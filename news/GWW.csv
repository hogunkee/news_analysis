0,GWW,"Breakouts don't always work. That doesn't mean the stock is automatically a failure.The failures start when a stock clears a proper buy point, then falls back more than 8% below that mark. This triggers the golden sell rule: Get out no deeper than 8% below your purchase price.But then what?Keep in mind that a failed breakout doesn't necessarily signal a failed stock. Many stocks with solid fundamentals recover, retake buy points and make winning runs. In some cases, the stock was ready to rally, but the market was not. Remember, breakouts tend to work better when the general market is in a confirmed uptrend.W.W. Grainger (GWW), a maintenance and industrial supplies distributor, has been in an uptrend since July 2009.The base, begun in July 2011, was V-shaped (1) and featured heavy selling on the left side. Poor characteristics.Grainger still managed to form a handle with a 156.95 buy point and broke out in strong trade Sept. 13 (2). The stock climbed for three days, then hit a peak of 165.55 and reversed. Over the next several days it dove more than 8% below the buy mark.In the process, it carved through its 50-day moving average in strong trade. But it also found firm support at its 200-day moving average (3).Buyers who got burned by the faulty breakout may have gone looking for other candidates into which to rotate cash. But Grainger proved it wasn't yet a goner. Let's say you've done your homework on the stock. If it has leadership-grade fundamentals, there's no harm in keeping an eye on it.A rebound from support at the 200-day line and a rise back through the prior base's 156.95 buy point put Grainger back in play.In the meantime, keep tabs on signs of heavy accumulation. Up days in higher volume and closes that are in the top half of the trading range suggest that institutions may be quietly at work, picking up shares.Grainger closed at the top of its trading range for the first three days above 200-day support (4). Volume rose on the first and third days, too. Good signs. It retook the buy point Oct. 12 in mild volume. Not yet a buy.Four trading sessions later, Grainger stormed past the 156.95 buy point in the original cup with handle on Oct. 18 with a 7% gain in nearly double its average trade (5). It climbed 41% in just five months, giving investors plenty of chances to sell on the way up for an excellent short-term gain.(Editor's Note: A version of this story originally ran in the Jan. 19, 2012, edition of IBD.

26,GWW,"The $13.7 billion Amazon (AMZN) acquisition of natural foods grocer Whole Foods Market (WFM) Friday stunned the market, clobbered grocery stocks, and spurred jokes and jibes in Twitterverse. One wag tweeted ""@jeffbezos this wasn't exactly the wealth redistribution we had in mind when you'd asked yesterday.""Bezos to Alexa: ""I need some groceries.""Alexa: ""I bought you Whole Foods.""🙃😋🍏🍎🍐🍊🍋🍕📈📊— Samppa Lahtinen (@SamppaSOS) June 16, 2017So where could Amazon go next? Here are five potential industries for the e-commerce giant.XAmazon already was said to be considering an entry into the pharmaceuticals market. While speculation had centered on online drug deliveries, Amazon also could conceivably add pharmacies to Whole Foods locations, several analysts noted Friday, creating further synergies between food and drugs and online orders and in-store purchases.If Amazon enters the field, it could send tremors across the pharmaceutical food chain, from drugstore chains such as Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) and CVS Health (CVS) to pharmacy benefit managers such as Express Scripts (ESRX) and distributors such as Amerisource Bergen (ABC).Amazon did have a finger in this pie once. It backed Drugstore.com before that online retail pharmacy was acquired by Walgreens, which then shut it down.Walgreens shares fell 5% and CVS Health 3.8%, though that reflected at least in part the immediate investor concern about the impact on their food sales. Express Scripts and Amerisource Bergen also were lower.Amazon Business, its B2B or business-to-business unit launched in 2015, sold over $1 billion worth of lab equipment, deep fryers and other gear sought by business owners in the first year of operations.If the division continues to grow at such a torrid pace, it could eat the lunch of W.W. Grainger (GWW), HD Supply (HDS) and other firms in the industrial supplies sector. That market is extremely fragmented, with some 5,000 estimated players and a value of about $75 billion per year. Amazon could disrupt it with a streamlined marketplace.While HD Supply fell 1% Friday, Grainger rose 2%.Meanwhile home improvement stores Home Depot (HD), Lowe's (LOW) and Floor & Decor (FND) have been Amazon-proof so far, but that may not always stay true.Amazon has automotive ambitions too. That is, it is rumored to want to move aggressively auto parts, carving out a slice of the $50 billion DIY aftermarket parts market.News that it is eyeing the auto-parts retail sector sent brick-and-mortar retailers such as AutoZone (AZO), O'Reilly Auto Parts (ORLY) and Advance Auto Parts (AAP) sharply lower in January. One report at that time said the online juggernaut already has contracts with Dorman Products (DORM) and other parts makers.Shares of auto-parts retailers are still mired near 52-week lows, with AutoZone 3.1%, O'Reilly Auto 1.1% and Advance Auto Parts 0.75% all falling Friday.Messaging service Slack Technologies targets the corporate chat room. That is said to make the Silicon Valley startup attractive to Amazon, which is a big player in the enterprise services market alongside Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL) and others.Having a messaging service could help win corporate business for Amazon Web Services. Microsoft and Google, which have their own cloud-computing businesses, have Slack-like messaging features.AWS has been key to the internet giant's streak of stellar earnings. In fact, Whole Foods could switch allegiance to Amazon Web Services from its current status as a Microsoft cloud customer given Friday's news.Slack is said to have a value of at least $9 billion, so it would be the biggest-ever acquisition for Amazon, surpassing Whole Foods.Amazon issued $1 billion in small loans in the past year to merchants on its online platform, Bloomberg reported June 7. It issues loans to sellers in the United States, United Kingdom and Japan and has plans to expand to key markets such as China.As its lending business gains momentum, Amazon could weigh on online lenders such as Lending Club (LC) as well as payment processors such as PayPal (PYPL) and Square (SQ), who also offer credit to users. Banks that lend heavily to small businesses could also take a hit.The lending program could also keep customers loyal to Amazon, which is seeing rivals such as eBay (EBAY) and Wal-Mart (WMT) step up their e-commerce strategy.Amazon's lending program, launched in 2011, allows it to profit both directly and indirectly — through interest rates and from more transaction fees as merchants grow sales.Shares of Amazon were rising 2.4% to 987.71 on the stock market today. Whole Foods rose 29.1% to 42.68, slightly above Amazon's 42 offer price.RELATED:What Amazon's Whole Foods Deal Means For RetailAmazon-Whole Foods Merger Could Be 'Category Killer' For Food, EateriesNew Flooring Retailer Manages To Sidestep The Amazon Squeeze

27,GWW,"X Network security stocks led the market Monday as a pervasive cyberattack threatened to unleash a second wave around the world.The Nasdaq was up 0.4%. Amazon.com (AMZN) was down slightly but volume was big enough to make it one of the most heavily traded stocks on the day.The S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average also were up 0.4%, just off their session highs. The small-cap Russell 2000 led with a 1% increase. Volume was tracking higher on the Nasdaq compared with the same time Friday, but was flat on the NYSE.Security software stocks were up more than 4% in afternoon trading. Symantec (SYMC), which last week struggled to hold its 31.20 buy point, was back above the entry. Most notably in that group, Proofpoint (PFPT) broke out of a cup-type base with an 84.46 buy point. Volume was tracking about four times the stock's 50-day average.Goldman Sachs upgraded Proofpoint, FireEye (FEYE) and Mimecast (MIME), saying it expects those companies to benefit the most from the WannaCry ransomware attack. Security experts believe another wave of computers will be hit by the attack this week.Proofpoint went public at 13 a share in April 2012. Currently, the stock holds a 79 Earnings Per Share Rating, but this rating is weighed down by net losses scored from 2008 to 2015. In 2016, the Sunnyvale, Calif., firm posted its first annual net profit as a publicly traded company, earning 37 cents a share.Now, the Street sees Proofpoint earning 12 cents a share in Q2, double vs. a year ago, and 58 cents a share for FY 2017, up 57%.Imperva (IMPV) broke out of a cup-with-handle base, rising past the 48.77 buy point in heavy volume. The base is part of a much larger pattern that stretches out to the start of 2016. Imperva is another member of the security software industry group, but is not a leader like Proofpoint or Symantec.Energy, chip and cyclical stocks such as machinery makers were among the best performing in today's trading.Yet on the downside, building products firms have been struggling lately.W.W. Grainger (GWW) fell 2% to the lowest level since January 2016.

28,GWW,"If Federal Reserve Chairman Janet Yellen shops at Amazon.com (AMZN) like most Americans, she might pick up insights from the e-commerce behemoth to help her set future interest rates.In fact, Yellen & Co. might want to include Amazon in the mix when discussing oil, housing, health care and other inflationary costs that can signal whether to tap the brakes or let the economy keep rolling.""Amazon is killing lots of businesses. In the process, it may also be killing inflation,"" Ed Yardeni, noted economist and president of Yardeni Research, said in a recent report.Using Chief Executive Jeff Bezos' playbook, Amazon has pummeled rivals with price cuts enabled by its smart logistics and relentless drive toward efficiency. Labor-displacing warehouse robotics give Amazon a cost advantage, and it aims to one day deploy delivery drones to extend its edge all the way to the customer's doorstep.Amazon's casualty list already is formidable. Over the years, Amazon has left consumer-facing retailers such as Borders, Circuit City and Sports Authority in the dust. Department chains have been closing stores, unable to answer the e-commerce challenge.Now Amazon is taking on gargantuan retailers such as Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) and Costco Wholesale (COST). These big-box retailers are trying to fight back, and their main tool is cutting prices.And Amazon is impacting more parts of the U.S. economy as it expands from books, toys and electronics into apparel, groceries and entertainment. Cowen & Co. calls the ""$1.3 trillion U.S. grocery market Amazon's biggest potential source of revenue upside.""While Amazon's effect on the retail sector has grabbed headlines, there's also Amazon Business to consider. The online sales channel for business customers is sending prices down for industrial products, pressuring companies like W.W. Grainger (GWW).There's also Amazon Web Services, the fast-growing cloud computing business. A Citigroup report in April called the impact of AWS and cloud services ""deflationary"" on the information technology industry.For now, Fed officials say a tightening labor market has put upward pressure on wage costs. The Fed has hiked interest rates once this year, and is expected to do it twice more. The unemployment rate fell to 4.4% in April, below the structural rate and matching the lows of 2006-07.Yet some economists contend that Amazon's use of automation as it pushes into new markets looms as a long-term factor in restraining job and wage growth. Amazon's scale is unmatched. It's most conspicuous in the retail space.""Traditional retailers will struggle to compete with a business that generated an estimated $225 billion in global gross merchandise value in 2016, growing 29% year-over-year and has the discipline to operate at a 1% margin,"" said a recent Morgan Stanley report.The CEO of entertainment provider Liberty Media (LMCA), Greg Maffei, called Amazon a ""ridiculously scary"" rival at a financial conference May 9.Amazon ""has an ability, because of its scale, to invest at incredibly low or negative rates of return — because they can cross-subsidize, and the market is willing to suspend disbelief in future profitability,"" Maffei said.Economist Yardeni, meanwhile, compares Amazon's scale to that of China.""Amazon arguably has done as much as the Chinese to kill jobs and keep a lid on inflation by enabling fast and easy price discovery for anyone with a cellphone,"" he said.Amazon has quickly gained traction in apparel and is now the second-biggest retailer behind Wal-Mart. Now it's taking Wal-Mart head-on.A longtime price discounter itself, thanks to Chinese manufacturing partners, Wal-Mart has seen profits shrink amid Amazon's online onslaught.Wal-Mart in April began offering price discounts for 10,000 items that consumers buy online and then pick up in stores. By June, Wal-Mart plans to expand web discounting to 1 million items.Since it purchased e-commerce startup Jet.com last year, Wal-Mart has ratcheted up its battle with Amazon. Wal-Mart in January rolled out free, two-day shipping for orders over $35. Amazon last week cut its minimum order to $25.Another big-box retailer, Costco, is dealing with Amazon's push into new food categories. While Costco has a strong membership program, its best counterpunch is pricing, says a Piper Jaffray report.""Costco is cheaper than Amazon in consumables,"" the report said.Making competition intensify is the fact that consumers doing comparison shopping can do so on mobile phones as well as on home PCs.""Certainly online vs. in-store shopping has been a trend for over a decade. What seems new is the comparison shopping that is pervasive,"" said Don Rissmiller, economist at Strategas Research Partners.""This could be related to Amazon, but it's also that we have mobile devices with fast, readily available networks, and the apps to check the price of various items,"" Rissmiller said. ""What we do know is the retail deflator turned negative in recent years and the Fed should absolutely pay attention.""Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, says it's clear that Amazon's success is weighing on prices for many retail goods. ""But the impact on overall inflation is small,"" Zandi told IBD.""The retail goods that Amazon provides account for only about 15% of the consumer basket,"" Zandi said. ""So, if Amazon is responsible for reducing retail goods inflation by 1 percentage point per annum — an aggressive assumption — then this will reduce overall inflation by 0.15%. Not inconsequential, but not a game changer.""Meanwhile, Amazon's stock price continues to soar, having spent 20 years on the market as of Monday. Shares have grown roughly 64,000% from its split-adjusted IPO of $1.50 and doubled from an already formidable price of 474 a share, reached in February 2016. Shares ended trading Monday at 957.97, off a fraction.Analysts continue to see Amazon going well past the 1,000 level. On Monday, Oppenheimer was the latest, raising its price to 1,100 from 970, and calling Amazon a ""must own"" stock.In another part of the economy, information technology, Amazon also is a disrupter. Amazon's cloud-computing business is by far the biggest provider of computing resources via the internet, followed by Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google and others.As corporate America outsources more computing work to AWS and other highly automated cloud services, companies buy less hardware and software for internal data centers and cut back on IT staffing.In the March quarter, IBM's (IBM) hardware business fell nearly 17% to $2.5 billion year-over-year, reflecting the impact of cloud adoption. How do the likes of IBM, Cisco Systems (CSCO) and Hewlett Packard Enterprises (HPE) fight back? By cutting prices.""Cloud is deflationary and collapses markets,"" said a Citigroup report in April.""Labor, with 85% deflation in the cloud, has the most significant disruption from cloud economics,"" says the Citi report. It says 15 IT staffers in a public, shared cloud service can replace 100 in a private data center.AWS will rake in some $37.5 billion in revenue by 2020, up from $17 billion this year, estimates Citigroup.Since 2006, AWS has been steadily cutting prices for cloud services, with Google and Microsoft following suit. Customers pay cloud service providers as little as pennies an hour per server or as much as $1-$2 an hour, depending on the type of workload. Even with low prices, AWS operating income doubled in 2016 to $3.1 billion, owing to massive scale.""Perhaps most importantly, AWS' juicy operating profit margin of more than 25% gives Amazon a way to fund its new ventures and a retail business that has notoriously skinny margins,"" said Yardeni. ""The cash and financial flexibility AWS provides ensure that Amazon will be a lethal competitor in the retailing industry for many years to come.""Long-range, Amazon's influence on job growth and the economy could grow if rivals duplicate its strategies to stay competitive.In fact, Amazon is pushing in the direction of its competitors, driving its automation beyond warehouses and into the retail space. Amazon hopes to eliminate store cashiers at Amazon Go convenience stores now being tested. Amazon Go stores use sensors to track items as shoppers put them into baskets. The shopper's Amazon account gets automatically charged.Amazon recently was granted a patent for automated, ""on-demand apparel manufacturing."" The patent highlights plans to go beyond clothing into other fabric-based products, such as footwear, bedding and home goods.Amazon is also bringing more of its logistics and delivery operations in-house.""We're in the early stages of drones disrupting the trucking industry and transportation costs,"" David Rosenberg, chief economist at Gluskin Sheff, told IBD. ""We're reaching an inflection point with robotics and automation, artificial intelligence and the shared economy. Most of these are massive supply-side deflationary developments.""Rosenberg says Amazon is part of a new industrial revolution that could push wages down.""Amazon and e-commerce are part and parcel of the fourth industrial revolution,"" he said.

29,GWW,"W.W. Grainger (GWW) shares are plummeting Tuesday after issuing worse-than-expected first-quarter results and shrinking sales and earnings expectations for the year, the latest nuts-and-bolts warning for industrial and construction markets.Earnings at the industrial-products supplier fell more than 9% to $2.88 a share as revenue notched up 1% to $2.54 billion, below Street expectations for $2.99 a share and $2.56 billion in sales.A ""stronger-than-anticipated customer response"" to pricing actions in the U.S. weighed on results, said CEO D.G. Macpherson in the release.""Based on the positive customer response thus far, we are pulling forward the remaining pricing actions originally scheduled for 2018 into the third quarter of this year,"" he said in the statement. ""This decision requires a significant change to our earnings per share guidance for the year but should enable us to accelerate growth with existing customers and attract new customers sooner than planned.""Grainger plunged 11.4% to 197.57 in the stock market today, crashing to a 14-month low.Grainger's slide follows Fastenal (FAST) and MSC Industrial Direct's (MSM) respective tumbles on earnings-result days. Fastenal sank 8.1% last Wednesday after reporting in-line profit and sales that beat slightly. MSC Industrial slid 6.2% on April 6, despite topping views, after offering Q3 guidance that disappointed. Fastenal fell 3.4% Tuesday, while MSC Industrial lost 3.85%.The recent reports from industrial and construction suppliers raise concerns about the health of the economy, as sentiment and other ""soft"" data start to fade and ""hard"" economic reports remain sluggish. Housing starts fell more than expected in March to a four-month low, the Commerce Department said Tuesday. Meanwhile, March industrial production sank the most since August on declining auto output.However, retail home and building supply chains Home Depot (HD) and Lowe's (LOW) remain standouts. Both Home Depot and Lowe's edged higher intraday Tuesday, near record highs.IBD'S TAKE: Home Depot and Lowe's shares are acting well amid a struggling market, consolidating near record highs after breaking out around their last earnings reports that showed accelerating growth.In recent months, competition from Amazon.com (AMZN) — in the form of its business-to-business segment — has emerged as a worry among industrial-product suppliers.Macpherson told trade publication Industrial Distribution in March that he views Amazon both as a rival and a customer.""We view them as a competitor that we're watching closely,"" he told the outlet. ""We don't know where it's going to evolve, but we feel like if we step on the advantages we have around technical products or our sales and service model, our fulfillment, we're going to be in good shape.""The bulk of Grainger's sales are now online.Amazon shares rose 0.2% to 903.48 intraday.For 2017, Grainger now expects per-share profit of $10-$11.30 and 1%-4% in sales growth, down from prior guidance for $11.30-$12.40 EPS and a 2%-6% revenue increase.That comes in well below current analysts forecasts for $11.85 EPS and nearly 4% sales growth for the year.RELATED:HD Supply Falls To 3-Month Low On Earnings Guidance

34,GWW,"Over the past few weeks, the Investor's Corner column has detailed a number of stocks with failed breakout attempts. Each one provided clues on how to read the warning signs and steer clear of others that show the same flaws.The failures start when a stock clears a proper buy point, then falls back more than 8% below that mark. This triggers the golden sell rule: get out no deeper than 8% below your purchase price.But then what?Keep in mind that a failed breakout doesn't necessarily signal a failed stock. Many stocks with solid fundamentals recover, retake buy points and make winning runs. In some cases, the stock was ready to rally, but the market was not.Let's look at W.W. Grainger (GWW), a maintenance and industrial supplies distributor, had been in an uptrend since July 2009. The base, begun in July, was V-shaped (1) and featured heavy selling on the left side -- poor characteristics.It still managed to form a handle with a 156.95 buy point and broke out in strong trade Sept. 19 (2). The stock climbed for three days, then hit a peak of 165.55 and reversed. Over the next several days it dove more than 8% below the buy mark.In the process, it carved through its 50-day moving average in strong trade. But it also found firm support at its 200-day moving average (3).Buyers who got burned by the faulty breakout may have gone looking for other candidates into which to rotate cash. But Grainger proved it wasn't yet a goner.Let's say you've done your homework on the stock. If it has leadership-grade fundamentals, there's no harm in keeping an eye on it.A rebound from support at the 200-day line and a rise back through the prior base's 156.95 buy point put Grainger back in play.In the meantime, keep tabs on signs of heavy accumulation. Up days in higher volume and closes in the top half of the trading range suggest institutions may be quietly at work, picking up shares.Grainger closed at the top of its trading range for the first three days above 200-day support (4). Volume rose on the first and third days, too. Good signs. It retook the buy point Oct. 12 in mild volume. Not yet a buy.Grainger hovered for three days, then broke out Oct. 18 with a 7% gain in nearly double its average trade (5). It then quickly climbed 29%.(Editor's Note: This column originally published in the Jan. 19, 2012, edition of IBD.)
"
35,GWW,"While exchange traded funds are ideal for producing short- and long-term investment gains, many ETFs can be deployed to generate steady income from stock dividends and bond interest.ETF investment strategies for generating income fall into five main categories:The highest yielding U.S. bond ETF tracked by Morningstar Inc. right now is SPDR Barclays High Yield Bond (JNK). Its 12- month yield sits near 6%. It's followed by First Trust Tactical High Yield (HYLS) yielding 5.6% and SPDR Short-Term High Yield Bond ETF (SJNK) yielding 5.5%.But seeing a fat yield on an ETF can be misleading. A big payout doesn't mean as much if the fund's total return is slipping. JNK has returned 11.31% year to date and an average annual 2.53% the past three years. That compares with 7.16% and 4.13% for HYLS and 10.8% and 1.64% for SJNK.Ranked by three-year returns, the top performer is Pimco 25+ Year Zero Coupon U.S. Treasury (ZROZ), up an average annual 18.39% the past three years and 20.44% year to date, and yielding just over 2%. It is followed by Vanguard Extended Duration Treasury (EDV), up 17.1% and 18.6% over the respective periods, and yielding 2.4%. Next is iShares 20 Year Treasury Bond, at 11.8% and 13.1%, and yielding 2.2%.Junk bonds and long-duration Treasury bonds are subject to bouts of heightened volatility, which investors looking for income often seek to avoid. So they're better off using ETFs that track these kinds of bonds as part of a diversified portfolio that contains steadier bonds.The benchmark for diversified bond portfolios is the Barclays Aggregate Bond index, which is made up of a broad array of investment-grade bonds. The index is tracked by iShares Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Fund (AGG), which has $190 billion in assets. It's up 5% year to date and an average annual 3.96% the past three years. It yields 2.3%.Those who prefer bonds need to be aware that anticipated interest-rate hikes could affect potential returns.In general, bond ETFs with higher durations will be more negatively impacted than those with shorter durations as expectations increase for higher rates. Duration is a measure of the sensitivity of bond price to changes in interest rates. Duration is tied to a bond's maturity, or the date at which the bond's principal is repaid to lenders. Investors can check an ETF's website for the average duration.For example, if rates rise, a long-term ETF such as iShares 20 Year Treasury (TLT) incurs more interest rate risk than iShares 3-7 Year Treasury (IEI), notes Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF Research at S&P Global Market Intelligence.""In short, if rates trend higher over time, returns for bond ETFs will be negatively impacted, but not equally,"" he said. ""However, one rate hike by the Fed should not be that impactful.""The highest yielding ETFs can bring big payouts, but if the quality of their holdings declines, the total return could be sapped by declining prices in unfavorable markets. The top yielding dividend stock ETF is Global X SuperDividend Alternatives (ALTY), paying out 8.2% of its stock price annually. It's a small, young ETF with just $3 million in assets and without a three-year record. It's up almost 19% this year.Its older and bigger sibling, $807.4 million Global X SuperDividend (SDIV), yields 6.7% and has gained 12% this year and an average annual 11.27% the past three years.High-yield stock investors tend to prefer stocks whose declines are about over. In that way investors can reap big payouts for each dollar invested with the hopes of capital appreciation as the business turns around. Not all ETFs screens for stocks in this way. One that does is Global X SuperDividend U.S. ETF (DIV). Its index methodology screens for stocks that have exhibited low betas relative to the S&P 500 in an effort to produce low-volatility of returns. It's up 9% this year and has risen an average annual 6.8% the past three years. Top holdings include Cone Midstream Partners (CNNX) and Invesco Mortgage Capital (IVR).At the other end of the spectrum, lower yielding ETFs invest in companies that have a long history of increasing dividends. Only top quality companies can increase payouts year after year, and they tend to be in big demand by investors looking for steady capital appreciation. Their stock prices rarely get whacked to the point where they have big yields.Vanguard Dividend Appreciation (VIG) tracks the Nasdaq U.S. Dividend Achievers Select Index. It holds 185 stocks, each of which has grown dividends annually for 10 years or more. It yields 2.1% vs. SPDR S&P 500's (SPY) 2%. Top holdings include Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Microsoft (MSFT) and Pepsi (PEP)ProShares S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats (NOBL) holds 50 stocks, a smaller list that reflects a higher barrier to entry -- each holding has raised dividends every year for 25 years or more. It yields 1.8%. Top holdings include Cintas (CTAS), W.W. Grainger (GWW) and S&P Global (SPGI).SPDR S&P Dividend (SDY), which invests in dividend aristocrats from the S&P Composite 1500, has jumped 15% year to date. It yields 2.4%. Top holdings include property REIT HCP (HCP), People's United Financial (PBCT) and Caterpillar (CAT).Safe to say, MLPs are best left to the pros who know when to get in or out, or how to use them as portfolio diversifiers.Morningstar tracks 20 REIT ETFs. The top-performing one year to date is Global X SuperDividend REIT (SRET). It's up 27.4% this year and yields about 8%, the third-highest. The index it tracks, the Solactive Global SuperDividend REIT index, invests in 30 of the highest dividend-yielding REITs in the world with the least amount of volatility.Nearly all of the $33 million ETF's assets are invested in North America. Top holdings include mortgage REITs Annaly Capital Management (NLY), which yields 10.1%, and Chimera Investment (CIM), yielding nearly 12%, as well as property REIT Senior Housing Properties Trust (SNH) yielding 6.6%. The REIT was launched in March 2015.The biggest REIT ETF is $35.59 billion Vanguard REIT (VNQ). It's up 14% year to date and yields 3.3%. Its top holdings along with their year-to-date price performance include Simon Property (SPG), up 12%, Public Storage[ticker symb=PSA] down 7%, and Prologis (PLD) up 30%. They all yield about 3%.Convertible bonds are bonds that can be exchanged for a set number of the issuing company's common stock. They tend to carry lower interest than normal corporate bonds but have the potential for greater price appreciation.The top performing ETF in this area year to date is $471 million VanEck Vectors Preferred Securities ex Financials (PFXF). It's up 12% and yields 5.6%. The largest is $17.86 billion iShares U.S. Preferred Stock (PFF). It's up 3.8% this year and yields 5.74%.RELATED:The Latest ETF News

36,GWW,"Today's Investor's Corner kicks off a short series of articles detailing why some breakouts fail and how to handle them when they do.Failures are not at all unusual. They are generally simple to handle so long as you cut losses and keep a careful eye on your quarry.Teen retail chain rue21 staged what looked like a very solid breakout on July 7, 2011 (1) (weekly chart is shown). The five-month cup with handle was just 23% deep. The base was a first-stage pattern, and the stock had been public for less than two years, also a plus.But some red flags were waving.Institutional activity over the course of the base was skewed toward distribution. This activity rippled into the handle (2). The volume, rather than drying up along the length of the handle, was jerky, with heavier weekly volume on the downside. This isn't the kind of orderly shakeout you like to see ahead of a breakout.The handle also dipped nearly 15%, beyond the 12% limit that defines a well-behaved stock.The breakout, a powerful 8% spike in better than double its average trade, past a 34.93 buy point did not erase these elements of risk.Rue21 rose for two days, then began a rapid pullback in generally light trade. It dropped to a test of 50-week support, violating the 8% sell rule July 27 (3). Technically, this marked a failed breakout.In real terms, the breakout still had a fighting chance. A great many breakouts -- particularly in the challenging market of late -- have pulled back below the 8% loss level, then reversed to retake the buy point and move on to new highs.Recent examples include Hi-Tech Pharmacal and Starbucks (SBUX) in September and October 2011. More recently, Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG), Nu Skin Enterprises (NUS) and W.W. Grainger (GWW) have recovered after triggering the golden sell rule to retake new highs.The lesson: Keep your eye on the ball, even if it has failed.Rue21's death knell came in the first two sessions of August (4). The stock cut its 50-day moving average with a big loss in mildly above-average trade Aug. 1 (please see a daily chart). On Aug. 2, it sliced its 200-day line with an even larger drop in heavier volume.The stock has since failed to regain its 50-day moving average. It's 42% below the July buy point.(Editor's Note: This story was originally published in the Jan. 9, 2012, edition of IBD.)
"
37,GWW,"ClearBridge Large Cap Growth Fund (SBLGX) makes a habit of staying on top. The now-$3.5 billion portfolio's 15.72% average annual return over the five years ended July 29 ranked No. 5 among all large-cap growth funds tracked by Morningstar Inc.It was also in the top 3% and top 5% among its direct rivals over the past 12 months and three years.How does the fund do it? Co-manager Peter Bourbeau, who has been at the helm since July 15, 2009, says he and Margaret Vitrano -- co-manager since Oct. 11, 2012 -- stick to a few techniques, including investing in just their best ideas and investing in not one but several types of growth stocks.The results speak loud and clear. Their fund was in the top 33% of all U.S. diversified stock mutual funds last month. And their track record has made them an IBD Best Mutual Funds of 2016 award winner. The fund outperformed the S&P 500 over the one-, three-, five- and 10-year periods ended Dec. 31.Forty-eight-year-old Bourbeau, who is based in Manhattan, spoke with IBD about his investment approach, while he was on the road in Nashville, Tenn.IBD: Peter, you hold three types of growth stocks: cyclical, stable and what you call select. Why not just focus on one?Bourbeau: We believe different types of growth companies will perform better at various stages of a market cycle. We seek to deliver solid performance through the full cycle by owning a diversified portfolio of growth companies which we divide into three categories of growth stocks or buckets: stable, cyclical and select.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Six-Month LeadersThe select bucket of growth stocks -- which has about 35% of our assets -- are elite growers with disruptive technologies or business models. These are growing earnings at a double-digit rate. We base our growth projections on the size of the addressable market. Facebook (FB), for instance, will only invest in new opportunities that represent 1 billion or more potential users. These companies often look expensive because many of them, like Amazon (AMZN) with aggressive capital spending on its web services business, invest heavily to support future growth. This focus on long-term value creation tends to make them volatile.The stable bucket has about 50% to 65% of our assets. These are stocks like Home Depot (HD) and Microsoft (MSFT). They are industry-leading companies that are growing earnings slightly above average on a very consistent basis. It's this long-term compounding of earnings and cash flows which gives these companies so many options to create shareholder value such as stock buybacks, acquisitions or dividend payments.Comcast (CMCSA), for example, recently announced the acquisition of DreamWorks Animation (DWA). Anheuser-Busch InBev (BUD) last year purchased SABMiller. Disney (DIS) has the cash to expand its theme parks globally with the opening of a park in Shanghai.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Category PerformanceOur cyclical-stocks bucket has companies whose revenue or profits are depressed for reasons that we think are fixable. Cyclical growers maintain the growth characteristics that we look for, but have issues with a visible inflection point. As patient, long-term investors, we can take advantage of price dislocations caused by near-term headwinds to establish new positions or dollar cost average into existing positions at attractive valuations.Schlumberger (SLB) and Grainger (GWW) are two. American Express (AXP) has faced revenue pressure on the top end by (JPMorgan) Chase (JPM) and Visa (V), and on the bottom by Capital One (COF) and Discover (DFS).IBD: And why do you prefer to be concentrated?Bourbeau: We usually have 40 to 50 names. We're around 47 now. We have 15% annual turnover, so we hold for eight to 10 years on average.We're concentrated because we're looking for the No. 1 leader in a market. Those companies have the highest margins, best free cash flow. They take over weaker companies. They become bigger and more powerful, harder to compete with. They have visionary men and women. Great companies remain great for a long time. Who needs the No. 2 or 3 company?IBD: Give me an example, please, as of your latest disclosure.Bourbeau: Sure. Schlumberger's rivals include Halliburton (HAL) (in oilfield services) and Baker Hughes (BHI) (in oil & gas machinery). But Schlumberger is three times bigger than Halliburton (in terms of market capitalization), its nearest rival in oil field services. (And more than five times the size of Baker Hughes.) It is by far the leader in products, distribution, margins. It is the favorite partner of exploration and production companies and integrated multinationals.IBD: What's your Facebook thesis?Bourbeau: Its rare business model takes advantage of the move of advertising from old media to new and to mobile from the desktop.They bought WhatsApp, they've got Messenger, they've got Instagram. And look at what they've done with video. They're building apps for billions of users as opposed to some of their smaller competitors.If you're an advertiser, you're getting targeting that you never had before. It can be refined down to age, demographic, gender, likes and dislikes. Your ads' effectiveness goes higher. And Facebook is just beginning this movement.IBD: Is Amazon the same -- one innovation building on another?Bourbeau: You're frustrated as investors, seeing huge ramp-ups in capital expenditures. But you know they're also seeing opportunities that we mere mortals could never see. Amazon Web Services started as a pet project for their retail operation. They built an infrastructure that they used maybe one month a year, then they wondered how to use it the rest of the year, and it grew 50%, 60%, 70%. They created an industry, renting software vs. buying it, which (Amazon founder and CEO) Jeff Bezos says will be bigger than retail.What's next? We don't know. Logistics? Moving packages around the world? Not all of their innovations will work. And we're aware of stretched valuations. But an innovative company with $10 billion in free cash flow gives us no reason to be alarmed.IBD: You boosted your stake in VMware (VMW) not long ago. Why?Bourbeau: This is another innovative company that created an entire business, which is server virtualization. Now, that's the mature part of their business. They still have a massive lead, but that will erode over time.They have another suite of products. And creating an easy user experience to a hybrid cloud is something they're going to have a leadership position in. They made acquisitions in network virtualization. One was Nicira (in 2012). They've got deployment to paying customers. The value proposition vs. Cisco Systems (CSCO) is early, but if it works it will be a massive home run.To be balanced, the Dell acquisition (of EMC (EMC), which owns a stake in VMware) was unfortunate. Structuring the deal with tracking stock (that mimicked shares of VMware) punished equity in VMware and made a messy transition. But we're finally toward the tail end of that. VMware will operate as a public company.It has double-digit free cash flow yield. It is a very cheap asset. They've got a huge buyback in place. It is a name we continue to like.IBD: Another position you've boosted is Xilinx (XLNX). Why?Bourbeau: This is an interesting company. They don't own their own manufacturing. They design intricate, high-power chips for very particular applications like cell towers, moving massive data, programmable logic device (PLD) chips that can handle enormous amounts of instructions and can change instructions on a chip remotely.They're used in defense. There are 17 PLD chips in the Mercedes S-class cars. And the fact that they don't manufacture them means this is almost a software company in terms of margins. Lastly, this was a duopoly. But Intel (INTC) bought Altera, so Xilinx could be an acquisition target down the road, not that's that what we're playing for.IBD: Cyclicals that you like or added to recently -- American Express, Schlumberger, VMWare, Xilinx: only VMWare has average growth of 10% or faster in the last three and five years. Only Schlumberger has expected earnings north of 10% in 2017. Do these companies need faster growth to get their stocks moving? When will that happen?Bourbeau: Growth rates are not the main criteria with cyclical stocks. We target an inflection point for each. If reached, it should cause earnings to normalize and stock valuation to increase.Here are their inflection points. For SLB, they include crude oil prices reaching supply-demand equilibrium and global production ramping up. Also, 65% incremental margins, which is a lot higher than any other recovery. For AXP: normalization of business post Costco (which no longer accepts AmEx cards). Normal earnings growth rate should return in 2017. XLNX: product cycle and further application penetration as well as market share gains. VMW: we don't have a comment.IBD: How do you and Margaret Vitrano divide duties, running this fund?Bourbeau: We don't divide up the portfolio. We're devoted to the same process. But we each have a slight bias in our knowledge bases. Margaret, given her consumer discretionary and technology background, has different experiences from my health care and financials background. But when we look at companies, we're on the same calls at the same time. Our different backgrounds helps us fact-check each other.IBD: And who was your mentor, Peter?Bourbeau: The first was Richie Freeman, who has run ClearBridge Aggressive Growth (SHRAX) (since 1983, and whose co-manager now is Evan Bauman). We talk every day. He's just down the hall. We're constantly talking ideas, sports.But our portfolio construction is now a little different. Richie's turnover is zero. When he's comfortable with a name, he's on it forever. Margaret and I are more disciplined in valuation. Our turnover is 15%, which makes Richie's fund look like a hedge fund.If you look at sectors, Richie and Evan are eclectic. Richie is more likely to have zero in a given sector if he doesn't like it. That's not how Margaret and I look at the world. We have industrials, media (and something in every sector). And Richie can have significant overweights. And he is more all-market-capitalizations. Margaret and I are more large cap.

38,GWW,"Jerry Dodson's Parnassus Endeavor Fund (PARWX) proves that you can have your socially responsible cake and eat it too.The $1.5 billion mutual fund favors companies that provide employees with ""outstanding workplaces."" So do the five other funds at Parnassus Investments, which Dodson founded in 1984. That includes things like offering workers profit-sharing, time off for working parents, paid time off for volunteer work, fair treatment and clear communication.The investment team at Parnassus, which has $16.5 billion under management, also screen out companies engaged in the extraction, exploration, production, manufacturing or refining of fossil fuels.None of those criteria have prevented Endeavor from outperforming its peers or the broad market in the past 10 years.It is the top-performing environmental, social and corporate-governance (ESG) fund over the 10 years ended June 30, with an 11.57% average annual return in that decade, says Morningstar Inc. The S&P 500 averaged a 7.42% yearly gain in that span.The fund also ranks in the top 1% of all large-cap growth mutual funds in that period and the top 2% over the past five years.And it is an IBD Best Mutual Funds 2016 Awards winner, glowing in three categories — U.S. equity funds, growth funds and large caps. It outperformed the S&P 500 over the one-, three-, five- and 10-year periods ended Dec. 31.Through Q2, it was ahead of roughly 42% of all U.S. diversified stock funds so far this year.Dodson's affinity for ESG investing has deep roots. He founded Parnassus Investments at the age of 41 with those goals in mind. Earlier work was a harbinger of what was to come: A political science major as UC Berkeley, he got his MBA from Harvard Business School in 1971, then went on to work for a nonprofit outfit that helped minority-owned businesses. He helped organize Continental Savings of America, becoming the president and CEO of the S&L, which developed an innovative product for depositors to invest in solar energy projects.Dodson is lead manager on Parnassus Fund (PARNX) and Parnassus Asia Fund (PAFSX) and sole manager of Endeavor. From his office in San Francisco, 73-year-old Dodson talked with Investor's Business Daily about the ins and outs of his investment approach and how he began to use social screens.IBD: You're juggling two tough tasks: You not only use ESG criteria, you also run a concentrated portfolio. Which is tougher?Dodson: You know, the hard part was getting the philosophy and tweaking it with simulations, which was done over many years. Once we understood the strategy would work, the size of the portfolio just followed.You'll be surprised that we took advice from a journalist (about the size and strategy). I was social friends with Milton Moskowitz, who was writing a news story that started as a book. It was about the 100 best places to work.I looked at the returns of the 50% to 60% that were publicly traded ... and thought I should start a fund based on that. Milton thought I should stick with 100 companies. I disagreed. He said I'd screw it up.Anyway, it took years (of looking for fundamental metrics that correlated to good stock performance). It took about two years of back-testing on paper, then five more years of running the portfolio (before opening it to the public).IBD: Aside from ESG criteria, it looks to me as if you seek large-cap companies with wide moats or strong competitive advantages, and quality management teams that act in the best interests of shareholders. Have I got it right?Dodson: That's it, succinctly.IBD: Information technology is your largest sector, with a 50% weighting as of March 31. Is that a typical exposure to tech?Dodson: It's usually been our largest sector, but not 50%. Normally it's around 30%. The reason is that we know the sector well. Silicon Valley is down the road from us and more and more right here in the city.Also, in terms of workplace, technology companies seem a step ahead in providing a good environment. Google -- Alphabet (GOOGL) now -- has generous maternity leave, a gym where you can work out, days off for doing charitable events.Compared to, say, the steel industry, workplace issues score stronger at tech companies.IBD: Speaking of Alphabet, it's been trending sideways since late April. Do you still like the stock?Dodson: We started buying at 525 in December 2014. Now it's up to (the low 700s). We think it will make more gains. But you're right, it's been pretty flat. We regard it as a long-term holding. It's got a great moat and a good social story.IBD: Why do you think it has more room to run?Dodson: Primarily because of its moat, and it's looking to develop new products. It has a huge cash stake, a talented workforce. Its search engine gives them (revenue and earnings) stability. I don't know what new ideas they're working on, but I know they're looking for new products and they'll find something.IBD: In general, you emphasize some ESG criteria more than others, right?Dodson: We are more focused on the workplace, how a company treats employees. Then the environment. Workplace is a component of ""social.""IBD: How is workplace part of ""social""?Dodson: The word ""social"" covers a lot. For us, it means how a company treats its employees. It can mean safety record, privacy policy, relationship to the community where the company operates, diversity programs and good, clear, honest communication.IBD: Do you ever invest in a stock because its E, S or G features are very attractive, even though its financial performance is not so bright?Dodson: In the past we've done that. I did it before Endeavor Fund, with Parnassus Fund (PARNX). The stock was Control Data (a supercomputer company). They would hire former prisoners, do great social things. But the business strategy was just OK. We invested, and it was one of the worst mistakes I ever had. It cured me of picking for environmental or social reasons alone.IBD: Let's talk about individual holdings as of your latest disclosure. Citrix Systems' (CTXS) earnings per share rose 51% and 82% the past two quarters. A lot of people think the enterprise software developer, specializing in desktop virtualization, lost its focus. It's in a reorganization that has involved layoffs of staff and contractors. How does this situation look to you?Dodson: The reason we invested was because of their GoToMeeting app (which is being spun off). GoToMeeting is similar to Citrix's XenApp. You can be thousands of miles away from your server, doing applications, and you can use it on your smartphone or laptop, and it delivers it safely on your mobile device. That's what makes them successful. People want applications, this company delivers them where you want.IBD: Your stake in Applied Materials' (AMAT) is up. Are you satisfied with their progress?Dodson: It was in the doldrums when we initiated a position in May 2009 at 11.22. Equipment used to make semiconductors tends to be volatile. Sales and earnings are very cyclical. We tried to buy at a time when the stock had fallen off, then ride it up. Now it's (rising). We believe Applied will benefit from significant order growth with its leading etch and deposition tools.IBD: Ciena's (CIEN) earnings per share have slowed from 625% growth three quarters ago to 50% growth and a 3% decline the past two frames. Everything OK there?Dodson: We've owned it quite a while. It's more volatile than we expected. It makes communication glass wires, equipment that moves impulses, whether they are voice or data, along transmission lines. Earnings have been lumpy because any time you have an equipment maker, it has ups and downs. We've held it through cycles. It's more volatile than we expected. But we like the company, and we think it has more upside.IBD: Why do you own C.H. Robinson Worldwide (CHRW)? It's not a tech story. And revenue has declined three quarters in a row.Dodson: It's a freight forwarder, focusing on trucking. You're right. It hasn't done well. That's primarily because shipping has not picked up as much as anticipated. The economy is growing (at an annualized rate of) 2% or less. To get trucking and freight forwarding growing, the economy has to grow more. So it's a play that the economic recovery will accelerate. But our average cost is 55. The stock is in the mid-70s, so we've done well.IBD: Charles Schwab's (SCHW) EPS grow has accelerated for two quarters, but share price has been weak. What's your play here?Dodson: We're tied in to them. We pay Schwab if customers come in through them.But the key? A lot of brokerage firms, including Schwab, collect interest on margin loans. With interest rates so low, they don't make much. But if interest rates increase, then there's a huge earnings increase for Schwab. It's in the mid-20s now. It would go to the 40s.If our economy gets better, rates will go up and Schwab will take off.IBD: Intel's (INTC) EPS growth is speeding up. Where's the growth for their computer chips coming from?Dodson: They make chips for personal computers, smartphones and other applications. They also make chips for servers. Those sales are going up.They've been trying for years to get into the mobile (devices) market. They finally have semiconductors going into the iPhone. They're trying to get more into communications and other growth areas. With this Apple (AAPL) chip and other missions, that's what we're banking on to move Intel higher.IBD: Procter & Gamble (PG) is the classic defensive stock. But revenue per share has declined for eight quarters. Is this what you want?Dodson: You're right about revenue declining. They've got these amazing brands: Crest, Tide, Gillette, Head & Shoulders. But they need a new growth engine. We're looking at it. Does it have growth ahead? We haven't reached a conclusion.IBD: IBM (IBM) EPS is down four straight quarters. Sales are down 16 frames in a row. Why invest in it?
"
39,GWW,"Dodson: My only defense is that Warren Buffett owns a lot more than I do. I first bought it at the end of 2013. I expected it to turn around as they cut emphasis on hardware. At some point, growth in (consulting and) software will offset declines in hardware. But it hasn't happened yet. At 10.7 times (forward) earnings, we believe share price is on the bargain table.IBD: Is Buffett selling?Dodson: No. We look when there's a filing, but we've seen no sign of (Buffett selling). I'm sure he's having the same regrets I have.IBD: W.W. Grainger's (GWW) EPS and sales finally notched gains after declining for two quarters. But shares are not making headway.Dodson: Grainger makes everything under the sun (for maintenance). This in some sense is a play on the overall economy. If the U.S. economy can grow fast enough, Grainger will do well because its products touch almost every sector of the economy.IBD: Gilead Sciences' (GILD) EPS and revenue growth have slowed in recent quarters. Do you still like this stock?Dodson: I was expecting sales to increase quite a bit for their hepatitis C product. But they had to cut prices because of competition. Both AbbVie (ABBV) and Merck (MRK) make therapies for hep C. Gilead is a great lab. They will develop new therapies. In time, the company should do well.IBD: This fund began with a different name. Why the name change, Jerry?Dodson: The way we pick stocks hasn't changed. We started out as the Workplace Fund. We had good performance early on, but the name Workplace Fund was not getting the attention we thought it should.People on our staff said we got strange reactions from brokers and advisors, who weren't sure what the name meant. ""Why not pick a more general name?"" they said. They said that would get more shareholder money, more acceptance.IBD: And why is the fund concentrated?Dodson: Primarily because I can't find enough companies that are undervalued that meet the workplace and social criteria.IBD: The fund has 25 names. How typical is that?Dodson: We would like to have 35 to 40 names. We're looking for more. The last couple years we went down to 25 or so.IBD: The fund had an 11% cash weighting as of May 31. Was that because it's hard to find your kind of stocks?Dodson: That's correct. I try to stay as fully invested as possible.IBD: Jerry, make my day: Before running this fund, did you run a totally non-PC fund -- you know, one that only invests in ammo, tobacco, oil?Dodson: Before Endeavor, I managed each of six (including one that no longer exists) other Parnassus funds prior to finding a manager for each of them. I founded Parnassus Investments in 1984. Prior to that, I worked for six years as president of a small bank in San Francisco. Before that, I spent four years as a foreign service officer with the Department of State, serving in Panama and Vietnam.IBD: What was your investment style before you embraced ESG?Dodson: We've embraced ESG since the firm was founded. It was one of our founding principles.IBD: What got you into ESG?Dodson: My personal philosophy had always revolved around ESG, but I wasn't sure it could be used as a business philosophy. At Continental, I started a program to allow savers to put their money into special savings accounts that would be lent out for solar energy installations. Much to my pleasant surprise, the program was very popular.It convinced me that there was a market out there for investors who wanted to make a positive impact with their money. This led to the founding of Working Assets Money Fund (1983-1984), which took ESG factors into account in investing in money market securities.This, in turn, led to the formation of Parnassus Investments.I took the ESG from my experience, then added the value-oriented philosophy of Benjamin Graham, whose writings I admired. These two strains formed the basis of the Parnassus investment philosophy.IBD: How did you come up with the Parnassus name?Dodson: I lived on a street near Parnassus Avenue in San Francisco. I looked up the mythology around Mount Parnassus in Greece and discovered it was the site of the Oracle of Delphi. I liked the image of the oracle often going against the prevailing wisdom. It fit my contrarian, value-oriented investment philosophy.IBD: Since you're 73, do you have plans to retire?Dodson: I plan to retire as chief executive officer in 2018 at 75. However, I plan to stay on indefinitely as manager of Endeavor until I find someone well-qualified to take over.

41,GWW,"Amazon (AMZN) is pushing deeper into business-to-business e-commerce, which one analyst estimates could add $18 billion in company revenue by 2020.The B2B unit, Amazon Business, began as Amazon Supply in 2012. The initiative was rebranded in April 2015 and Amazon -- which posted 2015 revenue of $107 billion -- recently indicated it reached more than $1 billion in annual sales, with 300,000 customers.Bank of America Merrill Lynch analyst Justin Post estimates Amazon Business will reach gross merchandise volume of $3.5 billion this year, resulting in revenue of $3 billion. He anticipates GMV of $8 billion next year and revenue of $6.4 billion. By 2020, estimates Post, Amazon will hit GMV of $25 billion and $18.6 billion in revenue.“Based on recent management comments, Amazon Business appears to be ready for prime time, and we wouldn’t be surprised if Amazon invests in marketing to raise awareness as Amazon’s procurement systems improve,” said Post in a research note.According to market research firm Frost & Sullivan, the U.S. B2B market is expected to reach $1 trillion in sales by 2020, and $6.7 trillion globally.“We think B2B provides significant runway for growth, which could help Amazon sustain its growth rates and premium valuation for many years,” wrote Post.He has a buy rating on Amazon stock, and a price target of 840.Amazon stock ended trading up more than 1%, to 704.20, in the stock market today, after touching a record high above 722 on May 12. It’s an IBD Leaderboard stock.Amazon Business sells a broad line of goods, such as office supplies, tools, industrial equipment, tractor equipment and office products. Competitors in the B2B e-commerce sector include Staples (SPLS), HD Supply Holdings (HDS), Office Depot (ODP), Grainger (GWW) and Fastenal (FAST).

42,GWW,"Today’s Investor’s Corner kicks off a short series of articles detailing why some breakouts fail and how to handle them when they do.Teen retail chain Rue 21 staged what looked like a very solid breakout on July 7, 2011, (1) (a weekly chart is shown). The five-month cup with handle was just 23% deep. The base was a first-stage pattern, and the stock had been public for less than two years, also a plus.But some red flags were waving.Institutional activity over the course of the base was skewed toward distribution. This activity rippled into the handle (2). The volume, rather than drying up along the length of the handle, was jerky, with heavier weekly volume on the downside. This isn’t the kind of orderly shakeout you like to see ahead of a breakout.The handle also dipped nearly 15%, beyond the 12% limit that defines a well-behaved stock.The breakout, a powerful 8% spike in better than double its average trade, past a 34.93 buy point, did not erase these elements of risk.Rue rose for two days, then began a rapid pullback in generally light trade. It dropped to a test of 50-week support, violating the 8% sell rule on July 27 (3). Technically, this marked a failed breakout.In real terms, the breakout still had a fighting chance. A great many breakouts -- particularly in a challenging market -- have pulled back below the 8% loss level, then reversed to retake the buy point and move on to new highs.Recent examples include Hi Tech Pharmacal and Starbucks (SBUX) in September and October. More recently, Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG), Nu Skin Enterprises (NUS) and W.W. Grainger (GWW) have recovered after triggering the golden sell rule to retake new highs.The lesson: Keep your eye on the ball, even if it has failed.Rue’s death knell came in the first two sessions of August 2011 (4). The stock cut its 50-day moving average with a big loss in mildly above-average trade Aug. 1. On Aug. 2, it sliced its 200-day line with an even larger drop in heavier volume.(Editor's Note: This column first ran on Investors.com on Jan. 6, 2012.)

"
123,GWW,"Jim Ryan met the wrath of the Great Recession when he took over W.W. Grainger in June 2008.The timing couldn't have been worse for Ryan to start his stint as CEO of North America's largest supplier of maintenance, repair and operating products to a number of sectors, including heavy manufacturing, retail, the government and contractors.Grainger's (GWW) sales volume was down along with the slumping economy. So Ryan and his team members, many of whom were new at their jobs, had to pull together and come up with a plan to get Grainger back on the growth track.""We had to get the costs out of the business,"" Ryan, 53, told IBD.Their solution was to reduce the company's workforce. For all of 2009, Grainger cut 600 posts.That was a tough call for Ryan.""Reducing head count is one of the most difficult decisions any of our leaders, including me, has to make,"" he said. ""Our people are the reason we succeed.""Ryan met that challenge by sticking to the company's philosophy: He treated the people let go with fairness, dignity and respect.For those who stayed on, he kept Grainger's strong benefit package, including a profit-sharing trust and service recognition prizes.On a business level, his top priority was to protect Grainger's signature customer service.""We decided we were going to stay true to what's helped make us successful in this business, which is providing a high level of customer service,"" said Ryan.The CutsRyan and his team reduced the head count primarily in posts where people weren't dealing directly with customers.He kept service levels at or near all-time highs through the recession, a tack he says helped differentiate Grainger in the marketplace.Thanks to Ryan's focus on that front, Grainger emerged from the downturn with vigor, boosting sales 15% to $7.16 billion in 2010.It kept up the fast pace in 2011, with a 12% pop to $8.1 billion. Its stock price soared along with that revenue, rocketing 277% from November 2008 to this past March.""That strong focus on customer service during the downturn paid dividends because customers came to us when they couldn't get the products or services they needed from our competitors,"" said Ryan, a 31-year Grainger veteran.In addition to his CEO post, he's been Grainger's president since 2006 and chairman since 2009.Grainger's sales were down only 9% from 2008 to 2009 while the industry's sank 18%, Ryan notes.And whatever business that Grainger gained at that time, the firm rode it out of the slump.""They successfully navigated the Great Recession,"" said R.W. Baird analyst David Manthey. ""Coming out of it, the company has seen revenue growth rates as well as gross and operating margins that have been much stronger than most would have expected. Consistent strong growth and operating profitability really speak to how effectively the company is being run today.""Grainger's fat catalog is a standard fixture in most maintenance departments. It includes everything from electrical switches to floor cleaners.The company also serves customers via multiple distribution channels, including over 700 branches and many websites.In all, customers can land 1 million products through Grainger.When customers need one of Grainger's products, often for emergencies like a power outage, they often need it right away. And facilities typically don't stock items they're not sure they'll use.That's where Ryan's commitment to customer service shifts into a crucial gear.Grainger's U.S. catalog carries over 400,000 products in stock.""Regardless of where you are in the U.S., we can get them to you today or tomorrow,"" the CEO said.Laura Brown, Grainger's senior vice president of communications and investor relations, lauds her boss' ""relentless focus"" on customer service. And ""if you have really good customer service, that tends to drive customer and employee loyalty and engagement as well. And when you have those things, good things happen. The business grows, you gain market share and have very strong financial results.""Ryan leads by example.""He's highly competitive and loves to win,"" said Brown. ""That spirit is contagious.""As CEO, Ryan has been instrumental in the ""cultural renaissance"" at Grainger, said Manthey. ""The former management team mostly built the IT and distribution platform the company has today. Jim Ryan, through effective decision making and execution, has used that platform to take Grainger to a new level of growth and profitability.""Historically, Grainger was seen as a conservative, steady, moderate growth company. Today, it is widely seen as one of the highest-quality industrial supply companies in the space.""Solid CourseRyan adheres to a philosophy that aligns with Grainger's corporate philosophy: ""Honesty, integrity, hard work and courage ultimately drive results. I found these are characteristics that build trust and winning teams. In my experience, talented and accomplished people often work for winning teams and with people they trust.""Grainger hires and promotes employees based on those traits. He says the standards have been in place since William W. Grainger founded the company in 1927.Ryan shares that management philosophy. That's why he sees Grainger as a great fit. ""This is a relationship business,"" he said. ""If people are not keeping products in stock, they have to rely on someone who knows the business and gets what they need when they need it."" So trust is as crucial as reliability.Ryan likes to point out how Grainger's employees provide the high level of service that shoppers require — and how his team helps customers reach their goals.Consider this story: A customer frantically entered a Grainger branch near Boston looking for steel-toed boots. The foreman had kicked him off a construction site for having the wrong footwear, and the worker risked losing a day's pay unless he found boots fast.After checking the inventory, a branch employee learned the store didn't have the right size in stock.He said to the customer, ""I'll be back in a minute,"" went to his locker and took out an extra pair of steel-toed boots. He put them on the counter and said, ""Here, use mine for the day — I will order you a pair and they'll be in tomorrow.""Ryan follows a simple formula to motivate employees: ""We work very hard to treat people fairly.""Grainger recognizes success in various ways. An employee can praise a teammate on the company's website. On a larger scale, top salespeople receive incentives for reaching goals. The firm also has an annual recognition event.Learning CurveNavigating the Great Recession wasn't the only challenge Ryan faced during his Grainger tenure.There were times he had to learn early how to lead without being the expert. That came into play when he was the company's chief information officer in 1995 without any formal tech training.""What I relied on was my strong knowledge of business and strong focus on the customer,"" he said. ""I was able to bring that customer focus and business knowledge to a technical organization.""At the same time, he promoted and hired people with strong technical expertise.Ryan, a Chicago native, got his first exposure to serving customers as a child delivering newspapers near the Windy City.He always had an eye for business. He graduated from Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, with a bachelor's degree in business. He earned a master's degree in business from DePaul University in Chicago with a focus on marketing.Ryan was drawn to Grainger in 1980 because of what he saw as growth potential and values consistent with his. Also, he says, the work looked like fun.Over the years, he held increasingly responsible posts in marketing, sales and service. He helped drive industry-leading service across all of Grainger's business channels, including its website.Now he's making his mark as CEO.

Grainger (GWW), a distributor of tools, lighting, plumbing and other facility-maintenance products to over 2 million customers in myriad industries, achieved its biggest yearly sales growth since 1997.

126,GWW,"Since Jan. 9, Investor's Corner has detailed a number of stocks with failed breakout attempts. Each one provided clues on how to read the warning signs and steer clear of others that show the same flaws.The failures start when a stock clears a proper buy point, then falls back more than 8% below that mark. This triggers the golden sell rule: get out no deeper than 8% below your purchase price.But then what?Keep in mind that a failed breakout doesn't necessarily signal a failed stock. Many stocks with solid fundamentals recover, retake buy points and make winning runs. In some cases, the stock was ready to rally, but the market was not.W.W. Grainger (GWW), a maintenance and industrial supplies distributor, has been in an uptrend since July 2009.The base, begun in July, was V-shaped 1 and featured heavy selling on the left side — poor characteristics.It still managed to form a handle with a 156.95 buy point and broke out in strong trade Sept. 13 2. The stock climbed for three days, then hit a peak of 165.55 and reversed. Over the next several days it dove more than 8% below the buy mark.In the process, it carved through its 50-day moving average in strong trade. But it also found firm support at its 200-day moving average 3.Buyers who got burned by the faulty breakout may have gone looking for other candidates into which to rotate cash. But Grainger proved it wasn't yet a goner.Let's say you've done your homework on the stock. If it has leadership-grade fundamentals, there's no harm in keeping an eye on it.A rebound from support at the 200-day line and a rise back through the prior base's 156.95 buy point put Grainger back in play.In the meantime, keep tabs on signs of heavy accumulation. Up days in higher volume and closes in the top half of the trading range suggest institutions may be quietly at work, picking up shares.Grainger closed at the top of its trading range for the first three days above 200-day support 4. Volume rose on the first and third days, too. Good signs. It retook the buy point Oct. 12 in mild volume. Not yet a buy.Grainger hovered for three days, then broke out Oct. 18 with a 7% gain in nearly double its average trade 5. It has since climbed 29%.

128,GWW,"We issued an updated research report on W.W. Grainger, Inc. (GWW  -  Free Report) on Jun 15. The company is expected to benefit from price deflation, continuous investments in e-commerce and digital capabilities, focus on strengthening large and mid-sized customers’ base as well as the latest tax reform. Upbeat Guidance Grainger expects sales growth of 5-8% and earnings per share between $14.30 and $15.30. It also anticipates operating earnings growth of 6-14% and EPS growth of 25-33% for the year. The guidance is backed by lower price headwind than previously expected. It is also aided by improved price mix and better currency translation. COGS deflation was way more favorable in the first quarter and the company expects it to continue this year. Grainger expects price mix to improve and 50 basis points of COGS deflation for the year, driven by its internal product cost initiatives. As a result of the U.S. tax reform,  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings for fiscal 2018 is pegged at $14.96, reflecting year-over-year growth of 30.54%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is at $11.17 billion, projecting year-over-year growth of 7.14%. Growth in E-commerce to Fuel Revenues Grainger’s e-commerce sales, representing around 53% of total sales in the first quarter, increased around 18% year over year. The increase can primarily be attributed to the launch of Grainger.com and other electronic purchasing platforms in the United States as well as across all single channel online businesses. The company is focused on improving the end-to-end customer experience by making investments in e-commerce and digital capabilities, and executing continuous improvement initiatives within its supply chain. Notably, it intends to continue reducing cost base. Improving Markets to Aid Growth Grainger generates revenues from the distribution of MRO (Maintenance, Repair and Operating) supplies and products and related services. In the United States, business investment and exports are two major indicators of MRO spending. Business investment is likely to remain strong in 2018, supported by expanding global markets, lower capital costs and an improving regulatory environment. Further, exports and business nonresidential investment are expected to improve. Further, Grainger will continue its efforts to strengthen relationships with both large and mid-sized customers. The company has been witnessing increasing volumes across all customer groups lately. Large customer volume in the United States increased 7% in the first quarter from the prior-year quarter and also surpassed management’s expectations. Mid-size customer volume also exceeded expectations with 30% growth in the quarter. Solid Estimate Revision, Price Performance Positive estimate revisions reflect optimism in the company's potential, as earnings growth is often an indication of robust prospects (and stock price gains) ahead. Estimates for Grainger for both 2018 and 2019 have moved up 5% and 4% respectively, in the past 60 days, reflecting analysts' bullish outlook.  Grainger’s shares have appreciated 78% in the past year, outperforming the industry’s rise of 47.9%.  Currently, Grainger sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. Other Stocks to Consider Some other top-ranked stocks in the sector include Axon Enterprise, Inc. (AAXN  -  Free Report), DMC Global Inc. (BOOM  -  Free Report) and Caterpillar Inc. (CAT  -  Free Report). All these stocks carry the same rank as Grainger.  Axon Enterprise has expected long-term growth rate of 25%.

129,GWW,"If you are still holding on to shares of Pentair plc (PNR  -  Free Report) in your portfolio, it is time you dump those as chances of favorable returns in the near term appear bleak. Pentair has witnessed a significant price decline in the year-to-date period owing to material and other cost inflation  as well as headwinds pertaining to the separation of the Electrical business. Similar to wise buying decisions, offloading certain underperformers at the right time helps maximize portfolio returns. Further, negative earnings estimate revisions for the current quarter and the fiscal indicate bleaks prospects for the company in near term. Further, the company’s Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) only reflects its innate weakness.  Shares of this diversified industrial manufacturing company have plunged approximately 38% year to date, faring worse than the industry’s decline of 12%. Let’s take a look at factors behind this dismal performance. Material Cost Inflation Persist The company has identified attractive opportunities in specific product and geographic markets, both within and outside the United States. The company is reinforcing its businesses to effectively address these opportunities through research & development as well as additional sales and marketing resources. Unless it is successful in its endeavors, the company’s sales growth is likely to be limited in the near term or may even decline. Further, Pentair continues to witness inflation in material and other costs. The current economic environment is likely to fuel the persisting price volatility for raw materials. Risks Pertaining to Electrical Business Separation Pentair's separation of the Electrical business will create two industry leading pure play companies in Water and Electrical — Pentair plc and nVent Electric plc (""nVent""), respectively. Although the separation will provide financial, operational, managerial and other benefits to the company as well as its shareholders, risks persist in connection with the separation. Moreover, Pentair will also incur certain costs and expenses relating to the spin-off. Those costs may exceed its estimates or could negate some of the expected benefits. If the intended benefits are not realized or costs exceed estimates, it would have an adverse effect on the financial condition. Further, each management team's inability to control additional stranded corporate costs or to deliver a smooth transition might affect near-term business performance. Foreign Currency Headwinds Sales outside the United States accounted for 40% of net sales in fiscal 2017. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, most notably the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the euro, could have an adverse material effect on the company’s revenues. Additionally, currency variations could have a negative material effect on margins on sales of products in countries outside the United States and margins on sales of products that include components obtained from suppliers located outside the country. Looking at the prevailing challenges and an unfavorable Zacks rank, it is wise to stay away from investing in Pentair stock right now. Some better-ranked stocks in the sector include Axon Enterprise, Inc. (AAXN  -  Free Report), DMC Global Inc. (BOOM  -  Free Report) and W.W. Grainger, Inc. (GWW  -  Free Report). All of these stocks carry sport Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. Axon Enterprise has expected long-term growth rate of 25%. Its shares have surged 167% in a year’s time. DMC Global has expected long-term growth rate of 20%. Its shares have appreciated 219% over the past year. Grainger has expected long-term growth rate of 12%.

131,GWW,"The U.S.-Canada trade dispute escalated after U.S. President Donald Trump called Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau “very dishonest and weak.” Trump had accused Canada of “charging massive tariffs” to U.S. businesses.The tiff involved France and Germany who criticized Trump’s decision to back out of the G7 communique. Trump, in the meanwhile, threatened to double auto tariffs, marring the G7 efforts to show a united front.   With Trump refusing to endorse the G7 communique, stock market gains are likely to be capped. In fact, more uncertainty is lurking as Trump is set to meet North Korean President Kim Jong Un in Singapore. Amid such ambiguity, investing in dividend aristocrats seems prudent, as they provide higher total returns with lower volatility.No Breakthrough at G7 SummitTrump’s stinging attack on Canada jeopardized the G7’s efforts to maintain free and fair trade relationships. He specifically accused Canada of imposing a 270% tariff on dairy. This has forced many U.S. dairy products from making their way to Canada from the United States. Trump, in return, has decided to slap more import tariffs on the sensitive auto industry.Trump tweeted “PM Justin Trudeau of Canada acted so meek and mild during our @G7 meetings only to give a news conference after I left saying that, ‘US Tariffs were kind of insulting’ and he ‘will not be pushed around.’ Very dishonest & weak. Our tariffs are in response to his of 270% on dairy!”Meanwhile, Trudeau’s office added that the dairy tariffs were primarily a reaction to Trump’s decision to levy charges on steel and aluminum imports from Canada, Mexico and the EU. Moreover, protective measures like Canada’s dairy tariff are very common throughout the world. Lest we forget, the United States has imposed tariffs to protect several of its industries, starting from the 350% tariff on tobacco to 160% on shelled peanuts.Trudeau said that Germany stood by the “jointly agreed communique” despite Trump’s decision to back out. France and Europe also continued to support the G7 communique and stated that anyone quitting the summit will be showing their “incoherence and inconsistency.”Historic Trump-Kim Summit, Central Bank MeetingsAmid the G7 trade spat, investors are keeping an eye on the much-talked-about meet between Trump and Kim in Singapore. The stakes are high as the summit marks the first time when both the leaders will meet in person to reach a denuclearization agreement on the Korean Peninsula.But, investors shouldn’t get their hopes up. Even if the meeting is successful, the stock market should brace for more gyrations as this week awaits outcome from central bank meetings.Time to Buy Dividend AristocratsSuch uncertainties make dividend paying stocks more attractive as they tend to outperform when the broader markets are facing gyrations. But, why dividend aristocrats? This is because this set of stocks outperforms other dividend payers on better quality business.This category of stocks reflects solid financial structure and healthy underlying fundamentals.

134,GWW,"The U.S. equity markets declined for the third straight session on Tuesday, pushed lower by the deteriorating political situation in Italy and its effect on global asset pricing.  The Dow jones Industrial Average lost nearly 400 points, the S&P 500 finished the day down 1.2% and many individual stocks fell even more.  Does widespread selling in U.S. equities (in response to a disruption that hasn’t actually affected us here yet) create an opportunity for investors to scoop up stock that have been undeservedly sold off?  Let’s take a look at the assets involved in Tuesday’s action to determine who might actually benefit.The announcement that Italy would hold a runoff election this fall that will include two affiliated far-right anti-euro parties roiled world markets. At stake is the possibility that Italy’s citizens could vote in a government that badly wants to leave the European Union. Investors heavily sold Italian bonds, with the yield on 2-year debt climbing to 2.73% from just 0.48% on Friday.  U.S. treasuries moved in the opposite direction, with buyers looking for safe haven and pushing the interest rate on 10-year treasuries down to 2.82%.  The U.S. dollar rallied against the Euro. Oil continued its recent slide, closing at the lowest level in 4 weeks.The prospect of economic turmoil in Europe is likely to keep the U.S. Federal Reserve acting more conservatively in raising short term interest rates for fear of over-shooting and stifling growth.Broad selling of equities in Europe spread to the U.S. markets and many stocks with little to no Italian exposure declined sharply on the day.Giant U.S. SupplierWW Grainger (GWW  -  Free Report) is the largest U.S. supplier of industrial-grade supplies and safety products.  Its products – everything from janitorial supplies to tools and parts to industrial equipment - is delivered to businesses of all sizes though its own extensive distribution network.  Grainger is coming off a string of earnings beats, most recently posting $4.18/share in Q1, considerably higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.41/share. Full year 2018 earnings are now expected to be $14.90/share, 30% higher than 2017. GWW is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Grainger shares declined $6.90 or over 2% on Tuesday in the broad market selloff, though because it derives over 80% of revenues in the U.S. and Canada, it is relatively immune to the Italian problems and the stronger dollar. Low interest rates and fuel costs will actually help the company rather than hurting it.  Tuesday’s price action makes the stock an even better buy than before.Banking on VolatilityGoldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report) was battered along with the rest of the financial sector, declining $7.98, a whopping 3.4%.  Fears of an economic crisis in Italy and the possibility of serious recession there had investors scrambling to dump shares of international financial institutions with potential exposure.In reality, the chances of Italy actually leaving the European Union are still so low that this reaction is likely overdone. Investors learned a costly lesson about the inter-connectedness of large financial institutions during the crisis of 2008-2009 and are now hyper-sensitive to the possibility of cascading effects of asset repricing.In reality, Goldman Sachs tends to earn more during periods of market volatility.  Their core trading businesses are likely to benefit from European uncertainty.Regional Banks PunishedIn the rush to sell bank stocks, smaller regional banks declined along with giant multi-nationals, even though the regional banks have little to no exposure to Italian assets.In reality, it’s an excellent environment for these institutions as congress voted last week to repeal some of the more onerous conditions of the Dodd-Frank bill as they apply to smaller institutions.Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB  -  Free Report) has been a strong performer lately, coming off 16 consecutive quarters of exceeding earnings estimates, but the stock is more than 12% off its all-time highs – set earlier this month – including a 3% decline on Tuesday.  With increasing revenues, steadily improving credit quality and a strong capital position, FITB is expected to earn $2.46/share in 2018.  Thirteen analyst upgrades in the past 60 days earn Fifth Third a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).  The recent price decline has Fifth Third trading at a forward P/E ratio of just 13X, and is an opportunity to buy a very strong performer at a discount price.

135,GWW,"On May 28, we issued an updated research report on Milacron Holdings Corp. (MCRN  -  Free Report). The company is poised to gain from new order books, expansion in emerging markets, as well as cost-reduction initiatives. However, input cost inflation is expected to affect results.Let’s illustrate these growth factors in detail.Milacron to Gain From Expansion in Emerging MarketsDemand for a diverse range of finished plastic products has been on the rise in many markets, including automotive, construction and consumer products. This is being escalated by global population growth, along with sustained urbanization, increased purchasing power and improved lifestyle in emerging markets. Given its strong global presence, Milacron is well positioned to capture a portion of this growth.The company has made significant investments in China and India, considering the projected growth rates of plastic business in these markets. Milacron plans to continue to expand its manufacturing capabilities, while also improving the company’s technical, marketing and sales efforts. The company also continues to strategically reorganize its manufacturing base in order to shift resources to high-growth geographic markets.New Order Books to Boost Top LineMilacron will display its latest product offerings in the NPE trade show this year. The company will display new Mold-Masters sequential electric valve gates, the Fusion G2 hot runner system for large parts, as well as Milacron's M Powered IoT and aftermarket solutions. The company will also exhibit its new Cincinnati large tonnage machine. There will be many other product displays in the equipment and consumables segments of business. This level of product launch will support Milacron’s vitality index goal of 20% and also add to new order books.Cost-Reduction Initiatives to Stoke GrowthMilacron expects that its profitability will be supported by revenue growth and margin expansion in the near term. Over the past three years, the company has undertaken a number of organizational redesign and cost-reduction initiatives. The key actions include realigning the overall cost structure, consolidating sales offices and call centers, along with optimizing the manufacturing footprint. Milacron’s organizational redesign and cost-reduction efforts are in the process of being implemented and are expected to yield approximately $35 million of annual run-rate cost savings by the end of 2018.Input Cost inflation to Impede ProfitImposition of tariffs on steel prices will pull down Milacron’s margin with a $3-million headwind, principally in the Advanced Plastic Processing Technologies segment. Thus, input cost inflation, particularly steel, will continue to be a headwind and dampen margins in 2018.Share Price PerformanceMilacron has outperformed its industry with respect to price performance over the past year. The stock has gained around 16% compared with 13% growth recorded by the industry during the same time frame.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderMilacron currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the same sector are Axon Enterprise, Inc (AAXN  -  Free Report), Caterpillar Inc.

137,GWW,"Pentair plc (PNR  -  Free Report) is no more in investors' good books as evident from the recent fall in its estimates and negative growth projections. Material and other cost inflation along with headwinds pertaining to the separation of the Electrical business have largely weighed down the stock.  Pentair has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), which indicates possibilities of underperformance in the near term. Stock Continues to Decline  Shares of Pentair have declined around 31.9% in the past month, significantly wider than the industry’s fall of 5.9%. Estimates Decline In the last 30 days, five estimates for fiscal 2018 and four estimates for fiscal 2019 have been revised downward versus no upward estimate revisions. This indicates analysts’ pessimism regarding the stock. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share for fiscal 2018 plunged 40% to $2.28 and for fiscal 2019 has declined 39% to $2.46. Near-Term Headwinds to Revenues, Margins The company has identified attractive opportunities in specific product and geographic markets, both within and outside the United States. The company is reinforcing its businesses to effectively address these opportunities through research & development as well as additional sales and marketing resources. Unless it is successful in its endeavors, the company’s sales growth is likely to be limited in the near term or may decline. Pentair continues to witness inflation in material and other costs. The current economic environment is likely to fuel the persisting price volatility for raw materials. For fiscal 2018, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $2.28, reflecting a year-over-year decline of 35.41%. Revenues are projected at $2.96 billion, a year-over-year dip of 40%. Risks Pertaining to Separation of Electrical Business Pentair's separation of the Electrical business will create two industry leading pure play companies in Water and Electrical — Pentair plc and nVent Electric plc (""nVent""), respectively. Although the separation will provide financial, operational, managerial and other benefits to the company as well as its shareholders, risks persist in connection with the separation. Also, Pentair will also incur certain costs and expenses relating to the spin-off. Those costs may exceed its estimates or could negate some of the expected benefits. If the intended benefits are not realized or costs exceed estimates, it would have an adverse effect on the financial condition. Further, each management team's inability to control additional stranded corporate costs or to deliver a smooth transition might affect near-term business performance. Forget Pentair, Check These Industrial Stocks That Witnessed Positive Estimate Revisions Caterpillar Inc.’s (CAT  -  Free Report) earnings estimates for full-year 2018 have increased by 15% to $10.58 per share in the last 30 days while estimates for 2019 rose 13% to $11.91 per share.

138,GWW,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for W.W. Grainger, Inc. (GWW  -  Free Report). Shares have added about 2.3% in that time frame.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is GWW due for a pullback?

This was driven by an increase of 8 percentage point (pp) in volume growth, 2 pp in foreign exchange and 1 pp in sales of seasonal products, partially offset by a decline of 1 pp in price and 1 pp owing to the divestiture of a specialty business.Revenues also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,708 million. There were 64 selling days in the reported quarter, same as in first-quarter 2017.Grainger’s stellar first-quarter performance was backed by strong volumes in its U.S. business, driven by an improving demand environment.

The 6% decline was due to a 13-pp decline in volumes, partially offset by 7 pp of higher prices. Revenues from Other businesses (which include Asia, Europe and Latin America) climbed 18% year over year to $588 million, primarily driven by a 24% sales growth in single-channel online business.Financial PositionGrainger had cash and cash equivalents of $302 million at the end of first-quarter 2018 compared with $326.9 million at 2017-end. Cash provided by operating activities decreased to $146.9 million in the first quarter from $180.9 million in the prior-year quarter.Long-term debt was $2.24 billion as of Mar 31, 2018, compared with $2.25 billion as of Dec 31, 2017.

139,GWW,"Shares of W.W. Grainger Inc. (GWW  -  Free Report) have soared around 77% in the last year. The company has also outperformed its industry’s growth of roughly 37% as well as S&P 500's gain of 11%. Grainger has a market capitalization of roughly $17.2 billion. Average volume of shares traded in the last three months is around 813k. The company has topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 18.7%. Let’s take a look into the factors that are driving this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.  Driving Factors Strong Q1: Grainger’s first-quarter 2018 adjusted earnings per share of $4.18 rose around 45% year over year. Further, earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.41 by 23%. Upbeat Outlook: Grainger raised sales and earnings per share guidance for 2018. The company now anticipates sales growth of 5-8% compared with the prior guidance of 3-7%. Further, the outlook for earnings per share has been lifted to $14.30-$15.30 from $12.95-$14.15. It also expects operating earnings growth of 6-14% and EPS growth of 25-33% for the year.  The guidance is backed by lower price headwind than previously expected and improved price mix along with better currency translation. COGS deflation was way more favorable in the first quarter and the company expects it to continue this year. Grainger expects price mix to improve and 50 basis points of COGS deflation for the year, driven by its internal product cost initiatives. As a result of the U.S. tax reform, Grainger expects its corporate tax rate at the mid-point to drop to 24.5% from 36% in 2018, which will benefit EPS by $2.15 in 2018. Rising Business Investment: Grainger generates revenues from the distribution of MRO (Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul) supplies and products and related services. In the United States, business investment and exports are two major indicators of MRO spending. Business investment is likely to remain strong in 2018, supported by expanding global markets, lower capital costs and an improving regulatory environment. Further, exports and business nonresidential investment are expected to improve. Growth in E-Commerce: Grainger’s e-commerce sales, which represent around 53% of total sales in the first quarter, increased around 18% year over year. The increase was primarily buoyed by the launch of Grainger.com and other electronic purchasing platforms in the United States and across all single channel online businesses. The company is focused on improving the end-to-end customer experience by making investments in its e-commerce and digital capabilities and executing continuous improvement initiatives within its supply chain. Notably, it intends to continue to reduce cost base. Estimates Moving North: Positive estimate revisions reflect optimism in the company's potential, as earnings growth is often an indication of robust prospects (and stock price gains) ahead. Estimates for Grainger for both 2018 and 2019 have moved up 7% and 4% respectively, in the past 30 days, reflecting analysts' bullish outlook. Stocks to Consider Some other top-ranked stocks in the sector include Caterpillar Inc. (CAT  -  Free Report), Terex Corporation (TEX  -  Free Report) and H&E Equipment Services, Inc. (HEES  -  Free Report). All these stocks carry the same rank as Grainger.  Caterpillar has expected long-term growth rate of 13.3%. Its shares have appreciated 53% over the past year. Terex has expected long-term growth rate of 20.2%. Its shares have gone up 32% in a year’s time. H&E Equipment Services has expected long-term growth rate of 17.4%.

140,GWW,"Deere & Company (DE  -  Free Report) has been witnessing upward revisions for the past 30 days. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has inched up 0.8% to $9.66 for fiscal 2018 and 1% to $11.54 for fiscal 2019. A positive trend in estimate revisions reflects investors’ optimism over the company’s bright prospects.Deere also outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three out of the trailing four quarters, delivering a positive average earnings surprise of 4.21%.However, the agricultural equipment maker, with a market capitalization of approximately $51.5 billion, has been plagued with challenges in its agriculture business and elevated expenses.Below, we briefly discuss the company’s potential growth drivers and possible headwinds.Factors Favoring DeerePrice PerformanceShares of the company have outperformed the industry in a year’s time. The stock has gained around 30% compared with 26% growth recorded by the industry during the period.Return on Assets (ROA)Deere, currently, has a ROA of nearly 4%, while the industry's ROA is 3.7%. An above-average ROA denotes that the company is generating earnings by effectively managing assets.Return on Equity (ROE)Deere’s trailing 12-month ROE of 27.7% reinforces its growth potential. The company’s ROE is higher than the ROE of 25.4% for the industry, highlighting the company’s tactical efficiency in using shareholders’ funds.Growth Drivers in PlaceDeere is well poised to gain from the Wirtgen acquisition which significantly enhances the exposure of the former to global transportation infrastructure. Notably, the Wirtgen integration is right on track, with the Deere-Wirtgen team working toward the synergy target of EUR 100 million by 2022. For fiscal 2018, Wirtgen is expected to add $3.2 billion in revenues. Additionally, Deere now projects that Wirtgen will contribute $100 million in operating profit for the fiscal. Deere expects that Wirtgen’s operating margins will be 13-14% beyond fiscal 2018.Further, Deere’s performance will be driven by global economic growth, including higher housing starts in the United States, and an improved oil and gas sector. Again, economic environment for the construction, forestry and road building industries bodes well, and it continues to spur demand for new and used equipment. As the United States has put a hold on the tariffs on Chinese goods, it will be beneficial for Deere. The company would have been, otherwise, negatively impacted by the slump in domestic demand due to China's retaliatory tariffs and the ban of U.S. agricultural products.HeadwindsDeere’s agriculture business is feared to be affected in fiscal 2018 by expectations of high global grain and oil seed stocks-to-use ratios. This is because abundant crops have offset demand around the world. Furthermore, corn, soybeans and stock-to-use ratios are expected to decline, in response to the rising global demand and drought conditions in Argentina, which have lowered the country's corn and soybean production by roughly 25% and 33%, respectively.Moreover, Deere will bear the brunt of elevated expenses in fiscal 2018. Its guidance for cost of sales as a percent of net sales is about 76% for the fiscal, up 1% from the previous guidance. The company believes an unfavorable product mix, elevated overhead spending and increased incentive compensation will escalate the cost of sales guidance.Bottom LineInvestors might want to hold on to the stock, at present, as it has ample prospects of outperforming peers in the near future.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderDeere currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the same sector are Axon Enterprise, Inc (AAXN  -  Free Report), Caterpillar Inc. (CAT  -  Free Report) and W.W. Grainger, Inc. (GWW  -  Free Report). All three stocks sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

141,GWW,"Shares of Armstrong World Industries, Inc. (AWI  -  Free Report) have surged around 47% in the last year. The company has also outperformed its industry’s growth of roughly 19% as well as S&P 500's gain of 13%. The price surge can be attributed to strong repair and remodel activity along with the continued positive new building construction activity. Further, productivity improvements in plants and focus on restructuring activities bode well for the company. Armstrong World has a market capitalization of roughly $3.1 billion. Average volume of shares traded in the last three months is around 423k. Let’s take a look into the factors that are driving this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock.  Driving Factors Strong Q1: Armstrong World delivered adjusted earnings of 79 cents per share in first-quarter 2018 compared with 74 cents reported in the prior-year quarter. Net sales increased 3% year over year to $227 million, driven by higher Architectural Specialties volumes and higher Mineral Fiber AUV (average unit value). Upbeat Outlook: For 2018, the company maintained net sales growth in the range of 5-7% aided by a modest upturn in volume, AUV improvement in Mineral Fiber segment and continued double-digit sales gains in the Architectural Specialties segment. It anticipates EBITDA improvement of more than 10% for the year, on the back of sales gain, productivity improvements in plants and impact of announced restructuring activities. The company raised EPS guidance to a range of $3.60-$3.82, reflecting year-over-year growth of 19-27%. The guidance hike is a result of $70 million of share repurchases in the first quarter, which reduced outstanding share count to 52 million from 53 million previously..Construction Activity, Investment in Products to Drive Results: The company’s results will be aided by strong repair and remodel activity, as well as the continuation of positive new building construction activity. Since its separation from the flooring business in 2016, Armstrong World has been strategically investing in new products, sales and support services, and advanced manufacturing capabilities. In January 2017, the company concluded the purchase of Tectum, which accelerated its penetration into specialty ceilings and walls. Now having fully integrated the business, it can begin making modest capital investments to further enhance capabilities and profitability in this product line. Moreover, continued sales leverage and capital investments at Tectum will enable its Architectural Specialty business to expand margins in 2018 and beyond. Estimates Moving North: Positive estimate revisions reflect optimism in the company's potential, as earnings growth is often an indication of robust prospects (and stock price gains) ahead. In the past 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 and 2019 moved up 6% and 2% to $3.70 and $4.28, respectively. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 projects year-over-year growth of 22.5%. For 2019, earnings are expected to improve 15.6% year over year. The company has an estimated long-term earnings growth rate of 17.3%. Stocks to Consider Some better-ranked stocks in the same sector include Caterpillar Inc.

However, implementation costs related to business-transformation plan as well as elevated raw material costs are anticipated to hurt AptarGroup's performance. Let’s analyze these growth factors in detail. Focus on Strategies to Prove Beneficial The company projects earnings per share for second-quarter 2018 in the range of 99 cents to $1.04. It expects each segment to report elevated second-quarter revenues over the prior year. AptarGroup expects each segment to report elevated second-quarter revenues over the prior year. The outlook is backed by its focus on strategies, including transformation activities in the Beauty + Home segment and select G&A functions. Business-Transformation Plan to Fuel Growth In late 2017, AptarGroup began a business-transformation plan in a bid to become a more agile, competitive and customer-centric business. This plan includes a wide range of initiatives to drive sales growth, enhance operational excellence as well as improve organizational health and effectiveness. The company is poised to gain from its focus on the plan which will yield annual recurring incremental EBITDA of approximately $80 million by the end of 2020. Pharma Business Remains a Tailwind AptarGroup’s Pharma segment will continue to improve on solid underlying fundamentals in most regions and end markets and drug delivery innovation. The company is experiencing continued adoption of its products for nasal spray systems (metered dose inhalers), injectable products and the ophthalmic market. Demand for decongestant applications is also on the rise. The company has invested in additional capacity at Congers, NY facility to better serve U.S. customers in the injectables market. Higher Cost to Impair Near-term Margins AptarGroup expects to incur implementation costs of approximately $90 million over the next three years related to business-transformation plan in the Beauty + Home segment. It also anticipates capital investments related to the transformation plan of about $45 million, majority of which will be incurred in 2018. These costs remain a drag for earnings in the near term. Also, elevated raw material costs are expected to affect near-term margins. Share Price Performance  AptarGroup has outperformed its industry with respect to price performance over the past year. The stock has gained around 12%, while the industry has recorded growth of 6%. Zacks Rank & Stocks to Consider AptarGroup currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked stocks in the same sector include Caterpillar Inc.

143,GWW,"TriMas Corporation (TRS  -  Free Report) remains well poised for growth driven by its focus on leveraging the TriMas Business Model, segment restructuring and a strong pipeline of both product as well as process innovation. A positive trend in estimate revisions also reflects optimism over the company's prospects. However, the Aerospace segment’s revenue growth will be dented by TriMas' decision to exit up to $4 million of less profitable business, primarily in the machine components product line. Further, resin pressure will impact Packaging segment’s margins. The maker of engineered and applied products, with a market capitalization of approximately $1.33 billion, carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). The stock has an estimated long-term earnings growth rate of 5%. Let’s delve deeper and discuss the company's potential growth drivers and possible headwinds.  Factors Favoring TriMas Northbound Estimates Over the past 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings for fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019 have both moved up 2%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings for fiscal 2018 is at $1.68 projecting year-over-year growth of 20%. For fiscal 2018, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is expected to climb 7.84% to $1.81. Value Growth Momentum (VGM) Score TriMas currently has a Zacks VGM Score of B. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum. Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners. The VGM Score of B, along with some other key metrics, makes the company a solid choice for investors. Positive Earnings Surprise History The company has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the last four quarters, with an average beat of 3.97%. Price Performance  TriMas has outperformed its industry with respect to price performance over the past year. The stock has appreciated around 32% while the industry has dipped 1.7%. Long-Term Growth Drivers in Place The company will continue to focus on leveraging the TriMas Business Model to drive performance which will fuel long-term growth. Its innovative solutions through product, process or service, as well as extensive resources will help enhance business performance. The company also has a strong pipeline of both product and process innovation that will sustain long-term growth and poise it well to capitalize on market opportunities as well as minimize market disruptions. Near-Term Issues to Dent Segment Performance In the Specialty Products segment, the Lamons business witnessed higher sales in the first quarter stemming from sales of specialty seals and gaskets used by refineries in their annual maintenance, much of which was deferred from last fall due to the impact of hurricanes in the United States. Further, to take advantage of strong energy prices, many refineries pulled forward their typical spring maintenance which is a common occurrence when the companies shift over from producing heating oil to gasoline for the summer months. Moreover, Norris Cylinder witnessed a strong order intake in the first quarter, which seems to have been triggered by customers ordering ahead of potential impacts of steel tariffs. So it remains uncertain whether the order flow witnessed in the first quarter in the segment is likely to continue or not. The packaging segment, the company’s most profitable business, should benefit from new products and realignment of the segment’s manufacturing footprint. It continues to witness robust quoting activity within its existing and new product lines. However, margins will likely be affected by resin pricing pressure as well as the near-term impact from capacity additions, and continued investments for sales and technical resources, including new products. In an effort to streamline operations and improve margins in the Aerospace segment, TriMas is exiting up to $4 million of less profitable business, primarily in the machine components product line. Though this will help improve the long-term profitability of this business, it will dent revenue growth for the year. Stocks to Consider Caterpillar Inc.’s (CAT  -  Free Report) earnings estimates for full-year 2018 have increased by 15% to $10.58 per share in the last 30 days while estimates for 2019 rose 13% to $11.91 per share. The company currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Its shares have gone up 51% over the past year. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Axon Enterprise, Inc. (AAXN  -  Free Report) also witnessed positive estimates revisions for fiscal 2018 and 2019. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2018 has soared 100% to 82 cents per share in the last 30 days while estimates for fiscal 2019 climbed by 53% to $1.04 per share. The company currently flaunts a Zacks Rank #1. Its shares have soared 148% over the past year. Both the fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019 consensus for W.W. Grainger, Inc. (GWW  -  Free Report) have moved up 2% to $14.90 per share and $16.79 per share, respectively, in the last 30 days. The company carries a Zacks Rank #1. Its shares have surged 73% in the past year. The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of All Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early. See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

146,GWW,"Designed to provide broad exposure to the Industrials ETFs category of the U.S. equity market, the Guggenheim S&P 500 Equal Weight Industrials ETF (RGI  -  Free Report) is a smart beta exchange traded fund launched on 11/01/2006.What Are Smart Beta ETFs?Market cap weighted indexes were created to reflect the market, or a specific segment of the market, and the ETF industry has traditionally been dominated by products based on this strategy.Because market cap weighted indexes provide a low-cost, convenient, and transparent way of replicating market returns, they work well for investors who believe in market efficiency.There are some investors, though, who think it's possible to beat the market with great stock selection; this group likely invests in another class of funds known as smart beta, which track non-cap weighted strategies.Non-cap weighted indexes try to choose stocks that have a better chance of risk-return performance, which is based on specific fundamental characteristics, or a mix of other such characteristics.While this space offers a number of choices to investors, including simplest equal-weighting, fundamental weighting and volatility/momentum based weighting methodologies, not all these strategies have been able to deliver superior results.Fund Sponsor & IndexBecause the fund has amassed over $307.48 M, this makes it one of the average sized ETFs in the Industrials ETFs. RGI is managed by Invesco Powershares. RGI seeks to match the performance of the S&P 500 Equal Weight Industrials Index before fees and expenses.This index is an unmanaged equal weighted version of the S&P 500 Industrials Index that consists of the common stocks of the following industries: aerospace & defense, building products, construction & engineering, electrical equipment, conglomerates, machinery; commercial services & supplies, air freight & logistics, airlines, marine, road & rail transportation infrastructure.Cost & Other ExpensesExpense ratios are an important factor in the return of an ETF and in the long-term, cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive cousins, other things remaining the same.Operating expenses on an annual basis are 0.40% for this ETF, which makes it on par with most peer products in the space.RGI's 12-month trailing dividend yield is 1.17%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsIt is important to delve into an ETF's holdings before investing despite the many upsides to these kinds of funds like diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk. And, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.Representing 100% of the portfolio, the fund has heaviest allocation to the Industrials sector.Taking into account individual holdings, Transdigm Group Inc (TDG  -  Free Report) accounts for about 1.57% of the fund's total assets, followed by Ww Grainger Inc (GWW  -  Free Report) and Harris Corp (HRS  -  Free Report).RGI's top 10 holdings account for about 15.26% of its total assets under management.Performance and RiskRGI has added roughly 0.21% so far this year, and as of 04/18/2018, is up about 18.09% in the last one year. In the past 52-week period, the fund has traded between $102.86 and $127.83.RGI has a beta of 1.09 and standard deviation of 14.80% for the trailing three-year period, which makes the fund a medium choice in the space. With about 70 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.AlternativesGuggenheim S&P 500 Equal Weight Industrials ETF is an excellent option for investors seeking to outperform the Industrials ETFs segment of the market. There are other ETFs in the space which investors could consider as well.Vanguard Industrials ETF (VIS  -  Free Report) tracks MSCI US Investable Market Industrials 25/50 Index and the Industrial Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLI  -  Free Report) tracks Industrial Select Sector Index. Vanguard Industrials ETF has $3.80 B in assets, Industrial Select Sector SPDR Fund has $12.79 B. VIS has an expense ratio of 0.10% and XLI charges 0.13%.Investors looking for cheaper and lower-risk options should consider traditional market cap weighted ETFs that aim to match the returns of the Industrials ETFs.Bottom LineTo learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.

A positive trend in estimate revisions reflects investors’ optimism over the company’s bright prospects. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter reflects year-over-year growth of 40% and for fiscal 2018, the estimate projects growth of 44.6% over the prior year. Deere has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and a VGM Score of A. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum. Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners. The VGM Score of A, along with some other key metrics, makes the company a solid choice for investors. Below, we briefly discuss the company’s potential growth drivers. Surprise History: Deere also outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, delivering a positive average earnings surprise of 4.21%. Price Performance: Shares of the company have outperformed the industry in a year’s time. The stock has gained around 19% compared with 12% growth recorded by the industry.  Return on Assets (ROA): Deere, currently, has a ROA of nearly 4%, while the industry's ROA is 3.7%. An above-average ROA denotes that the company is generating earnings by effectively managing assets. Return on Equity (ROE): Deere’s trailing 12-month ROE of 27.7% reinforces its growth potential. The company’s ROE is higher than the ROE of 25.4% for the industry, highlighting the company’s tactical efficiency in using shareholders’ funds. Growth Drivers in Place: Deere’s results will be driven by replacement demand in the agricultural sector and improvement in construction activity. The company is well poised to gain from the Wirtgen acquisition which significantly enhances the exposure of the former to global transportation infrastructure. For fiscal 2018, Wirtgen is expected to add $3.2 billion in revenues. Deere anticipates Wirtgen’s operating margins to be 13-14% beyond fiscal 2018. Deere’s growth will be driven by improved operational performance due to disciplined cost management, and continued investment in innovative technology and solutions. Bottom Line Investors might want to hold on to the stock, at present, as it has ample prospects of outperforming peers in the near future. Zacks Rank & Stocks to Consider Some better-ranked stocks in the same sector are Axon Enterprise, Inc (AAXN  -  Free Report), Caterpillar Inc. (CAT  -  Free Report) and W.W. Grainger, Inc. (GWW  -  Free Report). All three stocks sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge. With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.

149,GWW,"Have you been paying attention to shares of W.W. Grainger (GWW  -  Free Report)? Shares have been on the move with the stock up 7% over the past month. GWW hit a new 52-week high of $309.80 in the previous session. W.W. Grainger has gained 26.9% since the start of the year compared to the -4.4% move for the Industrial Products sector and the 8.7% year-to-date return for its peer group.What's Driving the Outperformance?The stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises, having beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on April 19, 2018, W.W. Grainger reported EPS of $4.18 versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.41 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 2.13%.For the current fiscal year, W.W. Grainger is expected to post earnings of $13.81 per share on $10.94 billion in revenues. This represents a 20.51% change in EPS on a 4.9% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $15.87 per share on $11.69 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 14.94% and 6.9%, respectively.Valuation MetricsW.W. Grainger may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for GWW? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.W.W. Grainger has a Value Score of C. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are A and A, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of B.In terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 21.7X current fiscal year EPS estimates. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 18.1X versus its peer group's average of 11.6X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 2.24. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.W.W. Grainger, Inc. Price and Consensus  W.W. Grainger, Inc. Price and Consensus | W.W. Grainger, Inc. QuoteZacks RankWe also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, W.W. Grainger currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if W.W. Grainger fits the bill. Thus, it seems as though GWW shares could still be poised for more gains ahead.How Does W.W. Grainger Stack Up to the Competition?Shares of W.W. Grainger have been moving higher, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? Some of its industry peers are also impressive, including DMC Global (BOOM  -  Free Report), HD Supply Holdings (HDS  -  Free Report), and Ashtead Group PLC (ASHTY  -  Free Report), all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least #2 and a VGM Score of at least B, making them well-rounded choices.The Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 15% of all the industries we have in our universe, so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for GWW, even beyond its own solid fundamental situation.

150,GWW,"Considering how many game-changing headlines we’ve seen so far in 2018 — from inflation/interest rate fears to geopolitical hornets nests to Washington DC soap operas — this has been a welcome week for the stock markets. Just think if we’d have had some seasonably appropriate weather — we’d be on Cloud 9 right now! And this relative calm in a sea of turbulence continues ahead of the opening bell this morning, with Initial Jobless Claims and new Q1 earnings results hitting the tape.Initial Jobless Claims remained steady at 232K last week, 1000 claims fewer than the previous week and remaining solidly within the long-term range of 225K-250K which is illustrative of a very strong (and continually tightening) labor market. Aside from dips below even these very robust figures a month or so ago, and spikes into higher jobless claims territory for a short time following last summer’s massive hurricanes, we have enjoyed an historically strong and steady U.S. employment situation for several years now. Continuing claims reached 1.863 million in the week, another very healthy sign.Q1 earnings results continue strong and steady, as well. While we’re not seeing any of the biggest companies on Wall Street reporting today, such as the FANG stocks (most of which start next week; Netflix posted positive surprises Monday), we do have a number of companies that have registered new figures, and almost all better than expected:Zacks Rank #2 (Buy)-rated W.W. Grainger (GWW  -  Free Report) posted a heft earnings beat, reporting $4.18 per share vs. $3.41 expected. Revenues also surpassed expectations, $2.77 billion vs. $2.71 billion in the Zacks consensus. The company also raised sales guidance for full-year 2018 from 3-7% previously to 5-8% today, to $14.30-15.30 per share. Shares, as a result, are trading up 7% in today’s pre-market. For more on GWW’s earnings, click here.Two Wall Street banks have also brought forth Q1 results: BB&T (BBT  -  Free Report) and Bank of New York-Mellon (BK  -  Free Report). Both Zacks Rank #3 (Hold)-rated firms beat on both top and bottom lines, with BK posting the wider positive margins: $1.10 per share on $4.18 billion, ahead of the 97 cents and $4.05 billion anticipated, up 33% and 9% year over year, respectively. BBT beat by 5 cents on the bottom line to 97 cents per share on revenues that eked out expectations of $2.83 billion.For more on BBT’s earnings, click here.For more on BK’s earnings, click here.Among still others, tobacco major Philip Morris (PM  -  Free Report) topped earnings estimates by posting an even $1.00 per share in the quarter, above the 88 cents expected and representing growth of 2% year over year. Yet revenues of $6,896 million fell beneath the Zacks consensus of $7,024 million, although year over year was still up 13.7%. Guidance is for full-year growth of 8-11%, higher.

151,GWW,"The Q1 earnings season has kicked off on an impressive note, with total earnings for the 24 S&P 500 members that have released results so far, surging 39.3% year over year on 11.7% higher revenues, per the latest Earnings Trends report. Notably, overall earnings for all the S&P 500 companies are expected to be up 16.6% on 7.5% growth in revenues this season, highlighting the highest quarterly earnings growth rate in the last seven years.Industrial Sector on Growth PathThe Industrial Products sector, currently placed at the top 6% out of the 16 Zacks sectors, is one of the sectors which are expected to record double-digit earnings growth, mainly driven by the U.S. tax reform. According to our latest numbers, the sector’s earnings are on track to be up 24.1% in the quarter compared with last year.The Industrial Products sector, which was affected by soft commodity prices, reduced investment in the energy sector, dismal economic conditions in some developed and developing nations in the last few years, regained its ground last year. The turnaround in its performance is chiefly backed by increased infrastructure spending and other growth-friendly policies of the new administration. Rise in manufacturing and mining activity also played a crucial role.Driving Factors for the Sector in Q1Industrial production is one of the leading economic indicators for industrial stocks. U.S. industrial production inched up 0.5% in March. Further, U.S. housing starts rose 1.9% in the month led by rebound in construction of multi-family housing units.Also, the U.S Architecture Billings Index (ABI), an economic indicator that provides an approximately nine-to-12 month glimpse into the future of non-residential construction spending activity, was 52 in February. Any score more than 50 indicates billings growth and reflects a healthy business environment.However, the latest report of the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) stated that the Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) edged down 1.5% to 59.3% in March from February. This indicates the likely surge in raw material costs, as well as fear among manufacturers about the impact of steel and aluminum import tariffs imposed by Trump last month. U.S.-China trade tensions haven't allayed as Trump seeks an added tariff of $100 billion on China products in addition to the already-proposed $50 billion.It will be interesting to see how some of the industrial stocks fare when the companies release first-quarter 2018 numbers on Apr 19.Our PicksW.W.

Grainger, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  W.W. Grainger, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | W.W. Grainger, Inc. QuoteKey Factors to ConsiderIn the first quarter, Grainger is expected to benefit from pricing initiatives, digital marketing strategies and efforts to bring its Canadian business back to profitability. Further, the first-quarter margins remain typically higher due to price increase cycles. However, elevated expenses and fluctuation in oil and gas prices are likely to affect results.Notably, the company is in the middle of a substantial transformation of the Canada business. Its focus on improving the business’ cost structure through branch reductions, improving service to customers and the creation of North American centers of excellence will drive results. Per the Zacks Consensus Estimates, net sales in the Canada segment are likely to rise around 2% to $190 million in the first quarter. Moreover, the segment will likely report an adjusted operating loss of $15 million, narrower than the operating loss of $15.6 million witnessed in first-quarter 2017.Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Grainger’s quarterly sales in the Unites States is $2.07 billion, reflecting around 5.9% year over year rise.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for adjusted operating income of the segment is pegged at $307 million in the first quarter compared to $306 million reported in the prior-year quarter. Focus on pricing strategies, volume growth and an improving demand environment remain catalysts for the segment’s performance in the quarter to be reported.Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Grainger’s earnings per share is pegged at $3.39 for the first quarter, reflecting year-over-year growth of 17.7%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total sales of $2.71 billion also indicates nearly 6.6% increase from the prior-year quarter.In addition, Grainger’s price performance has been impressive over the past year.

153,GWW,"We believe that HD Supply Holdings, Inc. (HDS  -  Free Report) is a solid choice for investors who are seeking exposure in the industrial services space. Healthy end markets for both the segments, benefits from acquired assets and gains from divestment will be advantageous for the company.The stock, with roughly $7.1 billion market capitalization, was upgraded to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) on Apr 7. Its investment appeal is further accentuated by a VGM Score of B.HD Supply delivered better-than-expected results in two of the last four quarters while lagging estimates in one and delivering in-line results in one. Average earnings surprise was a positive 3.74%. Notably, its shares rallied 3.2% in the last month, outperforming 1% gain of the industry. Why the Upgrade?We are providing a snapshot of how HD Supply fared in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 (ended Jan 28, 2018). Its earnings of 49 cents surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 11.36%. Net sales were up 9% year over year on the back of healthy segmental performance of the Facilities Maintenance and Construction & Industrial segments.A number of initiatives taken in fiscal 2017 will be fruitful for HD Supply in the current fiscal and so on. In this regard, investments directed toward the enhancement of selling channels in the Facilities Maintenance segment, as well as the opening of four new branches in key districts in the Construction & Industrial segment, are worth mentioning. Also, the company anticipates mid-single-digit growth in the residential construction market and low- to mid-single-digit growth in the non-residential market to boost the Construction & Industrial segment in fiscal 2018 while an approximate 1-2% growth in “Living Space” MRO will prove advantageous for the Facilities Maintenance segment.In fiscal 2018, HD Supply anticipates approximately 2-3% year-over-year growth in its end markets. Net sales will likely increase 14% to $5,760-$5,910 million. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBIDTA) will be within $815-$855 million, reflecting growth of 14% at the midpoint. Adjusted earnings are predicted to be $2.99-$3.21 per share, representing mid-point growth of 34%. Through Mar 12, 2018, the company is left to buy back roughly $445 million shares under its $1 billion program authorized in fiscal 2017.Moreover, HD Supply’s focus on expanding its operations through meaningful buyouts will work in its favor. In March 2018, it completed the acquisition of A.H. Harris Construction Supplies. This buyout compliments the Construction & Industrial segment’s White Cap business and will expand its product offerings and customer base in the Atlantic regions, especially mid, south and northeast. In fiscal 2018, A.H. Harris assets will generate revenues of roughly $360 million while its EBITDA will be roughly $40 million and earnings per share accretion will be of 18 cents. Earlier in August 2017, the company successfully divested its Waterworks business unit. This move was intended to reduce debt, use the resources for growth investments and provide healthy returns to shareholders.In the last 30 days, the company’s earnings estimates for fiscal 2018 (ending January 2019) were revised upward by eight brokerage firms while that for 2019 (ending January 2020) by four firms. The Zacks Consensus Estimate currently stands at $3.16 both for fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019, reflecting an increase of 9.3% and 12.9%, respectively, from their respective tallies, 30 days ago.Also, the company has a positive Earnings ESP of 0.33% for fiscal 2018 and 0.82% for fiscal 2019.

154,GWW,"Investors interested in stocks from the Industrial Services sector have probably already heard of HD Supply (HDS  -  Free Report) and W.W. Grainger (GWW  -  Free Report). But which of these two stocks is more attractive to value investors? We'll need to take a closer look to find out.There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks, but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns. The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends, while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits.HD Supply and W.W. Grainger are sporting Zacks Ranks of #2 (Buy) and #3 (Hold), respectively, right now. This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that HDS is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent. But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors.Value investors analyze a variety of traditional, tried-and-true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, as well as the P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years.HDS currently has a forward P/E ratio of 13.28, while GWW has a forward P/E of 20.50. We also note that HDS has a PEG ratio of 0.85. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. GWW currently has a PEG ratio of 1.70.Another notable valuation metric for HDS is its P/B ratio of 5.37. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, GWW has a P/B of 8.88.Based on these metrics and many more, HDS holds a Value grade of B, while GWW has a Value grade of C.HDS has seen stronger estimate revision activity and sports more attractive valuation metrics than GWW, so it seems like value investors will conclude that HDS is the superior option right now.

Caterpillar now expects adjusted earnings per share between $10.25 and $11.25 for fiscal 2018 backed by these factors as well as positive economic indicators globally and many of the company’s end markets. The mid-point of $10.80 reflects year-over-year rise of 56%. Performing Ahead of the Industry: The company surged 50.4% over the past year, higher than the S&P 500’s growth of 13.7% as well the broader industry’s increase of 47.9%.  We note that the industry is also favorably placed as it occupies a space in the top 17% of the Zacks classified industries (43 out of the 256). Estimates Northbound: Estimates for Caterpillar have moved up in the past 60 days, reflecting the optimistic outlook of analysts.

Further, Latin America will continue on its growth path. Improvement in Mining Activity, Oil & Gas: Global economic momentum and increasing commodity prices is restoring miners’ profitability and they are resuming capital spending. This bodes well for the Resource Industries segment. Sales into Oil and Gas applications are projected to increase in 2018, aided by reciprocating engines for gas compression and well servicing activity in North America. The current turbines backlog remains robust in support of the midstream pipeline business. The company anticipates an increase in Transportation primarily from recent acquisitions in rail services. Power Generation sales are forecast to improve after a multi-year downturn. Sales into Industrial applications are projected to rise in 2018 driven by projected demand in EAME. Cost Cuts, Investment in Digital Capabilities: Ongoing efforts to reduce costs will help boost margins.

156,GWW,"Weakness in the technology sector as well as fears over the outcome of U.S.-China trade war pulled down the major U.S. indexes on the first trading day of April, though some recovery was witnessed a day later. These burning issues might influence investors’ view of the U.S. equity universe in the days ahead, especially for the companies in the tech sector.However, despite these near-term concerns, we believe that the country’s solid fundamentals and some recent policy changes will help in strengthening its prospects.

A hammer chart pattern is a popular technical indicator that is used in candlestick charting. The hammer appears when a stock tumbles during the day, but then finds strength at some point in the session to close near or above its opening price.

The increase in the guidance factors in a contribution of 50 cents from the better-than-expected fiscal 2017 operating performance, benefit from lower corporate tax rate under U.S. tax legislation along with incremental share buybacks funded by the benefits of the tax legislation. The company anticipates higher sales and earnings as well as a higher operating margin in fiscal 2018. The mid-point of the EPS guidance reflects an 18% growth compared with prior year. The company maintains sales growth guidance in the range of 3-7% for the full year. Positive Earnings Surprise History:  The company has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, delivering an average positive earnings surprise of 11.99%. Positive Estimate Revisions, Growth Projections: The Zacks Consensus for fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019 has gone up 3.0% and 0.4%, respectively, over the past 30 days.

An above-average ROA denotes that the company is generating earnings by effectively managing assets. Growth Drivers in Place: Grainger’s pricing initiatives have been driving growth. The company will continue its pricing strategies in the United States through 2018. It expects solid volume growth due to these actions and an improved demand environment. It announced a plan to take $150-$210 million of cost out of the Canada business in fiscal 2017. The company continues to make strong progress on that plan. In Canada, Grainger laid the foundation for a complete business model reset in late 2017. The company remains focused on improving services to customers and consistent direct-to-customer shipping. Further, it is focusing on Canada’s cost structure through branch reductions and creation of North American centers of excellence. Other Stocks to Consider Some other top-ranked stocks in the same sector include Komatsu Ltd. (KMTUY  -  Free Report), H&E Equipment Services, Inc. (HEES  -  Free Report) and Caterpillar Inc. (CAT  -  Free Report).

Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge. With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research. It's not the one you think. See This Ticker Free >>

This was partly offset by a decline of 3 pp in price and 1 pp from the divestiture of a specialty business in the United States in mid-July. The figure also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,568 million. There were 63 selling days in the reported quarter, same as in fourth-quarter 2016.Cost of sales increased 8.8% year over year to $1,611 million. Gross profit increased 3% to $1,021 million from $990 million recorded in the year-ago quarter. Gross margin contracted 130 basis points (bps) to 38.8%.Grainger’s adjusted operating income in the quarter increased 4% to $285 million from $275 million recorded in the prior-year quarter. Adjusted operating margin fell 30 bps to 10.8% in the quarter from 11.1% in the year-earlier quarter.Segment PerformanceRevenues for the U.S. segment rose 5% year over year to $1,991 million, resulting from 11 pp increase from volume partially offset by declines of 5 pp from price and 1 pp from the divestiture of a specialty business. Adjusted operating income for the segment decreased 1% year over year to $299 million.Revenues of $189 million from the Canada segment increased 4.5% in U.S. dollars. The increase consisted of 5 pp from favorable foreign exchange and 4 pp increase from price, partially negated by 4 pp decrease from volume. The segment reported an adjusted operating loss of $4.3 million compared with a loss of $10.7 million incurred in the prior-year quarter.Revenues from Other businesses (which include Asia, Europe and Latin America) climbed 16% year over year to $559 million, primarily driven by MonotaRO in Japan and Zoro in the United States. The segment’s adjusted operating profit improved 51% to $25 million from $17 million recorded in the comparable period last year.Financial PositionGrainger had cash and cash equivalents of $327 million at the end of 2017 compared with $274 million at the end of 2016.

Revenues came in at $10.4 billion, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $10.36, and also improved 3% on a year-over-year basis.GuidanceTo reflect lower corporate taxes due to U.S. tax legislation and better-than-expected 2017 results, Grainger raised its earnings per share guidance for 2018.

The increase in the guidance factors in a 50 cents contribution from the better-than-expected 2017 operating performance, a $2.15-benefit from a lower corporate tax rate under the U.S. tax legislation and 6 cents from incremental share buybacks funded by the benefits of the tax reform. However, these gains will be partially offset by 10 cents of lower benefits from clean energy investments and 26 cents in increased investment in the business, funded by the gains of the tax legislation.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?It turns out, fresh estimates have trended upward during the past month.

160,GWW,"Investors with an interest in Industrial Services stocks have likely encountered both Ashtead Group PLC (ASHTY  -  Free Report) and W.W. Grainger (GWW  -  Free Report). But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks? Let's take a closer look.The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions, while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits.Currently, both Ashtead Group PLC and W.W.

161,GWW,"On Jun 13, we issued an updated research report on Greif, Inc. (GEF  -  Free Report). The company is poised to gain from its focus on capital-expansion projects, favorable price-cost relationship and the U.S. tax reform. However, persistent raw material cost inflation, concerns in the China business and elevated expenses might mar the company’s growth in the near future.Let’s illustrate the factors in detail.Greif to Gain From Capital-Expansion ProjectsGreif’s performance will be supported by capital-expansion projects and acquisitions. The company recently commissioned the Kaluga steel drum plant in Russia, which further fortifies its presence in the country, as well as strengthens its partnerships with strategic customers. It continues to expand its global IBC footprint, with the recently-commissioned new lines in Spain, Houston, and new lines being added in Chicago, Russia and the Netherlands.Greif will also benefit from the expansion of the company’s plastic offerings by adding several new blow mowers in the United States and small plastic lines in Israel. In Paper Packaging, its expansion in MultiCorr is complete and operational in time for the agricultural season. It is also expanding the CorrChoice sheet feeder network with a new facility in the mid-Atlantic region. This project is expected to be operational in Q4 of fiscal 2019. These capital projects and expansions will drive the company’s performance.Tax Reform to Drive EarningsGreif currently anticipates additional financial flexibility as a result of the tax-reform changes regarding cash repatriation. The company expects the tax rate to be between 28% and 32% for fiscal 2018, lower than 33.5% recorded in fiscal 2017.Favorable Price-Cost Relationship to Boost ResultsGreif raised its adjusted earnings per share guidance for fiscal 2018 to $3.45-$3.70, on the back of improved price-cost balance in containerboard. Its RIPS segment is expected to report the strongest adjusted operating profit in fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 due to the timing of raw material pricing adjustments.Further, the company’s Paper Packaging segment will deliver the strongest operating profit performance in the fiscal fourth quarter, benefiting from containerboard price increases. Old corrugated container (OCC) costs are currently favorable when compared with the fiscal 2017 levels. Greif assumes that the blended OCC cost for the entire fiscal will be $93 a ton compared to the prior projection of $137 a ton.Inflation Remains a WoeGreif’s performance will be impacted by the prevalent raw material cost inflation through the rest of fiscal 2018. Its Rigid Industrial Packaging segment continues to experience significant steel price increase due to the Section 232 tariffs.Concerns in China businessGreif expects its China business to continue experiencing lower volumes as a result of the ongoing competitive market conditions, strategic pricing decisions, and a plant closure of a significant customer.Escalating Expenses to Impede Greif’s ProfitGreif raised its other expense outlook for fiscal 2018 to $15-$20 million, due to elevated pension costs related to a change in investment return assumptions. This will impact earnings by 8 cents per share in the fiscal.Share Price PerformanceGreif has outperformed its industry with respect to price performance over the past three months. The stock has gained 5.2%, while the industry has recorded growth of 0.5%.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderGreif currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Better-ranked stocks in the same sector include Axon Enterprise, Inc (AAXN  -  Free Report), DMC Global Inc.

162,GWW,"Caterpillar Inc. (CAT  -  Free Report) reported a rise of 24% in global retail sales for the three months ended May 2018, a deceleration from the 28% rise witnessed in April and  average sales growth of 30% noted in the past four months of this year. This deceleration can primarily be attributed to the slowdown in Resource Industries and Energy & Transportation compared with the prior months. Nevertheless, Resource Industries and Construction Industries continued to report positive gains for the 11th and 16th consecutive months, respectively. The company’s share price dipped 1.77% due to the disappointing performance. In May, Caterpillar’s performance was led by a rise of 43% in sales in Latin America followed by growth of 36% noted in Asia Pacific. North America sales were up 20% while Europe, Africa and Middle East (“EAME”) sales improved 16%. Compared with April, sales growth decelerated across all regions, except Asia Pacific. Resource Industries, Energy & Transportation Disappoint Resource Industries segment reported growth of 35% in May, lower than 57% rise witnessed in April as all regions posted lower results compared with the previous month. Sales in Latin America soared 124% while EAME sales surged 42%. North America reported growth of 37%. Sales in Asia Pacific dipped 3%, after posting growth for seven consecutive months. Notably, Asia Pacific had reported an average positive growth of 40% in the first four months of this year. Sales growth in the Construction Industries segment went up 22%, compared with the rise of 23% noted in April. Sales advanced 42% in Asia Pacific and 18% in Latin America. North America and EAME sales rose 17% and 9%, respectively. Sales in the Energy & Transportation segment rose 5%, a major drop from the average sales growth of 18% in the past four months. The Oil & Gas sector and Power Generation sector reported sales growth of 31% and 3%, respectively. This was offset by the Transportation sector and Industrial sector’s sales decline of 40% and 12%, respectively.  Caterpillar Hikes Dividend In a separate development, Caterpillar announced that its board of directors has approved an increase of 10% in quarterly dividend to 86 cents per share. The move reflects the company’s balance sheet strength and improved cost structure which has once again enabled it to deliver incremental returns to shareholders. The increased dividend will be paid on Aug 20 to shareholders of record as of Jul 20. The last dividend hike had come in June 2017, when it was raised by 1.3% to 78 cents. The company has consistently paid a cash dividend every year since its inception and a quarterly dividend since 1933.  Caterpillar’s has a five-year average dividend yield of 3.12% and five-year average payout ratio of 57%. With the increased dividend, Caterpillar’s dividend yield will go up from the current 2.0% to 2.2%. Is the Recent Slowdown Worth Worrying About? The company’s overall retail sales growth graph has remained in the positive territory since March 2017. Retail sales averaged 10.3% in 2017 and 29% in the first five months of 2018. Consequently, Caterpillar has gained 47.7% over the past year, outperforming the industry’s rally of 46.5%.  The dip in sales growth witnessed in May is a transitory phase in all probability as the company is likely to benefit from strong order rates, lean dealer inventories and an increasing backlog through the balance of 2018. The Construction segment will gain from infrastructure development in China and continued demand improvement in North American residential, non-residential and infrastructure markets. Rising commodity prices will drive Resource Industries and Energy & Transportation’s revenues. Cost cutting efforts and additional investments in expanded offerings and services will drive growth. Caterpillar currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. Other Stocks to Consider Some other top-ranked stocks in the sector include Axon Enterprise, Inc. (AAXN  -  Free Report), DMC Global Inc. (BOOM  -  Free Report) and W.W. Grainger, Inc. (GWW  -  Free Report). All of these stocks carry the same rank as Caterpillar. Axon Enterprise has expected long-term growth rate of 25%. Its shares have surged 167% in a year’s time. DMC Global has expected long-term growth rate of 20%. Its shares have appreciated 219% over the past year. Grainger has expected long-term growth rate of 12%. Its shares have appreciated 78% over the past year 5 Medical Stocks to Buy Now Zacks names 5 companies poised to ride a medical breakthrough that is targeting cures for leukemia, AIDS, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, and other conditions. New products in this field are already generating substantial revenue and even more wondrous treatments are in the pipeline.

163,GWW,"Briggs & Stratton Corporation (BGG  -  Free Report) has been off investors’ radar for quite some time now, due to input cost inflation, unfavorable weather and near-term challenges in its Engines business. Given these concerns, shares of Briggs & Stratton have lost 26.2% so far this year, underperforming its industry's decline of 0.4%. Will Briggs & Stratton’s Woes Continue? The company witnessed an unseasonably cold start to spring in the United States and Europe, which impacted its third-quarter fiscal 2018 results. The unfavorable weather continued into April for most of the Northern United States, including catastrophic snowstorms in the upper Midwest. This unusual weather pattern will likely impact fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 earnings as well. Briggs & Stratton’s residential engine sales are anticipated to be impacted as channel partners remain cautious on adding inventory to prepare for a significant brand transition, with the launch of the Craftsman brand at Lowe's Companies, Inc. (LOW  -  Free Report). Also, engine sales in Europe will be affected as channel partners remain cautious about ordering inventory in the wake of new EU emission standards that will come to effect in the future.  Also, significant increases in freight rates remain a headwind. The availability of trucks has struggled to keep up with the demand, subsequent to the launch of electronic driver logs this year. Higher freight costs of $4 million (pre-tax) are expected to dent margins in fiscal 2018.  The recently imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum will also lead to raw material inflation. Other Unfavorable Readings For the current fiscal, Briggs & Stratton has seen three downward estimate revisions versus no revision in the opposite direction over the past 60 days. This has led to 14% plunge in the Zacks Consensus Estimate to $1.31 per share over the past 60 days. For the fiscal, three estimates moved down in the past 30 days compared with no upward revision. This has caused the Zacks Consensus Estimate to trend lower, to $1.60, marking an 11% drop, from $1.79 a share 60 days ago. Undoubtedly, the above negatives substantiate the company’s Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). Forget Briggs & Stratton, Check These Industrial Product Stocks DMC Global Inc.’s (BOOM  -  Free Report) earnings estimates for full-year 2018 have increased 61% to $2.03 per share in the last 60 days while estimates for 2019 rose 28% to $2.94 per share.

166,GWW,"The Chinese Year of the Dog kicked off on Feb 16, which has historically been promising for the U.S. stock market. Astute investors, thus, should turn bullish and use this encouraging calendar year to their advantage. And why not? The Republican tax overhaul is expected to have a positive effect on earnings this year. Fears of surging inflation and higher interest rates, on the other hand, are unwarranted and likely to ease.Year of the Dog is Great for the U.S. Stock MarketThe U.S. equity market traditionally performs well in the Year of the Dog, per LPL Research. Data from as early as 1950 showed that the 12-month return on the broader S&P 500 in the year was up more than 15% on average.In four of the last five Year of the Dog, the market clocked double-digit gains. In 1958, returns were the highest, up 32.9%. In the most recent one ending in 2006, the returns were also quite solid, increasing 12.4%. YearS&P 500 Return in the Year of the Dog195832.9%197012.7%198220.7%1994-2.3%200612.4%Average15.3%(Source: LPL)Ryan Detrick, Senior Market Strategist at LPL added that “in fact, out of the 12 zodiac signs, no year sports a better average return.” In the past Year of the Goat, Tiger, Ox, Rabbit, Pig, Monkey, Dragon, Horse, Rat, Rooster and Snake, the S&P 500 had given an average return of 14.9%, 13.8%, 13.5%, 10.6%, 10.5%, 9.2%, 8.7%, 6.3%, 3.2%, 1.8% and 0.8%, respectively.Though a few may be skeptical about investing based on stars, but this Year of the Dog has certainly started off on a bullish note. The S&P 500 managed to log its sixth straight rise on Feb 16. After all, U.S. earnings expectations have sharply accelerated on tax stimulus, while inflation scares are overblown.Tax Plan to Boost EarningsThe Trump administration’s tax cut policy is expected to boost earnings, in a market that already has historically high valuations. The headline-grabbing move was that the corporate tax rate is lowered from 35% to 21%. Republicans also repealed the 20% corporate alternative minimum tax, while any income brought back from overseas will be taxed 8% to 15.5%, instead of the current 35% (read more: GOP Passes Landmark Tax Bill: Best & Worst for Stocks).Earnings growth this year is set to be healthy. Most of the S&P 500 companies have provided guidance that exceeded expectations, while the Q4 earnings season is already on track to be quite impressive. For the 398 S&P 500 members that have reported results, earnings are up 14.5% from the same period last year on 9% higher revenues, with 77.9% beating EPS estimates and 75.6% surpassing revenue estimates.In fact, Q4 earnings among all sectors are expected to be up 14% from the same period last year on 8.2% higher revenues. This will follow the 6.7% earnings growth recorded in the third quarter of 2017 on 5.8% higher revenues (read more: What Will Retail Earnings Show?).Inflation and Rate Hike Fears OverblownA surge in inflation in January possibly leading to faster-than-expected rate hikes did trigger a sudden panic among investors. Higher inflation would prompt the Federal Reserve to hike short-term interest rates at a faster pace than expected. This, in turn, will increase borrowing costs for businesses and consumers, which could eventually lead to a slowdown in the economy.But, market pundits believe that the spike in inflation last month will fizz out. Even though the consumer price index (CPI) inched up 0.5% in January from the previous month, it stayed at 2.1% in January on a year-over-year basis. Thus, it has fallen from the nearly 3% annual growth rate in the last three months. Meanwhile, the Fed’s preferred inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, has been below the central bank’s 2% target since mid-2012.  Wage growth in January also doesn’t hint at a surge in cost of living. After all, wages rose on colder-than-normal weather condition, which is a seasonal factor. Further, if managers and supervisors’ salaries are excluded, hourly wages increased at a sluggish pace. This showed that much of the increase was not evenly distributed and concentrated mostly on managers (read more: Wages See Fastest Growth Since 2009: Top 5 Gainers).5 Biggest GainersGiven the bullishness, investing in stocks that can make the most of the Year of the Dog seems judicious. We have, thus, selected five such stocks that are poised to yield stellar returns this calendar year that constitute bulk of the Year of the Dog.These stocks also flaunt a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and a VGM Score of A or B.

167,GWW,"On Feb 19, we issued an updated research report on Deere & Company (DE  -  Free Report). The company is poised to gain from the Wirtgen acquisition, higher housing starts, and improving oil and gas sector. However, the company’s lackluster agriculture business and elevated expenses are expected to dent its performance in the near future.  Let’s illustrate the factors in detail.Wirtgen Acquisition to Boost Deere’s Construction BusinessIn December 2017, Deere acquired world’s leading road-construction equipment maker — Wirtgen — for $5.2 billion in cash and debt. This buyout will aid Deere’s North America-centric construction business expand to a global scale and also catapult it to the position of an industry leader in global road construction. The transaction is also anticipated to add about 56% of its Construction & Forestry segment’s sales in fiscal 2018.Higher Housing Starts a Boon for DeereDeere projects global sales for the Construction & Forestry equipment to be up a massive 80% in fiscal 2018, driven by higher housing starts in the United States. Single-family housing starts are strong across all regions in the nation. Further, increasing wages and job growth reinforce the outlook for growing housing starts.Per the latest report of the U.S. Census Bureau, housing starts in January 2018 came in 9.7% higher than the December tally and are up 7.3% year over year. This January, U.S. new-home construction grew to the highest level since October 2016. It is expected that this momentum in the housing market will continue through the year.Stabilizing Oil Prices to Fuel GrowthDeere estimates that its construction investment will be up 2.2% in fiscal 2018, higher than the previous forecast of 1.4%. The increase is primarily being led by oil and gas, and residential activity. Oil prices are estimated to average above $58 a barrel for the fiscal. In addition, machinery rental utilization rates continue to improve and rental pricing continues to gain positive traction.Agriculture Business a Concern for DeereDeere’s agriculture business will be affected in fiscal 2018 by the expectation of high global grain and oil seed stocks-to-use ratios. This is because abundant crops have offset strong demand around the world. Further, the U.S. farm cash receipts are estimated to be $372 billion, approximately 1% lower than fiscal 2017, as gains from oil crops are offset by declines in feed crops.Adverse Impact of Tax ReformDeere’s earnings will be hurt by the impact of the tax reform in fiscal 2018. The company recorded equipment operations tax rate of 422% in first-quarter fiscal 2018, primarily due to the impact of the tax reform. For the remainder of the fiscal, the effective tax rate is projected in the range of 25-27%, which implies an effective tax rate of approximately 62% for fiscal 2018.Escalating Expenses to Impede Deere’s ProfitIn addition, Deere will be affected by elevated expenses in the current fiscal. Its guidance for cost of sales as a percent of net sales is about 75% for the fiscal. The company believes an unfavorable product mix, elevated overhead spending and increased incentive compensation will drive the cost of sales guidance. Deere also forecasts SA&G expense to flare up nearly 23% in the fiscal. These expenses will dampen earnings.Share Price PerformanceDeere has outperformed its industry with respect to price performance in a year’s time. The stock has appreciated around 54.5%, while the industry has recorded growth of 44.8% during the same time frame.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderDeere currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the same sector are Dover Corporation (DOV  -  Free Report), W.W. Grainger, Inc. (GWW  -  Free Report) and H&E Equipment Services, Inc. (HEES  -  Free Report). All three stocks sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Dover has a long-term earnings growth rate of 13%.

168,GWW,"With markets in correction mode, it’s very difficult to select stocks that will offer steady returns going forward. Investors may apply complex investment strategies with an aim to book higher returns but may not be rewarded with the desired returns.Thus, at present, investors should use conventional strategies, based on key fundamentals, to select stocks. One such strategy is focus on sales growth.Why Sales Growth?Investors often fail to keep an eye on sales growth while picking stocks, as a company’s share price is usually sensitive to its earnings momentum. Nonetheless, earnings are not the be-all and end-all in the sense that books can be easily manipulated. That’s why sales should always be taken into consideration.Sales growth is actually an important indicator of a company's health and ability to sustain its business. It offers investors an insight into product demand and pricing power. The main advantage is that the sales figure is generally not manipulated and is less volatile than earnings.Without some revenue growth, bottom-line improvement may not be sustainable in the longer term. While a company can show earnings strength by reducing expenses, a sustainable bottom-line recovery usually requires sales growth.Focusing exclusively on sales growth is not enough though. A healthy sales growth rate is certainly a positive indicator for picking good stocks, but it does not ensure profits. So, taking into consideration a company’s cash position along with its sales number can prove to be a more dependable strategy.Substantial cash on hand and a steady cash flow give a company more flexibility with respect to business decisions and potential investments. Cash also enables a company to endure market downturns. Most importantly, a sufficient cash position indicates that revenues are being channelized in the right direction.Selecting the Winning StocksIn order to shortlist stocks that have witnessed impressive sales growth along with a high cash balance, we have selected 5-Year Historical Sales Growth (%) greater than X-Industry and Cash Flow greater than $500 million as our main screening parameters.But sales growth and cash strength are not the absolute criteria for selecting stocks. So, we added certain other factors to arrive at a winning strategy.Price-to-Sales (P/S) Ratio less than X-Industry: This metric determines the value placed on each dollar of a company’s revenues. The lower the ratio, the better it is for picking a stock since the investor is paying less for each unit of sales.% Change F1 Sales Estimate Revisions (4 Weeks) greater than X-Industry: Better-than-industry estimate revision has often been seen to trigger an increase in the stock price.Operating Margin (Average Last 5 years) greater than 5%: Operating margin measures how much every dollar of a company's sales translates into profits. A high ratio indicates that the company has good cost control and sales are increasing faster than costs, an optimal situation for the company.Return on Equity (ROE) greater than 5%: This metric will ensure that sales growth is translated into profits and the company is not hoarding cash. A high ROE means the company is spending wisely and is in all likelihood profitable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Here are five of the 20 stocks that qualified the screening:Based in Seattle, WA, Starbucks (SBUX  -  Free Report) operates as a roaster, marketer, and retailer of specialty coffee. The company has expected sales growth rate of 10.6% for the current fiscal year and carries a Zacks Rank #2.W.W.

169,GWW,"Looking for a stock that might be in a good position to beat earnings at its next report? Consider W.W. Grainger, Inc. (GWW  -  Free Report), a firm in the Industrial Services, which could be a great candidate for another beat.This company has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. In fact, in these reports, GWW has beaten estimates by at least 10% in both cases, suggesting it has a nice short-term history of crushing expectations.Earnings in FocusTwo quarters ago, GWW expected to post earnings of $2.57 per share, while it actually produced earnings of $2.90 per share, a beat of 12.8%.

In fact, the Earnings ESP for GWW is positive, which is a great sign of a coming beat.After all, the Zacks Earnings ESP compares the most accurate estimate to the broad consensus, looking to find stocks that have seen big revisions as of late, suggesting that analysts have recently become more bullish on the company’s earnings prospects. This is the case for GWW, as the firm currently has a Zacks Earnings ESP of +0.91%, so another beat could be around the corner.This is particularly true when you consider that GWW has a great Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) which can be a harbinger of outperformance and a signal for a strong earnings profile. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.When you add this solid Zacks Rank to a positive Earnings ESP, a positive earnings surprise happens nearly 70% of the time, so it seems pretty likely that GWW could see another beat at its next report, especially if recent trends are any guide.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

170,GWW,"Shares of W.W. Grainger, Inc. (GWW  -  Free Report) have gained around 22% over the last three months. The company has also outperformed its industry's growth of roughly 9%. Grainger has a market cap of roughly $15.7 billion and average volume of shares traded in the last three months is around 1.01 million. The company has expected long-term earnings per share growth of 9.7%. Let's take a look into the factors that are driving this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock.  Driving Factors Forecast-topping earnings performance in the last reported quarter and upbeat outlook for 2018 have contributed to Grainger' rally. The company’s fourth-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings per share of $2.94 came in higher than the prior-year figure of $2.45 by 20%. Further, earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.18 by a wide margin of 35%. The company witnessed strong volumes in its U.S. business, driven by strategic pricing initiatives as well as an improving demand environment. Grainger reported revenues of $2,632 million, up 6.5% from the prior-year quarter figure of $2,471 million, driven by an increase of 11 percentage point (pp) from volume growth. The figure also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,568 million. Grainger raised fiscal 2018 earnings per share guidance range to $12.95-$14.15 from the previous range of $10.60-$11.80. The increase in the guidance factors in a 50 cents contribution from the better-than-expected fiscal 2017 operating performance, benefit from lower corporate tax rate under U.S. tax legislation and incremental share buybacks funded by the benefits of the tax legislation. The company anticipates higher sales and earnings as well as a higher operating margin in fiscal 2018. The mid-point of the EPS guidance reflects an 18% growth compared with the prior year. The company maintains sales growth guidance in the range of 3-7% for the fiscal. Grainger’s pricing initiatives have been driving growth. The company will continue its pricing strategies in the United States through the fiscal. It expects solid volume growth due to these actions and an improved demand environment. W.W. Grainger, Inc. Price and Consensus  W.W. Grainger, Inc. price-consensus-chart | W.W. Grainger, Inc. QuoteThe company is taking steps to bring the Canada business back to profitability.

In first-quarter 2017, Grainger posted a negative earnings surprise of 4.32%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Grainger will beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Unfortunately, that is not the case here as elaborated below:Zacks ESP: Grainger has an Earnings ESP of -2.29%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate of $2.56 comes below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.62. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Grainger’s Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) further lowers the predictive power of ESP.

Grainger, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  W.W. Grainger, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | W.W. Grainger, Inc. QuoteFactors Likely at PlayWe expect Grainger’s results to be affected by acceleration in its pricing actions. The company decided to accelerate its pricing actions this year instead of 2018 to gain new customers and grow with existing customers. The price acceleration is a headwind to its 2017 and 2018 gross margins.Grainger, in April, lowered its sales and earnings per share guidance for 2017 due to unfavorable impact of strategic pricing actions in the U.S. The company now sees sales growth of 1–4%, down from the earlier guidance of 2–6%. It also expects earnings per share to be in the range of $10.00–$11.30 compared to the previous view of $11.30–$12.40.Further, the company’s Canada segment continues to be challenged due to escalating expenses. Fluctuation in oil prices are also expected to hamper this segment’s results. Moreover, Grainger’s bottom line is likely to face the brunt of elevated expenses.Share Price PerformanceYear to date, Grainger has underperformed the Zacks classified Industrial Services sub-industry with respect to price performance.

180,GWW,"W.W. Grainger, Inc. (GWW  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release fourth-quarter 2017 financial numbers before the opening bell on Jan 24. Its fourth-quarter earnings are likely to dip year over year due to higher expenses despite a rise in revenues. In the last reported quarter as well, the distributor of maintenance, repair, and operating (MRO) supplies; and other related products and services reported a dip of 5% in earnings to $2.90 per share while revenues edged up 1.5%. However, both earnings and revenues managed to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimates.  The stock has struggled so far this year due to multiple headwinds, underperforming the industry it belongs to. The stock has tanked 6.8%, wider than the industry’s decline of 3.9%. Will the upcoming earnings release exert more pressure on the stock? Notably, Grainger delivered an earnings beat in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 4.23%. Our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat in the third quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Unfortunately, that is not the case here as elaborated below:Zacks ESP: Grainger has an Earnings ESP of +3.76%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate of $2.27 is pegged higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.18. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. Zacks Rank: Grainger’s Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) lowers the predictive power of ESP. It should be noted that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions. W.W. Grainger, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise W.W. Grainger, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | W.W. Grainger, Inc. QuoteFactors Likely at PlayWhile volumes will improve driven by price initiatives and improved demand environment, the bottom line is likely to face the brunt of elevated expenses. Expenses in the fourth quarter will be higher due to normal seasonality and also due to the incremental investments in the single channel online business and digital marketing.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total sales of $2.6 billion indicates 2% growth from the prior-year quarter. However, growth in the top line will not translate to growth in earnings due to higher expenses as evident from drop of 11% in earnings projected by the Zacks Consensus model. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings for the fourth quarter is currently pegged at $2.18 compared with $2.45 reported in fourth-quarter 2016.Even though the company remains focused on improving gross margins and reducing cost structure in Canada, the segment continues to be challenged due to higher expenses. Further, given that oil and gas and energy exposure in Canada is very high, the segment remains affected by fluctuation oil and gas prices. Per the Zacks Consensus Estimates, net sales in the Canada segment will rise 6% to around $191 million in the fourth quarter. However, due to the abovementioned reasons, the segment will likely report an adjusted operating loss of $11.4 million, wider than the operating loss of $10.7 million in fourth-quarter 2016.Per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, net sales in the Unites States will increase 2% year over year to $1,935 million. The segment will report 12% drop in adjusted operating income to $263 million due to higher expenses.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some stocks you may want to consider, as according to our model they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Deere & Company (DE  -  Free Report), with an Earnings ESP of +5.64% and a Zacks Rank #1.

181,GWW,"We issued an updated research report on W.W. Grainger, Inc. (GWW  -  Free Report) on Jan 16, 2018. Weakness on Canada operations and inflationary expenses are expected to weigh on the company’s results in the near term. Tepid Guidance Grainger’s third-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings per share of $2.90 came in lower than the prior-year figure of $3.06 by 5%. During the third-quarter conference call, the company lowered 2017 guidance. It now expects 2017 sales growth of 1.5-2.5%, down from previously projected range of 1-4%. Earnings per share are now expected to lie between $10.40 and $10.90, down from the prior guidance range of $10.00-$11.30. The midpoint of the earnings guidance reflects an 8% year-over-year decline due to ongoing challenges in Canada operations and headwind from the sale of the specialty business.Results Anticipated to be Lower than Prior-Year Levels The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 for earnings is $10.71, reflecting dip of 7.51% from 2016 levels. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth quarter is currently pegged at $2.18, depicting year-over-year decline of 11.02%. Factors That Will Dent Margins Expenses in the fourth quarter will be higher due to normal seasonality and incremental investments in the single channel online business as well as digital marketing. From 2017 to 2019, Grainger expects inflationary expenses to be approximately $80-$85 million, which is about 2% of the base annually. These actions will result in significant operating expense leverage which is likely to hurt the margin performance. Grainger’s new web pricing strategy was launched to reverse unfavorable market share trends, which the company has witnessed in certain market segments in recent years. Meanwhile, Grainger’s pricing initiatives are driving solid growth. Further, the company will continue pricing strategies in the United States through 2018 and expects to cut down prices by 6.9% in the period.  However, it will affect margins in the short term. Also, it remains to be seen whether the company can retain customer base if competitors also resort to slashing prices. Weak Canada Operations Continues to be a Drag Grainger’s Canada segment continues to be underperform due to higher expenses and weakness in the energy sector. The company is amid a substantial transformation in the Canadian business. The company continues to manage expenses and trying to turnaround the business. It has announced the closure of 59 branches and eliminated poorly performing assets. It remains to be seen whether its efforts will yield results. Grainger’s shares have fallen 5.2% in the past year, wider than the industry’s decline of 1.5%.  Currently, Grainger carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the sector are Deere & Company (DE  -  Free Report) , H&E Equipment Services, Inc.

While earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate, revenues missed the same.The distributor of maintenance, repair, and operating (MRO) supplies; and other related products and services may be in for a disappointment in the third quarter too.
