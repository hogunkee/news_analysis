0,ANSS,"The Computer Software industry is benefiting from continued strong digital transformation demand environment.Software has become the focal point of technological innovation. The last few years have witnessed a series of breakthroughs in cloud computing, predictive analysis, artificial intelligence (AI), self-driving vehicles, digital personal assistants and Internet of Things (IoT), consequently setting the stage for strong growth in the software industry.Moreover, continued enterprise investment in big data and analytics along with the ongoing adoption of Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) presents significant growth opportunity for industry players.Notably, the cloud offers a flexible and cost-effective platform to develop and test new applications and the deployment time is also much shorter as compared with legacy systems.Additionally, the increasing need to secure cloud platforms, amid growing incidences of cyber attacks and hacking, continues to drive demand for cyber security software.Further, as enterprises continue to move their on-premise workload to cloud environments (emergence of hybrid cloud), application and infrastructure monitoring have gained utmost importance. This is creating more demand for performance management monitoring tools that are not only scalable but also suitable for cloud-based environments.Industry Returns PositiveRobust demand for software and continuing innovations have been the key catalysts to consistent earnings and impressive sales growth. These are mainly behind investor confidence instilled in the Computer Software industry’s growth prospects.The Zacks Computer Software Industry, within the broader Zacks Computer And Technology Sector, has outperformed both the S&P 500 and its own sector over the past year.One-Year Price PerformanceWhile the stocks in this industry have collectively gained 34.1%, the Zacks S&P 500 Composite and Zacks Computer And Technology Sector have rallied 13.7% and 19.2%, respectively.We believe the near-term growth prospects are bright given increased spending by enterprises on software procurement.Stretched Valuation a ConcernHowever, the Computer Software industry’s valuation looks stretched at the moment. One might get a good sense of the industry’s relative valuation by looking at its price-to-earnings ratio (P/E), which essentially shows how much an investor is willing to pay for each unit of earnings.Notably, a lower P/E ratio is always better.The industry currently has a forward 12-month P/E ratio of 26.65, which is close to the highest level over the past year.The space also looks expensive when compared with the market at large, as the forward 12-month P/E ratio for the S&P 500 is 17.14 and the median level is 18.28.Price-to-Earnings Ratio (F12M) Moreover, a comparison of the group’s P/E ratio with that of its border sector ensures that the group is trading at a huge premium. The Zacks Computer And Technology Sector’s forward 12-month P/E ratio of 19.71 and the median level of 20.50 for the same period are way below the Zacks Computer Software Industry’s respective ratios.Price-to-Earnings Ratio (F12M) Improving Earnings Outlook to Drive OutperformanceNevertheless, strong industry fundamentals and expectations of solid top-line growth should help Computer Software stocks continue generating positive shareholder returns in the near future.Investors would also be eager to watch whether this group has the potential to perform better than the broader market in the quarters ahead. One reliable measure that can help investors understand the industry’s prospects is the earnings outlook for its member companies. Empirical research shows that a company’s earnings outlook significantly influences the performance of its stock.One could get a good sense of a company’s earnings outlook by comparing the consensus earnings expectation for the current financial year with the last year’s reported number, but an effective measure could be the magnitude and direction of the recent change in earnings estimates.The consensus earnings estimate for the Zacks Computer Software industry of $3.13 per share reflects solid year-over-year improvement. Moreover, the trend in earnings estimates revisions have been favorable of late.Price and Consensus: Zacks Computer Software IndustryLooking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are gaining confidence in this group’s earnings potential.The consensus EPS estimate for the current fiscal year has been revised 2.6% upward since Mar 31, 2018.Current Fiscal Year EPS Estimate Revisions Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Solid ProspectsThe group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates continued outperformance in the near term.The Zacks Computer Software industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #63, which places it at the top 25% of more than 256 Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Our proprietary Heat Map shows that the industry’s rank has continuously improved over the past five weeks.Long-Term Growth Prospects StrongThe long-term (3-5 years) EPS growth estimate for the Zacks Computer Software industry appears promising. The group’s mean estimate of long-term EPS growth rate has remained steady since March 2018 to reach the current level of 11.89%. This compares to 9.8% for the Zacks S&P 500 composite.Mean Estimate of Long-Term EPS Growth Rate Computer Software’s long-term growth prospects are alluring. Growing adoption of hybrid cloud computing models, rapid usage of AI and machine learning tools, the proliferation of wearables & self-driving vehicles and increasing automation of the application development process bode well for the industry.Moreover, the growing usage of Internet of Things (IoT) at home, in office, for cars and every other conceivable place is also an incredible business driver. These factors are expected to drive top-line growth that has gained significant momentum since the end of 2016.  Moreover, another indication of solid long-term prospects is the improvement in the group’s gross margin. Bottom LineThe role of software is evolving. Apart from running devices and applications, its usage is expanding in managing infrastructure. Moreover, the industry is significantly benefiting from the ongoing cloud transition.SaaS companies are expected to register strong top-line growth due to a higher percentage of recurring revenues, subscription gross margin and a lower churn rate. Moreover, strong spending by enterprises is a positive.Moreover, software companies are poised to benefit the most from Trump's repatriation policy. This enhanced liquidity is expected to boost their appetite for strategic acquisitions.Despite stretched valuations, investors can build positions in the Computer Software industry based on the above-mentioned factors as well as strong earnings outlook.Here, we list four stocks that have been witnessing positive earnings estimate revisions and carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).(You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.)ANSYS, Inc.

Net revenues are anticipated in the range of $261-$281 million. ANSYS, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise ANSYS, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | ANSYS, Inc. Quote The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings shows an increase of 19.1% year over year to $1.06 per share for the to-be reported quarter. The consensus estimate for revenues is currently pegged at $275.8 million, up 8.8% year over year.Notably, the stock has returned 10.3% year-to-date, better than the 9.7% rally of the industry.  Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Acquisitions & Partnerships Expanding PortfolioANSYS has partnered with major CAD vendors — Autodesk, PTC and Siemens to provide data transfer services as well as build geometry modeling software solutions. The company is also increasing its reach in the cloud computing market on the back of its partnership with Amazon Web Services (“AWS”).Increasing demand for simulation particularly from industries like energy bodes well for the company. ANSYS collaborations with companies like NVIDIA, Ferrari, Taiwan Semiconductor, Synopsys and Grundfos have helped it to develop a varied range of products ranging from automotive reliability solutions, live simulation software to high performance steering wheels.These collaborations are not only enabling ANSYS to bring innovative solutions to the market but are also aiding it to enhance foothold in the competitive simulations market.Moreover, the company’s aggressive acquisition strategy has played a pivotal part in developing the company’s business in the past few years. With the help of strategic acquisitions such as SpaceClaim, Reaction Design and Evolutionary Engineering, ANSYS is now able to bring innovative products in the fields of 3D modeling, chemistry solutions and cloud computing respectively.Further, the acquisition of 3DSIM, a leading additive manufacturing simulation technology provider, will help ANSYS to foray into 3D metal printing and access the industry's only complete additive manufacturing simulation workflow. However, this buyout will not have any material impact on first-quarter results.During the quarter, ANSYS also bought France-based OPTIS. With the acquisition, OPTIS’ feature-rich virtual reality (VR) platform will complement ANSYS offerings to help automotive manufacturers supply safer driverless vehicles. Safer navigation will be ensured by development of futuristic camera, lidar and radar.However, the first quarter is anticipated to be the quarter of slowest growth for revenues, primarily due to lack of large deals that are scheduled for the second half of the year. Moreover, margin is expected to remain under pressure as ANSYS continues to invest on product development.What Our Model SaysAccording to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP.

12,ANSS,"On Dec 26, we issued an updated research report on Citrix Systems, Inc. (CTXS  -  Free Report). The stock has been downgraded to a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) from a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Going by the Zacks proven model, the Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) are likely to underperform the broader market over the next one-three months.Reasons Behind the DowngradeHigh costs are limiting the company’s bottom-line growth and the fourth quarter is likely to be no different in this regard. Additionally, declining revenues from products also pose a severe challenge to the company. Moreover, frequent management changes do not bode well for the company and have potential to shake investors’ confidence in the stock. Notably, in July, the company made a change at its helm, replacing Kirill Tatarinov with David J. Henshall as its chief executive officer (CEO). Henshall’s appointment implies that Citrix has had four CEOs in less than two years.The company’s results are also liable to be affected by foreign exchange movements as it continues to foray into non-U.S. markets.Shares of Citrix Systems have underperformed the industry it belongs to in a year. The stock has declined 3.3% against the industry’s gain of 33.9% over the same period. The company’s VGM Score of C also raises concerns. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of all these three scores.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the same space are Nuance Communications, Inc.

16,ANSS,"The third-quarter reporting cycle is past the halfway mark with 272 S&P 500 members, representing 64.2% of the index’s total market capitalization, having already released their results.Per the latest Earnings Preview, total earnings of these companies are up 8.7% on a year-over-year basis (75.7% of the companies beat EPS estimates). Total revenues are up 6.7% (66.2% of the companies beat top-line estimates).Third-quarter earnings of S&P 500 companies are anticipated to be up 5.4% from the year-ago quarter on revenues that are estimated to increase 5.5%. Notwithstanding the weak performance of the Finance sector, total earnings from the remaining index are expected to rise 7.7% while revenues are anticipated to grow 6.1% on a year-over-year basis.Notably, estimate revisions for the fourth quarter have been favorable. Though estimates largely moved north at the beginning of the earnings season, of late, there has been some movement in the opposite direction. Consequently, estimates are currently at the same level as the beginning of the quarter. However, with more companies releasing better-than-expected results, the revisions are anticipated to trend upward again.Technology Earnings Picture So FarAs of Oct 27, 54.4% of the total market capitalization has reported results. Total earnings of these technology companies surged 22% on a year-over-year basis (79.3% of the companies beat EPS estimates) while total revenue increased 8% (86.2% of the companies beat top-line estimates).The sector is benefiting from increasing demand for data centers, cloud-based platforms, Augmented/Virtual reality devices, advanced driver assisted systems (ADAS), Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions and Internet of Things (IoT) related software.These were evident from recent results reported by Intel (INTC  -  Free Report) and Microsoft.ExpectationsEarnings for the technology sector are now anticipated to be up 16% (up from 99%) on top-line growth of 7.6% (up from 6.9%).Let’s take a sneak peek into three technology companies that are set to report their quarterly earnings on Nov 1:We expect Facebook, Inc’s (FB  -  Free Report) results to be driven by strength in online and mobile advertising revenues as well as Instagram in third-quarter 2017.Facebook’s mobile ad business has fast emerged as the major contributor to its advertising revenues. Digital ad revenues are expected to sustain the momentum. Notably, Instagram’s ad platform is also an important cash cow for the company.Additionally, a huge user base of over 2 billion is a major positive for Facebook.Though it is approaching saturation level in North American and European markets, growth possibilities abound in Asia and the rest of the world.However, with ramped up investments, increasing cost is a headwind for the company. Moreover, increasing competition from Snapchat and Twitter is a concern.Facebook stock has gained 56.4% year to date, substantially outperforming the 29.5% rally of the industry it belongs to. Facebook currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.We anticipate ANSYS Inc (ANSS  -  Free Report), the dominant player in the high-end design simulation software market, to gain from its strong simulation portfolio in the third quarter. Growing recurring revenues base is also a positive. The company’s collaborations with the likes of NVIDIA, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, PTC and Synopsys are further tailwinds.However, transition from perpetual license contracts to longer term, time-based licenses at some of the company’s largest customers (in mature markets like the United States and Japan) is expected to affect software license and maintenance revenue growth in the near term.Shares of ANSYS have gained 46.8% year to date, outperforming the industry’s 36.3% rally. ANSYS currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp’s (CTSH  -  Free Report) third-quarter results are expected to be driven by its domain expertise and development of capabilities in sync with the ongoing digital transition. Acquisitions and partnerships have also played an important role in the company’s growth.However, geographic concentration risks with North America being a significant revenue contributor, and increasing competition from peers like Accenture, Infosys and Wipro are headwinds.Cognizant stock has gained 34.7% year to date, outperforming the 26.9% rally of the industry it belongs to. Cognizant currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

This will drag profitability.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total perpetual revenues is currently pegged at $54 million, which remains almost flat on a year-over-year basis.Unfavorable ESPWe believe that ANSYS is unlikely to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the third quarter due to an unfavorable combination of Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and Earnings ESP of 0.00%.

Out of these, a number of tech companies are slated to report quarterly figures over the next few days. So far, the earnings scenario for the overall sector has been pretty impressive.Technology Stocks Continue to OutperformAlthough the Q2 earnings growth is broad based, majority of the contribution is coming from three sectors, Technology being one among them. The other two solid performing sectors are Finance and Energy.Per the latest Earnings Outlook, 66.1% of the sector’s market cap in the S&P 500 index has already reported, as of Jul 28.

Earnings of these companies are up 18.8% from the same period last year, while revenues increased 8.4%.We note that the technology sector has been a strong performer on a year-to-date basis.
