12,FTI,"As Christmas approaches, many private-equity firms that bet on retail in the past decade are ruing the day. Again.The 2016 holiday shopping season will probably be another disappointment for junk-bond-rated merchants owned by the likes of Bain Capital Private Equity and Apollo Global Management, which by most accounts would dearly like to be rid of them. Chains from Claire's Stores to J. Crew Group, swimming against mounting debt and declining foot traffic at malls, won't get joy out of what's expected to be a difficult quarter for sales. It will do little to boost the chances they can engineer public offerings or find buyers.""There is no exit,"" said Jan Kniffen, founder of the consulting firm J. Rogers Kniffen Worldwide Enterprises in New York. ""Retailing is fairly gruesome right now in terms of getting return on your investment. It doesn't matter if you're public or private — everyone is struggling.""Back before the recession, when Americans were throwing money into buying houses and furnishing them and acquiring clothes and trinkets along the way, there was a rush to invest in retail properties. More acquisitions came later. Between mid-2003 and the end of 2008, some 482 retail leveraged buyouts were announced, with a combined value of $141 billion, according to an analysis by GLC Advisors of data compiled by Bloomberg.Now many owners are stuck.A few are already out of the picture, notably Sports Authority, a $1.4 billion buyout led by Leonard Green & Partners in 2006 whose assets were sold to liquidators in April. Others are eyeing debt walls, including Gymboree, a children's apparel seller taken private in 2010 by Bain Capital for $1.8 billion. The company's 9.125% notes are trading at about 53 cents on the dollar. Gymboree and Bain didn't respond to requests for comment.The stories are bleak for others, such as Neiman Marcus Group, a luxury department-store chain acquired in 2005 by Warburg Pincus and TPG Capital Management in a $5.1 billion leveraged buyout and purchased for $6 billion in 2013 by Ares Management and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board.How can Ares and the pension plan make their money back, let alone score a profit? Neiman Marcus reported a net loss of $407 million in its fiscal fourth quarter. U.S. luxury sales declined 3% in the past year, according to an October study from Bain & Co. A strong U.S. dollar is depressing foreign-tourist spending, putting a damper on the holiday outlook.""They're going to have to hold it until they can fix it,"" said Michael Appel, founder of Appel Associates, a consulting firm. ""In some cases, they may just say, 'We'd rather put the money to better use than just having it sit there.' ""Neiman Marcus and its owners didn't respond to requests for comment.Retailers need to be nimble to react to changing customer demands and quick to spend to update stores, train and hire employees, and improve merchandise. That's no easy exercise for this cash-strapped group.Take Claire's, once a destination for tween girls that has struggled to compete with online jewelry sellers and chains such as Forever 21. Loaded with $2.53 billion in debt after its 2007 leveraged buyout by Apollo, Claire's has to figure out how to pay creditors and manage its large fleet of stores. The company didn't respond to a request for comment and Apollo declined to comment.FTI Consulting is advising Claire's as it aims to hold off default, according to people familiar with the situation. Companies often turn to FTI for help with restructuring; it has worked with several chains, including RadioShack, that filed for bankruptcy in recent years.Even a surge in sales this quarter may not be enough to keep Claire's going, or inspire optimism for others.""Retailing has been a great sector since 1877, when David May opened his first department store,"" Kniffen said. ""But it's certainly gone through a lot of creative destruction.""MORE ABOUT RETAIL PROPERTY:Property REITs Breaking Down On Fed Rate Hike TalkWarehouse Space At A Premium As Retailers Race Against AmazonAre Retail Stores, Drive-Through Pickup Key To Amazon's Growth?

The companies had already formed a joint venture together last year. The merger is set to close in early 2017.FMC Tech shares closed down 4.7% on the stock market today. Schlumberger rose 1.4%, while Halliburton dipped 0.35%.Together FMC and Technip had revenue of $20 billion last year, more than Baker Hughes (BHI) and just under Halliburton and Schlumberger.Oilfield service providers are looking at mergers, as oil prices continue to remain under pressure. Schlumberger bought Cameron International last year. But Halliburton scrapped its takeover of Baker Hughes over worries it wouldn't pass antitrust regulators in the U.S. and Europe.Oilfield service providers have also scaled back their workforces to try to cut costs. Technip said last year it would cut 6,000 jobs. Halliburton, Schlumberger and Baker Hughes have made deep cuts as well, collectively laying off tens of thousands of workers.

Cisco (CSCO) and Salesforce (CRM) had upbeat reports that were good news for IT spending. General Motors (GM) and Uber tested self-driving cars on the road, joining Alphabet (GOOGL) Google cars, while Google held a major developers conference.The major averages continued to move sideways in a choppy fashion as the market remains under pressure. The Nasdaq rose 1.1% for the week after falling for the prior four weeks. The S&P 500 eked out a 0.3% rise while the Dow Jones industrial average lost 0.2%, its fourth straight weekly decline. The S&P 500 and Dow moved back above their 50-day moving averages on Monday as Apple rose on Buffett's stake, but then fell back as near-term Fed rate hike buzz took hold, pushing up the dollar. Thanks to Friday gains, the S&P 500, Dow and Nasdaq are slightly higher for the week.While some stocks broke out -- Salesforce and Lowe's -- older breakouts struggled. Facebook (FB) closed just below a buy point Thursday, though it regained its entry point on Friday. McDonald's (MCD) fell below its late March entry area.Minutes from the Federal Reserve’s April meeting showed policymakers are close to raising benchmark interest rates again next month, surprising Fed watchers who priced in an increase later in the year. But before raise rates for a second time, the Fed wants to see signs growth is picking up in Q2, along with stronger labor markets and inflation heading for the 2% target.New York Fed President William Dudley said the next day a rate hike in the June-July timeframe is reasonable, unless the economy stumbles. He said a June rate hike is ""definitely live."" Other policymakers made similar comments. The next meeting will be held June 14-15, followed by another on July 26-27.April consumer prices had their biggest monthly gain in three years. Weekly jobless claims fell sharply after spiking to the highest since February 2015 in the prior week. Industrial production was strong in April, but manufacturing surveys for May from the New York Fed and Philly Fed showed unexpected deterioration.Existing-home sales and housing starts rose for April, while builder sentiment was steady in May.Mega-investors piled into Apple. Warren Buffett disclosed on Monday May 13 that Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) bought 9.8 million shares of Apple last quarter, valued at about $1.07 billion at quarter’s end. Midweek, Greenlight Capital disclosed it raised its stake in Apple 30.7% to 8.2 million shares, and billionaire George Soros' Soros Fund Management said it took a 3,100-share stake in Apple. Buffett's investment reflects confidence in Apple's pipeline of products, including future iPhones or even a rumored Apple Car. But it also suggests a shift in Apple's lifecycle from a growth company to a value play.Apple stock rose 5.2% for the week after hitting a 23-month low in the prior week.Playing catch-up, Alphabet's Google introduced a voice-activated Wi-Fi speaker system with built-in search. Google Home, expected to ship in 2016, will compete with the Amazon.com (AMZN) Echo. Google’s new “Allo” messaging app features artificial intelligence, like Facebook's new “chat bot.” Google’s upcoming Android N upgrade to its mobile operating system will feature a virtual reality mode.

Apple rival Xiaomi plans to ship its Android-based TV set-top box to the U.S. in 2016.Both home improvement chains topped estimates on strong housing market growth and favorable spring weather, raising guidance. But Home Depot fell 2.5% on Tuesday and 1% for the week, as same-store sales growth cooled from 10.2% in Feb. to 6.7% in March and 4.3% in April. Meanwhile, Lowe’s shares climbed 6.4% to an all-time high, breaking out of a nearly four-month long consolidation.Salesforce.com reported Q1 EPS and revenue that topped views as the business software provider signed more big deals with enterprise customers. Billings rose 31% year over year, accelerating from 28% in Q4. Salesforce.com increased its full-year revenue guidance slightly to $8.2 billion. On its earnings call, management touted a new cloud alliance with Amazon Web Services. Salesforce stock jumped 6.1% for the week, breaking out of a base and nearly hitting an all-time high.Cisco Systems reported a 6% adjusted EPS gain for its fiscal Q3, with revenue up 3%, both edging past analyst forecasts. Profit and sales guidance was also bullish. Analysts had lowered expectations ahead of Cisco earnings due to the growing number of companies outsourcing to cloud computing service providers such as Amazon Web Services, reducing demand for Cisco’s networking gear. The lowered expectations also reflected lower spending on information technology overall.Well aware of the trends, Cisco is diversifying into newer, higher-growth segments such as software, data centers, security, wireless and the Internet of Things market.Cisco stock rose 5.4% for the week.The Energy Information Administration reported a domestic stockpile increase of 1.3 million barrels vs. a 3 million barrel decline expected by analysts. The American Petroleum Institute reported a drawdown of 1.14 million barrels. U.S. production continues to fall while gasoline demand ramps up.Oil prices hit fresh seven-month highs during the week. U.S. futures closed the week at $47.75 a barrel, up 3.3%.Goldman Sachs said that oil could hit $50 per barrel later this year as the market “likely shifted into deficit in May,” earlier than Goldman expected.

But sales dropped 5% to $16.2 billion, missing estimates. Same-store sales grew 1.2%, short of predictions for a 1.6% gain. Target’s Q2 EPS guidance of $1 to $1.20 widely missed expectations for $1.36.Shares plunged 7.1%, hitting their lowest levels since late 2014.Wal-Mart’s Q1 profit fell 5 cents to 98 cents a share but beat estimates by 10 cents. Sales rose 0.9% to $115.9 billion vs. forecasts for a drop to $113.2 billion. U.S. same-store sales climbed 1%, the seventh straight gain. For Q2, Wal-Mart sees EPS of 95 cents to $1.08, with the midpoint above estimates for 98 cents.Shares popped 7.6% for the week, retaking their 200-day and 50-day lines after gapping down in sympathy with Target on Wednesday.Outshining its ailing department store peers, TJX (TJX) Q1 EPS and sales rose 10% to 76 cents and $7.54 billion, comfortably topping. Comps rose 7%. The off-price retailer guided full-year EPS up to $3.35-$3.42, still shy of estimates. Off-price peer Ross Stores edged past Q1 EPS views with a 6% gain, but revenue's 5% gain to $3.09 billion missed. Comps grew 2%. Q2 and full-year EPS guidance fell short of consensus. Ross Stores fell 3.4% for the week, while TJX climbed 3.7%.General Motors acquisition Cruise Automation confirmed that its self-driving technology was being tested on Chevy Bolts after photos of the all-electric cars surfaced online.

But the carmakers face stiff competition from the likes of Toyota (TM), Tesla (TSLA) and Alphabet, which recently inked a tech deal with Fiat Chrysler (FCAU).Red Robin Gourmet Burgers (RRGB) plunged 21% this week to a 3-year low on weak sales and slashed revenue guidance. Sonic (SONC) said it would miss its own fiscal Q3 same-store sales target, triggering an 8.65% weekly stock loss. The reports, which followed a weak May 11 sales outlook from Wendy’s (WEN), intensified fears about burger competition as both value and upscale offerings spread. Wendy’s stock fell 2.8%. Shake Shack (SHAK), which popped on solid results earlier this month, slid 6.9%. McDonald’s lost 4.9%.Campbell Soup (CPB) and Hormel (HRL) reported disappointing quarterly results, perhaps indicating that sluggish consumer spending is spilling over into the foods group. Hormel, the parent of Spam lunch meat, Skippy peanut butter and other leading brands, plunged xx% for the week to a 2016 low. Q2 earnings growth was strong as sales in 4 of 5 product groups rose, Hormel also raised guidance.

But sales fell 1.6% to $1.87 bil, missing Wall Street’s target. Shares fell 6.4% Friday and 9.4% for the week, falling to a 3-month low.

Samson, which is preparing to file for bankruptcy protection this month, has indicated it will abandon another floor next year, and its lease gives it the right to withdraw from more space after that, according to the report.

17,FTI,"Samson's shrinking footprint is laying bare the risks faced in cities that boomed amid the U.S. shale revolution — and are now the most vulnerable to the commodities rout. That's increasing concern in the market for commercial mortgage bonds, where yield-hungry debt investors have helped fund everything from office space for oil executives to housing for rig workers.

"
29,FTI,"The global markets have experienced a late summer swoon, blamed on factors including concerns about slowing growth in China and the impact of a potential increase in US interest rates this autumn. Whatever the reason, we think it is important to put these types of market corrections in context, remain calm and look for potential opportunities. 
"
30,FTI,"We don't know for sure whether the market rout has ended, or has further to go. We would note that many of the world's stock markets have not seen a significant correction in many years. Individual markets like Brazil or Russia are down more than 30% this year, but many others have not experienced losses that we would classify as being in a bear market. General pessimism and uncertainty prevails in markets right now, so it is possible some markets could fall further before we see stabilization. Nevertheless, over the last 20 years or so, our team has witnessed a general increase in volatility in all markets (equity, commodities and fixed income) brought on, we think, by increased use of derivatives and the strong influence of changing government policies spread by an exponential increase in news flow on the Internet. 
"
31,FTI,"We do know valuations in a number of markets and sectors were getting quite expensive, so this market downturn isn't all that surprising to us. Most notably in China, it was clear to us that the domestic A-Share market had seen intense speculation that had taken over and pushed that market up to unsustainable highs in record time on the back of government encouragement. With the inevitable denouement taking place, Chinese investors are now complaining about their market losses and the government has been active in trying to revive the market's fortune. 
"
32,FTI,"China's central bank has cut interest rates this week (the fifth rate cut since November), and has loosened reserve requirements. There isn't a whole lot central bankers can do when the money that is already in the system isn't being put back into the market; not only because confidence has been lost but also because of various prudential requirements, the banks have not increased lending. China's central bank hopes its latest measures will enable the release of money from the banking system. 
"
33,FTI,"My main message during times like these? Don't be afraid to buy when everyone else is selling. But remember also that the best time to buy is when all the sellers have finished their selling—which may be easier said than done! 
"
34,FTI,"Bulls and Bears and Opportunities 
"
35,FTI,"While market declines can be painful for investors, we like to view them as periods of opportunity; we look to pick up bargains in anticipation of an eventual market recovery. 
"
36,FTI,"I have studied stock markets in emerging countries and found that their bull markets have generally lasted longer than their bear markets, and the bull markets have tended to go up more in percentage terms than bear markets went down.1 Of course, how emerging markets behaved in the past does not necessarily predict how they will behave in the future, but I believe one must take a long-term view and average your investments over a period of time—attempting to time the market can be a frustrating exercise. It can take fortitude to invest when the outlook is bleak and others are selling, but that's often when the best values can be uncovered—if you do your homework. 
"
37,FTI,"That said, we use market corrections like the one we are experiencing to very cautiously and very selectively pick up stocks for our portfolios. Right now, we are particularly interested in consumer-oriented stocks in China and a number of other emerging market countries, because that is where we see growth long term. 
"
38,FTI,"Our Views on China Haven't Changed 
"
39,FTI,"Despite recent market volatility, we consider the long-term outlook for China's market and economy to be good. We don't view this recent correction as the start of any sort of economic or market collapse underway, and it doesn't change our view on investing there. 
"
40,FTI,"I would like to highlight some reform efforts in China that we believe appear to be positive: 
"
41,FTI,"- Ongoing efforts are being made to rebalance the economy away from exports and investment and toward domestic consumption, boosted by a continued rapid rise in wages. 
"
42,FTI,"- Plans to address overcapacity and promote an open, fair and transparent market suggest a more robust attitude to long-term profitability of state-owned enterprises (SOEs). While SOE reform has been a bit slow, we expect continued progress. 
"
43,FTI,"- We believe a more commercial approach among managements of SOEs could have a positive influence; we recently spoke with a manager from a major Chinese oil company who said they are implementing a system where pay is tied to performance. That's the type of thing we are looking for, and view as positive. 
"
44,FTI,"- Monetary policy easing in China, the eurozone and Japan is supportive of the financial system and the sustainability of debt. 
"
45,FTI,"A lot of attention has been given to slowing gross domestic product (GDP) growth in China. It bears repeating—China's growth rate may be slowing, but one of the things that gets lost in translation is that while the percentage increases in the economy are indeed slowing down, but the actual dollar amounts are going up. When China's economy was growing at 10% in 2010, about US$844 billion was added to the economy, but with growth at 7.7% in 2013, US$986 billion was added.2 I would also emphasize that 7% growth is nothing to sneeze at, either, given the size of China's economy. It should not be a shock to see growth slow. 
"
46,FTI,"I recently visited a mega-shopping mall in China, ""The New Century Global Center in Chengdu."" This 1.7 million square meter mall—more like a small town—contains offices, shops, more than 800 hotel rooms, a skating rink and a water park with an artificial beach and an artificial sun. During my visit, the mall was packed and hotel rooms full. This provided confirming evidence to me of the retail sales numbers we have seen in China recently, which remain fairly robust. More importantly given the high admission price (equivalent of about US$25) to the full-to-capacity indoor water park, and the brisk business I saw at the major department store in the mall, it was clear to me that spending capacity is good. 
"
47,FTI,"Anticipating a US Rate Hike Ahead 
"
48,FTI,"In our view, the downturn in emerging markets generally this year can also be attributed to fears about an interest rate increase in the United States, which will act to stem liquidity. While we don't know when the Federal Reserve (Fed) will start to tighten policy, the markets seem to be factoring it in. The uncertainty of the timing and degree of increases is what the market doesn't like, so while there may be additional volatility when the Fed does raise rates, I would expect some relief as the uncertainty eases. 
"
49,FTI,"The two largest emerging market economies, China and India, seem to us to be better positioned to cope with rising US interest rates than some other emerging economies, as they have internal growth drivers that are not as dependent on the United States. I believe China and eventually India will be the main drivers of global growth rather than the United States or Europe. We seem to be in a transitional stage of that change right now. China represents the second-largest economy in the world, and even if we were to assume a 5% growth rate, it is still much more than either the United States or the eurozone has been able to achieve in many years. 
"
50,FTI,"Looking at emerging Asia generally, we believe a combination of rapid economic growth, generally strong national finances and economic fundamentals have created an attractive landscape for equity investors. Expectations of high economic growth rates in emerging Asia (driven by China and India) remain a key attraction to us and we believe such growth rates will be comfortably in excess of developed market growth rates in 2015 and beyond.3 Moreover, many Asian markets, among them China, India, Indonesia and South Korea, have announced or embarked upon significant reform measures differing in details, but generally aimed at sweeping away bureaucratic barriers to economic growth, encouraging entrepreneurship and exposing inefficient industries to market discipline. Most are also looking to rebalance economic activity away from export- and investment-heavy models to become more oriented toward consumer demand. 
"
51,FTI,"""Successful Investing Is Not an Easy Job"" 
"
52,FTI,"Last but not least, I would like to emphasize that we are fundamental, bottom-up stock pickers, and the country and sector composition of our portfolios are the by-product of our stock selection process. Of course, we aren't infallible, and our timing may not be in sync with the mainstream media view that is focused on short-term news and outcomes. What's been happening in the energy sector is a case in point. The swift fall in crude oil prices that began last year surprised many portfolio managers and analysts, and many investors have fled companies in the energy sector. In our view, energy price volatility will likely always be present, but long-term demand growth remains intact. Despite witnessing softer commodity prices in general in recent years, we continue to invest in the sector and are focused on low-cost producers that we believe can withstand periods of lower prices. We also believe that many of these companies are trading at attractive valuations, appear to have solid fundamentals and should be more resilient during downturns. 
"
53,FTI,"At times, it can be quite difficult to withstand periods of uncertainty. But as Sir John Templeton once said: ""Successful investing is not an easy job. It requires an open mind, continuous study and critical judgment.""

56,FTI,"What Are the Risks? 
"
57,FTI,"All investments involve risks, including possible loss of principal. Foreign securities involve special risks, including currency fluctuations and economic and political uncertainties. Investments in emerging markets, of which frontier markets are a subset, involve heightened risks related to the same factors, in addition to those associated with these markets' smaller size, lesser liquidity and lack of established legal, political, business and social frameworks to support securities markets. Because these frameworks are typically even less developed in frontier markets, as well as various factors including the increased potential for extreme price volatility, illiquidity, trade barriers and exchange controls, the risks associated with emerging markets are magnified in frontier markets.

61,FTI,"Happy 80th birthday Social Security! Gail Buckner CFP, Vice President and our National Financial Planning Spokesperson, looks at its past, present and future. 
"
62,FTI,"Gail Buckner, CFP® Vice President National Financial Planning Spokesperson, Franklin Templeton Investments 
"
63,FTI,"Social Security was born out of controversy and compassion eight decades ago. President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the Social Security Act into law on August 14, 1935. 
"
64,FTI,"Most of us alive today are unaware of how controversial the program was considered at the time. Critics—and there were many—charged that it represented ""socialism"" and had no place in our democracy. Its constitutionality was challenged and upheld by two Supreme Court cases.1
"
65,FTI,"But in the wake of the worst financial depression in our nation's history, supporters argued that it was past time that the United States joined other developed countries in establishing a [contributory] system to care for some of our most vulnerable citizens: the elderly. 
"
66,FTI,"A Bit of History 
"
67,FTI,"Keep in mind that for more than a century, this country had been undergoing major social and demographic changes. After the Civil War, America entered its second ""Industrial Revolution."" More and more people had migrated from rural areas to factory towns and cities seeking work and wealth. 
"
68,FTI,"The problem was that when someone left their farm and extended family behind, they also lost their support system. When the Great Depression hit, millions of Americans found themselves jobless, homeless and starving. Food kitchens could not handle the demand. Getting sick was essentially a death sentence. Americans—many of them elderly—were literally dying on the streets of America's cities. If a father was out of work or fell sick, his wife and children suffered, too. 
"
69,FTI,"Social Security Is Always Evolving 
"
70,FTI,"Under the 1935 Act, not all workers were eligible for Social Security. It excluded part-time workers, domestic workers, social workers and those employed in government jobs, hospitals and schools.2 According to one historian, almost half the working-age population was not covered.3
"
71,FTI,"In addition, only the worker who earned the benefit received a check. But that was changed before the first regular Social Security check was issued. The Social Security Amendments of 1939 added benefits for family members of covered workers—wives (but not husbands) and widows. Children who lost their working father received a benefit, but did not if their working mother died. 
"
72,FTI,"As American society evolved, so did Social Security. In the early 1950s, coverage was extended to part-time workers, farm laborers, the self-employed as well as state and municipal employees. In 1956, ""early"" retirement for women, and benefits for disabled workers were added.4  The Social Security Act of 1965 not only created Medicare, it added benefits for divorced spouses.5 It took a landmark US Supreme Court decision in 1975 (Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld)6 for survivor benefits to be extended to children of deceased working mothers, dependent husbands and widowers, regardless of financial need. 
"
73,FTI,"The most recent change—extending spousal benefits to legally married same-sex partners—was brought about, not by Congress, but by the US Supreme Court.7 
"
74,FTI,"Financial Adjustments Are Common 
"
75,FTI,"Over the years, Social Security's tax rates and benefit amounts have been also adjusted in an effort to keep the program solvent. In the 1970s, in response to years of double-digit inflation, Congress approved automatic cost-of-living-adjustments (COLAs) to benefit amounts. 
"

Gail Buckner CFP, Vice President and our National Financial Planning Spokesperson, looks at its past, present and future. Gail Buckner, CFP® Vice President National Financial Planning Spokesperson, Franklin Templeton Investments Social Security was born out of controversy and compassion eight decades ago. President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the Social Security Act into law on August 14, 1935. Most of us alive today are unaware of how controversial the program was considered at the time. Critics—and there were many—charged that it represented ""socialism"" and had no place in our democracy. Its constitutionality was challenged and upheld by two Supreme Court cases.1But in the wake of the worst financial depression in our nation's history, supporters argued that it was past time that the United States joined other developed countries in establishing a [contributory] system to care for some of our most vulnerable citizens: the elderly. A Bit of History Keep in mind that for more than a century, this country had been undergoing major social and demographic changes. After the Civil War, America entered its second ""Industrial Revolution."" More and more people had migrated from rural areas to factory towns and cities seeking work and wealth. The problem was that when someone left their farm and extended family behind, they also lost their support system. When the Great Depression hit, millions of Americans found themselves jobless, homeless and starving. Food kitchens could not handle the demand. Getting sick was essentially a death sentence. Americans—many of them elderly—were literally dying on the streets of America's cities. If a father was out of work or fell sick, his wife and children suffered, too. Social Security Is Always Evolving Under the 1935 Act, not all workers were eligible for Social Security. It excluded part-time workers, domestic workers, social workers and those employed in government jobs, hospitals and schools.2 According to one historian, almost half the working-age population was not covered.3In addition, only the worker who earned the benefit received a check. But that was changed before the first regular Social Security check was issued. The Social Security Amendments of 1939 added benefits for family members of covered workers—wives (but not husbands) and widows. Children who lost their working father received a benefit, but did not if their working mother died. As American society evolved, so did Social Security. In the early 1950s, coverage was extended to part-time workers, farm laborers, the self-employed as well as state and municipal employees. In 1956, ""early"" retirement for women, and benefits for disabled workers were added.4  The Social Security Act of 1965 not only created Medicare, it added benefits for divorced spouses.5 It took a landmark US Supreme Court decision in 1975 (Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld)6 for survivor benefits to be extended to children of deceased working mothers, dependent husbands and widowers, regardless of financial need. The most recent change—extending spousal benefits to legally married same-sex partners—was brought about, not by Congress, but by the US Supreme Court.7 Financial Adjustments Are Common Over the years, Social Security's tax rates and benefit amounts have been also adjusted in an effort to keep the program solvent. In the 1970s, in response to years of double-digit inflation, Congress approved automatic cost-of-living-adjustments (COLAs) to benefit amounts. The Amendments of 1983 were a response to demographic changes such as increased longevity. These included raising the full retirement age8 to 66 (by 2005) and 67 (by 2027), making benefits subject to income tax if they exceeded a certain threshold, and raising the Social Security tax rate. Today, its widely agreed that we are simply at another point where, again, due primarily to demographic changes in American society—such as a continued decline in the birthrate and further improvements in life expectancy—we need to make changes.

112,FTI,"For long periods of time, the markets can advance relatively smoothly until a sudden onset of chaos occurs, a ""tipping point"" that quickly changes the picture. Some might say the recent drop in oil would be a case in point.

114,FTI,"In the March 2010 issue of Foreign Affairs Journal, Harvard history professor Niall Ferguson published a terrific article (IMHO) outlining the complexity of systems and the interaction of forces as it relates to the rise and fall of great societies throughout history. In it he described how large empires could be defined as complex systems that are ""asymmetrically organized,"" meaning their construction more resembles a termite hill than an Egyptian pyramid. As complex systems, these societies tended to share certain observable and ubiquitous features. These included the interaction of many dispersed agents, multiple levels of organization, sometimes a lack of central control, continual adaptation, incessant creation of new niches and the absence of uniformity. The author went on to describe how these systems operated somewhere between order and disorder—on ""the edge of chaos"" as he suggested—appearing quite stable for long periods and seemingly in a state of equilibrium. Eventually, however, this observable equilibrium would be disrupted. Very often it would be an ostensibly small event or action, a ""tipping point,"" that would trigger a meaningful disruption. 
"
115,FTI,"Scientists define this notion of ""edge of chaos"" as being in a ""critical state"" or near ""phase transition,"" such as the moments prior to water turning to steam or ice, or just before a nuclear reaction. This concept is not exclusive to the academic halls of science, however, nor is it restricted to applications related to states of matter and energy. These ""tipping points"" leading to ""phase transitions""—sometimes insignificant and sometimes world changing—surround us every day in the interactions and activities of our collective experience. They are at work in the earth's crust when shifting tectonic plates lead to an earthquake in California, in society when the courageous decision of a heroic black woman to no longer sit unjustly at the back of a bus leads to a paradigm shift in civil rights and cultural thinking, and of course in stock markets where home foreclosures in Nevada end with the bankruptcy of one of the most staid and iconic financial institutions on Wall Street. 
"
116,FTI,"Tipping points and phase transitions are everywhere and always, and could happen upon us at any moment in any circumstance. In terms of the markets, our world could easily be assessed as one that is perpetually on the brink of phase transition, or as described by economist John Mauldin in a ""state of stable disequilibrium."" That is to say that participants from all over the world are connected inextricably together in a complex and layered loom of investments, debt, trade, globalization, international business, finance, currency and banks. All operate in a critical yet stable state, in between periods of market rest (low volatility and bull runs) and reaction (high volatility and bears). 
"
117,FTI,"So this then begs the question, what are the sorts of tipping points that may trigger a market phase transition? Are they observable? Can they be monitored and anticipated? 
"
118,FTI,"Sand Piles 
"
119,FTI,"In the book Ubiquity: Why Catastrophes Happen (Crown Publishing, 2002) social scientist Mark Buchanan explores the concepts of complexity theory, chaos theory and critical states. While not directly addressing investments, the book does provide some insight and understanding as to why financial markets can seemingly advance for long periods relatively smoothly, sometimes years, until a sudden onset of chaos or Nassim Taleb's ""Black Swan""-type of events emerge, triggering market corrections or crashes. 
"
120,FTI,"The book describes the work of three physicists studying in 1987 at the Brookhaven National Laboratory on Long Island. The physicists, Per Bak, Chao Tang, and Kurt Wiesenfeld, used a computer program to create a virtual sand pile. The program was designed to stack one virtual grain of sand at a time and monitor the results, with an eye toward studying ""non-equilibrium systems,"" i.e., the crazy world that surrounds all of us every day—Wall Street notwithstanding. Over the course of their experiment the physicists learned some really interesting things. One might assume that they would have been able to observe some sort of pattern-like behavior in the sand pile, such as a typical size or number of grains required before a collapse, but this was not the case. On the contrary, each time the experiment was run the results were completely chaotic in their unpredictability. After a large number of tests with millions of grains of sand, they observed no patterns, no typical number required to trigger a system collapse. Sometimes it was a single grain, others 10, 100 or 5,000. Still others involved massive mountains of sand incorporating millions of grains that would collapse in a single and seemingly random onset of failure. In other words literally anything, at any time, might be just about to occur. Perpetually on the brink of phase transition. 
"
121,FTI,"This kind of stuff sticks with me when I think of the markets … and positioning portfolios. 
"
122,FTI,"In an attempt to gain some insight into the cause of such unpredictability in their sand pile game—or in an effort to assign some order to the disorder they observed—the scientists pushed their experiment further. Now they looked at the virtual sand pile from above, and they color coded its regions according to steepness, with relatively flat areas green and steeper sections red. 
"
123,FTI,"In the beginning the pile was mostly green of course (though it still would collapse periodically) but as the game progressed more red areas began to infiltrate, until eventually a dense skeleton of random red danger spots coursed through the sand like tributaries in the Mekong Delta. This offered some insight into the peculiar behavior (though no real predictability), as a grain of sand falling on a red spot could, by domino-like action, cause a sliding at other nearby red spots. 
"
124,FTI,"If the red network was sparse and all trouble spots were well isolated, then a single grain would likely have only limited repercussions if any; again, the triggering was random. But as the red spots began to grow and interconnect the impact of the next grain would become fiendishly unpredictable. Sometimes it fell innocuously and did nothing to the pile, sometimes a few grains tumbled, and every so often it set off a cataclysmic reaction sending walls of sand cascading down the entire pile. 
"
125,FTI,"Tributaries of Uncertainty 
"
126,FTI,"The author defines these as fingers of instability, but I prefer to consider them tributaries of uncertainty, and not for any copyright infringement risk or pride of authorship, but because ""instability"" implies, in a way, that an avalanche is imminent, when in fact the experiment showed there is no rhyme or reason. Things can happen just as easily as they cannot. The point being that we are always uncertain, and so we must always be prepared and sheltered appropriately for living in the uncertain world, investment portfolios notwithstanding. 
"
127,FTI,"If we did learn anything from the sand pile experiment it is that while we cannot predict what grain of sand may trigger the next phase transition, we can get a sense of the potential size and scope of any imminent disruption to the pile by looking at the steepness and the interconnectedness of the tributaries. 
"
128,FTI,"In terms of steepness of the market sand pile, there are ample data that we can observe that illustrates—both literally and figuratively—there is much surrounding us today. That said, we can observe that a significant number of tributaries of uncertainty throughout the pile appear quite extended. 
"
129,FTI,"So what about market interconnectedness, the other factor in the sand experiment? Unfortunately quantifying market interconnectedness is a bit more difficult from a data analysis standpoint. If there is a resonant lesson from periods of chaos such as 2008, 1987, etc., however, it is the understanding that things that do not correlate in normal conditions can and often do when sand castles crumble. That much we can be certain of. 
"
130,FTI,"The bottom line is that, while I cannot see the future, I do not believe the global marketplace is going to experience a major crash anytime soon (ideally never). Indeed, I am actually optimistic about prospects for equities this year. Nonetheless, I feel markets getting more fragile and volatile as the years move on. On some days it just feels spooky, and certainly not the time to be a full-on bull across the board. The markets today are like nothing they were even 10 years ago. That is not to say they are riskier, because again that is such an abstract and immeasurable quantity to gauge in aggregate that no one could ever know. But it is fair to say they are more complex, even by 2008 standards. The number of participants, assets under management, trading strategies, number of tradable instruments, the light-speed at which information is moved and processed … all of these are grains of sand building the pile. When things go wrong in a complex system, the scale of disruption is nearly impossible to anticipate. There is no such thing as a typical or average forest fire, for example. To use the jargon of modern physics, a forest before a fire is in a state of ""self-organized criticality"": it is teetering on the verge of a breakdown pending a spark, but the size of the breakdown is always unknown. 
"
131,FTI,"I do not know if the divergence we see among central banks in the world will continue. I have no idea if commodity prices will continue to collapse or if a rapid gain in US dollars versus foreign currencies will spark further deflation and contagion. Are 30-year lows in bond market yields hinting at an economic sinkhole?

In the beginning the pile was mostly green of course (though it still would collapse periodically) but as the game progressed more red areas began to infiltrate, until eventually a dense skeleton of random red danger spots coursed through the sand like tributaries in the Mekong Delta. This offered some insight into the peculiar behavior (though no real predictability), as a grain of sand falling on a red spot could, by domino-like action, cause a sliding at other nearby red spots. If the red network was sparse and all trouble spots were well isolated, then a single grain would likely have only limited repercussions if any; again, the triggering was random. But as the red spots began to grow and interconnect the impact of the next grain would become fiendishly unpredictable. Sometimes it fell innocuously and did nothing to the pile, sometimes a few grains tumbled, and every so often it set off a cataclysmic reaction sending walls of sand cascading down the entire pile. Tributaries of Uncertainty The author defines these as fingers of instability, but I prefer to consider them tributaries of uncertainty, and not for any copyright infringement risk or pride of authorship, but because ""instability"" implies, in a way, that an avalanche is imminent, when in fact the experiment showed there is no rhyme or reason. Things can happen just as easily as they cannot. The point being that we are always uncertain, and so we must always be prepared and sheltered appropriately for living in the uncertain world, investment portfolios notwithstanding. If we did learn anything from the sand pile experiment it is that while we cannot predict what grain of sand may trigger the next phase transition, we can get a sense of the potential size and scope of any imminent disruption to the pile by looking at the steepness and the interconnectedness of the tributaries. In terms of steepness of the market sand pile, there are ample data that we can observe that illustrates—both literally and figuratively—there is much surrounding us today. That said, we can observe that a significant number of tributaries of uncertainty throughout the pile appear quite extended. The bottom line is that, while I cannot see the future, I do not believe the global marketplace is going to experience a major crash anytime soon (ideally never). Indeed, I am actually optimistic about prospects for equities this year. Nonetheless, I feel markets getting more fragile and volatile as the years move on. On some days it just feels spooky, and certainly not the time to be a full-on bull across the board. The markets today are like nothing they were even 10 years ago. That is not to say they are riskier, because again that is such an abstract and immeasurable quantity to gauge in aggregate that no one could ever know. But it is fair to say they are more complex, even by 2008 standards. The number of participants, assets under management, trading strategies, number of tradable instruments, the light-speed at which information is moved and processed … all of these are grains of sand building the pile. When things go wrong in a complex system, the scale of disruption is nearly impossible to anticipate. There is no such thing as a typical or average forest fire, for example. To use the jargon of modern physics, a forest before a fire is in a state of ""self-organized criticality"": it is teetering on the verge of a breakdown pending a spark, but the size of the breakdown is always unknown. I do not know if the divergence we see among central banks in the world will continue. I have no idea if commodity prices will continue to collapse or if a rapid gain in US dollars versus foreign currencies will spark further deflation and contagion. Are 30-year lows in bond market yields hinting at an economic sinkhole? The one thing I do know—and firmly believe— is that it is imperative to build a portfolio that is effectively hedged and diversified.

139,FTI,"We at Templeton Emerging Markets Group believe high economic growth rates will remain a key attraction of many emerging markets in 2015. Even with major economies like Brazil and Russia slowing down, overall economic growth in emerging markets during 2015 is expected to be comfortably in excess of developed markets, with China and India likely to drive the Asian region to particularly strong growth. 
"
140,FTI,"Moreover, many emerging markets, among them China, India, Indonesia, Mexico and South Korea, have announced or embarked upon significant reform measures that differ in details but are generally aimed at sweeping away bureaucratic barriers to economic growth, encouraging entrepreneurship and exposing inefficient industries to market discipline. Most are also looking to rebalance economic activity away from export- and investment-heavy models to become more oriented toward consumer demand. 
"
141,FTI,"The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) economic community planned for 2015, which will bring 10 economically diverse Southeast Asian countries together into a single economic organization, represents another strand of reform in which more technologically advanced emerging economies are becoming increasingly interconnected with less-developed neighbors who possess resources of low-cost labor and commodities, to the potential benefit of both groups. The reform measures have had some short-term costs, but we believe that, should governments succeed in driving them through, longer-term benefits could soon begin to feed into economic growth figures. The emphasis on market discipline could also create a closer correspondence between emerging-market growth and corporate profitability. 
"
142,FTI,"We are enthusiastic about the potential of new technology to accelerate growth trends, with some Internet and mobile communications-based technologies in particular offering less-developed countries the opportunity to potentially leapfrog generations of economic change in more mature markets and move directly to efficient modern systems. (See chart on global smartphone sales below.) This factor could be a particularly dynamic driver of development in frontier markets that include much of Africa, which could give additional impetus to markets that already benefit from highly favorable demographics, abundant natural resources and low starting points in terms of existing per-capita gross domestic product.

143,FTI,"Potential Challenges Ahead 
"
144,FTI,"We do not disregard issues such as the recent weak economic performances in Brazil and Russia as well as the market-unfriendly direction of policy in those countries, nor do we dismiss the potential for Chinese military assertiveness in the South China Sea to create tensions or the profound nervousness displayed by investors at any sign that US monetary policy might be tightened. However, we believe both Russia and Brazil have the resources to bounce back strongly should more appropriate policies be adopted. With Russia in particular, much risk already has been discounted in exceptionally low equity valuations as of December-end, though the Russian government's unwillingness to soften its stance toward Ukraine could elicit more sanctions that result in a negative environment for investors, among other potential risks. Chinese maritime assertiveness should be placed in the context of other foreign policy moves such as the ""Silk Road"" initiatives aimed at improving relations and building trade with neighboring countries. 
"
145,FTI,"With regard to developed-market monetary maneuvers, it is important to note that many major developed countries are still loosening policy, with Japanese quantitative easing likely to be highly significant for Southeast Asia. Recently, exceptional levels of money creation have remained largely outside real economies as the velocity of money has slowed sharply, evidenced by the declining loan-to-deposit ratios of banks in the United States, Europe, Japan and China. As banks become more confident and resume lending activity, stocks of newly created money could begin to influence the real global economy. 
"
146,FTI,"As of December-end, the favorable trends in emerging markets appeared under-recognized in equity valuations that generally stood well below those of developed markets. Even after recent rallies in some emerging markets, they continued to appear relatively attractive to us in relation to history, particularly if very low bond yields and interest rates for savers are taken into account. With our ground-up stock investment research metrics continuing to identify what we believe are attractive long-term investment opportunities, we remain optimistic about the potential of emerging markets.

149,FTI,"What Are the Risks? 
"
150,FTI,"All investments involve risks, including possible loss of principal. Foreign securities involve special risks, including currency fluctuations and economic and political uncertainties. Investments in emerging markets, of which frontier markets are a subset, involve heightened risks related to the same factors, in addition to those associated with these markets' smaller size, lesser liquidity and lack of established legal, political, business and social frameworks to support securities markets. Because these frameworks are typically even less developed in frontier markets, as well as various factors including the increased potential for extreme price volatility, illiquidity, trade barriers and exchange controls, the risks associated with emerging markets are magnified in frontier markets.

151,FTI,"Global equity markets have hit a rough patch recently, with volatility intensifying in September and October. Many investors have been concerned about issues including the prospect of rising interest rates in the United States, deflation in the eurozone, fears about the spread of the Ebola virus, ISIS in the Middle East, growth in the global economy in general, and growth in China in particular. There have been some other country-specific issues as well. In times like these, various pundits start calling for the sky to fall, exacerbating investors' fears. However, I would remind investors that these periods of market volatility are not new or unexpected. 
"
152,FTI,"It seems like a good time to examine the role of investor psychology in the markets. Evidence gathered in the field of behavioral finance suggests that many, if not most, investors often base their investment decisions on sentiment, fads and other psychological biases, and not on fundamentals. Investors, even professionals, often make flawed, irrational financial decisions. 
"
153,FTI,"I can't say when this current bout of market volatility will end, but I can say, based on decades of experience navigating the markets, that it won't last forever. And, it will likely bring potential opportunities for the savvy investor who knows where to look.

154,FTI,"Behavioral Finance versus Traditional Finance Theory 
"
155,FTI,"Based on efficient market hypotheses, traditional financial theories assume that investors are rational and risk averse, and hold diversified, optimal portfolios. This assumes how investors ""should"" act based on mathematical models and theories. However, this does not always play out in practice. 
"
156,FTI,"In contrast, behavioral finance is based on understanding how people actually make financial decisions in practice. Behavioral finance suggests cognitive errors and emotional biases can impact financial decisions, often in a detrimental way. Cognitive errors are based on faulty reasoning (belief perseverance), or due to memory errors (information processing errors). Emotional biases stem from reasoning that is influenced by feelings or emotions, not fundamental facts. 
"
157,FTI,"Behavioral finance challenges the assumptions of traditional finance theory, recognizing that many investors do not make decisions in a rational manner. Investors are generally loss averse, and because their fears can get in the way, they do not necessarily hold optimal portfolios. 
"
158,FTI,"Behavioral finance suggests that people: 
"
159,FTI,"1) Are not risk averse, rather they are ""loss averse"" 2) Are not fully rational when making financial decisions 3) Exhibit ""asset segregation,"" i.e., they often analyze investments individually, and not as a portfolio. 
"
160,FTI,"I believe understanding both traditional finance theory and behavioral finance can provide a better means to achieve one's financial goals.

162,FTI,"The International Monetary Fund (IMF) recently downgraded its 2014 global growth forecast to 3.3%, 0.4% lower than its prior forecast given in April 2014 and below the levels of global growth seen in 2010 and 2011, when the world's economies were recovering from the global financial crisis.1 It's important to remember that this is just one forecast, and it's also important to remember that not all emerging markets are the same. The IMF actually increased growth projections in some cases. The growth projection for developing and emerging Europe was increased to 2.7% in 2014, 0.4% higher than what had been forecasted in April.2 More specifically in the region, growth in Hungary and Poland was projected to reach 2.8% and 3.2%, respectively, in 2014, according to the IMF.

Its weekly chart might look like a late-stage breakout, but Tractor Supply reset its base count in August 2011 so it's not as late stage as it looks.

195,FTI,"Graft: The relationship between the Clintons and the wife of embattled Anthony Weiner grows curiouser and curiouser. Forget sexting; this may be the real scandal. And one senator sees a possible criminal element to it.
"
196,FTI,"Republican Chuck Grassley, ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, is demanding documents from the State Department shedding more light on the private consulting work that Huma Abedin, aka Mrs. Weiner, performed while working for the government, where she had access to top secret information.
"
197,FTI,"Abedin served as former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's deputy chief of staff, where she earned $135,000 a year. But it turns out she at the same time worked as a consultant to the Clinton Foundation and a New York advisory firm closely tied to the Clintons, one that happens to do business before the government.
"
198,FTI,"Abedin reportedly hauled in as much as $355,000 in consulting contracts while on the government payroll. What she did for that dough is unclear. ""The State Department and Ms. Abedin haven't provided a single document that I requested,"" Grassley said. ""Putting up a stone wall raises a lot more questions.""
"
199,FTI,"While Hillary's old department stonewalls Grassley's document requests, her close aide Abedin is suddenly taking leave from her current job as head of her transition office, where by all accounts Hillary is preparing a 2016 run at the White House.
"
200,FTI,"Their sudden separation likely has more to do with Grassley's inquiry than Weiner's perversions.
"
201,FTI,"Grassley suspects Abedin was trafficking in political intelligence while employed at State. He says it appears the Clinton consulting shop — Teneo Holdings — was ""compensating Ms. Abedin for gathering information from government sources for purpose of informing investment decisions,"" a potentially serious conflict.
"
202,FTI,"Teneo's Wall Street clients have included MF Global, as it was collapsing. It also represents foreign governments.
"
203,FTI,"Teneo, which maintains offices in Dubai and Beijing, was founded in 2011 by former State Department official and Hillary 2008 fundraiser Declan Kelly, as well as former Clinton aide Douglas Band and Paul Keary, former senior managing director of FTI Consulting, a global consulting firm specializing in China.
"
204,FTI,"FTI's man in Washington, Jackson Dunn, served as an aide to both Bill and Hillary Clinton, as well as to former Sen. John Kerry, who succeeded Hillary at State. Teneo's ""intelligence CEO"" is James Shinn, a former Pentagon official focused on China.
"
205,FTI,"Band worked in the White House for Bill Clinton, who happens to be a well-paid adviser to Teneo. Band, who now also works in Clinton's Harlem office and for the Clinton Foundation, is the former president's right-hand man.
"
206,FTI,"Grassley wants to know what, if any, business Teneo was doing before State while it was paying Abedin. He's asked for a record of communications between Teneo and its clients and the department. He also wants to know if Hillary signed off on her outside consulting. So far, he's been stiffed.
"
207,FTI,"He'd also like to know why Abedin suddenly changed her employment status to ""special government employee"" in June 2012, which allowed her to leave Washington and work from New York.
"
208,FTI,"That same month, Abedin made headlines when several members of Congress sent a letter to State demanding more information about her family connections to the radical Muslim Brotherhood. While Abedin was advising Clinton, State abandoned its prior policy against official dealings with the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt and elsewhere.
"
209,FTI,"What other consulting contracts and contacts did Abedin maintain while at State, before June 2012? Grassley has asked for all the private contracts she signed while taxpayers thought they were paying her for full-time government work. But Abedin won't turn over any of them.

1097,FTI,"With the subsea recovery slowly gaining momentum, TechnipFMC plc (FTI  -  Free Report) was recently awarded a slew of three fresh contracts offshore Malaysia, the Gulf of Mexico (GoM) and Israel.

1101,FTI,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for TechnipFMC plc (FTI  -  Free Report). Shares have added about 4.9% in that time frame.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is FTI due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Fourth-Quarter 2017 ResultsTechnipFMC plc reported fourth-quarter 2017 earnings on a diluted basis (excluding one-time items) of 20 cents a share, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 44 cents. The weak results can be attributed to lower revenues amid reduced project activities from its subsea segment. The bottom line also deteriorated from the year-ago adjusted earnings of 50 cents a share.Revenues in the fourth quarter came in at $3,683 million below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3,834 million. Further, the revenues in the quarter under review also decreased 15.9% from the prior-year figure of $4,379.7 million.Segmental AnalysisSubsea: The segment’s revenues for the fourth quarter were $1,292.2 million, reflecting a decrease of 36.2% from the year-ago figure of $2,024.1 million. Reduced project activities in Europe, Africa and Asia pacific regions led to the lower revenues. Concurrently, operating profit came in at $67.4 million, down 53.9% year over year.Onshore/Offshore: This segment generated revenues of $2,019.5 million, down 2% year over year. Revenues declined due to completion of the first phase of a key LNG project, partly offset by increased activities in the Middle East, Europe and Asia Pacific regions. However, operating income jumped to $257.2 million versus operating loss of $55 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2016.  Strong project execution, especially successful progression of Yamal LNG project drove the profit of the segment.Surface Technologies: The segment’s revenues for the fourth quarter were $372.3 million, up 22.6% from fourth-quarter 2016 figure of $303.6 million. The increase is primarily attributed to the rising momentum in the North American as well as completion activity. Further, a favorable product mix and leaner cost structure helped the company to report an operating profit of $53.3 million against an operating loss of $5.3 million incurred a year ago.BacklogAs of Dec 31, 2017, TechnipFMC’s total backlog was $12,982.8 million compared with $16,743.9 million a year ago. Of this, backlog for Onshore/Offshore was $6,369.1 million, while Subsea and Surface Technologies backlogs were $6,203.9 million and $409.8 million, respectively.Capex & Balance SheetIn the reported quarter, TechnipFMC spent $85.3 million on capital programs. As of Dec 31, the company had cash and cash equivalents of $6,737.4 million and long-term debt of $3,777.9 million, with a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 22%.DividendThe board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 13 cents per share, payable on Apr 4, 2018 to shareholders of record as of Mar 20, 2018.GuidanceTechnipFMC projects revenues for Onshore/ Offshore segment to be within the range of $5.3-$5.7 billion in 2018, with an EBITDA margin of 10.5%, up from the prior guidance of 9.5%. Surface Technologies are expected to generate revenues between $1.5-1.6 billion, with EBITDA margin of 17.5%. The company estimates its subsea revenues to lie within $5-$5.3 billion, with EBITDA margin of 14%.  Capex for 2018 is estimated to be around $300 million.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in fresh estimates. There have been four revisions higher for the current quarter compared to two lower.TechnipFMC plc Price and Consensus  TechnipFMC plc Price and Consensus | TechnipFMC plc QuoteVGM ScoresAt this time, FTI has a poor Growth Score of F.

1103,FTI,"TechnipFMC plc (FTI  -  Free Report) reported fourth-quarter 2017 earnings on a diluted basis (excluding one-time items) of 20 cents a share, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 44 cents. The weak results can be attributed to lower revenues amid reduced project activities from its subsea segment. The bottom line also deteriorated from the year-ago adjusted earnings of 50 cents a share.Revenues in the fourth quarter came in at $3,683 million below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3,834 million. Further, the revenues in the quarter under review also decreased 15.9% from the prior-year figure of $4,379.7 million.TechnipFMC plc Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise TechnipFMC plc Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | TechnipFMC plc QuoteSegmental AnalysisSubsea: The segment’s revenues for the fourth quarter were $1,292.2 million, reflecting a decrease of 36.2% from the year-ago figure of $2,024.1 million. Reduced project activities in Europe, Africa and Asia pacific regions led to the lower revenues. Concurrently, operating profit came in at $67.4 million, down 53.9% year over year.Onshore/Offshore: This segment generated revenues of $2,019.5 million, down 2% year over year. Revenues declined due to completion of the first phase of a key LNG project, partly offset by increased activities in the Middle East, Europe and Asia Pacific regions. However, operating income jumped to $257.2 million versus operating loss of $55 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2016.  Strong project execution, especially successful progression of Yamal LNG project drove the profit of the segment.Surface Technologies: The segment’s revenues for the fourth quarter were $372.3 million, up 22.6% from fourth-quarter 2016 figure of $303.6 million. The increase is primarily attributed to the rising momentum in the North American as well as completion activity. Further, a favorable product mix and leaner cost structure helped the company to report an operating profit of $53.3 million against an operating loss of $5.3 million incurred a year ago.BacklogAs of Dec 31, 2017, TechnipFMC’s total backlog was $12,982.8 million compared with $16,743.9 million a year ago. Of this, backlog for Onshore/Offshore was $6,369.1 million, while Subsea and Surface Technologies backlogs were $6,203.9 million and $409.8 million, respectively.Capex & Balance SheetIn the reported quarter, TechnipFMC spent $85.3 million on capital programs.

1104,FTI,"TechnipFMC plc (FTI  -  Free Report) is set to release fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 21, after the closing bell.A leading manufacturer and supplier of technology solutions for the energy industry, TechnipFMC offers subsea, surface, onshore and offshore solutions for oil and gas projects.In the prior quarter, this London-based company reported weaker-than-expected earnings amid reduced project activities in Europe and Africa.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.TechnipFMC Price and EPS Surprise TechnipFMC, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | TechnipFMC, Inc. QuoteFactors to ConsiderThough oil prices have recovered from the historical lows, prices still linger around $60 per barrel, which is far below the breakeven price for many oil and gas firms even now. As a result, many energy companies continue to reduce spending and equipment suppliers like TechnipFMC struggle to protect its backlog amid the volatile price environment. For the fourth quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the total backlog order is pegged at $12,854 million against $13,902.4 million reported in the prior quarter. The backlog for subsea technologies is anticipated at $5,680 million against $5,949 million reported in third-quarter 2017. The Surface Technology backlog is also expected to decline to $352 million against 394.2 million reported in the previous quarter.Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $3,834 million for the quarter, down from the prior-year quarter figure of $4,141 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the revenues of the Onshore/Offshore segment is pegged at $1,867 million, lower than $2,308 million recorded in the prior quarter. Moreover, TechnipFMC’s subsea segment, which was once the largest and fastest-growing unit of FTI, is also facing pressure on its revenues and margins. In the last quarter, Subsea revenues and profits declined 37% and 71.3% year over year.The company has already cautioned that 2017 would be a difficult year with order growth set to remain weak. All these factors account for bleak earnings outlook for the company in fourth-quarter 2017.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that TechnipFMC is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter.

1105,FTI,"Heading into the New Year, both oil and natural gas futures experienced noticeable upticks on healthy storage draws.On the news front, energy explorer SandRidge Energy, Inc.  called off its merger with peer Bonanza Creek Energy, Inc. (BCEI  -  Free Report) following criticism from some of its largest shareholders, while oilfield services player McDermott International, Inc. (MDR  -  Free Report) announced the receipt of a contract in the Danish sector of North Sea.Overall, the sector ended 2017 on a bullish note. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures gained about 3.3% to close at $60.42 per barrel, while natural gas prices surged 11% to $2.9530 per million Btu (MMBtu). (See the last ‘Oil & Gas Stock Roundup’ here: Shell Boosts Power Market Presence, Cabot Sells Eagle Ford Assets)Posting its second annual gain in a row, oil prices closed 2017 up more than 12%. The last week of the year saw U.S. oil benchmark attain its highest closing since June 2015. The major catalyst was the Energy Department's inventory release, which revealed that crude stockpiles recorded another higher-than-expected weekly draw. On a further bullish note, domestic oil production snapped its steadily rising trend and fell for the first time since October. Data showing the number of U.S. oil rigs not rising for a third straight week helped cement those gains.Oil stockpiles have shrunk in 30 of the last 38 weeks and are down more than 100 million barrels since April. The gradual fall has helped the U.S. crude market shift from year-over-year storage surplus to a deficit. At 431.9 million barrels, current crude supplies are 11.1% below the year-ago period and the lowest since 2015.Meanwhile, natural gas was one of 2017’s worst-performing commodities, losing 21% during the period. However, the fuel gained substantial ground during the past week following a larger-than-average decrease in supplies. Favorable weather forecasts (translating into robust heating gas demand) added to the positive sentiment.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    Oil and natural gas company, SandRidge Energy recently announced that it has dropped its plan to acquire Colorado-based Bonanza Creek Energy, following intense opposition from its shareholders.

The plan was primarily opposed by New York-based Fir Tree Partners and activist Carl Icahn, the two largest shareholders of SandRidge. While Icahn holds 13.5% of Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) SandRidge shares, Fir Tree holds owns 8.3%. Following the decision, both the companies mutually dismissed the acquisition plan. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Although SandRidge – which emerged out of bankruptcy in 2016 – initially believed that the acquisition will help it to increase its DJ Basin hold and raise oil production, the majority of its shareholders felt it should better focus on the proportion of management compensation and company size and scale. The shareholders expect the company with a market cap of $654.184 million to mend its internal disparities before increasing its asset holdings.

(Read More)Trump Keeps Investors on TenterhooksAmidst much speculation regarding who will go on to head the Fed, investors eagerly wait for President Trump’s decision to choose Janet Yellen’s successor, post the expiration of her term as the Fed Chief in February, 2018. In a surprising move, Trump sought help of the Senate Republicans on Tuesday to zero in on a potential candidate for the post of Fed Chief. In a show-of-hands, Senators from the GOP unanimously vouched for Stanford University Professor John Taylor to be the next Chief of Fed. Trump would reportedly announce the name of Yellen’s successor officially before he heads out on a trip to Asia. Some experts commented that ‘show-of-hands’ might possibly be a decisive factor affecting Trump’s decision.Meanwhile, broader markets gained from positive investor sentiment due to hopes that the existing tax code would soon be amended. The green signal to the budget blueprint ensures taxpayers that existing tax codes would be rewritten, more so because it has unlocked a procedure using which President Trump and his team can push through their tax reforms using only Republican votes.Economic DataOn the economic data front, new home sales surged to 667,000 in September, up from 561,000 in August — an increase of 18.9% from the previous figure.

1111,FTI,"It was a week where oil prices extended the streak of gains but natural gas futures slipped again.On the news front, U.S. behemoth ExxonMobil Corporation (XOM  -  Free Report) was toppled by Russia’s Gazprom as the world’s top energy company, while smaller rival Chevron Corporation (CVX  -  Free Report) elected Michael Wirth to succeed john Watson as its next Chairman and CEO. Overall, it was a mixed week for the sector. While West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures gained about 2% to close at $51.67 per barrel, natural gas prices edged down 0.5% to $3.007 per million Btu (MMBtu). (See the last ‘Oil & Gas Stock Roundup’ here: BP Project Start-Up, PSXP Asset Buyout, RIG's Floater Retirement.)The U.S. oil benchmark wrapped up a strong quarter amid a surprise decline in US inventories and an improving supply-demand narrative. But data showing the number of U.S. oil rigs climbing for the first time in four weeks kept gains in check.The federal government’s Energy Information Administration (‘EIA’) report revealed that crude inventories decreased by 1.85 million barrels for the week ending Sep 22. The analysts surveyed by S&P Global Platts – the leading independent commodities and energy data provider – had expected crude stocks to go up some 1.3 million barrels.Meanwhile, energy bodies OPEC and IEA both recently raised global oil demand forecasts for this year. Also, supply from the 14-member OPEC cartel is set to remain constraint for at least the next six months, helping to tighten the market significantly. Adding to the positive momentum, OPEC and Russia claimed to be on the right track in clearing the global oil glut with half the job done.However, the commodity gave up some of its gains after the number of active rigs drilling for crude in the U.S. – an indicator of oil industry activity – rose by six to 750, as per data from oilfield services firm Baker Hughes Inc.On the other hand, natural gas futures finished slightly lower despite a smaller-than-expected increase in supplies. Unfavorable weather forecasts and strength in the commodity’s production, induced the minor drop in prices.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    Per the S&P Global Platts ranking of the top financial performers of the year, U.S. oil giant ExxonMobil Corporation was pushed down to the ninth spot from its top position. In fact, only two domestic companies could sustain their position in the Top 10 lists of the biggest financial performers. Valero Energy Corporation, an independent refiner in the United States secured the No.8 position, down from the No. 3 spot held last year. Another U.S. company that had a massive rank fall was Chevron Corporation, down to No.121 from No.17 last year.Russian energy company Gazprom dethroned ExxonMobil from theNo.1 spot in the 2017 S&P Global Platts Top 250 Global Energy Company Rankings.  Last year, Gazprom had secured theNo.3 slot.An energy economist explains that government support might have been a big factor that has led to the change in the rankings. The Russian government owns majority in Gazprom. Also, Gazprom’s No. 1 spot is significant of management's endeavor to combat low oil and gas prices, bans from low interest rate credit in Europe and its position as the EUs leading foreign supplier of natural gas, a market where the United States is seeking expansion opportunities.2.    U.S. energy giant Chevron Corporation recently announced plans to appoint Michael K. Wirth as the CEO and chairman as the company seeks managerial changes to deal with the volatile dynamics of the oil industry. Wirth, who is currently the vice chairman of the company, will take over as the CEO from Feb 1, 2018. He will be replacing John Watson who has served the company as the CEO for the last eight years.Persistent weakness and volatility in oil prices pose challenge to the upstream operations of the company as it is not being able to sell crude at viable prices and is unable to generate significant cash flows for shareholders. Chevron being an integrated player, is thus trying to increase its focus on downstream business which can be profitable in the current environment.In our opinion, Wirth’s appointment is a sound choice, given his substantial knowledge and experience regarding refining and petrochemicals.  With the election of Wirth as the CEO, Chevron will follow the footsteps of energy majors like ExxonMobil Corporation, Royal Dutch Shell plc and TOTAL S.A., all of whose CEO’s are refining specialists.Wirth joined Chevron in 1982 and became the vice chairman earlier this year. He has spent around 10 years as the executive vice president of Chevron's downstream and chemicals business. To exit non-competitive projects, Chevron divested downstream assets in Canada to Parkland as part of Wirth's strategy. It also lowered the company’s operating and capital costs. Apart from providing a leaner business model, it helped Chevron to progress toward its $5-$10 billion divestment goals for 2016-2017. (Read more Can Chevron Flourish With Michael Wirth at the Helm?)3.    Energy explorer Laredo Petroleum, Inc. (LPI  -  Free Report) recently entered into a deal to divest stake in Medallion Gathering & Processing, LLC which is a pipeline unit located in Permian Basin. Laredo holds a 49% stake in the pipeline while the remaining interest is owned by private investment firm The Energy & Minerals Group. Private equity firm Global Infrastructure Partners will acquire the Medallion pipeline for $1.825 million along with additional cash consideration. Subject to satisfactory closing conditions, Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) Laredo will receive $825 million from the transaction. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Laredo made its initial investment in the Medallion-Midland Basin crude oil pipeline system in 2013. The Medallion unit comprises more than 800 miles of pipelines spread over 325,000 net acres.  In around four years, the value of the pipeline has increased by $1 billion. The sale proceeds which will be received by Laredo reflect three times the invested capital and equivalent to an IRR of more than 65%.Laredo will use the sale proceeds to strengthen its balance sheet by reducing its $1.4 billion debt as on July 30. Interest savings arising from debt reduction along with favorable expected market conditions and production growth is likely to make the firm well positioned to become cash flow neutral by the end of 2019. The deal will also provide the firm with enough financial flexibility to focus on core operations and accelerate drilling activities in the Upper and Middle Wolfcamp formations.

In-field lines will be used to connect the new fixed platform with the existing platform. Apart from the EPCI obligation, TechnipFMC will assume the manufacturing and pre-commissioning works of the rigid and flexible lines and provide required subsea equipment.The project is located in Campos Basin, offshore Brazil. TechnipFMC has existing operations in Brazil and plans to use its local expertise as well as the global state of the art pipelay fleet for the project. The company previously worked on the surface trees package in this project. The offshore campaign is expected to start in 2019.5.    Domestic energy explorer Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation (COG  -  Free Report) finally settled a lawsuit filed by two families in Dimock, Pennsylvania.  Cabot Oil & Gas was accused of contaminating groundwater in the Pennsylvania town.Cabot Oil & Gas ramped up drilling activities in Pennsylvania’s Marcellus shale in 2008. In 2009, 15 Dimock families moved court against the company claiming that the drilling operations were responsible for polluting drinking water. However, all the residents made an out-of-court settlement except the families of Ely and Hubert.In March 2016, a jury of 10 issued a ruling holding the company guilty of groundwater contamination. The jury directed the company to pay $2.75 million to Elys and $1.49 million to Huberts. However, in March 2017, the U.S. Magistrate Judge Martin C. Carlson, overruled the jury’s $4.2 million award for the Dimock plaintiffs on account of weakness and irregularities in their testimony and arguments as well as missteps by their attorney. Carlson also turned down Cabot Oil & Gas’s request to pass a judgment in favor of the company and ordered a fresh trial.However, the oil and gas producer and the Dimock families have finally managed to reach a settlement, though the terms of the settlement remain undisclosed. This brings the decade long controversy to a close.

1115,FTI,"TechnipFMC plc (FTI  -  Free Report) reported first-quarter 2018 earnings on a diluted basis (excluding one-time items) of 28 cents a share, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 32 cents. The weaker-than-expected results can be primarily attributed to lower-than-anticipated operating profit in its Subsea segment. Precisely, the operating income in its Subsea segment amounted to $54.4 million, lagging the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $80 million.However, the bottom line was higher than the year-ago adjusted earnings of 26 cents a share on higher year-over-year profits, mainly in its Surface Technologies and Onshore/Offshore segments.Revenues in the first quarter came in at $3,125.2 million, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3,110 million. However, revenues in the quarter under review decreased 7.7% from the prior-year figure of $3,388 million.TechnipFMC plc Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  TechnipFMC plc Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | TechnipFMC plc QuoteSegmental AnalysisSubsea: The segment’s revenues in the first quarter were $1,180.2 million, reflecting a decrease of 14.3% from the year-ago figure of $1,376.7 million. Reduced project activities in Africa resulted in the weaker results. However, operating profit came in at $54.4 million, up 0.4% year over year due to synergistic benefits of the merger between Technip S.A. and FMC Technologies, completed last January.Onshore/Offshore: This segment generated revenues of $1,573.4 million, down 10.8% from the prior-year quarter. Revenues declined due to the completion of some key projects including Yamal LNG project, partly offset by increased activities in the Middle East, Europe and Asia Pacific regions. However, operating income rose to $202.9 million versus $142.8 million recorded in the first quarter of 2017 on strong project execution.Surface Technologies: The segment’s revenues in the first quarter were $371.6 million, up 49.6% from first-quarter 2017 figure of $248.4 million. The increase is primarily attributed to the rising momentum in the North American market and increased demand for hydraulic fracturing. Further, higher global activity levels and rebounding prices in North America helped the company report operating profit of $30.6 million against operating loss of $18.6 million incurred a year ago.BacklogAs of Mar 31, 2018, TechnipFMC’s total backlog was $14,012 million compared with $16,056.2 million a year ago, reflecting a decline of 12.7%.

1118,FTI,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for TechnipFMC plc (FTI  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 5% in that time frame.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is FTI due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.First-Quarter 2018 ResultsTechnipFMC reported first-quarter 2018 earnings on a diluted basis (excluding one-time items) of 28 cents a share, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 32 cents. The weaker-than-expected results can be primarily attributed to lower-than-anticipated operating profit in its Subsea segment. Precisely, the operating income in its Subsea segment amounted to $54.4 million, lagging the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $80 million.However, the bottom line was higher than the year-ago adjusted earnings of 26 cents a share on higher year-over-year profits, mainly in its Surface Technologies and Onshore/Offshore segments.Revenues in the first quarter came in at $3,125.2 million, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3,110 million. However, revenues in the quarter under review decreased 7.7% from the prior-year figure of $3,388 million.Segmental AnalysisSubsea: The segment’s revenues in the first quarter were $1,180.2 million, reflecting a decrease of 14.3% from the year-ago figure of $1,376.7 million. Reduced project activities in Africa resulted in the weaker results. However, operating profit came in at $54.4 million, up 0.4% year over year due to synergistic benefits of the merger between Technip S.A. and FMC Technologies, completed last January.Onshore/Offshore: This segment generated revenues of $1,573.4 million, down 10.8% from the prior-year quarter. Revenues declined due to the completion of some key projects including Yamal LNG project, partly offset by increased activities in the Middle East, Europe and Asia Pacific regions. However, operating income rose to $202.9 million versus $142.8 million recorded in the first quarter of 2017 on strong project execution.Surface Technologies: The segment’s revenues in the first quarter were $371.6 million, up 49.6% from first-quarter 2017 figure of $248.4 million. The increase is primarily attributed to the rising momentum in the North American market and increased demand for hydraulic fracturing. Further, higher global activity levels and rebounding prices in North America helped the company report operating profit of $30.6 million against operating loss of $18.6 million incurred a year ago.BacklogAs of Mar 31, 2018, TechnipFMC’s total backlog was $14,012 million compared with $16,056.2 million a year ago, reflecting a decline of 12.7%. Of this, backlog for Onshore/Offshore was $7,491.6 million, while Subsea and Surface Technologies backlogs were $6,110.9 million and $409.5 million, respectively.Capex & Balance SheetIn the reported quarter, TechnipFMC spent $53.2 million on capital programs. As of Mar 31, the company had cash and cash equivalents of $6,220.6 million and long-term debt of $3,735.8 million, with a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 22%.DividendThe board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 13 cents per share, payable on Jun 6, 2018 to its shareholders of record as of May 22, 2018.GuidanceTechnipFMC projects revenues for Onshore/Offshore segment to be within the range of $5.3-$5.7 billion in 2018, with an EBITDA margin of 11.5%, up from the prior guidance of 10.5%. The Surface Technologies segment is expected to generate revenues between $1.5 billion and $1.6 billion, with EBITDA margin of 17.5%. The company estimates its subsea revenues to lie within $5-$5.3 billion, with EBITDA margin of 14%. Capex for 2018 is estimated to be around $300 million.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in fresh estimates. There have been three revisions higher for the current quarter compared to two lower.TechnipFMC plc Price and Consensus  TechnipFMC plc Price and Consensus | TechnipFMC plc QuoteVGM ScoresAt this time, FTI has a poor Growth Score of F.

Per the contract, TechnipFMC will carry out engineering, procurement, construction, installation and commissioning of the Pluto water handling module. The module will be installed on the Pluto Alpha Gas Production Platform, and provide water separation and treatment facilities, along with upgraded power-generation units.Located offshore Western Australia, the gas produced from Pluto facility will be transferred to the Pluto LNG Offshore Plant. The Pluto offshore facility is chiefly operated by Woodside Petroleum, with 90% stake. The other partners in the project include Kansai Electric and Tokyo Gas, each carrying 5% stake. While the value of the contract is kept under wraps, it reinforces the close association of TechnipFMC with Woodside Petroleum, one of the major oil and gas operators in Australia.  Notably, this inbound order had been included in TechnipFMC’s onshore/offshore segment along with Energean Karish Project offshore Israel in the last earnings report. With recovering crude strength, TechnipFMC looks poised to boost backlog, revenues and profitability in its offshore segment, which is primarily responsible for design, manufacture and installation of fixed and floating platforms, for producing and processing oil and gas reserves.In fact, the inbound order in the onshore/offshore segment (accounting for 53% of the total inbound orders) in the last reported quarter stood at $1850 million, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,412 million. The revenues of $1,573 million from the segment also surpassed the estimates of $1,536 million.

1120,FTI,"TechnipFMC plc (FTI  -  Free Report) recently secured a contract from CNOOC Limited (CEO  -  Free Report) to support the Liuhua development project in the South Sea China. The engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contract clinched by TechnipFMC will require the company to design, procure and construct a subsea system. This will comprise twenty units of enhanced horizontal subsea tree, along with control systems, wellheads, manifolds and intervention workover control systems. The contract also entails installation and commissioning services, along with providing local services support base in China.The contract reinforces the close association of TechnipFMC with CNOOC, which is one of the major oil and gas exploration companies in China. The value of the contract has not been disclosed yet, however the EPC award further boosts TechnipFMC’s presence in China.Notably, the subsea segment, which was once the largest and fastest growing unit of TechnipFMC, has been facing challenges in its revenues over the past few quarters, amid a volatile pricing scenario. In fact, the subsea revenues witnessed a sequential decline in each of the trailing four quarters. However, with the massive recovery in crude prices of late, many energy companies are slowly increasing their spending on the upstream projects, translating into more contracts for the oilfield service providers like TechnipFMC.Concurrently, the subsea orders of the company have gradually started building up. In fact, in the last reported quarter, the company’s subsea segment secured new orders worth $1.2 billion, including contracts from Energean Oil & Gas, Sabah Shell Petroleum Company Ltd and LLOG Exploration for the Karish field development project, Gumusut-Kakap phase 2 project and Who Dat field in Mexico, respectively. Total subsea backlog of TechnipFMC stood at more than $6.1 billion as of Mar 31, 2018.Notably, with its Subsea 2.0 platform, along with multiple new product technologies and integration activities, the company remains confident that the subsea orders are likely to gain traction in 2018 and witness continued growth in 2019. In the next couple of years, the company anticipates huge subsea opportunities in projects like Liza Phase 2 and Golfinho, Zinia, Vito, and Johan Sverdrup, Bonga SW among others.Zacks Rank and Key PicksTechnipFMC currently carries Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).TechnipFMC plc Price  TechnipFMC plc Price | TechnipFMC plc QuoteSome better-ranked players within the same industry include Nine Energy Service, Inc.

1121,FTI,"TechnipFMC plc (FTI  -  Free Report) is anticipated to beat earnings estimates in first-quarter 2018 results, after the closing bell on May 9.While the company missed earnings estimates in the last reported quarter amid weak contribution from its Subsea segment, results are expected to improve this earnings season.TechnipFMC plc Price and EPS Surprise  TechnipFMC plc Price and EPS Surprise | TechnipFMC plc QuoteWhy a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model also shows that TechnipFMC is likely to beat earnings estimates in the to-be-reported quarter because it has the right combination of the two key ingredients.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for this company is +13.92%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate of 37 cents is pegged higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 32 cents. A favorable Zacks ESP serves as a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: TechnipFMC carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which when combined with a positive ESP, makes us confident of an earnings beat.Note that stocks with a Zacks Ranks #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating estimates. Conversely, Sell-rated stocks (#4 and 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.What is Driving the Better-Than-Expected Earnings?A leading manufacturer and supplier of technology solutions for the energy industry, TechnipFMC — whose peers include Core Laboratories N.V. (CLB  -  Free Report) and Baker Hughes among others — offers subsea, surface, onshore, and offshore solutions for oil and gas projects.With the U.S. rig count falling to record levels in 2016, the oilfield services players were hit hard. Unprecedented declines in activity levels and a sharp fall in upstream spending led to lower revenues and pricing headwinds. However, with commodity prices improving and drilling activities picking up, the market for oilfield services companies is on the mend.Per EIA data, the commodity rose about 7.5% in the first three months of 2018 to finish the quarter at $64.87 per barrel. In fact, the first quarter of the year saw the U.S. oil benchmark attain its highest settlement since December 2014, despite a record high domestic production. Crude was supported by various catalysts including strong demand, and continued production curb from OPEC and its allies. The recovering commodity market calls for higher investments from oil majors and increasing demand for drilling activities, translating into more contracts for companies like TechnipFMC.Importantly, relentless cost reductions combined with excellent project execution are likely to enable the company deliver year-over-year operating profits across its segments.Evidently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Subsea segment’s operating profit for the to-be-reported quarter stands at $80 million compared with $54.2 million recorded in the first quarter of 2017. Adjusted EBITDA for the Onshore/Offshore segment is expected at $167 million, higher than the prior-year reported figure of $152.2 million. Rising momentum in the North American market is likely to boost revenues for the Surface Technologies to $373 million compared with $248.4 million sales recorded in the year-ago quarter. Further, on a more encouraging note, the Surface Technologies segment is expected to turnaround from an operating loss of $18.6 million in the year-ago quarter to report earnings of $53 million in the first quarter of 2018, on the back of a favorable product mix and leaner cost structure.Other Energy Stocks Poised for a BeatTechnipFMC is not the only energy firm looking up this earnings season. Here are some other companies within the energy space, which according to our model also have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in the to-be-reported quarter:Leading energy transporter and distributor, Enbridge Inc. (ENB  -  Free Report) carries a Zacks Rank #3 and has an Earnings ESP of +5.88%. The company is slated to release results on May 10.Independent oil and gas explorer Lilis Energy Inc.

The weak results can be attributed to lower revenues mainly due to reduced project activities in Europe and Africa, partially offset by increased activities in North America.Revenues in the third quarter came in at $4,141 million beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3,890 million. Revenues in the quarter under review however, decreased from $5,038.2 million recorded in the year-ago quarter.TechnipFMC plc Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  TechnipFMC plc Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | TechnipFMC plc Quote Segmental AnalysisSubsea: The segment’s revenues for the third quarter were $1,478.2 million, reflecting a decrease of 37% from third-quarter 2016. Reduced project activities in Europe and Africa led to lower revenues. Operating profit came in at $102.8 million, down 71.3% year over year.Onshore/Offshore: This segment generated revenues of $2,308.1 million, down 3.8% year over year. Revenues declined due to the completion of several projects since the prior-year period, partly offset by the increased activities in the Middle East. However, operating income jumped 74% to $206.4 million on successful progression of several major projects.Surface Technologies: The segment’s revenues for the third quarter were $353.9 million, up 19.9% from third -quarter 2016 figure of $295.2 million. The increase is primarily attributed to the rising momentum in the North American as well as completion activity. However, a favorable product mix and a leaner cost structure helped the company to report an operating profit of $49 million as against an operating loss of $17.4 million incurred a year ago.BacklogAs of Sep 30, 2017, TechnipFMC’s total backlog was $13,902.4 million compared with $13,698.8 million a year ago.

1124,FTI,"It was a week where both oil and gas prices logged gains.On the news front, oilfield service majors Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB  -  Free Report) and Halliburton Co. (HAL  -  Free Report) kicked off the energy earnings season. Importantly, both companies indicated that activity in North America remain strong. Meanwhile, Swiss rig behemoth Transocean Ltd. (RIG  -  Free Report) received a new contract award for one of its ultra-deepwater drillships.Overall, it was a good week for the sector. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures edged up about 0.8% to close at $51.84 per barrel, while natural gas prices gained 1.5% to $2.915 per million Btu (MMBtu). (See the last ‘Oil & Gas Stock Roundup’ here: RDS.A Buys EV Charging Network, CVX Cancels Australia Drilling Plan.)The U.S. oil benchmark registered a modest climb after the U.S. Energy Department's inventory release showed that crude stockpiles fell for the fourth straight week.The bullish impact from the crude inventory draw was supported by other developments including mounting tensions between Iraq and Kurdistan near the oil-rich city of Kirkuk, President Trump’s decision not to certify Iran’s compliance with the nuclear deal, and a falling U.S. rig count.However, the gains were kept in check by concerns over a new wave of domestic shale oil production that continues to be the biggest headwind for the market.Meanwhile, natural gas futures finished higher following an in-line increase in supplies. Current stocks – at 3.646 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) – are now 35 Bcf (1%) under the five-year average, while dropping 179 Bcf (4.7%) below the year-ago figure.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    The world’s largest oilfield services provider, Schlumberger Ltd., reported third-quarter 2017 earnings of 42 cents per share (excluding charges and credits), in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate and higher than the year-ago figure of 25 cents.The strong results were driven by solid demand for directional drilling in the North American land market. This was partially offset by major project completions in Mexico and Iraq, where the company wrapped up major service contracts.The oilfield service player expects activity in North America – where Schlumberger has a significant client base – to continue growing but cautioned that the rate might slow down from previous quarters on account of flattening rig count.As of Sep 30, 2017, the company had approximately $4,952 million in cash and short-term investments and $15,871 million in long-term debt. This represents a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 30%. In the July-to-September quarter, the company bought back 1.5 million shares. (Read more: Schlumberger Posts In-Line Q3 Earnings, Revenues Miss.)2.    Smaller rival Halliburton Co. reported better-than-expected third quarter profit thanks to improved utilization and pricing gains in North America – the company’s largest market by sales. Halliburton’s income from continuing operation came in at 42 cents per share, above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 38 cents – the thirteenth consecutive quarterly outperformance. Moreover, revenues of $5,444 million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5,318.9 million.Along the results, Halliburton also sounded optimistic in its view that the North American land market is improving rapidly, driven by increased utilization and pricing - particularly for pressure pumping. As it is, rig counts have generally been rising during the last one and half years since plunging to an all-time low of 404 in May 2016, with the addition of a flood of new units. As a proof of the recovery, Halliburton grew its domestic land revenue by 14% sequentially, well ahead of the U.S. land rig count growth of 6%.Additionally, Halliburton’s international market proved resilient in the face of challenging circumstances. The company’s impressive expense management for the last several quarters helped regional sales rising more than 4% from the second quarter. (Read more North American Strength Drives Halliburton Q3 Earnings)3.    Offshore driller Transocean Ltd. recently reported that its ultra-deepwater drillship Deepwater Invictus has received a two-year contract from a subsidiary of mining company, BHP Billiton Limited (BHP  -  Free Report). Per Transocean, the contract will begin in the second quarter of 2018.The contract for Deepwater Invictus, which joined Transocean's fleet in 2014, includes three one-year priced options. Transocean expects the backlog related to the contract to be around $106 million. The Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company is yet to declare the exact dayrates for the rig.

1125,FTI,"Oilfield services company TechnipFMC plc (FTI  -  Free Report) is set to release third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 25, after the closing bell.A leading manufacturer and supplier of technology solutions for the energy industry, TechnipFMC offers subsea, surface, onshore and offshore solutions for oil and gas projects.In the prior quarter, the London-based company reported better-than-expected earnings on the back of steady project executions, achievement of key milestones, efficiencies from its industry-leading solutions and cost-reduction efforts. FMC Technologies, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  FMC Technologies, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | FMC Technologies, Inc. QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to Consider Though oil prices have recovered from their historical lows, it still lingers around $50 per barrel, which is far below the breakeven price for many oil and gas firms. As a result, top energy companies continue to reduce spending and equipment suppliers like TechnipFMC struggle to protect its backlog amid the volatile price environment. For the third quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the total backlog order is pegged at $14,033 million as against $15,183 million reported in the prior quarter. The backlog for subsea technologies is anticipated at $1,080 million as against $1,773 million reported in second-quarter 2017.The company’s subsea revenues and margins are also expected to decline. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the revenues of the subsea segment is pegged at $1,612 million, lower than the $1,730 million recorded in the prior quarter. Operating profit for the energy infrastructure segment is expected to decline to $142 million compared with the preceding three-month period reported figure of $177 million.The company has already cautioned that 2017 would be difficult year with order growth set to remain weak. All these factors account for our bleak earnings outlook for the company in third-quarter 2017.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that TechnipFMC is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for the company is 0.00%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP FilterZacks Rank: TechnipFMC presently carries a Zacks Rank #4(Sell). Please note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Strong Sell) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these also have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Unit Corporation (UNT  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +29.17% and a Zacks Rank #3. The company is likely to release third-quarter earnings on Nov 3.RPC, Inc. (RES  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +4.89% and a Zacks Rank #2.

1128,FTI,"Oilfield services company TechnipFMC plc (FTI  -  Free Report) is set to release its second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 26, after the closing bell.A leading manufacturer and supplier of technology solutions for the energy industry, TechnipFMC offers subsea, surface, onshore and offshore solutions for oil and gas projects.In the preceding three-month period, the London-based company reported better-than-expected operating earnings on the back of strong project execution, efficiencies from its industry-leading solutions and cost-reduction efforts. Coming to its earnings surprise history, TechnipFMC reported a positive average earnings surprise of 46.88% for the trailing four quarters.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.TechnipFMC plc Price and EPS Surprise  TechnipFMC plc Price and EPS Surprise | TechnipFMC plc QuoteFactors to Consider This QuarterTechnipFMC is well positioned in the subsea systems market, which is its largest business in terms of revenue generation. The company boasts a strong backlog, which reflects steady demand from customers and allows it to navigate uncertainty better than many of its peers. During the quarter, TechnipFMC was awarded a number of contracts including a three-year well intervention contract in Australia, an integrated EPCI deal from Statoil ASA , Liza subsea equipment contract from Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM  -  Free Report) and the Coral south FLNG Project. These are likely to drive the company’s earnings and cash flow. The FLNG contract will further strengthen its position in the floating LNG market.Further, the rising rig count and activity levels in North America enhance the company’s prospects for the current quarter. Also, President Trump’s exit from the Paris Climate accord provided an impetus to drilling activities.We also appreciate TechnipFMC’s successful cost-management initiatives and excellent project execution in the wake of weak oil prices. The merger between FMC Technologies and Technip SA completed in Jan 2017 is also expected to result in substantial savings which are likely to strengthen the company’s financials. The merger has also created opportunities by offering unique integrated offshore project solutions.However, weak oil and gas prices might mar demand for oilfield services. During the second quarter, oil and natural gas prices declined 8.4% and 5%, respectively. Lower commodity prices might lead to reduced exploration and production activities. This could call for lower investments by oil majors which will impact revenues of oilfield service companies. This is also reflected in the share price of Halliburton which witnessed a decline of around 14% in the second quarter. This is also reflected in the share price of TechnipFMC which witnessed a decline of around 16.3% in the second quarter.TechnipFMC plc Price  TechnipFMC plc Price | TechnipFMC plc QuoteEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that TechnipFMC is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter.
