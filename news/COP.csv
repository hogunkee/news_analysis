3,COP,"A man with a long-standing beef against the Annapolis, Maryland, newspaper Capital Gazette entered the paper's headquarters with a shotgun and murdered five staffers. It represents the deadliest attack on U.S. reporters in modern history.Before learning about the suspect's mental issues and his long-standing feud with the newspaper, some in the media blamed President Donald Trump. After all, critics said, Trump routinely denounces ""fake news"" as an existential threat to our republic. Connect the dots, they said. Blame Trump! CNN aired a montage of Trump's attacks on the media. Rob Cox, a Reuters editor, tweeted: ""This is what happens when @RealDonaldTrump calls journalists the enemy of the people. Blood is on your hands, Mr. President."" Another reporter, who later resigned, even falsely tweeted that the shooter was wearing a MAGA cap. How do you get that wrong?How dare the President call out the anti-Republican media for its decades of biased reporting? Pew Research, in 2013, found that only 7% of reporters called themselves Republican. How dare Trump attack The New York Times, which has not endorsed a Republican presidential candidate since 1956? How dare Trump go after The Washington Post, which has never endorsed a Republican presidential candidate. And how dare Trump refer to CNN — one of whose ""news"" anchors, Don Lemon, has called Trump ""a racist"" — as fake news.Did the media hold President Barack Obama responsible for the murders of 10 cops in Dallas, Baton Rouge and New York City, all at the hands of black men apparently incited by their belief that cops murder blacks without consequence? After all, Obama frequently criticized the police and bemoaned America's racism as ""part of our DNA.""President Obama's anti-cop rhetoric started right after he took office. Obama's friend, a black Harvard professor, was arrested in his home. Professor Henry Louis Gates, back from a trip, couldn't open his front door and reportedly asked his driver to help. A neighbor, observing two people trying to force open the front door of Gates' home, called 911. But when the cops arrived and asked Gates to exit the home so he could determine its ownership, Gates mouthed off and was briefly arrested. Obama said, ""The Cambridge police acted stupidly."" The Cambridge Police Superior Officers Association and the Cambridge Police commissioner insisted the officer followed protocol. Obama's statement infuriated officers all across the country and set up a template for the Obama administration: Cops engage in unlawful anti-black racial profiling.Obama and his attorney general also offered verbal support to the so-called Black Lives Matter movement that argues, without facts, that blacks are regularly and illegally profiled by an institutionally, systemically and structurally ""racist"" criminal justice system. It did not help that during the first six years of the Obama administration, the anti-police incendiary Rev. Al Sharpton, according to The Washington Post, visited the White House 72 times. What kind of message did that send to the police?Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseWhen a Sanford, Florida, neighborhood watch captain, George Zimmerman, shot and killed a black 17-year-old named Trayvon Martin, President Obama promptly sided with the deceased teen, saying, ""If I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon."" A jury found Zimmerman not guilty, and one juror later said that during the deliberations, race never came up.Then there's Ferguson. A grim President Obama, at an address before the United Nations, said: ""In a summer marked by instability in the Middle East and Eastern Europe, I know the world also took notice of the small American city of Ferguson, Missouri — where a young man was killed, and a community was divided. So yes, we have our own racial and ethnic tensions.""But the Ferguson grand jury did not indict the officer who shot and killed Michael Brown, and a Department of Justice report exonerated the cop. Contrary to the lies told by his friend who witnessed the shooting, Michael Brown did not have his hands up when the officer shot and killed him. Brown, did not say, ""Hands up. Don't shoot."" Yet before the investigation even began, Obama's BFF, Sharpton, took to the streets of Ferguson yelling, ""No justice, no peace.""The DOJ's investigation of Ferguson's nearly all-white police department criticized its alleged ""institutional racism."" But its actual findings do not support that conclusion. Ferguson, the investigation noted, is 67% black, but 85% of its traffic stops involve black drivers. To the DOJ, this 18-point statistical imbalance equals systemic racism. But in New York City, where the department consists mostly officers of color, 55% of traffic stops involve a black driver in a city with a 25% black population. This is a 30-point statistical imbalance. Wouldn't this make the NYPD even more ""institutionally racist"" than the Ferguson PD?Trump, say the media, has created an atmosphere that puts reporters in danger. Obama often unfairly criticized the police. But the media did not blame Obama for the murder of officers by angry black men consumed with the wrongheaded belief that blacks are victimized by the ""institutional racism"" of the criminal justice system.More Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

19,COP,"Exxon Mobil (XOM) said it would focus on boosting shareholder value after missing earnings views for a second straight quarter Friday, as output slipped despite the recent surge in oil prices, while Chevron (CVX) topped profit forecasts.XExxon is focused on ""growing shareholder value"" as its first priority, then on investments and raising the dividend, before looking at share buybacks, said Jeff Woodbury, head of investor relations, during the company's first-quarter earnings call.But he added that buybacks ""remain on the table"" and will be looked at on a quarter-to-quarter basis.In the earnings release, the company also said it doesn't plan to use buybacks to reduce outstanding shares but will buy shares to offset dilution related to benefit plans and programs.With crude prices at the highest levels in more than three years, hopes have been higher that oil companies will return more capital to shareholders after years of being cautious with cash.But on Thursday Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) reported its highest profit since oil prices were above $100 a barrel, but declined to say when a planned $25 billion-$30 billion buyback would start and instead prioritized debt reduction.Exxon's cash flow from operations and asset sales rose 12.4% in Q1 to $9.96 billion, the highest since 2014. But earnings still disappointed, as EPS rose 14.7% to $1.09, missing analyst views by 5 cents. Revenue rose 7.8% to $68.2 billion, beating views for $66.07 billion.Oil-equivalent production fell 6% to 3.9 million barrels per day, the weakest Q1 tally since its 1999 merger. Adjusted production slipped 3%. Upstream revenue jumped 55% to $3.497 billion while downstream revenue fell nearly 16% to $940 million. Capital expenditures rose 16.7% to $4.867 billion.Exxon now has 27 rigs in the Permian Basin and four in the Bakken, with production up 18% in the two plays year over year.Woodbury said Exxon has made ""great progress"" in tight oil and the 27 rigs in the Permian is ahead of Exxon's schedule to have 30 rigs in the prolific basin by end of the year.The company hasn't seen any pipeline bottlenecks in the Permian. ""We are clearing all of our Permian barrels,"" Woodbury said.Exxon Mobil shares fell 3.8% to close at 77.79 on the stock market today.

Excluding working capital, cash flow from operations jumped 48% to $7.1 billion. Capital and exploratory expenditures were flat at $4.4 billion.""Our cash flow continues to increase with the powerful combination of expanding upstream margins and volumes,"" Chairman and CEO Michael Wirth said in a statement.

Start HerePhillips 66, a spinoff of ConocoPhillips' (COP) downstream business, is in the midst of streamlining its portfolio of assets.Zacks analysts expect Phillips 66 to focus on more profitable midstream operations and its chemicals business, rather than refining and marketing.Not only are crude prices at multiyear highs, but the Brent crude premium to U.S. crude has widened to nearly $7. That's good news for U.S.-based refiners, which pay for cheaper U.S. crude but sell gasoline and refined products at the global price, which reflects Brent crude input costs.Earlier this year, Buffett described the Houston-based refiner as ""a great company"" with diversified downstream assets and a strong management team. The Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) chairman and CEO made those remarks as he sold 35 million shares back to the refiner for $3.3 billion.Buffett explained the transaction was ""solely motivated"" by a desire to avoid regulatory headaches that come with ownership levels above 10%.He remains a large shareholder and plans to hold Phillips 66 stock for the long term.The stock bears a 2.6% yield, making it one of many dividend stocks in the Oracle of Omaha's portfolio.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Exxon Mobil Earnings Miss Views; Chevron Revenue LightAmerica's Black Gold Goes Platinum: What It Means For This Hot Energy StockConocoPhillips Crushes Earnings ViewsHow To Invest In Stocks For Free: New Apps Aim For BeginnersEnergy Stocks And Industry News: Oil, Gas, Solar, CoalWarren Buffett Stocks: These Are The Top Berkshire Hathaway Holdings; Apple Pops

24,COP,"ConocoPhillips (COP) had its Relative Strength (RS) Rating upgraded from 63 to 72 Tuesday -- a welcome improvement, but still short of the 80 or better score you prefer to see. X IBD's unique RS Rating identifies technical performance by using a 1 (worst) to 99 (best) score that identifies how a stock's price performance over the trailing 52 weeks matched up against all other stocks. History reveals that the best stocks typically have an RS Rating north of 80 in the early stages of their moves. See if ConocoPhillips can continue to rebound and hit that benchmark. Looking For Winning Stocks? Try This Simple RoutineWhile ConocoPhillips is not near an ideal buy zone right now, see if it is able to form and break out from a proper base.Earnings grew 273% last quarter, up from 0% in the prior report. Revenue also increased, from 10% to 20%. ConocoPhillips holds the No. 2 rank among its peers in the Oil & Gas-International Exploration & Production industry group.

25,COP,"How can technology and oil stocks mix? One way: When high-quality companies from both sectors rise to new highs.ConocoPhillips (COP) and new IPO Dropbox (DBX) lead a still modest yet growing cadre of companies that burst to 52-week or all-time new highs Thursday. The latter is trying to break out of its first base; the former is trying to pad its gains after a successful breakout from an early-stage base.Dropbox, whose service allows users to access and edit files from multiple computers or internet-enabled devices, burst past a 34.47 buy point in a very narrow IPO base. That base began forming after the stock reversed sharply March 29. The IPO base formed over a period of just eight sessions, far fewer days than the typical successful IPO base.Analysts see the San Francisco-based firm earnings 2 cents a share in the first quarter. It lost 8 cents a share in Q1 and Q2 of 2017 and 4 cents in Q3 and 10 cents in Q4.Revenue jumped 33%, 33%, 30% and 28% vs. year-ago levels in the past four quarters.The company priced 36 million shares at 21 a share in late March.Oil and gas giant ConocoPhillips rose to as high as 63.88, extending gains from a 61.41 entry in a cup without handle to 4%. This means shares are still in buy range. Don't chase a stock more than 5% past the proper buy point.The cup without handle is most visible on a daily chart. But in looking at a weekly chart, it appears that a one-week handle also formed. That ushers in a slightly lower buy point of 61.27, 10 cents above the highest price during last week's action.An earlier Stock Market Today column covered Conoco's breakout in detail Wednesday.Elsewhere, apparel firms are gaining more steam.Business apparel, casual clothing and footwear giant PVH (PVH) moved further past a 158.06 buy point in an excellent flat base. On Thursday, shares reached as high as 162.62, up almost 3%.While volume is running roughly flat vs. the stock's 50-day average turnover, check out its daily chart. Since a March 29 bullish gap up in price, PVH had already registered five significant up days in heavy volume.Such action points to rising institutional demand.The reasons are clear. The owner of the Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger apparel brands is showing a fresh streak of top and bottom line growth.Earnings fell vs. year-ago levels in the final two quarters of fiscal 2017, ended in January that year. Then PVH grew its earnings per share by 10%, 15%, 16% and 28% in the next four quarters. In the April-ending fiscal first quarter for this year, the Street sees profit accelerating 36% higher to $2.25 a share.Sales grew 4%, 7%, 5% and 19% in the past four quarters, and are seen rising 15% in the current period to $2.28 billion.Global sports apparel and shoe maker Adidas (ADDYY) rallied as much as 2% and hit as high as 129.81 in afternoon trading Thursday. Shares are now up 11% past a 116.94 buy point in a long saucer with handle. Analysts expect profit to jump 94% to $7.78 a share this year, which would be the highest in at least eight years.(Please follow Saito-Chung on Twitter at @IBD_DChung for more commentary on growth stocks, breakouts, and financial markets.)RELATED:All About The Saucer With HandleThe Latest Inside Investor's CornerHow To Properly Track The Stock Market Direction?

At an economic forum in China, President Xi Jinping said he would work hard to increase U.S. imports into China.The Washington Post reported that Xi merely repeated previous promises to cut tariffs, ease restrictions on foreign investment and toughen protection for intellectual property.Xi's comments could provide President Trump with either a face-saving exit or at least an opportunity to lower the harsh volume. As of midday Tuesday, Trump had not yet tweeted a response to Xi's remarks.Stocks have had trouble digesting Trump's tariff talk, but Tuesday's market found a smooth groove.Boeing and Goldman Sachs advanced about 3% each but remained under their 50-day moving averages. Exxon Mobil also popped 3% but retook its diving 50-day line.Analysts expect Exxon to grow earnings 33% this year. Boeing is expected to step up earnings 17% this year.

The Dow transports gained 1.2%, even as West Texas Intermediate near-term crude oil futures soared more than 3%.The Nasdaq composite gained around 1.8%, helped by a solid rebound in semiconductor equipment, fabless semiconductors, data storage and automakers including Nasdaq-listed electric car pioneer Tesla (TSLA).

Privacy Policy & Terms of UseConocoPhillips (COP) is leading the way, rising more than 3% to 62.85 and moving past a 61.41 entry in heavy volume. It normally trades 7.07 million shares a day.Conoco formed a cup without handle, which can still lead to tremendous gains in a limited time period. The stock pulled back at the end of March in a positive way, but it did not meet the five-day minimum requirement for any handle.The handle represents the last rash of selling by less committed investors before a stock sets up a potential breakout to new highs.Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) gapped up at the open and rose more than 3% to 68.34 in fierce turnover. A nearly three-month cup is in the works, and the stock is now bullishly above the 50-day moving average.Notice on a daily chart how Shell's RS line has burst into new high ground, a sign of strong outperformance vs. the S&P 500.Other commodity-based companies that are rising sharply in heavy turnover include Alcoa (AA) and Schnitzer Steel (SCHN), as covered in IBD's Stocks On The Move table. This screen helps investors quickly build a watch list of stocks that are showing strong gains and potentially building bases before breaking out.Schnitzer lifted more than 2% to 32 but remains wedged in between its falling 50-day moving average and its rising long-term 200-day line.A base is useful for all growth investors because it gives leading stocks a chance to rest and digest prior gains, flush out weak shareholders, work their way back near 52-week highs, then break out to new highs to lead the market higher. Each base offers a distinct buy point; don't buy until it surpasses the proper entry, ideally in robust turnover.(Please follow Saito-Chung on Twitter at @IBD_DChung for more analysis and commentary on growth stocks and financial markets.)RELATED:Which Stocks Are Breaking Out?

28,COP,"Energy is perhaps beginning to gain a larger presence in IBD's new highs list, be it oil and gas or alternatives such as solar energy. And SolarEdge Technologies (SEDG) and ConocoPhillips (COP) are making some noise in the form of sharp new highs.SolarEdge cleared a narrow, tight consolidation as shares got as high as 59.20, up 4.7%, before retreating. Despite the reversal, gains for the week are still robust.Notice on a weekly chart how the expert in inverters, which turn photovoltaic power into usable electricity, has not touched its 10-week moving average since its breakout during the week ended Feb. 16. A first or second test of the 10-week line usually presents a lower-risk opportunity to add shares to a winning position in the stock.So, what can you do when the stock refuses to come close to even pricking the 10-week moving average?For aggressive investors, one suggestion is to engage in an advanced buying technique. In SolarEdge's case, a move past 58.30, 10 cents above the March 27 peak, in strong volume offers a place to add a very small number of shares. Never buy the same amount as you normally would at a proper breakout point. The reason? To avoid your overall cost per share from running up too fast.This advanced follow-on entry point is based on the method that IBD founder Bill O'Neil used to find ways to buy more shares in some of his biggest stock market winners, including Pic N Save (now known as Big Lots (BIG)) and Amgen (AMGN). After a stock wages a strong run-up, find a period of two to four weeks in which the stock does not fall much and trades relatively tight. Volume should be dull. Then buy as the stock clears the highest price within such a narrow consolidation.In the case of SolarEdge, the stock fell 0.8% and 2.6% during the final two weeks of March. Those are paltry declines compared with the 37% ascent achieved in the prior five weeks. Plus, volume shrank below average during both of those down weeks.SolarEdge is No. 1 in the IBD 50.On Feb. 15, the stock catapulted past a 39.75 buy point in a somewhat stretched-out double bottom. In this key chart pattern, the stock makes two lows, and the second low must undercut the first one.SolarEdge passes this test as the 30.80 low easily went below the first low of 32.90 seen on Dec. 1. Add 10 cents to the middle peak in between the lows to mark the proper buy point.ConocoPhillips, meanwhile is busting out of a nine-week cup with a 61.41 entry. At midday, volume was running bullishly strong, 61% above usual levels. No proper handle was formed, so one can find the buy point by adding 10 cents to the cup's left-side peak.The 5% buy zone goes up to 64.48.The Houston-based member of IBD's international oil and gas E&P group is expected to earn $2.78 a share in 2018, up 363% from 2017 and the biggest profits since 2014, when it earned $5.30 a share. The large-cap firm has significant interests in the North Atlantic waters and Norway, as well as in the Asian-Pacific region.Wall Street sees Conoco's revenue growing 14% to $8.88 billion in the first quarter of this year and 8% overall in 2018 to $35.11 billion.On Tuesday, West Texas intermediate crude oil prices rose 3.1% to $65.39 a barrel and are up 8% year to date.HollyFrontier (HFC) — maker of diesel, jet fuel and other light derivatives from petroleum — raced into new high ground Tuesday.

30,COP,"With oil logging surging to multiyear highs, energy stocks have been leading the S&P 500 index and the broader market. Here are five energy stocks with compelling chart action: ConocoPhillips (COP), Valero Energy (VLO), Hollyfrontier (HFC), Wildhorse Resource (WRD) and Viper Energy Partners (VNOM).U.S. crude rose 0.5% Friday to settle at $67.39 a barrel, marking a weekly gain of 8.6% and hitting the highest level since late 2014. Brent crude gained 0.8% to $72.58 a barrel for a weekly increase of 8.2%.U.S. crude futures fell 1.7% to $66.22 a barrel on Monday as investors saw Syria tensions contained following U.S.-led airstrikes on Saturday. If oil prices retreat significantly, crude-related stocks will struggle to advance or even maintain current levels.But the five stocks cited here continued to rally.Small-cap shale play Viper Energy, a subsidiary of Diamondback Energy (FANG) leads the group with a near-best Composite Rating of 98. Wildhorse Resource, another shale play, earns a 97. ConocoPhillips and Hollyfrontier each have a 96 while Valero has a 94.ConocoPhilips, Valero, Hollyfrontier, Wildhorse and Viper Energy all have relative strength lines at record highs, reflecting these energy stocks' outperformance of the S&P 500 index.Wildhorse and Valero are presenting potential buying opportunities.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseValero Energy broke out of a consolidation base with a 100.05 buy point on Wednesday, though the volume was light. Still, shares popped 3.6% to 105.49, hitting a new high and now extended from that entry.Wildhorse Resource cleared a 21.53 buy point from a cup base on Thursday. Shares sprinted 6% to 23.44, now clearly extended.Wildhorse has an especially bullish RS line. Not only is the RS line at new high ground now, but it was at a new high before the stock hit a new price high. Wildhorse came public in December 2016.The three other energy stocks, ConocoPhillips, Viper Energy Partners and Hollyfrontier, are now further extended from buy range. While you never want to chase a stock more than 5% past a buy point, many leaders will pull back into buy range. Keep in mind, however, that you want to see light volume on the pullback, rather than rapid selling.ConocoPhillips rose 1.3% on Monday to 65.73, further extended from a 61.41 buy point cleared several sessions ago.Viper Energy Partners cleared a 26.29 entry point on April 5, becoming extended on Friday. Shares rose 2% to 28.71 on Monday. It also has a strong RS line. Parent company Diamondback has been trending lower since an attempted breakout in late March that ultimately failed.Hollyfrontier is continuing to rise steadily since its April 4 breakout from a cup-with-handle base with a 50.60 buy point. Shares jumped 2.6% to 57.16 on Monday. You never want to see a double-digit gain disappear, so if Hollyfrontier pulls back, be careful about round-tripping.Meanwhile, BP (BP) is at 42.72, in a cup-shaped base with a buy point at 44.72.

On Friday, the stock hit a new high of 65, up as much as 6% past the proper entry point.Energen (EGN) and Anadarko Petroleum (APC) also had good runs, each rising about 7% for the week. The former has rallied nicely since moving past a 58.04 buy point in a 10-week cup with handle. The latter is trying to clear a 63.15 buy point in a long saucer with handle. Analysts see Anadarko earning $1.59 a share in 2018, which would end three years' of net losses.RELATED:Which Stocks Entered And Left IBD's Key Stock Screens?

That capacity represents the industry's safety cushion in the event of unexpected outages.

48,COP,"A new study on racial disparities in police conduct found that differences in offending by suspects — not racism — explains officers' responses.In the study ""Is There Evidence of Racial Disparity in Police Use of Deadly Force?"" professors from Michigan State and Arizona State universities analyzed officer-involved fatal shootings in 2015 and 2016.The report's abstract says:""We benchmark two years of fatal shooting data on 16 crime rate estimates. When adjusting for crime, we find no systematic evidence of anti-black disparities in fatal shootings, fatal shootings of unarmed citizens, or fatal shootings involving misidentification of harmless objects. ... Exposure to police given crime rate differences likely accounts for the higher per capita rate of fatal police shootings for blacks, at least when analyzing all shootings. For unarmed shootings or misidentification shootings, data are too uncertain to be conclusive.""Two recent studies found cops more reluctant to use deadly force against blacks, including one by a black Harvard economist. Professor Roland G. Fryer Jr. concluded: ""On the most extreme use of force — officer-involved shootings — we find no racial differences in either the raw data or when contextual factors are taken into account.""But aren't blacks routinely ""racially profiled"" by cops? Not according to the Police-Public Contact Survey. Produced every three years by the Department of Justice's Bureau of Justice Statistics, the survey asks more than 60,000 people about their interactions with the police. It asks respondents' to provide age, race and gender. It asks them whether they had any contact with the police in the last year; what was the experience like; how were your treated; was there a use of force and so on.Turns out, according to a September 2017 National Review article, black men and white men are about equally likely to have a contact with a cop in a given year. As to multiple contacts, defined as three or more with the police in a given year, 1.5% of blacks vs. 1.2% of whites fall in that category. Not much difference.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThere's also the National Crime Victimization Survey, which questions victims of crimes, whether or not the criminal was captured, as to the race and ethnicity of the suspect. It turns out that the race of the arrested matches the percentage given by victims. So unless victims are lying about the race of their assailant, unconcerned about whether he gets caught, blacks are not being ""overarrested.""A reasonable discussion about blacks and police practices cannot take place without acknowledging the disproportion amount of crime committed by blacks. According to the Department of Justice's ""Felony Defendants in Large Urban Counties, 2009,"" in the country's 75 largest counties, blacks committed 62% of robberies, 45% of assaults and accounted for 57% of murder defendants.The No. 1 cause of preventable death for young white men is accidents, such as car accidents. The No. 1 cause of preventable death for young black men is homicide, usually committed by another young black man, not a cop. In 2016, according to the latest data from the FBI's Uniform Crime Report, 7,881 blacks were killed.The courageous Manhattan Institute's Heather Mac Donald, who writes extensively about police practice, asked:""Who is killing these black victims? Not whites, and not the police, but other blacks. In 2016, the police fatally shot 233 blacks, the vast majority armed and dangerous. ... Contrary to the Black Lives Matter narrative, the police have much more to fear from black males than black males have to fear from the police. In 2015, a police officer was 18.5 times more likely to be killed by a black male than an unarmed black male was to be killed by a police officer.""In 2012 in the city of Rialto, California, population approximately 100,000, cops were randomly assigned body cameras based on their shifts. Over the next year, use-of-force incidents on the shifts that had cameras were half the rate of those without cameras. But something rather extraordinary also happened. Complaints against all Rialto police officers with were down almost 90% from the prior year.It turns out when civilians knew they were being recorded, they — not the cops — behaved better and stop making false accusations. The use of force by cops also declined, but, again, not because the police changed their conduct. No, the cops continued performing as they'd been trained. Civilians, aware that they were being taped, were less confrontational and were more likely to cooperate and follow instructions. As a result, cops needed to use force less frequently.Still, when actor Jesse Williams gave a four-minute rant at the 2016 BETAwards about what he considered racist police practices, he claimed, ""What we've been doing is looking at the data, and we know that police somehow manage to de-escalate, disarm and not kill white people every day.""Other columns by Larry ElderMore Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

54,COP,"Just how bad will the U.S.' slap-fight over trade, which escalated with China on Friday, be for S&P 500 earnings and stocks? Just how much can the U.S. economy, which delivered solid June jobs growth on Friday, still grow after a nine-year expansion?Analysts expect another blowout quarter in Q2 — 20.7% earnings-per-share growth for S&P 500 index components and an 8.1% jump in revenue, according to Thomson Reuters. Wall Street is betting on continued scorching results for the rest of the year. But they may not be as scorching if President Donald Trump's trade wars with China, Canada, Mexico, Europe and others become more heated. The quiet earnings growth next year might be even more muted.Analysts say the effects of a trade war have yet to be priced into financial forecasts.""I think the first tangible impact should start showing up in estimate revisions as these earnings results come out,"" said Sheraz Mian, director of research at Zacks.In other words, the second-quarter earnings season could offer some higher drama than CEOs' usual blanched remarks about ""headwinds"" and ""tailwinds."" Investors, even more than usual, will focus on earnings guidance and post-earnings call commentary to get some answers as to how the tariffs will affect profit, sales, prices, corporate strategy and shareholder returns.Higher costs for parts and supplies that U.S. companies bring in from overseas could mean higher costs for customers. Businesses could rethink or even uproot complex global supply chains. Higher prices on U.S.-made goods sold overseas could crimp international demand. Companies could cut or delay major investments.S&P 500 index companies, filled with hundreds of U.S. multinationals and exporters, are more exposed to tariffs and global demand than the U.S. economy itself.As for the second-quarter itself, the gains from S&P 500 companies come courtesy of President Trump's tax cuts and an enduring U.S. economy.Rebounding oil prices will lift the energy sector's Q2 earnings by around 141.5%, with sales up some 20%, according to Thomson. S&P 500 energy stocks, which include Dow Jones giants Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) as well as ConocoPhillips (COP), Valero (VLO), Marathon Oil (MRO), Schlumberger (SLB) and many others, have generally been strong performers.Analysts expect the S&P 500 financials to clock a 22% gain in earnings on a 4.5% bump in revenue, as JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and other banks enjoy lower taxes and deregulation. Thomson forecasts semiconductors and internet software and services to lead the S&P 500 tech components toward 25.5% earnings growth. Tech revenue is seen jumping 12%. Apple (AAPL), Intel (INTC), Amazon.com (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Facebook (FB) are all slated to deliver solid-to-stellar growth.As estimates stand now, Thomson Reuters is forecasting the 20%-plus earnings growth to reach into the third and fourth quarters.""The last time we had earnings growth in Q3 and Q4 like this was in 2010,"" Tajinder Dhillon, senior research analyst at Thomson Reuters, said in an email.However, looking past 2018, analysts appear to have a harder time justifying bullish expectations for S&P 500 companies.""You look at the numbers going forward, you really don't start to see a significant drop in growth until you get into 2019, when again, you'll be back to apples-to-apples on the tax rates,"" said John Butters, senior earnings analyst at FactSet.But tougher comparisons aren't a massive concern right now, analysts say. And next year's growth still looks solid. Dhillon said that for 2019 investors can expect a 9.7% earnings growth rate, ""which is still higher than the 20-year average of 7.3%.""Wall Street also worries that the U.S. economy has fewer tools at its disposal to keep its marathon run going. The dollar is stronger. The yield curve is flatter due partly to the Federal Reserve's decisions to lift short-term interest rates.The narrowing yield curve, the gap between rates on short-term and long-term government debt, looms large for banks in particular. The flatter curve, also seen as a precursor to an economic downturn, has dragged bank stocks lower in recent months.Banks also lend money to borrowers based on long-term rates, but borrow from depositors according to short-term rates. The narrower the difference between the two, the narrower the banks' net interest margins. JPMorgan, Citigroup (C) and Wells Fargo (WFC) report second-quarter earnings on Friday.The three banking giants, which all announced hefty shareholder-return packages last month, are expected to deliver solid EPS growth. But JPMorgan stock, along with that of Citigroup, Wells Fargo and others, is near 2018 lows.When the Fed raises rates that affects the money flowing into global, emerging markets as well.""If U.S. interest rates are going up,"" Mian said, ""and an investor or a class of investors is scouring world markets for yield and returns, and if the yield and return is going up in a developed market like the U.S., then there's no reason to take the extra risk of going to Argentina or Turkey when you can get it in the U.S.""The U.S. on Friday lobbed tariffs at $34 billion worth of Chinese products — more than 800 types of products total. That's the first part of a $50 billion response for what Trump says are China's trade abuses against the U.S.The U.S. tariffs target aircraft parts, industrial parts and equipment, some vehicles and other machinery. The duties from the U.S. targeted products related to China's tech-focused ""Made in China 2025"" plan. Trump has said that initiative would ""hurt economic growth for the United States and many other countries.""""The United States can no longer tolerate losing our technology and intellectual property through unfair economic practices,"" Trump said in a statement last month.China on Friday responded with penalties of its own on U.S. products, including automakers and agriculture. China aimed those tariffs squarely at Trump's base.Trump has threatened to levy another $200 billion in tariffs on China, and even more. Meanwhile, Trump has threatened to impose a global import tariff on autos. That follows duties on steel and aluminum that have spurred Europe, Canada and Mexico to retaliate.Further trade discord could force companies to rethink their supply chains. Those adjustments could undo corporate America's efforts over the past two decades to more efficiently manage their inventories. Such practices over that time firmed up businesses' balance sheets.The brinkmanship has swept up some of the most iconic American businesses along the way. General Motors (GM) said as much last week, warning that more tariffs would lead to ""reduced presence at home and abroad for this iconic American company.""Harley-Davidson (HOG) said it would offer more detail, on its earnings call this month, about its plans to move some production out of the U.S. to skirt tariffs from the EU. Brown-Forman (BFB) is raising the price of Jack Daniel's in parts of Europe because of the tariffs imposed by the EU.No one knows how the Trump trade wars, and their impact on S&P 500 companies, will play out.""We expect company-specific risks from tariffs and China-trade exposures to be a central discussion topic during 2Q18 earnings calls,"" RBC analyst Deane Dray, who covers industrials vulnerable to steel and aluminum tariffs, wrote in a note last month. ""But no one has a crystal ball on how the tariff situation will ultimately play out, especially the potential knock-on effects.""He said companies like 3M (MMM) and Danaher (DHR) looked best equipped among industrials to handle the trade disputes.The trade war also threatens chipmakers like Micron (MU). A Chinese court blocked sales of some of its chips in the country, a move seen as pushback from the nation against Trump's trade salvos. China has held up approving the Qualcomm (QCOM) takeover of NXP Semiconductors (NXPI). Boeing (BA) isn't subject to China tariffs, but Beijing could favor Airbus (EADSY) jets in a protracted U.S.-China trade war. The aerospace company in April downplayed worries over a trade war.Baird analyst Benjamin Hartford covers transportation and logistics companies like UPS (UPS), FedEx (FDX) and Expeditors International (EXPD). Hartford wrote in a research note last month that he'd seen no ""material evidence (yet) of freight volume weakness amid rising global trade tensions.""Some analysts, like Tigress' Ivan Feinseth, expressed optimism that strength in corporate earnings would offset any trade damage. Others wonder how much a trade war will hurt corporate travel for the likes of global carriers like American Airlines (AAL) and Delta Air Lines (DAL), and cargo demand broadly. Delta Air earnings are due Thursday.""We still expect demand to grow, but those expectations are dampened with each new tariff introduced,"" Alexandre de Juniac, CEO of the International Air Transport Association, said of air cargo demand in a statement this week.

That self-confidence about how to become rich is even more pronounced among male millennials. An astounding 73% of them expect to become millionaires or already have reached that goal. Still, there's nothing wrong with aiming high. So the key question is, How can millennials achieve their aim of amassing $1 million?Experts do in fact offer roadmaps for how to become rich. One way that millennials — who range from 21 to 37 years of age, brokerage TD Ameritrade (AMTD) says — can build their wealth is by investing in assets that grow — not just park them in a piggy bank, where they do nothing. Another step millennials should take, one expert says, is to limit how much advice they take from the, you know, ""experts.""""You can learn a lot from your peers, not just from older 'experts',"" said Ian Rosen, CEO of StockTwits, an online community of nearly 2 million investors and traders, the bulk of whom are millennials. StockTwits members help educate each other by sharing more than 200,000 messages per day about markets and investing.Rosen says that many millennials are jaded about so-called experts, who were the high priests of the financial industry and nearly broke the global economy during the Great Recession, enriching themselves while financially hurting millennials' parents and grandparents.

Since credit card debt charges very high interest, shop around for a balance-transfer card that would charge you less. Also, pay down the balance on whichever credit card charges the highest interest. And if you pay off debt in minimum monthly installments, be sure to pay down principal as well as interest so that you eventually get rid of the balance.Yet 50% of millennials don't invest in the stock market.

Simpson murder trial, would have done with notes to and from LAPD lead detectives Tom Lange and Philip Vannatter in which they demeaned Simpson's fans. Imagine a written exchange in which one detective said, ""We'll stop him!"" Imagine Cochran's opening and closing arguments, to say nothing of his cross-examination, if he'd had evidence similar to the kind of bias found in the Department of Justice inspector general's report on the FBI's handling of the Hillary Clinton email investigation.The DOJ IG report included several messages between FBI attorneys and employees who worked on the email investigation. Here is one from an unidentified FBI employee (who didn't work on the email investigation) to FBI attorneys, the day after Trump's election: ""I can't stop crying. ... You promised me this wouldn't happen. YOU PROMISED. ... Trump's supporters are all poor to middle class, uneducated, lazy POS that think he will magically grant them jobs for doing nothing. They probably didn't watch the debates, aren't fully educated on his policies, and are stupidly wrapped up in his unmerited enthusiasm.""This is an Aug. 8, 2016, text message exchange between an FBI investigator — who was helping lead the investigation into Russia's interference in the election at the time — and an FBI senior attorney, who were both married to other people and having an affair with each other. In the message, released to the public for the first time, FBI attorney Lisa Page wrote: ""(Trump's) not ever going to become president, right? Right?!"" ""No. No he won't. We'll stop it,"" said lead agent Peter Strzok.Yet, incredibly, the IG concluded that political bias did not influence the outcome of the investigation. The report said: ""We did not find documentary or testimonial evidence that improper considerations, including political bias, directly affected the specific investigative actions we reviewed.""Still, when IG Michael Horowitz testified about his report, as ex-CBS News reporter Sharyl Attkisson notes, Horowitz used many double negatives: ""What we say here is not ... that there was no bias.""

Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, and Horowitz:Crapo: ""What you're telling us is you found bias; those who you found the bias among said, 'Well, we didn't let it bleed into our work performance,' and you don't have evidence to disprove that.""Horowitz: ""Correct.""The IG report said: ""When one senior FBI official, Strzok, who was helping to lead the Russia investigation at the time, conveys in a text message to another senior FBI official, Page, that 'we'll stop' candidate Trump from being elected — after other extensive text messages between the two disparaging candidate Trump — it is not only indicative of a biased state of mind but, even more seriously, implies a willingness to take official action to impact the presidential candidate's electoral prospects.

Simpson case, then-LAPD Chief Willie Williams, who happened to be black, ordered a report to determine whether any bias or misconduct affected the integrity of their investigation. Some investigators, the report found, made minor procedural errors. But the report found neither evidence of bias against Simpson nor evidence of misconduct by any of the investigators, let alone any bias or misconduct that affected the judgment of the investigators.Now suppose the LAPD report had noted numerous instances of bias and demeaning remarks by several investigators toward Simpson, yet the report nevertheless concluded, ""We did not find documentary or testimonial evidence that improper considerations, including political bias, directly affected the specific investigative actions we reviewed.""Seriously?YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:Who Are Those Mysterious Trump-Hating FBI Officials?

61,COP,"What is it about our entertainment elites that makes them think they are so much wiser than everyone else? Why do they seem to think that comedians like Samantha Bee and Donald Trump impersonators like Alec Baldwin are going to save America with their rants?The arrogance of the late-night ""comedians"" overflowed when Bee called Ivanka Trump a ""feckless c---."" See how Bee's old boss Jon Stewart came rushing to her defense: ""You could not find a kinder, smarter, more lovely individual than Samantha Bee. Trust me; if she called someone a ..."" (Translation: The person deserved it.)How hard would it be to find someone kinder and smarter than Bee? Most Americans could do it in 10 seconds. But that's how the vile entertainers stand up for one another. They are the true elites, engorged with self-absorption and disdainful of anyone who misses the point that they are the witty conscience of the country. Standards? They have none. They are above them. Thus, they viciously carve up conservatives in a way they would never dream of talking about their liberal heroes. (Rewind to Bee hugging Hillary Clinton and crying out, ""It should have been you!"")Bee's arrogance was self-evident in her lame ""apology"" that began with a sarcastic ""Sorry for breaking America."" She shot back at critics: ""Look, if you are worried about the death of civility, don't sweat it. I'm a comedian. People who hone their voices in basement bars while yelling back at drunk hecklers are definitely not paragons of civility. ... Civility is just nice words. Maybe we should all worry a little bit more about the niceness of our actions.""""Don't sweat it. I'm a comedian"" is a Get Out of Jail Free card. They can compare conservatives to Hitler, Stalin, Pol Pot, Osama bin Laden and Satan, but if you think that's too rough, ""I'm a comedian."" They can pretend to be policy wonks, and when their ""facts"" crumble, ""I'm a comedian."" They can make ""jokes"" about beheading the president, and that's not vicious ... when done by a comedian.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""Entertainers"" like Bee should not have a platform to spew hateful, sexist slurs. Just like Kathy Griffin, she only apologized for her own selfish interest. As Bill Donohue of the Catholic League put it: ""A comedian has no more right to obscenely insult people than a cop has a right to randomly beat a person up. Neither should be allowed to take cover hiding behind his status.""Liberals have argued that not only did Donald Trump and Ivanka Trump deserve to be ""called out"" for their inhumanity but also every vile insult of Donald Trump's family is somehow his doing. A columnist for the Washington Post even held Trump responsible for America's declining birthrate. (Liberals won't bring children into Trump's world.)What responsibility do they think they bear for our discourse? In 2006, Baldwin wrote in the Huffington Post that then-Vice President Dick Cheney is a ""terrorist"" and a ""lying, thieving Oil Whore. Or, a murderer of the US Constitution."" In 2010, Stewart welcomed now-infamous accused sexual harasser Louis C.K. to ""The Daily Show"" and let him proclaim, ""I was going to say that the Pope f---- boys, and I didn't have time."" In 2012, Bill Maher welcomed former Gov. Sarah Palin's vice presidential candidacy by calling her the C-word and a ""dumb twat.""Search for any condemnation from Tinseltown.People like Bee and Maher mistake their rage-filled rants for humor and mistake their emotional contempt for conservative politicians for expertise.

67,COP,"My youngest son's college graduation ceremony was scheduled to be held outdoors. The invitation specified that it would be moved inside to the gym only in the event of ""severe"" weather. As it turned out, the day was unseasonably cold (low 50s) with occasional drizzle — probably about as nasty as the weather gets in May without qualifying for severe status.Yet my husband and I huddled together in the stands of Franklin Field and wouldn't have missed it for the world. Ceremonies are important. We need markers for the milestones of our lives. They seal the moment that is both an ending and a beginning.So much changes so fast in our world that it is comforting to settle into honored rituals. As the strains of Edward Elgar's ""Pomp and Circumstance"" pipe through the stadium, you feel a stirring of memory and a sense of peace. It has always been like this. It always will be. Some things are timeless. Or so we hope.Along with the usual assortment of political science, English and math majors, the University of Pennsylvania confers degrees in fields that scarcely existed when I was an undergrad. Students strode across the stage to accept diplomas for studies such as biophysics, bioengineering and something called the Vagelos Integrated Program in Energy Research (VIPER). We all smiled when the dean of the engineering school presented his candidates by quoting a scientist: ""The future is hard to predict. But the best way to predict it is to invent it."" Nice. And, if you'll indulge a little chauvinism, innovation remains a great American strength.Most commencement addresses are dull recitations of clichés, though some stand out. Penn's award-winning psychology professor Angela Duckworth, who has made a splash with her research into the importance of grit in school and in life, delivered a modest and uplifting address about how her career meandered before she finally settled into her specialty. Her advice: It's OK to not have things figured out.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseBut one cliché that dominates many commencement addresses really should be retired, and that's the one that exhorts the graduates to go out and change the world.High school and college graduates don't know very much about the world. Maybe before they set out to change things, they should get a good grasp of how things actually work. Ask them the difference between term and whole life insurance, or how to change a tire, or how much to save every month, or whether you should call a cop after a fender bender. Ask them if they've ever organized a dance, far less a factory.There are always things that need changing, of course. Nor should we wish to curdle the natural idealism of the young. But along with calls for change, shouldn't the young be reminded of the preciousness of their inheritance? So many of the things they take for granted were achieved by their forebears at great cost — and I'm not referring to what the parents spent for those fancy degrees. So many things about our society work well. Our supermarkets are stocked with food from around the globe. Our homes, offices and cars are heated and cooled for our comfort. Emergency help is available nearly everywhere by dialing 911. Just as crucial as trying to fix what's broken is taking the time to appreciate and shore up what is sound.The great liberal virtue is impatience with injustice. The great conservative virtue is gratitude.Before graduates are urged to change the world, perhaps they should be encouraged to change themselves or, at least, to look inward. How many people have vainly resolved to lose 10 pounds or to donate 10% of their income to the less fortunate?Change is hard, even when — or perhaps especially when — you're trying to change yourself. If you've been unable to reform yourself, take that humility to the world, and remember it when you notice others' flaws. Each graduate can ask himself: How kind was I to my siblings this year, and how dutiful to my parents? Taking his place in the adult world, he should resolve first of all to do the things within his own power: to be a faithful spouse and a reliable parent.Humility, duty, self-examination, gratitude. Perhaps those are not the most inspiring words. But heeded, they stand the best chance of truly changing the world.More Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market? Start with IBD University.

72,COP,"HOUSTON —  Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) CEO Timothy Dove said the success of the Permian Basin is a unique phenomenon that can't be replicated anywhere else.X Pioneer has been involved in the Barnett and Eagle Ford plays in Texas, but the Permian, with its 90,000 square miles and deep shale reservoirs, is ""demonstratively"" different from any other play in the U.S.While the industry debates whether U.S. shale's success can be exported to other potential shale plays around the world, like Argentina's Vaca Muerta formation, Dove thinks the success of the Permian and shale in general are distinctly American.""There are a lot of areas around the world that would love to have the opportunity to develop a shale basin but they don't have the infrastructure, land ownership opportunities, and service companies allowing them to do so,"" Dove said Tuesday at CERAWeek 2018, a top gathering of energy industry and policy leaders. ""We have the golden goose right before us.""Dove continued, saying the Permian is in the ""imagination of everyone in the oil business, including OPEC.""During a dinner meeting with OPEC and shale executives that he attended Monday night, Dove said OPEC believes shale has an important role to play in meeting new demand growth.But he also warned that President Trump's proposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports would have a ""negative impact"" on Pioneer's returns.Pioneer shares closed down 1% at 169.96 on the stock market today.Use IBD's MarketSmith For Free Until March 11

75,COP,"When investing in crude oil stocks, investors have to be aware of three trends.The most obvious trend pertains to the price of oil. The second trend pertains to how oil stocks are behaving vs. the S&P 500. The third trend is determining which of the 10 industry groups in the oil space are doing best.So, what is the current situation on those three scores?Item 1: The price of oil hit a short-term closing low Feb. 13. Since then, light sweet crude is up 16%.Item 2: For the past couple of weeks, the oil stock sector held gains of 4% to 5% year to date, easily topping the S&P 500's roughly 2% decline.Item 3: Since the Feb. 13 low, the best performers in the oil space are international explorers, up 14%; field services, up 14%; drillers, up 14%; and U.S. explorers, up 13%. (The worst performer is the pipeline group, down 9%.)Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe third item is especially important. An investor can be right about the oil sector but if wrong about the oil groups, losses are likely.Three oil stocks appeared recently in the Big Cap 20, and they are from the strong groups. EOG Resources (EOG) and Continental Resources (CLR) are U.S. explorers. ConocoPhillips (COP) is an international explorer.EOG is a turnaround story. The company lost $1.61 per share in 2016 but delivered a profit of $1.12 per share in 2017. The Street estimates earnings will grow 309% to $4.58 per share this year.Houston-based EOG's relative strength line is rising and near a 52-week high. The RS line measures a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500. A rising line points to outperformance.EOG's stock chart is interesting. The stock spent most of 2017 constructing a cup-with-handle base. The base was 44 weeks long.The breakout came in late October, when the stock crossed above a 98.47 buy point. The stock rose almost 10%.Then a second consolidation formed. The decline wiped out all gains from the entry, which triggered a round-trip sell signal. A breakout Dec. 26 led to another 10% gain.EOG is now approaching a 119.10 buy point in somewhat odd cup pattern. The left side of the pattern was built in two weeks — weekly losses of 4% and 11%.What was the two-week drop about? Apparently oil prices, which fell 11% in the same period. The general market was going through a contraction as well. The latest base is more choppy than earlier patterns, so it's as well constructed.Continental Resources (CLR) cleared a 58.99 buy point in April and is now too extended to buy.ConocoPhillips (COP) also broke out in April. The stock is extended from a 61.41 buy point.RELATED:The Secret To Investing? It's Just Hard WorkCrude Stocks That Beat ViewsSix Stocks That Broke Out Recently

Lance said the company is doing the same in the Permian Basin.""In two years, we'll figure out a better way to drill the Permian than we are drilling now,"" he said.Lance also sees future oilfield improvements coming mostly from the completion side, as opposed to the drilling side, as companies figure out how to improve finishing techniques with longer lateral wells.Use IBD's MarketSmith For Free Until March 11

103,COP,"Exxon Mobil (XOM) fell far short of Q4 estimates Friday, while Chevron (CVX) beat revenue views as oil prices rallied but missed on earnings.X Estimates: EPS to rise 19% to $1.07 as revenue climbs 22% to $74.44 billion, according to Zacks Investment Research.Results: EPS of 88 cents, excluding effects of tax cuts and other items, on revenue of $66.5 billion. Total production fell 3% to 3.99 million barrels of oil equivalent per day. Capital and exploration spending jumped 86% to $9 billion.Adjusted losses from U.S. upstream operations narrowed to $60 million from $193 million a year ago, and non-U.S. upstream earnings jumped 53% to $2.58 billion. U.S. downstream operations grew earnings 13% to $306 million, while non-U.S. operations saw a 33% drop to $646 million. U.S. chemical earnings climbed 25.6% to $442 million, while non-U.S. chemical earnings fell 5% to $493 million.Stock: Shares fell 5.3% to 84.36 on the stock market today. Technically, that's just above a recent 84.34 buy point after falling as low as 83 intraday. But the stock closed below its 50-day line in the heaviest volume in seven months.On Monday, Exxon announced that it would invest $50 billion over the next five years for U.S. operations tripling production in the Permian Basin, increasing production by 600,000 barrels of oil per day by 2025.Estimates: EPS to soar nearly 500% to $1.29 as revenue grows 19% to $37.55 billion.Results: EPS of 73 cents after adjusting for $2 billion in tax gains.

U.S. downstream operations earned $1.2 billion after breaking even a year ago, while international downstream earnings sank 76% to $84 million.Outlook: Full-year production to grow 4%-7%, driven by Australian LNG and the acceleration of Permian development.""Earnings and cash flow grew significantly in 2017,"" said CEO Michael Wirth in the earnings release. ""We achieved our objective of being cash flow positive through deliberate actions to reduce capital expenditures, lower our cost structure, start and ramp-up projects, and conclude planned asset sales. Higher commodity prices helped as well.""Stock: Shares fell 5.8% to 1218.29. The stock plunged below its 50-day moving average and a recent buy point in more than double normal volume, now erasing a 10.7% gain from the entry.Chevron has already boosted its quarterly dividend, announcing Wednesday that it will go up 4% to $1.12 to mark the 31st year in a row of an increase.

104,COP,"On a recent Sunday evening, Katie Hill, 30, whose father is an LA police lieutenant in Beverly Hills, boarded a red-eye flight to Washington for frenetic fundraising and networking. She must really want to get into the House of Representatives.If she does, she will have defeated a two-term incumbent, Rep. Steve Knight, 51, who was an LA police officer for 18 years and is the last Republican in a district containing a significant portion of Los Angeles County.California's 25th District includes Simi Valley, which is famous as the home of the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library and the trial of police officers charged with brutality against Rodney King. It is home to many of the Los Angeles police officers who helped quell the city rioting after the accused officers' acquittal. Hill's father-in-law, too, is a cop. Her husband's uncle was an officer killed in the line of duty; his death is currently Orange County's only unsolved police murder. In the June 5 primary, Hill will be the first Democrat to receive her father's vote.The 25th is at the top of the list of seven (of 14) Republican-held California seats that Democrats hope to capture because Hillary Clinton carried them. The seven are almost a third of the 23 such districts nationwide.Joe Trippi, the Democratic consultant who was media adviser to Doug Jones' successful Alabama U.S. Senate campaign, says Jones got votes from Republicans who still support the president but want no more chaos. But referring to California Democrats, he warns that ""our own enthusiasm might get in the way.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThis is because in 2012, Democrats — who run this almost monochrome blue state — ignored the axiom that improvements often make things worse. They instituted a primary system under which the top two vote-getters for an office are on the November ballots, even if both are from the same party. This year, Democrats, fueled by fury against the president, might produce such a profusion of candidates that the Democratic vote will be fragmented, putting weak general-election Democrats, or no Democrats, on some November ballots.In 2014, when Republican Buck McKeon, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, retired after 11 terms representing the 25th, Republican Tony Strickland, with 30% of the primary vote, ran against Knight (28%) in November. Democrats were excluded because their top performer in the primary received 22%. In 2016, a Democrat, Bryan Caforio, ran against Knight and lost by 6 points while Clinton was winning the district by 7 points. Caforio is running again. Either he or Hill probably will be Knight's opponent in November.Congressional districts drawn by Republican state legislatures after the 2010 census and after that year's anti-Democratic wave election might somewhat insulate Republicans from a ""blue wave"" this year. But eight years is a long time in a dynamic region like Southern California, and for eight years the 25th has been receiving an influx of ""housing refugees"" — people of modest means seeking affordable housing outside the city, and bringing the city's political sensibility. The district is now 39% Latino.Donald Trump, who did not visit California in the 13 months after becoming president, did worse there in 2016 (31.6% of the vote) than Herbert Hoover did against Franklin Roosevelt in 1932 (37.4). Yes, Hoover was a California resident, but the national unemployment rate was 24.7%.The district is more than one-third Democratic, about one-third Republican, and one-quarter independent. Knight's vote for the Republican tax bill, with its limits on the deductibility of state and local taxes, adds to his vulnerability in high-tax California.Being 21 years younger than Knight is another Hill advantage. In 2008, Barack Obama carried national voters under age 45 by 15 points. In Alabama in December, Jones carried that age cohort by around 20 points.Suburban women, of whom the 25th District has many, also are recoiling against Republicans. The Economist reports that, nationally, ""around 400 women, mostly Democrats, are planning to run for the House, at least 50 for the Senate and 79 for governor. ... At state and local levels, the picture is the same. In 2015 and 2016, around 900 women consulted Emily's List (which supports women candidates) about standing for office; since Mr. Trump's election, over 26,000 have.""

105,COP,"Obama Scandal: Former President Obama and his political supporters have repeatedly stated that his administration was scandal-free, unlike administrations before and after. ""We're probably the first administration in modern history that hasn't had a major scandal in the White House,"" Obama himself said. A new book puts the lie to that statement.Never mind that the left-leaning big media basically ignored major scandals during the Obama years, ranging from the IRS targeting scandal and the VA's deadly waiting lists for veterans to Hillary Clinton's illegal use of an unsecured, hackable home-brew server for her official duties as secretary of state and the Fast and Furious gunwalking program.These and others were epic scandals that the media simply ignored or downplayed.The media have contrasted Obama's supposed honesty and forthrightness with President Trump's supposed venality and political unscrupulousness, as embodied in the year-and-a-half long Russia-Trump scandal investigation that shows few signs of letting up.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseBut now comes Peter Schweizer's new book, ""Secret Empires: How Our Politicians Hide Corruption and Enrich Their Families and Friends,"" which shows that the Obama administration and its cronies were up to their necks in questionable business deals and may even have intentionally distorted public policy to accommodate their own profit-making.The book claims ""Obama and his administration would deem industries either destructive to the environment or exploitative for the financial and professional gain of his friends, including industries such as coal mining, offshore drilling, cash advance companies, and for-profit colleges,""  wrote Katelyn Caralle of the Washington Examiner.Schweizer's book, based on extensive research, says that Obama acted to regulate certain industries in such a way that the regulations lowered the value of some of the companies, wrote Katelyn Caralle of the Washington Examiner. These actions let two family friends to profit handsomely on deals through their own investment firm.Here's how it worked: Obama buddies Marty Nesbitt and Harreld Kirkpatrick III formed a private equity investment firm called Vistria, right around the time Obama was re-elected in 2012.Nothing wrong with that, except, as Schweizer notes in his book, ""A curious pattern began to emerge. Obama and his administration would attack industries with government power, which led to substantially lower valuations for these companies. Nesbitt and Vistria, or others close to Obama, could then acquire those assets for pennies on the dollar.""As an example, Schweizer cites the case of for-profit higher education schools like University of Phoenix, ITT Technical Institute, and DeVry University. In 2013, Obama blamed the schools for taking advantage of students by saddling them with massive amounts of student debt, ruining their credit and making a profit on it. He ordered the Federal Trade Commission to go after them.In the case of the University of Phoenix, its parent Apollo Education Group was suspended after a Federal Trade Commission investigation in 2015. The following year, three companies, including Vistria, swooped in to buy what remained of Apollo at a price 90% below its share price before the investigation.As Vistria's education investment portfolio bulged, a number of Obama Education Department officials, including Secretary of Education Arne Duncan, ended up taking high-level jobs with Vistria.That's just one example. There are others.Schweizer noted in his book, for instance, that both Vice President Joe Biden and Secretary of State John Kerry were deeply involved in trade and security talks with China even as that country began its aggressive campaign to expand its military and physical presence in the South China Sea. Contrary to standard diplomatic practice, however, both played ""good cop,"" not seriously confronting China on its misbehavior.Remember, Biden and Kerry were close friends from their years spent together in the Senate. So there was little surprise when Biden's son, Hunter, and Kerry's stepson, Christopher Heinz, one of the heirs to the Heinz ketchup fortune, went into business together in 2009.They created a number of equity and real estate investment firms allied to Rosemont Capital, ""the alternative investment fund of the Heinz Family Office.""So far so good. Except, ""Over the next seven years, as both Joe Biden and John Kerry negotiated sensitive and high-stakes deals with foreign governments, Rosemont entities secured a series of exclusive deals with those same foreign governments.""In December of 2013, for instance, Biden traveled to China for talks. He brought Hunter Biden along. While there, the senior Biden soft-pedaled China's clear aggression, and played up the bilateral trade partnership. Ten days after the trip concluded, China's central bank, the Bank of China, set up a $1 billion investment joint venture called Bohai Harvest RST. For the record, the ""RS"" referred to Biden's son's firm, Rosemont Seneca.That's questionable enough.But months later, in July 2014, Secretary of State John Kerry traveled to China, also for talks. Kerry talked little of China's clear aggression, but did conspicuously note that ""China and the United States represent the greatest economic alliance trading partnership in the history of humankind.""He should know. In the ensuing months, Chinese government-linked firms took major stakes in several of the firms owned or controlled by Hunter Biden and Chris Heinz, and provided them with massive funding totaling billions of dollars. Nor is this the only scandal involving John Kerry.And this just scratches the surface. The book is a catalog, a virtual roadmap, to the way corrupt business gets done in Washington — and why Americans are smart to question why their representative go to Washington as paupers, and return as millionaires.We can only hope that as Biden or Kerry gears up for a challenge to Trump in the 2020 presidential contest, they will receive the same relentless scrutiny that a Republican with the same record of venality would get.

110,COP,"HOUSTON — Tech giants Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL), Facebook (FB), and Microsoft (MSFT) have raced to apply artificial intelligence to their businesses, and the oil industry is starting to seize on AI's benefits too.X Babur Ozden, co-founder and CEO of AI startup Maana, said he has heard from 20 large oil companies inquiring about artificial intelligence in the last 12 months, up from just six or seven in the prior 12 months.The reason interest is surging now is because artificial intelligence is ""actually doable,"" he said in an interview with IBD at CERAWeek, explaining that advancements in cloud computing and infrastructure have made AI more affordable and accessible.""The industrial world is waking up to best practices,"" he said. ""They are all waking up to it.""Several heavyweights in the energy industry are already investors in his company, including General Electric (GE), Chevron (CVX), Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) and Saudi Aramco.Shares of Chevron closed down 0.4% on the stock market today.

Instead, it will probably take about a decade for AI's use to be fully optimized, Ozden predicted.But he agrees with ConocoPhillips (COP) Chief Technology Officer Gregory Leveille that there will be autonomous drilling en masse before autonomous cars are on the roads en masse.""I believe so because of the complexity of having a car in a metropolitan environment with a number of moving things around it,"" Ozden said.

113,COP,"Retail investors turned more leery in a volatile February — yet they used the stock market pullback as an opportunity to buy Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN) and General Electric (GE) rather than flee.X Customers at online brokerage TD Ameritrade (AMTD) were net buyers of those stocks in a month that saw each of the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite fall more than 10% below recent highs. Worries about rising bond yields and inflation sparked a sharp sell-off in stocks, leading to a brief market correction. Stocks bottomed on Feb. 9, when the S&P 500 index rebounded from its 200-day moving average. The major averages did fall in February, breaking long monthly winning streaks.Meanwhile, volatility of the S&P 500, as measured by the Cboe Volatility Index, or VIX, spiked during the period. As the VIX rose above 50 for the first time since August 2015, it decreased the relative volatility of many widely held stocks, including GE, Apple and Facebook (FB), according to a new TD Ameritrade report. That led investors to ""significantly limit their volatility risk in the market, changing their game plan from less speculative to more of a low beta weighted one,"" said JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade, noting the rocky start to 2018 came after a tame 2017.Use IBD's MarketSmith For Free Until March 11

GE tumbled last week to its worst level since July 2010. GE and Apple are members of the Dow Jones industrial average. So are Boeing and Microsoft.Investors lessened their exposure to the equity markets in February, TD Ameritrade said.The Investor Movement Index, a proprietary measure of client behavior at the brokerage, fell 23% to 5.95 — a level not seen since January 2017 — in the four weeks ended Feb. 23. It was the second monthly decline in a row, after the index made record highs above 8.0 in the fall of 2017.An increase in the score tends to mean that investors are getting more bullish.

"
116,COP,"See stocks near a buy point, get chart pattern recognition and run custom screens. Start NowOf course, few Cabinet or White House appointees ever serve throughout an entire administration. Burnout is natural. Lucrative private-sector job offers multiply monthly. Normal people do not enjoy living inside the Beltway.Barack Obama had four defense secretaries, three national security advisers and five chiefs of staff. That is about par for a presidential tenure covering eight years.But the problem with all these rumors of departing generals is not just that they are likely false and shopworn. They also make no sense because the three generals have been radically successful. In just a year, they have markedly enhanced U.S. national security as well as the image of the Trump administration itself.The media, which is mostly anti-Trump, has always been schizophrenic in the coverage of the three generals. Some media outlets initially echoed old worries about too many Pentagon tentacles or the militarization of the executive branch. They forgot that generals, both active and retired, have long held administration jobs. Gen. Colin Powell, for instance, served four different presidents, starting with his tenure as national security adviser under Ronald Reagan.Others in the media had hoped that the mostly apolitical generals would nudge the wild-card Trump left of center and embed him within the Washington foreign-policy establishment.But now, most journalists seem baffled that the generals are either proving too conservative or not standing up to Trump enough — as if playing the role of the loud maverick to a president had been in the job description of any Cabinet secretary or White House official of the past.By late 2016, strategic deterrence had mostly been lost due to the prior administration's failed Russian reset; unchecked Chinese ascendance; a comatose approach to North Korean nuclear enhancements; the Iran deal; empty red lines, step-over lines and deadlines; the Syrian and Libyan misadventures; the collapse of Iraq and rise of ISIS; and the alienation of Israel and the Gulf states.In reaction to these growing threats, our friends have been reassured, enemies have been warned, and stability is returning. ISIS is on the run. North Korea is forcefully embargoed. Defense spending is up. Missile defense is recalibrated. And reset fantasies are over with Vladimir Putin.Trump's improving poll numbers reflect the order that Kelly established out of chaos in the West Wing. In delusional fashion, the media had hoped that a four-star Marine general might be a liberal wolf in conservative sheep's clothing — so it's easy to understand why the number of Kelly's media critics has grown.Kelly is a no-nonsense traditionalist and serves Trump not just by improving the mechanics of day-to-day operations in the White House, but also by helping Trump with the shared goal of restoring U.S. economic and military dynamism.Mattis and McMaster are said to play good cops abroad to Trump's bad cop. By warning that the alternative to negotiations is a raging Trump who might do anything, the two generals are purportedly leveraging everything from delinquent NATO members' defense contributions to European help in isolating Iran and North Korea.The problem with that scenario is not that it is absolutely false, but that the stereotype is exaggerated and simplistic. After all, it is difficult to see where Mattis and McMaster have disagreed with Trump — or, for that matter, with the American — on existential issues.Who wishes to return to Obama's principles of ""strategic patience"" and ""lead from behind""? Do critics want more of the massive Defense Department cuts that had been the most severe since the end of the Korean War? Should there be more apology tours, or further outreach to Cuba and Venezuela?The real challenge for the generals has been how to warn enemies and reassure friends that past global provocations against U.S. interests will now be deterred — but without a major war.So far, Kelly, Mattis and McMaster — along with Ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson — have avoided both nation-building interventionism and lead-from-behind abdication of postwar responsibilities.When they go abroad, their wide portfolios and latitude are signaling that they are in charge not despite but rather because of Trump.To reverse the purported quip of Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Perigord: To fire any one of these three generals at this point would be worse than a mistake, it would be a crime.You might also like...Victor Davis Hanson: Has Trump Nominated Too Many Military Leaders — Or Not Enough?Trump Defeats ISIS In Months — After Years Of Excuses From ObamaTrump Changed His Mind About Afghanistan Policy — And It's Good He Did

121,COP,"LOS ANGELES — It was dicey being Jewish in a Russia that was tolerant of pogroms, and then came the threat of conscription into the 1904-05 Russo-Japanese War, so one of Mayor Eric Garcetti's great-grandfathers headed West to America. Another Garcetti great-grandfather married a Mexican woman who, fleeing revolutionary ferment there, headed north to America. Which is why Garcetti, a fourth-generation resident of the world's most polyglot city, is as American as a kosher burrito, a delicacy available at Mexikosher on Pico Boulevard.XTrim, natty — colorful socks are, alas, fashionable — and with the polish of one born to public attention (his father Gil was LA's district attorney who prosecuted O.J. Simpson), Garcetti, like dozens of Democrats who have noticed recent presidential history, is asking: Why not me?Good question. Although presidents Andrew Johnson, Grover Cleveland and Calvin Coolidge had been mayors of Greeneville, Tennessee, Buffalo and Northampton, Massachusetts, respectively, no mayor has gone directly from a city hall to the White House. But the 44th president came from eight years in the nation's most docile and least admirable state legislature (Barack Obama effectively began running for president as soon as he escaped to Washington from Springfield, Illinois). The 45th came from six bankruptcies and an excruciating television show. So, it is not eccentric to think that a two-term mayor of one of the world's most complicated cities might be as qualified to be president as was, say, the governor of one of the 23 states (Arkansas) with a population smaller than this city's. And less challenging: LA's schools teach children whose parents speak Tagalog and 91 other languages.Recent history does not suggest that America has such a surplus of presidential talent that it can afford to spurn an audition by a mayor who governs where over 40% of waterborne imports enter the country — through the LA and Long Beach ports. Where more than 50% of residents are immigrants or the children of immigrants. Where immigrants from more than 30 nations form those nations' largest overseas communities.No Hidden Agenda: Get News From A Pro-Free Market, Pro-Growth PerspectiveHis immersion in immigration realities gives him standing to warn his party, which is addicted to identity politics, that ""people do want a national identity."" We are ""not an ethnic nation but a civic nation,"" and Democrats must speak to ""identity"" rather than ""identities."" Also, he brings practicality to the ideological argument about ""sanctuary cities"": When a Korean immigrant who became a citizen and then an LA cop was shot, not fatally, witnesses and others in the neighborhood, many of them likely illegal immigrants, came forward with information that enabled the police to capture her assailant within hours. Such police-community cooperation is, Garcetti says, jeopardized when local police are viewed as closely allied with federal immigration enforcement.Garcetti, 47, is a generation younger than some progressives' pin-ups (Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Joe Biden). And living far from Washington, he is positioned to deplore the Beltway, within which his party has been concentrating power for a century. He suggests a rule for those who are perpetually enraged about the president: ""You only get five minutes a day to yell at your TV."" Democrats, he says, sometimes are ""the smarty-pants party"" that does not ""speak plain English."" He seems, however, to be tiptoeing on egg shells when trying to avoid offending his party's easily offended keepers of litmus tests. When, last September, an interviewer asked him if gun manufacturers should be liable for the misuse of their products, he said, ""I think you have to be open to that."" Such mush (should we be ""open to"" distillers' liability for drunken driving?) does not move nominating electorates.New York's mayor (1933-1945) Fiorello La Guardia, a Republican in a Democratic city, famously said, ""There is no Republican or Democratic way to pick up the garbage."" And mayors have what Garcetti considers ""the luxury of doing."" But LA mayors are not powerful — the schools are run by others — and he must get along with the mayors of 87 other cities in LA county. This is, however, training for the presidency, which is less powerful than those who seek it think it is until, in office, they must deal with Washington's rival power centers.California's presidential primary, which usually has been a June irrelevancy, will occur in March 2020. This might benefit Kamala Harris, the state's freshman U.S. senator, too. Anyway, Garcetti deserves a hearing. America could do worse, it usually does and in 33 months it probably will.You might also like ...Taxifornia Does It AgainMinimum-Wage Is A Job-KillerOther columns by George F. Will

128,COP,"Netflix (NFLX) shares raced into record high territory in early trading Tuesday after the internet television network posted a huge beat in subscriber additions in the fourth quarter, despite enacting a price increase.X Netflix late Monday said it added 8.33 million new subscribers worldwide in the fourth quarter, soundly beating its target of 6.3 million. It ended the December quarter with 117.58 million streaming subscribers worldwide, including 54.75 million in the U.S. and 62.83 million in foreign markets.Netflix stock soared 10% higher to hit a new closing high at 250.29 on the stock market today. It hit a regular-session record high of 257.71 intraday.The stock earned a slew of price-target increases from Wall Street analysts. The most bullish of the bunch is Bernstein analyst Todd Juenger, who upped his target to 302 from 230 and kept his outperform rating.Here are five key takeaways from Netflix's fourth-quarter earnings report:Netflix was conservative with its fourth-quarter guidance because of the price increases announced to its service plans in early October, Netflix Chief Financial Officer David Wells said on an investor webcast Monday.In the U.S., it raised the price of its midrange plan, which allows high-definition video streaming on two devices at a time, to $10.99 a month from $9.99. It upped the price of its top-tier plan, which allows ultra-high-definition video streaming on up to four screens at the same time, to $13.99 a month from $11.99. Netflix kept its basic plan, which allows standard-definition video streaming on one device at a time, at $7.99 a month. It also hiked its prices in Europe.Despite the price increases, Netflix had a ""great"" quarter for subscriber additions, thanks to the strength of its content offering, Wells said.The company credited hit original content such as TV series ""Stranger Things"" and ""The Crown"" and movies like ""Bright"" for its subscriber gains in the period.""We saw very little effect on sign-ups and growth"" from the price increases, Netflix Chief Executive Reed Hastings said on the webcast. ""Our content is making us a primary focus for consumers' entertainment. And so our responsibility is then to take that increased revenue and turn that into even better content. That's the fundamental deal. And consumers are tolerant as long as something's improving.""Netflix added nearly 2 million U.S. streaming subscribers in the fourth quarter, beating its target for 1.25 million.Hastings noted that the company predicted five years ago it could grow to 60 million to 90 million subscribers in the U.S. alone. At 55 million U.S. streaming subscribers today, it hasn't even hit the low end of that projection, he said.Netflix expects to get late adopters to its service through deals with cable and other pay-TV services. Those arrangements are designed to make it easy for consumers to sign up for Netflix through their current pay-TV provider, Netflix Chief Product Officer Greg Peters said on the webcast.Netflix management believes the internet television market will be able to support many successful streaming services.It cited Amazon.com (AMZN) and Apple (AAPL) as two rivals to watch in the year ahead, with Walt Disney (DIS) joining the fray in 2019.""Amazon Studios is likely to bring in a strong new leader given their large content budgets, and Apple is growing its programming, which we presume will either be bundled with
"
129,COP,"Apple Music or with iOS,"" Netflix executives said in a letter to shareholders.Hastings said he's looking forward to Disney's direct-to-consumer streaming video offering and expects to be a subscriber himself.""We think (it) will be very successful because Disney has super strong brands,"" Hastings said. ""We don't see it as a threat to us any more than Hulu has been.""Netflix's big-budget fantasy action movie ""Bright"" was savaged by critics, but Netflix subscribers loved it.""The consumer response, the viewer response, to the film has been great,"" Netflix Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos said on the webcast. ""It's one of our most watched pieces of original content, meaning TV show or film, that we've ever had on Netflix.""A better indicator than critics' reviews are user reviews on Rotten Tomatoes and user ratings on IMDb, Sarandos said.""The critics are pretty disconnected from the mass appeal,"" Hastings said.""Bright"" received just 26% positive reviews from critics, according to aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, but the audience score for the movie is 86% positive.""Bright"" reportedly cost $90 million to make and stars Will Smith and Joel Edgerton as cop partners in an alternate present-day where humans, orcs, elves and fairies coexist.Netflix said it expects to spend $7.5 billion to $8 billion on content in 2018, but that spending has grown along with Netflix's subscriber base, Wells said.However, Netflix is seeing the factors influencing its working capital needs on content starting to moderate, he said.Wall Street has been waiting for Netflix to take its foot off the accelerator when it comes to content spending and focus more on profitability and monetizing its huge user base.Netflix earned 41 cents a share, up 173% year over year, on sales of $3.29 billion, up 33%, for the December quarter.For the March quarter, Netflix expects to earn 63 cents a share, up 58%, on sales of $3.69 billion, up 40%.RELATED:Netflix Stock Jumps On Big Increase In New Subscribers

Total (TOT) gained 1% to 55.14, retaking a 55.14 entry.IBD'S TAKE: As an investor, you may wonder why buy points are important. The chart action of these top stocks offers an answer.On Tuesday, Ineos, the operator of the Forties pipeline in Scotland, said a leak that has kept it shutdown would be fixed in two to four weeks since the leak was discovered on Dec. 11.The reduction in supplies from the pipeline has helped propped up Brent crude prices for the last few weeks.RELATED: Energy Stocks And Industry News: Oil, Gas, Solar, Coal

That topped its previous all-time high of 204.38, reached on Oct. 17.

Earlier in the session, it notched a record high of 206.21.On Tuesday, Loop Capital Markets analyst David Miller reiterated his buy rating on Netflix and labeled it his ""best idea of 2018.""

They also said Netflix is likely to show its earnings power in 2018.IBD'S TAKE: Netflix stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 94, meaning it has outperformed 94% of stocks in key metrics over the past 12 months.

134,COP,"After strong 2017 gains, the S&P 500 index and other major averages rose sharply to new highs to start 2018. Chip stocks were strong even with Intel (INTC) disclosing a big flaw in many processors. Facebook (FB) and Netflix (NFLX) were among many breakouts, but often with some issues. Tesla (TSLA) struggled to get Model 3 out the factory gate while other auto stocks rallied despite U.S. auto sales capping their first annual decline since the financial crisis. Bitcoin had a relatively calm week of solid gains as rival cryptocurrencies surged ahead. Economic data were solid but shouldn't spook the Federal Reserve.X The Nasdaq composite, S&P 500 index and Dow industrials rose sharply to start 2018, with oil, steel and chip groups among the big winners, while utilities sold off. Facebook, Netflix (NFLX), Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT) and Exxon Mobil (XOM) were among those breaking out, but many were in low volume or had other notable flaws. Crude futures rose to a three-year high. The Treasury yield spread continued to narrow.Intel (INTC) fell as low as 42.69 after a security issue was revealed on its PC and server processors but rallied to close down 3.1% at 44.74.  The security issue could allow hackers to gather sensitive data from the memory of computing devices, but not modify, delete or corrupt data through the exploit, Intel said. The chipmaker said it has developed and is rapidly issuing software patches and firmware updates to correct the problem. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) saw its shares rally because its processors reportedly are not vulnerable to the same security exploit.Bitcoin prices rose to above $16,000 on Friday, capping a solid weekly gain in what was a relatively calm period for the fast-moving cryptocurrency. Alternative digital currencies Ripple and Ethereum surged to new highs. Founders Fund, co-founded by early Facebook investor Peter Thiel, invested $15 million-$20 million in Bitcoin — an investment worth hundreds of millions now, according to the Wall Street Journal reported. The Journal also reported that Merrill Lynch barred its financial advisors from making trades for clients in Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) or proposing any Bitcoin related investments. Russia is looking at creating its own cryptocurrency after President Vladimir Putin meet with Vitalik Buterin, the Russia-born founder of Ethereum, to figure out how to regulate them. China is reportedly looking to regulate power usage for Bitcoin mining after closing exchanges last year to reduce spreading financial risks.Nearly all automakers saw U.S. vehicle sales fall in December despite heavy incentives and a year-end sales push, but Ford Motor (F) and General Motors (GM) topped estimates, with Ford eking out a 0.9% gain. For 2017, U.S. auto sales fell 1.8% to 17.2 million vehicles, according to Autodata, marking the first decline in eight years. Both analysts and carmakers see a drop below 17 million in 2018. Despite weak auto sales, auto stocks continue to perform well, as investors expect the momentum in higher-margin SUV and truck sales to continue. GM rose 7.4% for the week, Ford 5.7% and Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) 22%.Tesla continues to struggle with production on its Model 3 sedans, with overall vehicle output stagnant in recent quarters. Tesla made 2,425 Model 3 sedans in the quarter, vs. consensus of 4,100. Tesla claimed it made ""major progress"" on bottlenecks but now expects to reach production of 5,000 Model 3s per week by the end of the second quarter, instead of the first quarter as previously planned. Tesla shares rose 1.7% but are still near seven-month lows.Shares of BlackBerry (BB) jumped 24% to their best levels since June 2013 in large part as the one-time smartphone leader signed a deal with Chinese internet giant Baidu (BIDU) to work together on automotive software for self-driving vehicles.A Goldilocks jobs report for December quieted talk that labor markets are at risk of overheating. Payrolls rose a moderate 148,000, well below the 190,000 expected, as the jobless rate held at 4.1% and average hourly wage gains remained stuck at 2.5%. The data may help Federal Reserve policymakers follow a slow pace of interest rate hikes, at least for now. Yet other indications suggest the economy ended the year with a strong head of steam. Holiday sales were strong. And the ISM manufacturing index unexpectedly rose 1.5 points to 59.7, signaling accelerating factory growth. The new orders gauge vaulted to a 15-year high of 69.4, up from a robust 64.0 the prior month.Macy's (M) Nov.-Dec. same-store sales unexpectedly rose 1.1% — the first holiday gain in three years — and J.C. Penney (JCP) comps up 2.4%. But amid more Macy's store closures, shares of both stocks nevertheless tumbled. Elsewhere, Costco Wholesale (COST) core same-store sales popped 8.8% and Zumiez (ZUMZ) comps jumped 7.9%, both topping views. Victoria's Secret parent L Brands (LB) fell short of comp forecasts and cut its earnings target. Ollie's Bargain Outlet (OLLI) said holiday same-store sales increased 3.9% and implied Q4 EPS would edge past views.Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) narrowly beat Q1 expectations with $1.28 EPS on $30.7 billion in revenue. U.S. retail pharmacy sales grew 8.9% as comps rose 4.7%. The drugstore chain lifted the bottom end of full-year EPS guidance. Shares fell 5.2% Thursday but were up a fraction for the week. Rite Aid (RAD) met views for a 2-cent-a-share loss vs. a year earlier 2-cent gain. Revenue from continuing operations fell nearly 6% to $5.35 billion, including a 3% retail pharmacy sales drop and 12% pharmacy service revenue decline. Shares dipped 1.4% on Thursday but rose for the week. CVS Health (CVS) said Q4 EPS would come in at the low end of its $1.88-$1.92 forecast, but said tax cuts would boost cash flow. Shares jumped 8.2% for the week.Delta Air Lines (DAL) tweaked its Q4 cost forecast higher, partly due to the massive outage last month in its Atlanta hub, and held to its Q4 unit-revenue and margin outlook. Delta expects a one-time hit of $150 million-$200 million in the fourth quarter due to Trump's tax bill. American Airlines (AAL), Southwest Airlines (LUV) and JetBlue (JBLU) said they'd give employees $1,000 each following the tax cuts. Southwest also said it would invest in modernizing its Boeing (BA) fleet.Winning high rollers reportedly weighed on December casino revenue, which came in light at 14.6% growth vs. Bloomberg views for 20% gains. But Macau gross gaming revenue still got a 19.1% bump for the year, in line with consensus per Reuters and the first annual gain since 2013. Wynn Resorts (WYNN) and Las Vegas Sands (LVS) fell more than 2% for the week, while MGM Resorts International (MGM), which is more Vegas-centric, climbed 1.5%.MoneyGram International (MGI) fell 6.8% for the week after the U.S. government rejected a takeover by Alibaba (BABA) affiliate Ant Financial, on national security grounds.Dominion Energy (D) agreed to buy Scana (SCG) battered by a failed nuclear project, for $7.9 billion or $14.6 billion including assumed debt.Constellation Brands (STX) unexpectedly reported a slim per-share profit rise and set a $3 billion stock buyback.

140,COP,"Futures for the S&P 500 index were little changed late Wednesday. The major averages edged lower during the regular session. Diamondback Energy (FANG) cleared a buy point in double-normal volume. Meanwhile, Apple (AAPL) has pulled back since edging past an entry in so-so trade. Fellow Dow industrial components Microsoft (MSFT), Walt Disney (DIS) and Pfizer (PFE) have retreated back into their bases after getting an inflated boostX Volume is sometimes overlooked by investors. But it's a key indicator of institutional support. It's good to see volume rising at least 40%-50% above normal on a breakout. Low-volume breakouts can succeed, but the odds are much lower.S&P 500 and Dow futures rose slightly vs. fair value. Nasdaq 100 futures fell 0.1%.Diamondback Energy rose 4.9% to 117.24 in Wednesday's stock market trading, blasting above a 115.03 flat-base buy point. Volume was 110% above the 50-day moving average, and really picked up in the afternoon.There's no guarantee that Diamondback's move will succeed. Several recent Diamondback breakouts failed or went nowhere. But the strong volume is positive. And there are reasons to be encouraged beyond the price-and-volume action.The shale operator has five straight quarters of strong earnings growth. Analysts predict a 56% EPS gain in the current quarter. Crude futures at two-year highs also bodes well going forward.Oil and gas groups dominated IBD's top-performing industries on Wednesday, with mining and steel also faring well. Shale and other energy plays dominated the S&P 500's biggest winners.Several energy stocks are closing in on buy points. That includes fellow shale plays Concho Resources (CXO) and EOG Resources (EOG), as well as oil majors such as Chevron (CVX), ConocoPhillips (COP), BP (BP) and Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA).Diamondback was added to IBD's Leaderboard on Wednesday.Apple rose 1.4% to 176.34 on Monday, just nudging past a 176.24 base-on-base entry. But volume was just 8% above normal. A Nomura downgrade pushed the iPhone maker below its entry on Tuesday, with Apple nudging down 0.1% on Wednesday to 174.35.If Apple retakes that 176.34 entry in bullish trade, the chart would look a lot more inviting.Microsoft, Pfizer and Disney are exceptions that prove the rule on volume's importance. They all moved into buy range on Friday in powerful volume. But last Friday was a triple-witching expiration day, pushing up market volume sharply.

142,COP,"The House re-approved the $1.5 trillion Trump tax cuts Wednesday after the Senate OK'd the measure in the morning with a 51-48 vote. The bill now heads to President Trump's desk. The House had to revisit Tuesday's vote due to procedural issues.X Now the focus on Wall Street is figuring out just how big of a bonanza the new 21% corporate tax rate will be for corporate America and how much of a boost to earnings investors should expect.On Monday, Goldman Sachs said that Wells Fargo (WFC) stands to gain the most among the biggest U.S. banks from the tax package, with a 17% earnings boost. Beyond the corporate rate cut, the legislation also limits the deductibility of FDIC premiums and limits the ability of companies to deduct past losses, which would hit Citigroup the hardest. After Wells Fargo, Goldman sees PNC Financial Services (PNC) and Bank of America (BAC) as the biggest winners, with expected earnings increases of 15% and 14%.BofA Merrill Lynch analyst Kenneth Bruce upgraded credit-card issuers Capital One Financial (COF), Discover Financial Services (DFS) and Synchrony Financial (SYF) to neutral from buy on Monday and reiterated a buy rating on American Express (AXP), saying tax legislation wasn't fully priced in to the stocks. Bruce sees a 15%-25% boost to EPS, with Discover and Synchrony near the top of the range and Capital One and AmEx both poised for a 17% EPS increase.Delta Air Lines (DAL) CEO Ed Bastian told analysts last week that a 21% corporate tax rate would cut its tax bill by $800 million a year, the Financial Times reported. The tax legislation would boost Delta's 2018 earnings by $1 per share above current guidance of $5.35 to $5.70 per share. That amounts to roughly an 18% EPS bump. Beyond the lower corporate rate, airlines will benefit from being able to immediately deduct the cost of aircraft purchases. Data from IBD's parent corporation, William O'Neil & Co., show that Alaska Air Group (ALK) has the highest effective tax rate, 38%, among U.S. airlines.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column every day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines. As long as the current ""confirmed uptrend"" — the equivalent of a green light — stays in place, leading stocks breaking above a buy point are more likely than not to have the wind at their backs. Here's a good place to start looking for stocks that may be poised to move higher.""Companies with businesses that are primarily domestic-focused tend to have higher tax rates on average. Similarly, small-cap stocks, which are generally more U.S.-centric, could see strong earnings revisions,"" wrote William O'Neil chief investment strategist Randy Watts and senior equity analyst Romeo Alvarez. Among S&P 500 sectors, ""Energy currently has the highest corporate tax rate and would see major relief.""The data show Marathon Oil (MRO) with a 49.9% effective tax rate and ConocoPhillips (COP) paying a 46.9% rate.Energy stocks were big winners Thursday. Conoco Philips jumped 3%, nearly breaking out to a buy zone on the stock market today. Marathon Oil was among the many energy stocks moving toward entry points. Diamondback Energy (FANG) did blast out into buy range in strong volume.CVS Health (CVS) has a 38.9% effective tax rate, tops among consumer staples companies, according to William O'Neil data. Aetna (AET), another high-tax company, is being acquired by CVS as it braces for the entry of Amazon.com into the retail prescription business. CEO Larry Merlo said recently that CVS would take some of its tax windfall and reinvest it in reconfiguring its stores to provide more health services.RELATED:6 Big Rule Changes For Individuals In The New Tax BillTrump Tax Package Seen Boosting These Players In Info TechHere's How Much Trump Tax Cuts Will Boost Profits At These Banking GiantsFederal Reserve Gives Trump Tax Cuts A Green LightFive Reasons Why JPMorgan, Citigroup, Other Financials Are Seizing Market Leadership

"
146,COP,"GQ magazine named former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick its 2017 ""Citizen of the Year."" In doing so, GQ overlooked NFL Houston Texans' J.J. Watt, who raised some $37 million for hurricane relief. Many of Kaepernick's supporters liken his protest to that of boxer Muhammad Ali, who refused to be inducted into the military. The comparison is not well-taken.For whatever reason, Kaepernick chose not to give the magazine an interview, passing up an opportunity to clearly explain the purpose of his protest. At first, Kaepernick insisted his protest was about the alleged epidemic of police brutality against blacks. Shortly after he started his protest, Kaepernick said: ""There's a lot of things that need to change. One specifically is police brutality. There's people being murdered unjustly and not being held accountable. The cops are getting paid leave for killing people. That's not right.""Contrast this with Muhammad Ali's protest. He argued that his religious beliefs made him a conscientious objector who ought not be forced to join the military. In doing so, Ali faced up to five years in prison and was stripped of his ability to fight in the U.S. for more than three years, his prime years as an athlete. While the heavyweight title-holder avoided prison during his appeals process — which ended up in the Supreme Court — he was forced to hand over his passport, which prevented him from fighting overseas, as well.XBanned from boxing and stripped of his world heavyweight title, Ali argued his case on the road, speaking at a number of colleges and universities, where he repeatedly stated that he would rather abide by his religious convictions than violate them in order to make money. Martin Luther King Jr. urged his followers to ""admire (Ali's) courage. He is giving up fame. He is giving up millions of dollars to do what his conscience tells him is right.""By contrast, Kaepernick wants to have it both ways. The NFL allows players to stand or not, depending upon their own choice. So the league actually gives players permission to stand or not to stand for the national anthem. In Ali's case, his refusal to join the military cost him the ability to earn a living in his chosen profession.The Supreme Court eventually sided unanimously with Ali, ruling that the appeal board failed to properly specify the reason why Ali's application for a conscientious-objector exemption had been denied. The ruling required Ali's conviction to be overturned, and the court said the record shows that Ali's ""beliefs are founded on tenets of the Muslim religion as he understands them."" After his Supreme Court victory, Ali could have sued for lost wages, arguing that he was illegally forbidden from working as a fighter. Ali refused, arguing that he would rather look ahead then exact revenge.Kaepernick, on the other hand, filed a grievance against the NFL, claiming the owners ""colluded"" against hiring this mediocre-quarterback-turned-locker-room distraction.What about the merits of Kaepernick's argument? Is there an epidemic of police brutality against blacks? The answer is no.According to the Centers for Disease Control, police shootings against blacks have declined almost 75% since 1968. Of the 963 people shot and killed by police in 2016, 233 were black, and 466 were white. Most people could not name a white person killed by the police, because the media are far less interested in a white person killed by a cop than a black person killed by one. Last year, a grand total of 17 unarmed blacks were killed by the police, according to The Washington Post. Contrast this with the approximately 6,000 to 7,000 blacks killed annually, almost all — as many as 90% — by other blacks. Where is Kaepernick on the fact that the No. 1 cause of preventable death for young blacks is homicide, while the No. 1 cause of preventable death for young white men is ""unintentional injuries,"" or accidents?San Antonio Spurs coach Gregg Popovich, who supports Kaepernick, said: ""It's easier for white people because we haven't lived that experience. It's difficult for many white people to understand the day-to-day feeling that many black people have to deal with. ...""When somebody like Kaepernick brings attention to this, and others who have, it makes people have to face the issue because it's too easy to let it go because it's not their daily experience. If it's not your daily experience, you don't understand it.""As to Popovich's assertion about the ""day-to-day feeling that many black people have to deal with,"" what of the 1997 Time/CNN poll that found 89% of black teens found little or no racism in their day-to-day lives? And more black teens than white teens agreed that ""failure to take advantage of available opportunities"" was a bigger problem than racism. And this was 20 years ago, before the election and re-election of a black President.Kaepernick's protest was bogus from the start, and it only helped to create greater unnecessary tension between the black community and the police.

149,COP,"The war on cops is moving from the streets to the U.S. Supreme Court. Last week, the Justices heard a case that threatens police officers with financial ruin if they make arrests, and the charges later get dropped.It started with a late night bash. District of Columbia police officers were called by neighbors at 1 a.m. to investigate a rowdy party at an unoccupied row house. The police found 21 partygoers, liquor, trash and used condoms strewn about, along with the smell of marijuana and women with cash coming out of their pants. The partygoers scattered, hiding in closets.When questioned, some told police ""Peaches had invited them."" Some gave other stories. The police phoned ""Peaches,"" who admitted to not having the owner's permission to use the house. The police then called the owner, who confirmed no one had permission. Two hours after being summoned, the police made the decision to arrest the party-goers for trespassing — the judgment call an issue in this case.The charges were later dropped, because it wasn't clear beyond a reasonable doubt the party-goers knew they were trespassing. But 16 turned around and sued the police for false arrest and violating their constitutional rights.They never claimed the police verbally or physically abused them. They sued simply for having been arrested, cuffed and hauled to the police station. Amazingly, the lower courts slapped the police with nearly $1 million in damages and legal fees — one of numerous recent lower court decisions making cops personally liable for decisions they made on duty.The justices should put a stop to it. Fortunately, the Court has a long record of protecting the police from legal liability, provided there's no evidence of malice or a deliberate violation of the Constitution.If merely making an arrest puts cops at risk of getting sued and clobbered with legal fees and damage awards, what police officer will ever make an arrest? One mistake could mean losing their home and everything else. Faced with that risk, who would ever want to be a cop?Twenty-six states and the federal Justice Department are weighing in with a strong warning that allowing the lower court ruling to stand would have ""vast consequences"" for law enforcement everywhere. On the other side, the American Civil Liberties Union is pushing to shrink or even eliminate the police's legal immunity. The ACLU wants police to have no room for error.Last week's oral argument signals how the Justices are likely to vote. Justice Stephen Breyer sympathized with the partygoers, suggesting it's out of ""the Middle Ages"" to expect them to know who's hosting. Justice Elena Kagan bragged she herself had gone to parties without knowing who the host was and where ""marijuana was maybe present.""Justice Sonia Sotomayor was determined to play the race card, though race wasn't raised by either side. She asked ""if police officers arrived at a wealthy home and it was white teenagers having a party ... I doubt very much those kids would be arrested.""  Shame on Sotomayor.Neighbors called the cops because they were concerned about the debauchery going on next door to them. Of course, people in an upscale neighborhood would do the same. Rich people and poor people, black and white alike, want police protection and quiet enjoyment of their homes.That protection is being eroded. You can thank Black Lives Matter street protests and pandering politicians. Manhattan Institute scholar Heather MacDonald reports a nationwide slowdown in policing, because cops are feeling vulnerable and hesitating to make arrests. That means the war on cops is hurting all of us.A majority of the Justices seem to get that. The Court's newest member, Justice Neil Gorsuch, has frequently cautioned against courts ""second-guessing"" police for the actions they take in ""tense, uncertain, and rapidly evolving circumstances."" That's why the Court should rule in favor of legal immunity for the police. Our public safety depends on it.

150,COP,"Moira Smith was selfless in the line of duty. Whether sprinting several levels of New York City's subway system to aid victims of a terrible derailment, or chasing down an armed-robbery suspect on her lunch break, or racing to the World Trade Center on 9/11, she was fulfilling a childhood goal of helping others by becoming a police officer.As an officer in the New York Police Department, Smith was doing just that on 9/11 — helping to evacuate people from the World Trade Center's south tower — when it collapsed.In all, nearly 3,000 people died on Sept. 11, 2001, in the attacks carried out by 19 al-Qaida terrorists who hijacked four commercial jets. Two of the jets smashed into the 110-story twin towers of the World Trade Center. Another was flown into the Pentagon and the last one crashed in Shanksville, Pa., when heroic passengers, aware of what had transpired with the other flights, fought the hijackers.Along with 343 firefighters who were killed, Smith, 38, was among 72 law enforcement personnel who died in the attacks.""(Moira) was so compassionate, so serious about her work,"" said NYPD Sgt. Mary Young in the book, ""Women at Ground Zero,"" by Susan Hagen and Mary Carouba. ""Nothing could have stopped her from running into that building to help save lives on September 11. Nothing.""Smith left behind her husband, Jim Smith, also a police officer, and their then-2-year-old daughter Patricia.""What Moira did on Sept. 11 wasn't a one-time thing,"" Jim Smith said. ""That's who Moira was. That's what Moira did every day. She wasn't reckless, but she never backed down.""It's estimated that New York firefighters, with support from the police, were able to evacuate 30,000 people from the twin towers.Moira Smith alone was credited with saving hundreds of lives. Three months after her death she was posthumously awarded NYPD's Medal of Honor, and in 2012 a playground in Madison Square Park, where Smith regularly patrolled, was officially named ""PO Moira Smith Playground.""""Moira was a terrific cop,"" Jim Smith told IBD. ""She did her job and she had fun while she did it. She was brave and honest. Moira loved her daughter; Patricia was her whole world, her biggest joy in life. She was a great mom and wife.""Kathleen Conaghan, a close friend of Moira Smith since they were 5 years old, said she ""valued life so much and she enjoyed hers so much. She walked into a room and the lights went on. She filled a room with fun and love and laughter. ""Moira Smith was born Moira Reddy on Valentine's Day 1963 in the Bay Ridge section of New York's borough of Brooklyn.Since her last name was pronounced ""ready,"" Moira liked to say she was ""Reddy for anything,"" Conaghan said.As a seventh-grader, Moira rescued a young girl from drowning in a camp pool during a swimming test. She'd spotted her even before a lifeguard had.""My mother was very selfless, nothing could get in her way when it came to helping someone else,"" Patricia Smith, now 18, said to IBD. ""And that started before she was a police officer, that was throughout her entire life.""Moira attended Niagara University in upstate New York and majored in criminal justice. When her mother became ill, she helped care for her until her death. After college, Moira attended the New York Police Academy and became an NYPD officer in December 1988.It was there she met Jim Smith. The colleagues became friends, then fell in love and married. They enjoyed sporting events, taking road trips and traveling abroad.Moira and Jim Smith eventually became members of the transit police. On Aug. 28, 1991, Jim was waiting on a subway platform for the train home after his shift ended when Moira, who'd already worked a full day, raced by him. He ran after her.There had been a horrific train derailment at Union Station caused by a drunken motorman, and Moira Smith may have well been the first officer on the scene.For the next 12 hours, the Smiths and their colleagues rescued passengers from the mangled four-car train, and administered first aid. Of its 216 passengers, five died in the crash and 161 were injured.After working 24 straight hours, Moira Smith herself had to go to the hospital for smoke inhalation.The Smiths were awarded Distinguished Duty Medals from the NYPD for their lifesaving efforts.The last day of Smith's life began at 5 a.m. Assigned to a community policing unit, she was stationed at Sixth Avenue and 17th Street in Manhattan, covering a labor protest. Jim Smith was at home,  taking care of Patricia, with his shift scheduled to begin at 4 p.m.The clear New York City morning was suddenly interrupted by the piercing sound of a jet traveling far too fast for how low it was flying.At 8:46 a.m. Smith witnessed American Airlines Flight 11, a Boeing 767 commandeered by five terrorists, slam into the north tower of the World Trade Center, between the 93rd and 97th floors. The jet's 10,000 gallons of fuel ignited on impact, creating an inferno.Smith is credited with being the first police officer to report what she saw; calling the Communications Division so it could notify others. Next she took witnesses to the 13th Precinct for statements and to be interviewed.After dropping the witnesses off, Smith was joined by a couple of other police officers as she got into a van racing to the World Trade Center.""She could have stayed at the precinct,"" Hagen wrote, ""but that wasn't Moira's way.""The World Trade Center was teaming with firefighters in the midst of horrendous chaos. Bodies, blood and debris were in the plaza, where people trapped above the north tower's impact zone were jumping to their deaths rather than be burned alive.Smith went to the underground concourse to help evacuate people and direct them to safety.Then at 9:01 a.m. United Airlines Flight 175, another Boeing 767, seized by five other terrorists, slammed into the south tower between floors 77 and 85, igniting that aircraft's 10,000 gallons of fuel.""We knew something enormous had happened because the building shook and the temperature rose by 10 degrees in an instant,"" south tower survivor Martin Glynn wrote on moirasmith.com. He and others in a panicked crowd tediously made their way down the building.Smith now ran into the south tower lobby and started helping people evacuate the stricken tower. As they moved to its lower level, its occupants could see from large atrium windows that the north tower was engulfed in flames and smoke above the impact zone.""A slow-moving line progressed along the ramp to a down escalator which connected to the underground passageway being used to exit the compound,"" Glynn wrote.Smith was trying to keep people moving out of the building in an urgent-but-orderly fashion, and prevent mass hysteria that could cause a stampede or bottleneck. People looking through the windows at the terrible scene caused a shocked standstill.""Moira stood at the end of the ramp directing the traffic down the escalator,"" Glynn said. ""She had her flashlight in her right hand and she was waving it. … She was repeating over and over: `Don't look! Keep moving.'""I came to the end of the ramp and I was standing squarely in front of Moira. I leaned to the left to try to look past her to see the plaza. She quickly matched my motion and blocked my vision saying `don't look.' ""Glynn said the mass of people trying to exit the building felt a calm assurance from Smith, ""that they were being directed by someone in authority who was in control of the situation. … She insulated the evacuees from the awareness of the dangerous situation they were in, with the result that everything (proceeded) smoothly.""When Smith learned that a woman was having an asthma attack, she made her way up the building to aid her, reaching the second or third floor before the south tower collapsed at 9:59 a.m. At 10:28 a.m., the north tower followed.The New York Daily News published a now-famous photo of Smith helping a bloodied and battered man, Edward Nicholls, to a triage center at some point before she went back inside.As quoted in ""Women in Blue,"" by Cheryl Mullenbach, he said of Smith: ""No words are appropriate. She showed tremendous courage — and made the ultimate sacrifice. A heart of gold.""Glynn said several of his colleagues in the south tower remember Smith directing traffic at the escalator landing.""Until every person was out, I knew Moira would be there,"" said her longtime friend, Conaghan.""She just really wanted to help people, that's what she was about,"" Patricia Smith said.In March 2002, Moira Smith's remains were recovered. Her NYPD shield is preserved in the National 9/11 Museum at the World Trade Center.""I never saw Moira as a victim,"" Jim Smith said. ""She was someone who wanted to go there, who knew what she was doing, who made a choice. I don't see it as a tragedy as much as I see it as a sacrifice.""NYPD officer, 1988-2001.

151,COP,"Chevron (CVX) and Exxon Mobil (XOM) signaled Friday that they are moving ahead with plans to boost activity in the Permian Basin, despite signs of another slowdown in the U.S. oil patch.XChevron, which is the Permian's largest net acreage holder with about 2 million net acres, plans to add a drilling rig there every 8-10 weeks and have at total of 20 by the end of 2018.Investments in basin have greater than 30% returns with U.S. crude prices at $50 a barrel, said Chevron's upstream vice president, Jay Johnson, who also said Permian earnings should grow on lower operating costs and depreciation rates.On Friday, West Texas Intermediate futures rose 1.4% to $49.71 a barrel, capping an 8.6% weekly gain.And as Chevron's large capital projects mature and roll off its budget, Johnson said Chevron can shift discretionary capital to the Permian over the next several years, noting that the company is ""not holding back capital"" to the basin.Meanwhile, Exxon plans to add three drilling rigs to the Permian by the end of next month, bringing its total there to 19. In January, Exxon announced that it would double its holdings in the Permian by purchasing $5.6 billion in assets in the Delaware section of the basin.Still, as U.S. oil production and drilling activity have seen some declines in recent weeks, management sounded cautious on the outlook for the oil market overall.""We're seeing some progress towards a healthier balance, but there are a lot of variables in play,"" Jeff Woodbury, vice president of investor relations and secretary for Exxon Mobil, told analysts on a conference call.The bullish outlook on the Permian comes as some U.S. producers are pulling back on investment following the latest slump in oil prices. On Monday, Anadarko Petroleum (APC) said it would cut its 2017 capital spending outlook by $300 million. And on Thursday, ConocoPhillips (COP) cut its capex guidance by 4%. On Friday, Woodbury said Exxon has ""flexibility"" in its capital program.Exxon shares were down 1.5% at 79.60 on the stock market today, while Chevron climbed 1.9% to 108.12 on strong Q2 results.In Q2, Exxon's EPS jumped 90% to 78 cents, but that missed estimates of 83 cents, according to Zacks Investment Research. Revenue climbed 9% to $62.88 billion, above views for $61.16 billion.Earnings from upstream operations, which include exploration and production, were $1.2 billion, up by $890 million from a year ago. Earnings from downstream operations, which include refining, were $1.4 billion, up by $560 million from a year ago. Production dipped 1% to 3.9 million oil-equivalent barrels per day, and capital spending fell 24% to $3.9 billion.Chevron's adjusted EPS also surged 90%, hitting 91 cents and beating views by 2 cents, and revenue grew 18% to $34.48 billion, above estimates for $31.18 billion.Upstream operations swung to a profit of $853 million from a year-ago loss of $2.46 billion, while downstream earnings slipped 6.5% to $1.2 billion. Production rose 10% to 2.78 billion oil-equivalent barrels a day, with record production seen from its Permian Basin assets.

Chevron advanced 0.9% to 106.11.While companies in the oil and gas space have reported strong Q2 results, there are warnings signs of impending trouble in the shale sector, with oil prices trading below $50 a barrel for months.On Monday, oilfield services giant Halliburton (HAL) warned about a slow down in U.S. rig counts.Also Monday, Anadarko Petroleum (APC) said it would cut its 2017 capital spending outlook by $300 million, becoming the first U.S. producer to do so. Then on Thursday, ConocoPhillips (COP) cut its capex by 4% after reporting a Q2 earnings beat.Now the oil majors who got into shale could do the same.""Some of these bigger companies have been looking to shale as lower risk, higher return projects to make quick buck,"" said Phil Flynn, a senior market analyst at the Price Futures Group. ""Now some of these companies are finding out that the shale game isn't as neat and pretty as they thought it would be.""Both Exxon and Chevron have touted new holdings and increased capital spending in the Permian basin in Texas.But the increased spending could end soon.""We saw warnings on Exxon from S&P a few months ago saying that they still need to do more capital spending cuts to keep credit rating up,"" Flynn said. ""That's what I'm looking for on earnings. I want to see how lean and mean these guys are going to have to get. The leaner and meaner they get, the higher the price of oil goes.""But with gasoline demand rising, oil majors, unlike their E&P peers, have refining on their side to help boost their Q2 results.""If you're in refining you're doing pretty well,"" Flynn said. ""Refining margins saved Shell. Exploration and production is the weak spot.""On Thursday, Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) reported Q2 revenue above Wall Street estimates and vowed to ""remain very disciplined"" in the face of lower oil prices.Royal Dutch Shell shares rose 1.4% to 55.28 intraday, approaching a 56.35 buy point in a cup-with-handle base that started in early January.ConocoPhillips stock rose 2.2% and Anadarko 4.8%, while Halliburton fell 0.5%.CEO Ben van Beurden predicted that oil consumption would peak in the 2030s as the use of electric vehicles rise or peak in the late 2020s if biofuels are aggressively added.U.S. crude futures rose 0.6% to close at $49.04 a barrel, their highest level in about two months amid signs that shale production is peaking. Crude inventories tumbled last week while domestic output fell, the Energy Information Administration said Wednesday.RELATED: Oil Rises For Third Day As U.S. Stockpiles Tumble, Production Falls

153,COP,"Civil Society: There is no excuse for murdering innocents, and all terrorist attacks should be roundly condemned. That should be a simple proposition everyone can agree on. What isn't so simple or agreeable is the immediate attempt to politicize this tragedy.President Trump was getting attacked — and rightly so — for issuing a mealy mouthed statement in the immediate wake of the attack by a white supremacist who plowed his car into a crowd of counter-protestors in Charlottesville, Va., killing one and injuring more than a dozen others.By Monday morning, however, Trump made an impromptu statement at the White House, saying ""we condemn in the strongest possible terms this display of hatred, bigotry and violence. Racism is evil, and those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs, including the KKK, neo-Nazis, white supremacists and other hate groups that are repugnant to what we hold dear as Americans.""Naturally, that led to complaints that, well, yeah, Trump said what we wanted him to, but he waited too long. And as usual, there's a fervent attempt by the left and the media to fatuously claim that Republicans and conservatives are all guilty by association.Sure, Trump could have, and should have, forcefully condemned white supremacists in his initial statement. After all, he had repeatedly berated President Obama for not saying the words ""radical Islamic terrorists,"" making his own reluctance look like a glaring double standard.But if we're going to talk about double standards, let's at least be fair about it. The truth is that the left is just as guilty, if not more so, of this particular failing. When a violent event fits a liberal narrative it sparks wails of outrage, makes the front page news, gets talked about 24/7 on cable news. But if it doesn't fit that narrative — for example, the targeting of Republicans by a deranged liberal, or vicious attacks by leftists on Trump supporters, death threats to conservatives, etc. — the left can barely muster any reaction at all.Obama never mentioned the anti-cop sentiment fomented by Black Lives Matter — with an assist from Obama himself — in his brief statement after five police officers were assassinated in Dallas. Obama did find room in those remarks to mention racist cops. Did anyone on the left complain?Obama also took it as a point of pride never to say ""radical Islamic terrorism,"" calling it a ""sort of manufactured"" issue. And the same talking heads who were braying at Trump for not specifically attacking ""white supremacists"" backed Obama up on this, lecturing the country about how names don't matter and how labeling terrorists as such would only incite more people to join their ranks.Meanwhile, look at how conservatives reacted to the Charlottesville murder. They immediately and forcefully condemned it, and criticized Trump's anemic initial response. National Review blasted Trump for being ""vague and equivocal.""Sens. Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio were incredibly forceful in their denunciations. And in response, New York Times reporter Eric Lipton suggested in a tweet that they weren't being sincere, but were just trying to position themselves for the 2020 elections.Cruz had a devastating comeback to Lipton's outrageous slur, tweeting: ""Gosh, you're right. Because Nazis & the Klan have such love for Cuban-Americans. If only we worked for a paper that shilled for Stalin ...""For the record, we'd like nothing more than to see the perpetrator, or perpetrators, of the Charlottesville attack rot in prison, or better yet, take their last breath in a gas chamber.In the meantime, we could do without the automatic inclination to politicize everything that walks or crawls.RELATED:Trump's Critics Are Praying That John Kelly FailsSomeone Just Noticed That Trump Is Getting Stuff DoneDemocrats' Real, Pervasive Collusion With Russia Somehow Lost In Media's Hysterical Anti-Trump Campaign

162,COP,"PBS NewsHour aired a story last year about Milwaukee, saying many residents call the city ""the worst place to be a black man in America."" It talked about last year's riots in the city after a cop shot a black man. One black Milwaukee resident explained that this is ""what happens when you inflict poverty"" on poor black residents. ""Inflict poverty""?In the 50 years following President Lyndon Johnson's launch of the ""war on poverty"" in 1964, government spent over $22 trillion on welfare and various anti-poverty programs. The problem in our nation's inner cities is not a lack of money — it is a moral and spiritual problem largely created by our welfare state. The welfare system encourages women to marry the government and allows men to abandon their financial and moral responsibilities. The problem is fatherlessness.In a documentary called ""Resurrection,"" rapper Tupac Shakur, who said, ""I never knew where my father was or who my father was for sure,"" actually admitted: ""I know for a fact that had I had a father, I'd have some discipline. I'd have more confidence. Your mother cannot calm you down the way a man can. Your mother can't reassure you the way a man can. My mother couldn't show me where my manhood was. You need a man to teach you how to be a man.""In 1995, President Bill Clinton, who pledged to end ""welfare as we know it,"" gave a speech described by a Los Angeles Times writer as ""the most sweeping analysis of racial issues of his presidency."" On the day of the ""March on Washington,"" Clinton said black men must take more responsibility for their behavior: ""Today's march is ... also about black men taking renewed responsibility for themselves, their families and their communities. It's about saying no to crime and drugs and violence. It's about standing up for atonement and reconciliation. It's about insisting that others do the same and offering to help them. It's about the frank admission that unless black men shoulder their load, no one else can help them or their brothers, their sisters and their children escape the hard, bleak lives that too many of them still face. ... It's not racist for whites to assert that the culture of welfare dependency, out-of-wedlock pregnancy and absent fatherhood cannot be broken by social programs, unless there is first more personal responsibility.""In my book, ""The Ten Things You Can't Say In America,"" I wrote about a wealthy, idealistic Philadelphia philanthropist. Committed, concerned and worried about the future of urban — primarily black — kids, he ""adopted"" 112 inner-city sixth-graders, most of whom were products of broken homes. He promised these students that if they met minimal requirements, including graduating from high school and not getting pregnant or impregnating somebody — he'd pay for all their education, including college tuition.He provided tutors, workshops, after-school programs and summer programs, as well as counselors to be available when trouble arose, whether personal or otherwise.Thirteen years later, The Philadelphia Inquirer followed up on the 112 kids and analyzed the results. The percentage of kids going to college was no greater than percentage of kids from similar backgrounds without prepaid educations. The money was wasted.Forty-five never made it through high school. Of these, 35 dropped out, one died while in school, four died after dropping out, four were working on a GED and one graduated from trade school.Of the high school graduates, 13 were four-year college graduates, 11 were enrolled in four-year college, five were enrolled in two-year college, 12 had dropped out of two- and four-year colleges, seven graduated trade school, eight were enrolled in trade school, six dropped out of trade school and five got no further education.Of the 67 boys, 19 grew into adult felons. Among the 45 girls, they had 63 children, and more than half had babies before age 18.What do we make of this? The answer is simple: It's not about money. It's about values. It's about discipline and application. It's about character — about working hard when you don't want to. And these values are instilled in the home.The first step is the truth.As long as blacks feel and act oppressed, as if they are under siege and behind enemy lines, little will change. The formula is simple, but it requires effort: hard work wins; you get out of life what you put into it; you cannot control the outcome, but you are 100% in control of the effort. Go to school, study, work hard, arrive early, stay late, pay attention to detail and be honest. That is the best ""anti-poverty program"" ever conceived.

163,COP,"Oil majors Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) as well as a slew of energy companies are gushing their best profits in years, yet crude prices are plunging again to levels last seen in November, clouding the outlook for dividends.Will glimmers of a profit recovery in the troubled energy sector mean a rush to plow money back to shareholders? Or will weakness in oil prices keep shareholder returns muted?""First and foremost, oil prices need to improve"" before the energy sector's dividends and buybacks return to historical levels, said Lindsey Bell, investment strategist at CFRA Research. ""Energy earnings are very highly correlated to energy prices. With oil prices at $45 a barrel, it will be very hard for those stocks to perform.""Grant Engelbart, a portfolio manager at CLS Investments, agrees that rebounding oil prices will be key to energy companies' profitability — and therefore their ability to pay dividends and buy back shares.At the same time, he notes that no energy company has actually cut dividends this earnings season and a few — including Exxon, Phillips 66 (PSX) and Cabot Oil & Gas (COG) — actually raised dividends.""We think dividend cuts have probably come to an end, and companies that have mandates to raise dividends will continue to do so,"" Engelbart said in a phone call.The latest reports reveal energy companies have done a good job navigating the new landscape by cutting back expenditures during the price bust and holding off on massive outlays with the rebound, he added.Helped by cost cuts, Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) pumped out $9.5 billion in cash flow, which the Anglo-Dutch giant used to cover dividends for a third straight quarter and reduce debt in Q1.Yellow flags remain. Revenue for Exxon was worse than expected in the first quarter, and Chevron kept its dividend unchanged even as Exxon raised its payout. The two companies alone account for nearly 40% of the S&P 500 energy sector's market cap.The energy sector will also face tougher year-over-year comparisons over the course of 2017, making earnings growth less dramatic.Oil and gas companies floundered in the ugly commodity collapse of 2014-15. By early 2016, with a hoped-for rebound yet to materialize and their profits cratering, the likes of ConocoPhillips (COP), Kinder Morgan (KMI), Anadarko Petroleum (APC)  and Chesapeake Energy (CHK) were forced to slash dividend payouts.  In some cases, as stock prices plunged, dividend yields spiked as much as 12%.Even Exxon, the world's biggest oil company, was forced to borrow money to pay out dividends. Smaller-cap energy companies struggled the most to increase or maintain their dividend payments.Share buybacks, a form of shareholder returns that is easier for companies to turn on and off than dividends, were pared back even more.For 2016 as a whole, the energy sector represented 1.1% of all S&P 500 buybacks vs. 2.7% in 2015 and 7.4% in 2014, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. It contributed 9.1% to S&P 500 dividends  in 2016 vs. 10.56% the previous year.In the fourth quarter of 2016, the combined dividend yield and buyback yield for the energy sector was 3.19% — the lowest of all 11 S&P 500 sectors.Exxon, which has grown dividends for 35 years in a row, is now no longer the biggest dividend payer in the S&P 500.Apple (AAPL), which started paying dividends in 2012 and has been hiking payouts aggressively, is the new king. The iPhone maker on May 2 hiked its quarterly dividend by 10.5% to 63 cents, taking its annual dividends to $13.22 billion vs. $12.77 billion for Exxon.Still, dividend yields for energy stocks are more attractive. With Apple stock hitting new highs, the dividend yield is just 1.6%, less than half of Exxon's 3.7% and Chevron's 4%.Apple also has replaced Exxon as ""the poster child for buybacks"" in recent years, according to Howard Silverblatt of S&P Dow Jones Indices. Apple buybacks in 2016 totaled $33.71 billion, making it the second largest S&P 500 company for buybacks, behind Allergan (AGN).Meanwhile, Exxon did not even rank among the top 20 and ""has done very little in the way of buybacks of late,"" Silverblatt wrote recently.Despite some recent good news for shareholders, current prices don't bode well for revenue or payouts.U.S. crude prices settled 3.2% higher Wednesday at $47.33 a barrel, on data showing a sharp drawdown in U.S. inventories. Meanwhile, OPEC and top non-OPEC producers have suggested they will extend production cuts through the end of this year and possibly into 2018.Prices could get a bump from new, aggressive moves by the oil group and its partners to further reduce the global glut of inventories. But that would likely be offset by increased production from U.S. companies.Still, while the top line remains challenged, companies could improve their bottom lines — and their cash flow — by focusing on lower-cost regions like the Permian Basin. U.S. producers have also been using new technologies and techniques that allow them to extract oil profitably, even at lower prices.RELATED:Uh-Oh, OPEC: Top Shale Play Vows Big Output Boost Even With Sub-$50 OilEOG Shows Why It's The 'Apple Of Oil' With Gusher Of Mobile Apps, DataEven This Latest Idea From OPEC May Not Lift Oil Prices As Shale Looms

166,COP,"Do college students — and their parents — truly understand how thoroughly left-wing professors dominate the humanities side of academia?Many people know that most professors are liberal, but the degree to which the left wing rules is jaw-dropping. A study published last September in Econ Journal Watch, ""Faculty Voter Registration in Economics, History, Journalism, Law, and Psychology,"" documents the overwhelming left-wing nature of the voter registration of college profs at 40 leading universities. An examination of voter registration in five departments found that Democrats outnumber Republicans by 11 1/2-to-1. Even in economics, where one would think that views would be driven by data, not politics, Democrats outnumbered Republicans 4 1/2-to-1. History was practically foreign terrain for Republicans, as Democrats outnumbered them 33 1/2-to-1.And it's getting worse. A 1968 study put the Democrat-to-Republican ratio in history departments at 2.7-to-1. This latest study found that among profs 65 and older, Democrats outnumber Republicans by 10 to 1. But for scholars under the age of 36 the ratio is 22.7-to-1.In 2012 the California Association of Scholars published the results of a two-year study about the bias of professors in the University of California system. The study claims that professors' bias ""corrupts"" education, turning schools into indoctrination camps. According to the National Association of Scholars: ""The report documented curricula that promote political activism, in violation of UC regulations. For example, one course aims to be a 'training ground' for 'advocates committed to racial justice theory and practice.'"" The CAS report also cited earlier studies that found that associate and assistant professors, those waiting in the wings, are ever more likely to be registered as Democrats. Among UC Berkeley's associates and assistants, said the report, registered Democrats outnumber registered Republicans by 49-to-1 in (SET ITAL) all (END ITAL) departments — including sciences.What about commencement speakers?Of the political speakers, left-wingers dramatically outnumber conservatives. The student political advocacy group Campus Reform looked at last year's commencement speakers for the top 100 colleges and universities from U.S. News & World Report's annual ranking of best colleges. Of the then-announced speakers associated with political messages, 40 were liberal and 10 conservative, a ratio of 4-to-1 in favor of Democrats.What about political contributions?In the 2012 presidential election, a Campus Reform study found that 96% of the Ivy League's faculty and staffers who made campaign donations sent their checks to Barack Obama. At Brown University, just one professor contributed to Mitt Romney's campaign. Employees of the eight prestigious schools sent more than $1.2 million to President Obama, but contributed just $114,166 to Romney's campaign — a ratio of more than 10-to-1 in favor of Obama.This brings us to what can only be described as Trump Derangement Syndrome, campus style. UC Berkeley claims, in effect, that it cannot protect students and property, therefore ""incendiary"" conservative speakers like Ann Coulter and David Horowitz — who actually attended graduate school there — had to cancel their proposed speeches. Meanwhile, at Claremont McKenna College in California, students blocked entry to those who came to hear pro-cop researcher Heather Mac Donald. ""Activists"" called Mac Donald a ""white supremacist fascist,"" among other things, for researching and concluding that, no, cops are not engaging in illegal racial profiling. At Middlebury College, a professor who co-sponsored the invitation to conservative Charles Murray, which prompted a riot, apologized — to the rioters! Another California human psychology professor called Trump's election ""an act of terrorism.""Dartmouth recently conducted a field survey of nearly 500 of its students and found that 45% of the students who self-identified as Democrats said they would be ""uncomfortable"" rooming with a conservative, while only 12% of Republican students said that they would be ""uncomfortable"" with a liberal roommate.The question is whether left-wing professors create left-wing students. To say there is no effect is to say teachers don't matter. Consider this. In an attempt to quantify the effect of media bias, UCLA economics and political science professor Tim Groseclose writes: ""(The) average voter received approximately 8.2% of his news from Fox, and 79.9% from establishment media (defined as all outlets except Fox, the internet and talk radio). Thus, the 'reach' of establishment media is approximately 10 times that of Fox News."" He says in presidential elections, liberal media bias gives Dems an advantage of eight to 10 points. Were the media truly fair and balanced, concludes Groseclose, the average state would vote the way Texas does.Is it not reasonable to assume that professors have at least some measure of influence on their students? Have many professors crossed the line from education to indoctrination? Will opposing views be tolerated and respected? Does a student run a risk of facing grade retaliation by a Trump-hating poli-sci professor?Campus activists have long complained about ""microaggressions,"" for which they demand ""safe spaces."" Is there any place where a left-wing student can feel safer than a college campus, where conservatives are not just unwanted but cannot even speak?

169,COP,"Diamondback Energy (FANG), Concho Resources (CXO), Continental Resources (CLR) and other U.S. exploration and production companies will report earnings this week, likely providing more information on capital spending, production outlooks and oilfield service costs.Senior Robert W. Baird oil and gas analyst Daniel Katzenberg said he expects some increases in production outlooks for the year and said any increases in output without a corresponding bump in capital spending would be major a confidence boost for investors.Liquids production from U.S. shale plays is expected to expand by 2.3 million barrels per day by 2022 at current prices, and could grow more if prices rise further, according to a new report from the International Energy Agency.The number of oil rigs in operation has swelled for 15 straight weeks, according to Baker Hughes data, suggesting continued U.S. production gains in the near future.Even oil majors like Chevron (CVX) and Exxon Mobil (CVX) have turned their investment focus to expanding their holdings in the Permian Basin while curtailing spending in other areas.But the IEA worries that U.S. production won't be enough to offset the decline in investment in conventional drilling as demand for crude grows.But questions remain about service costs. Katzenberg doesn't think cost inflation will be an issue for E&Ps until WTI crude hits $60 per barrel.He said the average estimate is for a 20% increase this year, but he's only forecasting a 10% increase as improvements in drilling will offset some of the cost increases.IBD'S TAKE: Q1 reports from U.S. E&P companies will shed some light on how innovative producers have become vs. how much they relied on discounts given by service providers during the crude price bust.""However, given investor trepidation, updated cost commentary, and its impact on 2017 plans, remains the biggest risk to the group over the earnings period, in our opinion,"" Katzenberg  wrote in note dated April 20.Diamondback Energy, Devon Energy (DVN) and ConocoPhillips (COP) are scheduled to release first-quarter results Tuesday.

170,COP,"Election 2016: It took a lot of numbers-crunching, but Democratic Party pooh-bahs say they now know why Hillary Clinton lost: Many of the ""base"" voters she counted on in Blue States didn't show up, and switched to Donald Trump instead. It took them nearly six months to figure out the blindingly obvious, but it still doesn't get at the truth.The findings of a poll and focus groups conducted by Priorities USA for the Democratic Party advisory firm Global Strategy Group were devastating not just for Hillary Clinton, but for Democrats as a whole: It found that many former supporters of President Obama flipped and voted for Donald Trump instead of Hillary Clinton.For Democrats, it should be disquieting that the findings completely contradict their own carefully-managed self-image as champions of the underdog: Some 50% of those who voted for Obama and then defected to Trump said their incomes are lagging behind the cost of living, while another 31% said they were just treading water, the Washington Post's The Plum Line blog noted.Most devastating of all, 42% of these former Obama voters who moved over to vote GOP said congressional Democrats' economic policies favor the rich. That compares with 21% who said the same thing about Trump.In short, to many Americans now living through economic tough times, the Democrats have become the party of the rich and the connected. Some 77% in the poll said that Trump's policies would help all classes of Americans, vs. just 58% for congressional Democrats.Even so, that leaves out one key point that appeared nowhere in the Democratic Party analysis that we saw — that is, the Democratic Party has veered sharply leftward in recent years. They easily capture the bright Blue population centers on both coasts, but increasingly have trouble capturing the middle, both geographically and metaphorically.As a mid-2015 Gallup Poll noted, 47% of Democrats identified as ""social liberal and economic moderate/liberal."" That compares with just 39% identifying that way in 2008, and just 30% in 2001. Centrists in the party have been marginalized.As 2016 Democratic presidential candidate James Webb, himself a centrist, complained in early February, the party has shifted ""very far to the left"" in recent years due to its ""focus on identity politics."" This, he said, has diminished a ""key part of their base.""Even Chris Matthews, the liberal MSNBC host and former aide to liberal icon Tip O'Neill, admitted last weekend on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" that the party had shifted too far left in recent years. ""A lot of it's cultural, not just economics,"" he said.As we point out in a separate editorial today, the Democrats seem to have developed a ""tolerance"" problem. As in, Democrats can't tolerate any disagreement whatsoever.This has led to major losses for the Democrats in recent years. During President Obama's two terms, Democrats lost 9 U.S. Senate seats, 62 House seats, 12 governorships and a shocking 958 state legislative seats.Far from the base leaving the party, as the Priorities USA poll suggests, the party is leaving the base.That can be seen in those the party pushes forward as its leaders and ""stars,"" including socialist Bernie Sanders, far-left former professor Elizabeth Warren, and Democratic National Committee Chairman Thomas Perez, another far-lefty who has all but declared war on the Democratic Party's centrist and conservative wings.Here's where Hillary Clinton comes in: 30% of those queried in the poll said they voted against Clinton, rather than voted for Trump. What she was selling, even some Democrats didn't want to buy.So maybe they were being kind, or perhaps they just fear Hillary, but the party's insiders now saying Hillary's ""base"" didn't show up sounds like a cop-out. Yes, the Democratic Party has big problems. But as the saying goes, a fish rots from the head down. Rather than run as a centrist alternative to Bernie Sanders, Hillary Clinton's me-too leftism left many centrist Democrats cold.When Hillary emerged from semi-seclusion in early April to discuss her epic defeat, she blamed a number of things for her loss: The FBI reopening its investigation into her emails; WikiLeaks issuing stolen emails; something she called the ""weaponization of information""; the media; sexism and ""misogyny."" It was a long list.But, as the Washington Examiner has pointed out, she named — and blamed — everything except herself.The Democrats chose someone as the standard-bearer of their party who had a very low likability quotient with average voters to begin with. Pushed by the leftward drift of her own party, she adopted an equally far-left election platform of higher taxes, more regulation, and imposing a liberal cultural agenda across the nation.The result: She alienated key Democratic-base voters, and lost a race that many said was impossible for her to lose.Hillary Clinton was not ""most qualified person ever"" to run for the presidency, as some deluded Clinton supporters and the media propagandized. Her record at the State Department and with the various scandals — email server, Benghazi, pay-for-play — show how wrong that idea is.So maybe she should be congratulated: Given her sharp turn to the left last year and lack of genuine qualifications, it's surprising she did as well as she did.RELATED:Now We Know: It's Liberals Who Are Out-Of-Touch, Arrogant, Smug And IntolerantSorry, But Hillary Clinton Didn't Lost Because She Was A WomanAnother Hard-Left Turn Ends The Democratic Party As We Know ItWhy Hillary Clinton Lost: An Election Post-Mortem

In return, the Houston-based company will get $10.6 billion in cash and 208 million Cenovus shares valued at $2.7 billion. Conoco will also get contingent payments if Canadian crude prices hit certain levels.With the sale, the company will be able to reduce its debt to $20 billion, providing more leeway to return capital to shareholders.In January, Conoco raised its quarterly dividend 6% to 26.5 cents, after slashing it by 66% last year as it coped with the oil price bust.Shares jumped 6% in late trading on the stock market today, after closing up 1.3% at 45.95 in the regular session. Cenovus Energy fell 7% in late trading.For its buyback, Conoco will triple its planned 2017 repurchase to $3 billion from $1 billion, with the remaining $3 billion allocated to 2018 and 2019.""We laid out a bold and unique value proposition in late 2016 that was focused on free cash flow generation, a strong balance sheet, returning cash to shareholders, disciplined growth and improved returns,"" Chairman and CEO Ryan Lance said in a statement.""Our stated plan was to accelerate our value proposition by reducing debt with asset sales.

174,COP,"PHOENIX — Three months ago, State Trooper Jonathan Otto, 33, of the Arizona Department of Public Safety pulled over a car that had caught his attention by traveling 104 miles per hour long after midnight, just south of Kingman. He smelled marijuana in the car. It was driven by a man with an adult female wearing only lingerie. Their passenger was a female juvenile whose fake document showed her to be 18. She was, Otto says, ""not wearing a whole lot of clothing.""The adults had taken this 16-year-old from California to Arizona and were heading for Las Vegas. The girl gave Otto the California phone number of her grandmother, who immediately told him the girl might have been in prostitution since she was 15. Trained in interview techniques for such situations, and experienced at noticing people who somehow do not belong together, Otto correctly suspected DMST — domestic minor sex trafficking.Trooper Mitch Jergenson, 46, stopped a car driven by a man whose passenger was a 17-year-old girl he had gotten to know via Facebook and other social media. He had paid for her ticket from California to Phoenix and was taking her to Las Vegas. She said she was going to be a ""model,"" then said she was going to work in a strip club.

She had been a runaway for 17 months, since she was 13, and said that if she were returned to the custody of child services she would run again. After a 10-minute hearing, she was returned. She immediately ran, and did so repeatedly. To be in law enforcement is often to feel condemned to bailing an ocean with a thimble.Frank Milstead, too, knows how Sisyphus felt. When nature designed him, it had a director of the Department of Public Safety in mind. Large and laconic, he is the 54-year-old son of a Phoenix cop and, although he spent some time doing stand-up comedy, he knows in the marrow of his bones that ""there are so many people out there who want to take advantage of other people.""It is unclear how many victims of DMST there are because for many reasons the crime is not often reported by its victims. They are, Milstead says, usually abducted, sort of, from ""some environment where nobody missed them,"" adding, however, that traffickers cannot control ""people who are unwilling.""But many trafficked minors, ""who no one had made to feel valuable,"" are, Milstead says, ""chronic runaways"" with attenuated capacities for self-determination. They are products of poor or nonexistent parenting; their traffickers provide food, shelter, a simulacrum of caring, and drugs that produce dependency. Milstead guesses that 80% are addicted. Hence, they engage in ""survival sex.""Milstead's troopers patrol motel parking lots and get to know those who do the motels' housekeeping and notice suspicious activity. Big sporting events, of which Phoenix has many — the Super Bowl, the Final Four, NCAA championship football games — attract traffickers. Troopers also watch bars and nightclubs where minors are offered for sex, and, increasingly, monitor the internet and social media.The website Backpage, whose founders live in Arizona, began as a place for normal classified advertising but, a U.S. Senate investigation concluded, found its most lucrative business being a sexual marketplace. The New York Times reports that law enforcement officials say Backpage's ""dating section"" often ""used teasers like 'Amber Alert' and 'Lolita' to signal that children were for sale."" According to the Times, ""In the midst of a Senate investigation, a federal grand jury inquiry in Arizona, two federal lawsuits and criminal charges in California accusing Backpage's operators of pimping children, the website abruptly bowed to pressure in January and replaced its sex ads with the word 'Censored' in red.""Holding up his smartphone, Milstead, whose vocation reinforces his inclination to look on the dark side, says: ""Leaving your kid alone at night in his room with this? You might as well leave him or her in the city park downtown. Anything is available on a phone.""

179,COP,"Almost as soon as Pepsi (PEP) released its ""Jump In"" ad celebrating protest marches, protesters angrily complained that the ad was making light of protests — specifically Black Lives Matter protests — forcing Pepsi to pull the ad and apologize.Pundits immediately blamed the lack of racial diversity on Madison Ave., but it's more likely that the fiasco was the result of a lack of ideological diversity.In the 2-plus minute ad, model Kendall Jenner is in the middle of a photo shoot when a perfectly diverse group of marchers comes by carrying signs with peace symbols or messages like ""join the conversation,"" and dancing to a song with lyrics like ""We are the movement, this generation/You better know who we are, who we are.""At one point, Jenner is encouraged to join the march, and does so by dramatically pulling off her blonde wig and wiping off her lipstick, and somehow changing from a slinky dress into a T-shirt and stylish jeans, where she proceeds to hand a can of Pepsi to a cop, which elicits cheers from everyone. (You can see the ad for yourself on YouTube.)Pepsi issued a mea culpa after pulling the ad, saying it was just ""trying to project a global message of unity, peace and understanding"" — although the ad was clearly meant to pull at liberal heartstrings of those upset about a certain person being president.In a New York Times piece, advertising copywriter Nathaniel Friedman comments that ""One of the most frequent observations about 'Jump In' is that it rang so hollow that it's amazing no one involved in its creation anticipated this blowback. That's less surprising when you realize that minorities are underrepresented in advertising. For example, one report found that only 5.3% of managers and professionals at agencies in 2008 were black.""Of course, Neither Friedman nor anyone else making this observation knows the racial makeup of the people who put together and approved the Pepsi ad. But we'd bet there were more blacks involved than conservatives.Had there been even one nonliberal in the room, the ad probably never would have seen the light of day, because conservatives would have warned Pepsi that trying to overtly appeal to liberals — as this ad so clumsily does — almost always backfires, either infuriating liberals themselves or fueling endless calls for more appeasement.As the National Center for Public Policy Research's Justin Danhof once noted: ""Corporations that cave to the left only place a bigger target on their backs.""Some examples to show that Danhof has it right:In fact, a Fortune survey found that Wal-Mart is the company liberals say is the worst one for American and that they would most like to shut down.Making overt left-wing appeals not only tends to backfire with its target audience, it can easily antagonize those who aren't liberal. When Target (TGT) decided to change its bathroom policy to please the LGBT crowd, its sales tanked.After Kellogg (K) pulled its ads from Breitbart in November because it wasn't in line with the cereal maker's ""values,"" Breitbart mounted a boycott, which Kellogg said had no impact, although its stock price underperformed its main competitors for months after. Plus, weeks after pulling its ads, Amnesty International released a report saying that Kellogg, along with other food companies, had been getting palm oil from plantations ""where there are severe labor rights abuses,"" such as the use of child labor. Values, anyone?Corporate executives would do well to remember that — like tic-tac-toe and global thermonuclear war — the only way to win at the political appeasement game is not to play at all.RELATED:Corporate Execs Play Politics At Their Company's PerilWhy Are 'Progressives' Fighting Against Uber and Airbnb?Liberal Attacks On Restaurant Giants Punish Minority-Owned Franchises

181,COP,"PHOENIX — As a boy, Barry Goldwater Jr., son of the former senator and 1964 Republican presidential nominee, would step out of his father's house and shoot at tin cans 50 yards away. Now 78, he says he could fire in any direction and not endanger ""anything but a cactus."" His father, born in 1909 in Arizona territory, three years before statehood, built the house on a bluff where, as an adolescent, he rode his horse there and slept under the stars. There were about 30,000 people in Phoenix.The house is now in the nation's 12th-largest metropolitan area (about 4.6 million). Arizona's population, which was approximately 200,000 when the future senator was born and 750,000 when he was elected in 1952, is now approaching 7 million. Today's governor, Doug Ducey, is demonstrating the continuing pertinence of the limited-government conservatism with which Sen. Goldwater shaped the modern GOP, after himself being shaped by life in the leave-me-alone spirit of the wide open spaces of near-frontier Arizona.Last year, Ducey, 52, told National Review, ""If you want to learn something new, you need to read something old. As Barry Goldwater wrote in 'Conscience of a Conservative,' 'My aim is not to pass laws, it's to repeal them.'"" Ducey was preaching what he already had practiced.He took office in January 2015, as the Super Bowl was about to be played in suburban Glendale. The head of a state agency vowed that he was going to stage a sting to put Uber out of business, thereby benefiting Uber's taxi and limousine competitors. Ducey says he fired the man and abolished the agency.Ducey has sided with Airbnb against local governments restricting it in order to protect competitors, and has removed government-imposed limits (benefiting large beer brands) on the growth of microbreweries. He does not want Arizona to be part of ""the permission society.""This is the title of a new book by Timothy Sandefur, a litigator for the Goldwater Institute, a liberty-promoting think tank located 3.5 miles from the governor's office. Sandefur documents how far America has lapsed from the Founders' premise that our rights pre-exist government, which is instituted to protect them. Today, Americans' rights are increasingly restricted to those privileges that government grants for its purposes.Ducey recently demonstrated his understanding of this regarding the rogue barber. A Tucson cosmetology student, who himself was once homeless, disturbed the State Board of Cosmetology's serenity by giving — without possessing a barber's license — free haircuts to homeless people. Ducey asked the board to dismount from its high horse and recognize ""an act of charity that we should be celebrating."" About a third of Americans now need some form of government permission to do their chosen work, and Ducey wants Arizona to be an oasis of liberty in a society plagued by excessive occupational licensing.Born in Ohio, he came here to attend Arizona State University and became a businessman who attended Goldwater Institute events. After he joined the founder of Cold Stone Creamery ice cream shops and opened 1,400 nationwide, he was elected state treasurer, then governor. Seeking advice from the best, he called former Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels, who suggested appointing to his administration business people looking for new challenges. (Daniels asked, ""Do you know anyone who plays golf on Tuesdays and is miserable?"")Ducey wants Arizona to have a ""West Coast vibe with a Midwestern work ethic,"" and he cheekily calls California's Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown ""my partner in growing Arizona's economy"" because California's business climate is a powerful incentive for firms to relocate in Arizona, where more than 60% of its residents were born elsewhere. Arizona's motto is ""Ditat Deus"" (""God Enriches""), but His work can be facilitated by Ducey's goal of getting the state's income tax ""as close to zero as possible.""He calls himself a ""full-spectrum conservative,"" including support for free trade (NAFTA has been good for Arizona's commerce with Mexico), but there are limits to his Western libertarianism. Last year, he led the campaign that resulted in Arizona being the only one of five states voting on the issue to defeat legalization of recreational marijuana: ""I'm the son of a cop and the father of three teenage sons.""The current president has pointedly said, ""This is called the Republican Party. It's not called the Conservative Party."" Actually, it became a conservative party partly because of what an Arizonan did many decades ago. It may become such a party again, with another Arizonan's help.

183,COP,"XThe extension of a deal among OPEC and top non-OPEC countries to trim output isn't a foregone conclusion, Saudi Arabia reportedly warned top U.S. shale firms this week, in a sign that the No. 1 crude exporter's strategy to lift prices may be backfiring in the face of surging U.S. producers.In a closed-door meeting with executives from Anadarko Petroleum (APC), ConocoPhillips (COP), Occidental Petroleum (OXY), Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD), EOG Resources (EOG) and Newfield Exploration (NFX) on Tuesday, top Saudi officials said U.S. producers should ""not automatically assume OPEC will extend the cuts"" and that OPEC ""would not take the hit for the rise in U.S. shale production,"" an executive at the meeting told Reuters on Thursday.U.S. crude futures fell 2% to settle at $49.28 a barrel, its lowest close since November, after tumbling more than 5% Wednesday. Brent futures fell 1.7% to $52.19.Late last year, OPEC and non-members like Russia agreed to trim output by a collective 1.8 million barrels a day for the first six months of this year. While crude prices surged leading up to and immediately after the deal was reached, they later stayed sideways as U.S. companies rushed to add drilling rigs and crank up production.With the deal's upside fizzling out, OPEC member Iraq had starting talking about an extension when the agreement expires in June. And on Tuesday, Saudi Energy Minister Khalid Al-Falih appeared to lay out an initial, albeit tough, negotiating position.He told IHS' CERAWeek energy conference attendees Tuesday that ""conformity by all"" will be a criterion for any extension of the production-cut pact and that his country ""will not bear the burden of free rides"" as Saudi Arabia takes the brunt of the production cuts.Anadarko shares rose 0.9% to 61.94 on the stock market today. Conoco shares were up 1.2%. Occidental edged up 0.7%. Pioneer Natural climbed 1.9%. EOG was up 0.9%. Newfield jumped 1.9%.IBD'S TAKE: U.S. shale producers have ramped up spending and rig counts as oil prices rise and OPEC curbs production. But a debate is raging over how innovative producers have become vs. how much they relied on discounts. Failure to extend the agreement could send oil prices even lower, as U.S. companies have vowed to unleash a flood of investment this year to pump more oil from low-cost formations like the Permian Basin.On Tuesday, the Energy Information Administration raised its 2017 U.S. crude output forecast to 9.2 million barrels per day from a prior outlook of 8.98 million and raised its 2018 outlook to 9.73 million from 9.53 million. Last week, U.S. output hit 9.09 million barrels, the highest in a year and a half.Saudi Arabia's warning to U.S. shale comes despite strong compliance with the terms of the current agreement.Last month, OPEC Secretary General Mohammad Barkindo said he wants compliance on the output deal to rise past 90% to nearly 100%.But the high number is a collective figure and was due in part to Saudi Arabia cutting its output by more than it was expected, offsetting weaker compliance elsewhere.During an interview with CNBC after his speech, Al-Falih said Russia's cuts in February weren't enough but that Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak assured him that March cuts will be better.OPEC's next meeting is scheduled for May 25, and on March 26 a committee formed to monitor compliance with the production deal will meet in Kuwait.RELATED:Does OPEC Have Anything Left In The Tank As U.S. Shale Looms?This Is When Shell Expects Global Peak Oil DemandDow's Exxon Mobil, Royal Dutch Shell Announce Energy Deals As Oil Undercuts $50

The small cap Russell dropped 0.6%. Volume in the stock market today was lower on the Nasdaq and higher on the NYSE, according to preliminary data.The higher volume on the NYSE may have been related to the energy sector.In the S&P 500,  Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) fell 3% in volume twice its normal pace.

185,COP,"Saudi Arabia said it raised its crude output last month, a week after officials with the world's top oil exporter warned U.S. shale executives last week not to automatically assume a deal to trim production would be extended. The news sent U.S. crude futures lower for a seventh straight session.Saudi Arabia said it raised its oil production to 10.011 million barrels per day in February, up 2.7% from January, but still under the 10.05 million-barrel target the country agreed to under a production-cut deal reached last year between OPEC and top non-OPEC countries.But the number conflicted with figures OPEC derived from other sources, showing Saudi production falling by 68,100 barrels a day to 9.8 million barrels per day.After rallying before the OPEC data were released, U.S. crude closed down 1.4% to $47.72 a barrel, their lowest levels since late November. But prices rallied a bit in late trading after the American Petroleum Institute reported a decline of 531,000 barrels in U.S. oil inventories last week, while analysts expected a surge of 3.5 million barrels.Dow Jones industrial average component Exxon Mobil (XOM) shares dipped 0.5% to 80.99 on the stock market today. Fellow Dow stock Chevron (CVX) was off 1.8% to 107.36, hitting a four-month low and testing its 200-day line. BP (BP) retreated 1.9%, while Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) slid 2%.The OPEC report comes as Saudi energy minister Khalid Al-Falih told attendees at IHS's CERAWeek energy conference in Houston last week that the output deal is ""so far so good,"" but his country ""will not bear the burden of free rides"" by others in the agreement.Saudi officials also had a closed-door meeting with executives from top shale producers including ConocoPhillips (COP), EOG Resources (EOG) and Occidental Petroleum (OXY) warning that the producers should not assume the cartel will extend the output cuts, according to a Reuters report.Meanwhile, as U.S. shale rebounds, the additional supply will weigh further on crude prices. OPEC raised its growth forecast for U.S. oil production, now seeing an increase this year of 340,000 barrels per day, up by 100,000 barrels from a prior outlook.The bearish signs for oil come as OPEC members start pushing to extend their six-month production deal for another six months.While Saudi Arabia's Al-Falih said it was too early to decide on extend the output cuts, Iraq has signaled it wants an extension. And Kuwait's oil minister said Monday his country wants to extend the OPEC output cuts as U.S. stockpiles rose more than the cartel was expecting, according to the state run news agency Kuna.Iran said Tuesday it would stick to its end of the production deal, if the rest of OPEC does as well.""If OPEC members stay committed to the agreement (on freezing output), Iran will produce 3.8 million BPD of oil in (the) second half of the current year,"" Bijan Namdar Zanganeh was quoted as saying by state news agency IRNA, Reuters reported.RELATED: Why Oil Prices May Come Under Even More Pressure Next Month

186,COP,"""I'd win."" That's how Hillary Clinton responded when asked at Wellesley College what she would do differently in her failed run for the presidency in 2016. She's deceiving herself.The Clinton candidacy suffered from many things, but nothing more so than a self-imposed feeling of invulnerability and inevitability. Just do a random search on YouTube if you don't believe it and watch how all the soi-disant experts yammered on and on about how Hillary couldn't lose, Trump was already finished, the election was over.And her appearances at the Democratic Convention in Philadelphia last summer, which IBD attended, seemed more like coronation events than an actual election battle.Of course, we know how that turned out. But now, in her talk at Wellesley, Hillary suggested not only that she would win if the election were rerun, a bit of wishful revisionism, but that her actual defeat might have been because of her gender — sexism.""You know you're going to be subject to unfair and besides-the-point criticism,"" she said about being the first woman nominated to be president by a major party, and broadly hinting that this is what brought her down.But, as investigative reporter Amber Athey at the Campus Reform website reported, two New York University professors tried to show just how bad the bias against Hillary was. They created an experiment to ""reveal bias by re-enacting the presidential debates with the candidates' genders reversed.""It was an intriguing and creative idea. What the two impeccably progressive professors expected to find, of course, was that if Hillary were a man, she would be embraced and loved; and that Trump, as a woman candidate, would be despised. Gender bias, proved.Boy, were they surprised.""The two NYU professors who designed the experiment were 'unsettled' to discover that audience members actually found Trump's style more endearing when it came from a woman,"" Athey wrote of the NYU ""Her Opponent"" project. ""One female audience member even remarked that she found the male version of Clinton 'very punchable' because he smiled so much.""Ouch! So much for the postelection notion of Hillary as a feminist victim of all those angry white men in the Midwest. What Democrats, and the Clinton camp, have trouble recognizing is she was simply an unpopular candidate with an unpopular message, beaten by an unpopular candidate with a more widely popular message.Lest you think this is making too much of just one little experiment, a new poll out by Suffolk University shows that Clinton has left a bad taste in the mouth of much of America.In July 2016, 53% of those polled held favorable views of Hillary Clinton, while just 42% rated her as ""unfavorable."" But in the poll's most recent sounding taken this month, Hillary Clinton's unfavorability rating had soared to 55%, while her favorability had plunged to 35%. Her favorability fell sharply among both Democrats and independents.Yet another study, this one from the Wesleyan Media Project, found that Hillary Clinton's campaign was, in the words of Heat Street, ""without a doubt one of the worst-run political operations in years.""The study itself didn't mince words, calling her campaign ""devoid of policy discussions in a way not seen in the previous four presidential elections.""The truth is, as the saying goes, Hillary's support last year was a mile wide and an inch deep. Nor did she lose because she was a woman; that's a cop out, a cheap bit of undeserved victimhood that no doubt makes her feel better about losing to the big bully Trump.No, in the end, she lost because voters across America found her profoundly unsympathetic and out of touch. Her proposed policies — doubling down on ObamaCare, increasing  Dodd-Frank financial regulation, higher taxes, more federal spending, attacks on coal country workers and industry through strict climate-change rules, not to mention nonstop gender, class, culture and race warfare — reeked of a continuation of the failed Obama years.Oh yes, and did we mention the lies then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton made about her illegal home-brew email server and about what happened at Benghazi, where four Americans were killed? Those didn't help a bit in Middle America.Contrary to what Hillary Clinton might believe, sexism had nothing to do with it — or at least, very little. Hubris and an overweening sense of entitlement did. Voters were tired after eight years of Obamaism, and didn't want a reprise. They wanted deep changes to Washington, D.C., and its corrupt, cozy culture.In short, they went looking for a wrecking ball that would knock the whole corrupt mess down. And they got him. His name is Trump.RELATED:Why Hillary Clinton Lost: An Election Post-MortemThe Clinton Foundation Is Dead, But Not The Case Against HillaryClinton Scandals: Let The Investigations ContinueLookout, Hillary!

188,COP,"At the heart of Donald Trump's foreign policy team lies a glaring contradiction. On the one hand, it is composed of men of experience, judgment and traditionalism. Meaning, they are all very much within the parameters of mainstream American internationalism as practiced since 1945. Practically every member of the team — the heads of State, Homeland Security, the CIA, and most especially Defense Secretary James Mattis and national security adviser H.R. McMaster — could fit in a Cabinet put together by, say, Hillary Clinton.The commander in chief, on the other hand, is quite the opposite — inexperienced, untraditional, unbounded. His pronouncements on everything from the ""one China"" policy to the two-state (Arab-Israeli) solution, from NATO obsolescence to the ravages of free trade, continue to confound and, as we say today, disrupt.The obvious question is: Can this arrangement possibly work? The answer thus far, surprisingly, is: perhaps.The sample size is tiny but take, for example, the German excursion. Trump dispatched his grown-ups — Vice President Pence, Defense Secretary Mattis, Secretary of Homeland Security John Kelly and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson — to various international confabs in Germany to reassure allies with the usual pieties about America's commitment to European security. They did drop a few hints to Trump's loud complaints about allied parasitism, in particular shirking their share of the defense burden.Within days, Germany announced a 20,000-man expansion of its military. Smaller European countries are likely to take note of the new setup. It's classic good-cop, bad-cop: The secretaries represent foreign policy continuity but their boss preaches America First. Message: Shape up.John Hannah of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies suggests that the push-pull effect might work on foes as well as friends. Last Saturday, China announced a cutoff of all coal imports from North Korea for the rest of 2017. Constituting more than one-third of all North Korean exports, this is a major blow to its economy.True, part of the reason could be Chinese ire at the brazen assassination of Kim Jong Un's half-brother, who had been under Chinese protection. Nonetheless, the boycott was declared just days after a provocative North Korean missile launch — and shortly into the term of a new American president who has shown that he can be erratic and quite disdainful of Chinese sensibilities.His wavering on the ""one China"" policy took Beijing by surprise. Trump also strongly denounced Chinese expansion in the South China Sea and conducted an ostentatious love-in with Japan's prime minister, something guaranteed to rankle the Chinese. Beijing's boycott of Pyongyang is many things, among them a nod to Washington.This suggests that the peculiar and discordant makeup of the U.S. national security team — traditionalist lieutenants, disruptive boss — might reproduce the old Nixonian ""Madman Theory."" That's when adversaries tread carefully because they suspect the U.S. president of being unpredictable, occasionally reckless and potentially crazy dangerous. Henry Kissinger, with Nixon's collaboration, tried more than once to exploit this perception to pressure adversaries.Trump's people have already shown a delicate touch in dealing with his bouts of loopiness. Trump has gone on for years about how we should have taken Iraq's oil for ourselves. Sunday in Baghdad, Mattis wryly backed off, telling his hosts that ""All of us in America have generally paid for our gas and oil all along, and I am sure we will continue to do so in the future.""Yet sometimes an off-center comment can have its uses. Take Trump's casual dismissal of a U.S. commitment to a two-state solution in the Middle East. The next day, U.S. policy was brought back in line by his own U.N. ambassador. But this diversion might prove salutary. It's a message to the Palestinians that their decades of rejectionism may not continue to pay off with an inexorable march toward statehood — that there may actually be a price to pay for making no concessions and simply waiting for the U.S. to deliver them a Palestinian state.To be sure, a two-track, two-policy, two-reality foreign policy is risky, unsettling and has the potential to go totally off the rails. This is not how you would draw it up in advance. It's unstable and confusing. But the experience of the first month suggests that, with prudence and luck, it can yield the occasional benefit — that the combination of radical rhetoric and conventional policy may induce better behavior both in friend and foe.Alas, there is also a worst-case scenario. It needs no elaboration. RELATED:Trump News & Tweets

189,COP,"BP (BP) turned a profit in the fourth quarter, reversing a year-earlier loss, but falling short of views. The energy giant expects to modestly increase capital spending, but says it needs a higher oil price for cash flow to cover spending and dividends.The U.K. oil and gas giant earned $540 million in the fourth quarter vs. a loss of $3.3 billion in Q4 2015, BP reported Tuesday. That was below various estimates. Earnings per U.S. ADR more than doubled to 13 cents, but missed the consensus by 2 cents.Adjusted profit for refining and other downstream operations fell 28% to $877 million. Upstream activities earned $400 million vs. a $728 million year-earlier loss as crude prices rebounded.Revenue rose to $51.01 billion vs. $49.17 billion a year earlier.BP made number of acquisitions in late 2016, beefing up its natural gas exposure. But it aims to cut assets worth $4.5 billion to $5.5 billion in 2017.Production fell 5.5% vs. a year earlier to 2.19 million barrels of oil equivalent per day. BP sees production rising in 2017.But the company says it needs Brent crude prices to average $60 a barrel to balance its books, up from $50-$55 previously.

193,COP,"Chevron (CVX) plans to ramp up exploration activity in shale, with spending plans in the Permian Basin potentially doubling to $3 billion, even as it further reduces its overall investment this year.The oil major has 10 rigs in the Permian and is adding a new one every eight weeks, as operating costs there are seen falling by 35% this year, management said on a conference call Friday.""I would expect an increase in unconventional spending,"" Chairman and CEO John Watson told analysts. ""We've talked about our ramping up in the Permian — talking about $2 billion there but we easily could spend another $1 billion there. Just in the shale and tight areas you would see some increase but that's short cycle.""In November, Chevron said it will spend $1.5 billion a year to develop its assets in the West Texas play.The focus on so-called unconventional plays like shale would mark a shift for one of the industry's integrated global energy giants, which poured billions of dollars into ambitious projects — offshore and onshore — in far-flung places around the world when oil prices were higher.On Friday, Watson said it ""wouldn't surprise me"" if unconventional activity accounted for a quarter of Chevron's production by the middle of next decade.But the company said to expect total capital spending to drop this year after capital and exploratory expenditures fell to $22.4 billion in 2016 from $34 billion in 2015.Chevron's muted view on overall spending comes despite the recovery in crude prices and contrasts with more aggressive investment plans from U.S. shale companies for this year.""We are well positioned to improve earnings and be cash flow balanced in 2017 through continued tight spending and cost control and additional revenue from expected production growth,"" Watson said in a statement earlier.Meanwhile, Chevron reported it swung to a Q4 profit of 22 cents a share from a year-ago loss of 31 cents a share, as revenue grew 7.7% to $31.5 billion. Thomson Reuters reported adjusted EPS of 21 cents, well below analysts' forecasts for EPS of 64 cents on revenue of $33.3 billion.Upstream operations swung to a profit of $930 million from a year-ago loss of $1.36 billion. Worldwide net oil-equivalent production was 2.67 million barrels per day, basically flat from a year ago.

Even before boosts activity there, the company got a lift in Q4.""Production increases from base business in the Gulf of Mexico and shale and tight properties in the Permian Basin in Texas and New Mexico were more than offset by the impact of asset sales of 58,000 barrels per day and normal field declines,"" Chevron said.Last week, Exxon announced that it would acquire 275,000 acres in the Permian Basin in a $6.6 billion deal with to acquire several small private companies.RELATED: U.S. Crude Output Hits 9-Month High; BP, Others Near Buy PointsHalliburton: Service Prices To Rise More Than Oil Producers ExpectSchlumberger Says It Needs To Charge 'Significantly Higher' Prices

197,COP,"Federal Reserve policymakers spent much of the past year bemoaning the slow pace of U.S. economic growth and worrying that it had become a chronic condition.But this year, the Fed will shift to the role of traffic cop, keeping its eyes on the radar gun out of concern that the economy will blow past its speed limit, boosted by President-elect Donald Trump's fiscal fuel.Stock investors are loving the sudden shift to more dynamic growth, with financial stocks like JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS) lifted by a steeper yield curve and steel stocks like Nucor (NUE) surging on prospects for an infrastructure-spending binge.Yet if Trump hits the gas in a low-speed zone, some economists have warned, the Fed might see little choice but to advance its timetable for hiking rates, the equivalent of issuing speeding tickets to slow down traffic. The positive scenario is one in which Trump's policies don't simply hit the fiscal accelerator but actually raise the speed limit, allowing the economy to grow faster without pushing inflation much above the Fed's comfort zone.While there's a pretty big disagreement among economists over which scenario is more likely, Wall Street doesn't have to worry too much about who's right at the moment. Yet the debate will take center stage starting in the second half of 2017 when Trump's fiscal policies are expected to begin ramping up.IBD'S TAKE: IBD recently examined a host of ways Wal-Mart is working to streamline its business, from using drones to manage inventories to its new ""Scan & Go"" app. For a closer look, read ""How Wal-Mart May Revive U.S. Productivity — And Its Own Fortunes.""The internal Fed debate will feature a board with two new appointments by Trump, filling slots that remain vacant because the Republican-led Senate blocked President Obama's nominees. While some expect that Trump appointees will be in the sound-money GOP mold, balancing out Obama's dovish appointees, there may be good reason not to expect them to shift policy in a hawkish direction. Trump's picks may be especially open to the possibility that his policies of deregulation and corporate tax cuts can help revive productivity growth, effectively raising the economy's speed limit. And by the end of the year, Trump likely will nominate his choice for Federal Reserve chairman, as Janet Yellen's term as Fed chief ends in February 2018.The key concern is that the U.S. economy may already be approaching full employment, meaning that wage and inflation pressures will intensify if the unemployment rate falls further.As Yellen put it in her post-meeting press conference on Dec. 14, ""I would say at this point that fiscal policy is not obviously needed to provide stimulus to help us get back to full employment.""To be sure, Trump's planned fiscal boost, eight years into the economic recovery and just as the deficit has renewed a worrisome and potentially long-term rise, has a meaningful risk that it could backfire.Yet in other respects, the timing of Trump's agenda for cutting corporate tax rates and spending more on infrastructure looks pretty good.One issue is that labor force participation remains depressed, especially among men of prime working age, 25-54. Meanwhile, the ranks of workers unable to find full-time work remain elevated and those working part-time by choice have soared by more than 2 million since the end of 2013. If Trump's policies can bring workers off the sidelines and turn part-timers into full-timers, the economy may be able to grow somewhat faster without an upsurge in wage growth and inflation.In fact, Obama's economic advisors have pushed an infrastructure spending boost as one way to increase labor force participation. Replacing ObamaCare also could make a difference, since that may have contributed to the elevated level of part-time work, both involuntary and by choice. One factor is the ObamaCare mandate requiring employers to offer coverage to workers clocking at least 30 hours per week. ObamaCare rules also encourage less work with big subsidy cliffs for those earning above certain income thresholds, especially 200% of the poverty level and 400% of poverty. Further, workers who don't have an offer of employer coverage, either because they're part-time or work at a smaller firm, may get much bigger health insurance subsidies than those who do.Yet, the construction sector is among those complaining the loudest about a lack of qualified workers, and Trump's still-unclear immigration policies could work against rising participation.Another possible effect of Trump's agenda could be a rebound in productivity growth, meaning employers wouldn't have to increase hiring as much to facilitate faster growth.Fed Vice Chair Stanley Fischer noted in an October speech that a broad measure of business-sector productivity growth has risen only 0.5% a year over the past five years vs. 1.25% over the past decade and 2% a year, on average, from 1976 to 2005.Slow productivity growth largely explains why Fed members' economic projections marked the long-run growth rate of the economy down to 1.8% in September from 2.0% in June, which was itself down from the 2.2% to 2.3% range seen in early 2014.At her latest press conference, Yellen said that improved productivity growth could come from ""policies that spur either private or public investment to enhance the quality of capital in the United States that workers have to work with; and policies that spur innovation or competition or the formation of new firms.""""So tax policies can have that effect,"" she added.Yet it's possible that Trump's agenda could increase labor force participation and improve productivity growth, but not enough to keep a tight labor market from overheating. In that case, interest rates would rise faster than expected, making borrowing more expensive, hurting the housing market and counteracting much of the hoped-for gains.""Perhaps the biggest risk next year is that the animal spirits unleashed by Trump's proposed policies, and then the implementation of his most stimulative policies, overheat the economy,"" wrote Ed Yardeni, chief investment strategist at Yardeni Research.But he sees the ""most likely scenario"" as much more favorable, with technological innovation yielding productivity gains, a strengthening dollar helping to keep a lid on inflation, and deregulation acting as ""a powerful force of disinflation, as it has been in the past.""In this scenario, Yardeni sees the 10-year Treasury yield remaining under 3% next year as the S&P 500 rises to 2400-2500, as corporate and individual tax cuts boost earnings.RELATED:Top 10 Trends To Watch For 2017: From Trump To Apple's iPhone 8ISM Manufacturing Index Hits 2-Year High In December

198,COP,"At one point in President Obama's interview with ABC News that aired over the weekend, George Stephanopoulos noted that ""the Democratic Party got pretty hollowed out on your watch, about 1,000 seats lost in the Congress, Senate, governors, state houses."" Then he asked: ""Is that on you?""It was a good question. Since Obama took office, Democrats' fortunes have plummeted. The party lost 900 seats in state legislatures, 12 governorships, 69 House seats and 13 Senate seats.Clearly, whatever leadership Obama provided, it wasn't helping Democrats connect with voters across the country.So what was Obama's response?At first, he tried — and we're not making this up — to blame President Bush.""I came in the middle of worst financial crisis since the Great Depression,"" he said. And since ""in 2010 there were a lot of folks who were still out of work,"" whoever was president was ""gonna get hit.""That's a lot of historical revisionism right there. The 2010 election was largely a repudiation of ObamaCare, which Obama had signed into law in early 2010 despite fierce public opposition, and the view that he and Democrats in Congress had taken their eye off the ball on the economy to push ObamaCare.Plus, his massively expensive ""stimulus"" wasn't producing any of the benefits he'd promised. (Anyone remember ""Recovery Summer"" in 2010?)But even Obama couldn't bring himself to blame the Great Recession for the Democrats' losses at every level of government since 2010.Instead, Obama said — and again, we are not making this up — that he was just too darn busy being president to help his fellow Democrats.""My docket was really full here,"" Obama said, ""so I can't be both chief organizer of the Democratic Party and function as commander in chief and president of the United States.""Stephanopoulos was either too polite or too partisan to not laugh out loud at this statement.This is a president, after all, who despite a supposedly full docket managed to squeeze in more than 300 rounds of golf, take 217 days of vacation, and attend more than 450 fundraisers, which was more than twice as many fundraisers as Ronald Reagan attended during his two terms in office. Obama's light schedule prompted critics to refer to him as our semiretired president.Even the Benghazi attack and the murder of a U.S. ambassador wasn't ""commander in chiefy"" enough to stop Obama from jetting off to Las Vegas the very next day, while skipping an intelligence briefing (one of many he blew off) to hit a fundraiser.Also, by the way, the Democrats' loss of the Senate in 2014 wasn't because poor Obama was stuck in the White House. In fact, they generally didn't want him out on the campaign trail in battleground states for fear that it would hurt their chances.Oh, and Obama broke tradition by actively, fervently campaigning for his successor, telling voters that his entire legacy was on the line.What Obama refuses to admit is that it was his failed policies, and his party's sharp turn to the left, that alienated voters across the country and prompted them to hand the reins of government to Republicans.These weren't the only keen insights offered up by Obama in his umpteenth exit interview. Some others:After all, he made a point of it saying it to Stephanopoulos ... twice.""Everybody likes to talk about how cool I was,"" he said at the start of the interview, referring to his White House senior staff.Then he expanded it at the end of the interview. ""People,"" he said, referring to everyone, ""always talk about how cool I am.""And here we thought people talked about things like making ends meet, keeping their families safe, getting a good education, terrorism and other mundane topics.""The American people are,"" he said, ""anxious for change.""Still? Wasn't that what he was supposed to deliver? His entire first campaign was built on ""hope and change.""He also admitted that he wasn't the transformative president — like Reagan — that he'd hoped to be. Instead, all he could say what that he'd energized a ""new generation"" of activists, who ""came out to vote for me"" but who weren't energized enough to vote for anyone else.Stephanopoulos asked Obama about the fact that ""most African Americans think we've gone backwards on race relations.""Obama's answer is that — thanks to riots, protests, cop shootings and the rest — ""we have greater awareness of where we're falling short than we used to.""In the context of Russia's alleged meddling in the U.S. election, Stephanopoulos asked Obama point blank: ""Did you underestimate Vladimir Putin?""Obama's answer was: ""I don't think I underestimated him.""Then he went on to say that ""What is true is that the Russians intended to meddle, and they meddled."" In other words, Obama underestimated Putin's desire and ability to meddle in the election.After eight years, Obama's ability to believe anything that comes out his own mouth appears undiminished.RELATED:Obama Is Still Living In His BubbleObama Leaves A Terrible Legacy To His SuccessorOn His Way Out, Obama Makes Another Promise He's Sure To Break

199,COP,"President-elect Donald Trump told Hillary Clinton during their second debate that she'd ""be in jail"" if he was in charge of the law. He's not in charge of the law, nor will he be, and if Clinton is convicted she'd go to prison, not jail, a subtlety lost on most anyone who hasn't been a cop reporter.But his overall point was not lost.At that October debate, he said if elected he would ""instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation,"" which centered around Clinton's private email account handled by a nonsecure server in her Chappaqua home — likely an attempt to evade freedom of information laws — and the way she used her position as secretary of state to enrich her family's Clinton Foundation.It would be within his authority to do that. Indeed, it would be his duty.Unfortunately, Trump said a couple of weeks after his election that he was not inclined to appoint a special prosecutor as Clinton ""went through a lot and suffered greatly in many different ways."" While some would say he was showing mercy, it's a decision he might one day regret.Keeping his campaign word could possibly save New York City — his city — from yet another mayor who would prolong the Sandinista ruin being overseen by its current mayor.Like so many others whose lifelong goal is to run other people's lives, Clinton apparently isn't done meddling. She has been mentioned as a possible candidate for mayor of New York City. Maybe even the next mayor. John Gizzi of Newsmax says that a former elected New York City Democrat has admitted that ""she's talking about it.""New York City just might have to do if she can't run the country and satisfy her all-consuming thirst for power on a national scale. It would be too hard for someone whose life is driven by the urge to invade and control the private affairs of others to stay out of ""public service"" for too long.Media reports indicate Clinton is being recruited by the party to challenge Democratic Mayor Bill de Blasio in the election later this year, because the Revolutionary Mayor's performance has caused some dissatisfaction inside the Democratic Machine.His administration has been under state and federal investigations, the New York Post reports, and the headaches caused by panhandlers, potholes, vagrancy, vandalism, and gridlocked traffic are apparently more painful than when de Blasio took office.Given that de Blasio was Clinton's campaign manager when she first ran for the Senate in 2000, she might not want to run against him.But the Clintons are loyal only to themselves and the predatorily ambitious Hillary might be happy to leave boot marks on de Blasio's political carcass to get another crack at ruling a village.New York City just might have to do if she can't run the country and satisfy her all-consuming thirst for power on a national scale. It would be too hard for someone whose life is driven by the urge to invade and control the private affairs of others to stay out of ""public service"" for too long. While Clinton would be a better mayor than de Blasio, the improvement could be measured in single-digit micrometers. Yes, de Blasio has the radical's background and the Marxist sympathies to match. But Clinton is no liberator. She would bring her own left-wing toxins with her into office. The city's path to a full-on socialist welfare would continue uninterrupted.Trump could save the city — and the foolish, impulsive New Yorkers who would put her office, as she is wildly popular there, says Gizzi — from a future much like its crumbling present.At the same time, he'd make sure that justice caught up to the Clintons. It would be late, but that's, as the saying goes, better than never.RELATED:Clinton Scandals: Let The Investigations ContinueHillary Clinton Email Scandal ExplainedIs The Clinton Foundation Doomed?Clinton Foundation Scandal

201,COP,"The U.S. economy added 156,000 jobs in December as the unemployment rate ticked up to 4.7%, the Labor Department reported on Friday.The consensus of Wall Street forecasters was for a 175,000 payroll gain and a 4.7% jobless rate.November payrolls were revised higher and October jobs lower, reflecting a net increase of 19,000. The jobless rate rose as more people entered the labor force.Average hourly earnings rose 0.4% from November and 2.9% from a year ago, the best annual growth since 2009. That followed a reported 0.1% fall in hourly wages in last month's report.After the report, stock futures climbed into positive territory. The 10-year Treasury yield rebounded to 2.40%, recovering much of the steep drop seen on Thursday, amid a mixed picture of faster wage growth but slightly higher unemployment. The dollar also bounced back from a bout of selling.The faster pace of wage gains in December reported by the Labor Department jibes with what companies have been saying:On a Dec. 6 earnings call, Dave & Buster's Entertainment (PLAY) said it expected wage inflation of about 5% in the fourth quarter, up from its September projection of 4% to 4.5% for the second half of 2016.Casey's General Stores (CASY) highlighted ""increased wage pressures"" on a Dec. 8 earnings call as the prime factor behind a 4.9% increase in same-store operating costs.""Labor is under some pressure,"" Darden Restaurants (DRI) CEO Gene Lee said on a Dec. 20 earnings call, when asked about the company's guidance for modestly higher labor inflation. ""We're operating in a low unemployment situation and in that environment we're going to continue to see wage increases.""The retail sector added 6,300 jobs in December, ahead of a wave of post-holiday store closings and layoffs announced by Macy's (M) and Sears (SHLD), which are being hurt by competition from Amazon (AMZN) and low mall traffic. Macy's will cut 10,000 jobs as it named the 68 stores it will shut down soon, part of a plan to shutter 100 stores. Sears will close 150 Sears and Kmart locations.IBD'S TAKE: The Federal Reserve, long worried about paltry growth, has shifted to the role of traffic cop. Now the key question is whether Donald Trump's fiscal fuel will raise the economy's speed limit, allowing for faster growth without pushing inflation much above the Fed's comfort zone.The health care sector added 43,200 jobs; food service and drinking places 29,600; manufacturers 17,000; financial firms 13,000; and government 12,000. Most of the factory job gains came in durable goods manufacturing, where a 15,000 rise was the biggest in two years.The reported rise in the unemployment rate comes after minutes of the Federal Reserve's December 14 meetings showed that most policymakers see the labor market as being close to achieving the central bank's maximum-employment objective. A few policy committee members expressed concern that the jobless rate could substantially undershoot the target, leading to a buildup of inflationary pressures.The details of the household survey, which is used to derive the unemployment rate, showed that the number of people working part-time by choice jumped 192,000 on a seasonally adjusted basis to a record 21.3 million.The wage levels in the December report incorporate changes made by companies in preparation for the Obama administration's overtime rule that was slated to take effect Dec. 1 before a federal judge granted an 11th-hour injunction to states and business groups that filed suit.Casey's management said they would stick by a planned annual salary increase of $10 million to avoid overtime pay. While it would be hard for any company to retract commitments for pay hikes once announced, Chief Financial Officer Bill Walljasper said the decision is in keeping with Casey's goal ""to be the employer of choice in our market area, and so part of that for us is to have competitive wages at competitive benefits.""Wal-Mart (WMT) boosted minimum salaries for assistant store managers to $48,500 from $45,000, effective in September, to avoid being liable for overtime pay, which would be required for employees earning below $47,476 under the rule. The current salary threshold below which companies have to pay overtime is $23,660.Wal-Mart has raised base pay to attract and retain better staff, improving customer service and productivity.RELATED:Amazon Wins Christmas, And Its 50-Day, As Macy's, Malls MauledHow Overtime Pay Ruling Affects Wal-Mart, Dollar Tree, Fast Food

202,COP,"The market rally in the weeks after the election of Donald Trump is being buffeted by volatility, uncertainty and global crosscurrents — trends that are now playing out in the gold market.Prices, which had been going nowhere but down, surged 1.5% on Thursday, part of a rally since Dec. 27 that has erased more than one third of the metal's 14% postelection plunge.Shares of Newmont Mining (NEM) and Barrick Gold (ABX), big losers in the weeks after Trump's win, were up 4.8% and 6.3%, respectively, in late-afternoon trading on the stock market today, hitting levels not seen since before voters went to the polls.Treasury yields had been a one-way bet higher, with the 10-year yield rising 100 basis points to 2.62% Dec. 16 from 1.62% Nov. 8. Yet despite solid economic readings and the Federal Reserve's surprise signal that there might be three rate hikes in 2017, the 10-year yield's slide took it all the way down to 2.37% on Thursday.Higher interest rates and a stronger U.S. dollar have been talked up by various macroeconomic strategists as near sure things in 2017, but the dollar's rise also has suddenly hit resistance. The U.S. dollar index slid 1% vs. a basket of other advanced economy currencies on Thursday and has now given up more than one-third of its postelection rise.So why is the Trump rally suddenly facing turbulence?Thursday's moves appeared to be at least partly tied to a sudden reversal of China's currency, which had been a one-way bet lower vs. the dollar. Market players speculated that the People's Bank of China may have intervened to prop up the sagging currency in an effort to stem capital outflows.The Chinese government has been instituting capital controls, which has fueled a surge in prices of  bitcoin, as the digital currency can be sold on bitcoin exchanges outside of China. Bitcoin prices in China plunged more than 20% overnight as the yuan suddenly reversed higher, potentially a sign that the crackdown on capital leaving the country could intensify.IBD'S TAKE: The Federal Reserve, long worried about paltry growth, has shifted to the role of traffic cop. Now the key question is whether Donald Trump's fiscal fuel will raise the economy's speed limit, allowing for faster growth without pushing inflation much above the Fed's comfort zone.The market action in China is a reminder that if the U.S. is winning all the time, as Trump intends, the global economic backdrop could deliver some surprises from the countries that are losing. On Thursday, Mexico's central bank intervened to prop up the sagging peso, which has been battered by concern over Trump's policies.Ford (F) said on Tuesday that it's canceling plans for a new car factory in Mexico. On Thursday, Trump tweeted a warning to Toyota (TM) that it will pay ""a big border tax"" if it builds a plant in Mexico to ship Corollas to the U.S., echoing a threat aimed at General Motors (GM) days earlier.The volatility in interest rates, the dollar and gold also reflect uncertainty about the economic and political outlook. The Trump rally has been built on big expectations set by the president-elect and encouraged by his party's control of Congress.Those expectations haven't been dashed, by any means. Investors are still expecting big corporate tax cuts to lift earnings growth as well as infrastructure spending and individual tax cuts to boost the economy.But there may be a creeping sense of uncertainty about just how much Trump can get done, how fast it will happen, and whether some of his moves may backfire.RELATED:Ford Cancels Mexico Plant; Trump Threatens GM With 'Big Border Tax'

203,COP,"The employment report out on Friday at 8:30 a.m. ET is expected to show that the economy added 175,000 jobs in December, continuing the solid trend of recent months.But the real focus will be on wage growth and the jobless rate, which both delivered big surprises in last month's report.After the rise in average hourly earnings hit a seven-year high of 2.8% in October, wages backslid in November, slipping 0.1% and bringing the annual rate down to 2.5%. Friday's report could indicate whether that was just a statistical quirk.The consensus view is that December's report will show a 0.3% rise in average hourly earnings from November. Jefferies economists Ward McCarthy and Thomas Simons expect a 0.4% jump, lifting annual wage gains to a new cycle high of 2.9%.In November, the jobless rate surprisingly fell to a nine-year low of 4.6% from 4.9% amid a drop in workforce participation. The volatile household survey had been showing that more workers had been coming off the sidelines to participate in a stronger job market. Economists expect Friday's report to show the jobless rate rising to 4.7%, indicating that November's report somewhat overstated how tight the labor market is.Wage gains and the unemployment rate are both key indicators for the real question on everyone's mind: Can the job market accommodate President-elect Donald Trump's fiscal fuel without overheating? That won't be clear for some time and depends greatly on the size of the fiscal package that comes out of Congress, but Friday's report will offer some clues and could affect expectations for how fast the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates in the coming year.IBD'S TAKE: The Federal Reserve, long worried about paltry growth, has shifted to the role of traffic cop. Now the key question is whether Donald Trump's fiscal fuel will raise the economy's speed limit, allowing for faster growth without pushing inflation much above the Fed's comfort zone.On Thursday, ADP reported that private employers added 153,000 jobs in December, somewhat less than expected. The ADP has an uneven record of predicting Labor's nonfarm payrolls. Meanwhile, initial jobless claims tumbled by 28,000 to 235,000 in the week ended Dec. 260,000.Incoming evidence from corporate earnings reports suggests that wage pressures are continuing to rise moderately.On a Dec. 6 earnings call, Dave & Buster's Entertainment (PLAY) said it expected wage inflation of about 5% in the fourth quarter, up from its September projection of 4% to 4.5% for the second half of 2016.Casey's General Stores (CASY) highlighted ""increased wage pressures"" on a Dec. 8 earnings call as the prime factor behind a 4.9% increase in same-store operating costs.Casey's management also said they would stick by a planned annual salary increase of $10 million to avoid overtime pay under the Obama administration's Labor Department rule that was to take effect on Dec. 1., even though the election and an eleventh-hour injunction mean it's unlikely to be implemented without major changes.While it would be hard for any company to retract commitments for pay hikes once announced, Chief Financial Officer Bill Walljasper said the decision is in keeping with Casey's goal ""to be the employer of choice in our market area, and so part of that for us is to have competitive wages at competitive benefits.""Wal-Mart (WMT) boosted minimum salaries for assistant store managers to $48,500 from $45,000, effective in September, to avoid being liable for overtime pay.""Labor is under some pressure,"" Darden Restaurants (DRI) CEO Gene Lee said on a Dec. 20 earnings call, when asked about the company's guidance for modestly higher labor inflation.""We're operating in a low unemployment situation and in that environment we're going to continue to see wage increases,"" Lee said, according to a Seeking Alpha transcript. But he added that such environments have been ""great for our business"" in the past, and he's optimistic that ""this wage inflation that we're seeing is going to turn into discretionary income and some of it's going to end up back in our restaurants.""RELATED:Jobless Rate Dives To 9-Year Low; Is Labor Market Too Tight?How Overtime Pay Ruling Affects Wal-Mart, Dollar Tree, Fast Food
"
204,COP,"Federal Reserve officials focused on the impact of potential fiscal stimulus during their December policy meeting, with many starting to worry that the central bank might eventually be forced to quicken the pace of interest-rate increases to head off higher inflation.Almost all the participants ""indicated that the upside risks to their forecasts for economic growth had increased as a result of prospects for more expansionary fiscal policies in coming years,"" read the minutes of the Dec. 13-14 meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, released Wednesday in Washington.Despite growing attention to the risks of fiscal policy spurring faster growth than currently forecast, most on the committee reiterated that a ""gradual"" pace of rate hikes over the coming years would likely remain appropriate.The minutes of the session, at which officials raised their benchmark lending rate by a quarter percentage point, showed that uncertainties over future fiscal policies weighed heavily in their discussion of the economy and the future path of monetary policy.IBD'S TAKE: The Federal Reserve will likely play traffic cop to Trump in 2017 as he hits the fiscal accelerator.President-elect Donald Trump promised higher spending on infrastructure, tax cuts and regulatory reform during his campaign, but has offered few new details of his policy goals since winning the Nov. 8 election. His inauguration is set for Jan. 20.""Participants emphasized their considerable uncertainty about the timing, size and composition of any future fiscal and other economic policy initiatives as well as about how those policies might affect aggregate demand and supply,"" the minutes said.The committee was divided on how far unemployment was likely to fall, and over the consequences for inflation if it fell significantly below the Fed's goal.""Many participants"" judged the risks of a sizeable undershoot on unemployment had increased somewhat, according to the minutes. Still, ""most participants"" expected the jobless rate would fall only ""modestly below their estimates of the longer-run normal rate.""The minutes showed that ""about half"" of the committee members had begun to incorporate assumptions about expansionary fiscal policy into their forecasts.Among officials still emphasizing the downside risks to the economy, some mentioned repeatedly the headwind created by an appreciating dollar.The U.S. currency has surged since the election, partly in anticipation of fiscal policies under the incoming Trump administration. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index, which measures the greenback against 10 global currencies, had appreciated 5.2% between Nov. 8 and the end of FOMC's meeting on Dec. 14. Since then it has strengthened an additional 0.9%.A stronger dollar hurts growth by making U.S. exports less competitive and slows inflation by making imports cheaper.At their December meeting, officials raised the number of quarter-point rate hikes they foresee in 2017, to three from two, while signaling growing confidence in the economy, according to their median estimate.Unemployment declined to 4.6% in November, its lowest level in more than nine years and close to most economists' estimates for the its lowest sustainable level. The Fed's preferred measure of price inflation was 1.6% in the 12 months through November after excluding food and energy components. Policy makers expect that to rise this year toward their 2% goal.The FOMC holds eight scheduled meetings a year, with the next session slated for Jan. 31-Feb. 1.
"
205,COP,"Mortgage applications tumbled 12% in the last two weeks of the year, but demand for buying a home fell much less, holding onto most of its postelection gains despite the recent rise in borrowing costs.Refinancing activity plunged 22%, seasonally adjusted, in the two weeks ended Dec. 30, the Mortgage Bankers Association said Wednesday, tumbling more than 50% in just four weeks.Mortgage rates, already climbing ahead of Election Day, soared following the election of Donald Trump. President-elect Trump has pledged tax cuts, regulatory reform and an infrastructure spending blitz that could boost economic growth and inflation, pushing Treasury yields higher.Demand for loans to buy a home dipped 2% over the last two weeks of 2016, and were off 1% vs. a year earlier. But purchase applications are still up nearly 16% since the week ended Nov. 11, which largely included pre-election responses.IBD'S TAKE: A key question for the housing industry in 2017 is how aggressive the Federal Reserve will be. Policymakers have signaled three rate hikes this year, but the Fed may play traffic cop as President Trump hits the gas.The average fixed-rate mortgage fell 6 basis points to 4.39% in the latest week, but is still up from 3.75% in the week ended Nov. 4. The prior week's 4.45% was the highest in two-and-a-half years.Many prospective buyers may be rushing to buy a home while rates are still historically low. But the rush may be fading as higher rates and still-rising home values take their toll on housing affordability, especially millennials.In addition to the recent dip in purchase applications, the Pending Home Sales Index unexpectedly fell to a 10-month low in November, the National Association of Realtors said last week.Other data, including new- and existing-home sales showed increases, with the latter hitting their best levels since before the housing bust. But those reports may not be as timely as the pending sales or the mortgage applications.On the upside for housing demand, job growth continues at a modest pace with indications that wage gains are starting to pick up.Shares of homebuilders, including KB Home (KBH), Toll Bros.

206,COP,"We're all playing a guessing game. During the campaign, Donald Trump made many promises. But whether friend or foe, we don't know what he will actually do. The result is a deluge of predictions from politicians, pundits, think tanks, lobbyists, economists and others. Here, for example, is the outlook of economists at Nomura Securities.Conceding enormous ""uncertainty,"" the economists predict that large tax cuts, costing $3 trillion in lost revenues over the next decade, will be the centerpiece of Trump's economic program. Coupled with the tax cuts would be $500 billion in added spending, mostly for infrastructure and defense. These amounts enlarge budget deficits, already estimated by the Congressional Budget Office to be $8.6 trillion over the decade.The Republican Congress is expected to repeal the Affordable Care Act (""Obamacare""), but the timing and the availability of a replacement are unknown and, possibly, unsettled. Similarly, the economists anticipate ""significant regulatory changes"" — cutbacks — and more deportations of illegal immigrants. Again, details are unknown and perhaps nonexistent. Trade policy is the same; there have been unconfirmed reports that Trump will slap a temporary 5% to 10% tariff on all imports.What's the effect on the economy? Less than you might expect, say the Nomura economists. The tax cuts and regulatory cutbacks are assumed to increase economic growth initially (beginning in late summer), but then contradictory forces erode the effect. Faster economic growth and fear of more inflation cause long-term interest rates to rise; slower immigration puts upward pressure on wages. The Federal Reserve, also fearful of inflation, tightens credit by raising short-term interest rates.""We expect the Fed will raise rates twice in 2017 and three times in 2018,"" say the economists. (In December, the Fed raised short-term interest rates to a range from 0.5% to 0.75%. If future increases were the same amount, then the Fed funds would reach 1.75% to 2% sometime in 2018. From late 2008 to December 2015, it had been close to zero.)Put all this together, and the economy's growth — according to Nomura's projections — doesn't change much. Bigger deficits spur growth; higher interest rates restrain it. Gross domestic product is expected to grow 1.9% in 2017 and 1.8% in 2018. Since 2010, GDP growth has been roughly 2% a year.The Nomura economists are skeptical of the claim, made by some Trump nominees, that lower taxes and fewer regulations can raise annual economic growth to a range of 3% to 4%. If this happened, federal budget deficits would be lower than expected, because a stronger economy would produce more tax revenues.But, say the economists, lower tax rates and deregulation were tried in the 1980s. Airlines, interstate trucking, railroads and some energy markets were deregulated; the Tax Reform Act of 1986 cut tax rates sharply. ""There is little evidence that deregulation and tax reform increased productivity during this period,"" write the Nomura economists.All this is informative — up to a point. It reflects what standard economic models produce when they're fed plausible assumptions about Trump's policies. But it's possible that the full range of Trump's proposals will combine to change how the economy operates in ways that, for good or ill, defy the assumptions in existing models.Since World War II, the United States has had a ""mixed economy,"" with power shared between markets and government policy. In general, the drift has been toward more government. Moreover, for most of this period, the United States has been an ""open"" economy, emphasizing free trade and liberal immigration, both legal and illegal.Trump seems to embrace a different model, albeit one awash in inconsistencies. Though he urges less government, he bullies major corporations to locate their plants in the United States, not in Mexico, China or anywhere else abroad. Similarly, he deplores the rising federal debt but has pledged not to touch two of the largest programs — Social Security and Medicare — that contribute to the debt.All these changes collectively may alter the way the economy operates — to repeat, for good or ill. It may become more dynamic and productive; or it might become more protectionist and inflexible, as companies and consumers adapt cautiously to a more uncertain world. In either case, or many in between, the past is not prologue. Not even Donald Trump may really know what comes next.RELATED:Fed Officials Back 'Gradual' Rate Hikes, Citing Trump Fiscal PlansIn 2017, Fed Will Play Traffic Cop As Trump Hits Fiscal AccleratorFed Sees 3 More Hikes In 2017; 'Fiscal Boost Not Needed,' Yellen SaysYes, It's A Wonderful Life, But Not Such A Wonderful Economy

207,COP,"New Year predictions last almost as long as New Year's resolutions. A year ago, the Federal Reserve was forecasting four rate hikes in 2016 and Hillary Clinton was the favorite to win the presidency.The unknowns for 2017 start with the tone set by Washington. Will investors see ""good Trump"" or ""bad Trump""? Will Republicans repeal and replace ObamaCare?On the economic front, will OPEC and allies carry out oil production cuts — and how fast will U.S. shale companies boost output? Tesla (TSLA) is supposed to begin deliveries of its Model 3, but the roads are getting crowded with electric vehicles. Apple (AAPL) hopes the iPhone 8 will wow consumers and revive sales. Snapchat is set to go public; will Uber and other big unicorns follow?This new year may be as unpredictable as any, but here are 10 key issues and challenges to watch that will affect your investments and the economy.Investor's Business Daily's Ed Carson, Jed Graham, Allison Gatlin, Elaine Low, Gillian Rich, Patrick Seitz, Brian Deagon and Bill Peters contributed to this article.Donald Trump promises an ambitious agenda: a 15% corporate tax rate; repealing ObamaCare, Dodd-Frank and other regulations; and a $1 trillion infrastructure program. The U.S. economy has been stuck in second gear for years, with businesses reluctant to invest. The prospect of a Trump administration already has revived ""animal spirits,"" and the IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index and other business surveys show soaring confidence.But the populist president-elect has a zeal for conducting ad hoc industrial policy in public. He's used Twitter and TV to target United Technologies (UTX), Boeing (BA) and Lockheed Martin (LMT) as well as drug prices.And his protectionist instincts could have serious consequences, given a president's broad authority on trade. Trump could adopt a few anti-dumping duties on China, expanding on actions by Presidents Bush and Obama. Or he could withdraw from Nafta or trigger a full-blown trade war with China that roils the global economy.So far investors are betting that Trump's pro-growth, low-tax agenda will carry the day. Stocks have rallied strongly since Election Day. But some sectors — banks, steel, mining — have fared better than others.Before the election, the Federal Reserve worried that slow growth had become a chronic condition for the U.S. economy. In 2017 the Fed will shift to the role of traffic cop, trying to keep the economy from blowing past its speed limit.If Trump's fiscal fuel sparks inflationary pressures, the Fed could raise rates by more than the three quarter-point hikes that the central bank is predicting. But a positive scenario could play out if Trump's policies boost productivity, essentially raising the speed limit so the economy can drive faster without an upsurge in inflation.The Fed will likely follow financial markets' lead. In recent years, the Fed has spoken loudly but carried a Wiffle bat. Policymakers' goal of four rate hikes in 2016 was whittled down to one quarter-point move at year-end, in large part due to concerns about global markets.The Fed in 2017 will include two new Trump appointments to fill vacancies. Trump's appointees may be especially open to the idea that his deregulation and corporate tax cuts can help revive productivity growth and increase labor-force participation. And by year-end Trump likely will nominate his choice for Fed chief; Janet Yellen's term ends in February 2018.RELATED:In 2017, Fed Will Play Traffic Cop As Trump Hits Fiscal AcceleratorRepublicans appear intent on kicking off 2017 with a vote to repeal ObamaCare but may delay actually replacing the system for years.The health exchanges have been struggling, with younger and healthier people declining to sign up, even with the individual mandate. Republicans can get rid of the law's sweeping tax and spending provisions. But with only 52 votes in the Senate, GOP leaders couldn't overturn coverage mandates without at least some Democratic support.Republicans could repeal ObamaCare's Medicaid expansion, perhaps via block grants that would give states much more flexibility over federal funds.Yet many health policy experts and industry players have warned that a repeal without replacement could blow up the individual insurance market operating under ObamaCare rules. Many health insurers such as UnitedHealth (UNH) and Aetna (AET) are already pulling out of most exchanges, tired of suffering losses.They and their peers may throw in the towel entirely if the law is largely repealed without a long-term replacement. If wide swathes of the country lack an individual market insurer for 2018, what will the government do?RELATED:Trump, GOP Face Huge 'Now What?' ObamaCare MomentAfter a rough 2016 with drug prices under the campaign spotlight, a slew of potential FDA approvals and big trial data, particularly in the cancer arena, could catalyze biotech stocks.The FDA is slated to examine PARP inhibitors from Tesaro (TSRO) and Clovis Oncology (CLVS) to treat ovarian cancer. The duo will compete in a multibillion-dollar market with already-approved Lynparza from AstraZeneca (AZN). Celgene (CELG) has a multiple myeloma drug under FDA priority review. The FDA will also look at Ariad Pharmaceuticals' (ARIA) brigatinib, which fights non-small-cell lung cancer.Kite Pharma (KITE) is expected to seek approval for its refractory non-Hodgkin lymphoma drug, an early CAR-T treatment. Seattle Genetics (SGEN) aims to change traditional Hodgkin lymphoma therapy when it unveils phase-three data.Meanwhile, Axovant Sciences (AXON) and Biogen (BIIB) each have data on Alzheimer's treatments due in 2017. Drugs that significantly slow cognitive decline would be huge blockbusters.Some biomed companies may make announcements about drugs or financials at the annual JPMorgan Healthcare Conference in January.RELATED:Which Top 5 Biotech Stocks In 2016 Are Slated For Triple-Digit Gains?Seattle Genetics CEO Angles For Hodgkin's Lymphoma EurekaOil stocks have rallied since crude prices bottomed in early 2016, and the industry has reason for cautious optimism. After a two-year effort to drive out U.S. shale producers largely failed, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries — along with top non-OPEC producers — agreed to cut production by nearly 1.8 million barrels per day starting in January to prop up oil prices. But cartel members have a history of breaking production quotas.Russia already has said that it will only gradually lower production, and analysts expect Iraq to be the first OPEC member to cheat on its output target. Even if OPEC's plan fails, the International Energy Agency sees oil markets balancing in the second half of 2017, helped by rising demand.But will crude prices, which more than doubled from early 2016 lows, continue to climb? That may depend on how quickly U.S. shale production revives. U.S. crude output started to climb as the number of oil rigs in use rose sharply in recent weeks and months. Many shale players have cut their costs and can profit at lower oil price levels.Trump's pick for secretary of state, Exxon Mobil (XOM) CEO Rex Tillerson, is another bullish sign for U.S. oil companies headed into 2017, given Tillerson's experience with international energy trade deals.A lot rides on Apple's 11th-generation smartphone due out in the fall. Unofficially called the iPhone 8, the 10th anniversary model could sport a radical redesign, with a glass sandwich look, borderless OLED display, invisible home button and wireless charging.Bullish analysts believe the iPhone 8 could create a ""supercycle"" of upgrade activity after three generations of similar-looking iPhones. IPhone shipments fell 8% in Apple's fiscal 2016 ended Sept. 24 vs. a 4% decrease for the overall premium smartphone market.Many analysts see Apple returning to smartphone sales growth next year, thanks to the iPhone 8. Apple's fast-growing services business — which includes Apple Music, Apple Pay, iCloud and more — is another expected bright spot for 2017.Others are more pessimistic. Oppenheimer analyst Andrew Uerkwitz has predicted that ""Apple is about to embark on a decadelong malaise."" Apple's fortunes are over-reliant on the iPhone, and the company ""lacks the courage to lead the next generation of innovation (AI, cloud-based services, messaging),"" he said.Initial public offerings are expected to rebound in 2017 from a seven-year low. Among the first high-profile new stocks is likely to be Snapchat owner Snap, one of the widely watched tech ""unicorns"" valued above $1 billion. Snap's IPO, expected in the first quarter, could raise $4 billion and value the company at $25 billion.Snapchat is growing rapidly, but the parent company has struggled to turn a profit. And it faces competition from Facebook (FB), whose photo-sharing Instagram site is adopting Snapchat-like features.Other unicorns expected to go public in 2017 are music service provider Spotify, software maker AppDynamics and data analytics company Palantir. Uber, valued at $68 billion, is not expected to IPO in 2017. Neither is Airbnb.Renaissance Capital believes activity will pick up significantly in 2017, ""breaking the long IPO recession"" that started in August 2015.In 2016, 105 IPOs raised $18.8 billion. Both the number and dollar value fell 38% from 2015. The top-performing IPO of 2016 was optical components supplier Acacia Communications (ACIA), which is up 168.5% from its May IPO price of 23. But it has lost more than half its value since early September, ending the year at a five-month low.The overall stock market trend will be critical to IPO activity and success. If the postelection rally continues, more companies will go public and will likely fare well. But if the stock indexes move sideways or correct, unicorns will be rare.RELATED:IPO Outlook For 2017: Amid Mixed Predictions, Focus On The Chart ActionThe electric-car race will intensify when Tesla Motors introduces its long-awaited Model 3 in the second half of 2017. It will be Tesla's most affordable car, with a base-model cost of about $35,000, far less than the more-upscale Model S sedan and Model X crossover SUV.Tesla is on track to deliver about 80,000 vehicles in 2016 and aims to ramp up auto production to 500,000 deliveries a year by 2018.Tesla has a history of missing deadlines and cutting production targets, though CEO Elon Musk will strive to get at least some Model 3 vehicles out the door next year. Musk also will be busy integrating recently acquired SolarCity as well as completing Tesla's battery Gigafactory.Meanwhile, General Motors (GM), Ford (F), Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Toyota (TM) and Volkswagen (VLKAY) are selling or planning to introduce all-electric vehicles that target many of the same potential buyers as the Model 3. Like the Model 3, they will have self-driving features.Tesla also faces threats from tech giants such as Alphabet (GOOGL) and Apple. Alphabet has spun out its self-driving car efforts into its own unit, Waymo. But the Google parent has backed off plans to create vehicles with no steering wheel or pedals in favor of partnerships with existing carmakers.Apple, which has never acknowledged its Project Titan efforts, reportedly has shifted from making a self-driving electric car to developing operating systems for autonomous vehicles.Mobileye (MBLY) and Delphi (DLPH) will showcase their turnkey autonomous-driving technology at CES 2017 in early January.It's still unclear if electric cars are ready for mass adoption. They are more expensive than gas-powered vehicles — and federal tax credits will soon expire for new Tesla buyers. And charging takes far longer than filling up the tank.Fears of cord-cutting — pay-TV subscribers canceling their cable packages — continue to abound in the media space. But a recent PwC survey, which found that 76% of respondents were pay-TV subscribers in 2016 vs. 79% the year before, suggests that ""cord-cutting may continue at a much slower rate than predicted.""Still, subscriber losses at ESPN, owned by Walt Disney (DIS), raise concerns about the power of live sports programming to discourage viewers from dumping their all-inclusive cable packages.Hulu — owned by Disney, 21st Century Fox (FOXA), Comcast (CMCSA) unit NBCUniversal and Time Warner (TWX) — plans to roll out a live-streaming service in the new year that will include broadcast and cable networks. Google's YouTube is also said to be working on a streaming TV service that could go live in 2017.The two players would join a crop of over-the-top TV competitors including Sling TV (Dish Network (DISH)), PlayStation Vue (Sony (SNE)) and DirecTV Now (AT&T (T)).After a long slog through years of low rates, weak economic growth and post-crisis regulation, banks appear set for a better 2017. Trump's transition team has said the incoming president will ""dismantle"" Dodd-Frank. His tax-and-spending programs could boost demand but also lift inflation, triggering more Federal Reserve rate hikes. Wider yield spreads should expand banks' net interest margins.All this sent bank stocks soaring along with Treasury yields in late 2016, especially after the presidential election. Bank of America (BAC) is seen as the most U.S.-exposed of the big banks, meaning it is most likely to benefit from any rate hikes from the Fed and faster U.S. economic growth.Meanwhile, Citigroup (C) still has significant international operations that could be hurt if Trump sets U.S. trade deals ablaze.Dozens of smaller banks have hit multiyear highs. Bank investors are pricing in aggressive Fed and Trump moves in 2017 with bond yields continuing to climb. But if those actions do not occur, bank earnings and stocks may disappoint.RELATED:2017 Personal Finance Action Plan & 2016 Stock Market Review

208,COP,"One insistent question that will shape 2017 is whether we're witnessing the gradual decay of the post-World War II international order, dominated by the economic and military power of the United States.After the Soviet Union's collapse in 1991, it became fashionable to talk of the United States as the only true superpower. Pax Americana would promote peace and prosperity. Globalization and trade would bind countries together. The American economic and political model, mixing markets and government oversight, would be emulated. Higher living standards would bolster democratic ideas and institutions.As for raw military power, no country could challenge the United States. The 1990-91 Gulf War seemed to prove this. Of course, there were fearsome nuclear weapons. But they seemed safely stalemated. Few countries had them, and the largest arsenals, the American and Russian, seemed neutered by a shared understanding that everyone would lose in a nuclear exchange. The stage was set for what one prominent commentator called ""the end of history.""It wasn't. Obviously, this reassuring vision no longer describes the real world, if it ever did. On all fronts, the actual future confounds the imagined future.Economies around the world have slowed. In virtually every major country — the United States, China, Germany — growth has declined from what it once was, creating a global slowdown. Not surprisingly, the supposed connection between greater prosperity and democratic politics failed to materialize.Democratic disillusion has paralleled economic disappointment. Globalization and trade have fallen into disrepute, charged with reducing the wages and jobs of industrial workers in advanced societies. With aging populations, governments in these countries are overcommitted. They struggle to pay costly welfare benefits. Public opinion, rather than strengthening democratic ideals, has veered toward economic populism and nationalism. Hello Brexit and Donald Trump.The notion of a sole surviving superpower has also fared poorly. Power is the ability to get (or take) what you want. By this standard, China and Russia rank as important powers. Indeed, the very term ""superpower"" may be misleading or obsolete. The United States cannot get everything it wants simply by dispatching troops to hot spots.Finally, the nuclear consensus is fraying. North Korea has atomic weapons; Iran may someday get them. The more countries that have atomic arms, the more likely that someone will make a catastrophic miscalculation.After World War II, the United States stumbled upon a global strategy. It would protect its allies militarily while hoping that peace would promote prosperous, stable and democratic societies. Communism's psychological and political appeal would be rejected. Despite many setbacks, the strategy generally succeeded. Europe and Japan rebuilt; the Soviet Union failed; communism was discredited.It is this narrative that the United States sought to project onto the post-Cold War international order. What we did not anticipate was the reaction of other countries and the complexity of history.The international order is now in a state of flux for many reasons. Starting with China and Russia, many countries resent the United States' leadership role. Many Americans have also tired of it. New technologies (notably, e-commerce, cyberwar) are further redistributing power and influence.What's curious is that American leaders have sometimes contributed to the decline of U.S. power. Barack Obama's disdain of military force is so deeply felt and visible that the use of America's fighting capabilities was often discounted by allies and adversaries alike, as in Syria. This has consequences, as my colleague Richard Cohen has knowingly written:""Since the end of World War II, American leadership has been essential to maintain world peace. Whether we liked it or not, we were the world's policeman. There was no other cop on the beat. Now that leadership is gone. So, increasingly, will be peace.""Trump has his own ideas about weakening the international order. His chosen field is trade. He threatens to slap stiff tariffs on U.S. imports from China and Mexico. If these ignite a trade war, the adverse side effects may well backfire on American workers and firms. The last time mass protectionism was tried as economic stimulus was the 1930s; the experiment did not end well.There is a larger issue here. In his latest book, ""World Order,"" Henry Kissinger argues that the world is at its greatest peril when the international order is moving from one system to another. ""Restraints disappear, and the field is open to the most expansive claims and the most implacable actors,"" he writes. ""Chaos follows until a new system of order is established."" It's a sobering warning.

210,COP,"U.S. oil rigs rose by three this week to 477, according to Baker Hughes (BHI) data out Friday, as drilling jumped in Texas, but crude prices extended already-huge weekly gains.The oil rig count has climbed in 24 of the last 27 weeks, with drillers adding a total of 161 oil rigs in that time.This week, the Permian Basin in West Texas saw the biggest increase as the tally rose by seven to 235, after falling by one in the week prior. Rigs in the Eagle Ford in South Texas were up by two to 34 but fell by two in Colorado's DJ Niobrara to 18.U.S. crude futures rose 1.2% to $51.68 a barrel, closing the week with a gain of 12.2%.

212,COP,"U.S. shale producers were the big winners of OPEC's decision Wednesday to cut production by 1.2 million barrels per day, but the deal won't immediately fix high debt loads, lack of skilled workers and other issues that shale producers need to resolve before ramping up production.West Texas Intermediate futures rose 3.3% to $51.06 a barrel on Thursday, the highest close since Oct. 19, after jumping 9% the day before. Brent futures rose as high as $54.53, the highest since July 2015.""There were casualties on capital spending  and future capital spending, so even though the war is over and welcomed by everyone, thinking the U.S. producers are going to ramp up production to where they were even a year ago is ill-conceived,"" said Phil Flynn, a senior market analyst at the Price Futures Group.Domestic crude production has edged up to the highest level in nearly six months, but Flynn thinks it will take a least a year before output really heats up in the U.S.""Companies are going to need more capital from banks, and it will be more difficult to borrow money because they have been burned in the past.""During the downturn, shale firms relied on bank loans or debt and stock sales to keep the lights on and rigs running.ConocoPhillips (COP) has said it would use cash from higher oil prices to first reduce debt before expanding operations. In May, EOG Resources (EOG) said it would first fund capital expenditures with cash flow, reduce net debt with property sales, and then complete drilled but uncompleted wells before starting to drill new wells.But Flynn said Conoco, Occidental Petroleum (OXY)and Oasis Petroleum (OAS) have a lot of capital and should be winners in the shale patch.Finding skilled workers and functioning equipment will be another major hurdle for the industry as rigs were retired or put in storage, and thousands of employees found other jobs after being laid off during the bust.Meanwhile, the latest surge in oil prices still isn't enough for many producers to jump back into the fray.Jason Wangler, managing director Wunderlich, told IBD oil would have to reach $60 per barrel before ""you'll see an absolute rush"" of producers ramping up activity. ""But $50 is a lot better than $40,"" and he expects U.S. shale companies' capital spending to be up 20% to 25% in 2017 vs. 2016.Last month, EOG said the U.S. shale industry needs oil prices of $60 a barrel to ramp up drilling.But Conoco, Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) and Devon Energy (DVN) will be able to boost activity at $50 per barrel, according to research company Wood Mackenzie in a Financial Times article.And costs are going up. Oil field service providers plan to roll back discounts offered during the depths of the price crash. In October, Halliburton (HAL) indicated that it was willing to increase its prices even if it means losing some customers.Still, technological advances have helped Continental Resources (CLR) reduce drilling time in the Bakken, and EOG has found a way to use cheap natural gas in fracking. But an estimated 80% of cost savings during the downturn came from service providers slashing costs.Shares of Continental Resources dipped 0.8% to close at 57.55 on the stock market today, but that's after surging 23% on Wednesday, breaking out of a cup with handle base. Occidental dipped  slightly to 71.27, Oasis ticked up 3 cents to 15. EOG climbed 2.2% to 104.75, above buy range, after jumping 11% Wednesday on the OPEC news. Halliburton added 0.3% to 53.24. Conoco lost 0.6% to 48.22 while Pioneer shares fell 0.8% to 189.57. Devon finished the day down 1% to 47.85.IBD'S TAKE: OPEC's announcement send shale stocks are soaring, see which shale plays are now buys.While rig counts have been rising in the Permian and Colorado's DJ Niobrara basin, Flynn said most of the recent rigs were added to replace rigs in decline or to hold leases.U.S. producers also could be hesitant to ramp up activity as the OPEC deal is contingent on Russia and other nonmembers scaling back output.The certainty of the deal was already in question Wednesday as Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak cautioned that Russia will ""gradually"" reduce due to technical issues. OPEC will meet with nonmembers to work out the details on Dec. 9.RELATED: U.S. Crude Production Hits Highest Level In Nearly 6 MonthsDover, Machinery Stocks Soar On Oil Prices, Infrastructure Hopes

213,COP,"What is President-elect Donald Trump up to on foreign policy? It's a question with no clear answer. Some will dismiss his appointments and tweets as expressing no more than the impulses of an ignorant and undisciplined temperament — no more premeditated than the lunges of a rattlesnake.Others may recall that similar things were said (by me, as well as many others) about his campaign strategy. But examination of the entrails of the election returns suggests that Trump was following a deliberate strategy based on shrewd insight when he risked antagonizing white college-educated voters in the process of appealing to non-college-educated whites.Antagonizing college graduates cost him scads of popular votes — but zero electoral votes — in states such as California, Arizona, Texas and Georgia. But his appeal to non-college-educated whites in Florida, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin, Iowa and Maine's 2nd Congressional District won him just enough popular votes to capture 100 electoral votes that had gone for President Barack Obama in 2012.So maybe Trump knew what he was doing. It seems to me that like many rich men, he has original insights that, together with hard work and good luck, have made him successful, even while showing boundless ignorance or mindless delusion about other things.So let's examine Trump's actions and comments on foreign policy so far in that light and in light of the speculations of historian and Henry Kissinger biographer Niall Ferguson, who, in an American Interest article last month, sketched out what a ""Kissinger-inspired strategy"" by Trump might look like.Ferguson argued that Trump is pursuing what Kissinger's most admired American statesman, Theodore Roosevelt, also sought: ""a world run by regional great powers with strong men in command, all of whom understand that any lasting international order must be based on the balance of power.""That seems in line with Trump's moves vis-a-vis China. He ostentatiously took a congratulatory call from Taiwan's president, and the first foreign leader to make a postelection visit to Trump Tower was Japan's Shinzo Abe. Both are signals that Trump will look askance at China's moves to establish sovereignty in the first island chain.But then he tapped as ambassador to Beijing Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad, whose friendship with Xi Jinping goes back to the Chinese leader's visit to Iowa in 1985. Those moves look like a good cop-bad cop routine. Trump wants some changes in trade relations with China and limits on its probes in the South China Sea and will build up U.S. military forces. But there's room for acceptance of China as a great power.There's room for acceptance of Russia, too, as suggested by the secretary of state nomination of Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson, self-proclaimed friend of Russian President Vladimir Putin's. He may be opposed by Republican senators who, like Mitt Romney in 2012, see Russia as ""our No. 1 geopolitical foe."" But perhaps Trump favors Kissinger's proposal for a neutral and decentralized (i.e., dominated and partitioned) Ukraine, with an end to sanctions on Russia. Tillerson would be a good choice if that were your goal.This would make the Baltic States and Poland understandably nervous, but they could take some comfort in Trump's reaffirmation of our NATO pledge to defend them and in the fact that Pentagon nominee James Mattis has gone out of his way to honor Estonia for its sacrifices in Iraq and Afghanistan.As for the rest of Europe, Ferguson cited Kissinger's urging that it move ""from bureaucratic introspection back to strategic responsibility."" Finance ministers, stung by Trump's campaign criticisms, are ponying up more money to meet their NATO defense spending commitments; German Chancellor Angela Merkel is backing down from her disastrous decision to welcome 1 million ""refugees.""Long-standing U.S. cheerleading for the European Union reached a crescendo when President Obama threatened that Britain would go to ""the back of the queue"" if it voted to leave the EU. Trump supported Brexit and has supported a U.S.-U.K. free trade agreement. He obviously doesn't have much use for multinational talking shops.In the Middle East, will Trump ditch the Iranian nuclear deal or police it aggressively? Will he bolster the tacit Sunni-Israeli alliance against the expansion of Iranian influence? Unclear, though Mattis and Tillerson could help with both.Trump's moves and picks so far are not inconsistent with Ferguson's supposition that his strategy is to seek accommodations with regional powers led by strongmen, showing even less regard for and paying even less lip service to human rights than Obama. We'll see.

214,COP,"The International Energy Agency warned in a report Thursday that sluggish economic growth will continue to weigh on demand for oil, and ConocoPhillips (COP) cut its capital spending for next year.The IEA sees demand growth at 1.2 million barrels per day in 2017, the same increase as it forecasts for this year, after climbing by 1.8 million bpd in 2015.""There is currently little evidence to suggest that economic activity is sufficiently robust to deliver higher oil demand growth, and any stimulus that might have been provided at the end of 2015 and in the early part of 2016 when crude oil prices fell below $30 a barrel is now in the past,"" the energy watchdog said.Brent futures closed down 1.1% to $45.84 per barrel. U.S. crude fell 1.4% to $44.83.Exxon Mobil (XOM) finished up 0.9% on the stock market today. Chevron (CVX) rose 0.1% and BP (BP) 0.3%. Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) climbed 0.5%. Continental Resources (CLR) added 0.2, but EOG Resources (EOG) lost 0.9%.IBD'S TAKE: Oil prices could fall before rising. Goldman Sachs warned that oil could plummet to near $40 per barrel if OPEC can't implement its production cut.While demand looks to stay weak, oil producers are pumping out more. The IEA said global supply was up by 800,000 per day in October, hitting 97.8 million barrels per day on record OPEC production and increased output from Russia, Kazakhstan and Brazil.Non-OPEC production is expected to grow by 500,000 barrels per day in 2017 vs. a drop of 900,000 barrels per day this year.The supply outlook will worsen if OPEC fails to implement a production cut its biannual meeting in Vienna on Nov. 30. IEA OPEC's production last month hit 33.83 million barrels a day, well above the target of 32.5 million-33 million agreed upon this summer.""If no agreement is reached and some individual members continue to expand their production then the market will remain in surplus throughout the year, with little prospect of oil prices rising significantly higher,"" the IEA warned. ""Indeed, if the supply surplus persists in 2017 there must be some risk of prices falling back.""On Tuesday, OPEC said that oil demand could peak by 2029 if the Paris climate agreement is fully executed. But in May now President-Elect Donald Trump said he would ""cancel"" the deal, putting the agreement in doubt.Meanwhile, ConocoPhillips lowered its 2017 capex budget by 4% to $5 billion and said it would sell $5 billion to $8 billion in North American natural gas assets, ahead of an analyst meeting. The oil company sees Brent at $50 per barrel next year and production flat to up 2%.""During the past two years, we have significantly transformed ConocoPhillips to succeed in a lower, more volatile price environment,"" CEO Ryan Lance said in a statement. ""We've lowered the capital intensity and break-even price of the company, lowered the cost of supply of our investment portfolio, and created strategic flexibility for future price cycles.""Earlier, BP lowered its capital expenditure outlook for the year and was cautious on 2017, while Shell downgraded its spending outlook for next year.ConocoPhillips fell 2.1% Thursday, despite plans for a $3 billion share buyback.RELATED:Permian Lifts U.S. Oil Rig Count After Falling A Week AgoTotal, CNPC To Win $6 Billion Iran Gas Deal Years After Sanctions Pushed Them Out

215,COP,"Exxon Mobil (XOM) warned Friday that it could make the biggest reserves revision since its 1999 merger, if crude prices don't climb higher, as it faces investigations into how it values its assets.The oil major said 3.6 billion barrels of reserves in the Canadian oil sands and another 1 billion barrels in other North American plays could be taken off the books because they aren't profitable at current prices.Exxon noted that such a ""de-booking"" wouldn't affect the actual operation of related projects or change guidance on future production volumes.But the reserves warning comes as Exxon is under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the New York Attorney General for not writing down assets, which have lost value during oil's two-year downturn, according to reports last month.While crude prices have recovered recently, momentum has stalled in recent weeks. U.S. futures have hit a ceiling at about $50 per barrel, well below their pre-bust level above $100.Exxon shares dropped 2.5% to close at 84.78 on the stock market today, undercutting their 50-day and 200-day lines.IBD'S TAKE: Oil markets are expected to rebalance next year, but oil majors face another potential crisis as the rise of electric vehicles could make another contraction happen sooner than expected.Meanwhile, Exxon said Q3 earnings dropped 38% to 63 cents per share, but beat analyst views by 5 cents, as revenue fell 12.9% to $58.68 billion, under views for $61.34 billion.Capital spending dropped 45% and oil production dipped 5.1%, with natural gas production up 0.8%. Downstream earnings sank 66.7% to $1.2 billion. Upstream profit fell 16% to $620 million as refining margins in the U.S. were 35% lower than a year ago.Late Thursday, Exxon reported a large offshore find near Nigeria that could hold 1.4 billion barrels of oil.Chevron's (CVX) Q3 EPS fell 37.6% to 68 cents, smashing analyst views by 31 cents. But revenue fell 12.1% to $29 billion, slightly under views for $29.05 billion.The U.S. upstream loss narrowed to $212 million vs. $603 million a year ago, and the international upstream profit rose 0.6% to $666 million. Chevron's U.S. downstream profit sank 58% to $523 million and international downstream dove 43.7% to $542 million.Shares jumped 3.9% to 103.82.On Thursday, ConocoPhillips (COP) reported an adjusted net loss of 66 cents, a penny better than analysts expected on revenue of $6.52 billion. The oil company raised its full-year production outlook while lowering its capital spending guidance. Shares finished the trading day up 2.2% to 44.97.Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) and BP (BP) will announce quarterly results Tuesday along with shale exploration and production companies Devon Energy (DVN) and Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD). Shell lost 1.3% to 49.87. Devon tumbled 3.1% to 39.18, while Pioneer slipped 0.6% to 181.63.Late Thursday, General Electric (GE) said that it's in talks with oil services firm Baker Hughes (BHI) about an alliance, but not an outright purchase. The talks come after Halliburton (HAL) abandoned its take over bid for Baker Hughes over regulatory concerns.Baker Hughes shares soared 8.4% to 59.12, while GE was up 2.1% to 29.22.

""In the third quarter we achieved cash flow neutrality, with operating cash flow covering capital expenditures and the dividend.""Stock: Shares shot up 5.3% to close at 44.00 on the stock market today, helped by a 1.1% rally in U.S. crude futures though they stopped short of the $50-a-barrel level.

218,COP,"Donald Trump's unexpected presidential win shook up global markets, triggering a major sector rotation. Alibaba (BABA) reported solid sales for Singles Day. Walt Disney sees better growth, but not until 2018, while most department stores generally see a positive holiday season while Nvidia (NVDA) led strong chip results.Stock futures crashed Tuesday night as Donald Trump won the presidential election, but rallied Wednesday as investors saw upside to his tax and infrastructure plans. Investors rushed into banks, drugs, materials-related stocks and out of big-name techs such as Apple (AAPL), Amazon.com (AMZN) and Facebook (FB), as well as defensive consumer staples and gunmakers. The Dow soared 5.4% for the week, its best since December 2011, hitting a record high Thursday. The S&P 500 jumped 3.8%, its best week in two years, rebounding above its 50-day line. The Nasdaq also rose 3.8% but ended the week below its 50-day. Gold prices initially jumped on Trump's win but crashed  as stocks rallied, Treasury yields skyrocketed and Fed rate-hike expectations firmed. Copper prices boomed. Nvidia and Priceline (PCLN) were among leading stocks reporting strong results.Top chip companies Nvidia, Microchip Technology (MCHP), MaxLinear (MXL) and Microsemi (MSCC) saw their stocks rise after posting better-than-expected quarterly results. Graphics chipmaker Nvidia earned 84 cents a share, up 91% year over year, on sales of $2 billion, up 54%. Wall Street expected 57 cents and $1.69 billion. Nvidia also raised its Q4 sales target above views. Microchip EPS rose 42% and sales 56%. MaxLinear also topped views, though guidance was weak due to legacy-product declines. Nvidia shares skyrocketed 30% on Friday to a new high. For the week so far, Microchip rose 4.8%, MaxLinear 12% and Microsemi 9.7%.Walt Disney (DIS) missed fiscal Q4 estimates and warned that 2017 would be ""an anomaly"" in its growth arc, with the box-office-melting success of ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" making for a tough year-over-year comparison. But investors may already be looking to fiscal 2018, when Disney will release four Marvel movies and two more ""Star Wars"" films. Disney also said that the factors that have caused ESPN to lose subscribers ""have abated,"" and that the sports network would likely continue to grow as ESPN adapts to more digital platforms. Disney shares rose nearly 6% for the week so far.Macy's (M) missed Q3 estimates but cited strong results from Apple and Michael Kors (KORS) products that should continue in the current holiday quarter. (But luxury apparel maker Kors itself warned on its holiday sales). Macy's raised its full-year same-store sales forecast. Kohl's (KSS) reported Q3 EPS and revenue above expectations, with strong back-to-school and October sales that should continue into the holiday season. Nordstrom (JWN) crushed EPS growth estimates. The upscale department store operator raised its full year EPS guidance to $2.85-$2.95, well above Wall Street estimates. However, J.C. Penney (JCP) sales missed expectations and cut its sales forecast.But shares of all four retailers enjoyed double-digit percentage gains for the week.Priceline reported Q3 earnings and revenue that topped estimates, sending its shares to an all-time high. Priceline also said interim CEO Brett Keller is taking over as permanent chief executive, effective immediately. TripAdvisor (TRIP), a Priceline rival, reported weaker-than-expected Q3 revenue, sending shares falling.E-commerce giant Alibaba Group processed $17.8 billion worth of sales on China's biggest online shopping day of the year, known as Singles Day. That busted last year's record of $14.3 billion. But growth slowed to 24% from 60% last year. Alibaba takes a small percentage of sales for managing the transaction for vendors. Alibaba shares fell 1.4% Friday, extending a slide since late September.The Singles Day event towers over the U.S. shopping events known as Black Friday and Cyber Monday. Black Friday last year had total sales of $4.5 billion, and Cyber Monday had $3 billion.Chinese online game maker and portal NetEase (NTES) earned $3.42 per U.S. share excluding items in the third quarter, up 47%. Sales rose 38% to $1.38 billion in Q3. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected NetEase to earn $2.89 per share excluding items on sales of $1.43 billion. Online games accounted for 71% of revenue. NetEase tumbled 3.6% for the week afternoon, falling significantly below its 50-day line for the first time since April.Gold prices skyrocketed Tuesday night as stock futures and the dollar initially tumbled on fears that a Trump win would spur massive selling and put the Fed on ice. But with stocks actually faring well and bond yields spiking, gold prices quickly reversed for a weekly loss of more than 6%, the worst since 2013. Gold mining stocks that retook some key technical levels went back down. Newmont Mining (NEM) fell 16%, Barrick Gold (ABX) 19%. Meanwhile, industrial miners rallied as Trump infrastructure plans lifted copper, other industrial metals and materials.China-based Momo (MOMO) reported Q3 earnings that beat estimates, which the company credited to its success with live video. The provider of a video streaming website and mobile social platform said revenue surged 319% to $157 million, soaring past estimates of $130.5 million. Momo sees Q4 revenue of $185 million-$190 million, above forecasts for $140.2 million.But Momo's stock, which initially rose to a new high, reversed sharply lower to trade down more than 8%.Acacia Communications (ACIA) late Thursday reported Q3 earnings minus items that rose 240% to $1.01, as revenue jumped 107% to $135.3 million. Analysts had modeled non-GAAP EPS of 81 cents and revenue of $130.8 million after Acacia revised guidance twice during the quarter. The maker of high-speed optical devices for communications networks sees adjusted EPS of 85-92 cents vs. views of 78 cents. But revenue of $138.5 million at the midpoint of its guidance is just above the consensus for $137.2 million. Acacia fell 1% Friday but rose 12.8% for the week.Fabrinet (FN) late Monday said fiscal Q1 EPS leapt 78% to 80 cents while revenue was up 53% to $332 million, its fourth straight quarter of accelerating growth. Both easily beat analyst estimates. Fabrinet also gave upbeat EPS and sales guidance for the current Q2. Fabrinet shares rose 8.9% for the week.Oil prices initially rose but closed down 1.5% to $43.41 a barrel — the third straight weekly slide — amid concerns about rising supply and weak demand. Meanwhile, President-elect Donald Trump has called for less regulation and more drilling for the U.S. industry, which could ultimately boost supply further. Weekly U.S. crude stockpiles rose by 2.43 million barrels, the Energy Information Administration said, an increase that was above analyst expectations. OPEC said its October production hit a record high, adding doubts that it will finalize and implement a production-cut agreement. The International Energy Agency warned that sluggish economic growth will continue to weigh on oil demand, and ConocoPhillips (COP) cut its capital spending for next year.

222,COP," We knew there could be a big October surprise before this bizarre and unpopular election finally came to an end. But who knew it would come from emails found on a device used by former Rep. Anthony Weiner, which was confiscated by the FBI after he sexted an underage woman -- an act that cost him his job, his income and his marriage?As I pondered this on Friday afternoon, I had a faint recollection of Winston Churchill describing a tough loss in an MP election. Hat tip to Susan Varga, who located this Churchill gem: ""In a twinkling of an eye, I found myself without an office, without a seat, without a party, and without an appendix."" Churchill had his appendix taken out during that election, which took place in 1922.So let's see here. Anthony Weiner lost his office and his seat. And while I don't know about his appendix, he did  lose his marriage for referring to matters below the waist.And Huma Abedin, Hillary Clinton's aide and Weiner's soon to be ex-wife, may well lose her seat and her office, although I couldn't find any information about her appendix, despite a long Google search.On the other hand, the FBI's bombshell that it is reopening the investigation into Hillary Clinton's private email server may well cause the Democratic presidential candidate to lose her office, her seat and her party. As to the condition of her appendix, we'll just have to guess, since no one knows the state of her deteriorating health.And then we have FBI director James Comey, who may well be on his way to losing his office, his seat and his reputation. (I have no information on the status of his appendix.)And how bizarrely ironic is it that Comey -- who lost considerable credibility a couple of months ago for building an iron-clad case against Clinton only to let her off the hook -- is now reopening her case based not on Russian espionage or Julian Assange's WikiLeaks, but on Anthony Weiner's electronic sex life?This will not bring honor and glory to J. Edgar Hoover's venerable crime-fighting organization. Comey's announcement, by the way, follows hot on the heels of the revelation that Clinton pal and Virginia governor Terry McAuliffe channeled near $500,000 into the failed state senate campaign of Jill McCabe, who is the wife of FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe, who helped oversee the agency's investigation into Clinton's private email server. And let it be known that Hillary Clinton helped raise $1 million for McAuliffe's PAC.Did any of these connections have anything to do with Clinton's getting off scot free from a criminal indictment? Nah.But wait, could it be that Donald Trump's accusation that the system is rigged is correct after all?Now, from Churchill to Jack Webb. Remember him? He played LAPD Detective Sergeant Joe Friday on the great Dragnet series. He opened the show with, ""This is the city: Los Angeles, California. I work here. I'm a cop.""But the straight shooting Detective Friday may be better known for this deadpan phrase: ""Just the facts, ma'am."" Those are words that may go to the very heart of this presidential election.No matter what James Comey unveils in the days ahead, if anything, virtually no one in this country believes Hillary Clinton will ever divulge ""just the facts.""That's what the polls say, and for her they're getting worse. And that's exactly what the FBI bombshell has reminded the voting public. Clinton, Inc., is dishonest, above the law, on the take.New WikiLeaks-provided emails from Clinton aide Doug Band reveal the true nature of the Clinton cash operation: No matter what the stated humanitarian goals of the Clinton Foundation, every fiber and sinew of the organization is wrapped in self-dealing, self-enrichment, fraud and corruption.This is how the Clintons got rich. They traded cash for State Department visits and cash for government favors. And let's not forget those $450,000 speeches by Bill Clinton and those $250,000 speeches by Hillary herself.And she can't even tell the truth about that, as leaked emails show that she said one thing to Wall Street and quite another to the public.The election is a week and a half away, and the atmosphere has changed significantly. In the last several days, at long last, Donald Trump has been talking issues on the campaign trail. Issues like the economy, tax cuts, the need to repeal and rewrite Obamacare, and even African American inner-city problems. During this period, Hillary Clinton was deluged with email leaks and blindsided by the FBI.Issues beat email leaks. Polls are rapidly narrowing.

223,COP,"It was a huge week for earnings. Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL) were A-list headliners, but a slew of industrials, medicals, restaurants and more also reported. Tesla Motors (TSLA) reported a surprise profit, while Qualcomm (QCOM) will buy NXP Semiconductors (NXPI).The Nasdaq fell 1.3% for the week, with Amazon's miss and Apple's modest beat failing to impress. The tech-heavy index dropped below its 50-day line after retaking that level last week. The S&P 500 sank 0.7%, while the Dow rose 0.1%. Bonds continued to fall around the world, pushing the 10-year Treasury yield to multimonth highs.In the September quarter, Apple earned $1.67 a share, down 15% year over year, on sales of $46.85 billion, down 9%. Analysts expected Apple to earn $1.66 a share on sales of $46.94 billion. For the holiday quarter, Apple guided Wall Street higher on revenue, but its profit margin outlook came up short. Apple also unveiled new MacBook Pro notebook computers, which feature a touch-screen strip for application commands and shortcuts that replaces the function keys. Apple fell 2.5% for the week, but remains above its 50-day line.Amazon reported Q3 earnings of 52 cents a share, a big gain but well short of estimates for 78 cents. The e-commerce giant plowed money into its Amazon Web Services cloud computing unit, along with a big expansion of fulfillment centers heading into the holiday season. Revenue rose 29% to $32.7 billion, meeting views. AWS was among the bright spots in the earnings report as revenue rose 55% year over year to $3.23 billion, beating the consensus. Q4 revenue guidance also lagged. Amazon shares fell 5.2% Friday, closing below its 50-day line for the first time in months.Q3 earnings per share minus items rose 23% to $9.06 while total revenue climbed 20% to $22.45 billion vs. consensus estimates of $8.60 and $22.05 billion. Google-parent Alphabet signaled higher investments in its  cloud computing business and higher Q4 marketing costs tied to the September launch of Pixel-branded smartphones and a smart home speaker that competes with Amazon's Echo. Google's Q3 net revenue — despite higher traffic acquisition costs (TAC) costs of $4.18 billion — was $18.27 billion, topping views.Alphabet shares nearly hit a record high Friday morning, but closed the day fractionally higher and the week fractionally lower, but still in buy range.Tesla Motors earned 71 cents a share excluding items, soundly beating the consensus estimate of a 54-cent loss. Revenue climbed 45% to $2.3 billion, up 45% and topping estimates of $1.977 billion. Elon Musk had pushed Tesla to boost deliveries and turn a profit in Q3, but some analysts are skeptical that the effort is sustainable. Tesla maintained its guidance of 50,000 vehicle deliveries for the second half of 2016, with a Q4 plan of just over 25,000.Tesla and SolarCity (SCTY) late Friday were expected to unveil an integrated product offering of solar panels, battery storage and charger.

Santa Clara, Calif.-based Gigamon said Q3 EPS minus items rose 64% to 36 cents, while revenue jumped 47% to $83.5 million. Analysts had projected 31 cents and $79.6 million. In the current quarter, Gigamon forecast EPS of 37 cents and revenue of $92 million at its midpoint of guidance vs. consensus estimates of 33 cent profit and 29% revenue growth to $86 million. Analysts say AT&T (T) may be a new customer, joining T-Mobile US (TMUS).Gigamon shot up 16.1% Friday, hitting a record high intraday. Shares had fallen 5.2% Thursday to below its 50-day line.Lumentum (LITE) said Q1 EPS rose 69% to 44 cents and revenue climbed 19% to $252.3 million, topping expectations but current quarter revenue guidance was light amid a telecom component shortage from an unnamed supplier. EPS guidance of 51 cents at the midpoint was above consensus estimates of 49 cents. Lumentum fell 3.7% after its late Thursday report, but that followed a 4.3% fall Thursday as Acacia Communications (ACIA) crashed 16% that day and for the week. Chinese telecom gear giant ZTE, a key Acacia customer, reported weak revenue.Qualcomm announced a deal to buy NXP Semiconductors for $39 billion, creating the No. 2 chipmaker by revenue after Intel (INTC). Including debt, the deal is worth $47 billion. Mobile-communications chipmaker Qualcomm said the acquisition will expand its footprint into key growth markets, including automotive, Internet of Things, security and networking. The Qualcomm-NXP transaction marks the biggest semiconductor deal ever, surpassing Avago Technologies' $37 billion purchase of Broadcom (AVGO).New Oriental Education and Technology (EDU) met fiscal Q1 EPS views with a 15% gain to 90 cents. Revenue climbed 16.5%, above analysts' expectations, as enrollment boomed. The IBD 50 stock sees Q2 revenue above analyst guidance. Fellow Chinese for-profit school stock TAL Education (XRS) Q2 results topped estimates as total student enrollment jumped 77%. It guided Q3 revenue above Wall Street views. New Oriental stock rose more than 10% for the week, blasting out of a base to a new high. TAL Education climbed 12%, also to a high.RELATED:New Oriental Education Breaks Out On Strong Revenue, GuidanceTAL Education Stock Enters Profit-Taking Sell Territory After Q2 BeatChipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) earned 27 cents a share, down 94%, while revenue fell nearly 15% to $1.04 billion, both worse than expected. Same-store sales tumbled 21.9% as fast-casual burrito chain still struggles to recover from late 2015 food-borne illness outbreaks. Shares fell 9% Wednesday, hitting a 3-year low. Panera Bread (PNRA) beat views, sending the stock higher intraday Wednesday, but reversed lower, falling to an eight-month low on Thursday. Buffalo Wild Wings (BWLD) met EPS views and missed on sales, but shares rose 6% Thursday from recent lows.Food delivery services provider GrubHub (GRUB) reported that EPS rose 73% and revenue 44%, both topping. But Grubhub's active diners rose by 19%, missing estimates slightly. Shares, which had been near an 18-month high, fell nearly 13% on Wednesday, tumbling below its 50-day line.Biogen (BIIB) posted $2.96 billion in sales and $5.19 EPS ex items, topping views and prodding shares up nearly 4%. Thursday, Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) rose 5%, Celgene (CELG) 7% and Alexion (ALXN) 9% after beating on earnings. Amgen (AMGN) late Thursday beat, but shares tumbled nearly 10% Friday amid concerns about key drug Enbrel going forward. Also Friday, Novo Nordisk (NVO) dived 13% and Sanofi (SNY) rose 4.3%, as the European drugmakers had different views on the outlook for insulin treatments.Meanwhile, drug distributor McKesson (MCK) crashed 22.7% Friday after a big miss, blaming rival AmerisourceBergen (ABC) for heavy competition and further pressure from political attention on drug prices. AmerisourceBergen fell 13% and Cardinal Health (CAH) nearly 10%, with both reporting earnings next week.RELATED:Bristol-Myers, Celgene Stocks Rocket After Sweeping Q3 ExpectationsBiogen Q3 Tops; Alzheimer's Data Vs.

225,COP,"Alaska's oil reserves may have just gotten 80% bigger after Dallas-based Caelus Energy announced the discovery of 6 billion barrels under Arctic waters.The light-oil reserves were found in the company's Smith Bay leases between Prudhoe Bay and Barrow along the Arctic shore, according to a statement from Caelus on Tuesday. As much as 40% of the find, or 2.4 billion barrels, is estimated as recoverable, the company said. That compares with the state's proven reserves of 2.86 billion barrels in 2014, almost 8% of the U.S. total, Energy Department data show.""It's a really exciting discovery for us, and we think it's really exciting for the state of Alaska,"" Caelus CEO Jim Musselman said in a phone interview. ""They need a shot in the arm now.""Alaska's oil output has been gradually declining, to 483,000 barrels a day last year from a peak of more than 2 million barrels a day in 1988, Energy Department data show. The last major field brought on line was Alpine in 2000, which averaged 62,000 barrels a day in September, Alaska Department of Revenue data show.Musselman, the man who engineered the $3.2 billion sale of Triton Energy Ltd. to Hess (HES) in 2001, founded Caelus in 2011 to explore and develop petroleum resources on the North Slope. In 2014, the company formed a partnership with affiliates of Apollo Global Management to invest in oil and gas properties in Alaska.The development will cost between $8 billion and $10 billion over the life of the project, which could be brought into operation by the fall of 2022, Musselman said. Located about 125 miles from any other facilities, the company will need to build pipelines and roads. An oil price of about $65 a barrel and greater certainty on state tax policy and incentives is needed to develop the field, he said.""A lot of the investment decision is going to revolve around what happens within the state from a regulatory standpoint,"" he said.Caelus said its newly discovered field could produce as much as 200,000 barrels a day.The discovery of light oil was made after seismic data were collected and two wells were drilled this year, the company said. Another well will be drilled in early 2018, Casey Sullivan, a company spokesman, said in a phone interview. The discovery would be the biggest in four decades, the company said. Prudhoe Bay, the state's biggest field, was discovered in 1967.The fall in oil prices to a 12-year low of $26 a barrel in February from almost $108 a barrel in 2014 prompted companies including Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) and ConocoPhillips (COP) to withdraw from expensive and risky Arctic operations. Shell ended a nearly $8 billion quest to drill for crude in the Chukchi Sea after disappointing test well results. ConocoPhillips formally relinquished its 61 Chukchi Sea leases in April.The pretax cost to produce crude on the North Slope and transport it to market is about $40 a barrel on average, Sarah Erkmann, external affairs manager at the Alaska Oil and Gas Association, said in a phone interview. Oil futures closed at a three-month high of $49.83 a barrel on Wednesday in New York. They're still at less than half their peak level in 2014.Alaska North Slope oil production averaged about 475,000 barrels a day last month, down from roughly 494,000 a year earlier, according to Alaska Department of Revenue data.

228,COP,"Voters' top concerns are the stagnant economy and the threat of terrorism, but you wouldn't know it from Hillary Clinton's TV ads or campaign speeches. She's trying to twist the presidential race into a referendum on political correctness. Too embarrassed to run on her party's economic record or her failed stint as Secretary of State, she's positioning herself as top cop of the speech police.Hillary's running an ad of pre-teen girls looking self-consciously in the mirror, agonizing over their bodies. Sometimes such young girls' worries turn into deadly eating disorders, ultimately killing 10% of those affected. Clinton cynically exploits the pain and fear felt by thousands of families. Her ad uses a voiceover of Donald Trump saying things like ""she ate like a pig"" and ""does she have a fat {bleep}?""Parents struggling with their child's eating disorder run to one doctor after another frantically seeking answers. The causes are complex and still not entirely known, but no one believes the cause is Donald Trump. Some experts attribute part of the cause to Hollywood's glorification of skinny women. Instead of trying to muzzle Trump and other men, why isn't Hillary calling out her big supporters in the entertainment industry?The same question applies to Hillary's double standard, bashing Trump for lewdness but celebrating it in popular music. Clinton's latest super PAC ads condemn Trump's bawdy 2005 remarks on a bus with show biz ""journalist"" Billy Bush. Trump bragged to his buddy ""I moved on her like a bitch."" Clinton feigned outrage when she heard it, calling it ""horrific.""Manhattan Institute scholar Heather MacDonald chuckles at Clinton's hypocritical ""sudden onset of Victorian vapors.""After all, Clinton has no problem with the salaciouis lyrics of her pal and supporter Beyonce  Even when Beyonce sings: ""I came to slay bitch…When he fuck me good I take his ass to Red Lobster.""  Clinton says ""I want to be as good a president as Beyonce is a performer.""Trump can't catch a break with Clinton, even when he's trying to do the right thing. Another Clinton ad attacks Trump reaching out to inner-city African Americans with promises of more jobs and school choice. Reminding minority voters that Democratic politicians have failed to improve opportunity for them, Trump asks for their vote, saying ""What the hell do you have to lose?"" Clinton's ad says ""Everything.""It follows her ad featuring Ku Klux Klan members praising Trump.  It's McCarthyite guilt by association. Trump has no connection to the group. What's Trump actually guilt of? Poaching on Hillary's turf.Worse than tarring Trump, she's labeling cops, teachers, and millions of other Americans racists. Whenever she talks to black audiences, she stokes racial resentment.She told the NAACP that whites ""need to recognize our privilege and practice humility."" All whites, she claims, have ""implicit bias"" and she wants bias training for police and other professions. Implicit bias – you're told you have it, no matter how color-blind you try to be, and denying your bias just proves it.Implicit bias is p.c. drivel. There's no  solid data to support it, cautions social scientists Philip Tetlock of UPENN, Gregory Mitchell of the University of Virginia, and experts from New York University and the University of Connecticut.  But if Mrs. Clinton becomes President, we'll all be undergoing reeducation at school or work to cure our ""implicit bias.""To see what President Hillary's America would be like, look at most college campuses today. No one dares question Black Lives Matter, militant multiculturalism, and ""safe spaces"" to spare students from challenging ideas.Hillary's dictating how Americans talk about race, sex, even body shapes. Trump calls it like he sees it.He doesn't stick to the well-rehearsed rhetoric of a career politician. But his supporters are sick and tired of political correctness. He's not running for saint. He's running to get the job done, something Hillary Clinton has already proven she can't do.

But he doesn't any further dividend cuts after the company in February cut its payout for the first time in 25 years. Royal Dutch Shell's (RDSA) chief energy adviser Wim Thomas also told Reuters the oversupply may last until the end of next year.U.S. crude oil futures settled 1.4% lower at $46.98 per barrel.

Diamondback Energy was initiated at hold with a 105 price target, and Parsley Energy was started with a hold rating and 37 price target.Diamondback and Parsley focus on the Permian basin in West Texas, the epicenter of low-cost U.S. shale oil production. Earlier this month, Diamondback raised its full-year production guidance to 38,000-40,000 barrels per day from an earlier outlook of 34,000-38,000 barrels on increased activity in the second quarter in the Permian region.ConocoPhillips shares rose 0.1% to close at 42.35.

231,COP,"Oil prices jumped Thursday after the Energy Department announced the largest weekly crude stockpile draw since 1999, though it came as many refineries on the Gulf Coast were shut down during Hurricane Hermine and could soon be followed by a sharp rebound.The Energy Information Administration said crude stockpiles fell by 14.5 million barrels. Analysts were expecting an increase of 200,000 barrels.""The drop in crude stocks was caused by the decline in imports after the storm delayed ships going into Louisiana and Texas,"" James Williams, president of energy consultant WTRG Economics, told Reuters.""Next week, crude stocks will likely rise dramatically as those ships offload this week.""U.S. crude futures jumped 4.7% to settle at $47.62 per barrel.

Late last month, the EIA announced it would use ""near real-time"" export data from the Customs and Board Protection agency for its weekly statistics instead of estimating results from monthly export data from the Census Bureau.But the American Petroleum Institute, an industry group, also showed a big drop, saying late Wednesday that U.S. stockpiles fell by 12.1 million barrels.The inventory data come as some OPEC members push for a cap on oil production to help support prices.Phil Flynn, senior market analyst at the Price Futures Group, said he was ""99.9% sure we'll get a production freeze"" from top oil producers during the sidelines of the International Energy Forum in Algeria later this month.But not everyone shares Flynn's optimism for a deal. Morgan Stanley said last month that a production freeze among OPEC members was ""highly unlikely.""Goldman Sachs warned that neither a production freeze by OPEC nor a falling dollar would ""be sufficient to support prices much further.""But Flynn said a production freeze would send a signal ""to the street that there is going to be some kind of cop that will rein in production.""RELATED: Shale Gas 2.0: A Follow-On Boom In The U.S. Chemicals TradeApache To Spend Over A Fourth Of Budget On 'Immense' Permian Play

232,COP,"After the death of a young black man by a Milwaukee police officer, riots, looting and fires followed. In one instance, as a gas station burned, people watching chanted, ""Black power!""Local news reported that the 23-year-old suspect was not only armed but that he also defied orders to drop his gun. The Milwaukee police chief refused to identify the officer involved, but did say that he was ""black."" At one time, such a fact would suggest that racism and police brutality were not at play.But as the death of Freddie Gray -- a black man who died after being transported in a Baltimore police van -- shows us, not necessarily. Of the six officers involved in Gray's arrest and van transportation and who were prosecuted, three were black. In fact, just weeks before the death of Freddie Gray, a White House task force praised the Baltimore Police Department, as well as its black chief, for ""implementing national best practices for policies and training"" and ""use of force"" reforms.In Baltimore, at the time of Gray's death, the No. 1 and No. 2 heads of the Police Department were black, and most of the command staff and rank-and-file officers are people of color. The mayor of Baltimore is also black, as are the majority of city council and the state attorney who brought the charges. Four of six officers were tried, and in each case the state failed to obtain convictions. This led to the decision to drop charges against the remaining two officers, and plans for the retrial of one of the four. Zero for six.As to Milwaukee, a city with a population of approximately 600,000, it is 40% black and 37% non-Hispanic white. Yet of its 146 homicides last year, 84% of the victims were black -- and most of those were killed by other blacks. The nearly 150 murders constitute a 50% increase over the number of homicides just five years earlier.The point, of course, is that killers of blacks are overwhelmingly other blacks. At 13% of the population, blacks commit nearly half of the nation's homicides, and almost always the victim is black. Old people tend not to kill. Nor do women and the very young. This means 3% of the population, black men from 15 to 44 years old, commit nearly half of the country's homicides.The focus on the number of blacks killed by police kicked into high gear after the death of Ferguson's Michael Brown. Never mind Brown did not, as his friend at the scene initially told the police, have his hands up while supposedly telling the cop, ""Don't shoot."" Both the Ferguson grand jury and the U.S. Department of Justice found that many witnesses observed otherwise, and that forensic evidence showed that Brown charged the officer and attempted to wrestle the cop's gun away from him.Facts don't matter.It doesn't matter that over the past 47 years, according to the Centers for Disease Control, there has been an almost 75% decline in the number of blacks killed by cops. It doesn't matter that, compared with blacks, twice as many whites are killed by cops. It doesn't matter that, according to economist John Lott, black teens commit murder at nine times the rate of white teens. Cable news reporters seem oblivious to rates of offending. It's as if they believe that at 13% of the population, blacks should commit 13% of the crime -- or ""institutional racism"" must be at play. This is as silly as assuming that since non-Hispanic whites are 62% of the population, they should comprise 62% of the NBA.The reason the Democrats beat the drum of ""racism"" is simple -- votes. In the case of the media, it must be ratings. But it's also something else. Our major media are run by large corporations: What's the upside for them in criticizing those who believe that racism remains a major problem in America? Telling blacks to calm down, examine the facts, that they are not victims, that racism is no longer a major problem in America and that the real problem is the breakdown of the black family -- this is not a recipe for profits. It is an invitation for protests by ""activists.""

Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) is on tap for Wednesday, and analysts see its EPS tumbling 62% to 47 cents and revenue falling 57% to $31.2 billion.Exxon and Chevron will announce results Friday. Analysts expect Exxon's EPS to fall 36% to 64 cents and revenue to be down 12% to $60.6 billion.After slashing expenditures for nearly two years, companies appear more comfortable spending as the market outlook improves. Exxon announced Thursday that it will buy InterOil (IOC) for over $2.5 billion, beating out Total (TOT)-backed Oil Search for the natural gas producer.Meanwhile, Chevron's EPS is seen plunging nearly 64% to 32 cents, with revenue to falling 36% to $25.8 billion.IBD'S TAKE: Chevron and Shell shares are in buy range, with Exxon heading towards profit-taking range as activity in the U.S. is likely recovering from the bottom.ConocoPhillips (COP), no longer an integrated oil company since it spun off its refining operations, will report Thursday. Analysts see it posting a loss of 59 cents per share and a 38% drop in revenue to $5.38 billion. ConocoPhillips said Thursday it would lay off 1,000 more employees this year at its U.S. and Canada operations. The company had already laid off thousand of workers last year.But the pain might finally be over for oil companies, as the market has shown signs of bottoming. The Energy Information Administration said Wednesday that U.S. production rose by 0.1% to 8.49 million barrels in the latest week, the third straight increase.Rig counts hit a bottom during the second quarter and are now on the uptick, rising last week by 15 to 462, according to Baker Hughes (BHI). That marks the fourth straight rise and the seventh gain out of the last eight weeks.

234,COP,"A new study by a Harvard economist, who happens to be black, finds cops less likely to use deadly force on black suspects vs. white.Angered by the deaths of Freddie Gray and Michael Brown, black men in Baltimore, Maryland, and Ferguson, Missouri, respectively, who died at the hands of the police, professor Roland Fryer Jr. said, ""You know, protesting is not my thing. But data is my thing.""So he sought to answer the question. Do the police, in fact, use lethal force against black suspects more than they do against whites?Fryer examined 1,332 police shootings -- including fatal and nonfatal shootings -- in the police departments of 10 large cities in Texas, California and Florida. He said his findings surprised him. In an article about the study, The New York Times wrote:""In shootings in these 10 cities involving officers, officers were more likely to fire their weapons without having first been attacked when the suspects were white. Black and white civilians involved in police shootings were equally likely to have been carrying a weapon. Both results undercut the idea of racial bias in police use of lethal force.""But the question remained, when the suspect is black, are officers more likely to use deadly force? The Times wrote:""What about situations in which an officer might be expected to fire, but doesn't? To answer this, Mr. Fryer focused on one city, Houston. The police department there let the researchers look at reports not only for shootings but also for arrests when lethal force might have been justified. Mr. Fryer defined this group to include encounters with suspects the police subsequently charged with serious offenses like attempting to murder an officer, or evading or resisting arrest. He also considered suspects shocked with Tasers.""Mr. Fryer found that in such situations, officers in Houston were about 20% less likely to shoot if the suspects were black. This estimate was not precise, and firmer conclusions would require more data. But in various models controlling for different factors and using different definitions of tense situations, Mr. Fryer found that blacks were either less likely to be shot or there was no difference between blacks and whites.""Yes, the study found cops were more likely to put their hands on a black suspect vs. a white suspect -- also to cuff, push to the ground or pepper-spray -- but probably because cops don't want the encounter to escalate to a shooting. This use-of-deadly-force study proves that Black Lives Matter, Obama's sympathy with the group and media's obsession with white-cop-black-suspect stories are built on lies. And Fryer's study confirms similar findings in ""The Reverse Racism Effect,"" a study by researchers at Washington State University.Recall actor Jesse Williams, who in a rant during a BET awards ceremony said, ""What we've been doing is looking at the data and we know that police somehow manage to de-escalate, disarm and not kill white people everyday."" Will Mr. Williams now man up and apologize for helping to perpetuate this phony narrative that cops are out to get blacks? Will Time magazine -- one among many media outlets that slobbered over Jesse Williams' rant -- apologize for calling it ""powerful""?After the shooting deaths of black suspects at the hands of the police in Minnesota and Louisiana, Hillary Clinton said, ""White people ... have to start listening to the legitimate cries"" of black people. This is the usual kind of condescending pap we always hear from Democrats. But in their case, the reason is votes. In order for the Democratic Party to maintain the 95% monolithic hold they have with black voters, they need to create scenarios of anger and fear against so-called ""structural"" or ""institutional"" or ""systemic"" racism. We know their motive.As to the media, one can only conclude that it's about ratings. When a black officer shoots a black suspect, it does not generate the same level of outrage as when a white officer shoots a black suspect, especially when he is unarmed. But of the nearly 1,000 people killed by cops last year -- according The Washington Post's own tally -- the Post reported that less than 4% were instances of white cops shooting and killing an unarmed black man.And there's this. What's hard about complying with a cop's order so you don't get shot? There is no right to defy a lawful order. That a cop may be rude does not make an order any less lawful. Hillary Clinton, showing how she feels blacks' pain, says black parents tell her that they have what is called ""the talk"" with their children on how to comport themselves when engaged in an encounter with the police. But in almost every recent case of an officer shooting a black person, the black person resisted arrest. So much for ""the talk.""How about, ""Comply -- you won't die""?

235,COP,"Race Relations: Just hours after President Obama blasted cops for targeting blacks in the wake of two police-involved shooting deaths and said ""change has been too slow,"" five officers were killed by sniper fire at a Black Lives Matter rally.On a Facebook posting that Obama put up around 3 p.m. EDT Thursday, he lamented that recent fatal shootings in Louisiana and Minnesota ""are not isolated incidents.""Obama wrote that ""they are symptomatic of the broader challenges within our criminal justice system, the racial disparities that appear across the system year after year.""At 6:45 that evening, he gave a speech from Poland, to reiterate these points. ""When we see data that indicates disparities in how African Americans and Latinos may be treated in various jurisdictions around the country, then it's incumbent on all of us to say, we can do better than this.""Obama complained that ""change has been too slow and we have to have a greater sense of urgency about this.""Just before 8 p.m. EDT, the sniper fire struck police in Dallas at a Black Lives Matter rally, which was being held to protest the two killings Obama was talking about. Five cops were killed and seven wounded in the attack -- one of the murders caught on videotape was at point-blank range.After these killings, Obama offered no new Facebook posting. He didn't give another speech. He just issued a short statement condemning the ""vicious, calculated and despicable attack on law enforcement.""The lack of balance is shocking, but it is in keeping with Obama's approach to law enforcement since entering the White House. At every opportunity, he's taken pains to foment public anger when a cop kills a black person -- often long before the facts are known -- while issuing little more than terse statements when police are targeted by killers.After a Ferguson police officer killed Michael Brown, Obama scolded the officer -- saying there was ""no excuse"" for the shooting -- and sicced then-Attorney General Eric Holder on the Ferguson Police Department looking for evidence of racism. When the facts came out, they supported the officer's story that he acted in self-defense.After a Baltimore drug dealer died in police custody, Obama rushed in to complain about how ""we have seen too many instances of what appears to be police officers interacting with individuals, primarily African-American, often poor, in ways that raise troubling questions,"" Obama said. ""This has been a slow-rolling crisis. This has been going on for a long time. This is not new, and we shouldn't pretend that it's new.""As with Ferguson, the facts ended up supported the police -- every one put on trial so far has since been exonerated.Last year in this space, we noted that ""while Obama hasn't called outright for hostilities against police, he helped craft Black Lives Matter's false narrative that racist white cops kill innocent blacks all the time. And like Black Lives Matter, he has fueled anti-cop hatred with anti-cop rhetoric.""So is Obama to blame for the Dallas killings? No, not directly. Only the murderer who pulled a trigger, along with those who might have helped plan and execute the attack, are to blame.But by the standards of responsibility constantly being propagated by the left -- who tried to pin Rep. Gabby Giffords' shooting on Sarah Palin and the terrorist attack at a gay nightclub in Florida on Christian conservatives -- he shares in the blame.Rather than call for calm and racial healing, Obama's rhetoric has only served to inflame animosity, fuel anger and, arguably, help justify those extremists who believe that, like Obama, ""change has been too slow.""After almost eight years in office, Obama still acts like he's Community Organizer of the United States.

236,COP,"It was a huge week for earnings. Apple (AAPL), Facebook (FB), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Amazon (AMZN) all beat forecasts, while McDonald's (MCD) and Ford Motor (F) indicated some weakness in U.S. demand. Tech M&A stepped up, including a Verizon (VZ) deal to buy Yahoo's (YHOO) core assets. The U.S. economy is growing a lot slower than expected, and oil prices are nearing $40 a barrel.The Nasdaq composite rose 1.2% to its best levels since early December, fueled by strong earnings from Apple, Facebook, Alphabet and Amazon. The S&P 500 hitting a new record high Friday but closed the week down fractionally. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.7%, also snapping a four-week uptrend, as weaker oil prices and earnings reports hit the energy sector. The Federal Reserve's statement that the ""near-term economic risks"" have ""diminished"" seemed to have little impact on investors.The iPhone maker earned $1.42 a share, down 23% year over year, on sales of $42.4 billion, down 15%. It was Apple's second straight declines in earnings, revenue and iPhone sales -- but they were still better than expected. Apple's current-quarter revenue target is $46.5 billion at the midpoint, off 10% but above Wall Street consensus of $45.71 billion. The iPhone 7 is expected to be released in mid-September.Apple stock rose 5.6% for the week, just retaking its 200-day line.Amazon Q2 EPS of $1.78 shattered the estimate of $1.11. Revenue rose 30% to 30.4 billion. Amazon Web Services continued to boom. Revenue guidance for Q3 also was strong, though operating income may be light.Amazon stock rose 1.9% to 758.81 for the week, hitting a record 766 intraday Friday.IBD'S TAKE: Amazon is a Leaderboard stock, hitting new highs as growth booms. But it's only rated No. 4 in IBD's Retail-Internet group. To see who's No. 1, go to IBD Stock Checkup. Facebook reported Q2 revenue of $6.43 billion, up 59% and maintaining a streak of double-digit growth going back more than four years. EPS jumped 94% to 97 cents, shattering consensus for 82 cents. It was the fourth straight quarter of accelerating earnings growth. Facebook stock rose 2.4% to 123.94, hitting a record high and still within range of a 121.18 buy point.Twitter (TWTR) reported Q2 EPS that topped views. But revenue fell short, and Q3 revenue guidance also missed estimates. Twitter stock fell 9.4% but closed the week above its 50-day line.Bouncing back from a Q1 miss, Alphabet reported Q2 EPS and revenue that blew past expectations. The Google parent's earnings minus items rose 20% to $8.42 a share. Total revenue climbed 21% to $21.5 billion. Despite Google's size, it's still delivering growth, says Mark Mahaney, analyst at RBC Capital. ""This is now the 18th straight quarter of 20%-ish year-over-year revenue growth, and did we mention acceleration?"" he said in a report.Alphabet stock rose 4.2% to 791.34, closing just above a 791.05 entry point after rising as high as 803.94.Ford Motor sent a signal that the long auto industry bull market is over, as U.S. auto sales stall, and higher incentives hit profit margins. The No. 2 U.S. automaker's Q2 earnings per share and revenue rose, but EPS growth was weakest in five quarters, sales growth was the slimmest in three quarters, and Ford cited ""downside risk to global growth."" Offering further evidence of slowing, auto parts maker Lear (LEA) missed on sales and warned on 2016 revenue, while Gentherm (THRM) earnings missed. Volkswagen (VLKAY) Q2 sales edged up 1.7%, but its net profit plunged 57% vs. a year early as it struggled to recover from an emissions test cheating scandal involving diesel-engine models.Ford stock fell 8.5%.The Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged after its two-day policy meeting, as expected. Policymakers said ""near-term economic risks ... have diminished,"" suggesting a baby step to raising rates, and some analysts said it opened the door, slightly, to a September rate increase. But after the Fed meeting and weak GDP data, investors pushed back their expectations for the next hike beyond the next 12 months.The U.S. economy rose at a 1.2% annual rate in Q2, less than half of what Wall Street expected, after Q1's downwardly revised 0.8% pace. Consumer spending was very strong, climbing 4.2%.But residential investment fell, even as separate reports show new- and existing-home sales hitting multiyear highs. Business investment contracted for a third straight quarter. With oil prices falling back toward $40 a barrel, corporate spending may remain weak going forward.U.S. crude oil futures tumbled 5.9% to $41.60 a barrel, hitting three-month lows as the crude tumbled 13.9% for July. U.S. crude and gasoline supplies rose again, according to the Energy Information Administration, which also reported higher U.S. production. The number of U.S. oil rigs in operation rose for a fifth straight week, suggesting further production gains. But a glut of gasoline and refined products, suggesting less refinery demand for crude ahead. Meanwhile, Exxon Mobil (XOM), Chevron (CVX) and ConocoPhillips (COP) reported weaker-than-expected results.Mobileye (MBLY) reported Q2 EPS jumped 70% to 17 cents, while revenue grew 51% to $83.5 million. Both topped views. The maker of driver-assistance systems said that its relationship with Tesla Motors (TSLA) is ending. That news sent Mobileye down 8% on Tuesday, but the stock pared losses for the week to 3.4%. Tesla rose 5.6%.Boeing (BA) reported its first quarterly loss in years due to various charges, but it wasn't as deep as feared. Free cash flow was better than expected on big jet deliveries. Northrop Grumman (NOC) reported modest earnings and sales growth that topped views, but weaker tech services revenue hurt margins. Raytheon (RTN) beat views and raised profit guidance. General Dynamics (GD) topped on earnings and raised EPS guidance, but Q2 revenue missed.McDonald's earned $1.45 a share, beating analysts' expectations for $1.38. Total revenue fell 3.6% vs. a year earlier to $6.265 billion. Analysts had expected $6.27 billion. Global same-store sales, excluding currency effects, rose 3.1% vs. estimates for about 3.6%. U.S. same-store sales rose just 1.8%. Management said they were ""not immune"" to consumer unease -- be it over finances, the election or, in general, ""an unsettled world"" -- that may have hurt other restaurants during the quarter.Shares fell 8.3% to 117.60 for the week, tumbling through their 50-day and 200-day moving averages -- and a 124.18 buy point.Stifel Nicolaus downgraded a large number of restaurant stocks, while Jefferies predicted a U.S. recession would hit the sector. Top-rated Texas Roadhouse (TXRH), which reports earnings in the coming week, fell 6% on Wednesday. But the steakhouse chain found support at its 50-day line and closed the week down 2.3%.United Technologies (UTX), maker of Pratt & Whitney brand aircraft engines, Otis elevators and other products, reported second-quarter earnings per share and revenue that beat estimates and raised its Q3 EPS estimate. Its stock hit a one-year high at 108.49, above a 107.07 buy point. Caterpillar's (CAT) Q2 EPS and revenue both fell as the mining and construction equipment giant deals with an energy and mining downturn. Its stock hit a roughly one-year high at 84.29, rising above an 80.89 entry point. Chemicals giant DuPont (DD), which is merging with Dow Chemical (DOW), crushed earnings estimates but was light on revenue. Shares rose to 69.87, the highest point since mid-December, triggering its 69.50 buy point. Meanwhile 3M (MMM), which makes tapes, adhesives, medical supplies and other products, also reported higher EPS and lower revenue, beating estimates on both. But its shares fell 1.1%.Analog Devices (ADI) agreed to buy Linear Technology (LLTC) in a cash-and-stock deal worth around $14.8 billion to create a microchip-industry giant. The deal is expected to close within the first half of 2017. Meanwhile, Oracle (ORCL) said it would buy cloud-services provider NetSuite (N) in a $9.3 billion deal. Oracle's Larry Ellison is the leading shareholder of NetSuite. Meanwhile, Citrix Systems (CTXS) will merge its Go To Meeting unit with LogMeIn (LOGM). Citrix was already planning to spin off Go To Meeting.Verizon Communications acquired struggling the core assets of Yahoo for nearly $6 billion, including $1.1 billion in stock compensation costs. ""Despite the massive execution challenges ahead, the Yahoo acquisition demonstrates that Verizon recognizes its own limitations as a consumer brand,"" said research firm The Diffusion Group. Verizon reported Q2 revenue that missed views and in-line EPS, and added fewer wireless postpaid phone subscribers than expected.T-Mobile US (TMUS) in Q2 added 646,000 postpaid phone subscribers, topping Sprint (S) at 173,000 and Verizon's 86,000. AT&T (T) lost 160,000 postpaid phone subscribers. T-Mobile's earnings fell 40% but still beat expectations. Revenue rose nearly 13% to $9.2 billion. ""TMUS revenue growth continues to significantly outpace peers,"" said Matthew Niknam, a Deutsche Bank analyst, in a report.Under Armour (UA) met top-line and bottom-line expectations when it reported per-share earnings of a penny, down 75% from the prior-year Q2, and 28% revenue growth to $1 billion. The Nike (NKE) rival announced several assertive plans, including its takeover of the FAO Schwarz space in Manhattan, as well as a partnership with Kohl's (KSS). But shares tumbled 7.9% for the week.Amgen (AMGN) beat and raised, but its stock slipped as its growth continued to be driven by price increases rather than volume. Celgene (CELG), meanwhile, jumped as only a third of its growth was price-driven, making up for a hit earlier in the week when its drug Revlimid failed a lymphoma trial. AbbVie (ABBV), Merck (MRK) and Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) also rose on solid reports. AstraZeneca (AZN) was the biggest winner stock-wise when it jumped 9% Thursday on rumors that Swiss pharma Novartis (NVS) was thinking of acquiring it. The biggest loser was Gilead Sciences (GILD), which trimmed its guidance as its hepatitis C franchise continued to decline.Meanwhile, top-rated medical device companies Edwards Lifesciences (EW) and orthopedics giant Zimmer Biomet (ZBH) each hit new highs after beating estimates and raising guidance. Big Cap 20 stalwart Boston Scientific (BSX) hit a 10-year high after it reported its strongest quarter of sales growth in nearly a decade.

237,COP,"When you need something done, call a retired cop.That's how Blue Light Friday at the White House came together last week. Unlike the lame duck occupant at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave., I have little experience as a community organizer. So I asked retired New York Police Department officer John Cardillo if he could help me turn out his law enforcement friends, families and supporters to honor the fallen.His one-word answer: ""Yes.""Our mission: Bring a blue hue to the People's House in Washington, D.C. -- in the wake of the Dallas and Baton Rouge police ambushes -- since Barack Obama refused to do it himself. Obama spurned the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association Foundation's request to make the small, but meaningful, gesture of turning the floodlights blue the same way he turned them rainbow for gay marriage or pink for breast cancer awareness.Ordering the rest of the country to lower its flags to half-staff for five days was enough, his administration diffidently told reporters.We did not agree.As Cardillo told me: ""Watching Barack Obama invite those who celebrate cop killers Mumia Abu Jamal and Joanne Chesimard to the White House, and giving the benefit of doubt in police-involved shootings to the career criminals over the career law enforcement officers, compelled me to do something other than rant on air and social media.""Our friend Cameron Gray of NRA News helped spread the word. My colleagues at Conservative Review assisted with logistics and social media coverage. Cardillo also summoned retired NYPD detective, Rob O'Donnell, who is an administrator and assists the board of the nonprofit charity Brothers Before Others, which supports the LEO community.""As a law enforcement professional for 25 years working with communities of all backgrounds, I can conclude one thing: All lives matter! Always have, always will,"" O'Donnell told me. ""Be it a 911 call, or a peaceful protest, police of all backgrounds do what they were trained to do: run to the gunfire for all, regardless of color or creed.""That's what fallen officers Brent Thompson, Patrick Zamarripa, Michael Krol, Michael Smith, and Lorne Ahrens did in Dallas. And what fallen officers Montrell Jackson, Matthew Gerald and Brad Garafola did in Baton Rouge. And what fallen officers Wenjian Liu and Rafael Ramos were sworn to do in Brooklyn. ""Same as September 11th, same as Orlando, same as New Orleans, same as every street of every community in every town,"" O'Donnell reminded us.We stopped by the nearby National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial, which features more than 20,000 names of officers killed in the line of duty dating back to 1791, before our vigil. At Lafayette Park, we passed out blue glow sticks and flashlights to a crowd of about 50 people who gathered to take part. Several active-duty LEOs stopped by after work and stood with us, too. A bagpipe player who works at a local fire department led our procession.Gray noted: ""Members of a certain Service that is known for being Secret even quietly thanked some of us, and one said it was hard not to applaud.""A crowd of young Black Lives Matters demonstrators approached, and then retreated without engaging us. Maybe they were allergic to the beautiful sound of ""God Bless America"" resonating from bagpipes. NBC News and Associated Press photographers snapped pictures and video (but perhaps since no American flags were burned or angry fists were raised, none of the images they captured has appeared to have made it on air or in print.)No matter. As the sun sank, our little blue lights twinkled in the dusk and we talked to curious tourists about rising anti-cop rhetoric and violence that doesn't make front-page headlines. Many passers-by draped glow sticks around their necks or promised to turn a light blue on their front porches when they got home.Cardillo is already working on another event in his adopted home state: ""Our #BlueLightFriday gathering in front of the White House is something I hope catches on nationally. I'm optimistic as I'm already planning another for south Florida in partnership with local law enforcement.""Indeed, many families have already taken upon themselves to create their own porch-light memorials and share them online. One Lowe's home improvement store is now selling designated blue bulbs and encouraging customers to ""light up the sky blue"" in August for the men and women on the front lines.It couldn't come at a better time. This week, Hillary Clinton and the Democratic National Convention are giving prime-time speaking slots to agitators of the Black Lives Matters movement, which has stoked virulent cop hatred without accountability for its bloodthirsty ""pigs in a blanket, fry 'em up like bacon"" rhetoric.As Philadelphia's own Fraternal Order of Police noted: ""It is sad that to win an election Mrs. Clinton must pander to the interests of people who do not know all the facts, while the men and women they seek to destroy are outside protecting the political institutions of this country.""Teach your children that small gestures matter. Change the culture, one little blue light at a time.

240,COP,"The fascinating thing about Hillary Clinton's lie that ""African-Americans"" are disproportionately killed by police is that she continues peddling it after the murders of three law enforcement officers in Baton Rouge, which followed the ambush killings of five officers in Dallas.In both cases, the murderers were black men apparently convinced that the cops were out to get black people and who, therefore, sought to exact revenge.President Barack Obama, too, talks about the ""disparity"" that blacks, compared to whites, are more likely to be killed by the police. That Obama -- in lecturing about this so-called disparity -- gets away with ignoring the disproportionate rate at which blacks, especially young blacks, commit violent crime is truly astonishing.Should blacks, at 13% of the population, comprise 13%  of doctors, 13 percent of lawyers and 13% of NBA players? If not, does this mean there is a ""disparity"" that we must address as a society?According to economist John Lott, teenage black males, compared to teen white males, are nine times more likely to commit murder -- and the murder victim is almost always another young black man. What about that disparity, Mr. President?It's also interesting to watch the reaction of those who believe Clinton and defend her position, even when they are confronted with the facts. Talk about -- pardon the pun -- shooting the messenger. When I told someone that, according to The Washington Post, of the 965 blacks killed by cops last year, less than 4% involved a white cop and unarmed black man, he sniffed, ""Why should a cop kill anyone  who is unarmed?""Well, take the case for Michael Brown, arguably the white police-black suspect encounter that launched the Black Lives Matter movement and its mantra, ""Hands Up, Don't Shoot."" Eyewitness testimony and physical evidence show that Brown charged the police officer and attempted to get the cop's gun. Unarmed does not mean non-threatening.It's hard to believe that two Ivy League-educated lawyers, Obama and Clinton, do not understand things like statistics, ratios and how to properly interpret crime data to incorporate the rate at which crime is committed by young black men versus the rate at which crime is committed by young white men.As Heather Mac Donald of the Manhattan Institute writes in The Wall Street Journal, ""According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, blacks were charged with 62% of all robberies, 57% of murders and 45% of assaults in the 75 largest U.S. counties in 2009, though they made up roughly 15% of the population there.""This leads us to but one conclusion: Obama and Clinton are flat-out lying. The goal is obvious -- to retain that monolithic black vote, without which Democrats cannot win at the presidential level.Obama cannot brag about -- and Clinton cannot run on -- his economic record for blacks. Under his watch, black poverty is up. Net worth is down. The ""wealth gap"" between blacks and whites is at a 25-year high. And as to the employment of black men, their ""labor force participation rate"" (the percentage of those 20 years of age and over who are either working or looking for work) hit its lowest rate in December 2013 -- well into Obama's second term and his economic ""recovery.""That low was the worst since 1972, when the Bureau of Labor Statistics began keeping such records. And since December 2010, black men's employment rate every single month to date  has seen lower numbers than any month under all other presidents dating back to 1972.So, what to do? Change the subject, of course. Make the election about ""social justice."" Prattle on about what Clinton calls the ""school-to-prison pipeline."" Never mind that this drive to induce paranoia among blacks has real-world consequences.As mentioned, already it has helped inspire murderers to kill officers in Dallas and Baton Rouge. But it also causes police officers to be less proactive, fearing that they, too, will be accused of unfairly ""profiling"" blacks. Cops pull back. This police passivity means crime increases, the victims of which are disproportionately black, the very people Ms. Clinton claims to care so deeply about.Lies get votes. But they also get people killed.
"
241,COP,"Cleveland, which has thousands of Republicans, protestors and police converging in its congested downtown area, is especially on edge after the killing of police officers in Baton Rouge on Sunday morning. President Obama's remarks later that day didn't particularly help.Hours after three Baton Rouge police officers had been killed, and two others injured and one was clinging to life, Obama took to the podium in the White House to decry the attacks.""Nothing justifies violence against law enforcement,"" he said. ""Attacks on police are an attack on all of us and the rule of law that makes society possible.""So far so good. But then Obama went on to blame ""inflammatory rhetoric"" and ""careless accusations thrown around to score political points or to advance an agenda,"" and complained that ""around-the-clock new cycles and social media (that) sometimes amplify these divisions,"" as do ""political conventions.""The mainstream press, all gathered in Cleveland for the Republican National Convention, took Obama's cue and started blathering on about how the GOP needs to tone down its rhetoric.But it's not generic political rhetoric -- and most emphatically not Donald Trump's rhetoric -- that has fueled the spate of cop shootings. It is specifically anti-cop rhetoric, which has sought to portray police officers as inveterate racists who are randomly and wantonly killing innocent black people.And it is this rhetoric that Obama himself has been aiding and abetting for years.That started almost as soon as Obama got into the White House, when he blasted a white police officer for arresting Harvard University professor Henry Louis Gates, saying the cop ""acted stupidly.""When Michael Brown was shot, Obama said his death ""stains the heart of black children.""Freddie Grey's death while in police custody was another sign of racism, Obama complained, saying ""this is not new, and we shouldn't pretend it's new.""And just hours before five officers were killed in Dallas, Obama was once again stoking racial animosity, saying that the deaths of two blacks at the hands of police in Louisiana and Minnesota were ""symptomatic of the broader challenges within our criminal justice system, the racial disparities that appear across the system year after year.""Even at the memorial in Dallas, Obama tried to blame budget cuts for racial tensions between African Americans and the police.The police have been warning Obama for some time now that his divisive rhetoric was creating new risks for officers.After a Houston cop was ambushed in August 2015, Ronald Hoski, complained that ""I don't see and hear from the president when a cop gets shot and killed.""Last September, Jerry Flynn of the New England Police Benevolent Association said that ""Our members are enraged at (Obama's) lack of support of law enforcement. It's clear that he has an agenda and unfortunately, the police are not part of his agenda.""After the Baton Rouge shootings, Cleveland Police Detective Steve Loomis blasted Obama for refusing to specifically attack the anti-cop rhetoric spewing from groups like Black Lives Matter.""Now, we see an escalation. This has got to end,"" Loomis said. ""The president of the United States has blood on his hands and it will not be able to become washed off.""That's a bit harsh. But Obama needs to do more than decry police shootings, while coddling or rationalizing those who are egging the shooters on and pretending that everyone else is to blame.

242,COP,"It was very appropriate that on Friday, the day after the massacre of five Dallas police officers, the New York Times devoted nearly the whole top half of its front page to four enormous photos of the death of Philando Castile, a black motorist killed by a Minnesota police officer.Of course, the paper was printed before the Dallas murders; and even the New York Times might not have so prominently featured the Minnesota killing on its front page had the Dallas murders occurred a few hours earlier.Nevertheless, it was completely appropriate. The New York Times has been in the forefront of the left's hysterical, hate-filled attacks on police officers and whites.Also appropriately, on the day of the Dallas murders, the Times published two white-hating, police-hating pieces.One was by Michael Eric Dyson, a radical black professor of sociology at Georgetown University.The Dyson column is nothing more than a racist hit piece on ""white America.""An example:""At birth, (whites) are given a pair of binoculars. ... Those binoculars are privilege; they are status, regardless of your class. In fact the greatest privilege that exists is for white folk to get stopped by a cop and not end up dead when the encounter is over.""Dyson wrote these words based on the police killings of two blacks last week, about which he knows nothing except the narrative of the (left-wing) media and what he has seen on some grainy phone videos.And not once does Professor Dyson mention that the Minnesota police officer was Latino. Why would he? That would suggest that Latinos, too, are given racist binoculars at birth. But Dyson would never say so, because it is white America he loathes.Nor does he note, or perhaps even know -- because of his left-wing binoculars -- facts such as these:In 2015, of the 990 people shot dead by police, 93 were unarmed and 38 of them were black. Of the 505 people shot dead by police thus far in 2016, 37 were unarmed and of them 13 were black. Given that blacks murder and rob more than whites -- they committed 62% of robberies, 57% of murders and 45% of assaults in the 75 biggest counties in the country in 2009 (despite comprising about 15% of the population in these counties) -- an unarmed black is less likely to be killed by police than an unarmed white. (Data from the Washington Post.)Does Dyson, a professor of sociology, not know these statistics? Does he not know that, statistically, whites have more reason to fear being murdered by a black than vice versa? If he doesn't, he shouldn't be teaching sociology. If he does, students should be aware that he is a left-wing, black nationalist propagandist, not a teacher.The same day the Times published Dyson's piece, it published a second anti-white, anti-cop, hate-America piece by the mother of Michael Brown, the young black man killed in Ferguson, Mo. That black grand jurors and even Obama's Department of Justice found the policeman who killed Brown was acting in self-defense after being attacked and thus justified him in doing so means nothing to the New York Times. So it published the grieving mother's anti-cop hate.The blacks and whites of the left have led much of America, especially black America, to believe that cops are generally racist, that there is ""systemic"" racism and that whites are privileged and racist. It's all a lie that has had -- and will continue to have -- murderous consequences.America has become the least racist multiracial, multiethnic country in world history. This drives the America-hating left crazy. That's why leftists manufacture fantasies like ""microaggressions"" -- nonracist statements that the left labels racist, foolishness like ""white privilege"" and the dangerous rhetoric of ""Blacks Lives Matter.""Just yesterday the New York Times published the results of a study conducted by a black Harvard professor of economics that shows that ""when it comes to the most lethal form of force -- police shootings -- the study finds no racial bias.""""It is the most surprising result of my career,"" said Roland G. Fryer Jr., the author of the study.One assumes that this Harvard professor has never read Heather Mac Donald or any other conservatives who have been writing this for years.The New York Times -- as the flagship publication of the left -- and the rest of the left have the blood of police on their hands. And not just cops' blood -- the blood of the blacks murdered because of police reticence to vigorously patrol black areas. What is known as the ""Ferguson effect"" was created entirely by the left.
"
243,COP,"President Barack Obama and his first attorney general, Eric Holder, called for an honest conversation about race. Holder even called us ""a nation of cowards"" because we were unwilling to have a ""national conversation"" about race. The truth of the matter is there's been more than a half-century of conversations about race. We do not need more. Instead, black people need to have frank conversations among ourselves, no matter how uncomfortable and embarrassing the topics may be.Among the nation's most dangerous cities are Detroit, Chicago, St. Louis, Baltimore, Memphis, Milwaukee, Birmingham, Newark, Cleveland and Philadelphia. These once-thriving cities are in steep decline. What these cities have in common is that they have large black populations. Also, they have been run by Democrats for nearly a half-century, with blacks having significant political power. Other characteristics these cities share are poorly performing and unsafe schools, poor-quality city services and declining populations.Each year, more than 7,000 blacks are murdered. That's a number greater than white and Hispanic murder victims combined. Blacks of all ages are killed at six times the rate of whites and Hispanics combined. According to the FBI, the police kill about 400 people a year; blacks are roughly one-third of that number. In Chicago alone, so far this year, over 2,000 people have been shot, leaving over 320 dead. It's a similar tale of mayhem in other predominantly black cities.Heather Mac Donald's most recent book, ""The War on Cops,"" points out some devastating and sobering statistics: ""Blacks were charged with 62% of all robberies, 57% of all murders, and 45% of all assaults in the 75 largest U.S. counties in 2009, while constituting roughly 15% of the population in those counties. From 2005 to 2014, 40% of cop-killers were black. Given the racially lopsided nature of gun violence, a 26% rate of black victimization by the police is not evidence of bias.""The primary victims of lawlessness are black people. To address this problem and most others, black people should ignore the liberal agenda. If civil authorities will not do their job of creating a safe environment, then black people should take the initiative. One example comes to mind. In 1988, at the request of residents, Black Muslims began to patrol Mayfair Mansions, a drug-infested, gang-ridden, unsafe Washington, D.C., housing project. The gangs and drug lords left. The Nation of Islam sentinels were not deterred by the wishes of politicians and the American Civil Liberties Union. They didn't feel obliged to give kid glove treatment to criminals. Black residents of crime-infested neighborhoods should set up patrols, armed if necessary, to challenge thugs, gangs, drug dealers and other miscreants and make black neighborhoods safe and respectable. No one should have to live in daily fear for his life and safety. Most Americans have no idea of -- and wouldn't begin to tolerate -- the climate of fear and intimidation under which so many black people live.Without self-initiative, there is not much that can be done about the high crime rate in black neighborhoods. Black and white liberals and their allies in the ACLU, as well as many libertarians, will not countenance the kind of tools needed to bring about civility. For example, the Chicago Police Department recently entered an agreement with the ACLU to record contact cards for all street stops. The ACLU claimed that police were disproportionately targeting minorities for questioning and searches. The practical result will be fewer investigative stops by police and more crime, and it will be black residents who suffer.Black people have the capacity to run the criminals out of their neighborhoods. Let me put the issue another way. Suppose it were the Ku Klux Klan riding through black neighborhoods murdering 7,000 blacks year after year. How many black people would be willing to wait for the Klansmen to behave themselves or accept political promises and wait for a government program?
"
244,COP,"Law Enforcement: If tragedy is supposed to reveal a person's ability to lead, both President Obama and his would-be successor, Hillary Clinton, failed miserably in the wake of the slaughter of five police officers in Dallas.After vilifying cops for being racist just hours before the Dallas shootings began, Obama on Sunday turned around warned against ""those of us who ... attack police officers.""But the reason he gave is that these attacks ""are doing a disservice to the cause"" of criminal justice reform. In other words, attacking the police as racist will make it harder for him and his fellow Democrats to root out all those racist cops.That's not exactly a ringing endorsement of those who put their lives on the line every day to maintain law and order.While Obama is certain that racism is behind police shootings of black people — a claim that a new study debunks — he pleads ignorance about why Micah Xavier Johnson carried out his murderous rampage.""I think it's very hard to untangle the motives of this shooter,"" he said on Saturday. Apparently, motives are only clear when they fit Obama's political narrative.The police have had enough, and at long last are starting to blast Obama's rhetoric. ""We need (a president) who works to unify the United States,"" said Jim Pasco, executive director of the Fraternal Order of Police.William Johnson, executive director of the National Association of Police Organizations was far less diplomatic, saying Obama ""has contributed to a climate where these things can happen. This president and his administration absolutely do not have our back and make our jobs more dangerous.""If Obama's response was bad, Clinton's was even worse.On CNN Friday, Clinton essentially blamed the police for the fact that five of them were killed the day before because blacks feel as if they have to ""protect themselves"" from the police.Later that same day, Clinton followed up her un-presidential vilification of the police by telling an audience that ""we cannot, we must not vilify police officers.""The reason Obama and Clinton are having such difficulty dealing with the Dallas shooting is that they've both spent years shouting racism any time a cop shoots a black person. Now that someone has acted on this inflammatory rhetoric, they're awkwardly trying to back pedal.Worse still, it appears that the entire narrative about racist cops killing blacks is wrong.A new study, published by the prestigious National Bureau of Economic Research, found ""no evidence of racial discrimination in officer-involved shootings."" The study, by Harvard economics professor Roland Fryer Jr., studied data from three major cities.In fact, Fryer found that in Houston, ""blacks are 23.8% less likely to be shot at by police relative to whites. Hispanics are 8.5% less likely.""Fryer did find racial disparities in the use of nonlethal force — handcuffs, pepper spray, drawing a weapon, etc. -- but noted that some of that disappeared when the interactions were considered in context. In any case, he notes that ""the probability that any civilian is subjected to such treatment is small.""Police drew their weapons in just 0.26% of interactions with civilians and drew a baton only 0.02% of the time.""These are rare events,"" he says.What does it say about political leaders who are willing to exaggerate a problem and whip up racial hostilities for political gain, and then pretend that their own rhetoric has nothing to do with the resulting violence?Follow IBD Editorials on Twitter and Facebook.

245,COP,"Where to start with actor Jesse Williams' widely praised rant on police brutality and white racism delivered at this year's Black Entertainment Television awards show?To his enthusiastic audience, Williams reeled off lie after lie, all in the name of black ""resistance"" over the ""oppressor"" -- meaning anyone he believes benefits from ""this invention called whiteness."" Time magazine called his discourse ""powerful.""Where are fact-checkers when the fact-devoid desperately need fact-checking? After all, Williams practically begged  to be fact-checked when he said, ""What we've been doing is looking at the data and we know that police somehow manage to de-escalate, disarm and not kill white people every day.""The ""police ... manage to ... not kill white people every day""?Let's start with 2014, the last year for which there are official records. According to the Centers for Disease Control, the police killed 261 whites and 131 blacks. The CDC also found that from 1999 to 2013, the police killed almost twice the number of whites compared to blacks, 3,160 and 1,724, respectively.Activists promptly note that whites account for nearly 65% of the population and that, therefore, one would expect whites to comprise most of those killed by cops. And we are told that blacks, while 13% of the population, represent a much greater percentage of those killed by cops. Institutional, systemic, structural racism!Here's what those promoting the ""police disproportionately kill black people"" narrative consistently omit. Whites, despite being almost 65% of the population, disproportionately commit less  of the nation's violent crime -- 10%. Blacks, at 13% of the population, disproportionately commit more  violent crime. As to murders, black commit nearly half. Yet whites are 50% of cop killings.Criminology professor Peter Moskos looked at the numbers of those killed by officers from May 2013 to April 2015 and found that 49% were white, while 30% were black. ""Adjusted for the homicide rate,"" says Moskos, ""whites are 1.7 times more likely than blacks to die at the hands of police."" So if anything, whites have more to complain about than Mr. Williams.What about traffic stops and race? Surely cops racially profile blacks, wrongly and disproportionately stopping them? Not according to the National Institute of Justice, the research arm of the Department of Justice. In its 2013 report, ""Race, Trust and Police Legitimacy,"" the NIJ found that 75% of blacks admitted that they were stopped for ""legitimate reasons."" And it turns out blacks disproportionately commit traffic offenses, whether speeding, driving without a license, driving with expired tags, driving without the seat belt on or without a car seat for a baby, and so on. Numerical disparities, said the NIJ, result from ""differences in offending"" in addition to ""differences in exposure to the police"" and ""differences in driving patterns.""What about 2015, a year in which Black Lives Matter protested a number of high-profile police/black suspect encounters? According to The Washington Post, the police killed 965 people. But the Post found that ""white police officers killing unarmed black men represent less than 4% of fatal police shootings."" Remember, a black man, extremely popular among blacks, has been president for over seven years. He has nominated, and Congress has approved, back-to-back attorneys general. Nothing stops the Department of Justice from filing civil rights charges against the officers for ""murder."" But the DOJ has not done so.Williams attacked whites for engaging in what has become known as ""cultural appropriation,"" although he did not use that term. He said: ""This invention called whiteness uses and abuses us, burying black people out of sight and out of mind while extracting our culture, our dollars, our entertainment like oil -- black gold, ghettoizing and demeaning our creations then stealing them, gentrifying our genius and then trying us on like costumes before discarding our bodies like rinds of strange fruit. The thing is though ... the thing is that just because we're magic doesn't mean we're not real.""That's a mouthful, especially when the primary buyers of rap music, a black-dominated genre, mostly are white consumers. Snoop Dogg, Ice-T, Run-D.M.C. and Jay Z got rich while happily being culturally appropriated by white kids living in the suburbs.It's also interesting to note that Williams is a product of a white mother and black father, both of whom were in the audience. So his mom is an ""invention,"" while his dad is ""magic."" Must make for interesting conversation in the Williams' home at dinnertime. And a rich, half-white actor delivered an attack on whites on a cable channel owned by a corporation whose primarily shareholders are a family headed by a patriarch named Sumner Redstone, a Jew.Only in America.
"
246,COP,"University of Missouri at St. Louis criminologist Richard Rosenfeld has had ""second thoughts."" Like many academic criminologists, he had pooh-poohed charges that skyrocketing murder rates in many cities in 2015 and 2016 are the result of a ""Ferguson effect"" -- a skittering back from proactive policing for fear of accusations of racism, like those that followed the death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., in August 2014.Now, after looking over 2015 data from 56 large cities, he's changed his mind. Homicides in those cities were up 17% from 2014. And 10 cities, all with large black populations, saw homicides up 33% on average.""These aren't flukes or blips, this is a real increase,"" Rosenfeld said. ""The only explanation that gets the timing right is a version of the Ferguson effect.""Rosenfeld thus parts company with the liberal Brennan Center, whose analysts argued that the 2015 homicide increase in large cities was not a ""national pandemic."" He parts company also with FiveThirtyEight analyst Carl Bialik, who dismissed a 16% homicide increase in 59 of the 60 largest cities in 2014 and 2015 as ""a less dire picture than the one painted by reports in several large media outlets.""But a 16% or 17% increase in homicides in major cities that account for a large share of the national murder toll is, in historical perspective, very dire indeed. The most accurate word is ""unprecedented."" The only double-digit increases in national murder statistics going back to 1960 are 13% (in 1968), 11% (in 1966, 1967 and 1971) and 10% (in 1979).As anyone familiar with the workings of compound interest might guess, such increases rapidly added up. The total number of homicides nationally more than doubled between 1966 and 1979. The number peaked in 1991.During those years, most academic criminologists argued that high rates of violent crime resulted from economic distress and -- noting that nearly half of murders were committed by blacks -- from the endemic racism in American society. Today the Brennan Center echoes this analysis: ""Economic deterioration of those cities could be a contributor to murder increases.""Political scientist James Wilson and maverick criminologist George Kelling dissented from this view. In their 1982 Atlantic article, ""Broken Windows,"" they argued that proactive policing and elimination of signs of disorder (like broken windows) could sharply reduce crime rates.In the 1990s, New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani and Police Commissioner Bill Bratton put the ""broken windows"" theory into effect. Their proactive policing tactics were continued by Mayor Michael Bloomberg and widely imitated and adapted around the country.The result was that homicides in New York were reduced from 2,445 in 1990 to 328 in 2014. Nationally, the number of murders declined 42% from 1991 to 2014.The definitive chronicler of proactive policing, the Manhattan Institute's Heather Mac Donald, spotlighted the Ferguson effect in a Wall Street Journal article in May 2015. She noted that arrests were sharply down in cities such as St. Louis and Baltimore because the ""incessant drumbeat against the police"" across the country had ""officers scale back on proactive policing under the onslaught of anti-cop rhetoric.""Those encouraging such rhetoric include President Obama and his first attorney general, Eric Holder -- even though an intensive Justice Department investigation of Brown's killing in Ferguson cleared the officer involved and made clear that charges that Brown had put up his hands and surrendered were baseless.Obama has since said that ""there's no data to support"" a Ferguson effect. That puts him at odds with his appointee, FBI Director James Comey, who says that his conversations with police officials around the country convinced him that there are ""marginal pullbacks by lots and lots of police officers."" It also put Obama at odds with Rosenfeld, who has found clear evidence of ""de-policing"" in Baltimore and Chicago, where homicides have spiked.The charge of cherry-picking data and misleading rhetoric can more justifiably be leveled against administration officials and mainstream media, who, after the Ferguson killing, created the impression of a rising epidemic of racist police officers shooting innocent blacks. The few such cases have received prompt and stern attention from local law enforcement.Black Americans were the primary victims of the huge crime increase starting in the late 1960s, and they will be the primary victims again if the Ferguson effect continues to result in more homicides. Can't we prevent this awful history from repeating itself?

247,COP,"ConocoPhillips' (COP) reported a steep loss in the first quarter and reduced its 2016 capital spending even further.The exploration and production company now sees capital expenditures this year of $5.7 billion, down from a prior outlook of $6.4 billion on ""reduced deepwater exploration activity, deferrals and lower costs across the portfolio.""Conoco reported a loss of $1.18 per share vs. a 22-cent per-share profit a year ago. Not including special items, the company's loss widened to 95 cents a share from 18 cents, beating analyst views for a $1.05 loss.Conoco shares closed down 0.9% in the stock market today, despite another rally in oil prices.Q1 production was 1.58 million barrels of oil per day, down by 32,000 barrels a day vs. a year ago.For Q2, Conoco sees production of 1.5 million-1.54 million barrels on ""significant planned turnaround activity during the quarter."" Conoco still sees full-year production of 1.53 million barrels a day.The company said it lowered operating costs by more than 20% year over year.Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) earnings are on tap for Friday.
"
248,COP,"Exxon Mobil's (XOM) first-quarter results beat Wall Street views Friday, while Chevron (CVX) swung to a loss, amid sharp deterioration in their refining businesses despite the benefit of cheap oil.Exxon's Q1 earnings plunged 63% to $1.81 billion, or 43 cents a share, but topped analysts' EPS views by 12 cents. Revenue fell 28% to $48.7 billion, above views for $48.1 billion. Q1 is Exxon's sixth straight quarter of double-digit EPS and revenue declines.Exploration and production, or upstream, operations swung to a loss of $76 million as the U.S. upstream's losses deepened to $832 million from $52 million a year ago. Refining, or downstream, earnings sank 46% to $906 million on weaker margins.Cheap oil typically boosts refining by lowering its input costs, and the downstream unit had cushioned the blow of low prices upstream. But a glut of petroleum products has weighed on downstream profits recently.Exxon's capital and exploration spending fell 33% to $5.1 billion. But production rose 1.8%, with liquid output up 11.5% and gas down 9.3%.On Tuesday, Standard & Poor's stripped Exxon of its AAA credit rating, which it held for nearly 50 years, on low commodity prices, high reinvestment requirements and continued large dividend payments. The oil major responded by raising its quarterly dividend Wednesday to 75 cents from 73 cents as the company continues to appease investors.Exxon shares closed up 0.4% in the stock market today, paring back earlier gains as crude futures dipped on a Reuters survey showing OPEC's April output rose to 32.64 million barrels a day from 32.47 million barrels in March.U.S. crude settled down 0.2% to $45.92 a barrel but ended the month of April up 20%. Brent crude finished essentially flat Friday and up 21% on the month.Chevron swung to a loss of $725 million, or 39 cents per share, for Q1 from a profit of $2.57 billion, or $1.07 a share, a year ago. Foreign exchange cut earnings by $319 million in the latest quarter and boosted them by $580 million a year ago. Revenue fell 32% to $23.56 billion,Analysts expected a 20-cent per-share loss on revenue of $21.4 billion.The upstream business swung to a loss of $1.46 billion from a year-ago profit of $1.56 billion. Downstream earnings were nearly halved to $735 million.“Our capital spending is coming down,” said CEO John Watson in the earnings release. “We are moving our focus to high-return, shorter-cycle projects and pacing longer-cycle investments.”Chevron shares fell 0.2%.This week, Baker Hughes (BHI) warned that North American rig counts are expected to fall 30% in Q2 vs. the Q1 average and said it doesn’t see activity “to meaningfully increase in 2016,” but U.S. rig counts may stabilize in the second half of  the year. International rig counts are expected to fall ” steadily through the end of the year.”The oilfield service provider said the U.S. oil rig count fell by 11 to 332, the sixth consecutive decline.Also this week, ConocoPhillips (COP) reported a steep loss in the first quarter and reduced its 2016 capital spending even further. France’s Total (TOT) said Q1 net profit fell 40% year over year to $1.61 billion. But production hit 2.48 million barrels of oil a day, the highest in 10 years. BP's (BP) profit beat analyst exceptions, but the British oil company said it was considering further capital spending cuts in 2017.
"
249,COP,"After crawling ahead at just a 0.5% annual pace in the first quarter, the slowest in two years, the American economy is due for a bounce -- but how high?The jury is out whether the economy has simply hit another speed bump or is facing a more fundamental slowdown, but some details in Thursday's Commerce Department report point to the latter.U.S. GDP also fizzled at the start of 2014 and 2015, shrinking 0.9% in the former and edging up 0.6% last year, only to come charging back in the second quarter, growing 4.9% and 3.9% respectively. But the momentum didn't last, with full-year GDP rising a moderate 2.4% in both 2014 and 2015.Yet it's iffy whether the economy can rebound to the same extent this year and offset the impact of a weak first quarter. Something has to give: If the economy doesn't speed up in a big way, it's hard to see how employers can keep adding 200,000-plus jobs per month.On the plus side, some really bad news is out of the way.Financial markets have rallied from an early 2016 rout after hitting bottom on Feb. 11.After crashing well below $30 a barrel, oil prices have climbed back above $45. That should mean a gradual easing of the sector's hit to capital spending, though ConocoPhillips (COP) on Thursday cut its capex forecast yet again. Overall, business fixed investment fell at a 5.9% annual rate in Q1, the worst decline since Q2 2009, at the tail end of the last recession.Inventory destocking, which subtracted one-third of a percentage point from GDP growth -- and acted as a drag for the third straight quarter -- may be less of an issue going forward.Lastly, the 3.6% drop in defense spending looks like an anomaly, according to Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at IHS Global Insight. ""Given the end of the sequester on spending,"" budget analysts expected an increase in spending, he wrote.Behravesh thinks 3% GDP growth the rest of the year is likely, with growth of 2% or more this quarter.Yet there are reasons to question whether the economy will be quite as resilient.Although this year's headline Q1 GDP figure wasn't especially weak relative to the starts of 2014 and 2015, real final sales to domestic purchasers rose just 1.2%, the weakest annualized gain since Q2 2013. Real sales, which strip out net exports and inventory investment, is ""about as core a measure of GDP as there is,"" wrote Steve Blitz, chief economist at ITG Investment Research.His point is that U.S. final demand has been softening more than it did at the start of the past two years. Personal consumption expenditures rose a mild 1.9% from Q4, the weakest in a year. And spending on goods rose just 0.1%, the worst in nearly five years. Spending on durable goods, such as autos, fell 1.6%. It's unclear whether General Motors (GM) and Ford (F) can continue to propel sales higher to help fuel the economy this year.Blitz noted that 41% of the increase in consumer spending went toward rent and health, leaving modest gains in the rest of the consumer sector.Meanwhile, the Commerce Department said that the saving rate rose to 5.2% of disposable income, tied for the highest since 2012.Little wonder that a wide swath of corporations, from Wall Street banks to food companies and big industrial firms, are redoubling efforts to squeeze costs to boost earnings with domestic and global demand so sluggish.Residential fixed investment surged 14.8%, the best in four years and good news for the likes of Home Depot (HD). That contributed 0.49 percentage point to the rise in GDP growth -- basically the whole thing.Whether the economy bounces back as strongly as last year will ultimately depend on income growth, and so far the data don't look great, despite solid job gains. One problem may be that those gains have been tilted toward lower-pay jobs.Despite recent pay hikes from Wal-Mart (WMT), Costco (COST) and Target (TGT), federal income and employment taxes withheld from paychecks are up 3.3% from a year ago since mid-March. That's an improvement from growth below 3% earlier in the year, but still well below the 5%-plus gains that helped the economy rebound a year ago.

250,COP,"Oil majors like BP (BP), Chevron (CVX) Exxon Mobil (XOM) announce quarterly results this week as oil remains under pressure, and investors will listen carefully for any signs their dividends will go the way of payouts at smaller energy companies.The outlook for prices dimmed after top OPEC and non-OPEC producers failed to agree on an oil production freeze at a summit in Doha, Qatar, earlier this month. And Barclays analysts remain bearish on crude, saying Monday that elevated inventory levels and increased supply from Iran could push oil prices even lower.Oil majors have already cut spending plans and trimmed their workforce to try and stay profitable as crude prices stay lower for longer.BP said in January it would cut 4,000 jobs over the next two years, and its once untouchable dividend now looks to be under pressure, with Chairman Carl-Henric Svanberg saying this month the company would  “revisit our financial framework” if oil stays lower.BP is expected to swing to a 17-cent per-share loss in Q1 from an 85-cent per-share profit a year ago when it announces earnings Tuesday. Analysts see revenue falling 26.8%  to $41.16 billion.ConocoPhillips (COP) has already slashed its dividend by 66% and trimmed its 2016 capital expenditure outlook by 17% vs. a prior view in December. Conoco is expected to report a third straight quarter of steeper losses and a 3.7% drop in revenue when it announces results Thursday.Both Chevron and Exxon report Friday.Analysts see Exxon’s earnings falling 73.5% to 31 cents a share, its largest decline since the current oil bust began in 2014. Revenue is seen down 32.7%.In March, Exxon cut its 2016 capital spending by 25% to $23 billion. The company also said it would focus on increasing its dividend even as other oil companies like Conoco cut theirs. But Exxon has had to borrow money to fund its dividend payments.Chevron is expected to swing to a 15-cent per-share loss vs. a $1.07 per-share profit in the year-ago quarter. In March, the integrated energy giant said it plans to spend $26.6 billion this year but just $17 billion-$22 billion a year in 2017 and 2018.Despite lower crude prices, Chevron’s CEO told CNBC in January that paying dividends was still the company’s “No.1 priority.”

WTI crude futures settled down 2.5% at $42.64 a barrel.Energy Select Sector SPDR (XLE) fell 1.1%. The energy sector leads the S&P 500 year to date.XLE is up 10.7% so far in 2016 and regained its 200-day moving average this month for the first time since September 2014.

252,COP,"BP (BP) could be the next oil major to cut its dividend, if oil stays lower for longer.On Thursday, BP Chairman Carl-Henric Svanberg said the company would  ""revisit our financial framework"" if oil stays lower.“We know that the dividend is important to you, our shareholders,” he said in prepared remarks at BP’s annual shareholder meeting, according reports. “Our goal is to maintain the dividend but at the same time we must secure the future by investing wisely. Be assured that we keep this balance under regular review.”BP shares closed down 1.5% in the stock market today. Ahead of its annual meeting today, shareholders also voted against a 20% raise for CEO Bob Dudley, who already saw his pay increase to $19.6 million in 2015 from $16.4 million in 2014.In February, ConocoPhillips (COP) slashed its dividend by 66% to 25 cents. Other oil majors have vowed to defend their dividends, with Chevron (CVX) saying recently it is the ""highest priority"" for the balance sheet. Exxon Mobil (XOM) has had to borrow money to fund its dividend payments.Exxon shares climbed 0.7%, and Chevron rose 0.4%. Conoco rallied 1.5%.Brent crude futures dropped 0.8% to $43.84 a barrel per barrel. U.S. crude fell 0.6% to settle at $41.50.Also Thursday, the International Energy Agency said that oil markets would ""move close to balance"" during the second half of the year as non-OPEC production falls on lower oil prices.The agency sees surplus production falling to 200,000 barrels per day in the latter half of the year from 1.5 million in the first half, as expensive U.S. fracking dries up. Iran is also increasing production gradually after sanctions were lifted.The Energy Information Agency said Wednesday U.S. oil production fell to 8.977 million barrels per day, the lowest since October 2014, from 9.008 million barrels a week ago. Crude inventories rose by 6.6 million barrels.

253,COP,"It was a busy week for business, economic and investing news. The stock market came under more pressure as Apple (AAPL) reported its first sales decline since 2003, while Facebook (FB) and Amazon (AMZN) turned on the gas. The Federal Reserve signaled it's in no rush to raise rates, while the U.S. economy crawls.The market rally came under more pressure amid a slew of earnings reports and big economic news. The Nasdaq tumbled 2.7% for the week, falling through its 200-day line on Thursday and its 50-day average on Friday, as losers such as Apple, Twitter (TWTR) and First Solar (FSLR) trumped big gains for Facebook and Amazon. The S&P 500 and Dow are well above those support levels, but also tumbled, with all of the losses coming Thursday-Friday. Oil prices continued to march higher, helped by a weaker dollar and further declines in U.S. production. The 10-year Treasury yield gave up much of its recent gains.How healthy are shares of Amazon and Facebook, and how do they compare to rivals? Find out at IBD Stock CheckupThe tech titan certainly wasn't a growth company in its fiscal second quarter, reporting its first revenue decline since 2003 as iPhone unit sales tumbled. Earnings per share fell 18%, worse than expected. And Apple gave weak guidance for the current quarter. Apple hasn't had a huge product since the big-screen iPhone 6, and smartphone sales generally are stagnating. At this point Apple is so huge it will be hard for a new product to really move the needle.In another sign of its shift from rapid growth to a more mature model, Apple added an additional $50 billion to its shareholder return program, with more buybacks and a higher dividend.Meanwhile, activist investor Carl Icahn decided to cash out of Apple stock, and so did others. Apple stock fell 11.3% for the week, nearly settling at its worst close since mid-2014.Apple chip suppliers generally fared relatively well, in part due to diversifying away from Apple or smartphones generally.Apple Investors Worry Glory Days Are OverThe Federal Reserve, as expected, voted to leave interest rates unchanged at its latest policy meeting and gave no hints that it would tighten before the fall at the earliest. The Fed noted that labor markets have strengthened even as economic growth slowed. And that's true, for now. The U.S. economy rose at a 0.5% annual rate in the first quarter, the weakest in two years. Meanwhile, jobless claims are near 42-year lows. If the economy is barely growing, it's hard to see how the U.S. can continue to add 200,000 jobs a month. But that's what analysts are expecting in Friday's April employment report.The Fed's go-slow approach -- coupled with the Bank of Japan's unexpected decision not to increase its stimulus efforts -- pushed the dollar to big losses. That could boost U.S. multinationals' profits and give a further lift to dollar-priced oil and other commodities.The e-commerce giant sees Q2 sales of $28 billion-$30.5 billion, largely above Wall St. views and a 26% gain at the midpoint. While that would mark a slowdown from Q1's 28% pop, the highest in nearly 4 years, it would still be faster than what was typical the past three years. Q1 earnings also crushed estimates, as cloud unit Amazon Web Services remained hot. China's version of Amazon, Alibaba (BABA), reports Thursday.Alphabet (GOOGL) unit Google, Ford Motor (F), Uber, Lyft and Volvo announced Tuesday the formation of a coalition to advocate for self-driving cars. The lobbying effort comes as automakers race to develop autonomous technologies. Alphabet is in late-stage talks with Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) about a partnership regarding autonomous cars, according to multiple reports. Meanwhile, Tesla Motors (TSLA) already has self-driving features in its electric cars, but has not unveiled plans to join the coalition. Tesla will report earnings on Wednesday, with autonomous tech firm Mobileye (MBLY) out Thursday.Social networking kings Facebook and LinkedIn had a good week, as both posted Q1 earnings that topped estimates and sent the stocks higher. Facebook reported its third straight quarter of accelerating earnings and revenue growth. Despite concerns about slowing user engagement, advertisers are definitely using Facebook. Mobile advertising accounted for 82% of Facebook's $5.2 billion in ad revenue, up from 73% in Q1 2015. Facebook stock spiked Thursday to a record high of 120.71, but pulled back to close the week modestly above a 117.09 buy point.LinkedIn renewed investor confidence after a harrowing Q4 that saw its stock plunge 44%. LinkedIn turned in a solid Q1 earnings that investors applauded.With the U.S. and global economy growing at a tepid pace, companies are stressing cost cuts to prop up earnings as revenue flatlines or falls. In the latest week, defense contractor Lockheed Martin, snack giant  Mondelez International (MDLZ) and Procter & Gamble (PG) announced recent or new efforts to curb expenses, restructure or sell assets. They join the likes of Coca-Cola (KO)  and banking giants JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Bank of America (BAC). While cuts may help companies in the short run, they need stronger top-line growth to fuel earnings longer term.Shifting priorities for media companies came into play last week, as a handful of megamergers captured the spotlight and served as an attempt to keep growing or simply cling to survival. Cable and content titan Comcast (CMCSA) sought to grow in foreign markets via a $3.8 billion deal to buy DreamWorks Animation (DWA), the studio responsible for ""Shrek"" and ""Kung Fu Panda."" Meanwhile, it looks like Comcast rival Charter Communications (CHTR) will be able to keep up, as its $55 billion bid to buy Time Warner Cable (TWC) won regulatory approval. But survival in the struggling newspaper industry was on the mind of USA Today parent Gannett (GCI) as it bid $815 million to buy Tribune Publishing (TPUB), owner of the Los Angeles Times and Chicago Tribune.Crude oil futures continued to rise, hitting 2016 highs. But Big Oil is still adjusting to lower prices. Saudi Arabia aims to reduce its oil dependence and float less than 5% of Saudi Aramco in an IPO, valuing the world’s largest oil company in excess of $2 trillion Meanwhile,  ConocoPhillips (COP) slashed its 2016 capital spending even further and BP (BP) said it was considering further cuts in '17.  Baker Hughes (BHI) warned that N. American rig counts still have room to fall, but the U.S. count may stabilize later this year. Chevron (CVX) swung to a loss in Q1. While U.S. production falls overall, output for most majors rose even as investment fell. Exxon (XOM) lost its AAA rating at S&P, but still kept its commitment to its dividend, raising it to 75 cents from 73 cents.Quarterly results from shale players Continental Resources (CLR), EOG (EOG) and Carrizo (CRZO) are out this week.Medical merger activity took off Thursday. Abbott Laboratories (ABT) inked a $25 billion buyout deal with cardiac device giant St. Jude Medical (STJ). Abbott's former biopharma arm AbbVie (ABBV) agreed to buy biotech startup Stemcentrx for $5.8 billion plus up to $4 billion in possible milestone payments. Big French pharma Sanofi (SNY) made an unsolicited $9.3 billion cash bid for smaller drugmaker Medivation (MDVN). Medivation rejected Sanofi's offer, but Sanofi vowed to press on, and Medivation's stock traded as if investors are expecting Sanofi (and perhaps another bidder) to go higher. Both Stemcentrx and Medivation are focused on cancer treatments, a field that has provided some of the biggest drug launches of recent years.Chipotle Mexican Grill's (CMG) recovery might be slow-going, with April same-store sales down 26% to date, surprising many. The burrito king logged its first-ever quarterly loss -- of 88 cents per share -- in Q1, though Wall Street expected worse. A revenue decline to $834.5 million missed views, as comps plummeted 29.7%.But another fast-casual chain, Panera Bread (PNRA), reported strong results. Its stock is setting up in a short consolidation going back to March 8.Burger King parent Restaurant Brands International (QSR) turned in mixed results, Domino's Pizza (DPZ) missed completely and Dunkin' Brands (DNKN) edged past forecasts.
"
254,COP,"For Army Staff Sgt. Clinton Romesha and the men of Command Outpost (COP) Keating, the dawn of Oct. 3, 2009, started quietly enough.Intelligence came in that the Taliban were planning an attack, but the terrorists attacked almost every day, so the Americans went about their regular duties.But at 6 a.m., all hell broke loose. Roughly 300 Taliban descended on the 50 soldiers defending Keating. An additional 100 attacked the 20 troops in a protective position on one of the surrounding hillsides.Romesha was the squad leader of one of four platoons assigned to the COP. And he came through something fierce.He was credited with personally killing 30 terrorists -- and saving the COP from being overrun. Such heroics and solid leadership earned him the Medal of Honor in 2013.His experiences blaze the pages of his new memoir, “Red Platoon: A True Story of American Valor.”Romesha, 34, grew up on a family ranch in Lake City, Calif., a community so small that he was one of only 15 students in his high school graduating class.His family had a tradition of military service. His grandfather served as a combat engineer in World War II, and his father was in Vietnam. Clint felt no familial pressure to enlist, but still, he saw both his older brothers sign up.So Romesha did the same in September 1999.“I thought I’d only do a couple of years, but after I joined, I realized the military was a really good fit,” he told IBD.  He stayed in for a dozen years.Romesha's first overseas station was Kosovo in eastern Europe.Then came the terror of 9/11, after which he volunteered for Iraq, one of his two deployments there. In the combat zone, he experienced the frustrations that many front-line soldiers do, particularly with restrictive rules that prevented Americans from firing on the enemy until first fired upon.“There would be situations where we knew there were bad guys out there,” he said. “But because of the rules of engagement -- put in to prevent atrocities (by Americans) -- you had to wait.  You couldn’t fire until you were actually under fire. I taught my guys that it’s better to be judged by 12 than carried by six.  Some guys would be afraid to fire, and I was afraid that would get one of our guys killed.”So Romesha took chances with the enemy. “I’d ride fully exposed (in the turret of his vehicle) to give them a target to entice them to give away their position.”Whatever he did, he did it well enough that between his two trips to Iraq, the Army sent him to the prestigious Cavalry Scout school at Fort Benning, Ga., where he gained expertise in reconnaissance, countersurveillance, navigation and radio and satellite communications.He also built on his leadership skills.  The most important lesson: Listen to the people you’re leading. One was a noncommissioned officer.“One of the greatest NCOs I ever had,"" he said, ""taught me that a good leader is the guy who adjusts his style to the people he’s leading. A bad leader is one (who is) set in his ways and expects everyone to come in and conform to his way of thinking.“Leadership is a tough thing to teach. You have to understand that you don’t always have the total perspective. When you listen to your guys, it totally can change your thinking and open your eyes. It also allows the people under you to feel they have input.”Romesha surrounded himself with soldiers who complemented his skills. He’s not good with numbers. “I love history, but I’m terrible with dates,” he said. So he always stayed close to a numbers guy who could keep track of things like target coordinates.Romesha learned another lesson on his second tour to Iraq: Survival in a war zone is random. A close friend, one of the best soldiers he’d ever met, was killed by a sniper. It made him a fatalist: “If you get in the mindset that you’re going to be a perfect soldier and nothing will happen to you because of all your training -- well, that mindset is destructive. You can’t make any assumptions. You can’t take anything for granted. All you can do is think about what you’re doing in this moment and the next moment, and not lose your edge.”Devastated by the loss, Romesha adopted positive thinking that he tried to share with soldiers under his command: “You can’t go back and change what happened. What are we going to bring to the fight? Understand the experience, but don’t dwell on it.”Landing in Afghanistan in May 2009, Romesha was with B Troop, 3-61 Cavalry, part of the famed 4th Infantry Division, whose lineage goes back to World War I.Listening and imparting wisdom boosted his Medal of Honor career. Jake Tapper, who wrote “The Outpost: An Untold Story of American Valor” about Keating and interviewed the survivors, said of Romesha: “His men love him and revere him. They would risk their lives for him to this day.”One was Spc. Thomas Rasmussen, who served at Keating and lauds the former staff sergeant: “I just don’t know how to narrow it down. Everything about his leadership makes you trust him and not second-guess anything he says. If he tells you the sky outside is orange, and you know it’s blue, you’ll still think it’s orange because that’s how much you trust him.”He is convinced that without Romesha, no American would have survived the onslaught. “No, definitely not.”Tapper feels the same: “Clint’s actions that day, fearless and selfless, were pivotal in the fight to reclaim COP Keating.”Romesha's command leadership became evident right after the attack commenced. His immediate boss was home on leave, so he was acting platoon sergeant. It meant that he had different responsibilities than he was used to; he had to fight his instincts to jump into the middle of the battle with his men.“Normally, I’d run out and assume a position and start fighting,"" he recalled. ""But that day, I don’t think I discharged my weapon (in the first few hours). I got out of bed, put on my kit and ran to the command post to monitor the radios tracking where everyone was, who is injured and who needs help.”He knew what he had to do, because he’d always made it a point of “knowing two jobs above your pay grade and every job below it.""Meanwhile, Romesha was busy encouraging his troops, reminding them of the basics they’d practiced in drills back in the States. He relied on a crucial theory: “When you are facing an attack from several directions, it’s important not to allow yourself to get fixed on a single individual or group. Don’t get tunnel vision. Send a burst toward each one and move on.”The battle for Keating raged for 13 hours, and in its early stages it appeared that all was lost. Air support was far away, with bad weather making air support even less likely.Not only did the Taliban have superior firing positions, but also over the course of the preceding months, they’d observed Keating. The terrorists knew the Americans’ defensive positions. This knowledge enabled the Taliban to zero in on Keating’s gun trucks and mortar positions, essentially muting their effectiveness. They also knocked out the post’s generator.Romesha reluctantly agreed when one of the sergeants insisted on a mission to save a soldier under serious fire in a truck.“I could have argued, but (short of a physical confrontation) there was nothing I could do to stop him,"" said Romesha. “He understood that what he was going on was going to be a suicide mission.”With the rescuer and rescuee dying, Romesha quickly realized that in this case, the best defense was a good offense. Knowing also that the Taliban would use as propaganda any American bodies they were able to recover, he devised and led two missions to fight back.So he left the command post and returned to the barracks where more soldiers were awaiting instructions after elements of the Taliban had breached sections of the perimeter wire.“When he came to the barracks looking for volunteers to take the COP back, he didn’t say much,” Rasmussen said. “But just from the look on his face, I knew that from that point on we were going to be all right.”Romesha led his men on counteroffensives that reclaimed American bodies and kept the enemy at bay until superior American air power came to the rescue.The Army estimates that 100 to 150 terrorists were killed, with additional ones wounded.  American losses were eight dead and 27 wounded.Romesha left the Army in 2011 and settled in North Dakota, where he worked in the oil industry. More recently, he’s become a consultant working for a couple of nonprofits.In the conclusion of his book, Romesha wrote of the highest American award for valor:“I would immediately trade that medal and everything attached to it if it would bring back even one of my missing comrades in arms.”Won the Medal of Honor for his actions defending an outpost in Afghanistan.Overcame: An overwhelming enemy force that far outnumbered the outpost’s defenders.Lesson: Good leadership and focus can overcome a superior force.“Never lose sight of the fact that your primary concern (as a leader) is the mission, not the men.”

255,COP,"Environment: A report says Earth is turning greener thanks to carbon dioxide emissions. But America isn't doing its part. While other countries are pumping out more CO2, the U.S. has cut its output.Carbon dioxide is the environmentalists' bogey man. In their narrative, it is an evil gas that, when produced by man, heats the globe to intolerable levels. But CO2 is just part of nature -- even when generated by human activities -- and it is making the world greener.According to the study ""Greening of the Earth and its Drivers” that appeared in the journal Nature Climate Change, there is ""a persistent and widespread increase of growing season integrated LAI (greening) over 25% to 50% of the global vegetated area.""At the same time, less than 4% of the globe is browning.The authors, 32 of them from 24 institutions, say that ""factorial simulations with multiple global ecosystem models suggest that CO2 fertilization effects (man's emissions) explain 70% of the observed greening trend.""Isn't this what environmental activists want -- a greener Earth? Don't they want us all to ""go green""? Well, we are. Except for America. U.S. emissions of carbon dioxide here are decreasing. In 2000, America pumped out 5,868 million metric tons of CO2, then 6,001 million metric tons in 2007, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The figure fell to 5,406 in 2014.Meanwhile, total world CO2 emissions have increased from 24,780 million metric tons in 2000, to 31,261 million metric tons in 2007, to 35,890 million metric tons in 2014, says the Global Carbon Atlas.Clearly America hasn't held up its end of the greening of Earth as it should have.Despite the report about carbon dioxide emissions' beneficial effects on our world, the study's authors felt the need to adopt the environmentalists' narrative. Yes, Earth is greener thanks to CO2, they say in their news release. But they don't want the global warming contrarians to use the greening to ""argue against cuts in carbon emissions to mitigate climate change, similar to those agreed at the 21st Conference of Parties (COP) meeting in Paris last year under the U.N. Framework on Climate Change.""It's absurd. These researchers are willing to throw out all the good news so that the demonization of carbon dioxide can continue. For example, Ranga Myneni of Boston University, the study's lead author, told the BBC that the extra tree growth would not make up for global warming, rising seas, melting glaciers, ocean acidification, the loss of Arctic sea ice, and the forecasts of more severe tropical storms supposedly caused by man's CO2 emissions.Likeminded Philippe Ciais, a contributing lead author of a carbon chapter in a recent U.N. report, similarly insists that increased CO2 in the atmosphere will cause ""global warming, rising sea levels, melting glaciers and sea ice, more severe tropical storms, etc.""This being the case, then we'd expect the environmentalist left to be in favor of fracking, one of the chief contributors to falling CO2 emissions in the U.S. But fracking is one of the environmentalists' bad boys. It will never be embraced.It's truly impossible to win with these people. They say carbon dioxide emissions are unacceptable, but a method of extracting fossil fuels that actually leads to cuts in CO2 emissions is nevertheless deemed evil. Then science determines that CO2 is greening the world, but that's not enough for the environmentalists because they are already fully committed to the CO2 fraud.So what do they want? A green world entirely sanitized of fossil fuels and by extension completely barren of man-made CO2? If so, they should simply demand that every nation emulate Venezuela, where dependable energy is just a rumor. That's the future they've been hoping for.

256,COP,"Dividends are no longer untouchable, as National Oilwell Varco (NOV) cut its payout to boost its cash flow and warned on first-quarter revenue Monday.The oilfield equipment maker slashed its dividend by 89% to 5 cents per share.National Oilwell Varco shares closed down 6% in the stock market today.“Reducing our dividend will allow us to preserve capital to invest in future growth opportunities and enhance the core capabilities our customers will need when industry activity increases,” CEO Clay Williams said in a release.The company said the dividend cut will increase its net cash flow by $615 million per year.Oil companies have slashed their once-protected dividends as oil prices stay lower for longer. In February, Anadarko Petroleum (APC) cut its dividend by 81%, and ConocoPhillip’s (COP) lowered its payout by 66%. Devon Energy (DVN) cut its dividend by 75% and plans to lay off 20% of its workforce in Q1.Exxon Mobil (XOM) had to borrow money to fund its dividend, and BP (BP) is facing pressure on its payout as well.Anadarko fell 1.6%, BP edged up 0.5%, and Conoco dipped 0.1%. Exxon shares finished 0.1% higher, and Devon shares climbed 1%.Williams also said Monday that Q1 revenue would be down 20% from $2.7 billion in Q4 as lower oil prices have reduced exploration and production funding for the year, lowering demand for its equipment and services. The company’s debt has risen more than $500 million since the start of the year.Image provided by Shutterstock.

Meanwhile, crude prices rallied in electronic trading on a big supply drawdown.Wynn Resorts said it expects fiscal Q1 combined Macau-Las Vegas casinos revenue of $987 million to $1.007 billion. The midpoint missed analyst consensus of $998.33 million. The company said the shortfall was due to its Macau casinos, as that special administrative district on China's southern coast works through a deep recession. Wynn slid 1.6% in late trading after closing down 2.7% at 90.92.Amazon will release a new Kindle tablet next week, and its first high-end accompanying protective charging case for longer battery life, the Wall Street Journal said, citing sources. Amazon is also developing a solar-capable recharging case, the report said. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos on Monday said in a Tweet that a new top-of-the-line Kindle was nearly ready and that details would be released next week.

The statement indicates that it's passed Amazon in volume shipments, although its revenue of about $14.9 billion a year is dwarfed by Amazon's $107 billion. Alibaba rose a few cents late after closing 2.2% lower at 77.32.Cree shares plunged 18% late after closing down 0.6% at 29.05 after the LED lighting and power chipmaker pre-announced fiscal third quarter earnings that fell far short of Wall Street estimates. Cree now expects fiscal Q3 sales of $367 million and earnings per share of 13-15 cents. Wall Street expected $414.4 million in revenue and 24 cents EPS.Also late Tuesday, crude prices rose late after the American Petroleum Institute said U.S. inventories of crude oil fell by 4.3 million barrels last week, the biggest drop of the year. The trade group had expected inventory to rise by 2.6 million barrels for the week ending March 25. The Energy Information Administration will issue its weekly report Wednesday morning.

260,COP,"Racial Politics: A new national survey finds more than 1 in 3 Americans worry a “great deal” about the state of race relations in America. Anxiety has reached new highs under President Obama. That’s no coincidence. He’s rubbed racial sores raw.Barack Obama was supposed to be a biracial leader who could heal the nation’s racial wounds and bring the country together. But since he took office, national tensions over race have gotten worse than ever, with the share of Americans who worry a lot about race relations soaring to 35% from a bottom of 13% just after Obama took office, according to a shocking new Gallup poll.In fact, racial strife is the highest it’s been in the poll’s 15-year history.“The rising concern about race relations as the nation’s first black president completes his last year in office is a retreat from the optimism that swept the country in the immediate aftermath of President Obama’s first election win in 2008,” the pollster said. ""A Gallup poll one night after Obama won found that 7 in 10 Americans believed race relations would improve because of his victory.”Of course, the opposite occurred. Race relations have sunk, and Obama bears a large share of the blame.In virtually every policy and crisis, he has divided Americans by race, pitting groups against each other and even egging on racial violence. He has left race attitudes in tatters by relentlessly focusing on the problems of race in America.Obama’s open praise of Black Lives Matter -- a militant cop-hating group whose leaders he invited to the White House for more than one meeting -- is just one of many examples in which the president deliberately chose to fan the flames of racial anger. Black Lives Matter has become the most divisive and destructive bully on the block, now terrifying even schools.He also sought the counsel of racial opportunist Rev. Al Sharpton. And in case after case of police shootings, he took the side of violent thugs over law enforcement. Obama even lionized a young St. Louis black man who robbed a store and then beat and tried to disarm a cop who had no choice but to fire in self defense.Obama has viewed virtually every event and issue through a racial lens, acting more like a racial activist than a chief executive.Obama has branded the entire criminal justice system racist -- cops, courts, municipal judges, even jurors. He extends the same false accusation to landlords and employers, along with home lenders, car lenders, payday lenders, credit reporting agencies, debt collection agencies and on and on.To hear Obama, even the most liberal among us are racist. He claims teachers and principals, who have eagerly embraced multiculturalism to a fault, suddenly are conspiring to shove misbehaving black students into a “school-to-prison pipeline,” where they have no choice but to lead a life of crime, thanks to suspensions and expulsions.If we didn’t know any better, we’d think the president suffers from paranoia.Our own polling picked up on this trend back in 2014, when an IBD/TIPP survey found that a stunning 46% of Americans thought race relations worsened under the man who was supposed to usher in a racially harmonious era, while only 18% said they had gotten better.Even the left laments that Obama’s ""vision of post-racial America looks even further away.”Only, he never really had such a vision. His racist preacher gave that away long ago.Obama poisoned race relations to help sell his ""social justice” nostrums, unforgivably doing damage to trust in future presidential candidates of color.

261,COP,"Exxon Mobil (XOM) remained in buy range Thursday, even as oil fell lower and government officials pressured the oil giant to include a climate change resolution at its shareholder meeting.Exxon broke out of a cup with handle earlier this month as oil prices rose on hopes that a production freeze meeting with top OPEC and non-OPEC producers will happen in Qatar next month.Shares fell as low as 82.93 in the stock market today, below the buy point of 83.54. But closed up 0.3% at 83.98.Chevron (CVX) stock rose 1.35%, well above its 50-day and 200-day moving averages. BP (BP) gained 0.7% and Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) added 1.2%.U.S. crude settled 0.8% lower at $39.46 a barrel, and Brent dipped less than 0.1% to $40.44.On Wednesday, U.S. futures closed below $40 after the Energy Information Administration reported a rise of 9.4 million barrels last week. Earlier, the American Petroleum Institute said that inventories rose by 8.8 million barrels, three times the amount that analysts polled by Thomson Reuters were expecting.Oil trading is expected to be light on Friday for the Good Friday holiday and on Monday, a public holiday in the U.K.Exxon is facing other troubles outside falling oil prices. The Securities and Exchange Commission said that the company has to include a climate change resolution on its annual shareholder proxy. Exxon argued earlier that it already provides enough carbon disclosures.If shareholders approve the climate change resolution, Exxon will need to list risks that climate change or environmental legislation would have to its profit.On Wednesday, the Rockefeller Family Fund said that it will sell its chunk of Exxon, saying that companies have “no sane rationale"" to continue exploring for oil as regulators try to curb carbon emissions. The fund was especially critical of Exxon for “morally reprehensible conduct"" over a report by InsideClimate News that the company allegedly knew about climate change in the 1970s but hid reports.In late 2014, the Rockefeller Brothers Fund said that it would sell its investments in fossil fuels. But the Rockefeller Foundation has no intention of divesting its fossil fuel investments.John D. Rockefeller made his fortune in oil and refineries for Standard Oil, a predecessor of Exxon in the 1880s. The Rockefeller Family Fund and Rockefeller Brothers Fund help fund  InsideClimate News, according to its website.Exxon said, “It's not surprising that they’re divesting from the company since they’re already funding a conspiracy against us,"" according to multiple news outlets.Image provided by Shutterstock.

262,COP,"Oil futures fell Wednesday as U.S. stockpiles increased, while the plunge in energy investment is raising fears of a future price shock.The Energy Information Administration reported an increase of 9.4 million barrels last week but stockpiles in Cushing, Okla., fell by 1.26 million barrels. Gasoline stockpiles fell by 4.6 million barrels, signalling stepped-up demand.The American Petroleum Institute, an industry group, said late Tuesday that U.S. crude inventories rose by 8.8 million barrels last week, three times the amount analysts polled by Reuters were expecting.U.S. crude settled 4% lower at $39.79 per barrel. Brent crude fell 3.2% to $40.47.U.S. production fell by 0.3% to 9.038 million barrels per day. Earlier this week, the EIA said that 50% of production in the lower 48 states comes from 2-year-old wells as companies hold off on drilling or completing new wells.That indicates a further decline in output because shale formations require constant drilling and development just to maintain a steady level of production.But as oil stays lower for longer, investment in upstream operations has dwindled, raising concerns of an oil shock as supply won't be enough to cover demand.“We need a lot of investments just to stand still,” Neil Atkinson, head of the International Energy Agency’s Oil Industry and Markets Division, said at an energy conference in Singapore. “There’s danger as we are reaching a point where we are barely investing upstream. If investment doesn’t resume in 2017 and 2018, we can see a spike in oil prices as oil supply can’t meet demand.”Chevron (CVX) has already announced capital spending cuts for the next two years. Exxon Mobil (XOM) and ConocoPhillips (COP) have also cut their 2016 capital expenditure outlooks.Exxon shares closed down 0.4% in the stock market today. Conoco shares fell 4.9%. Chevron shares lost 2%.Oil futures had jumped more than 50% from lows earlier this year as OPEC and non-OPEC countries are expected to meet in Doha, Qatar, on April 17 to discuss freezing output at January levels. On Tuesday, a senior OPEC delegate told the Financial Times that Saudi Arabia would freeze output, regardless of whether Iran participates.But the IEA's Atkinson dismissed the effort to cap production as ""meaningless,"" saying only Saudi Arabia has the ability to increase output. Instead, it appears to be ""some kind of gesture"" meant to build confidence that oil prices will stabilize, according to Reuters.

263,COP,"War On Cops: A chilling new report finds the number of police officers murdered in the line of duty has doubled so far this year compared with the first quarter of last year. Yet the president remains silent about the spike in cop killings.While that shouldn’t come as much of a surprise given his disrespect for law enforcement, it is nonetheless wrong. Recall that Obama has loudly supported a black militant movement that has called for violence against cops.These threats by Black Lives Matter have manifested in the shooting deaths of 16 officers through April 8 of this year vs. eight in the comparable period in 2015, which was already historically high, according to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund, which maintains a database on police fatalities.Recent deaths include:Guindon had been sworn in the previous day and was working her first day on the street with her training officer. She was a member of the U.S. Marine Corps Reserve.So When a 28-year-old police officer was killed in Virginia, just miles from the White House, and another was targeted and killed in Richmond, the president was mute, apparently too busy talking with leaders of Black Lives Matter, who have had access to the Oval Office.Obama embraces them even as they've led protestors in marches demonizing cops as “pigs” and calling for them to “fry” -- a phrase they borrowed from the murderer who ambushed two NYPD cops in the name of Michael Brown.Obama shamelessly echoes Blacks Lives Matter in jawboning cops as racist. His rhetoric has contributed to the atmosphere of hate.Before any more cops are ambushed, we urge the president to for once defend them and demand a halt to the violence targeting them. Blue lives matter, too.

264,COP,"Individual investors won some but not all of what was hoped from a sweeping new rule that tightens conflict-of-interest standards for brokers. Those brokers manage trillions of dollars in retirement accounts such as 401(k)s and IRAs, creating compliance headaches and liability issues for the financial industry.Still, the new rules are more lenient than the financial industry had feared they would be. And that leniency led investors to bid up stocks on Wednesday of many asset managers, brokers and insurers.Life insurer Primerica (PRI) soared nearly 7%. Broker and financial adviser Ameriprise Financial (AMP) rose 1.5%. T. Rowe Price (TROW) rose 1.4%. ""Several of these stocks are trading up today,"" said Morningstar analyst Greggory Warren. ""The rule impact is being seen as not as onerous as feared.""Despite industry relief, overall the rule is seen as a victory for individual investors.The final Labor Department (DOL) fiduciary rule, which follows months of public and industry views on its proposal, requires brokers to act in the best interests of clients when providing retirement advice. The Obama administration claims that will lower costs and boost returns for investors.""Today’s rule ensures that putting clients first is no longer a marketing slogan,"" Labor Secretary Thomas Perez said in a conference with reporters. ""It is the law.""The fiduciary standard of behavior creates new grounds for complaints by investors who feel they have been short-changed by their broker. At the outset of a brokerage relationship, a broker can still require a client to agree to take any disputes to arbitration rather than to court. But now the broker has to meet a higher standard of professional behavior, says Andrew Stoltmann, a Chicago securities-fraud attorney.""(The new rule) creates a strengthened cause of action for those suing their brokers,"" Stoltmann said. The new rule does not mean that DOL itself will become more active as a securities cop, Stoltmann added.The government made some concessions in its final rule after months of criticism from the financial industry.The Investment Company Institute, a group representing mutual funds, last summer called the proposal so complicated that it is unworkable. Brokerages charged that the requirement would add costs that make retirement advice unaffordable for many lower- and middle-income investors.Some financial firms will probably benefit, while others are expected to be hurt.Discount brokerages such as Charles Schwab (SCHW) and TD Ameritrade (AMTD) stand to be helped, Morningstar predicted. So are companies that sell a lot of index and exchange traded products, like State Street (STT), BlackRock (BLK) and Vanguard. And robo-advisors are also likely to gain business. Brokers would be compelled to use their low-cost products and services rather than high cost alternatives.T. Rowe Price stock was up because its funds are relatively good performers, meaning they are more likely to be acceptable investment recommendations by brokers, Warren said. Also, the firm has been bolstering its sales staff in recent months, to boost its IRA business, he added.In its new rule, the Labor Department addressed some industry concerns. The originally proposed eight-month deadline for compliance is gone, replaced by a longer, ""phased"" implementation timetable.Also modified is a requirement for new clients to sign a contract in which any broker conflicts are disclosed. These would include the broker disclosing that high-commission products might be offered even though lower-cost alternatives are available. The final rule says the contract does not have to be signed until a client actually opens an account. The proposed rule called for the contract to be signed when the client first had contact with a broker.Another item dropped from the final rule: a proposed list of acceptable assets that advisors can recommend instead of certain high-risk investments. And a widely expected prohibition of in-house investment products has been dropped.""I'm a little disappointed the DOL has caved on the issue of whether firms can recommend proprietary products like annuities,"" Stoltmann said. ""No real fiduciary could do this. I think the DOL caved on a very crucial issue.""The new rule basically extends a fiduciary standard mainly to brokers when they provide investment advice for retirement accounts. A fiduciary standard requires brokers to act in the best interests of clients. Registered investment advisors (RIAs) are already subject to the fiduciary standard, but a stricter version than imposed by the new rule on brokers, said Stoltmann.The new rule takes aim at IRAs -- particularly on money that is transferred or rolled over into IRAs from workplace retirement accounts such as 401(k)s, says Skip Schweiss, TD Ameritrade head of investor advocacy.Under the old rule, brokers could recommend investments that were merely suitable for clients. The DOL says that the old standard allowed brokers to base recommendations on what would generate commissions for them, even if a better-performing, lower-cost investment was available.The White House -- which supports the tighter standard -- said in February 2015 that investments made on the basis of conflicted advice under the old rule returned roughly 1 percentage point less a year on average than investments made on the advice of fiduciaries.With an estimated $1.7 trillion of IRA assets invested in the type of products that generate conflicts of interest, the White House estimated that the aggregate annual cost of conflicted advice is about $17 billion.""A retiree who receives conflicted advice when rolling over a 401(k) balance to an IRA at retirement will lose an estimated 12% of the value of his or her savings if drawn down over 30 years,"" read the White House report. ""If a retiree receiving conflicted advice takes withdrawals at the rate possible absent conflicted advice, his or her savings would run out more than five years earlier.""With a $100,000 rollover for people age 55 to 64 in 2012, a 12% loss would cost the average investor $12,000.Morningstar forecast a mixed impact for active asset managers, including AllianceBernstein (AB), Cohen & Steers (CNS), Eaton Vance (EV), Federated (FII), Janus Capital Group (JNS) and Legg Mason (LM). The same applies to full-service wealth managers, including Bank of America (BAC), Morgan Stanley (MS), Raymond James (RJF) and Wells Fargo (WFC).These companies have product lineups that include both higher and lower cost products.And some impact could differ from what's expected. Many full-service brokerages could replace commission-based IRA fund sales with IRAs that generate fees on assets. ""As fee-based accounts can have a revenue yield upwards of 60% higher than commission-based, this could translate to as much as an additional $13 billion of revenue for the industry,"" Morningstar reported.Also, full-service wealth managers could stop serving clients with low IRA account balances. Those clients could take an estimated $250 billion to $600 billion in assets to robo-advisors. That could push a number of robo-advisors above the $16 billion to $40 billion asset base that Morningstar estimated they need to become profitable.Even within groups that could be hurt by the new rule, like active asset managers and insurers, some companies could benefit. ""(Firms) with moats will gain market share from their less competitively advantaged peers or ... will be able to adjust their business model to offset the negative financial effects of the rule,"" Morningstar reported.

265,COP,"Chevron (CVX) announced capital spending cuts for the next two years at an analyst meeting Tuesday, while also reiterating the importance of keeping its dividend.The integrated energy giant plans to spend $26.6 billion this year but just $17 billion-$22 billion a year in 2017 and 2018. Last year, the company said it might have to cut capex to as low as $20 million in 2017 and 2018.However, CEO John Watson again spoke of the importance of keeping the company’s dividend intact, even as oil prices stay lower for longer.“We’re completing major projects that have been under construction for several years. This enables us to grow production and reduce spending at the same time, which should improve our net cash flow significantly,” Watson said in the release.Chevron shares closed down 2.1% in the stock market today.Top oil companies have vowed to protect their dividends during the downturn in oil prices so as to keep investors happy. They are hesitant to lose investors if they plan to do a follow-up stock offering.Last week, rival Exxon Mobil (XOM) reiterated plans to cut 2016 capex by 25% to $23.2 billion but similarly said it will focus on paying a larger dividend.But last month, ConocoPhillips (COP) slashed its dividend by 66% and trimmed its 2016 capital expenditure outlook by 17% vs. a prior view in December.Anadarko Petroleum (APC) and Noble Energy (NBL) have also cut their dividends to save cash.Anadarko shares plunged 8.8% Tuesday, and Noble fell 6%. Conoco lost 6.7%, and Exxon dipped 2.2%.Chevron also said Tuesday that it had started production at its Gorgon LNG project in Australia this week and would begin shipping next week.Image provided by Shutterstock.

266,COP,"Yes, Friday is almost here.But first comes today's shipment of discouraging news about the nation's political situation 229 days out from the presidential election.It's an understandable, if dispiriting, national reality worsening in recent years as both parties moved farther apart on a strident partisan scale, and an incumbent president saw no political or fundraising benefit in bridging the divide. The gaping fractures exist within even the same party.For example:Nearly two-out-of-three registered voters say the nominee front-runners for either major political party are not honest or trustworthy -- 64% do not trust Democrat Hillary Clinton and 65% do not trust Donald Trump.Only 34% say Clinton is honest, a new low for her; only 32% see Trump as honest. And neither one is from Chicago. No, wait! Clinton was born there.Fully 54% of voters say they would definitely not ever vote for Trump.And 43% say they'd definitely never cast a ballot for Clinton. (Fox News Poll.)Nearly half of all voters (49%) and one-quarter of Republicans would feel ""scared"" if Trump walked into the Oval Office as commander-in-chief.One-third have that feeling about Clinton.As an explanation for the generally high ratings of this cycle's TV debates, especially for Republican talk-fests, 74% of all voters are ""very"" or extremely"" interested in the campaigns -- for Democrats it's 76%, for Republicans 80%.Interest runs especially strongly among very conservative, middle-aged Republican men and women with college degrees.Clinton and Trump easily stand atop their primary competitors, according to the new Quinnipiac University Poll. Trump earns 43% support to Ted Cruz' 29% and John Kasich's 16%.Clinton easily leads Bernie Sanders 50% to 38%.However, in hypothetical head-to-head November match-ups, there's dramatic change to believe in.Clinton trumps Trump 46% to 40%, contrary to the billionaire's frequent claims. She also tops Cruz, 45% to 42%.Sanders beats Trump by even more, 52% to 38%. Sanders also defeats Cruz, 50% to 39%.But -- Wait for it! -- little old, aw, shucks John Kasich beats Clinton 47% to 39%. Kasich even edges Sanders 45% to 44%. Standby for the immediate Kasich for America news release!But Ohioans shouldn't get too excited about the outlook for Kasich, who has only won the Ohio primary.That's because it is now mathematically impossible for the governor to reach the 1,237 delegate majority to cop the nomination in Cleveland come July.That's barring some kind of extraordinary deal which, of course, is what the governor is counting on. Kasich still holds fewer delegates than Marco Rubio had when he quit the GOP race after losing Florida to Trump.In an open-ended question, the Q-Poll asked voters for one word to describe how they feel about a Trump or Clinton presidency.""Scared"" was the most frequently offered word about a President Trump. Then came ""disaster,"" then ""frightened,"" then ""terrified"" and ""horrified."" The first good word mentioned was, well, ""good.""As for President Hillary Clinton, ""disaster"" was the word that came most frequently to voters' minds. Then followed ""good,"" ""scared,"" ""disappointed"" and, finally, ""hopeful.""Taken together, all of this makes us ""sad.""RELATED:

268,COP,"The United Arab Emirates sees a ""correction"" in oil prices this year, according to reports Monday, as top OPEC and non-OPEC producers prepare to discuss freezing crude output.Ecuador's foreign minister also said Monday that Latin American oil producers will meet Friday to discuss oil prices.Brent settled up 5.5% to $40.84 a barrel, the highest since early December. U.S. oil futures also rallied 5.5% to settle as $37.90 a barrel.Shares of top oil companies climbed in the the stock market today. Exxon Mobil (XOM) rose 2.6%, Chevron (CVX) added 3%, and ConocoPhillips (COP) gained 0.7%. BP (BP) rose 1.1%, and Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) edged up 0.6%.“I’m still optimistic that at the end of the year or before the end of the year, we will see some correction,” UAE Energy Minister Suhail al Mazrouei told Bloomberg. “We need to be patient. It’s not happening in weeks or months. Correcting to a sustainable price will take time.”Al Mazrouei said he didn't receive an invention to a producers' meeting that Nigerian Minister of State for Petroleum Resources Emmanuel Kachikwu announced. But al Mazrouei would go if he receives an invite.“It’s logical for everyone to freeze their production,” al Mazrouei said. “It doesn’t make sense for anyone to increase production at the current prices.”Earlier, Venezuelan Oil Minister Eulogio Del Pino said he would meet with his counterparts from Saudi Arabia, Russia and Qatar in March to talk about freezing output at January levels.Saudi Arabia has said it would freeze production, but only if other major producers followed suit. But at the IHS CERAWeek conference in Houston in February, Saudi Oil Minister Ali al-Naimi cautioned that a further step is unlikely, saying a production cut “is not going to happen.”Meanwhile, the Monte Toledo oil tanker arrived in Spain on Sunday, carrying the first barrels of Iranian crude to Europe since 2012. The tanker had 1 million barrels of oil. The import ban on Iranian crude was lifted in January.

270,COP,"A day after the Federal Reserve pressed the brakes on future interest rate hikes, dividend ETFs sped up on the stock markets.The Relative Strength (RS) lines of several dividend-paying ETFs were making new highs Thursday. It's a sign that they're outperforming the broad market.The momentum behind dividend ETFs is telling. Only a dozen exchange traded funds out of 1,745 tracked by IBD boast of a bolting RS line -- a bullish technical sign -- in the current climate.Dividend-paying stocks tend to hold up better in times of market volatility, said Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF research for S&P Capital IQ. Plus, as bond yields stay lower for longer, investors are looking to higher-yielding stocks and sectors for their income needs.""We're still down for the year, even after bouncing back,"" Rosenbluth noted. ""Dividend ETFs offer the benefit of stable income with capital appreciation potential.""WisdomTree High Dividend (DHS) tracks a high-yielding benchmark of large-cap value stocks.The ETF has $986.3 million in assets and a 3.5% yield. The underlying index screens for all dividend-paying U.S. stocks that meet size and liquidity requirements. The highest-yielding 30% from this group makes it into the DHS portfolio. Its stock weighting method is unusual.""To minimize the impact of high-yielding but high-risk companies, DHS weights constituents in proportion to the total dollar amount of dividends paid,"" Michael Rawson, a Morningstar analyst, wrote in a recent report.Despite this, DHS can be a risky fund and has had more volatile returns than the large-cap value category and the S&P 500 since its June 2006 inception, Rawson added.The ETF holds 442 stocks, with AT&T (T), Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Verizon (VZ) among its top three holdings.Its heavy portfolio weightings in the consumer staples and utilities sectors (roughly 30% combined) could pose a risk if interest rates were to rise. Its 15% stake in the troubled energy sector could spell trouble too.Among many oil and gas companies, high yields have come at the cost of plunging stock prices. They're slashing dividends too as they fight crumbling oil prices. Even oil major Conoco Phillips (COP) pared its quarterly dividend in February from 74 cents per share to 25 cents per share.DHS has a 0.38% expense ratio. A solid RS Rating of 81 indicates that its recent price action tops 81% of the stocks and ETFs that IBD tracks.SPDR S&P Dividend (SDY) invests in companies with a consistent history of increasing dividends. Its tracks an index that requires stock holdings to have raised dividends for the past 20 straight years. There are cap-size and liquidity screens too.Stocks are weighted by annual dividend yield, which gives the fund a skew toward smaller-cap and value stocks.SDY holds $12.96 billion in assets. It has a 2.54% yield and a 0.35% expense ratio.Its RS Rating is a good but not great 75.ALPS Sector Dividend Dogs (SDOG) offers an alternative spin on the iconic S&P 500 index. It selects the five highest-yielding securities in each of the 10 sectors comprising that benchmark. It then equally weights both stocks and sectors to provide broad diversification while avoiding sector biases.SDOG follows the ""Dogs"" theory, which holds that high-yielding equities tend to appreciate faster than lower-yielding equities, according to industry monitor ETF.com. The portfolio has delivered both higher yields and lower market risk, ETF.com adds.The $1.03 billion ETF has a 0.40% expense ratio and a 3.57% yield. It has an RS Rating of 83.PowerShares S&P 500 High Dividend Low Volatility Portfolio (SPHD) is the fourth and final dividend ETF with a bolting RS line. It offers a very good 90 RS Rating.SPHD also invests in the S&P 500 while offering less risk and a big yield. It's been finding its way into investors' ETF strategies briskly in 2016.Year to date through March 16, DHS was up 6%, SDY 7%, SDOG 9% and SPHD 11%.Over the past three years, DHS produced an average annual gain of 11% vs. 12% for SDY, 13% for SDOG and 15% for SPHD.By comparison, SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) was down 0.3% year to date and averaged an 11% annual gain over the past three years.All four ETFs gained on the stock market today.

271,COP,"Moody's put Chevron (CVX) on review for a downgrade on expected negative free cash flow and changed Exxon Mobil's (XOM) debt rating outlook to negative, as lower capital reinvestment will likely haunt the oil major for the rest of the decade.The ratings agency predicts negative free cash flow this year and next at Chevron, according to a note from Pete Speer, Moody’s senior vice preesident. He thinks negative free cash flow could even continue until 2018.Last month Chevron cut its capital spending for this year by 25% vs. 2015, but Moody's sees negative free cash flow to exceeded $15 billion in 2016, despite the spending cut. Chevron had negative free cash flow of around $16 billion in 2015.Chevron shares closed down 1.1% in the stock market today as oil prices fell.Moody's changed Exxon's debt rating outlook to negative from stable on ""negative free cash flow and weak cash flow based leverage metrics for ExxonMobil in 2016 and 2017.""Exxon is also cutting capex this year and Speer thinks the ""diminished level of capital reinvestment could adversely affect Exxon's reserve replacement and production profile in the latter part of this decade.""Exxon shares dipped 0.3%.Moody's also downgraded ConocoPhillips' (COP), Marathon Oil's (MRO), Devon Energy's (DVN) and Apache's (APA) senior unsecured ratings with a negative outlooks late Thursday. It also cut ratings on EOG (EOG) and Occidental Petroleum (OXY), but sees a stable outlook.Conoco shares climbed 3.2%, Marathon leapt 8.7% and Devon Energy gained 3.7%. EOG dipped 1.5%. Occidental rose 0.2% and Apache shares climbed 4.45%.In January , Moody’s put 175 energy and mining companies, including Royal Dutch Shell’s (RDSA), BP (BP), Schlumberger (SLB) and U.S. shale firms, on review for potential credit downgrades, citing the deterioration of commodity prices and expected oil production increases from Iran.Later, Standard & Poor downgraded Shell’s and Chevron’s credit ratings and put  BP, Italy’s Eni (E), France’s Total (TOT) and Norway’s Statoil (STO) on notice for potential downgrades.Image provided by Shutterstock.

272,COP,"Oil markets will start to stabilize next year as industry production and spending fall, an International Energy Agency report said Monday, with U.S. shale producers seeing a near-term drop.U.S. output of shale oil, or light tight oil (LTO), is expected to drop by 600,000 barrels a day this year and another 200,000 a day next year. But IEA sees total U.S. production hitting a record high of 14.2 million barrels a day by 2021, helped by cost cuts and efficiencies.""Anybody who believes that we have seen the last of rising LTO production in the United States should think again,"" the IEA said.U.S. crude futures jumped 6.2% to $31.48 a barrel, and Brent crude rose 5.1% to $34.69, lifting shares of top oil companies. Chevron (CVX) climbed 2.7%, Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) 2.1% and BP (BP) 1.85%%, but Exxon Mobil (XOM) dipped 0.1%t.However, as oil companies continue to make cutbacks, the energy watchdog for top developed economies warned that ""the availability of resources that can be easily and quickly tapped will limit the scope of rallies -- at least in the near term.""“It is easy for consumers to be lulled into complacency by ample stocks and low prices today, but they should heed the writing on the wall: The historic investment cuts we are seeing raise the odds of unpleasant oil-security surprises in the not-too-distant-future,” IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol said in a statement.The U.S. oil rig count continued to fall last week, Baker Hughes (BHI) said, while the Energy Information Administration reported crude inventories rose.

(MRO), Antero Resources (AR) and Gulfport Energy (GPOR) all announced big spending cuts in recent days.And earlier, Exxon Mobil, Chevron and ConocoPhillips (COP) announced steep spending cuts.In addition to the U.S., Iran would be another expected leader in oil-production growth, according to IEA.With sanctions easing, Iran's production is seen hitting 3.9 million barrels a day by 2021.The IEA said 4.1 million barrels a day would be added the oil supply worldwide between 2015 and 2021, though that's well below 11 million barrels per day between 2009 and 2015.The report comes after Saudi Arabia, Russia, Qatar and Venezuela have agreed to freeze output at January's levels as long as they aren't the only nations to do so. But it was unclear whether Iran would join that agreement, and Nigeria's government said Iraq and Iran ought to have more flexibility to recover market share.“Countries like Iran and Iraq have been out of the market for a while and if they are to come back you shouldn’t freeze them out where they are, you should freeze them at a higher level,” Minister of State for Petroleum Resources Emmanuel Kachikwu said Sunday, according to Bloomberg.Saudi Oil Minister Ali al-Naimi is set to talk Tuesday at the IHS CERAWeek conference in Houston. Nigeria will also meet with the Saudi king on Tuesday, with plans to talk about propping up oil prices, Bloomberg said.Image provided by Shutterstock.

273,COP,"ConocoPhillips (COP) and other oil giants took a beating earlier this month when they reported grim quarterly results, and upcoming reports from top U.S. shale firms won't look any better.Unlike Exxon Mobil (XOM), Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) and other integrated oil majors, shale producers don't have downstream operations that benefit from cheap oil to help cushion profit during price slumps.Some shale firms have already reported. Cabot Oil & Gas (COG)  swung to a loss below analyst views as oil prices stay lower for longer. Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) posted a better-than-expected loss but cut its spending outlook just a month after offering more bullish guidance.Continental Resources (CLR) and other bellwether shale players are on tap in the coming week.Continental, Oasis Petroleum (OAS) and Concho Resources (CXO) are scheduled to report fourth-quarter results Wednesday.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters see Continental swinging to a quarterly loss of 21 cents per share from a per-share profit of $1.14 a year ago. Revenue is seen plunging 56.2% to $568.2 million.Last month, Continental guided 2016 capital spending to $920 million, down 66% from 2015. It also sees production falling during the year on lower drilling and well completion activity.Continental is one of the few large independent E&P companies that haven't issued a round of job cuts, and CEO Harold Hamm has predicted that oil could hit $60 per barrel by the end of the year.Analysts expect Oasis's quarterly EPS to plunge 83% to 6 cents. Revenue is seen falling 20.6% to $238 million.Wall Street sees Concho Resources' earnings tumbling 95.6% to 4 cents per share and revenue down 11.6% to $525.4 million.EOG Resources (EOG) reports Thursday. EOG is expected to swing to a 31 cent per-share loss down from a per-share profit of 79 cents. Revenue is expected to fall 53.2% to $525.4 million.

274,COP,"Is there such a thing as the comedy gene? James Burrows believes it so.Burrows is the most prolific sitcom director in the history of television. He recently directed his 1,000th episode, this one of his new series, ""Crowded,"" which sneak-previews March 15 on NBC and officially premieres March 21.Asked if his comedic skill set was nature or nurture, Burrows told IBD: “Probably nature. I don’t think you can learn how to be funny. I think you have to be born with that. And then it can be nurtured, but you have to have the gene.”Chuck Lorre, who created or co-created ""Cybill,"" ""Mom"" and ""The Big Bang Theory,"" concurs.“I’ve always believed good comedy had rhythm and pitch, tempo, rests, dynamics, all the things you normally associate with music,"" Lorre said. ""Jimmy hears those things. He hears the music.”Burrows' ability to hear the music has placed him in the director’s chairs of such iconic television shows as “Taxi,” “Cheers,” “Frasier,” “Friends” and “Will & Grace.” It has earned him 10 Emmy Awards and four Directors Guild of America honors.Figuring out the nature in the genetic makeup of Burrows, 75, is easy. His dad, Abe Burrows, was a humorist and radio personality, as well as a prize-winning playwright of theater classics such as “Guys and Dolls,” “Can-Can"" and “How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying.”It was a rapturous upbringing in New York City. Burrows recalls a New Year’s Eve party his dad threw that drew lyricists Betty Comden and Adolph Green, author Truman Capote and actor Danny Kaye.“I sat next to John Steinbeck, and he had in his breast pocket the (Pulitzer Prize) acceptance speech for 'The Grapes of Wrath,' ” Burrows said. “He was a little bit in his cups, and he read it to me.”When Burrows was around 13, his father “used to trundle me off to rehearsals (for his Broadway plays), and I used to sit there and watch.”And he absorbed. “I learned kindness from my father (when dealing with actors). And not being a martinet.”Abe provided something else: a job that turned out to be crucial in Jim's career.It came in 1966, when he worked on the production of the senior Burrows' book for the musical stage version of Capote's ""Breakfast at Tiffany's."" It starred TV personalities Mary Tyler Moore and Richard Chamberlain, so had $2 million advance sales, huge in those days, when orchestra seats topped off at about $12.The show opened in Philadelphia to poor notices. Before it moved to Boston, producer David Merrick canned Abe.In his place, Jim Burrows noted, Merrick hired “a man known for his musical comedy skills, Edward Albee to replace my dad. He asked me what I wanted to do, and I said I kind of wanted to stay.“I was the assistant to the assistant stage manager, but my real job was to be in charge of (Moore and Chamberlain) and make sure they were OK and taken care of. I was a gofer. Part of my job was to go down to Edward’s office each day and pick up new pages.”But not even Edward Albee jokes could sufficiently resuscitate the play. Merrick closed it after four New York City previews, but not before Burrows made an important connection -- to Moore.“The show was a disaster, and we were in the lifeboat together,” Burrows recalled. “And I kind of became friendly with Mary and (her husband) Grant Tinker. But I had no idea back then I would ever end up in television.”Meanwhile, Burrows continued working in theater, as a stage manager and director, mostly off-Broadway and in regional theater.“One night I turned on ‘The Mary Tyler Moore Show.' For some reason, it had never registered with me that they played before a live audience,"" he said. ""Here I was doing a two-hour play in a week, so I (figured a half-hour episode would be easy).”He contacted Moore and Tinker, who “knew of some of my exploits” since they’d met, particularly a directing stint in San Diego. A month later, they called and invited Burrows to Hollywood to direct an episode of the “Mary Tyler Moore Show.”That wasn’t necessarily a gift. It was a subpar script, but Burrows didn’t care. “When I started out, I wasn’t worried about my next job. I was going to do the best possible show I could do and let the cards fall where they may.”Recalling his dad’s kindness methodology, Burrows joked and cajoled strong performances out of the cast. “I did everything I could to make that show funny and work. I’m really good with movement and physicality. I invoked Chekhov and Stanislavsky, and the actors responded. That show had maybe a C- script, and I got it to be maybe a C show. Mary came over to me five minutes before we shot and said, ‘I think our investment in you has worked out.’ ”Burrows was quickly assigned by MTM Enterprises -- Moore and Tinker’s production company -- to direct sister shows, including “The Bob Newhart Show” and “Phyllis,"" and made the most of the opportunity.“Young directors always come to me and ask me questions,"" he said. ""(I tell them) getting your foot in the door is not the hardest thing to do. The hardest thing is to capitalize on the opportunity or be ready for the opportunity when you get your shot at directing. ... That’s the advice I give people: Be ready for when that opportunity happens.”Burrows brought all that he’d learned directing live theater to his TV: “You can’t just be a traffic cop (moving actors around). You have to bring something to the show.”Burrows must have brought a lot to his shows, which were consistent TV winners. “Taxi” ran five years. “Will & Grace” ran eight, mostly as a top-20 show. “Friends” ran a decade, all in the top-10 Nielsen ratings.Despite his early hits, he understood he had a lot to learn. He watched fellow MTM director Jay Sandrich’s use of cameras. Sitcoms typically used three cameras at the same time covering all the angles. Burrows would become an early proponent of four-camera shoots, which are common today.“Jay and I hit it off. He was very sweet and totally became my mentor.”Sandrich made sure Burrows was plugged in to more than just the technical side of directing.“He taught me the ethics of directing, what you can do, when to speak your piece and when not to,"" said Burrows. ""For example, when you go into an existing show -- as I did with ‘Mary Tyler Moore' -- after the precedents for how it works had already been set. Jay taught me how to get my input in and still play by existing rules.”The entertainment industry is ego-driven, and Burrow got it.""Before ‘Cheers,’ yes, (the egos) were always a problem for me, getting them to listen to me and pay attention,"" he said. ""In the beginning, I had to indulge the ego, make accommodations and understand there are times I’d have to yield to actors, because I had no cojones. Ever since ‘Cheers’ that changed.”“Cheers” was the first show Burrows created (with Les and Glen Charles). He directed 243 of the show’s 270 episodes from 1982 to 1993.And it was one of the greatest smash hits in TV history. ""Cheers"" ran 11 seasons, almost all as a top-10 show, and made stars of its cast members, especially Ted Danson, Kirstie Alley and Woody Harrelson.Burrows had his finger on the pulse of his talent: “Actors will test you. I always tell them 50% of what I say is great and 50% is garbage. It’s your job to figure out which is which.”To this day, he brings calm and confidence to the set. Recalls Lorre: “The first time I worked with Jimmy was on the ‘Dharma & Greg' pilot (in 1997). Even then he was an icon. He was The Man. I nervously asked him if he’d still be able to shoot a scene if we made a big change in the blocking. He looked at me and said, ‘Lorre, I got four cameras. I can shoot anything.’ It was a satori moment for me.”Burrows knows his strengths and is content where he is. He tried his hand at feature-length directing, with 1982 ""Partners""  starring John Hurt and Ryan O’Neal, and saw quickly the medium wasn't for him.“It turned out not to be very good,"" said Burrows. ""My brain doesn’t work that way. I’m not a cinematic guy. I’m a theater guy. For what I do, I need a live audience. Movies are not in my wheelhouse. I don’t enjoy doing the same scene three, four and more times.”And much like Thomas Wolfe, Burrows believes you can’t go home again. Which is why he's not excited about plans for shows he's never been involved in -- namely “Full House,” currently streaming, with a reboot of “Gilmore Girls"" in the works. “I don’t think you should ever go back,"" he said.""(Network executives have) talked to us (including the Charles Brothers) about a 'Cheers' reunion, but we don’t want to do one. We did that show. That was that show. I have no control over 'Friends.' David (Crane) and Marta (Kauffman) are the creators and geniuses behind that show. I don’t think they’ll ever want to do a reunion. It’s what it was, it was a treasure in the history of television, and I don’t think you want to revisit that,” he said.Burrows has been married to Debbie Easton since 1997 after a previous marriage to Linda Solomon. He has three daughters and a stepdaughter.Just how ubiquitous and influential Burrows has been can be seen in his answer to a question about his favorite episodes -- shows that many fans of TV comedy will recognize:“I have lots of children who are my favorites. Just a couple of them: Sam and Diane kissing at the end of the first year of 'Cheers'; Rev. Jim taking his driving test (in 'Taxi'); Woody’s wedding; David Schwimmer and the cat in 'Friends'; Will, Grace, Jack and Karen all in the shower together (in 'Will & Grace'); the first episode of '3rd Rock From the Sun' when these characters were first exposed to the earth. There are so many. The pilot of 'Frasier' is an extraordinary pilot.” Became the go-to guy for directing TV comedies.Overcame: Offered numerous choices, learning to pick the right oneLesson: Trust the writing, then figure out how to execute that vision.“The first thing that always appeals to me is good writing. To me, it’s always about the writing. Then the concept comes into play. Concepts are easy to come up with. The execution of the idea is hard. For example, ‘Cheers’ is a show about a bar and a Tracy-Hepburn relationship, which is not the greatest idea in the world, but it was the execution of the idea (that made it work).”

275,COP,"The number of oil rigs operating in the U.S. fell for the 14th time in 15 weeks, as top shale firms hold off on completing wells.Baker Hughes (BHI) said Friday that the rig count fell by 13 to 400 in the past week, the lowest level since December 2009 and down from a peak of 1,609 in October 2014.The number of natural gas rigs ticked up to 102 from 101, despite prices hitting a 17-year low during the week.Crude prices rallied for most of Friday as pipeline issues in Iraq and Nigeria are expected to keep 800,000 barrels temporarily off the market. But they reversed lower, with Brent futures closing down 0.5% at $35.10 a barrel and U.S. oil down 0.9% at $32.78.The oil bust and the collapse in drilling activity have hit oilfield service providers especially hard, with the pain continuing as prices stay lower for longer.On Thursday, Halliburton (HAL) said it would cut its workforce by another 8%, roughly 5,000 jobs. Since 2014, the company has slashed 22,000 employees, or 25% of its workforce. Halliburton also has been divesting assets to get European regulators to approve its acquisition of Baker Hughes.Rival Schlumberger (SLB) has laid off 34,000 workers, or 26% of its workforce, since the end of 2014, including 10,000 cuts in in the past quarter.Baker Hughes shares closed up 2.3% in the stock market today. Halliburton rose 0.95%. Schlumberger edged up 0.2%.The new round of  layoffs come as U.S. shale drillers stop completion activities in the massive Bakken shale formation.Late Wednesday, Continental Resources (CLR) said it stopped fracking operations in the Bakken. It already had planned to defer most completions in the North Dakota play in 2016.It has four operated drilling rigs in the North Dakota Bakken, with plans to maintain that level through the year, but said it has no stimulation crews deployed there.Also late Wednesday, Whiting Petroleum (WLL) said it will stop completing wells and cut its 2016 capital spending budget by 80% from 2015 to $500 million.Shale companies hope that by leaving wells drilled but not completed, they can bring back production quickly once oil prices rise. Fracking a well normally accounts for two-thirds of a well’s total production costs.While oil companies are trying to save money by operating fewer rigs and slashing budgets, their debt ratings are in jeopardy as lower revenue and investment will likely hurt companies for the next four years.Late Thursday, Moody's put Chevron (CVX) on review for a downgrade on expected negative free cash flow and changed Exxon Mobil’s (XOM) debt rating outlook to negative, as lower capital reinvestment will likely haunt the oil major for the rest of the decade.The ratings agency also downgraded ConocoPhillips’ (COP), Marathon Oil’s (MRO), Devon Energy’s (DVN) and Apache’s (APA) senior unsecured ratings with a negative outlooks late Thursday. It also cut ratings on EOG Resources (EOG) and Occidental Petroleum (OXY), but sees a stable outlook.Image provided by Shutterstock.

276,COP,"Anadarko Petroleum (APC) slashed its dividend by 81% on Tuesday as the company looks to boost its cash holdings, after ConocoPhillips (COP) cut its dividend by 66% last week.Anadarko, an oil exploration and production company, lowered its dividend to 5 cents per share from 27 cents per share.""We believe this adjustment to our dividend is the appropriate action to take in the current environment,"" said CEO Al Walker in a release.  ""On an annualized basis, this action provides approximately $450 million of additional cash available to enhance our operations and financial flexibility. Our Board will continue to evaluate the appropriate dividend on a quarterly basis.""Anadarko shares closed down 7% to 37.24 in the stock market today.Last week, Anadarko warned it might cut its dividend because its falling share price raised the yield too high.Also last week, ConocoPhillips cut its dividend to 25 cents from 74 cents -- its first dividend reduction since 1991. The move came just two months after the company said the “dividend remains the highest priority use of our cash.”Shares fell 2.5% to 33.58.Other dividends from oil and gas companies could be under pressure. Exxon Mobil (XOM)  has had to borrow money to fund dividend payments, and analysts speculate that BP (BP) could have trouble maintaining its payout if oil stays below $50 a barrel.Exxon shares dipped 1.3%. BP shares lost 3.2%.But Occidental Petroleum (OXY) President Vicki Hollub said earlier the company has no plans to cut its dividend and doesn’t “see a threat” to the dividend during the downturn in oil.Occidental shares dipped 1.4%.

279,COP,"Dividend ETFs have been on a roll in an unsteady stock market. Investors are betting on value companies with strong brands and stable businesses to ride out the volatility.They aren't just seeking quality, however. They're reaching for equity income as portfolio returns start to look anemic.ALPS Sector Dividend Dogs (SDOG) zoomed 8% higher in the past month through Feb. 22, outpacing virtually every peer in the U.S. dividend stock ETF category.By comparison, Vanguard Dividend Appreciation (VIG), the largest exchange traded fund in this group, rose 5%.SDOG yields 3.77% vs. 2.39% for VIG.Smart investors, however, make sure their reach doesn't exceed their grasp.Some of the highest-yielding dividend ETFs are loaded with energy stocks. The sector's a fount of attractive income, but bear in mind that yields have risen as share prices of oil and gas companies have fallen.Falling earnings makes those tasty dividends susceptible to big cuts.""Companies with more volatile cash flows and/or excessive leverage are more likely to cut their dividends in a downturn,"" Morningstar analyst Michael Rawson wrote in a July report.The oil patch offers solid proof.Kinder Morgan (KMI) slashed its dividend by 75% late last year amid the slump in oil prices.Anadarko Petroleum (APC) slashed its dividend by 81% earlier this month to boost its cash reserves. Anadarko, an oil exploration and production company, lowered its dividend to 5 cents per share from 27 cents per share.ConocoPhillips (COP) cut its dividend by 66% recently too -- two months after saying that the “dividend remains the highest priority use of our cash.”The question many are asking is: Could oil majors Exxon Mobil (XOM) and BP (BP) be next?Against this backdrop, ETF investors would be wise to look under the hood of their investment.VIG, an ETF focused on stocks that grow dividends, has a 1% exposure to the energy sector. That's hardly alarming.By comparison, SDOG allocates 10% of portfolio assets to the energy sector.Another high-yielding ETF, WisdomTree High Dividend (DHS) has a 15% energy weighting. DHS yields 3.63%.Even some ""core"" dividend ETFs may have a significant stake in energy.For iShares Core High Dividend (HDV), it's 21%. Exxon Mobil is its largest stock holding out of 75.For Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity (SCHD), it's 11%.

281,COP,"The stock action in Amazon.com mirrored the movement of the Nasdaq composite as the general market struggled to strike a clear direction in late-afternoon trading Thursday.The Nasdaq composite edged lower in declining trade amid a seesawing session in which the premier index was up as much as 0.9% in the early going. It's trying to stop a two-day slide in which it dropped more than 2.5% on Tuesday and Wednesday.The S&P 500 nursed a tiny decline, off 0.3%, while the Dow Jones industrials was practically flat amid rising turnover on the NYSE in the stock market today. However, in the Dow, industrial names continued to rebound. Caterpillar (CAT), United Technologies (UTX) and General Electric (GE) were each up 2% or more, with Caterpillar seeing volume running more than 70% above normal levels.Amazon (AMZN), down fractionally, continues to struggle since its Jan. 28 fourth-quarter results. The 122% leap in profit marked a third straight quarter of handsome profits, but it still missed inflated Wall Street views. The 22% jump in sales actually marked a slight deceleration in growth from 23% gains in Q3. Still, the 22% gain beats the six-quarter average revenue increase of 19.2%.The stock's tumble since Jan. 29 has pressed Amazon to a critical test of its 200-day moving average, a key level of long-term support. On Wednesday, Amazon touched that 200-day line for the first time since the stock began its strong run with a breakaway gap on Jan. 30, 2015, busting out past a 341.36 entry point within a long bottoming base. Yet, as a weekly stock chart shows, the e-commerce and video streaming giant's long-term uptrend remains intact.Amazon has fallen as much as 25% from its all-time high of 696.44. A typical cup with handle or double bottom among great stocks tends to show a decline in the 20% to 30% range. So, a 30% drop from Amazon's peak would theoretically send the stock down to as far as 487.51.Wall Street is highly bullish about Amazon's future growth; EPS is expected to soar 283% to 4.79 a share this year and 80% to $8.60 in 2017. In 2008, the start of the Great Recession, Amazon earned $1.49 a share. The stock's D in SMR Rating (as seen in IBD Stock Checkup) is the product of poor return on equity. Yet Amazon has been given special consideration by equity analysts due to its over-achievements in innovation and infrastructure spending. The long-term debt-to-equity ratio was 62% in 2015, suggesting it's managing its debt well.Pacific Crest analyst Brent Bracelin reportedly predicts that infrastructure-as-a-service revenue will triple in the next few years.Elsewhere, large oil firms continue to struggle in 2016. While ExxonMobil (XOM) is working on a second straight gain, up more than 1%, rival ConocoPhillips (COP) sank more than 8% in nearly four times typical volume. The global oil and gas explorer lost 90 cents a share in Q4, sharply missing views, and announced a huge cut in its quarterly dividend, from 74 cents a share to 25 cents. Revenue slumped 43% to $6.77 billion. The stock is nearly 50% below its 52-week peak.

284,COP,"Crude oil's price collapse of more than 70% since June 2014 is messing with Texas in a big way, as the latest data continue to show that plunging oil prices are battering the state's energy-focused manufacturing sector.The Dallas Federal Reserve's general business activity index fell to -34.6 in January, much worse than December's revised -21.6. The brutal score is the most negative since April 2009 during the last recession.The production index, which had been holding up in positive territory despite weak orders numbers, finally plunged into negative territory, falling nearly 23 points to -10.2. New orders and unfilled orders fell deeper into contraction. The employment index turned negative after positive readings in the prior two months.Texas is not only a big oil production state, it's home to many energy giants and hundreds of thousands of industry jobs. Exxon Mobil (XOM) is based in Dallas-area Irving. ConocoPhillips (COP) calls Houston home, along with oil service giants Halliburton (HAL), Schlumberger (SLB) and Baker Hughes (BHI).On Monday, Halliburton reported a sharp drop in Q4 earnings , though it stated reports of the death of U.S. shale oil companies are premature. Last week, Schlumberger said its Q4 EPS fell 57% and its quarterly revenue tumbled 39%. Baker Hughes, which Halliburton is trying to buy, reports Thursday morning. All three companies have slashed tens of thousands of jobs over the past year.Halliburton shares fell 3% on the stock market today. Schlumberger lost 2.9%, and Baker Hughes fell 6.8%. Exxon Mobil retreated 3.4%, and ConocoPhillips gave up 9.2%.Crude oil futures fell sharply after surging late last week. U.S. futures fell 5.8% to $30.34 a barrel, with prices falling back below $30 in late trading.A strong dollar, weak global economic performance and a historic collapse in oil prices have battered manufacturers across the country. The Empire State manufacturing index sank to recession-era lows in this month's report. The Philadelphia Fed's January index was in negative territory for the fifth straight month. The Richmond Fed issues its report Tuesday, followed by the Kansas City Fed's report on Thursday.

285,COP,"Schlumberger (SLB) earnings beat estimates late Thursday, and the oil-field service provider announced a $10 billion repurchase program.Fourth-quarter earnings plunged 57% to 65 cents per share. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters were expecting 63 cents. Revenue fell 39% to $7.7 billion, under views for $7.8 billion. North American revenue sank 55% to $1.95 billion, and international revenue fell 30% to $5.7 billion.The company forecast 2016 capital expenditures of $2.4 billion, even with 2015 spending.Shares climbed 1.3% in after-hours trading in the stock market today.During Q4, Schlumberger said that it had cut its workforce by 10,000 more employees as it looked to reduce overhead and infrastructure expenses. The company announced some job cuts in December ""in light of expected reduced activity for 2016"" but didn't give a number.Industry peers Halliburton (HAL) and Baker Hughes (BHI) have already slashed tens of thousands of jobs due to weak demand for their services as oil prices and U.S rig counts have fallen.Shares of Halliburton and Baker Hughes were unchanged in evening trading. Halliburton, which has a deal to buy Baker Hughes, is scheduled to announce quarterly results Monday.In addition to the $10 billion buyback, Schlumberger said that it will continue to issue its quarterly cash dividend of 50 cents per share. Despite oil prices staying lower for longer, oil majors like Chevron (CVX) and ConocoPhillips (COP) have vowed to keep their dividends.Also Thursday, the Energy Information Administration said that crude oil inventories for the week ended Jan. 15 rose by 4 million barrels, more than analysts expected.Follow Gillian Rich on Twitter @IBD_GRich.

310,COP,"Exxon Mobil (XOM) and BP (BP) cut their investment forecasts Tuesday, as the latest drop in oil prices adds pressure on energy giants to balance shareholder returns with a longer slump in crude.Exxon sees 2016 capital and exploration expenditures at $23.2 billion, down 25% from 2015, when spending fell 19% to $31.1 billion. Despite last year's cut, Exxon still had to borrow money to cover its dividend payments.Exxon shares closed down 2.2%, and BP sank 8.5%.Oil giants have vowed to protect their payouts even with crude prices more than 70% below highs reached in mid-2014. As their stock prices have followed oil lower, yields on their dividends have shot up.But relying on debt to fund dividends could get costlier. On Tuesday, Standard & Poor's put Exxon and ConocoPhillips (COP) on creditwatch negative while downgrading Chevron's (CVX) credit rating to AA- from AA.Exxon said it will suspend buybacks after slowing them toward the end of 2015. In the last 10 years, Exxon has spent $210 billion on buybacks, topping No. 2 repurchaser Microsoft (MSFT), which spent $125 billion, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices data.Meanwhile, BP CEO Bob Dudley told Bloomberg TV that to keep its dividend, the company can raise debt and boost its leverage ratio as high as 25%. In 2015, BP had a ratio of 21.6%.On Monday, S&P put BP, Italy’s Eni (E) France’s Total (TOT) and Norway’s Statoil (STO) on creditwatch negative, while lowering Royal Dutch Shell's (RDSA) debt rating.BP's dividend payout also would have to come from its balance sheet, Raymond James analyst Pavel Molchanov wrote in a research note. He doesn't expect a dividend cut this year, but if Brent stays below $50 per barrel by the end of the year, he thinks BP might have to. Exxon's dividend should be safe, he added.Brent crude fell 4.4% Tuesday to $32.72 a barrel. U.S. crude lost 5.5% to $29.88.BP's planned capex cut isn't as steep as Exxon's. BP sees 2016 organic capital expenditures to be at the lower end of its $17 billion-$19 billion outlook, after spending $18.7 billion in 2015. It also will cut another 3,000 jobs by the end of 2017.Other spending cuts are also more severe than BP's. Last week, Chevron said more layoffs are on the horizon as well as a further reduction in capital spending, after announcing in December a 24% reduction in its 2016 budget.U.S. shale producers, which don't have refining operations that benefit from cheap oil, are taking harsher measures.On Monday, Anadarko Petroleum (APC) said it will slash capex by 50% and added Tuesday that it may trim its dividend, noting the historically high yield. Last week, Continental Resources (CLR) said it would cut its 2016 spending budget by 66% to $920 million to save cash.Downstream operations, which include refining, helped offset some of the declines that Exxon and BP had in their upstream businesses, which include exploration and production.Exxon's downstream earnings more than doubled to $1.35 billion in Q4, while upstream profit plunged more than 80% to $857 million. Overall, earnings per share fell 57% to 67 cents, beating views of  63 cents. Revenue fell 31.5% to $59.8 billion, above views for $51.4 billion.BP's Q4 EPS sank 92% to 6 cents per share, missing views for 12 cents. Revenue dropped 34% to $49.2 billion, above views for $40.62 billion.

311,COP,"Islamophilia: President Obama is conferring legitimacy on a Baltimore mosque the FBI just a few years ago was monitoring as a breeding ground for terrorists, after arresting a member for plotting to blow up a federal building.IBD has learned that the FBI had been conducting surveillance at the Islamic Society of Baltimore since at least 2010 when it collared one of its members for plotting to bomb an Army recruiting center not far from the mosque in Catonsville, Md.Agents secretly recorded a number of conversations with a 25-year-old Muslim convert -- Antonio Martinez, aka Muhammad Hussain -- and other Muslims who worshipped there. According to the criminal complaint, Martinez said he knew “brothers” who could supply him weapons and propane tanks.“He indicated that if the military continued to kill their Muslim brothers and sisters, they would need to expand their operation by killing U.S. Army personnel where they live,” FBI special agent Keith Bender wrote. Martinez said that in studying the Quran he learned that Islam counsels Muslims to “fight those who fight against you.""Sentenced to 25 years in prison in 2012, Martinez also stated in a social media posting that he wanted to join the ranks of the “mujahideen” in “Pakistan or Afghanistan (a country that struggle[sic] for the sake of allah).” Most of ISB’s board members are from Pakistan.To help disrupt the plot, the FBI reportedly put an undercover agent in the mosque, which upset the leadership there. After protests, the FBI sent an official to ISB to take questions and mollify concerns the bureau was spying on Muslims.Members of the mosque complained that the FBI tried to “entrap” Martinez and other Muslim terrorism suspects by sending “spies with Muslim names” into the mosque.“If I was the president of the mosque, I would not let you come here without strip(-searching) you,” one member angrily told the FBI official, ""because you might drop something (like a bug) to hear what’s going on here.” “The Muslim Link"" newspaper described the questioner as Pakistani.This is the mosque that will be honored with a visit from Obama on Wednesday, the first U.S. mosque visit of his presidency.It’s now abundantly clear the White House failed to properly vet the venue. Reportedly, it let the Council on American-Islamic Relations choose the site, even though the FBI has banned CAIR from outreach because of known ties to the Hamas terrorist group.“For a number of years we’ve been encouraging the president to go to an American mosque,” CAIR spokesman Ibrahim Hooper said. “With the tremendous rise in anti-Muslim sentiment in our country, we believe that it will send a message of inclusion and mutual respect.”As we reported Tuesday, ISB is affiliated with the Islamic Society of North America -- which federal prosecutors in 2007 named a radical Muslim Brotherhood and Hamas front and an unindicted terrorist co-conspirator in a scheme to funnel more than $12 million to Hamas suicide bombers — and ISB has helped organize the terror-tied ISNA’s conferences.The Shariah-compliant mosque was led for 15 years by a radical cleric — Imam Mohamad Adam el-Sheikh — who once represented a federally designated al-Qaida front group. El-Sheikh also has argued for the legitimacy of suicide bombings, according to the Washington Post.We also first reported that ISB board member and vice president Muhammad Jameel has blamed American foreign policy — namely, U.S. support for Israel — for terrorism and the rise of Osama bin Laden.""I hope (his death) does not camouflage the bigger picture, which is to look at what gave rise to OBL and what are the root causes of terror,” Jameel said in a local 2011 interview. ""Just eliminating him does not resolve the longer-term problems, which I consider to be (U.S.) foreign policy.”ISB board members are required to have “an in-depth understanding of the Shariah,” and “must take Islam as the way of life,” according to recently amended articles of incorporation papers filed with the state of Maryland.We have also learned that ISB invited one of the imams of the Boston Marathon bombers’ mosque to headline a 2013 fundraiser for its Islamic school.Then-Islamic Society of Boston imam Suhaib Webb spoke at the 25th anniversary banquet of ISB's Al-Rahmah School -- even though two days before 9/11, according to an FBI surveillance report, Webb was raising cash for a Muslim cop-killer together with al-Qaida cleric Anwar Awlaki, the hijackers’ spiritual leader.So let’s recap. The mosque that is hosting the commander in chief, while receiving his historic benediction graduated a terrorist who plotted to blow up a local Army recruiting station, hired an imam who condoned suicide bombings and blames American “foreign policy” for terrorism.Obama has to be willfully blind not to see all these ties to terror.

312,COP,"The opinions expressed in this article by Matt Levine are his and not those of Bloomberg News.Blythe Masters' Digital Asset Holdings continues to make blockchain inroads, and I continue not to quite understand it. The latest is ""a trial project"" with JPMorgan, which is ""looking at several applications for the technology, including addressing liquidity mismatches in JPMorgan’s loan funds, which normally let investors take out their money at short notice -- even though the underlying assets can require much more time to sell."" People are worried about loan market liquidity, but they are soothing their worries with the blockchain.The traditional liquidity-mismatch worry is that you can take money out of a fund quickly, but it takes a longer time to find a buyer for the underlying assets at an acceptable price. This appears to address a slightly different worry, one of settlement timing: If you ask for your money back, and you get it in three days, and meanwhile JPMorgan was easily able to find a buyer for the underlying loan at a reasonable price, but it takes two weeks to settle that trade, then JPMorgan (JPM) is floating you money while it waits to get paid. Which is not optimal for JPMorgan. Still:Mr. Pinto said loans were a good place to start trialing blockchain technology, because “the settlement process is complex with lots of manual intervention and multiple parties.""See, this is the part I don't understand. If you think the blockchain is a better database than other databases, then replacing other databases with blockchains is a good idea. If your settlement process, for legal or customary or whatever reasons, requires lots of manual intervention from multiple parties, then just looking into a mirror and saying ""blockchain!"" three times won't solve that. You have to go to all those multiple parties and convince them to stop intervening manually. Once you've done that, sure, set up an electronic database. Maybe a blockchain, why not. But the problems here seem to be prior to the choice of database architecture. The last time we talked about Digital Asset, just over a week ago, it was because it had won a contract with the Australian Stock Exchange, and the explanation of why that was an ideal place to start trying out blockchain was the opposite of what it is here: Stock settlement in Australia is not a complex process with lots of manual intervention; it's a fully dematerialized stock market with a single centralized repository of stock information. It's just an electronic database, and Digital Asset thinks it has a better database.Meanwhile, bizarrely, ""a unit of Depository Trust & Clearing Corp., the dominant processor of repurchase agreements, or repos, between securities dealers, has told traders it will stop facilitating certain interbank repos as of July 15."" Specifically, dealers who clear through JPMorgan will no longer be able to do general collateral finance repos with dealers who clear through Bank of New York Mellon (BK). The problem seems to be a ... failure of databases?In an effort to align interdealer GCF trades and other repos, BNY, J.P. Morgan and DTCC set out to build new technology for swapping information about the cash and securities being exchanged between clients of the clearing banks.J.P. Morgan completed a series of enhancements, and the DTCC unit completed the majority of its own, but BNY determined that the technology work would have taken too much time and resources, people familiar with the situation said.If only JPMorgan had access to a magical kind of database that made clearing quick and easy while also somehow effortlessly solving interpersonal problems.""Chinese police have arrested more than 20 people associated with 'a complete Ponzi scheme' that allegedly took more than 50 billion yuan ($7.6 billion) from investors,"" and I like the rigor there in distinguishing ""a complete Ponzi scheme"" from, you know, a little bit Ponzi. Lots of semi-to-not-at-all-legitimate businesses have a bit of a Ponzi to them; if you're running a fraud anyway, sometimes you might have to take money from a new investor to pay an old investor to go away. But the Ponzi as a complete business model, especially in enormous size, is less common. This alleged full Ponzi was called Ezubao; it was (ostensibly) a peer-to-peer lending platform, and its ""risk controller, who is also under detention, was quoted by Xinhua as admitting that '95% of [our] projects are fake.' "" I guess that leaves 5% of not-Ponzi though.According to the SEC’s order instituting a settled administrative proceeding, QED Benchmark Management LLC and its founder/fund manager Peter Kuperman avoided disclosing heavy trading losses to investors by using a misleading mixture of hypothetical and actual returns when providing the fund’s performance history. After obtaining millions of dollars from investors based on these misrepresentations, QED Benchmark and Kuperman deviated from their stated investment strategy and poured most of the fund’s assets into a single penny stock.I would score this one as about zero percent Ponzi, but it's very odd. From the Securities and Exchange Commission order, it seems that QED Benchmark poured a bunch of money into stock and convertible debentures of a company called Emo Capital Corp. Emo's stock did not trade much. QED Benchmark kept marking up its holdings. Then the stock started falling. QED Benchmark negotiated a ""put option"" with Emo's promoters, under which QED Benchmark could sell the stock to the promoters at 72 cents, even though the market price was in the mid-40-cents. QED Benchmark paid nothing for this in-the-money put. ""The fund administrator accepted this document as evidence of the holdings’ value, and the fund’s statements to investors reflected a 72-cent valuation for the next six months."" After that, with the stock now down to 4.3 cents per share, ""Kuperman told the fund administrator that he and the put issuer would 'retire the existing March 72-cent put and replace it with (a) Dec. $1 put.' "" At this point, the administrator had had enough:So we are expected to believe that a third party would give you the right to sell nearly 4 million shares of a stock at $1 per share, even though its current price is roughly 4 cents per share, in exchange for absolutely nothing?The “put” had an intrinsic value of nearly $3.7 million and a third party sold it to you for zero?I don’t think so.Right on, administrator. Who was scamming whom, exactly, here? Kuperman agreed to reimburse his investors and pay $75,000 to the SEC.In other fraud news, Robert Bray was convicted of insider trading in a case that involved both golf and cocktail napkins:As the government proved at trial, in June 2010, Bray was tipped by a friend who was an executive at Boston-based Eastern Bank Corp. (“Eastern Bank”) that Wainwright would be acquired. The tip -- more than two weeks before the acquisition was publicly announced -- was passed on a napkin slipped to Bray over drinks at a country club bar in Watertown where both men are members. On Monday, June 14, 2010, Bray called his broker to ask how he could buy 25,000 shares of Wainwright stock, which he acknowledged “kinda sounds crazy,” given how thinly the stock traded.Turns out, it was. We discussed this case when Bray was charged in August 2014; it was the second insider trading case brought that summer at the same country club. There must be something in the water, or the cocktails, or the cocktail napkins.Also there is this:Last month, an undercover federal agent set up an account with Liberty Reserve, a virtual currency exchange based in Costa Rica. Registering online, the agent entered the name “Joe Bogus,” typed the account name as “tostealeverything,” and chose the address “123 Fake Main Street.”And:He transmitted hundreds of LR dollars between the Joe Bogus account and another undercover account, identifying one transaction as “your share of the cashout” and another “for the cocaine.”I am tempted to say ""if a user on your money-transfer site identifies a transaction as 'for the cocaine,' then he is a cop,"" but that's not right. That's how like half of transactions on Venmo are identified, and it never stops being hilarious. And I'm still writing dumb jokes in the ""memo"" field of my checks. But I like imagining these undercover FBI agents thinking hard about how real criminals would transfer money, and concluding that identifying the transfers as ""for the cocaine"" added exactly the right touch of verisimilitude.Ahh, millennials.Here's apparently an investing thesis?“People want to buy happiness,” Huang said at a London cafe in January. “An experience is unique because it gives them that in three stages: the anticipation, the event itself, and the memories after. Not only does that final stage last forever, but you can also share it.”The thesis that results from this is long companies that sell experiences (and happiness), short companies that sell goods. There is sort of a meta-thesis, though, which is that if the rising millennial generation is interested in authentic experiences and not the accumulation of wealth, won't that be bad for stock-market inflows? Anyway, in other news, ""the biggest 'robo-advisers' are relying on old-school call centers and blog posts to calm anxious investors, trying to persuade them that there is no need to abandon the algorithms in times of heightened volatility."" I hope the call center dialogue goes like this:YOU: I'm panicking, I tell ya, panicking! Sell everything!EERIE ROBOT VOICE: I'm sorry Dave, I'm afraid I can't do that.YOU: Who is Dave?Naked shorts.People get really mad about naked short selling, so much so that Gretchen Morgenson wrote a column about Goldman Sachs' (GS) naked-shorting settlement that ends with a quote from a guy who ... seems not to have read the settlement?In an interview, Mr. Shapiro, a former federal prosecutor and United States attorney, questioned the recent SEC settlement. “I’m very curious to understand what Goldman Sachs admitted to the SEC,” he said, “and why $15 million was considered to be an adequate punishment.”I mean, you can just read the settlement! (I wrote about it a couple of weeks ago.) Basically Goldman admitted that it used a dumb method for giving ""locates"" to clients that wanted to short stocks. This dumb method might, on the surface, look like it would allow an unacceptably large amount of naked shorting, but in fact it didn't -- ""Goldman’s rate of failures remained low and did not substantially change"" while it used the dumb method -- which might explain why $15 million was considered to be an adequate punishment.Elsewhere in market-structure-ish stuff, the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq ""are so upset the SEC didn’t offer either of them a seat on the agency’s Equity Market Structure Advisory Committee that they have spurned offers by the panel to participate in policy deliberations held by its members behind closed doors."" And my Bloomberg View colleague Michael Lewis has extremely odd ideas about Occupy Wall Street and IEX.Are bankers evil, etc.Here is Elizabeth Warren's report on ""Rigged Justice: 2016: How Weak Enforcement Lets Corporate Offenders Off Easy."" It includes the claim that the foreign-exchange fixing scandal involved banks who ""for more than five years manipulated exchange rates in a way that made the banks billions of dollars at the expense of clients and investors."" That seems like a wild overestimate to me: I think the absolute cap on revenue from FX fixing is under $2 billion, and I suspect it's orders of magnitude less. It strikes me as unproductive to assume that all bank scandals are the same size. Libor manipulation was big! Mortgage fraud was bigger! FX was sort of medium-size at worst.Here is a symposium at Concurring Opinions on the book ""Better Bankers, Better Banks."" Here is a story about how the outside monitor's report on HSBC (HSBC) will be made public. Here is ""Does Regulation Crowd out Private Ordering and Reputational Capital?"" And Maureen Sherry, a former managing director at Bear Stearns who wrote an opinion piece titled ""A Colleague Drank My Breast Milk and Other Wall Street Tales,"" has also written a novel about Wall Street, ""a breezy comedy in the style of 'Bridget Jones’s Diary'"":In a good year, Isabelle earns $3 million. Ms. Sherry said she considered how that would play to readers, but she wanted to be realistic. “I hate the term ‘Manhattan poor,’ ” she said, but added that after taxes, as a couple with one income and three private-school tuitions, “They weren’t living large.”People are worried about unicorns.""There were no U.S. IPOs in January, the first monthlong drought since September 2011,"" and people are worried about unicorns that might not be able to do initial public offerings:The fate of biotechnology companies is most in focus. While an IPO slowdown is problematic for all sorts of companies, including the technology sector in which dozens of companies have raised money privately at billion-dollar implied valuations, biotech is getting special scrutiny from investors because the sector is widely viewed as the most vulnerable to diminishing access to public funding.Elsewhere, this possibly parodic essay about ""How Soylent and Oculus Could Fix The Prison System"" (samples: ""I believe we could fix all of these problems using the Silicon Valley idea of 'first principles,' or boiling down a problem to its core and building a new solution from the ground up""; ""I’d outsource the laundry to FlyCleaners to save on facilities and admin""; ""You’d weigh in on a Fitbit Aria scale, so they could digitally track your weight alongside your other vitals"") should make you worry about unicorns. Meanwhile at Bloomberg Gadfly, Rani Molla asks how big Uber could get.People are worried about bond market liquidity.Start your week of worrying off right with ""'Seismic' shock awaits bond liquidity."" The particular shock involved here is the European Mifid II pre-trade transparency rules, which worry people:A senior executive at a large U.S. fund company, who requested anonymity, said: “Our head of fixed-income trading says that if he didn’t have young children, he would retire the day this comes in. It is not going to be pretty. It would undoubtedly affect liquidity.”The concern is that the rules will treat many illiquid bonds as liquid, require pre-trade transparency and firm quotes, and generally make it hard to negotiate trades.Things happen.

317,COP,"War On Cops: In case after case, jurors are siding with police over civil rights activists who have accused them of racially targeting young black men for murder. The Black Lives Matter movement is proving a fraud.The latest exoneration came Monday in Cleveland, where a grand jury refused to indict a white cop for shooting a black youth after he pulled a gun out of his waistband and threatened him with it.It was supposed to be a slam dunk case of a racially motivated police shooting. But newly enhanced surveillance video made it ""indisputably clear"" that the boy approached the cop, lifted his shirt and reached for the pellet gun, which was ""indistinguishable"" from a real gun.Before shooting, the officer yelled repeatedly, ""Show me your hands"" as loud as he could. But the boy refused to comply, brandishing the gun instead.The grand jury also learned that Tamir Rice appeared much older than 12. At 175 pounds and wearing size 12 shoes, he looked like a young man when the officer and his partner responded to a call of a ""guy with a pistol"" scaring people.Of course, that's not how Black Lives Matter protestors have portrayed the facts. They convinced the gullible media that the two racist patrolmen pulled up on an innocent little boy as he played with a toy in the park and gunned him down in cold blood. They demanded city officials charge the cops with murder.Jurors heard the actual facts in the case and concluded there was no reason for the cops to know that Rice was threatening them with a pellet gun and therefore had reason to fear for their lives. And they found no racial animus in the tragic shooting.The dismissal of the case follows a mistrial earlier this month in the first of several cases against police in Baltimore involving the death of another young black man, Freddie Gray.A majority black jury could not agree that Baltimore Police Officer William Porter was guilty of negligence in Gray's death while in custody. Porter's conviction was supposed to be a cinch. But the decision now throws the trials of five other cops into flux.In August, a jury in Charlotte, N.C., also made up of minorities, could not agree that Charlotte Police Officer Randall Kerrick was guilty of manslaughter in the shooting death of an unarmed black man, Jonathan Ferrell.Eight jurors, including minorities, argued for acquittal, believing Kerrick shot Ferrell in self- defense as Ferrell, a college football player under the influence, repeatedly charged at the rookie cop while responding to a report of a home invasion involving Ferrell.A grand jury initially declined to indict Kerrick, but after angry protests from the NAACP and Black Lives Matter, the case was presented to a different grand jury and eventually went to trial. Prosecutors decided not to retry Kerrick. For its rush to judgment, the city must pay the railroaded cop almost $200,000 in back pay, retirement and legal fees.Last year, moreover, jurors exonerated equally framed police involved in the deaths of two other black men — Michael Brown of Ferguson, Mo., and Eric Garner of Staten Island, N.Y. — and before that, a jury found a neighborhood crime watch captain acted in self-defense in the fatal shooting of Trayvon Martin, aka Obama's ""son,"" in Sanford, Fla.Six swings, six misses by the race-baiters and -mongers.None of these cases should ever have gone to trial, but riots and political pressure forced prosecutors' hands. Luckily, there are multiple layers to our judicial system, and mob justice can only go so far.These citizen jurors are in effect indicting Black Lives Matter as a fraudulent movement based on a false narrative of ""systemic racism"" and bogus charges of police abuse and brutality.They're also rendering judgment on Obama, who recently called BLM a ""legitimate"" cause and has launched an anti-discrimination witch hunt against more than two dozen police departments.

319,COP,"The new year is already shaping up to be a historic one for energy companies as the U.S. exported crude for the first time since the 1970s on Dec. 31, but low oil prices will continue to pressure smaller firms with weaker balance sheets.
"
320,COP,"In December, Magnum Hunter Resources filed for bankruptcy protection, and dozens of smaller producers have filed in 2015, with the pace likely to pick up this year.""Banks are going to clamp down and are not going to be as generous as in 2015,"" said Dan Guffey, VP of equity research at Stifel Nicolaus.The prospect of less financing from banks comes as energy companies rely less on the bond and equity markets to raise liquidity. And over-leveraged firms in particular will feel the squeeze, as oil is expected to stay lower for longer.In 2015, Brent crude hit an 11-year low, and U.S. prices fell to levels not seen since 2009. Even lower prices may be ahead.How Low Will Oil Go?JPMorgan analysts see oil staying lower for the first half of 2016 before rising in the second. Goldman Sachs and Citigroup have said oil could even hit $20 a barrel. Guffey forecasts oil at $35 to $45 per gallon.Tensions in the Middle East are increasing, potentially boosting oil prices. But the rapidly escalating rivalry between Iran and Saudi Arabia may sink any hopes that Saudi-led OPEC will make room for Iran's additional output and ease the global oil glut.U.S. producers were able to weather the low-price environment in 2015 by slashing costs, payrolls, drilling rigs and capital expenditure budgets. They also used new techniques on their most efficient, productive wells, keeping U.S. output more resilient than expected.But hunkering down for another year may prove difficult. Gains from drilling innovations, such as using higher sand concentrations and higher proppant volumes, are expected to slow this year, and costs have less room to drop.""We might be in the later innings of those efficiency gains as operators don't want to test in the lower oil price environment,"" Guffey said.U.S. Production To TumbleAfter a modest dip, oil production should see a steeper drop this year. The Energy Information Administration expects U.S. crude output to fall to an average of 8.76 million barrels a day in 2016 from 9.33 million barrels a day in 2015.Meanwhile, more budget cuts are on the horizon this year as well. Chevron (CVX) has said it plans to spend $26.6 billion in 2016, 24% less than in 2015. ConocoPhillips (COP) has said capital expenditures will fall to $7.7 billion in 2016, down 25% from 2015 and 55% from 2014.The big, integrated oil majors are also reluctant to pay for companies or oilfields that aren't top quality, and stable U.S. shale producers are hesitant to spend cash on assets that might not be drilled for years from struggling small firms.So the wave of industry consolidation that was expected when oil prices initially sank hasn't happened yet, though Noble Energy's (NBL) $2 billion purchase of Rosetta Resources and Royal Dutch Shell's (RDSA) $70 billion deal for BG Group were among the few that stood out in 2015. But private equity firms could be interested in smaller oil companies, Guffey said.A mega-merger in oilfield services may be clinched in early 2016. While regulators have been skeptical of Halliburton 's (HAL) $35 billion acquisition of Baker Hughes (BHI), discussions with the Justice Department continue, and the companies extended their deadline to April.Amid the gloom of U.S. oil prices at recession-era lows, producers were able to score at least one victory in 2015: ending the ban on exports of U.S. crude.The first crude shipment left Texas on Dec. 31, on its way for the Vitol Group, a Dutch oil-trading firm, according to ConocoPhillips and NuStar Energy (NS).That comes ahead of Iran's expected return to world oil markets, as economic sanctions over its nuclear program could be lifted this month. Tehran has said it can double oil production to 1 million barrels per day in 2016.Hopes are high that opening up export markets for U.S. shale firms will prop up drilling activity and bring back some jobs. Lawmakers also see it as a political weapon.Saudi Arabia, the world's top oil exporter, is already paying the price for cheap prices and sees a $98 billion budget deficit for 2015 and $86.86 billion in 2016, as it derives 90% of its fiscal revenue from oil. Saudi Arabia will now face more U.S. competition.""Having the oil export ban lifted permanently is like having 100 Keystone pipelines, and it's really good for foreign policy. . .. It helps us put OPEC out of business,"" House Speaker Paul Ryan said during a Dec. 21 interview on ""The Hugh Hewitt Show."" ""It's not good for Venezuela, the Middle East, Russia and others.""

The crude, from the Eagle Ford Shale Play, is being loaded at NuStar's North Beach Terminal in the port of Corpus Christi, Texas.Barring any hangups, the two firms will be ahead of Enterprise Products Partners (EPD), which said it would load the first cargo of U.S. crude during the first week of January.ConocoPhillips shares edged up 0.2% to close at 46.69 in the stock market today. NuStar Energy shares jumped nearly 7%. Enterprise Products rose 2.7%.The U.S. ban was lifted Dec. 18 as part of the 2016 spending bill. Shale producers have long argued the ban is outdated. Since oil prices have plunged, they also say allowing exports would help support continued drilling activity. Economists, including those at the Energy Department, contend lifting the ban would help the economy and could even lower gasoline prices.U.S. crude futures rose 1.2% to $37.04 a barrel on Thursday, but fell 2.8% for the week. Oil prices fell 30% for 2015 after diving 45% in 2014.The ban started in the 1970s as an attempt to protect Americans from price spikes, some of which were caused by Middle Eastern countries using oil as a political weapon.Also Thursday, Baker Hughes (BHI) said the U.S. oil rig count fell by 2 to 536 during the past week.Follow Gillian Rich on Twitter @IBD_GRich.

331,COP,"Full text of the Barack Obama State of the Union AddressMr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, my fellow Americans: Tonight marks the eighth year I’ve come here to report on the State of the Union.  And for this final one, I’m going to try to make it shorter.  I know some of you are antsy to get back to Iowa.I also understand that because it’s an election season, expectations for what we’ll achieve this year are low.  Still, Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the constructive approach you and the other leaders took at the end of last year to pass a budget and make tax cuts permanent for working families.  So I hope we can work together this year on bipartisan priorities like criminal justice reform, and helping people who are battling prescription drug abuse. We just might surprise the cynics again. (Scroll down for C-SPAN video of this speech.)But tonight, I want to go easy on the traditional list of proposals for the year ahead. Don’t worry, I’ve got plenty, from helping students learn to write computer code to personalizing medical treatments for patients.  And I’ll keep pushing for progress on the work that still needs doing.  Fixing a broken immigration system.  Protecting our kids from gun violence.  Equal pay for equal work, paid leave, raising the minimum wage.  All these things still matter to hardworking families; they are still the right thing to do; and I will not let up until they get done.But for my final address to this chamber, I don’t want to talk just about the next year.  I want to focus on the next five years, ten years, and beyond.I want to focus on our future.We live in a time of extraordinary change — change that’s reshaping the way we live, the way we work, our planet and our place in the world.  It’s change that promises amazing medical breakthroughs, but also economic disruptions that strain working families.  It promises education for girls in the most remote villages, but also connects terrorists plotting an ocean away.  It’s change that can broaden opportunity, or widen inequality.  And whether we like it or not, the pace of this change will only accelerate.America has been through big changes before — wars and depression, the influx of immigrants, workers fighting for a fair deal, and movements to expand civil rights.  Each time, there have been those who told us to fear the future; who claimed we could slam the brakes on change, promising to restore past glory if we just got some group or idea that was threatening America under control.And each time, we overcame those fears.  We did not, in the words of Lincoln, adhere to the “dogmas of the quiet past.”  Instead we thought anew, and acted anew.  We made change work for us, always extending America’s promise outward, to the next frontier, to more and more people.  And because we did — because we saw opportunity where others saw only peril — we emerged stronger and better than before.What was true then can be true now.  Our unique strengths as a nation — our optimism and work ethic, our spirit of discovery and innovation, our diversity and commitment to the rule of law — these things give us everything we need to ensure prosperity and security for generations to come.In fact, it’s that spirit that made the progress of these past seven years possible.  It’s how we recovered from the worst economic crisis in generations.  It’s how we reformed our health care system, and reinvented our energy sector; how we delivered more care and benefits to our troops and veterans, and how we secured the freedom in every state to marry the person we love.But such progress is not inevitable.  It is the result of choices we make together.  And we face such choices right now.  Will we respond to the changes of our time with fear, turning inward as a nation, and turning against each other as a people?  Or will we face the future with confidence in who we are, what we stand for, and the incredible things we can do together?So let’s talk about the future, and four big questions that we as a country have to answer — regardless of who the next President is, or who controls the next Congress.First, how do we give everyone a fair shot at opportunity and security in this new economy?Second, how do we make technology work for us, and not against us — especially when it comes to solving urgent challenges like climate change?Third, how do we keep America safe and lead the world without becoming its policeman?And finally, how can we make our politics reflect what’s best in us, and not what’s worst?Let me start with the economy, and a basic fact: the United States of America, right now, has the........strongest, most durable economy in the world.  We’re in the middle of the longest streak of private-sector job creation in history.  More than 14 million new jobs; the strongest two years of job growth since the ‘90s; an unemployment rate cut in half. Our auto industry just had its best year ever.  Manufacturing has created nearly 900,000 new jobs in the past six years.  And we’ve done all this while cutting our deficits by almost three-quarters.Anyone claiming that America’s economy is in decline is peddling fiction.  What is true — and the reason that a lot of Americans feel anxious — is that the economy has been changing in profound ways, changes that started long before the Great Recession hit and haven’t let up. Today, technology doesn’t just replace jobs on the assembly line, but any job where work can be automated.  Companies in a global economy can locate anywhere, and face tougher competition.  As a result, workers have less leverage for a raise.  Companies have less loyalty to their communities.  And more and more wealth and income is concentrated at the very top.All these trends have squeezed workers, even when they have jobs; even when the economy is growing.  It’s made it harder for a hardworking family to pull itself out of poverty, harder for young people to start on their careers, and tougher for workers to retire when they want to.  And although none of these trends are unique to America, they do offend our uniquely American belief that everybody who works hard should get a fair shot.For the past seven years, our goal has been a growing economy that works better for everybody.  We’ve made progress.  But we need to make more.  And despite all the political arguments we’ve had these past few years, there are some areas where Americans broadly agree.We agree that real opportunity requires every American to get the education and training they need to land a good-paying job.  The bipartisan reform of No Child Left Behind was an important start, and together, we’ve increased early childhood education, lifted high school graduation rates to new highs, and boosted graduates in fields like engineering.  In the coming years, we should build on that progress, by providing Pre-K for all, offering every student the hands-on computer science and math classes that make them job-ready on day one, and we should recruit and support more great teachers for our kids.And we have to make college affordable for every American. Because no......===============================================RELATED STORIES:Why won't Obama let Americans compete?In his final act, Obama makes Clint Eastwood's dayThe Obamas' $70 million vacation getaways you pay forLand mines along Hillary Clinton's path to the White HouseThe State Department's deceitful cover-up for Hillary===================================================........hardworking student should be stuck in the red. We've already reduced student loan payments to ten percent of a borrower's income. Now, we've actually got to cut the cost of college. Providing two years of community college at no cost for every responsible student is one of the best ways to do that, and I'm going to keep fighting to get that started this year.Of course, a great education isn’t all we need in this new economy. We also need benefits and protections that provide a basic measure of security. After all, it’s not much of a stretch to say that some of the only people in America who are going to work the same job, in the same place, with a health and retirement package, for 30 years, are sitting in this chamber.For everyone else, especially folks in their forties and fifties, saving for retirement or bouncing back from job loss has gotten a lot tougher.  Americans understand that at some point in their careers, they may have to retool and retrain.  But they shouldn’t lose what they’ve already worked so hard to build.That’s why Social Security and Medicare are more important than ever; we shouldn’t weaken them, we should strengthen them.  And for Americans short of retirement, basic benefits should be just as mobile as everything else is today.  That’s what the Affordable Care Act is all about.  It’s about filling the gaps in employer-based care so that when we lose a job, or go back to school, or start that new business, we’ll still have coverage.  Nearly eighteen million have gained coverage so far.  Health care inflation has slowed.  And our businesses have created jobs every single month since it became law.Now, I’m guessing we won’t agree on health care anytime soon.  But there should be other ways both parties can improve economic security.  Say a hardworking American loses his job — we shouldn’t just make sure he can get unemployment insurance; we should make sure that program encourages him to retrain for a business that’s ready to hire him.  If that new job doesn’t pay as much, there should be a system of wage insurance in place so that he can still pay his bills.  And even if he’s going from job to job, he should still be able to save for retirement and take his savings with him.  That’s the way we make the new economy work better for everyone.I also know Speaker Ryan has talked about his interest in tackling poverty. America is about giving everybody willing to work a hand up, and I’d welcome a serious discussion about strategies we can all support, like expanding tax cuts for low-income workers without kids.But there are other areas where it’s been more difficult to find agreement over the last seven years — namely what role the government should play in making sure the system’s not rigged in favor of the wealthiest and biggest corporations.  And here, the American people have a choice to make.I believe a thriving private sector is the lifeblood of our economy. I think there are outdated regulations that need to be changed, and there’s red tape that needs to be cut. But after years of record corporate profits, working families won’t get more opportunity or bigger paychecks by letting big banks or big oil or hedge funds make their own rules at the expense of everyone else; or by allowing attacks on collective bargaining to go unanswered.Food Stamp recipients didn’t cause the financial crisis; recklessness on Wall Street did.  Immigrants aren’t the reason wages haven’t gone up enough; those decisions are made in the boardrooms that too often put quarterly earnings over long-term returns.  It’s sure not the average family watching tonight that avoids paying taxes through offshore accounts.In this new economy, workers and start-ups and small businesses need more of a voice, not less.  The rules should work for them.  And this year I plan to lift up the many businesses who’ve figured out that doing right by their workers ends up being good for their shareholders, their customers, and their communities, so that we can spread those best practices across America.In fact, many of our best corporate citizens are also our most creative.  This brings me to the second big question we have to answer as a country:  how do we reignite that spirit of innovation to meet our biggest challenges?Sixty years ago, when the Russians beat us into space, we didn’t deny Sputnik was up there.  We didn’t argue about the science, or shrink our research and development budget.  We built a space program almost overnight, and twelve years later, we were walking on the moon.That spirit of discovery is in our DNA.  We’re Thomas Edison and the Wright Brothers and George Washington Carver.  We’re Grace Hopper and Katherine Johnson and Sally Ride.  We’re every immigrant and entrepreneur from Boston to Austin to Silicon Valley racing to shape a better world.  And over the past seven years, we’ve nurtured that spirit.We’ve protected an open internet, and taken bold new steps to get more students and low-income Americans online.  We’ve launched next-generation manufacturing hubs, and online tools that give an entrepreneur everything he or she needs to start a business in a single day.But we can do so much more.  Last year, Vice President Biden said........====================================================Look, if anybody still wants to dispute the science around climate change, have at it. You’ll be pretty lonely, because you’ll be debating our military, most of America’s business leaders, the majority of the American people, almost the entire scientific community, and 200 nations around the world.=====================================================........that with a new moonshot, America can cure cancer.  Last month, he worked with this Congress to give scientists at the National Institutes of Health the strongest resources they’ve had in over a decade. Tonight, I’m announcing a new national effort to get it done.  And because he’s gone to the mat for all of us, on so many issues over the past forty years, I’m putting Joe in charge of Mission Control.  For the loved ones we’ve all lost, for the family we can still save, let’s make America the country that cures cancer once and for all.Medical research is critical.  We need the same level of commitment when it comes to developing clean energy sources. Look, if anybody still wants to dispute the science around climate change, have at it.  You’ll be pretty lonely, because you’ll be debating our military, most of America’s business leaders, the majority of the American people, almost the entire scientific community, and 200 nations around the world who agree it’s a problem and intend to solve it.But even if the planet wasn’t at stake; even if 2014 wasn’t the warmest year on record — until 2015 turned out even hotter — why would we want to pass up the chance for American businesses to produce and sell the energy of the future?Seven years ago, we made the single biggest investment in clean energy in our history.  Here are the results.  In fields from Iowa to Texas, wind power is now cheaper than dirtier, conventional power.  On rooftops from Arizona to New York, solar is saving Americans tens of millions of dollars a year on their energy bills, and employs more Americans than coal — in jobs that pay better than average. We’re taking steps to give homeowners the freedom to generate and store their own energy — something environmentalists and Tea Partiers have teamed up to support.  Meanwhile, we’ve cut our imports of foreign oil by nearly sixty percent, and cut carbon pollution more than any other country on Earth.Gas under two bucks a gallon ain’t bad, either. Now we’ve got to accelerate the transition away from dirty energy. Rather than subsidize the past, we should invest in the future — especially in communities that rely on fossil fuels.  That’s why I’m going to push to change the way we manage our oil and coal resources, so that they better reflect the costs they impose on taxpayers and our planet.  That way, we put money back into those communities and put tens of thousands of Americans to work building a 21st century transportation system.None of this will happen overnight, and yes, there are plenty of entrenched interests who want to protect the status quo.  But the jobs we’ll create, the money we’ll save, and the planet we’ll preserve — that’s the kind of future our kids and grandkids deserve.Climate change is just one of many issues where our security is linked to the rest of the world. And that’s why the third big question we have to answer is how to keep America safe and strong without either isolating ourselves or trying to nation-build everywhere there’s a problem.I told you earlier all the talk of America’s economic decline is political hot air. Well, so is all........=====================================================
"
332,COP,"We’ve got to accelerate the transition away from dirty energy. Rather than subsidize the past, we should invest in the future — especially in communities that rely on fossil fuels. =====================================================........the rhetoric you hear about our enemies getting stronger and America getting weaker.  The United States of America is the most powerful nation on Earth.  Period.  It’s not even close.  We spend more on our military than the next eight nations combined.  Our troops are the finest fighting force in the history of the world.  No nation dares to attack us or our allies because they know that’s the path to ruin.  Surveys show our standing around the world is higher than when I was elected to this office, and when it comes to every important international issue, people of the world do not look to Beijing or Moscow to lead — they call us.As someone who begins every day with an intelligence briefing, I know this is a dangerous time. But that’s not because of diminished American strength or some looming superpower. In today’s world, we’re threatened less by evil empires and more by failing states.The Middle East is going through a transformation that will play out for a generation, rooted in conflicts that date back millennia.  Economic headwinds blow from a Chinese economy in transition.  Even as their economy contracts, Russia is pouring resources to prop up Ukraine and Syria — states they see slipping away from their orbit.  And the international system we built after World War II is now struggling to keep pace with this new reality.It’s up to us to help remake that system.  And that means we have to set priorities.Priority number one is protecting the American people and going after terrorist networks.  Both al Qaeda and now ISIL pose a direct threat to our people, because in today’s world, even a handful of terrorists who place no value on human life, including their own, can do a lot of damage.  They use the Internet to poison the minds of individuals inside our country; they undermine our allies. But as we focus on destroying ISIL, over-the-top claims that this is World War III just play into their hands.Masses of fighters on the back of pickup trucks and twisted souls plotting in apartments or garages pose an enormous danger to civilians and must be stopped.  But they do not threaten our national existence.  That’s the story ISIL wants to tell; that’s the kind of propaganda they use to recruit.We don’t need to build them up to show that we’re serious, nor do we need to push away vital allies in this fight by echoing the lie that ISIL is representative of one of the world’s largest religions.  We just need to call them what they are — killers and fanatics who have to be rooted out, hunted down, and destroyed.That’s exactly what we are doing. For more than a year, America has led a coalition of more than 60 countries to cut off ISIL’s financing, disrupt their plots, stop the flow of terrorist fighters, and stamp out their vicious ideology. With nearly 10,000 air strikes, we are taking out their leadership, their oil, their training camps, and their weapons.  We are training, arming, and supporting forces who are steadily reclaiming territory in Iraq and Syria.If this Congress is serious about winning this war, and wants to send a message to our troops and the world, you should finally authorize the use of........===============================================Even without ISIL, instability will continue for decades in many parts of the world — in the Middle East, in Afghanistan and Pakistan, in parts of Central America, Africa and Asia. Some of these places may become safe havens for new terrorist networks.===============================================........military force against ISIL.; Take a vote.  But the American people should know that with or without Congressional action, ISIL will learn the same lessons as terrorists before them.  If you doubt America’s commitment — or mine — to see that justice is done, ask Osama bin Laden.  Ask the leader of al Qaeda in Yemen, who was taken out last year, or the perpetrator of the Benghazi attacks, who sits in a prison cell.When you come after Americans, we go after you. It may take time, but we have long memories, and our reach has no limit. Our foreign policy must be focused on the threat from ISIL and al Qaeda, but it can’t stop there. For even without ISIL, instability will continue for decades in many parts of the world — in the Middle East, in Afghanistan and Pakistan, in parts of Central America, Africa and Asia.Some of these places may become safe havens for new terrorist networks; others will fall victim to ethnic conflict, or famine, feeding the next wave of refugees. The world will look to us to help solve these problems, and our answer needs to be more than tough talk or calls to carpet bomb civilians.  That may work as a TV sound bite, but it doesn’t pass muster on the world stage.We also can’t try to take over and rebuild every country that falls into crisis.  That’s not leadership; that’s a recipe for quagmire, spilling American blood and treasure that ultimately weakens us.  It’s the lesson of Vietnam, of Iraq — and we should have learned it by now.Fortunately, there’s a smarter approach, a patient and disciplined strategy that uses every element of our national power. It says America will always act, alone if necessary, to protect our people and our allies; but on issues of global concern, we will mobilize the world to work with us, and make sure other countries pull their own weight. That’s our approach to conflicts like Syria, where we’re partnering with local forces and leading international efforts to help that broken society pursue a lasting peace.That’s how we forged a Trans-Pacific Partnership to open markets, protect workers and the environment, and advance American leadership in Asia.  It cuts 18,000 taxes on products Made in America, and supports more good jobs.  With TPP, China doesn’t set the rules in that region, we do.  You want to show our strength in this century? Approve this agreement.  Give us the tools to enforce it.Fifty years of isolating Cuba had failed to promote democracy, setting us back in Latin America. That’s why we restored diplomatic relations, opened the door to travel and commerce, and positioned ourselves to improve the lives of the Cuban people.  You want to consolidate our leadership and credibility in the hemisphere?  Recognize that the Cold War is over.  Lift the embargo.American leadership in the 21st century is not a choice between ignoring the rest of the world — except when we kill terrorists; or occupying and rebuilding whatever society is unraveling.  Leadership means a wise application of military power, and rallying the world behind causes that are right.It means seeing our foreign assistance as part of our national security, not charity.When we lead nearly 200 nations to the most ambitious agreement in history to fight climate change — that helps vulnerable countries, but it also protects our children.  When we help Ukraine defend its democracy, or Colombia resolve a decades-long war, that strengthens the international order we depend upon.When we help African countries feed their people and care for the sick, that prevents the next pandemic from reaching our shores.  Right now, we are on track to end the scourge of HIV/AIDS, and we have the capacity to accomplish the same thing with malaria — something I’ll be pushing this Congress to fund this year.That’s strength.  That’s leadership.  And that kind of leadership depends on the power of our example.  That is why I will keep working to shut down the prison at Guantanamo:  it’s expensive, it’s unnecessary, and it only serves as a recruitment brochure for our enemies.That’s why we need to reject any politics that targets people because of race or religion.  This isn’t a matter of political correctness. It’s a matter of understanding what makes us strong.  The world respects us not just for our arsenal; it respects us for our diversity and our openness and the way we respect every faith.  His Holiness, Pope Francis, told this body from the very spot I stand tonight that “to imitate the hatred and violence of tyrants and murderers is the best way to take their place.”When politicians insult Muslims, when a mosque is vandalized, or a kid bullied, that doesn’t make us safer.  That’s not telling it like it is.  It’s just wrong.  It diminishes us in the eyes of the world.  It makes it harder to achieve our goals.  And it betrays who we are as a country.“We the People.”  Our Constitution begins with those three simple words, words we’ve come to recognize mean all the people, not just some; words that insist we rise and fall together.  That brings me to the fourth, and maybe the most important thing I want to say tonight.The future we want — opportunity and security for our families; a rising standard of living and a sustainable, peaceful planet for our kids — all that is within our reach.  But it will only happen if we work together. It will only happen if we can have rational, constructive debates.It will only happen if we fix our politics.A better politics doesn’t mean we have to agree on everything.  This is a big country, with different regions and attitudes and interests.  That’s one of our strengths, too.  Our Founders distributed power between states and branches of government, and expected us to argue, just as they did, over the size and shape of government, over commerce and foreign relations, over the meaning of liberty and the imperatives of security.But democracy does require basic bonds of trust between its citizens.  It doesn’t work if we think the people who disagree with us are all motivated by malice, or that our political opponents are unpatriotic.  Democracy grinds to a halt without a willingness to compromise; or when even basic facts are contested, and we listen only to those who agree with us.  Our public life withers when only the most extreme voices get attention.Most of all, democracy breaks down when the average person feels........====================================================It’s one of the few regrets of my presidency — that the rancor and suspicion between the parties has gotten worse instead of better.  There’s no doubt a president with the gifts of Lincoln or Roosevelt might have better bridged the divide.====================================================........their voice doesn’t matter; that the system is rigged in favor of the rich or the powerful or some narrow interest. Too many Americans feel that way right now.  It’s one of the few regrets of my presidency — that the rancor and suspicion between the parties has gotten worse instead of better.  There’s no doubt a president with the gifts of Lincoln or Roosevelt might have better bridged the divide, and I guarantee I’ll keep trying to be better so long as I hold this office.But, my fellow Americans, this cannot be my task — or any President’s — alone.  There are a whole lot of folks in this chamber who would like to see more cooperation, a more elevated debate in Washington, but feel trapped by the demands of getting elected.  I know; you’ve told me.  And if we want a better politics, it’s not enough to just change a Congressman or a Senator or even a President; we have to change the system to reflect our better selves.We have to end the practice of drawing our congressional districts so that politicians can pick their voters, and not the other way around.  We have to reduce the influence of money in our politics, so that a handful of families and hidden interests can’t bankroll our elections — and if our existing approach to campaign finance can’t pass muster in the courts, we need to work together to find a real solution.  We’ve got to make voting easier, not harder, and modernize it for the way we live now.  And over the course of this year, I intend to travel the country to push for reforms that do.But I can’t do these things on my own.  Changes in our political process — in not just who gets elected but how they get elected — that will only happen when the American people demand it.  It will depend on you.  That’s what’s meant by a government of, by, and for the people.What I’m asking for is hard.  It’s easier to be cynical; to accept that change isn’t possible, and politics is hopeless, and to believe that our voices and actions don’t matter.  But if we give up now, then we forsake a better future.  Those with money and power will gain greater control over the decisions that could send a young soldier to war, or allow another economic disaster, or roll back the equal rights and voting rights that generations of Americans have fought, even died, to secure.As frustration grows, there will be voices urging us to fall back into tribes, to scapegoat fellow citizens who don’t look like us, or pray like us, or vote like we do, or share the same background.We can’t afford to go down that path.  It won’t deliver the economy we want, or the security we want, but most of all, it contradicts everything that makes us the envy of the world.So, my fellow Americans, whatever you may believe, whether you prefer one party or no party, our collective future depends on your willingness to uphold your obligations as a citizen.  To vote.  To speak out.  To stand up for others, especially the weak, especially the vulnerable, knowing that each of us is only here because somebody, somewhere, stood up for us.  To stay active in our public life so it reflects the goodness and decency and optimism that I see in the American people every single day.It won’t be easy.  Our brand of democracy is hard.  But I can promise that a year from now, when I no longer hold this office, I’ll be right there with you as a citizen — inspired by those voices of fairness and vision, of grit and good humor and kindness that have helped America travel so far.  Voices that help us see ourselves not first and foremost as black or white or Asian or Latino, not as gay or straight, immigrant or native born; not as Democrats or Republicans, but as Americans first, bound by a common creed. Voices Dr. King believed would have the final word — voices of unarmed truth and unconditional love.They’re out there, those voices.  They don’t get a lot of attention, nor do they seek it, but they are busy doing the work this country needs doing.I see it in the worker on the assembly line who clocked extra shifts to keep his company open, and the boss who pays him higher wages to keep him on board.I see it in the Dreamer who stays up late to finish her science project, and the teacher who comes in early because he knows she might someday cure a disease.see it in the American who served his time, and dreams of starting over — and the business owner who gives him that second chance.  The protester determined to prove that justice matters, and the young cop walking the beat, treating everybody with respect, doing the brave, quiet work of keeping us safe.I see it in the soldier who gives almost everything to save his brothers, the nurse who tends to him ‘til he can run a marathon, and the community that lines up to cheer him on.It’s the son who finds the courage to come out as who he is, and the father whose love for that son overrides everything he’s been taught.I see it in the elderly woman who will wait in line to cast her vote as long as she has to; the new citizen who casts his for the first time; the volunteers at the polls who believe every vote should count, because each of them in different ways know how much that precious right is worth.That’s the America I know.  That’s the country we love. Clear-eyed. Big-hearted. Optimistic that unarmed truth and unconditional love will have the final word. That’s what makes me so hopeful about our future. Because of you. I believe in you. That’s why I stand here confident that the State of our Union is strong. Thank you, God bless you, and God bless the United States of America. ####

334,COP,"The big showdown in Caracas, over the seating of the new National Assembly, won by democracy campaigners but challenged by long-ruling Chavista leftists, is quite a letdown after the stunned, can't-believe-this-is-happening joy of the Dec. 6 legislative victory.After all, the opposition had tried for more than a decade to unseat these Chavistas, only to be thwarted again and again by legal maneuvers, ballot box stuffing, and kid you not, beatings on the floor of the assembly.Most insulting of all were the phony imprimaturs of free and fair elections, given by international observers, most notoriously Jimmy Carter.And then suddenly opposition won. In the Dec. 6 vote, the margin of victory was so big, the election was simply impossible to steal.Yet it didn't stop the Chavistas, who, after losing at the ballot box, turned to the courts to keep their legislative power. (As Russia's Vladimir Putin has more or less put it, when democracy fails, try ""legal dictatorship."")Venezuela's leftists challenged several seats won by the opposition, mostly from jungle districts in the far south (well known areas of government distrust and dissent, by the way) and claimed they really won them.A Chavista judge threw out most of their cases, but let them challenge four seats legally. Why? At stake was the opposition's super-majority, which would enable the new legislature to free political prisoners, investigate drug traffickers in Venezuela's cabinet, and throw out the incompetent, detested President Nicolas Maduro.Inauguration day came around and the opposition refused to let itself be cowed by left-wing legal maneuvers. Ignoring the challenges, they seated all their national assembly members and upheld the will of the people. They refused to be trussed again this time.They seem to have won, ""for now,"" as the late Hugo Chavez used to say. But it's quite likely the challenges will continue.This raises the question of why the left has such a hard time accepting defeat. One could argue that the dictatorship of Cuba's Fidel Castro and the Soviet communists he modeled his dictatorship on is at the root of it.Power forever! Let the descamisados at the balcony fist-wave and cheer!But there is also the 2000 example of Al Gore, unable to get the result he wanted in that election in Florida — howling fraud, demanding recounts in selected counties until he got the result he wanted, and making a nuisance of himself. That's a defining moment too.Illegal immigrants aligned with open borders leftist groups never accept deportation without endless legal challenges, either.""It ain't over until the alien wins,"" as the Border Patrol officials sarcastically say. Other leftist groups have made similar persistent arguments against terrorists and cop killers, inventing conspiracies when all else fails — or their clients get off scot-free.But now the age is upon us when every leftist challenges his defeat at the ballot box. Christina Fernandez de Kirchner, the newly booted president of Argentina, has taken to twitter trolling to harass and annoy her opposition successor, Mauricio Macri.Elsewhere, leftist presidents in Ecuador, Nicaragua and Bolivia have maneuvered to ensure endless re-elections — and presidencies for life.The left cannot accept defeat. Why is that? Perhaps because they are different in kind rather than degree from true democrats who believe in electoral democracy, the interplay of ideas, the laboratory of the states and the pendulum theory of political tendencies.The left has swung further left with the advent of socialist candidate Bernie Sanders. The electorate doesn't seem to notice.What's more, the left is increasingly cavalier about the constraints of law, as the unaccountable presidency of President Obama shows.It may well be that the left doesn't believe in accepting electoral results because it doesn't really believe in democracy.After all, when you're the exclusive representative of the people, and not its servant, you have a right to permanent power. You cannot see it otherwise.

363,COP,"Re-Regulation: So the candidate who gets the most money from Wall Street is going to run as an anti-Wall Street populist. Haven't the billionaire hedge-fund managers who write her six-figure checks gotten the memo?On Monday, Hillary Clinton outlined her new ""rein in Wall Street"" financial manifesto in a New York Times op-ed. She says that she will prevent another 2008-type market meltdown by doubling down on the Dodd-Frank regulatory vise.She pledges as president not only to veto any Republican financial reforms but to ""fight for tough, new rules"" that would ""go well beyond Dodd-Frank."" She wants to be the tough, new regulatory cop on the beat.Her plan would tax banks that get too big and assign federal regulators, presumably the Securities and Exchange Commission, ""the authority and tools necessary to reorganize, downsize and ultimately break up any financial institution that is too large and risky to be managed effectively.""This call to ""break up"" banks would be a nearly unprecedented grant of power to the regulatory state and its control over American commerce. In Clinton's world, we would bail out and subsidize banks if they don't make money but then tax and break them up if they make too much.These new rules would apply to ""too big to fail"" banks with more than $50 billion in assets. She fails to mention that it's precisely the high cost of Dodd-Frank compliance that has led to the ongoing consolidation in the banking industry. Big megabanks are able to absorb Dodd-Frank costs; small community banks often cannot. Doubling down on regulation will only accelerate the process of the whales swallowing the minnows.Clinton wants to close ""loopholes that still allow banks to make speculative gambles with taxpayer-backed deposits."" She wants to get rid of ""risky credit swaps and derivatives at taxpayer-backed banks.""But she has her history wrong. For the umpteenth time: Derivatives weren't the assets that crashed and shut down our financial system. It was government-insured mortgage-backed securities that went bust.The brilliant government regulators incentivized banks to hold these ""safe"" assets to meet their capital requirements. Great advice. If the banks had held more derivatives in 2008 and fewer MBSs, they would have lost less money.Finally, she proposes to assess an exit tax on corporations such as Pfizer that are planning to leave the U.S. to cut down their tax bills. There's no plan to cut the corporate tax rate, which is what inspires companies to leave in the first place, but she'd wallop them with a tax bill for being ""unpatriotic."" She will only ensure that fewer Googles and Facebooks and Pfizers are American companies in the first place.Clinton crows that her re-regulation plan has already won the ""praise"" of people like former Massachusetts Rep. Barney Frank. What a persuasive endorsement. Frank, the former chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, announced on the eve of the crisis that he wanted to ""roll the dice"" on the housing market — which he did, losing bundles of taxpayer money.Most amazing about Clinton's scheme is who it exempts from scrutiny: Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the two institutions at the epicenter of the financial forest fire. These government institutions guaranteed high-risk, low-down-payment mortgages, and they received the largest taxpayer bailouts.Worst yet, Fannie and Freddie are back with the same low-down-payment policies that accounted for a large percentage of the defaulted real estate loans. If we're going to head off the next financial crash, it's Fannie and Freddie that we should ""rein in,"" not Wall Street.Clinton's final populist proposal is to levy new fines and even criminal penalties against financial CEOs because, as she puts it, ""No one should be too big to jail.""Bold words from a woman who was chief executive at the State Department during the Benghazi fiasco and is under federal investigation for illegal use of emails that may have impaired national security.Be careful what you wish for, Madam Secretary.

New York, like most major cities across the country, is training officers to avoid physical altercations with minority suspects, lest they be accused of racism by Black Lives Matter.As part of that training, New York police are even sending new recruits to Broadway to watch a play about Emmett Till, who was killed by racists in Mississippi in 1955, to overcome their ""unconscious bias"" and increase their sensitivity toward minorities.Holder's murder was the fourth New York City police officer murdered in the past 11 months, one of the highest rates of police deaths in the nation.In May, Demetrius Blackwell was arrested for shooting New York officer Brian Moore in the head while the 25-year-old cop was on patrol. Days before Christmas, New York officers Wenjian Liu and Rafael Ramos were allegedly gunned down execution-style in their patrol car by Ismaaiyl Brinsley, who said he was retaliating for the death of Michael Brown. Brown, wanted for a robbery, was killed in self-defense by a Ferguson, Mo., cop.On Wednesday, the day after his officer was murdered, New York Police Commissioner William Bratton was supposed to meet with President Obama and civil-rights activists to discuss police ""de-biasing"" training and ""de-incarceration"" of repeat drug offenders like Howard.In fact, de-incarceration is why Howard, who had been arrested 28 times previously, was on the streets. A liberal judge diverted him from prison to a drug treatment center, which he never attended. He instead went right back to his previous lifestyle.""If ever there were a candidate not to be diverted, it was this guy,"" Bratton said. ""He's a poster boy for not being diverted.""Bratton was in Washington earlier this month meeting with Attorney General Loretta Lynch to address with other police chiefs the soaring murder rates in major cities across the country. New York, Boston, Baltimore, Minneapolis, Chicago, Milwaukee, Houston, Dallas, Cleveland, Los Angeles and Seattle have all seen dramatic spikes in violence, especially homicides.Bratton and other brass blamed ""the Ferguson effect."" Cops are reducing pro-active policing in bad neighborhoods for fear of being falsely accused by civil-rights activists of police brutality and racial bias.They're also worried about being targeted by thugs. Black Lives Matter has called on activists to kill ""pigs.""""Marchers in my city were chanting, 'What do we want? Dead cops! When do we want them? Now!' "" Bratton said. ""Well, they got them.""Mayors were also at the meeting. Rahm Emanuel of Chicago complained that de-policing in his city has led to one of the worst homicide rates on record. But Emanuel should blame his former boss. He and his attorney general declared war on cops. What did they expect?Holder was the 33rd cop fatally shot in the nation so far this year.Last month, Jarvis Hall allegedly fatally shot Forest Acres, S.C., police officer Greg Alia, who just had a baby boy with his wife. Hall allegedly ambushed Alia as he was patrolling a shopping mall.Also in September, Joseph Johnson-Shanks allegedly shot and killed Kentucky state trooper Joseph Ponder. Johnson-Shanks allegedly fired several shots through the windshield of the trooper's cruiser.If politicians want to stop soaring crime rates, they should stop vilifying cops. And they should start speaking out against the Black Lives Matter race-mongers and their patrons in the White House.

384,COP,"War On Cops: In denying a ""Ferguson effect"" that has hamstrung inner-city policing and sparked a crime outbreak, President Obama is now at odds with two of his law enforcement agencies and even his former chief of staff.In an interview with NBC News, Obama claimed there's ""no evidence"" that cops have stopped policing as aggressively as they used to, fearing they could be framed for racial bias by his Justice Department or Black Lives Matter activists.""We have not seen any evidence of that,"" the president sniffed, though allowing it's ""true that we've seen some spikes in violent crime in some cities.""Some? Try 30 of the biggest municipalities, including D.C., that have all seen homicides jump compared to last year, as of the end of September, according to data from the Major City Chiefs Association.No evidence? The head of the Drug Enforcement Agency on Wednesday joined the head of the FBI — keeper of the nation's crime data — in confirming the Ferguson effect. And last month, the mayor of Chicago pleaded with Obama's attorney general to start backing cops and stop undermining them so they can get control of raging violent crime.They're all the evidence Obama should need.""What could be driving an increase in murder in some cities across all regions of the country, all at the same time?"" FBI chief James Comey asked in a recent speech, noting ""something in policing has changed.""""I spoke to officers privately in one big city precinct who described being surrounded by young people with mobile phone cameras held high, taunting them the moment they get out of their cars,"" he explained. ""They told me, 'We feel like we're under siege and we don't feel much like getting out of our cars.'""Comey added that police commanders have urged beat cops ""to remember that their political leadership has no tolerance for a viral video.""""Part of the explanation is a chill wind blowing through American law enforcement over the last year,"" he said. ""And that wind is surely changing behavior.""""I think he's spot-on,"" concurred DEA chief Chuck Rosenberg. ""I've heard the same thing."" The Ferguson effect is causing police to second-guess confronting criminals because of ""the concern, rightly or wrongly, that you become the next viral video.""Obama's former chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, now mayor of Chicago, said the same thing last month in a private meeting with Attorney General Loretta Lynch and other mayors and police chiefs.He thought the meeting was closed to the press, but a reporter caught him on tape saying the Ferguson effect has put Chicago cops in a ""fetal"" position. ""They have pulled back,"" he vented. ""They don't want their career ended early.""Emanuel might have otherwise gone along with Obama's war on cops. But the skyrocketing Chicago murder rate threatens to sink his reelection hopes.Despite the demonstrable link between anti-cop race-mongering and surging crime, this president is doubling down. Last week, he issued a 30-page advisory to the nation's 18,000 police departments warning them to ""de-escalate"" encounters with urban suspects and find ""alternatives to arrest.""This Ferguson syndrome is also being fueled by Hillary Clinton on the campaign trail, where she's shamelessly pandering to the Black Lives Matter crowd and promising to end ""racial profiling"" in law enforcement.As Comey's, Rosenberg's and Emanuel's remarks attest, the Democratic Party's anti-policing agenda is losing support within its own ranks. This is shocking stuff, showing how radical and dangerous the president's and his heir apparent's views on criminal justice are.

385,COP,"Get Jonathan Corr talking about his job, and it doesn't take long before he starts mentioning body counts. Corr isn't a cop or in the military. Nor is he referring to victims of terrorism or advocating for gun control. But his interest is tied to a subject that also inspires headlines — the after-effects of the housing crisis.
"
386,COP,"For him, it's about how quality controls and new financial regulations have caused lenders' costs for completing a home loan to more than double since 2009, to around $7,000 per loan.
"
387,COP,"""They've thrown bodies at the problem,"" Corr said.
"
388,COP,"Corr is chief executive of Ellie Mae (ELLI), a software company that helps wean lenders away from, as he puts it, ""throwing just bodies and additional labor costs at the problem."" In his words, he helps lenders ""embrace technology and automation.""
"
389,COP,"Based near Silicon Valley in Pleasanton, Calif., Ellie Mae sells lenders business-automation software to help streamline and automate the mortgage loan process, facilitate regulatory compliance and reduce errors in documents.
"
390,COP,"Regulations Help
"
391,COP,"Thanks in part to increasing regulations that have come out since the financial crisis, starting with the Dodd-Frank Act and the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, demand for Ellie Mae's software has grown. Over the last five years, revenue has climbed 42% on an annual compounded rate, while per-share profit has jumped 54%.
"
392,COP,"When Ellie Mae reported third-quarter results last week, the company said revenue surged 61% over the same period in 2014 to $68.9 million. The company ended the quarter with 135,000 active users on its core Encompass mortgage-management platform, a 30% rise from the same period in 2014. Meanwhile, earnings climbed 67% to 45 cents a share, blasting through analyst estimates.
"
393,COP,"That sent shares up more than 3% the next trading day, on Oct. 29, to close at 75.60. But the stock fell more than 3% on Friday and 9% on Monday, as investors took profits, perhaps signaling second-thought concerns about the firm's weak earnings guidance for the fourth quarter. The stock, however, has stabilized around 67.
"
394,COP,"In its earnings report, Ellie Mae said it expects Q4 earnings to fall to 18 cents to 20 cents a share from last year's 38 cents a share. It blamed an accounting impact from a pending acquisition, increased investments and normal seasonality.
"
395,COP,"The acquisition, of St. Louis-based Mortgage Returns, was announced earlier in October for an undisclosed sum. Mortgage Returns' customer relationship management and marketing automation solutions for the mortgage industry will be integrated into Ellie Mae's Encompass platform.
"
396,COP,"Analysts don't seem too concerned about the weak Q4 guidance. After the earnings report, JMP Securities' Patrick Walravens maintained a ""market outperform"" on Ellie Mae and raised the price target to $83 from $80.
"
397,COP,"Tailwinds
"
398,COP,"""They are selling into two strong secular tailwinds,"" said Brian Schwartz, an analyst with Oppenheimer & Co. ""The first is that lenders are in the midst of re-envisioning and modernizing their front-office applications with software-as-a-service (SaaS) products.""
"
399,COP,"The other tailwind, he says, comes from more regulatory pressures. They often prompt lenders to invest in new technology.
"
400,COP,"But some regulatory changes can stall adoption rates as lenders come to grips with them. That may have been the case with new mortgage disclosure rules that took effect in early October under the integrated Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA) and Truth in Lending Act (TILA). Known by the blended name TRID, the regulations mandate a litany of changes to the way mortgages are handled and information on them is disclosed to consumers.
"
401,COP,"While Ellie Mae set another record for user bookings in the third quarter, it was mostly from existing customers adding on seats and licensees converting to its mainstay SaaS product, analyst Samad Samana of FBR & Co. said in a note to clients.
"
402,COP,"Bookings Down
"
403,COP,"Ellie Mae booked only 2,500 seats from new users, he noted, down 54% from a year earlier and 43% lower than the prior quarter. Management had warned the distraction caused by the new disclosures could cause a temporary slowdown, as was the case in a similar instance in early 2014.
"
404,COP,"It's not that there's anything wrong with Ellie Mae's products, analysts say. They are ""the most comprehensive"" in the market, according to Schwartz. In customer satisfaction surveys, the company scores ""near the top of the chart in our coverage universe"" of SaaS software vendors, he says.
"
405,COP,"Corr says customers can save up to $1,000 on processing a loan by using its software. Ellie Mae customers range in size from small community banks to large regional banks and mortgage companies.
"
406,COP,"""We don't have the top-five money center banks; they tend to build on their own software. We have the next set of folks down,"" Corr said. Among Ellie Mae's customers are PennyMac Financial (PFSI), Zions Bancorp (ZION) and EverBank Financial (EVER).
"
407,COP,"About 25% to 30% of mortgage loans in the U.S. run across the company's Encompass platform, Corr says. The vast majority is for SaaS, and the platform is used for both residential loans and refinancing.
"
408,COP,"Right now the mix is skewed to home purchase loans vs. refis, which suits Ellie Mae just fine. As Corr says, its customers and the consumers they serve tend to work with local bankers and mortgage lenders more on home-purchase loans than refinancings.
"
409,COP,"""What's good for us is volume, whether refi or purchase,"" Corr said. ""But purchase is even more attractive because our customers tend to do more of that. And as the market is shifting to purchase, we benefit from that.""
"
410,COP,"New Mortgages

411,COP,"This year has been a strong year for mortgage originations. Total originations through the first nine months were up nearly 43% from a year earlier, topping all of last year's production, according to Inside Mortgage Finance.
"
412,COP,"But even if originations slow, as they are expected to do next year, Ellie Mae is likely to keep picking up market share from customers who want to automate their lending processes, company executives say.
"
413,COP,"Ellie Mae expects to grow revenue at least 25% a year for the foreseeable future. Last year, revenue grew 26%, and this year it's seen rising 55% to $250 million, according to analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. Next year, that growth should slow to 22%.
"
414,COP,"Analysts expect earnings to climb 27% this year to $1.46 a share, and to go up another 23% next year.
"
415,COP,"""There are no main rivals,"" said Oppenheimer's Schwartz. The ""niche element"" it goes after, mortgage originations, has not attracted larger tech suppliers, who are ""more interested in monetizing a loan after it closes,"" he says. ""Ellie Mae is going after automating the process.""

417,COP,"War On Cops: The Washington Post has just conducted a massive survey of police shootings and found that — surprise, surprise! — virtually all of them are justified. Thanks. Now where do cops go to get back their reputations?Certainly not the White House. It's claiming there's ""no evidence"" to support the FBI director's recent statements about a ""Ferguson effect"" hampering police work.In fact, data show police morale and arrests are down in St. Louis, Baltimore, New York, Seattle and other cities where police are under siege, while crime is spiraling out of control.A recent Justice Department investigation of the St. Louis County Police Department found no conclusive evidence of racial bias. It did find the number of police stops, searches and arrests of blacks in the county plunged last year after the Ferguson riots.There were 1,918 fewer stops of black drivers in 2014 vs. 2013, and 624 fewer arrests. Policing in the black community fell to the lowest level in years.The Ferguson effect is also supported by anecdotal evidence. In Birmingham, Ala., a white police officer allowed himself to be pistol-whipped unconscious by a black suspect, rather than fight back and risk being accused of racism.Seeing its war on cops and soft-on-crime approach backfiring with surging crime rates, the White House is trying to cover its tracks by dismissing the alarming trend. The president himself has taken to the podium to pooh-pooh the link between cop-bashing and the national crime wave.Obama even called FBI chief James Comey to the White House for an unscheduled meeting Thursday. No doubt the purpose was to get Comey to couch the truth of what's become an embarrassing political situation for the president and a crisis for the public.But the Post has undercut Obama's main excuse for federalizing the nation's 18,000 police departments through ""criminal justice reform.""The paper analyzed 800 fatal police shootings and found that in 74% of the cases, police pulled the trigger only after the suspect fired, brandished a gun or attacked someone. In 16% of the shootings, cops fired when the suspect acted in a dangerous and threatening manner, such as refusing to put down a knife.In 5% of the cases, officers used force when the suspect refused to show his hands and made a sudden move that made them think he was reaching for a weapon. The Post said the justification for force in the remaining 5% of cases was undetermined.So much for the myth racist cops are shooting people for no reason. But the damage is done. Authority is breaking down in violent hot spots across the country as cops back off. Cries of ""overpolicing"" black urban areas has led to tragic underpolicing.Baltimore residents complain of drug dealers walking down the street, openly firing guns in the air like the Wild West. The Los Angeles police chief says a resurgence in gang shootings has turned L.A. into Dodge City. In Charlotte, N.C., meanwhile, ""people are just pulling out guns and shooting one another,"" the deputy police chief said.FBI chief Comey is the keeper of the nation's crime records. He's hardly ""cherry-picking"" data, as Obama contends.Police and prosecutors worked hard over the past 20 years to reduce our nation's violent crime rate to historic lows. Tough drug laws and aggressive policing made black urban neighborhoods in particular safer — and it was black politicians who demanded those laws.Now in the name of racial justice, Obama is undoing all that, and the biggest victims are the victims of black-on-black crime.
"
418,COP,"War On Cops: President Obama praised Black Lives Matter as a ""legitimate"" movement that has nothing to do with surging violent crime in our cities, a trend that he claims pundits are hyping. But that's not what his FBI chief says.Obama had the temerity to tell police chiefs at a White House meeting that Black Lives Matter, a group that chants ""Pigs In A Blanket, Fry 'Em Like Bacon,"" never really was ""in opposition to the police."" And he said it can't be blamed for recent attacks on officers and de-policing in high-crime areas.The president also scoffed at growing alarm over an unusual spike in murders across the nation over the past 10 months. Though he says it's ""getting hyped"" by the press, he insists it's not part of a crime wave.FBI Director James Comey, meanwhile, gave testimony on Capitol Hill that totally contradicted his boss.""Something very disturbing is happening in law enforcement and in violent crime,"" Comey said before the House Judiciary Committee. ""We are seeing a dramatic spike in violent crime, especially homicide, in cities all across the country.""In communities of color especially, young men are dying at a rate that dwarfs what we've seen in recent history,"" he added. ""It's happening all over the country, and it's happening all in the last 10 months.""Indeed, major cities including Milwaukee, St. Louis, Baltimore, Washington, New Orleans, Chicago, Dallas, Kansas City and Charlotte have seen double-digit jumps in murder rates over the past year. Virtually all the violence is concentrated in black urban areas.""People are just pulling out guns and shooting one another,"" Charlotte's deputy police chief said at a news conference last week, adding that the spike in crime comes despite police reaching out to people in communities of color more than ever.The problem, law enforcement says, is police officers are making fewer arrests. And they're making fewer collars, particularly in the inner city, because they fear they'll be framed for civil-rights abuses by Obama's civil-rights prosecutors and goons in the Black Lives Matter movement.In a Friday speech at the University of Chicago Law School, Comey said this so-called Ferguson effect may in fact have something to do with the uptick in violent crime.""I don't know whether that explains it entirely,"" he said, ""but I do have a strong sense that some part of the explanation is a chill wind that has blown through American law enforcement over the last year.""But it's no mystery.Obama gave the bad guys license. He in so many words announced: ""I am going to investigate cops, and not you."" Then he egged on the cop-hating Black Lives Matter movement, joining activists in falsely accusing men and women in blue of systemic racism.And now, even as the number of murder victims grows, the president is doubling down on his incendiary rhetoric and escalating the war on cops.At last count, Obama had launched investigations against 20 police departments across the country for alleged civil rights violations. Fearing they'll be next, the New York Police Department and other large forces are proactively instituting White House-recommended reforms to soften law enforcement in minority communities.It's a form of amnesty. Criminals in Ferguson got their warrants expunged, while looters and arsonists in Baltimore were given ""space"" to rob and burn.Virtually every time a cop in Seattle or New York comes in physical contact with a perp now, police have to file a report. The data, in turn, will be reviewed for racial bias. These new rules will only make beat cops more gun-shy about stopping and questioning suspects. And they will only further embolden criminals.

458,COP,"Law And Order: As violent crime waves swamp police across the U.S., the Obama regime plans to dump 6,000 prisoners convicted of drug dealing back on the streets, starting the end of this month. What could go wrong?Don't worry, the Justice Department says, the mass clemency won't hurt public safety. No need to protect yourself. Guns are bad.You might ask yourself why any hardcore drug offenders — many of whom are career criminals with related weapons charges — would be set free nationwide before serving out federal sentences. Good question.It's because this president thinks drug laws are ""unfair"" to blacks and Hispanics, who tend to be locked up by them at higher rates than whites. So he's waving his magic wand of ""social justice"" and granting them early release.But relax. This is just the first batch of lucky criminals to walk. Many more will follow, coming to a town near you.Thanks to retroactively shortened drug sentences, another 40,000 crack and meth dealers are expected to be set free over the next five years, with a whopping 8,550 inmates eligible for release next year. It's the largest one-time release of federal felons ever.All told, almost half the roughly 100,000 drug offenders in federal prison could qualify for early release.Over the next several years, long after Obama is gone, wave after wave of drug offenders, many of them members of violent gangs, will flood American streets, including in the U.S. capital, where drug-related shootings are on the rise.Meanwhile, Justice has instructed prosecutors to go easy on new drug offenders. What message are drug traffickers and drug cartels hearing from this newfound leniency? The streets of America are open for business again.Make no mistake, allowing so many hardened criminals to be released at the same time will cause crime to surge. But this president doesn't seem to care. Fellow Chicagoans are gunned down by gangsters by the dozen each week, and he says nary a peep about such tragic black-on-black violence. Yet he's all over TV, grandstanding and demagoguing, if a white cop kills a violent thug in self-defense.Obama calls his mass prison break ""justice"" for racist crack laws. Yeah, tell that to all the South Side Chicago mothers grieving dead sons and daughters, some as young as 2 years old, gunned down in the crossfire of drug gang wars.

461,COP,"Bias: Hewing to their corrupt anti-cop narrative, the Big Three news networks refuse to cover Black Lives Matter activists chanting death threats within hours of a cold-blooded police execution linked to their movement.While ABC, NBC and CBS covered the deadly ambushing of a white Houston sheriff's deputy by a black man, who sneaked up behind the uniformed officer at a gas station and fired 15 bullets at close range, they left out the related news that Black Lives Matter protesters shortly thereafter demonized cops as ""pigs"" and called for them to ""fry.""Even so, some of the networks blasted the deputy's boss for tying the racist assassination to the violent anti-cop rhetoric spewed by Black Lives Matter agitators.""Over the weekend, Harris County Sheriff Ron Hickman made controversial statements linking the crime to the Black Lives Matter movement,"" the CBS Evening News scolded. ""Some have called the statement insensitive,"" though no critics were ID'd.Here's what's really insensitive: Turns out that Black Lives Matter borrowed their chant from the anti-cop ""pigs in a blanket"" rhetoric of the killer of two NYPD officers in December. Before ambushing and shooting the cops as they sat in their patrol car, Ismaaiyl Brinsley said that he was taking revenge for what jurors and even the Obama Justice Department deemed the justified police shooting of Michael Brown.""I'm putting wings on pigs today. They take 1 of ours ... let's take 2 of theirs,"" Brinsley wrote on Instagram, alongside a photo of a silver handgun. ""This may be my final post ... I'm putting pigs in a blanket.""Also missing from the mainstream media's coverage: the Democratic National Committee's issuing of a new resolution in support of the Black Lives Matter movement.That's right: the DNC just passed a resolution praising the belligerent group: ""Whereas we hear the 'Black Lives Matter' cry . .. be it resolved that the DNC joins with Americans across the country in affirming 'Black Lives Matter' ... as they condemn extrajudicial killings of unarmed African-American men ... at the hands of the police.""The Democrat Party's statement of support goes on to exalt Michael Brown while echoing Black Lives Matter's calls for ""demilitarization of police, ending racial profiling (and) criminal justice reform.""Given that four cops have been murdered in the past seven days, this is a scandalous political development. The media elite ignored it to protect fellow Democrats.It's clear that the media are trying to paint a one-sided picture of the interaction between the black community and police in this country. By twisting the facts and burying hard truths, they're feeding into what has become a very real and dangerous war on cops.

483,COP,"Law And Disorder: Violent criminals are getting the upper hand as the ""Ferguson effect"" takes hold in cities across the country. Less-aggressive policing has emboldened the bad guys, leading to a nationwide spike in murder.New data show murder rates have shot up across major cities as police morale plummets. Surveys show police feel ""under siege"" by race-baiting politicians and activists, as well as increasingly hostile suspects, and are second-guessing themselves as they respond to crimes. As IBD's Andrew Malcolm notes elsewhere, other surveys show Americans see the police under seige as well.Officers fear violating softer new use-of-force and arrest policies pushed on cities by the Obama Justice Department will open them up to civil-rights prosecution. Many have backed off patrols and stops in dangerous urban areas as a result.Fearing ambush, moreover, police in some cities are doubling up patrols, reducing the breadth of officer presence on the street. Inner-city residents complain criminals aren't being taken off the streets like before.The result: Year-over-year homicide rates are up 76% in Milwaukee; 60% in St. Louis; 56% in Baltimore; 44% in Washington, D.C.; 22% in New Orleans; 20% in Chicago; 20% in Kansas City; and 17% in Dallas. And single-digit rises have been seen in New York and other cities.Residents in Baltimore and Ferguson, Mo., now complain cops aren't showing up fast enough to crime calls. Milwaukee Police Chief Edward Flynn acknowledged his officers are making fewer traffic stops and conducting fewer field interviews, thanks to ""free-floating anxiety"" among law enforcement officers across the nation.The crime wave may only get worse as departments fail to recruit enough rank-and-file officers to put on the street. The National Sheriff's Association says recruitment nationally is ""way down,"" thanks to the anti-cop climate. The number of police applicants in Seattle is down more than 90% since Justice accused the department of racial bias and forced it to adopt reforms.Police recruits are down in Chicago and Philadelphia, as well. Miami is understaffed by about 500 officers.""I saw all this anti-cop propaganda and I was like, 'Who needs this?'"" an applicant to the NYPD academy said after withdrawing his candidacy.Cop-bashing doesn't make anybody safer, least of all inner-city residents caught in the crossfire.
"
484,COP,"War On Cops: Amid a rash of deadly ambushes of police officers, President Obama suddenly is concerned for their safety. Not so fast. Obama is chief among the anti-cop antagonists who've put police lives in danger.After spending a year falsely vilifying police as racist murderers, Obama has softened his tone. What changed? National outcry over the cold-blooded assassination of a Houston cop.Police on Saturday arrested Shannon Miles, who they said shot 15 bullets into Deputy Darren Goforth as he fueled his patrol car. Miles is black, and Goforth was white. It was the 18th deadly ambushing of a cop this year, tripling 2014's count.Obama's sudden concern also comes amid a massive manhunt for the killers of a suburban Chicago cop. Assailants shot Lt. Charles J. Gliniewicz, stripped him of his gun and other gear, and left him to die in a swamp. The murder marks the fourth in 10 days across the U.S.It's an alarming trend. And since it's now a national political issue, Obama finally addressed it, though not in the public way he condemned cops in Ferguson and Baltimore. He called Harris County Sheriff's Deputy Darren Goforth's widow and issued a statement saying that he did so, adding that he will ""continue to stand up for the safety of police officers wherever they serve.""The nerve. While Obama hasn't called outright for hostilities against police, he helped craft Black Lives Matter's false narrative that racist white cops kill innocent blacks all the time. And like BLM, he has fueled anti-cop hatred with anti-cop rhetoric.There have been many instances where this president has sided with violent black suspects over police evidence that even minority jurors could see vindicated the cops. His words and actions have been contemptibly biased against cops. Consider the following: After a Ferguson police officer killed violent robber Michael Brown in self-defense, Obama held a presser to scold the white cop, saying that there was ""no excuse"" for ""excessive force"" by police. ""His family will never hold Michael in their arms again,"" he lamented, while sending two senior White House officials to Brown's funeral. Obama then sicced his attorney general on the Ferguson police department. Eric Holder opened a civil-rights investigation, even though he knew at the time that eyewitnesses, ballistics and forensics all backed the cop's story that Brown punched him, grabbed his gun and tried to shoot him with it. After a Baltimore drug dealer died while resisting arrest, Obama once again canonized the thug while demonizing the cops. ""We have seen too many instances of what appears to be police officers interacting with individuals, primarily African-American, often poor, in ways that raise troubling questions,"" Obama said. ""This has been a slow-rolling crisis. This has been going on for a long time. This is not new, and we shouldn't pretend that it's new."" Obama gave all black criminals an excuse to lash out. He claimed that police across the country carry ""hidden biases"" against blacks and that he has been a victim himself. He claimed that security guards have tailed him in department stores and that police cars have pulled him over for no apparent reason. ""It's one thing for me to be mistaken for a waiter at a gala,"" Obama said. ""It's another thing for my son to be mistaken for a robber and to be handcuffed; or worse, if he happens to be walking down the street and is dressed the way teenagers dress.""The president now says that the targeting of police officers is ""totally unacceptable."" Yet he's the one who framed the target and egged on the bad guys who pull the actual triggers.Bashing police officers as racists who harass and brutalize people of color has inflamed the community and given them the opportunity to say, well, the president says so, therefore it must be OK to fight back and even assault ""pigs.""Truth is, the ""rolling crisis"" isn't police brutality. It's cop killing. The blood of slain police officers is on this president's hands, and no belated calls to their widows now will wash it off.

486,COP,"War On Cops: Within hours of a black man assassinating a Houston police officer, ""Black Lives Matter"" protesters called for more violence on cops. The movement is putting lives in jeopardy. Will the president condemn it?Over the weekend, Shannon Jaruay Miles, a college dropout with three previous convictions for resisting arrest, allegedly ran up behind Harris County Sheriff's Deputy Darren Goforth and shot him in the head as he filled his patrol car with gas.The suspect then shot the deputy repeatedly in the back as he lay dying on the ground. Investigators found 15 shell casings at the scene, meaning the shooter unloaded his gun on Goforth, who leaves behind a wife and two children.Police say Goforth had no previous contact with Miles and that the attack was unprovoked. They say Miles was targeting the deputy because he wore a uniform. They also suggest that his skin color played a role. Goforth was white and Miles is black.Harris County Sheriff Ron Hickman says Miles may have been motivated by anger over recent police killings of black men elsewhere in the U.S. Just days earlier, a caller to a black Internet radio show based in Texas had called for the ""lynching"" of white people, and the killing of police officers, to ""turn the tide.""The host reportedly is connected to the Black Lives Matter movement protesting the death of Michael Brown and other suspects killed by police. The anti-police rhetoric has gotten out of hand.""At any point where the rhetoric ramps up to the point where calculated cold-blooded assassination of police officers happens, this rhetoric has gotten out of control,"" Hickman said. ""We've heard black lives matter . . . well, cops' lives matter, too.""Data show police are increasingly being targeted for assault. Deadly shootings and assaults on cops almost doubled last year to 51, according to the FBI. And so far this year the number of cops killed in ambush attacks have spiked to 15, tripling the total a year ago.The Houston attack comes on the heels of the brutal beating of a white Birmingham, Ala., police officer by a black man. ""Pistol whipped his ass to sleep,"" a triumphant witness tweeted under the hashtag #FckDaPolice. The injured officer said he didn't fight back because he didn't want to be accused of racism.Similar gloating followed 2014's fatal ambushing of two NYPD cops by a black man claiming to avenge the police shooting of Brown and Staten Island's Eric Garner.George Soros-sponsored Black Lives Matter marchers may be encouraging attacks on police. BLM protesters disrupting the Minnesota state fair over the weekend chanted in unison, ""Pigs in a blanket, fry 'em like bacon."" BLM organizers say they're calling for peaceful reforms of police, not violence.In Ferguson, hundreds of BLM protesters marching on the anniversary of Brown's death converged on police headquarters and placed a cooked pig with a police cap on its head in front of the building. Scrawled on the carcass was the name ""Darren Wilson,"" the officer whom jurors agreed shot Brown in self defense.""It's open season right now, there's no doubt about it,"" said Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clarke agreed, and President Obama gave them license. ""The president of the United States started this war on police,"" Clarke asserted.Indeed, Obama's many statements canonizing thugs like Brown, while demonizing cops have empowered criminals targeting police. Obama helped create the Black Lives Matter movement. Now it's up to him to rein the group in before it incites more cop-killings.

552,COP,"War On Terror: Another Islamist extremist has slaughtered unarmed American troops on home soil. Will this, too, be declared ""workplace violence"" — just like the last act of terrorism committed against our disarmed military?Here's what we knew at press time: An apparent lone gunman shot a barrage of gunfire at two military facilities in Tennessee, killing at least four Marines and wounding a soldier and a police officer. The shooter was killed, and the media quickly identified him as Muhammad Youssef Abdulazeez, a naturalized U.S. citizen from Kuwait.Far be it from us to rush to judgment, but just before the shooting an ISIS-linked Twitter account tweeted out: ""O Americans Dogs soon YOU Will see wonders #Chattanooga #USA #ISIS.""According to Jihad Watch, this tweet is similar to one sent out just before the attack on the ""Draw Muhammad"" cartoon event in Garland, Texas, last May, where two ISIS-linked gunmen opened fire.So this was almost certainly a terrorist attack by an Islamic extremist.But there's one key difference between this attack and the one in Garland: In Texas, the attack failed when an off-duty traffic cop took down the rifle-toting, body-armored Islamists Nadir Soofi and Elton Simpson with a single Glock pistol.That didn't happen in Tennessee. According to a screen grab posted on the Internet, Thursday's attacks were made on a gun-free military facility. Perhaps if the victims had been themselves carrying weapons, they would have been able to defend themselves.By the way, this is tragically similar to the 2009 Fort Hood attacks by Major Nidal Malik Hasan that left 13 dead and 30 wounded. The Obama administration then termed the slaughter of unarmed U.S. soldiers an instance of ""workplace violence"" — not terrorism.As at Ft. Hood, the Marines in Tennessee didn't appear to have any weapons. They were disarmed not by their attacker, but by a foolish federal policy that put them in danger. If even one of them had been armed, perhaps he could have stopped the attack.If our troops are going to be serially targeted by terrorists, as it now appears, shouldn't they at least be able to carry side arms to protect themselves?While we're at it, it would be an outrage to insult the American public and dishonor our four dead Marines by declaring this another instance of ""workplace violence,"" or any other such euphemistic nonsense.The name for this is terrorism.

553,COP,"WASHINGTON, D.C. — Mexico is hopeful it will join Canada in importing U.S. crude, as exemptions to Washington's oil export ban grow.Sending light shale crude from the U.S. to Mexico in exchange for Mexico's heavier crude is ""under active consideration"" by Washington, said Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz at the Energy Information Administration's conference Monday. ""With Mexico's energy reform, a lot of things are different.""There is demand for Mexico's heavier crude as refineries in Louisiana and other Gulf states are fitted to process heavy crude, not the light stuff coming from the Eagle Ford and Permian Basin.But the export ban isn't in Moniz's ""bailiwick,"" and the Commerce Department needs to approve the deal.Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex), Mexico's state-run oil company, applied for the swaps last year, though no updates have been given to the status of its request.But Mexico doesn't want to push the U.S. into speeding up the decision, according to Leonardo Beltran Rodriguez, Mexico's deputy secretary for planning and energy transition.The crude export ban has been in place since the 1970s and was designed to protect domestic energy supplies and reduce reliance on oil from the Middle East and other overseas players. But some shipments to Canada are allowed under the law, and exports of refined products aren't affected.While lifting the export ban outright might not come for several years, more exemptions are gaining momentum. Last June, the Commerce Department gave Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) and Enterprise Products Partners (EPD) approval to export minimally processed condensate, a type of ultralight oil.Mexico is eager to improve energy relations with its northern neighbor. Rodriguez also emphasized how important ""integration"" is as it opens up its energy industry. Mexico is already working on building 10,000 kilometers of natural gas pipelines with the U.S.In December of 2013, Mexico declared the start of its energy reform, allowing Pemex to keep its monopoly on oil but partner with foreign firms on development projects.Rodriguez expects total investments in the oil and gas sector of $50 billion to $60 billion over the next four years.U.S. companies are poised to take advantage of Mexico's energy revolution. Exxon Mobil (XOM) and ConocoPhillips (COP) want to help extract the estimated 27 billion barrels of deep-sea crude oil in Mexico's waters.Follow Gillian Rich on Twitter: @IBD_GRich.

554,COP,"WASHINGTON, D.C. — Continental Resources' (CLR) CEO argued Tuesday for removing the ban on exporting crude oil from the United States, saying that ""Cowboyistan"" producers already face limits on domestic buyers as foreign companies acquire U.S. refiners.Foreign countries own 28% of U.S. refining capacity, or about 4.9 million barrels per day, according to Harold Hamm. Venezuela owns the most, with Canada second and Saudi Arabia third.Two-thirds of U.S. refining capacity handles heavy crude, like that from Venezuela and Mexico, leaving only 6 million barrels per day of refining capacity for the light, sweet crude coming from Cowboyistan's Eagle Ford, Permian and Bakken plays in Texas and North Dakota.""A lot of our refiners are being converted for other people's use,"" Hamm said at the Energy Information Administration conference.So while American crude is stuck inside the U.S. to compete against imported oil for refining, global refining capacity can handle 64 million barrels of the lighter crude, with Europe and Southeast Asia among those markets, Hamm noted.Continental Resources shares ticked up 0.1% to 46.82 on the stock market today. U.S. crude futures were up 0.7% to $59.94 per barrel. Brent was flat at $63.95.Calls for lifting the export ban — which began in the 1970s to protect Americans from price spikes — intensified after oil prices sank last fall and winter, and forced companies to shut down drilling activity. Domestic producers say that opening up more markets for exports would keep the U.S. shale oil flowing.But Hamm acknowledged that even when production starts to recover, it takes three to four times longer to restart production than to take it offline. So if removing production takes six months, putting it all back online will take two years.Hamm and others believe that the export ban is outdated now that the U.S. has entered into an energy ""renaissance"" with horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing.""We know lifting the ban would de-intensify the Middle East,"" he said. ""And we need to get supplies to our allies in Europe who are so dependent on Russia.""Hamm said that unlike exporting liquefied natural gas, exporting oil could happen quickly as the U.S. already has the infrastructure in place to send crude abroad.Exxon Mobil (XOM), Chevron (CVX), Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) and ConocoPhillips (COP) all support lifting the ban, with only some smaller independent producers against, Hamm said.The export ban hasn't protected American jobs from predatory practices by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, which has shown no signs of easing up on its strategy of keeping prices low to drive out higher-cost producers like U.S. shale firms.Hamm estimates that the drop in oil prices has directly and indirectly affected half a million jobs related to the oil industry.He believes that the ban will be lifted and says that two bills are currently under consideration in Congress. But while lifting the export ban outright might not come for several years, more exemptions are gaining momentum. Last June, the Commerce Department gave Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) and Enterprise Products Partners (EPD) approval to export minimally processed condensate, a type of ultralight oil.Follow Gillian Rich on Twitter: @IBD_GRich.

558,COP,"War On Cops: As two Mississippi police officers are laid to rest, the FBI says the number of cops feloniously killed in the line of duty soared 89% last year. How much can a cop-vilifying president be blamed for the trend?Deadly shootings and assaults on cops jumped to 51 in 2014 from 27 in 2013, according to preliminary FBI data.The total includes the brutal ambush of two New York City policemen as they sat in their squad car in New York on Dec. 20. Their black killer, Ismaaiyl Abdullah Brinsley, indicated that he sneaked up to their parked patrol car and shot them both in the head as payback for the deaths of Eric Garner in New York and Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo.This year is shaping up to be as bad, if not worse, for cop killings. Five NYPD cops already are believed to have been shot by black criminals in just the past five months. Last week, 25-year-old officer Brian Moore was fatally shot in the head while in his car, allegedly by career criminal Demetrius Blackwell.And this week, four blacks were charged with the shooting deaths of Hattiesburg, Miss., police officers Benjamin Deen and Liquori Tate. The cops were ambushed while making a traffic stop. Two of the suspects allegedly then stole their police cruiser as a getaway car.Law enforcement officials say President Obama and his ""war on police"" are to blame for the tragedies. Even some African-American brass are livid over his demagoguing, as acts of racism, recent unintended deaths of black criminals who resisted arrest or attacked police.""Obama started this war on police intentionally,"" said Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clarke. ""Right in line with his community agitating.""Media are also to blame. From Ferguson to Baltimore, they've parroted the false narrative put out by a race-mongering White House and Justice Department. When a white officer kills a black man, the media are quick to point out the race, never the other way around.Obama's press popinjays have made great hay of the racial element in the Ferguson, Staten Island, N.Y., and Baltimore cases involving black suspects who died while resisting arrest.But they completely overlook the race factor in recent shootings of police. They have written off the shooting deaths of cops by black assailants as ""isolated incidents,"" arguing that the real threat is from white cops ""targeting"" black men.Here's a fact they won't tell you: 42% of officers murdered in the line of duty over the past decade were shot by black suspects — and therein lies the real story, and real crisis. Evidence shows police face a lethal and growing threat from violent black criminals, not vice versa.But Obama is agitating to give them, in the words of Baltimore's mayor, ""the space"" to break the law, which only means they'll have more opportunities to kill cops.

575,COP,"So it was only last week - when we were celebrating the breakout by the Nasdaq market - a breakout that took 15 years to accomplish....On April 24th - My Morning Thoughts started out like this and asked that age old question:
"
576,COP,"Oh.....now it is getting interesting.....but is it getting a bit 'bubbly'?
"
577,COP,"Nasdaq made history yesterday....breaking out of its 15 year purgatory....but the breakout did not come with any fanfare, or bells and whistles.......Yesterday at 11:55 am....traders took the Nasdaq up and thru its former high of 5048 - as it ticked at 5049......... and shift into overdrive....the algo's kicked in forcing it to a new all time intraday high of 5069. At the closing bell - Nasdaq ended the day at 5056....signaling a 'new dawn'....and this during what many would consider the worst earnings season in recent memory (negative 4% growth) ....
"
578,COP,"And that was the 'kiss of death' - Just a few days ago we were celebrating - Nasdaq was the new darling child, the S&P 500 was at an all-time new high and the Dow and Russell were teasing with their all-time highs.........but today - the Dow 30 is now flat for the year and both the S&P and Nasdaq have closed below their 50 day moving average's and the small cap Russell 2000 - well that broke its 50 & is now sitting right on its 100 dma at 1217.
"
579,COP,"In the past week - stocks have reversed course, giving back all of the April gains.....There was not one sector left standing as investors did a little 'window undressing' at the end of the month....or as the incomparable Arthur Cashin of UBS and worldwide fame said:
"
580,COP,"""Today's action looks like end of month window BREAKING""
"
581,COP,"And so it was.....you could hear the smashing glass as investors started throwing everything out the window - the only thing left was the kitchen sink....but hold on - that may be next....
"
582,COP,"We can credit the 'usual suspects'.........ongoing uncertainty about the outlook for interest rates, the pending Greek Tragedy, key weak earnings, weakening macro data and the tensions building in the Persian Gulf as the Iranians try to bully the international community causing us to send warships to 'accompany US ships thru the Strait of Hormuz.....as one 'unidentified' US Official put it:
"
583,COP,"""Out of abundance of caution, because of the unpredictability of our Iranian friends, we're now positioned so that, should the Iranians decide that they're going to be stupid, we're ready to respond...."" (Iranian officials have yet to comment...)
"
584,COP,"So after you turn on the lights and look back- you will see that we haven't gone anywhere in the broad market so far this year. Yesterday, we got confirmation that the economy is not growing...... 4 months ago the GDP was 'supposedly' growing at 5.0% and now the GDP is growing at 0.02%. - Yes - that is NOT a typo.....a 4.98% reversal in activity......and this as all of the major indexes were making all time highs. (There's that whole disconnect thing again......)
"
585,COP,"But you say - ""Why the negative - we knew this...The Atlanta Fed's forecasting model actually called for growth of 0.01% - so in fact - we beat it! Where are the party hats? What does the Atlanta Fed say about this quarter? Their initial forecast calls for growth of 0.9% - a far cry from the consensus estimates of 3% - so the reality of the robust recovery......well - ain't so robust. These are recession numbers....Hey...I'm just sayin.....
"
586,COP,"Over the last 2 weeks - we have seen the dollar get clobbered (not such a bad thing for the multinationals)...it is down 5% - this though has been good for oil...(dollar down/oil up) and prices ended the month of April up another $1.05 closing at $59.63/barrel or up 17% in that same time. And with tensions building in the gulf - you can rest assured that there is now a floor under the price of oil....(could this whole Iranian thing be a set up to goose oil?)
"
587,COP,"Yesterday we heard from some of the big oil companies.... Exxon Mobil (XOM), Chevron (CHV), ConocoPhillips (COP), - while the plunge in oil prices has caused some heartburn for the oil producers it has created a boom for the refiners.....and in fact American refiners are laughing all the way to the bank....because US crude - cheaper than Brent - has given them the competitive advantage over their European and Mid East rivals.......and the plot thickens.....
"
588,COP,"After the bell - LinkedIn (LKND) slashed guidance - blaming the strong dollar and weaker demand for its problems.....the stock was down 5 points during the trading day and then got slammed in the afterhours session......dropping more than 20%....this morning in early pre-market trading it is hovering around $201....There we go again with these 'high growth stocks'......(Recall Twitter) - it is difficult to forecast and guide - so when they do they set themselves up for failure - but anyone trading these names understands that.....and if they don't - they do now.....
"
589,COP,"US futures are up 6 points....not surprising after being down 21 points yesterday.....with the S&P 500 now broken its short term support at 2090 - look for that to become resistance again......support is now at 2070ish......
"
590,COP,"It is May 1st...so expect to hear the 'sell in May and go away' mantra - as historians come out of the woodwork telling us about this phenomenon......This is a well known trading adage - essentially telling investors to take the summer off......
"
591,COP,"Economic data today includes April ISM Manufacturing - expectations of 52. March Construction Spending of +0.5% and University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment survey...expectations of 96...on the earnings front - look for Weyerhauser (WY), CVS Health (CVS), Legg Mason (LM), VF (VFC) to name just a few.
"
592,COP,"Also, watch for 2 Fed speakers today....Loretta Mester (Cleveland Fed) at 8:30 a.m. ETand John Williams (San Francisco) at 3:20 p.m. - of the two - Williams is the one that has the potential to create more noise.....

596,COP,"This is the season of college graduations, and many people may be wondering what kinds of gifts would be most appropriate for young people leaving the world of academia and heading out to face the challenges and opportunities of adulthood in the real world. Given the narrow range of left to far-left views of the world on most college campuses,…
"
597,COP,"Lawlessness: Fueled by this president's anti-police policies and race-baiting rhetoric, thugs are attacking cops and terrorizing major cities. Horrible violence is breaking out all over. We are witnessing a national crime wave.Law enforcement expects to see an escalation in criminal activity over the summer. Already we've seen a disturbing trend in May, including: The deadliest month Baltimore has seen in more than 15 years, with almost 30 shootings and nine deaths just over the holiday weekend. That makes well over 100 murders this year, compared with 71 at this time last year, the fastest the city has reached 100 homicides since 2007. Any time Baltimore officers respond to calls on the city's west side, scene of the Freddie Gray riots, as many as 50 people threaten them, Police Chief Anthony Batts says. ""We have to send out multiple units just to do basic police work,"" he said. ""It makes it very difficult to follow up on violence that takes place there."" In Melbourne, Fla., likewise, police have reported mobs surrounding and striking cops trying to handcuff suspects in two separate cases in the past two weeks. A similar spike in violence was reported in Chicago, where 12 people were killed and at least 44 — including a 4-year-old girl — wounded in mostly gang-related shootings over the Memorial Day weekend. In Manhattan, 16 people have been murdered this year, a 45% jump over the same period last year, while the number of shooting victims nearly doubled, from 33 to 61. That doesn't include a rash of Central Park muggings, subway assaults and vandalism. In the nation's capital, the so-called ""D.C. Mansion Murders"" have gripped the city, which is suffering a similar surge in homicides. V In Omaha, Neb., a white female police officer was shot and killed by a black gang member as she tried to serve him a felony arrest warrant. A New Orleans housing authority cop, also white, was gunned down as he sat in his patrol car — the first on-duty death in the department's history. In Rio Rancho, N.M., another white police officer was gunned down after pulling over a gang member during a traffic stop — the first officer shot and killed in the line of duty in the department's 34-year history.Victims can blame the crime surge on politicians who give criminals ""space"" to break the law. Who order cops to stop ""stop and frisks."" Who tie their hands while giving thugs license to loot and kill.Called ""racists,"" officers' morale is in the sewer. Cops fear for their safety and worry about being unfairly accused of using excessive force against black criminals.New York's liberal mayor is even calling for ""amnesty"" for criminals with outstanding warrants, on recommendation from President Obama's police reform task force, which also urges police to ""de-escalate and retreat"" when trying to arrest violent offenders.Obama, meanwhile, has unilaterally disarmed local police by banning military-style antiriot gear.This is a recipe for the national crime wave we predicted in January 2009. Then, we editorialized that ""Obama may have to deal with a crime wave the likes of which we haven't seen in decades,"" thanks to his soft-on-crime urban policies.Regrettably, crime was an issue left undebated during the last two presidential races. It should move front and center this campaign.

613,COP,"Were the Ferguson protests a spontaneous expression of community outrage or an orchestrated campaign with paid ""protesters""? It's looking more and more like the latter.

"

"
617,COP,"Now some of the ""protesters"" themselves are complaining that they never got paid.
"
618,COP,"In mid-May, Millennial Activists United organized a sit-in at the Missourians Organizing for Reform and Empowerment offices. The reason: MORE owed the protesters money.
"
619,COP,"The group complained that MORE ""created a joint account in which national donors from all over the world have donated over $150,000 to sustain the movement,"" but ""the poor black people of this movement ... have seen little to none of that money.""
"
620,COP,"A letter posted by the group went on to claim, ""Organizers and protesters depleted $50,000 of the available funds and dispersed it among the people in the movement in no particular order."" They even started a Twitter hashtag to encourage MORE to cough up the money: #cutthecheck.

It's looking more and more like the latter.Early on, there were signs that protests over the shooting of an unarmed black man by a white cop were less than meets the eye.In December, IBD noted that most of the protesters getting arrested weren't local residents but people bussed in from groups like the New Black Panthers, the U.S. Human Rights Network and the ANSWER Coalition.Later, after the riots in Baltimore erupted, Fox News reported that as many as 50 social media accounts were tied to both those and the Ferguson protests, suggesting the presence of ""professional protesters.""Now some of the ""protesters"" themselves are complaining that they never got paid.In mid-May, Millennial Activists United organized a sit-in at the Missourians Organizing for Reform and Empowerment offices. The reason: MORE owed the protesters money.The group complained that MORE ""created a joint account in which national donors from all over the world have donated over $150,000 to sustain the movement,"" but ""the poor black people of this movement ... have seen little to none of that money.""A letter posted by the group went on to claim, ""Organizers and protesters depleted $50,000 of the available funds and dispersed it among the people in the movement in no particular order."" They even started a Twitter hashtag to encourage MORE to cough up the money: #cutthecheck.There's nothing wrong with protesters getting paid. It's a free country, and they have to make a living, too. But maybe these protesters should think about joining a union before they hit the streets next time.Follow John Merline on Twitter: @IBD_JMerline.

631,COP,"Manufacturing's recent rough patch lingered into early spring, a set of reports released Wednesday revealed.The Institute for Supply Management's March index slid 1.4 points to 51.5, the lowest in nearly two years. The export orders gauge sank another point to 47.5, its third straight month below the 50 mark that signals contraction. The new orders index fell 0.7 point to 51.8. And the jobs reading lost 1.4 points, touching 50.The jobs weakness was echoed by the ADP employment survey, which showed March private payrolls rose by 189,000, the weakest since January 2014. Manufacturers shed some 7,000 jobs, the first cuts since the Polar Vortex at the start of last year. Factors ranging from declining energy sector activity to winter weather took a toll in March, survey respondents told ISM, even as some were upbeat. ""March business is improving over Jan-Feb, thawing out of this crazy winter,"" one said. Several referenced ongoing supply chain interruptions from the West Coast ports work slowdown, which ended in mid-February.""There are so many balls in the air right now,"" said Jennifer Lee, senior economist for BMO Capital Markets.Lee largely blames a stronger dollar for the recent economic sluggishness. The buck is expected to keep rising as the Fed gets set to raise rates while other central banks ease aggressively. Still, she believes energy sector retrenchment has widespread ""spillover"" effects. Orders for durable goods sank 1.4% in February, the Commerce Department said last week. Orders excluding transportation fell for a fifth straight month. Companies including Caterpillar (CAT) and ConocoPhillips (COP) have said they will cut capital spending as oil prices hover at half their 2014 levels.The recent weakness in manufacturing and energy has been accompanied by other economic data that's frustrated analysts. Consumers remain cautious. Despite solid gains in income and wages in February, the savings rate popped to a two-year high.On the upside, U.S. auto sales picked up in March, automakers said Wednesday, fueled by SUVs,pickups and luxury vehicles.But the ISM and ADP reports worried investors Wednesday.The S&P 500 fell 0.4%, well off session lows. The 10-year Treasury yield retreated.ADP's data are not always a good guide of Labor Department data, Action Economics' Chief Economist Michael Englund wrote in a note, but job gains still ""face downside risk"" from everything from lower business sentiment to a slower pace of auto production. Analysts expect a rise of 247,000 jobs in Labor's March employment report on Friday.Wednesday's jobs figures were ""disappointing,"" Lee said, ""but the jobless rate is still at a 6 1/2 year low. Wages will start to pick up. At the end of the day as long as you have a job that's the supporting factor behind consumer spending and consumer spending is what drives the U.S. economy.""

632,COP,"After the mysterious death of suspect Freddie Gray, the Maryland state's attorney for Baltimore charged all six Baltimore police officers who participated in his arrest and transport.

The charges followed three days of riots triggered…
"
633,COP,"Law And Order: Just two months ago, President Obama held up the Baltimore police force as a model of unbiased community policing. Now he's investigating it for civil-rights violations. What's changed?In a March White House report on police reforms, Obama and his Task Force on 21st Century Policing praised Baltimore's force and its black chief for ""implementing national best practices for policies and training,"" including ""use of force"" reforms. His task force even quoted Baltimore Police Commissioner Anthony Batts, who said he changed ""outdated procedures"" that ""put officers at odds with the community.""Yet now the Obama Justice Department is investigating the Baltimore police for a ""pattern or practice of discriminating"" against the black community in ""arrests, traffic stops and other operations."" The federal probe is separate from an ongoing federal inquiry into the death of Freddie Gray, which focuses on the alleged misconduct of six Baltimore cops involved in his arrest, half of whom are black.It's absurd to think that black police officers under the direction of a black police chief are inherently biased against young black men. So why does Obama keep charging police bias where mixed-race juries weighing all the evidence conclude there is none?He was just as wrong in Sanford, Fla., where he and his attorney general scolded local police for not charging George Zimmerman with murder, as he was in Ferguson, Mo., and Queens, N.Y.Why does he keep launching investigations into police discrimination and portraying cops as rabid racists? Because these probes provide a political justification for federalizing local police forces.Last week, Obama said he's dispatching federal civil-rights officials to retrain cops in ""every city and jurisdiction around the country"" to be more culturally sensitive to urban blacks. This so-called de-biasing retraining, according to the same White House report, centers on ""respecting"" black perpetrators and teaching ""de-escalation and tactical retreat skills"" when confronting them in high-crime areas.In other words, giving people space to break the law, which also means giving them space to ambush and kill cops. Five NYPD cops already are believed to have been shot by African-American criminals in just the past five months. Last week, 25-year-old officer Brian Moore was fatally shot in the head, allegedly by career criminal Demetrius Blackwell, while sitting in his car.FBI crime data over the past decade show that African-Americans commit a disproportionately high 40% of all cop-killings — more than three times their representation in the population — yet this administration is forcing local police to lower their guard when dealing with blacks in crime-infested urban areas.The policing reforms he's already forcing on more than 20 police departments across the country — including Seattle, Cleveland, Las Vegas, Newark, N.J., New Orleans, Philadelphia and Ferguson — are based on the studies of social psychologist Lorie Fridell, who argues legal definitions of unlawful discrimination are ""outdated"" and should be broadened to include even unquantifiable prejudice against people of color that occurs ""outside our conscious awareness.""While she admits the link between blacks and violent crime is statistically strong — African-Americans commit 53% of all murders and are 10 times more likely to commit violent crimes than whites — she trains cops to resist that ""stereotype"" through what the White House calls ""counter-stereotyping.""According to her PowerPoint presentations, Fridell recommends routinely testing cops for ""implicit"" or ""unconscious"" bias and ""unlearning"" their experience associating blacks with crime.By retraining cops' minds to perceive blacks as less of a threat, Fridell and Obama hope they'll be less likely to use lethal force against black suspects. Fridell recommends banning all criminal profiling that takes a suspect's race into account.By criminalizing crime-fighting, Obama is not only endangering more cops' lives but those of citizens they're sworn to protect.

646,COP,"Freedom: After a Muhammad cartoon event was attacked in Texas, the intelligentsia pointed the finger at the organizers. Let's get one thing straight: This event was not about guns, civility or Islam. It was about free speech.Activist Pamela Geller is no stranger to saying things that horrify the politically correct. She protested the World Trade Center mosque and bought bus-sign ads describing what's really written in the Quran. Last weekend, she and writer Robert Spencer's American Freedom Defense Initiative organized a contest for the best Muhammad cartoon drawing with a $10,000 prize in Texas in response to the Islamofascist newsroom massacre of cartoonists in Paris at the French paper Charlie Hebdo earlier this year.And to no one's surprise in a nation whose leaders consider rising Islamofascist terror groups ""junior varsity"" and where extremist depravities are viewed as ""workplace violence"" or dismissed as reactions to bad filmmaking rather than organized terror, a couple of Islamofacists from North Phoenix, Ariz., shot up the Garland, Texas, cartoon conference, wounding a security guard before an off-duty traffic cop took the pair down and saved the country from another massacre.Since then, it's been Charlie Hebdo all over again, given the media's failure to understand that this is about the threat that radical Islam poses to free speech.Incredibly, the left wasted no time blasting Geller and Spender, blaming them for the murderous behavior of the gunmen.CNN's Alisyn Camerota attacked Geller as anti-Islamic, cherry-picking various news clips to make her case, despite Geller asserting that she wasn't.""Civilized men can disagree,"" Geller told CNN. ""Savages will kill you when they disagree.""Why she should be on the hot seat instead of the would-be attackers and their enablers is beyond us.But the finger-pointing at Geller kept coming.""Free speech aside, why would anyone do something as provocative as hosting a 'Muhammad drawing contest'?"" tweeted New York Times' Rukmini Callimachi.Free speech aside? From the newspaper of record?Callimachi didn't seem to understand that the entire event — as Geller's participants repeatedly said in the pre-shooting film clips of the event posted on her blog — was explicitly about free speech, which is now under attack by Islamofascists and which can be demonstrated only by extreme means, such as cartoons.And that's the heart of the matter. Agree with Geller or not, there can be no compromise on free speech. The attack on her event underscored the fragility of America's free speech, the basis for all of America's freedoms.

650,COP,"Racial Politics: President Obama has a tendency to wade into local crime cases, second-guessing police decisions and making wild accusations of racism, without knowing all the facts. Baltimore is his latest faux pas.Obama strongly suggested that Baltimore police were to blame for the death of a young black man who died while in custody.Freddie Gray, a 25-year-old convicted drug dealer who'd been arrested 18 times previously, resisted another arrest April 12. He was so violent, he required additional restraints and a paddy wagon to take him to jail.""Our laws were not applied evenly in the case of Mr. Gray,"" Obama intoned, ""and accountability needs to exist.""He presumed that Gray had had ""his spine snapped"" while struggling with cops. But once again, it looks like the president spoke prematurely.A police report leaked to the Washington Post shows that Gray likely caused his own injuries by banging his head against the wall of the police transport van in a tirade over his bust.The report quotes another prisoner in the van who observed, ""(He) was intentionally trying to injure himself.""A local ABC News affiliate, meanwhile, reports that the medical examiner found that Gray's fatal injury was caused when he slammed into the back of the van, apparently breaking his neck.""A head injury he sustained matches a bolt in the back of the van,"" the report said.In other words, Gray wasn't paralyzed during the confrontation with police. The president jumped to the wrong conclusion, along with civil-rights agitators.There was a similar rush to judgment in the Michael Brown case, when Obama and his attorney general reinforced the black community's belief that the 18-year-old African-American was gunned down by a white cop as he surrendered, hands up. It didn't happen that way.Yet Ferguson, like Baltimore, burned. And Obama hasn't learned from that tragic error.""Since Ferguson, we have seen too many instances of what appears to be police officers interacting with individuals — primarily African American, often poor — in ways that have raised troubling questions,"" he said.""And it comes up, it seems like, once every couple of weeks .. . . This is a crisis ... . This has been going on for a long time. This is not new, and we shouldn't pretend that it's new.""He's right about there being a crisis. But black crime, not police bias or brutality, is at the heart of it. The only one pretending otherwise is the president.

652,COP,"Cabinet: If there's a government agency that ought to stay above the political fray, it's the Justice Department. But outgoing Attorney General Eric Holder used his department to pursue a racially polarizing political agenda.In his farewell speech Friday at Justice, Holder asserted that he restored Justice ""to what it always was — free of politicization and focused on the mission without any kind of interference from political outsiders.""This from the man who just last year proudly described himself as ""an activist attorney general.""In that same 2014 interview with Juan Williams, Holder admitted that he turned the civil rights division into a political weapon, adding ""(I am) proud of it.""""The responsibility of the attorney general is to change things,"" he asserted.Gee, and here we thought it was to apply the law equally.When he took office in 2009, Holder immediately signaled he would do the opposite.Career prosecutors brought to him an open-and-shut case of voter intimidation against club-wielding thugs of the New Black Panthers, who in 2008 tried to bully white voters at a Philadelphia polling place into voting for Obama. But Holder dismissed the case.He made it clear that he was only there to prosecute white people who intimidate black people, not the other way around. He had no intention of protecting the voting rights of every American, just the voting rights of select groups.And in an overtly political speech, he attacked America for being ""a nation of cowards"" for not seeing the same racist bogeymen he and his boss see lurking behind virtually every corner.Yet it was Holder who six years later still can't bring himself to talk about black-on-black murder — the real problem plaguing the inner city. The real cowardice was his refusal to address the young black fratricide in Chicago and other major cities.No, Holder didn't have the stomach to talk about that; because if he did, he'd have to address the welfare-induced, anti-family pathologies leading so many young black men to commit suicide by gang or suicide by cop.Holder only fed these pathologies by ginning up racism in Sanford, Fla., and Ferguson, Mo. He knew better. He was agitating, whipping up the mob to get out the black vote ahead of the 2012 and 2014 elections.""Mr. Holder was not beyond using scare tactics against minorities to win re-election,"" ex-Justice Department lawyer J. Christian Adams said. In fact, his ""job was to scare and mobilize minorities.""Adams also cites Holder's launch of a 2012 campaign against voter ID in South Carolina and other states with large black voter bases, in which he compared voter ID laws to the ""poll tax.""""Without a racially polarized and activated base,"" Adams said, ""Mr. Obama could not have won in 2012.""Holder also stacked his department with fellow activists, pushing out career lawyers ""to fill the rank-and-file with leftist lawyers,"" Adams said.The supposedly apolitical attorney general rejected his own inspector general's recommendation against hiring lawyers from left-wing civil rights groups, such as the Students of Color Coalition, the Black Organization of Soul Sisters, the Poverty and Race Research Action Council, the Workers' Center of Racial Justice and the NAACP Legal Defense Fund.Yet Holder has the gall to claim in a ""legacy"" video posted on Justice's website, ""Attorney General Eric Holder: People's Attorney,"" that he ""depoliticized Justice Department hiring practices.""Holder was the first African American to be named the nation's top cop, a welcome and poignant milestone in our troubled history.But to the nation's detriment, he proved a polarizing, race-baiting radical who conducted himself in the most dishonest manner, enforcing the law for some groups and not for others.Holder injected politics into the law at every turn, leaving a legacy of racial scare tactics and division.

659,COP,"The Obama administration as soon as today will unveil new federal regulations on fracking, which has turned America in an energy powerhouse and slashed the price of oil and natural gas, but raised some environmental concerns.That will affect global energy giants such as Exxon Mobil (XOM) as well as domestic players such as Continental Resources (CLR) and Sanchez Energy (SN).The Interior Department rules on fracking, or hydraulic fracturing, will require new rules on well integrity, dealing with wastewater and disclosing chemicals used in the process.The rules will only apply to federal and Indian tribal lands. Existing state and local rules will remain in force. The bulk of increased oil production in recent years has been on private and state land.Interior initially proposed changes in 2012, with rules expected by year-end. That was pushed back, with a new draft proposal issued in May 2013. Interior Secretary Sally Jewell said earlier this week that the rules would finally be released within ""days.""As then, industry groups are expected to say that the rules are unnecessary and excessive, while environmentalists say the regulations should go further.The administration has said the cost would be minimal for industry. Industry begs to differ.Energy Companies Slash Jobs, SpendingShale companies are struggling, with the price of oil falling from above $100 a barrel last June to just above $40 now. Drilling activity has plunged, mostly in marginal areas, spurring oil services companies Baker Hughes (BHI), Halliburton (HAL) and Schlumberger (SLB) have announced job cuts.

660,COP,"Foreign Policy: By removing Cuba from the list of state sponsors of terrorism, President Obama is letting Castro get away with harboring and pampering anti-American terrorists on the FBI's Most Wanted Terrorists List.Earlier this week, Obama removed Cuba from the State Department's blacklist — even though State documents Cuba's long history of sponsoring terrorists. And even though Havana shelters and refuses to turn over American fugitives.Obama chose not to seek their extradition from Havana in exchange for his latest gift to the communist thug. One of the terrorists sits on the FBI's list — right alongside al-Qaida leader Ayman al-Zawahiri.Joanne Deborah Chesimard, aka Assata Shakur, has a $1 million bounty on her after escaping from a New Jersey prison while serving a life sentence for murdering a state trooper and shooting another with two comrades.""One trooper was wounded and the other was shot and killed execution-style at point-blank range,"" the FBI says, adding that Chesimard ""is thought to currently still be living in Cuba."" The White House claims Cuba ""met the conditions for rescinding its designation as a state sponsor of terrorism.""Really? Tell that to the FBI or the families of the state troopers Chesimard gunned down.Even State, in its latest report on state sponsors of terrorism, warns: ""The Cuban government continued to harbor fugitives wanted in the United States (and) provided support such as housing, food rations, books and medical care for these individuals.""Castro considers the cop-killing fugitive Chesimard, the first woman on the FBI's Most Wanted Terrorist list, a ""political prisoner."" He refused to return the violent Marxist to the U.S.It would have been easy to convince Castro to hand her over given the incentives. Removing Cuba from the terror list removes a major obstacle for economic and other aid. It also gives Castro's regime diplomatic influence in Washington, while paving the way for the reopening of embassies for the first time in 54 years.So why didn't Obama press the issue? Perhaps for the same reason he and his race-mongering attorney general have gone easy on the militant, voter-intimidating New Black Panthers, and even tried to appoint a lawyer for and passionate defender of a cop-killing Black Panther to a top post at the Justice Department.Chesimard is a member of the Black Liberation Army, which is composed largely of Black Panthers. BLA fights for ""anti-capitalism,"" ""anti-imperialism"" and ""anti-racism,"" and has carried out more than 70 acts of violence to advance its cause.State's recent report also cites Cuba for providing ""safe haven"" for some two dozen ETA (Basque Fatherland and Liberty) terrorists, as well as FARC (Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia) terrorists.ETA has bombed government buildings in Europe and killed more than 800 people since 1968. And Castro-sponsored FARC's attacks on Colombia have cost some 200,000 lives since 1964.FARC's deadly attack on 10 Colombian troops this week — violence that broke a cease-fire and peace-talk deal — shows it's still getting weapons and money. Castro has long aided this Marxist insurgency in Colombia. And State notes in its terror report that Havana has formally inserted itself in conflict talks since 2013.Meanwhile, in February, the Colombian navy intercepted a Havana-bound Chinese ship loaded with small arms of the kind terrorists use. Colombia's military initially announced that they thought the ship was there to supply FARC weapons before sailing on to Havana.Amnesty for Castro's terrorist-harboring regime has long been the dream of Obama's Castro-loving mentor, Rev. Jeremiah Wright, who was part of the 1984 entourage to Havana crying ""Viva Fidel!"" and ""Viva Che Guevara!"" just two years after Reagan designated Cuba a terror sponsor.Wright must be so proud of his apostle.

661,COP,"Houston home sales fell in February for the first time in six months, a sign that lower oil prices are spooking buyers. Sales of single-family houses in the area dropped 5.8% from a year earlier to 4,521 homes, the Houston Association of Realtors reported this week.Purchases fell among residences costing less than $150,000 because of a tight supply of homes in that range, and among properties selling for more than $500,000 as wealthier buyers paused amid economic uncertainty, said James Gaines, research economist at the Texas A&M University real estate center.""They don't know what the real impact of falling oil prices is,"" Gaines said in a telephone interview from College Station, Texas. ""We're living in the twilight of uncertainty.""Oil's A Big EmployerHouston, capital of the U.S. oil industry, is home to the headquarters of companies such as ConocoPhillips (COP) and Halliburton (HAL), which have been hurt by the plunge in crude prices since last year.Halliburton said last month that it's cutting 8% of its global workforce of more than 80,000. Houston-based Cal Dive International, a marine contractor for the oil industry, filed for bankruptcy protection last week.Michele Marano, an agent with Champions Real Estate Group and a former energy commodity broker, says that the housing market has softened because buyers are taking their time.""Since oil has been down, there has been a pause in our market — people are more cautious,"" said Marano, who specializes in houses for professionals working in the energy industry.""People know right now that time is on the buyers' side,"" she added.Listings increased 0.7% from a year earlier to 27,990 properties, the Houston Association of Realtors reported on Wednesday. Inventory remains tight at 2.7 months of supply, compared with 4.7% nationally.Exxon Mobil's New DigsMarano says that she's in the market for a new home in the Woodlands, a high-end, master-planned community near where a new Exxon Mobil (XOM) corporate campus is being built, and she's waiting for prices to drop before buying.""There's a lot of brand-new construction, and it's not like it's moving fast,"" Marano said.""When we look at houses, the selling agent calls me back 10 times asking if we will come in again,"" she added.Home sales also are expected to suffer in Texas cities such as Midland-Odessa, San Antonio and Corpus Christi — where oil drilling and some related services play a big role in the local economies, Gaines said.Slowing sales may not be completely negative for Houston, which has had one of the nation's hottest real estate markets, he said.Last year, 83,160 homes sold in the area, surpassing the previous record in 2006.""A 6% decline is still a good year,"" Gaines said. ""But it'll take six to 12 months before the full impact is felt.""

662,COP,"Leadership: The sight of President Obama glad-handing Cuban dictator Raul Castro showed just how far American diplomacy has sunk. Far from being a Nixon-goes-to-China moment, this was a craven capitulation.There's a reason 10 presidents of both parties kept Cuba's Castros on America's bad-guys' list for more than 50 years. Each leader understood a basic truth: Totalitarian Cuba is a sworn enemy of the U.S., a violent threat to the Western Hemisphere's peace and prosperity and an ally of our worst enemies — including the former USSR.Hearing an American president now apologize — as Obama did over the weekend at the Summit of the Americas — for past U.S. efforts to protect our homeland and our militarily weak neighbors from Cuba's aggression is bizarre and disgraceful.No move to repair ties with the Castro regime should have been made until that country agreed to real, major reforms — including the release of all political prisoners, restoration of basic human rights to Cubans and the dismantling of Cuba's totalitarian communist state.Instead, Obama got nothing. And he used cringe-inducing, obsequious language to apologize to Raul Castro and others for past U.S. behavior, speaking of the ""dark chapters"" in our history and ruefully noting ""we have not always observed the principles and ideals upon which the country was founded.""Relying on a supine media and public ignorance about Cuba, Obama claims Americans favor resuming ties with Cuba. Indeed, a recent poll by InterAmerican Security Watch seems to back normalization 51% to 38%.But as Mark Thiessen noted in the Washington Post, ""when Americans are told that Cuba is hosting Russian ships in its harbors, opposition to normalization jumps to 58% while support sinks to 30%. When Americans are told of Cuba's attempts to smuggle 240 tons of weaponry to North Korea, opposition jumps to 63% and support drops to 26%."" Similar results come when Americans are told that Cuba still harbors terrorists, including convicted U.S. cop killer Joanne Chesimard.""When Americans hear basic facts about Castro's hostility and human rights violations, they know that the president's unilateral concessions only emboldened a dangerous, despotic regime,"" said American Enterprise Institute fellow Roger Noriega, a former U.S. assistant secretary of state, who commissioned the Cuba poll.According to R.J. Rummel, the late professor of political science at the University of Hawaii, Fidel and Raul Castro killed as many as 141,000 people from 1959 to 1987 — not counting those who drowned or were eaten by sharks trying to escape the island prison. Even today, thousands of political prisoners rot behind bars.Yet Obama says ""the U.S. will not be imprisoned by the past,"" referring to the Cold War.Fact is, Cuba's regime remains a repeat violator of human rights, a destroyer of its own once-vibrant economy and a supporter of terrorism worldwide.To give Cuba diplomatic recognition and erase 56 years of efforts by previous presidents for nothing in return goes beyond foolish — it looks like a policy that's intended to make the U.S. look pathetic and weak, and to damage its long-term interests. Is that what this is?

699,COP,"Terrorism: Seeking applause at a summit in Panama, President Obama vowed to swiftly remove Cuba as a state sponsor of terror. It just shows how his foreign policy runs — for political convenience, not national security.As he headed off to the Summit of the Americas in Panama, President Obama tossed a tidbit for the region's tyrants that's expected to be a crowd-pleaser: A vow to quickly lift the State Department's designation of Cuba as a state sponsor of terror.The move would let the communist dictatorship buy weapons from the U.S., gain dual-use technologies, end some financial sanctions and open Cuba to foreign aid.And as for whether Cuba really was a state sponsor of terror and a threat to the U.S., well, that was secondary. Given the huge number of State Department political appointees, an independent assessment isn't possible.Pressure to lift the designation has come from the Cuban regime as a precondition for opening a U.S. embassy in Havana. Obama said he hoped to open it by the April 10-11 summit. It's also come as Cuban client Venezuela has tried to force the U.S. to lift sanctions on its corrupt officials. More free stuff for Cuba in the form of lifting this sanction, with nothing asked in return, might just take the edge off.Speaking in an interview Tuesday with National Public Radio, President Obama said the only reason he hasn't lifted the terrorist designation already was that he was waiting for a State Department report.""As soon as I get a recommendation, I'll be in a position to act on it,"" Obama told NPR.That says a lot about what's wrong with his foreign policy. It's not about facts on the ground, historic precedent or, heaven forbid, national security or U.S. interests. It's about being popular with dictators, pleasing his supporters, and ""making history."" In short, politics.The reality is that the Cuban regime has a dangerous, half-century history as a state sponsor of terror. Cuba was the originator of the 51-year terror war in Colombia, with Cuban ""revolutionaries"" providing training for FARC as well as the ELN, a terror group it founded.It launched a reign of terror in Chile in the 1970s and Cuba's violent agents and their acts were the basis for ""the dirty war"" across South America at that time.Cuba also fomented and fostered terrorism in Europe, providing arms and haven to Spain's Basque ETA and Northern Ireland's Irish Republican Army.In 1964, Cuba planned the first 9/11 — a massive terror attack in the subways under Bloomingdale's, Macy's and other retailers on the busiest shopping day of the year in New York City, in a plot foiled by the FBI.The Cuban regime also harbors U.S. fugitives who have engaged in terrorist acts. As recently as 2007, the State Department estimated that Cuba shelters about 70 cop-killers, revolutionaries, hijackers and other criminals, and has refused to return them to justice.Call it ancient history, but remember that these are people Obama's now dealing with.Sure, the Castro brothers today rely on elected leftists to become dictators in democracy's clothing. But they still engage in terror. Cuban agents run Venezuela's identification system, its electrical system, its internal spies, its agriculture and much of its military.These aren't mere advisers, but trainers of Venezuela's violent, armed, drug-trafficking paramilitaries, called ""colectivos,"" who also terrorize Venezuela's dissidents, according to Mauricio Claver-Carone, writing in the World Affairs journal.""Last month's executive order by Obama declaring Venezuela as a national security threat and sanctioning seven senior government officials — with well-known links to Cuba's military and security services . . . underscores this menace,"" he wrote. More to the point, last year, Cuba was caught red-handed with 240 tons of heavy weaponry headed for North Korea.Last February, a Chinese-flagged ship bound for Havana was caught in Cartagena, Colombia, with an unregistered cargo of 100 tons of gunpowder, 2.6 million detonators, 99 missile heads and 3,000 artillery shells that the Colombian army suspected was meant for FARC. Obama's foreign policy team has mostly been mum. It just wants Cuba off the terror list to get that embassy up and damn the consequences or the kind of damage Cuba can do. It's foreign policy amateur hour.

Diversification, in a way, is a cop-out for expertise.""The more you diversify, the less you know about any one area,"" IBD founder and Chairman William O'Neil wrote in ""How To Make Money In Stocks."" ""The best results are usually achieved through concentration, by putting your eggs in a few baskets that you know well and watching them carefully.""O'Neil suggests investors with portfolios of $20,000 to $200,000 limit themselves to four or five carefully chosen stocks that they know and understand. Portfolios of between $5,000 and $20,000 might need just three stocks. If you are just dipping a toe with a portfolio of $5,000 or less, narrow your watch list down to the two best stocks you can find that are in actionable chart positions.Let's say the market is just coming out of a correction. It sets up a bottom, climbs for a week, then punches higher in heavy trade to mark a follow-through day and launches a new uptrend. An investor with a $50,000 portfolio has his watch list researched and knows exactly which stocks he wants. He makes his buys just as stocks are breaking out in heavy volume, not before the breakout.He decides he will focus on four stocks, so a full position will be $12,500. He has a dozen potential candidates on his watch list, because not all will be breaking out on the follow-through day and he'd like to get in at the start of the rally.He pyramids into each stock, opening with a purchase of, say, $8,500 — two-thirds of a full-size position. In a $25 stock, that means 340 shares. He adds to those positions as each stock proves its strength and moves up through its buy range. By the time the stocks reach 5% above their buy points, each position shows a total cost of $12,500 each.It's easy to fall into the habit of placing bigger bets on some stocks and smaller bets on others at the start of a rally. It is natural to feel more confident in certain stocks. But investors should use that confidence as a gauge. If you are feeling less certain, is this really a move you want to make?The fact is, you have no idea which of your initial buys is going to move the highest. If you start a rally on equal footing, you leave yourself free to rotate out of those that prove to be slow movers and move more cash into better plays.The goal, by the end of the rally, is to have your capital concentrated in your two or three best advancers — not spread among two dozen or more small positions showing varying growth.

717,COP,"Lawlessness: The latest casualties in Eric Holder's anti-cop race war are two Ferguson, Mo., officers shot at a protest rally. The ambush follows the attorney general smearing the entire Ferguson police force as racist.'Acknowledgment nine months ago would have kept that from happening!"" one protester shouted, referring to the August police shooting of Michael Brown.""It's time for the (people) to finally fight back against these racist ass pigs!"" another protester tweeted.Just hours earlier, Ferguson's police chief stepped down in response to Holder's 100-page report claiming Ferguson police engaged in systemic racism against local blacks.""Nothing in this travesty of a report proves that, and the fact that Justice produced a report so buffoonish, so replete with conclusions unsupported by facts, so lacking in basic methodological rigor, is an embarrassment,"" blasted U.S. Commission on Civil Rights member Peter Kirsanow, who is black.But ""the report has accomplished its objective,"" Kirsanow added. ""It's smeared police officers across the country, giving the administration excuse to exert greater control over local police departments.""It's also enlarged the target on their backs. Holder excused anti-cop violence that broke out after the Brown shooting, suggesting it was justified by his overall findings.""Members of the community may not have been responding only to a single isolated confrontation, but also to a pervasive, corrosive and deeply unfortunate lack of trust — attributable to ... abuses, unreasonable searches and seizures, and excessive and dangerous use of force ... against African Americans,"" he said, only encouraging more violence against cops.Remember: The first casualties in Holder's war on cops were the two New York Police Department officers assassinated in December by a young black man seeking revenge for what Holder claimed were racially motivated police shootings of black men.Before Ismaaiyl Brinsley ambushed and killed the NYPD cops as they sat in their cruiser, Holder personally egged on anti-cop protesters in St. Louis and New York with his race rhetoric. He even huddled with racial arsonist Al Sharpton to coordinate an agitation campaign as he did in Sanford, Fla., after the Trayvon Martin shooting.Holder insisted that law enforcement do not treat black citizens fairly, that they profile young black men in particular. Blacks have good reason to distrust police, he said, given the history of discrimination in America.Holder even said he's been personally harassed by police and has counseled his son to be wary of cops. He announced that he was doubling the number of civil rights investigations of police departments, already numbering 20.Message: The Ferguson police, NYPD and many other police forces across the country are a bunch of racists; and if you are black, you may be in their cross hairs.So now we have two racially charged cop ambushes, and the blood of these victims is on Holder's hands. It's clear he has a personal grudge against cops and that he wrote his specious report to confirm his own biases.Now he says he's sorry the cops got shot in the backlash he fueled. But does he really find the attacks ""repugnant""? Do they really ""turn"" his stomach?After all, this is the same man who tried to hire the top defender of unrepentant cop-killer Mumia Abu-Jamal as his civil rights chief, and who has refused to seek the death penalty for four black cop-killers in Virginia.And now he won't demand the extradition of cop-killer Joanne Chesimard from Cuba, despite normalized relations. She and Abu-Jamal were Black Panthers, the same militant group Holder refused to prosecute for trying to intimidate white voters into voting for Obama in the 2008 election.Holder has his own ""unconscious bias,"" as he likes to accuse cops of having, and we fear it runs deeper than just smearing cops as racist.

718,COP,"Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) CEO Ben van Beurden said oil demand may outpace supply growth, sending crude futures up Thursday. Van Beurden said that oil prices will increase in the next few years if production projects are canceled.Oil price recovery could ""occur if projects are postponed or even canceled,"" he said in prepared remarks. ""This would lead to less new supply—not so much now, but in two or three years. Combined with economic growth, the market could tighten quickly in this scenario.""If output stays steady despite the drop in prices ""prices could stay low for longer,"" van Beurden said.Linn Energy (LINE), Laredo Petroleum (LPI) and Sanchez Energy (SN) cut their capital spending forecasts for the year while Continental Resources (CLR) said it won't add any new drilling rigs. Oil majors are also feeling the squeeze. ConocoPhillips (COP) lowered its 2015 capital spending budget by 20%. On Thursday, France's Total SA (TOT) said it will cut its capital expenditures by 10% to $23 billion-$24 billion in 2015 and plans to cut 2,000 jobs to help cut costs. The oil company reported a $5.66 billion net loss last quarter.Shell shares were up 0.9% at 65.25 by early afternoon in the stock market today, although it had traded a bit higher Thursday morning.Brent crude jumped 4% to $56.87 per barrel. U.S. crude climbed 3% to $50.41.A falling dollar also helped boost crude prices. U.S. crude fell earlier Thursday after Genscape reported a boost in crude stockpiles in Cushing, Okla.Van Beurden also said that big oil should have a louder voice on climate change.""In the past we thought it was better to keep a low profile on the issue. It's not a good tactic. We have to make sure that our voice is heard by members of government, by civil society and the general public.""Exxon Mobil (XOM) has been vocal about climate change and its potential risks.Follow Gillian Rich on Twitter: @IBD_GRich.

719,COP,"Law And Order: As President Obama's government wages its War on Cops, a new report finds a 56% jump in cop-killings — many ambushed and shot by black suspects, just like the two NYPD officers executed in Brooklyn.The mainstream media have written off the Dec. 20 shooting deaths of NYPD officers Wenjian Liu and Rafael Ramos as an ""isolated incident,"" arguing the real threat is from white cops ""targeting"" black men.They say their black killer, Ismaaiyl Abdullah Brinsley, was ""deranged"" when he sneaked up to their parked patrol car and shot them in the head. They dismissed his vengeful act as a ""one-off"" or ""lone"" event.In fact, Liu and Ramos were two of 50 law enforcement officers shot and killed in the line of duty in 2014. That number is up 56% from 2013, when 32 gun-related police deaths were reported, according to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund.Brinsley was hardly alone in targeting and ambushing police. His attack was more of a copycat crime. ""Fifteen officers were shot and killed in ambush, more than any other circumstance of fatal shootings, in 2014,"" said the Washington-based police fund.The White House and its press popinjays have made great hay of the racial element in the Ferguson, Mo., and Staten Island, N.Y., cases involving black suspects who died while resisting arrest.But they completely overlook the race factor in recent shootings of police. Here is a sampling: December: Marco Antonio Parilla Jr. allegedly shot and killed — and even ran over — Tarpon Springs (Fla.) officer Charles Kondek after the former NYPD cop responded to a noise complaint at a home near Tampa. Parilla, 23, is biracial, while Kondek, 45, was white. July: Police say Lawrence Campbell, a 27-year-old African-American, ambushed and murdered Jersey City, N.J., police officer Melvin Santiago and his partner after they answered a robbery-in-progress call at a drugstore. Santiago, 23, was gunned down in a hail of bullets fired by the ex-con, who moments earlier boasted to a bystander he was ""going to be famous."" July: Carl Le'Ellis Blount Jr., a 25-year-old black man, was charged in the shooting death of Gary, Ind., police officer Jeffrey Westerfield, who was white. Westerfield was responding to a shots-fired call in a domestic dispute when Blount allegedly shot him while he sat in his squad car. The officer, who would have turned 47 that day, never even pulled his weapon before he was shot in the head. July: Authorities say Major Davis Jr. shot and killed Indianapolis police officer Perry Renn after the 25-year-old black suspect brandished an assault rifle and Renn and another officer confronted him. Davis refused orders to put the gun down, and a five-minute gun battle ensued. Twenty-two-year veteran Renn, who was white, died shortly after being struck by bullets, while Davis survived surgery from his gunshot wounds. June: Two young black men — Quintylan Richard, 20, and Baylon Taylor, 19 — allegedly murdered Vermilion Parish, La., Sheriff's Deputy Allen Bares, as the 51-year-old officer investigated a home break-in. The white officer was shot several times. May: Police say Marvin Louis Guy shot Killeen, Texas, Police Det. Charles ""Chuck"" Dinwiddie in the face as he and SWAT officers served a warrant at his home. Guy is black, Dinwiddie was white. The 50-year-old Guy, who allegedly wounded two other officers in the assault, faces one count of capital murder and three counts of attempted capital murder.Evidence clearly shows police face a lethal and growing threat from black criminals. So when will the pundits talk about this disturbing trend?

723,COP,"Top careers are marked by generosity. How extra effort distinguishes philanthropic leaders: Start now.  When Randy Sutton compiled stories of givers in his book ""The Power of Legacy,"" he discovered a common denominator. Most philanthropic stars had a parent, friend, mentor or teacher they credited with ""paving the way through love, encouragement and example,"" he told IBD.He believes legacy is about the here and now: ""Every tomorrow is born of today, and as our lives brush against the lives of others, the impact can be felt forever."" Commit to it. When Frank Shankwitz launched his Make-A-Wish Foundation in 1980, he was making good on a decades-old promise to a man named Juan.Shankwitz's divorced mom had struggled to make ends meet in rural Arizona during the 1950s, and locals gave the family beans and tortillas. Juan told Frank: ""Someday, when you can, give back. Help other people in need.""Years later, Shankwitz was an Arizona Highway Patrol motorcycle officer tasked with a special assignment: taking a kid with leukemia for a ride on his motorcycle. The youngster's idols were motorcycle cop characters Ponch and John from the hit TV series ""CHiPs.""Shankwitz went the extra mile and had a uniform and a badge specially made for the little rider.Hooked on the feeling, the cop went on to launch Make-A-Wish from his kitchen table. ""I had finally figured out what Juan taught me when I was 10 years old: Give back,"" Shankwitz said.The foundation now has 36 chapters on five continents and has granted 300,000-plus wishes. Keep trying. ""I've always been somebody who doesn't like a lot of chitchat, a lot of talk. I think if you're going to do something, you do it."" So says actor Gary Sinise in ""The Power of Legacy.""Inspired by relatives who served in the military, Sinise supported veterans' causes long before he portrayed Lt. Dan in the 1994 blockbuster movie ""Forrest Gump.""In the 1980s, Sinise launched Vets Night — free dinners and performances for soldiers — with his Steppenwolf Theatre Co. in Chicago. He was also active in the '90s with the Disabled American Veterans charity, and after ""Forrest Gump"" he went on USO handshake tours and formed the Lt. Dan Band to honor and entertain troops with rock concerts. In 2011, he formed the Gary Sinise Foundation to expand his efforts.""While we can never do enough to show our gratitude to our nation's defenders, we can always do a little more,"" Sinise said. Seize a moment. In 2005, Greg Olsen orbited earth on the International Space Station — the third private citizen to do so.Back on earth, he's given out more than 50 college scholarships and spoken to 400 groups — particularly middle school kids — about considering science and engineering careers.An unlikely person set Olsen's career trajectory. At age 17, he went to his father — a hard-drinking, sometimes abusive man — and asked him to sign Army enlistment papers. Instead, the dad who never attended Little League games suggested his son try college for six months. ""Right then, at the most important moment of my life, he was there for me,"" Olsen said.College, particularly science, agreed with Olsen.He'd launch into an entrepreneurial career that included startup Sensors Unlimited.

"
742,COP,"Incitement: Leftist groups, whose inflammatory, racialist rhetoric incited Isamaaiyl Brinsley to kill two New York police officers, have made it clear: They'll keep on sowing hate and divisiveness despite the murders.Democratic leaders, ranging from President Obama and Attorney General Eric Holder to New York Mayor Bill de Blasio and ""civil rights leader"" and MSNBC showman Al Sharpton, have been complicit in whipping angry crowds into a frenzy in recent weeks and months.It came to a head last week at a rally protesting the deaths of Michael Brown and Eric Garner led by Sharpton, where this chant was heard: ""What do we want? Dead cops.""Well, they got their wish. Ismaaiyl Brinsley, the alleged killer who may have had ties to the radical, prison-based Black Guerrilla Family, attended the rally, according to police officials. He took video of the protest, which included threats of violence directed at the police.Obviously agitated, Brinsley put this chilling post on Instagram shortly before NYPD officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu were murdered: ""I'm putting wings on pigs today. They take 1 of ours . .. let's take 2 of theirs,"" an apparent reference to the killing of Brown and Garner by police.There can be no doubt that the demonstrations had a serious impact on Brinsley — and, who knows, maybe others just like him who have yet to act.As such, you might think that even left-wing anti-police groups would have a twinge of conscience following the brutal cold-blooded assassination of two minority New York cops. But you'd be wrong.Sharpton immediately moon-walked away from responsibility, expressing remorse for the deaths but refusing to call off further demonstrations. He did what all demagogues do — he legalistically parsed words: ""Is a vigil a protest?"" he asked. ""Is a rally?""Taking his lead, New York activist groups flatly refused Mayor de Blasio's request to not hold any demonstrations until after the slain officers' funerals. The Answer Coalition, the extreme-left umbrella group that has fueled the protests, called de Blasio's attempt to cool things off ""outrageous.""It wasn't just in New York. Leftist organizers in Ferguson, Mo., where 300-pound petty criminal Michael Brown was killed after attacking a police officer, said they hoped to revive demonstrations in the small town.Bassem Masri, who had the grand distinction of being invited to Holder's Justice Department to consult on police reform, took to the microphone Saturday to mock the murder of the two New York policemen.""Pigs in a blanket,"" he and others chanted, ""smell like bacon."" By the way, Brinsley Instagrammed that first phrase — ""pigs in a blanket"" — before gunning down the two officers as they sat in a police car in Brooklyn.So the obscene assault by the left and their enablers in the Democratic Party on civil society — and the police who stand between us and chaos — continues.And this is more than a little ironic, given new revelations emerging from our federal government about the harrassment of conservative groups by the IRS and others in the Obama government.A new report by Rep. Darrel Issa's House Oversight Committee brings further evidence that IRS employees went after, as one lefty bureaucrat put it, ""icky"" conservative organizations. It's part of a pattern.For the last six years, conservative Tea Party groups and citizens like the wealthy Koch brothers have been vilified and harrassed by the Obama government, the media, left-wing groups and organized labor.Democratic politicians have routinely accused law-abiding conservative groups of harboring violent and racist tendencies. No proof. Just accusations.Meanwhile, Democratic politicians have instigated, led and encouraged the extreme-left demonstrations now spinning out of control. They are, in fact and reality, violent — and have now even led to murder. Where's the outrage about that?That this is happening now should come as no surprise. After six years, it is, sadly, the racially and politically divided America that our failed president has bequeathed.
"
743,COP,"Crime: Talking about a war on cops motivated by race-baiting is mere ""conjecture,"" according to the NAACP, which says that the assassination of two New York cops is an ""example of the need for strict gun-control measures.""After the tragic death of Eric Garner while resisting arrest, Mayor Bill de Blasio told New Yorkers how he had warned his biracial son to be wary of cops who, in any confrontation, might misinterpret his actions in a way they would not with a white suspect. Cops are the enemy, not the criminals they try to protect you from.Well, on Friday night, police were called to the home of another big-city mayor, Chicago's Rahm Emanuel, after his son was mugged outside what should be the safest place in the Windy City. Emanuel's 17-year-old son went outside to make a phone call when he was attacked by two men who stole his cellphone.Young Emanuel was put in a chokehold by one of his assailants and punched in the face by the other. He was not killed, as are many young Chicagoans, largely blacks killed by other blacks, as is the case across an America told to fear the police. When you are in trouble you call a cop, not the race-baiting Al Sharpton.Both mayors, like their counterparts elsewhere, go nowhere without armed security. They know in their hearts that the problem in America's cities is a crime problem and not a race problem, as another former New York mayor, Rudy Giuliani, points out.He noted that one of the cops slain in New York was Asian and the other Hispanic in perhaps the most racially and ethnically diverse police department in the world.Matters were not helped when President Obama fed the animus toward police fed by de Blasio, Sharpton and others when he said: ""Sometimes our institutions and our systems don't work as well as they should. Sometimes you have a police department that has gotten into bad habits over a period of time and hasn't maybe surfaced some hidden biases we all carry around.""We do not know what hidden biases officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu were harboring before they were assassinated in their police car.To the NAACP, such flame-fanning animus towards cops is not the problem. ""While some may suggest a causal link between these killings and the recent protests and activism focused on the serious issue of police violence against unarmed African-Americans, we caution against escalating an already tense national state through rumor and conjecture,"" a statement from the NAACP's legal arm said, itself an escalation by blaming ""police violence"" for the current tensions.The NAACP descended further into absurdity when it said, ""These two killings ... like some other unfortunate instances of gun violence, provide a stark example of the need for sensible gun-control measures.""To the NAACP, the murders of Ramos and Liu had nothing to do with crowds worked up by racial arsonists shouting that they wanted dead cops and they wanted them now. It was because the thug that shot them had access to a firearm.These are not ""protests"" or ""activism."" These are incitements to riot aided and abetted by public officials who should know better. When Rep. Gabby Giffords was shot, Sarah Palin was blamed because she had ""targeted"" certain congressional districts, marking them with a ""crosshair"" symbol.Where are those voices condemning Sharpton, de Blasio, and, yes, even President Obama, for putting crosshairs on the backs of police officers, backs that were turned as Mayor de Blasio entered the hospital where the two cops were taken?This is not a race issue or a gun-control issue. It's a goon-control issue, and a cop-killer issue as well.

"
791,COP,"Reuters is reporting that the U.S. government ""has taken a new, though preliminary, step to encourage commercial development of the moon."" At first glance, this is good news: Commercial development is part of a strong, growing economy.But take a second look: Is government really needed for commercial development of the moon?We've been behind the privatization of space for some time now. The government did a fine job of kicking off space exploration, but the private sector needs to take the lead now because capitalism can do what government does and do it far better.Capitalism is effective because it is driven by the profit motive. The Federal Aviation Administration has said that private space travel will be a $1 billion industry by 2022, and the possibilities have captured the attention of the profit-minded. Those incentives that once drove NASA, however, appear to be waning.The commercialization of space has, in fact, already begun. A private company - SpaceX - has moved cargo to the International Space Station. So has Orbital Sciences Corp.Meanwhile, entrepreneurs are lining up space tourists, who will pay heavenly sums to look back at Earth from a new perspective.The only legitimate function government can play in space or on the moon (and everywhere else beyond this planet) is the same role it has on Earth: to act as an arbitrator when conflicts arise, enforce contracts, secure private property ownership, and protect individual liberty the way it is supposed to on the ground and at sea. Otherwise, it should not intervene in private affairs.Government doesn't even have to play traffic cop to keep rockets from crashing into each other and from taking out airplanes in flight. Let private enterprise take care of that, too. It will do a better job.Of course there's that United Nations treaty the U.S. is a party to that apparently forbids private ownership of land on the moon. But there's not much the U.N. or its member nations can do short of war if the private sector gets there first, establishes occupancy and cooperatively settles land ownership issues similar to the way Western cattlemen did. The moon, after all, is just another frontier.

792,COP,"Foreign Policy: Soon after President Obama announced plans to normalize relations with Cuba, Sen. Marco Rubio called him the worst negotiator since Jimmy Carter. Cuban officials are now proving Rubio right.As soon as Obama made his announcement, it became clear he'd pretty much given up the store and gotten nothing in return.Cuba didn't have to make any concessions on freedom of speech, democratic elections, a market economy. It didn't have to turn over U.S. fugitives, including a convicted cop killer, whom it's been protecting for years.Indeed, as we noted in this space after Obama's announcement, Raul Castro was soon bragging about how he'd struck a deal with Obama ""without a single sacrifice of our principles.""Castro apparently feels no need to do so in the future, either. After the opening round of talks, Cuban diplomat Josefina Vidal told the AP that ""changes in Cuba aren't negotiable.""Now, to add insult to injury, Castro has started issuing his own set of demands.In a speech at the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States summit in Costa Rica on Wednesday, he said there'd be no normalization of relations unless the U.S. ends the trade embargo, closes the naval base at Guantanamo Bay and takes Cuba off the list of state sponsors of terror.Oh, and he also wants the U.S. to stop allowing Cubans to stay in this country just because they manage to set foot on American soil. That's been causing a brain drain from the island, you see.Castro has even told Obama what to do, saying in his speech the president should ""use with resolve his broad executive powers to substantially change the scope of the blockade, even without the Congress' decision.""Why shouldn't Castro be so brazen? Obama has already shown his hand. So Castro knows he can keep upping the bid, assuming — most likely correctly — that Obama will do anything to keep the normalization process from folding.If this were the only time Obama has miserably failed at the bargaining table, it would be bad enough. But it's just the latest in an continuing and ominous pattern — from his dealings with Iran, his prisoner exchange with the Taliban, his phony ""red line"" in Syria, his ""reset"" with Russia, etc.Come to think of it, saying Obama is the worst negotiator since Jimmy Carter is actually an insult to Carter.

"
808,COP,"had a defender of cop-killer Mumia abu-Jamal as an assistant, takes the
"
809,COP,"death penalty off the table for four alleged Virginia cop-killers.The National Guard has not been called up, Al Sharpton has not made an appearance, and neither have 40 FBI agents been dispatched to ensure the convictions of the four gang members who allegedly murdered a Virginia police officer.Nor will there be riots and looting if they are acquitted.When cops are the victims instead of the accused, a different standard of social justice seems to apply.Waynesboro, Va., is not Ferguson, Mo., and 45-year-old reserve Virginia police officer Kevin Quick is not Michael Brown, shot and killed by Ferguson officer Darren Wilson.In February, officer Quick never made it after he texted his girlfriend that he was on his way to see her.According to police, Quick was set upon by three siblings and a fourth man, and was carjacked, kidnapped and taken from bank to bank to withdraw money using his own debit card at gunpoint before being shot to death.His body was found in a wooded area in Goochland County six days later.Siblings Daniel Mathis, Shantai Shelton and Mersadies Shelton have been charged along with a fourth man, Kweli Uhuru, in a federal indictment that lists them as members of a street gang called the ""99 Goon Syndicate,"" an offshoot of the infamous ""Bloods"" gang, and allegedly committed the murder to climb in the gang ranks.The alleged killers now await trial, which is currently set for May 4, 2015.Federal prosecutors say that U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder has taken the death penalty off the table in this case and that the four co-defendants will instead face the possibility of life without parole.No official reason has been given in this case of premeditated murder. But we suspect the reasons include Holder's opposition to the death penalty and his sharing of the belief that the death penalty in particular and the justice system in general are skewed against minority defendants such as these four accused.Fox News reports that of the 1,236 death penalty cases brought before Holder's DOJ through 2013, only 27 have been approved for the death penalty.After the botched execution of convicted killer Clayton Lockett in April, who reportedly writhed in pain before dying of a heart attack after his lethal injection, President Obama tasked Holder with a national review of the death penalty.""Racial bias. Uneven application of the death penalty. Situations in which there were individuals on death row who later on were discovered to be innocent ... All of these do raise significant questions about how the death penalty is being applied,"" Obama said in calling for the review. ""I think as a society, we have to ask ourselves some difficult and profound questions.""Yes, we do.Holder, who once called the United States a ""nation of cowards"" regarding discussions of race, is the AG who failed to prosecute one of the clearest cases of voter intimidation in American history in Philadelphia by black militants, members of the New Black Panther Party.If they had been white supremacists in, say, Alabama, we suspect that he would not have been so reluctant.Holder expressed no opposition to Debo Adegbile, Obama's nominee to be assistant attorney general for the civil rights division at the Department of Justice.Adegbile fought to free from prison and save from the death penalty one Mumia abu-Jamal, the cold-blooded killer of Philadelphia cop Daniel Faulkner.If anyone deserves the death penalty, cop-killers do, and if there is any uneven application of the death penalty, it is the one meted out to the victims of these thugs.Their deaths cannot be taken off the table, and Holder's Justice Department appears to be anything but colorblind.

812,COP,"Leadership: By hurling fresh insults at cops after a police funeral, New York Mayor Bill de Blasio seems bent on escalating the war with the NYPD. If he's not willing to mend fences with police, he should step down.Earlier this week, de Blasio outrageously accused officers of being ""disrespectful to the families"" of a fallen brother in blue when they turned their backs as he spoke at the service. ""They were disrespectful to the families who had lost their loved ones,"" de Blasio illogically claimed on Monday. ""I can't understand why anyone would do such a thing in the context like that.""In fact, they honored the slain officer, Wenjian Liu, by standing some four hours in the rain outside. Clearly it was de Blasio they were disrespecting.Their back-turning protest mirrored action officers also took more than a week earlier at the funeral for NYPD Officer Rafael Ramos, who was gunned down with Liu while sitting in a squad car last month. Their killer was a black man inspired by anti-cop rhetoric, which includes recent remarks from the mayor.Instead of showing mature leadership, de Blasio has chosen to play political games, adding another lie on top of the one he publicly mouthed about New York cops being so racist he feared for his biracial son's life.The cops are turning their backs on de Blasio because he turned his back on them. Like no other mayor before him, he has thoroughly lost the respect of the police and is at risk of losing control of the Big Apple. More than 65,300 people, including many NYPD cops, already have signed a petition calling for de Blasio to resign.This liberal Democratic mayor has so poisoned the well with police — the most important relationship he has in a crowded city of 9 million — that he may not be able to run the city effectively. Morale is falling among rank-and-file police, owing to his demoralizing remarks and constant calls for police reforms, and cops have curtailed patrols in dangerous parts of New York.This is a crisis of his own making. By praising anti-cop protesters who shouted ""dead cops,"" and by reappointing a criminal court judge who recently released without bail an 18-year-old black man accused of making threats against police officers, de Blasio has created a dangerous atmosphere for policing. Two more NYPD cops were gunned down Monday while responding to a robbery.As a result, arrests and summonses are down over 90% in the city as police go on strike against minor street crimes that could expose them to more deadly ambushes.Still, de Blasio's pal Al Sharpton is planning new anti-cop protests, pouring more fuel on the fire. Until the mayor heels his race-baiting attack dog Sharpton and apologizes to police, the Blue Flu will continue and the city could descend into chaos.Issuing a public apology to police would go a long way toward buying good will with his force and cooling rising temperatures. Short of apologizing, de Blasio should step down.

813,COP,"President Obama is leaning on Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto to push Cuba to improve its democracy and human rights record. Seems that with Obama's normalization of ties with Cuba, being leader of the free world has now become just another job Americans won't do.See, in the past, the U.S. was always the nation on the outside, the one that held up the torch of democracy and freedom while Latin America went on as if nothing had ever happened to Cuba's democracy in 1959.Incredibly enough, that's despite the Cuban regime's efforts to subvert those democracies over the years.In the 1960s, Cuban agents invaded and attempted to take over both Venezuela and Colombia, in the latter case starting and financing in 1964 a war — which has yet to end — with the two Marxist narcoterrorist groups, FARC and ELN.In the 1970s, Cuba tried to subvert most of South America through bankrolling local urban terrorists and guerrillas, triggering the terrible Dirty War across the continent. Chile in particular was a target that Fidel Castro attempted to take over completely in 1970. After that, he invaded Africa and then Nicaragua and El Salvador, the damage from which has yet to heal. For his final act, he finally took control of Venezuela in 1998.Yet all these nations have relations with Cuba as if nothing ever happened, while Mexico historically has had a gentlemen's agreement with Castro to provide safe haven to Cuban agents for their operations in the hemisphere in exchange for not fomenting unrest there.That's where we are, and now President Obama has asked the highly co-opted Mexico to act as its point man on human rights for Cuba now that the U.S. is normalizing ties with the island.It's the oddest thing, given that the whole point of normalization was that the U.S. would supposedly be able to talk to Cuba about its barbaric tyranny — its dungeons, its dissident beatings, its arbitrary arrests, its all-pervasive police state.Turns out it's not about that at all. It's about being the good cop, extending travel and remittance cash and trade credits to Castro's Cuba while outsourcing the role of bad cop, the beacon of democracy, to Mexico.It's pathetic.

"
829,COP,"War On Cops: As two NYPD officers were laid to rest, deadly attacks against police have exploded across the country, the outcome of leftist anti-police protests. The left can't wash its hands of this with phony tears at funerals.The murdered New York officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu were barely in their graves after being eulogized by Vice President Joe Biden and New York Mayor Bill de Blasio when new attacks — from targeted shootings to credible Internet threats — flared up across the land.In Durham, N.C., police were shot at in an unprovoked Christmas night attack, while on Sunday officers were shot at with rifles in Los Angeles, prompting a citywide alert. There was another shooting in the Tampa Bay area of Florida. And 11 would-be shooters in Chicago, Pennsylvania and New York all posted credible Internet threats.In an atmosphere like this, it's pretty obvious that there's a war against the police, and not surprisingly the security of all law-abiding people is already suffering.On Monday, the New York Post reported that police were refraining from enforcing penalties for small crimes now, fearful of any confrontation that might inflame racial tensions.That's exceptionally bad news, given that New York was cured of its ugly ""Shattered"" and ""Fun City"" reality (as Mick Jagger and Bill Buckley respectively put it) only by Mayor Rudy Giuliani's emphasis on enforcing punishment for small crimes so that large ones could not occur — the so-called ""broken windows theory"" of law enforcement.There's little doubt where the blame lies: with the race-baiters and communist organizing groups who have taken their cues from the wink-and-nod encouragement from political leaders at the top.Leaders from President Obama to de Blasio have embraced the radical ""narrative"" that all police are ""Bull Connor""-style predators on black people, along with the de facto message that the police do not have the right to defend themselves in a confrontation.That was clearly evident in these political leaders' stances in favor of mob protests over grand jury rulings, first in Ferguson, Mo., when a thug attacked a cop to a bad end. It was the cop, cleared by a grand jury, who was forced to resign amid protests. Similar incidents occured in New York and Cleveland.It didn't help that Obama used race-baiter Al Sharpton as a go-to man on race, inviting the ""leader"" to the White House 81 times. It also didn't help that he made apologetic remarks to the U.N. about Ferguson, again underlining that police have no right to self-defense.With a message like that, it shouldn't surprise anyone that thugs with rifles and an urge to scream fire in a crowded theatre would act up — and very quickly.It's a disastrous and foolish action, effectively announcing to criminals that the consequences for hunting down cops is nonexistent to small.Personal security is the foremost of human rights, as writer Robert Young Pelton has noted, and there's no disputing that cops protect far more than they harm.It's time for a serious response from political leaders, because the fire this time has already started.

I know from personal experience that there is little anyone can say or do at this moment to ease the pain, that sense of loss, that sense of loneliness.But I do hope you take some solace from the fact that as reported by the press there’s over 25,000 members of the same fraternity and sorority as your husband who stand and will stand with you the rest of your life -- and they will. It’s an uncommon fraternity.Justin, and Jayden, you’ve shown tremendous courage and character in these past few days. You are your father’s sons. And he was so, so very proud of you from everything that I have heard. And just know, as hard as it is to believe, he will be part of your life the entirety of your life.Mom, no child should predecease a parent. My heart aches for you.And, Maritza, I know from experience there are no words that I can offer to ease that profound sense of loneliness and loss you’re feeling right now.But I also know from experience that the time will come -- the time will come when Rafael’s memory will bring a smile to your lips before it brings a tear to your eyes. That’s when you know it’s going to be okay. I know it’s hard to believe it will happen, but I promise you it will happen. And my prayer for you is it will come sooner rather than later.There’s a headstone in Ireland that reads:Death leaves a heartache no one can heal.Love leaves a memory that no one can steal. Just sitting here for a few moments looking at the screens, no one had to know your husband to not know how desperately he cared about his family, how close he was to all of you.I didn’t know your husband and I didn't know his partner, who were keeping watch at Myrtle and Tompkins Avenue on that terrible afternoon, but I do know why they were there. They were there to protect and defend, as they always are.  Sometimes fearful, but always watchful.I knew them. They’re the guy I grew up with in Scranton and Claymont, Delaware, the boy with the most courage and the most compassion; the man with a brave heart and a generous soul; a brother who always looked out for his sister; a father whose words were always encouraging to you boys with a touch that could soothe away the fear; and a son who made his mother proud every time he turned and smiled at her; and a husband with a gentle hand who could soothe away the concerns, who you knew would always be there.A former school safety officer, who became a cop at age 37; an active member of his church, studying to become a chaplain; a father, a husband, a son; a seven-year veteran on the force. A son of a Chinese immigrant, his partner, conversant in several dialects; a newlywed. Both -- confident, committed, passionate and vigilant.Being a cop was not what they did, it was who they were; like every man and woman in uniform here today. It’s who you are. And they like every one of you in uniform inside this church and outside, you all joined for essentially the same reason. There was something about you that made you think you could help, that you should serve, that you had a duty.I have spoken at too many funerals for too many peace officers, too many funerals for brave women and men who kept us safe and watched their families grieve. And I’ve observed one thing that unfortunately, it’s only when a tragedy like this occurs that all their friends, neighbors, and people who didn't even know them become of aware of and reminded of the sacrifices they make every single, solitary day to make our lives better.Today we pay tribute to Officer Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu. We pay tribute to their families. Because every day when a police officer pins on that shield and walks out the door, the officer’s wife, husband, mother, father, brother, sister, children -- they know anything could happen. The fear of that call at 3:00 a.m. in the morning, the relief of hearing the voice of the door opened, says, I’m home.There’s a line from the English poet, John Milton. He said, “They also serve who only stand and wait.” Thousands upon thousands upon thousands of American families stand and wait so their husbands and wives, fathers and sons can serve the rest of us. Police officers and police families are a different breed —- thank God for them. Thank God for them.And your husband, Maritza, and his partner, they were a part of New York’s Finest. And that's not an idle phrase. This is probably the finest police department in the world -- the finest police department in the world. They earn that praise. (Applause.)It’s a sacred trust they took on when they kiss their children’s forehead as they sleep, and head out on a night shift to watch over all of the children of this great city, treating and protecting each of them as if they were their own.When you patrol the streets of New York, you circle the Earth; a six-story walk-up, apartment towers, aromas of a million kitchens continuing thousands of traditions; streets full of silence, streets bursting with hundreds languages -— whispering. Laughing. Shouting.An intimidating city. A city of others. A city of labels and borders and seemingly unbridgeable gaps, a city constantly grappling with issues as old as the nation and as new as the morning headlines.Yet in every neighborhood in this great city, this most alive of all cities, this chaotic miracle stands as a beacon to the world in no small part because of the sacrifices that the New York Police Department makes every single day.So when an assassin’s bullet targeted two officers, it targeted this city and it touched the soul of the entire nation -- a city where the son of a Chinese immigrant shared a patrol with a Hispanic minister in training; a city where a single ride on a subway brings you into contact with more people, more lives than many people in this country will encounter in an entire lifetime; a city that educated a young college student with a mother from Kansas, and a father from Kenya who would one day stand before the nation and declare: This is not a black America or a white America or a Latino America or an Asian America; this is the United States of America. (Applause.)And for those of us who are not New Yorkers, we look at you in awe because this is the united city of New York as well; a city that rose as one to confront two of the greatest disasters of this century -- one from the evils of terrorism on 9/11 and one from the fury of nature in Superstorm Sandy.This is a city of courage and character, having faced and overcome the toughest challenges and I’m absolutely confident as you are that spirit is still alive and well in this city. And I’m absolutely confident it will guide you in the days and weeks ahead.I believe that this great police force, and this incredibly diverse city can and will show the nation how to bridge any divide. You’ve done it before. And you will do it again. Because, to paraphrase the words of William Allen White, you are not afraid of tomorrow, because you’ve seen yesterday and because you love today.To the Ramos family, we were all lucky to have Rafael. He didn’t just have a bible in his locker, he lived it in his heart. He was a cop for all the right reasons.Mom, we owe you for nurturing him. And, Maritza, we owe you for supporting him. And, Justin and Jayden, know that although your father is gone, you have inherited an entire family, the men and women of the New York Police Department will always be there as long as you are alive. They never -- they never -- never forget.There’s a communion hymn in my church that has a stanza that goes like this:May he raise you up on eagle’s wingsAnd bear you on the breath of dawn.And make the sun to shine on you.That’s what your father wished for, for both you boys. That's what your father wished for, for this city. And it will happen.May God bless your family and the family of his partner and may God protect the 84th Precinct and every police officer throughout this great country and keep them safe while they stand on watch for us. God bless you all. (Applause.) ####

886,COP,"War on Cops: The Obama administration isn't just emboldening cop killers with its anti-cop rhetoric. It's also making it easier for them to attack police by taking away cops' power to defend themselves.Attorney General Eric Holder has ordered the retraining of police in several major departments across the country to combat what he calls pervasive racism in law enforcement.The training unreasonably restricts cops' ability to defend themselves during confrontations in high-crime areas, making them more vulnerable to personal attack.Some cops are already fighting back. But it's not enough.Last week's assassination of two NYPD cops demands a strong, nationwide pushback against the Obama regime's police ""reforms,"" which, if fully implemented, threaten to weaken American law enforcement and public safety for decades to come.Earlier this year, more than 120 Seattle police officers filed a lawsuit against Holder, arguing that his retraining program has created ""hesitation and paralysis"" among officers, stripping them of their right to make reasonable, split-second decisions in the line of duty to protect themselves.Street cops there are afraid to act in tense situations for fear of being second-guessed over complicated rules concocted by civil-rights prosecutors in D.C., who, despite having no experience policing urban streets, think they know better when to use force than cops working those streets every day.The suit, now on appeal after a Clinton-appointed judge tossed it, alleges that officers have turned in Tasers in large numbers because of confusion about how and when to use them.They're also reluctant to respond to backup calls out of fear of being disciplined by federal monitors.Holder's new rules force cops to ""engage in mental gymnastics wholly unreasonable in light of the dangerous and fast-evolving circumstances we face every day . ... This creates unnecessary risks to safety.""One rule in the 60-page use-of-force manual actually requires cops to retreat from perps resisting arrest.Instead of physically confronting them, they must now place ""barriers between an uncooperative subject and an officer"" and use ""verbal persuasion"" to coax them into cooperating.Cops are also ordered to speak respectfully to them to preserve their ""dignity.""The rules went into effect in January. Officers already report retreating from suspects ""who threatened the officer with death or serious injury.""Outrageously, the new federally mandated policy puts the interest of criminals over those of both law-abiding citizens and the officers sworn to protect them.The feds have tied the hands of cops in similar ways in Las Vegas; New Orleans; Fayetteville, N.C.; Cleveland; Philadelphia; Spokane, Wash.; and several other cities.It is all designed to protect black suspects from ""discriminatory policing.""But since young black men are responsible for an outsize portion of violent crime, it just puts the lives of both innocent civilians and cops at risk.With these retraining and ""de-biasing"" orders, the Obama regime is playing racial politics with public safety.

899,COP,"Lawlessness: The blood of two cops assassinated by a young black man in New York is also on the hands of everybody who encouraged the black community to hate police — including the president and his attorney general.Over the weekend, Ismaaiyl Brinsley, a 22-year-old thug from Baltimore, ambushed and murdered in cold blood two NYPD cops, shooting them both in the head, execution style, as they sat in their police cruiser.Brinsley said that he was taking revenge for the deaths of Eric Garner and Michael Brown, two black criminals recently killed in altercations with police. On social media, Brinsley posted alongside a photo of a handgun: ""They Take 1 Of Ours ... Let's Take 2 of Theirs.""The killing of officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu follows four months of incendiary propaganda from the White House suggesting that Garner and Brown were innocent victims and that cops were racist and gunning for black men. The hate speech continued even after racially mixed grand juries found no evidence to support such claims in either case.Obama and Eric Holder personally egged on anti-cop protesters in St. Louis and New York with their irresponsible rhetoric. They even huddled with racial arsonist Al Sharpton in the White House to coordinate their agitation campaign, calling for the ""reform of law enforcement.""Obama insisted that law enforcement do not treat black citizens fairly, that they profile young black men in particular. He said that blacks have good reason to distrust police, given the history of discrimination in America.Holder, meanwhile, said that he's been personally harassed by police and has counseled his son to be wary of cops. He announced that he was doubling the number of civil-rights investigations of police departments. Message: the Ferguson PD, NYPD and other police forces are a bunch of racists.Obama now decries the violent backlash against cops: ""I ask people to reject violence and words that harm."" But his statement rings hollow against his own racially divisive words of harm.Just the day before the attack on New York cops, as he was headed off to vacation in Hawaii, Obama glibly claimed that police carry ""hidden biases"" with them as they patrol urban neighborhoods, an invisible prejudice that he claims is left over from ""a legacy of a troubled past of Jim Crow and slavery.""He added that the anti-cop ""Hands Up, Don't Shoot,"" ""I Can't Breathe"" and ""No Justice, No Peace; No Racist Police"" protests across the nation have been ""healthy.""Over and over, he and his attorney general have given the perception to the black community that cops are the enemy. By scurrilously rushing to the race conclusion in Ferguson and Staten Island, they inflamed the community and gave would-be thugs like Brinsley an excuse to act out against cops. Why not? The president says so, the attorney general says so.What's truly despicable is that Obama and Holder know from the data that the conflict between blacks and cops has little to do with race and almost everything to do with crime.They know that crime is out of control in the black community. They know that, as the Justice Department clearly reports, blacks commit a startling 53% of the nation's murders and that 91% of blacks who are murdered are murdered not by whites but by other blacks.But instead of solving the growing problem of black crime, they put the blame on police, who like Ramos and Liu are often dispatched to the black community to protect law-abiding blacks from thugs. And they invite Sharpton and other high priests of hate to the White House to gin up grievances against white cops.Obama was faced with flash points in Ferguson and Staten Island, and earlier in Sanford, Fla., and instead of taking the responsible route and letting the facts play out in these cases, he and his attorney general poured gasoline on them by claiming that law enforcement officers had it in for blacks.They don't, but Obama and Holder clearly have it in for law enforcement. And now they've put targets on officers' backs.

908,COP,"Black Crime: If President Obama had a son, he might look like 15-year-old Demario Bailey, one of three killed and 30 wounded in a typical Chicago weekend by thugs who wanted his Bulls jacket.As Bailey was being murdered while walking with his twin brother to a school basketball game, protestors of police brutality marched down Chicago's ritzy Michigan Avenue. They told high-end shoppers there that ""black lives matter,"" held up their hands and said ""don't shoot,"" and wore shirts that proclaimed ""I can't breathe."" The protest was part of a series of demonstrations also being held in Washington, New York, Boston and California.""We're going to keep the light on Mike Brown .. . on all the victims. The only way you make roaches run is to keep the lights on,"" said Al Sharpton, who will not be attending Demario's funeral due to scheduling conflicts, and whose National Action Network organized the Washington rally.We should instead keep the light on Demario and the other young African-Americans whose lives are snuffed out every day, many for refusing to join gangs. They are young men accused of ""acting white"" because they don't drop out of school to hang on street corners, who do their homework at night, who speak in intelligible sentences and who walk with their siblings to school basketball games.These black victims do not commit strong-armed robberies of convenience stores or assault police officers and struggle for their guns, as Brown allegedly did in Ferguson, Mo. If the outcome there had been different, we might not even know Brown's name and Darren Wilson would have been just one more dead police officer in America.We should shine a light on the truth that, according to recent FBI statistics and data from the Center on Juvenile and Criminal Justice at the Centers for Disease Control, young black males are likely to be killed by other black males, and white officers are more likely the victims than the villains in gun violence involving African-Americans.The CDC statistics show that police killings of blacks have declined 70% over the past 50 years.In 2012, 123 blacks were killed by officers with guns vs. 326 whites. Fact is, 60% of black victims of homicide are killed by other blacks, as was the case with Demario. In 2013, blacks committed 5,375 murders while whites committed 4,396.According to the FBI, which just released its supplemental homicide data for 2012, ""white"" homicide victims, a category that includes Hispanics, are twice as likely to be killed by black assailants than black homicide victims are to be killed by ""white"" assailants. There were 431 black killers of whites vs. 193 ""white"" killers of blacks.These statistics are made more remarkable by the fact that blacks represent only 13% of the population. Blacks are also disproportionately represented among cop killers. In 2013, blacks made up 42% of all cop-killers whose race was known.Last year, Janay McFarlane, 18, was killed just hours after her younger sister was among a group of teens who were onstage as President Obama gave a speech in Chicago on gun violence. Destini McFarlane, 14, sat just feet away as the president spoke of a similar murder of 15-year-old Hadiya Pendleton.There will be more black victims such as these, and more Demario Baileys, until self-appointed and self-righteous leaders, Sharpton included, are drowned out by those who recognize that the danger to black lives is not white cops but black thugs.

909,COP,"Rights: No longer fearing electoral revenge from the National Rifle Association, an outgoing Democratic Senate pushed to confirm an anti-Second Amendment radical, who thinks guns are a health issue, as the nation's top doc.A Democratic Senate that earlier balked at the nomination of Dr. Vivek Murthy to be surgeon general of the U.S. no longer feared the possible electoral consequences of approving him in the wake of November's Republican tsunami.That, along with the GOP's obsession to not be blamed for a government shutdown, gave us a bad budget deal and the Democrats a chance to confirm Murthy.A brief rebellion over immigration led by Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, interrupted the smooth passage of what has been called Cromnibus and led to a weekend session that arguably gave outgoing Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid an opportunity to advance several of President Obama's nominees toward confirmation, including the once-stalled nomination of Murthy.On Saturday, after the Senate voted 52-40 to bring Murthy's nomination to the floor for a vote, Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., gleefully tweeted, ""Was worried Dr. Vivek Murthy might not get confirmed but thanks to @Ted Cruz, looks like he will. #TopDocNow #SurgeonGeneral."" With Murthy confirmed to a post that had been vacant since July 2013, the White House push for gun control will proceed with renewed vigor.The NRA's Chris Cox called Murthy a ""prescription for disaster for America's gun owners,"" in a letter to Reid and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell in February. Spooked red-state Democrats stalled Vivek's nomination. With the election over and control of the Senate lost anyway, Democrats seized the opportunity to leave America a going-away present.Since Reid detonated the nuclear option and changed the filibuster rule for nominees from needing 60 votes to just 51 votes, only one Obama nominee has been defeated. That was the nomination of Debo Adegbile to head the Justice Department's civil rights division. Adegbile lost, largely due to his involvement in the case of cop killer Mumia Abu-Jamal, who was convicted in the murder of Philadelphia police officer Danny Faulkner.Murthy is indeed a prescription for disaster for American gun rights. He has long set his sights on gutting the Second Amendment's guarantee of the right to keep and bear arms, a right the Supreme Court has said is not only an individual right, but also a national one.Gun control zealots had argued that the Second Amendment guaranteed only a ""well-regulated militia"" had that right, meaning the National Guard, and that even if it were an individual right, it applied only to the federal enclave of the District of Columbia.Murthy's approach to attacking the Second Amendment has been to say private ownership of firearms is a public health issue. The 37-year-old Murthy is president and co-founder of the anti-gun group Doctors for America, which advocates ObamaCare and gun control laws. His group, which has been dubbed Docs vs. Glocks, has pushed Congress to ban ""assault"" weapons and ""high capacity"" magazines.Doctors for America has promoted the invasion of privacy by doctors by advocating they ask patients if they have guns at home, including asking children if their parents own guns. He would have doctors counsel their patients against exercising their Second Amendment rights. One wonders how private that information would remain if entered into the medical records the government would be privy to under ObamaCare.Millions of law-abiding Americans believe that a gun in their hand is better than a cop on the phone and that their constitutionally guaranteed right to keep and bear arms is inoculation against being another unarmed victim of an armed predator.Murthy's answer to crime is don't defend yourself and your family, but take two bullets and call him in the morning.It's a bad prescription for all of us.

Or, he says, maybe it's ""Ride Along,"" an action comedy in which Kevin Hart goes on a ride with undercover cop Ice Cube to prove himself worthy of his sister.""What they have revealed,"" writes Fox News commentator Juan Williams in an essay worth reading in full, ""is how demeaning and patronizing their liberal minds can be even when the man is the leader of the nation."" Williams describes the emails as ""a dazzling display of white liberal hypocrisy.""Coming from a prominent moderate-to-liberal black, this is a devastating attack.Williams goes on to note that ""I know from personal experience at National Public Radio that white liberals can be very intolerant if they suspect they are dealing with a black person who is not afraid (to) depart from liberal orthodoxy. In my case I was fired and afterward described as a bigot in need of psychiatric care.""There is intolerance, hatred and bigotry to be found on all sides of the ideological spectrum. Too often, though, the left acts as though — and gets away with claiming — these ills reside only among conservatives.

918,COP,"Justice: Led by the Senate chaplain, of all people, congressional staffers fan the flames of racial division by doing something that Michael Brown of Ferguson, Missouri, never did before he assaulted officer Darren Wilson.It mattered not to the congressional aides who walked off their jobs Thursday to protest the deaths of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., and Eric Garner in New York that a police officer dies while on duty every 58 hours — or that a grand jury found that officer Darren Wilson had reason to fear becoming one of them.There they were, raising their hands in a gesture that black witnesses testifying before a grand jury said Michael Brown never made as he charged Wilson ""like a football player"" and after he punched Wilson and struggled for the cop's firearm.There was Senate chaplain Barry Black, standing in front of 210 staffers and a few congressmen, saying, ""Forgive us when we have failed to lift our voices for those who can't speak or breathe for themselves.""That was a thinly veiled reference to what Garner reportedly said as he struggled with police officers led by a black female sergeant, all unaware of his medical issues, in New York.The fact is, if neither Garner nor Brown had resisted arrest, both would be alive today.No longer able to speak or breathe for themselves are the 1,501 police officers that the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund reports have died in the line of duty in the past 10 years, an average of one every 58 hours. Over that decade, on average, have been 58,261 assaults against police officers every year, resulting in 15,658 injuries annually caused by criminal assailants who, like Brown, never put their hands up.One of those cops was Daryl Pierson, 32, of Rochester, N.Y., who was killed by Thomas Johnson III, wanted for a parole violation, as he fled from one of those routine traffic stops the likes of Al Sharpton cite as racial profiling and ""driving while black.""President Obama once famously said that if he had a son he would look like Trayvon Martin, the Florida teen shot and killed by neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman. It is not known if he is willing to make the same claim about Johnson.""These congressional staffers put in incredibly long hours, nights and weekends, to pass legislation to help people lead better lives, so I fully support them,"" said Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., who said the protest was to show how ""incredibly frustrated"" they are by the Brown and Garner deaths and the ""mistrust"" these and other protesters have in the criminal justice system.Would that be the same criminal justice system that put Thomas Johnson III back on the streets?Cops of all colors also put in incredibly long hours, nights and weekends protecting those people striving to lead better lives. Instead of thanks, they get lectures on profiling and racial sensitivity from grandstanding politicians and Attorney General Eric Holder.Waynesboro, Va., is not Ferguson, Mo., and 45-year-old reserve police officer Kevin Quick is not Michael Brown.According to police, Quick was set upon by three siblings and a fourth man, and was carjacked, kidnapped and taken from bank to bank to withdraw money using his own debit card at gunpoint before being shot to death.Holder has taken the death penalty off the table in this case, and the four defendants will instead face the possibility of life without parole, lest they unfairly face the ultimate penalty from a mistrusted criminal justice system. Kevin Quick's death penalty cannot be revoked, a risk every cop faces every day.When a cop dies, there are no riots or protests. Just another cop funeral.

934,COP,"To succeed as the boss, protect and serve your people. So says Chris Van Gorder, CEO of Scripps Health and author of ""The Front-Line Leader."" The former cop tells IBD that just as police work is about protecting the community, making it a better place, developing relationships and doing the right thing, ""businesses that follow these same principles lay the groundwork for lasting success."" Tips:• Interact. Be accessible and communicate, Van Gorder said: ""Teach directly and often with your employees — answer your emails, get out of your office, and make opportunities to talk with them. I go to nearly every new employee orientation so that I can meet as many of them as possible.""• Show concern. Van Gorder grasps that his employees are individuals first. ""They have to take care of (their needs) before they can take care of the organization,"" he said. Scripps puts programs in place to help employees facing personal struggles. Plus, ""we've adopted a no-layoffs philosophy, and that's freed our employees up to help us find the smartest ways to cut costs and improve quality, instead of being distracted by the concern of their own jobs being cut.""• Spin a yarn. Leaders are teachers, and lessons taught through stories resonate, Van Gorder says.A favorite of his: ""My encounter with my CEO when I was a security guard at a hospital. We were the only two in the basement hall in the middle of the night, I was excited to meet him, and yet he passed by without even looking at me.""That hurt and has stayed with me for decades. But I share it because it illustrates my point of the importance of engaging with and getting to know your people.""• Hold employees accountable. Van Gorder sees executive responsibilities like this: ""Giving a pass on poor performance means the organization suffers."" He added, ""Great leaders also embrace accountability for themselves.""Bob Lutz, former vice chairman of General Motors (GM) and the author of ""Icons and Idiots: Straight Talk On Leadership,"" noted that while top leaders love their people, the nature of the beast is that ""shareholders come first."" Hence, even the kindest leader, in order to protect the shareholders and the bulk of the organization, ""needs to criticize, and sometimes punish, not for pleasure, but because there needs to be accountability.""• Be consistent. ""Nothing is harder for people to follow than a leader whose priorities constantly shift,"" Lutz said. While adjustments are necessary in business, the core priorities — what the leader wants the organization to stand for — cannot change. Same goes for the boss' demeanor. ""A good leader should be predictable in reactions, demonstrating an expected set of behaviors under similar circumstances.""• Strive. Lutz's definition of a business leader is ""a person who can create change and bring about a new state that, in his or her conviction, is superior.""He added that a top dog who gets there ""usually possesses the ability, by the spoken or written word, to convince others of the soundness of his reasoning, thus enlisting their service in pursuit of the goal.""• Be true. ""A successful leader has a deep commitment to absolute honesty and integrity,"" Lutz said. ""Absent that, nothing else matters.""• Be bold. Assess risk, then act. That takes courage, which Lutz calls a cornerstone of good leadership. Effective bosses ""recognize the universal truth of 'no risk, no reward,'"" he wrote.• Check yourself. Truly successful, capable bosses, Lutz has found, ""are those with a strong focus and powerful will but still able to listen to the inner voice asking, 'Am I sure I'm right?'""

935,COP,"Often, it's not how well you do, it's how well you do relative to expectations. The same applies to earnings reports. A company that crushes earnings estimates often enjoys a big stock gain, as a surprise Wall Street sets a higher valuation. It also suggests the company has a stronger growth trajectory that bodes well for long-term share price gains.IBD's Screen of the Day is Estimate Beaters. These are highly rated companies with the biggest earnings per share outperformance in the latest quarter. Today's screen includes three security-related companies.CyberArk Software (CYBR) is one of several cybersecurity firms benefitting from companies' recognition that online security is a priority, not a luxury. That follows high-profile breaches from Target (TGT), Home Depot (HD) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM).The Newton, Mass.-based company claims to be able to deal with threats proactively, before they become major threats.CyberArk beat EPS estimates by 1,900% in its first earnings report as a public company. CyberArk had a successful IPO in late September.The stock rose 27% on Nov. 13 on the powerful 73% earnings gain and upbeat outlook. Shares continued to rise to a peak of 47.01 on Nov. 24. But CyberArk got two valuation-based downgrades on Nov. 25, sending shares down more than 9% that day. The stock has continued to fall, losing 7.2% on the stock market Monday as it starts to fill in the gap from the post-earnings share spike.Vasco Data Security (VDSI) makes software and hardware that boost protect mobile applications, verify transactions, manage identities and secure cloud-based data. Like CyberArk and other cybersecurity stocks such as Palo Alto Networks (PANW), Vasco Data is benefiting from increased spending on web security to defend against ever-more sophisticated hacks.Vasco Data crushed Wall Street forecasts by 180% in the latest quarter, with EPS growth of 167%. The stock, like the Nasdaq composite, hit a record high on Nov. 28. Shares drifted sideways until Monday, when they fell 6.3%.Taser International (TASR) offers security for the real world, most notably with its non-lethal stun guns. It's enjoyed increasing orders to police departments. Taser topped EPS estimates by 56% in the last quarter, with actual earnings growth of 40%.Now Taser sees a chance to expand its business with wearable cameras for law enforcement, in an effort to get a clear picture of police-suspect incidents, especially in officer-involved fatalities. Recent unrest of two such fatalities, along with other claims of excessive force, have helped make cop cameras a higher priority. President Obama last week called for funding to help local police departments buy wearable cameras. That's sent shares of Taser, Digital Ally (DGLY) and video processing chipmaker Ambarella (AMBA) sharply higher in recent weeks.Taser shares hit a fresh high on Friday, but fell 6% Monday on an analyst downgrade, seeing little ""upside"" given the sharp run-up.

939,COP,"Racial Politics: The boy who cried wolf has more credibility than this president and his attorney general. They cried ""Racism!"" in Sanford, Ferguson and now Staten Island, and have been proved wrong in each case.Within minutes of jurors clearing a white NYPD cop in the death of African-American suspect Eric Garner, President Obama phoned Eric Holder, who, in turn, launched a federal investigation into perceived civil-rights violations. The probe follows those already underway in Ferguson, Mo., and Sanford, Fla.Never mind that a predominantly minority grand jury, sifting through all the evidence, found that the force used to subdue the 6-foot-3-inch, 350-pound Garner was reasonable. Or that Garner was caught on video repeatedly resisting arrest after breaking the law, though the career criminal knew the drill following 31 previous arrests. Or that cops showed no racial animus. Or that a black sergeant supervised them.Such exonerating facts have zero effect on Obama, who seems bent on seeding distrust in the U.S. justice system as part of a radical racial agenda.Hoover Institution scholar Thomas Sowell said the president ""wants to spread paranoia"" in the black community, adding, ""What amazes me is how long it has taken so many people to see through this man.""Obama asserted the Garner case ""speaks to the larger issues that we've been talking about now for the last week, the last month, the last year — and, sadly, for decades — and that is the concern on the part of too many minority communities that law enforcement is not dealing with them in a fair way.""Implying America remains institutionally biased against blacks is a serious charge. And it's a scurrilous one. Study after study has found no bias in the arrest, prosecution or sentencing of African-Americans.Tearing down respect for the justice system is bad enough. But it's hardly the only institution Obama has accused of structural bias. He and his race-baiting attorney general have also framed banking, education and housing, among others, as equally racist.Consider everyone they've accused of bias in the past six years: mortgage lenders, loan service companies, auto lenders, small business lenders, payday lenders, student loan companies, home insurers, investment bankers, credit card companies, branch bankers charging overdraft fees, credit reporting agencies, medical debt collectors, supermarket chains without enough stores in blighted areas, mayors and local zoning boards limiting subsidized housing, the 48 states barring felons from voting and employers using criminal and credit background checks to screen job applicants.They've even accused school principals, teachers, resource officers and curriculum directors of discriminating against black students.In this massive calumny, they've failed to cite a single example of intentional discrimination. Or ID a single victim by name. In every complaint, they've leveled ambiguous charges of ""implicit"" bias based on ""disparate impact,"" a discredited theory based on raw stats which fail to control for legitimate factors explaining racial disparities. That's because they have no proof, just like in Sanford, Ferguson and Staten Island, N.Y.Yet hundreds of billions of dollars are being redistributed based on these false claims of discrimination.Worse, policies governing everything from bank lending and school discipline to hiring and credit-risk analysis are being revamped to produce the desired racial outcomes — that is, quotas — demanded by this president.Now, with the administration investigating more than 20 police departments across the country for ""biased policing,"" the same will be done for arrest, stop and search policies in communities of color.
"
940,COP,"President Obama and his race-baiting henchmen Eric Holder and Al Sharpton are now 0-2. Just when they thought they had a flash point for a race war in Ferguson, Mo., after the one manufactured in Sanford, Fla., fizzled, the forensic evidence snuffs it out.They've been caught, once again, crying wolf about discrimination in another white-on-black shooting. You'd think they'd stop demagoguing, but they're only doubling down.""Communities of color aren't just making these problems up,"" Obama insisted, blaming their trouble with law enforcement on ""the legacy of racial discrimination"" and even claiming their rioting is ""an understandable reaction.""But multiracial jurors don't buy it and neither does a public growing weary of a black president making excuses for black criminality.African-Americans still represent less than 13% of the population but now commit an astounding 53% of the nation's murders. In urban centers like St. Louis, as well as Chicago and New York, their share of homicides is even higher, based on Holder's own data.Still, Obama uses Michael Brown as a poster boy for ""much-needed criminal justice reform,"" including diversifying local police forces, training cops in ethnic sensitivity and banning criminal profiling. He's planning prejudice powwows, with federal funding tied to compliance with reforms.""I have instructed Attorney General Holder not just to investigate what happened in Ferguson,"" he announced last week in Chicago, ""but also identify specific steps we can take ... to make sure that law enforcement is fair and is being applied equally,"" as if it isn't already.This is the same fair-minded attorney general who prejudged the Brown shooting as a racist execution, even likening it to the 1955 murder of Emmett Till. ""Reform"" also includes Holder's overseeing the early prison release of some 50,000 crack felons next year.Blaming black crime on racism does nothing to solve the problem. It only keeps the furnaces of hate burning in the hood and encourages young black men to use race as a pretext to resort to lives of crime. And tragically, it leads more to commit suicide by gang or cop.To portray Brown as a civil-rights martyr is the height of dishonesty. The record now shows he was a wannabe gangsta, victim only of the welfare plantation that left him fatherless and living in subsidized housing where he idled away in a pot-smoking haze.His partner in crime, Dorian Johnson, shocked grand jurors by casually testifying he smokes dope first thing in the morning. The 22-year-old baby daddy doesn't get up and get dressed for work. No, he gets up and starts rolling blunt.""I smoke marijuana in my mornings when I start my day off,"" the jobless Johnson boasted, adding he and Brown were on a quest to score some ""rillos,"" or cigarillos.Like too many young black men, he and Brown would cut open the slim cigars, empty out the tobacco and replace it with weed, turning them into oversized joints.This ambition-robbing daily habit led to the Ferguson tragedy. Smoking blunt was all they cared about — get up, get ""rillos,"" get back, roll blunt and get high another wasted day — even if it meant robbing a convenience store.And a cop out doing his job got in the way of that pathetic goal.There's no ""racial divide,"" as the race baiters claim. But there is a cultural divide, and it only widens with each round of apologia from black leaders who stand guilty of black-on-black political crimes. Brown was immersed in that culture, and it cost him his life.Brown wasn't stopped because he ""was a big, black, scary man,"" as the racial arsonists like to say; he was stopped because he was a big bully. And he was shot because he was an attempted cop killer.Maybe Brown didn't deserve to die, but given his threatening actions, he was certainly asking to. Both a police sergeant and FBI agent testified that Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson told them contemporaneously that Brown reached into his waistband just before he charged him, a motion that made Wilson think Brown might be pulling out a weapon. Witnesses say Brown ignored repeated orders to stop.White cop or black cop, the result would have been the same: justifiable homicide.One of the Brown family lawyers, in excusing Michael's strong-arm robbery, said it's not like he gave the store clerk ""a beat down."" The culture of violence in the black community is so pervasive that black lawyers reason like thugs.Johnson, who's still lying about the shooting, nonetheless confirmed to jurors that he and his pal Brown had an attitude that fateful morning, daring cops to bust them as they jaywalked with their stolen loot. Even now, he doesn't see anything wrong with such behavior. Instead of shunning this perjurious punk, the black community has embraced him.Obama is wrong: Racial discrimination isn't the issue behind Ferguson, not even remotely. It's black criminality and its enablement.Rather than feeding into street paranoia about bigoted cops, a responsible leader would educate the black community in the same basic rules of conduct every white person must follow when interacting with police. Sperry, formerly IBD Washington bureau chief, is author of ""The Great American Bank Robbery,"" which exposes the racial politics behind the housing crisis.
"
941,COP,"Crime: The Ferguson grand jury not only spared an innocent cop from the mob, but also identified those in the mob who tried to frame him for murder. Those who bore false witness in the case must be held accountable.The most shocking evidence to emerge from the grand jury proceedings was the large number of black witnesses who, according to the prosecutor, acknowledged ""making up"" all or parts of their testimony.Some adjusted their stories to ""fit the facts"" after being confronted with forensic evidence or inconsistencies with other testimony.Some completely recanted, admitting they didn't actually witness Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson shooting robber Michael Brown and just repeated the talk on the street, which clearly was biased against white cops.But others stuck to their bogus stories under oath.Chief among them was Brown's accomplice Dorian Johnson, who told jurors Wilson grabbed the 6-foot, 4-inch 290-pound Brown with one hand — while still seated in his police car — and shot him at point-blank range.He claimed he then shot him again in the back as he ran away from his car, and then again and again as he surrendered with his hands up. ""He could be in jail right now,"" Johnson said of Wilson.But forensic and ballistic evidence back Wilson's account that Brown grabbed his gun, forcing him to fire it into Brown's thumb.""Are you absolutely certain that you did not see Big Mike's hands inside the officer's car in a struggle with the officer?"" an incredulous juror asked.""I never saw at no point in time Big Mike's hand touch the gun or anything like that, because of the gun was already out drawn,"" Johnson insisted, adding that he never saw his buddy strike the cop. He even claimed Wilson aimed his gun at both of them.Johnson went on to testify that Wilson shot Brown ""from behind as he was running away,"" even though forensics refutes that.Johnson, 22, also insisted Brown never turned and charged at the officer. ""I don't think you are lying,"" said another juror, trying to be polite. ""I think you don't have as much of a good vision as you say.""But clearly Johnson was lying, something he has a habit of doing — especially to police, having been previously arrested for theft and making false statements.Yet Johnson managed, with the help of the media, to spread his lies, whipping the black community into a looting and rioting frenzy.At least six African-American witnesses, however, told jurors the truth about what happened, and they should be commended. Unfortunately, they were too scared to come forward publicly.One unidentified witness swore that Brown had ""his arms out with attitude,"" while ""the cop just stood there."" The witness added, ""Dang if that kid didn't start running right at the cop like a football player. Head down.""The witness told of hearing ""3 bangs,"" but ""the big kid wouldn't stop."" Other credible eyewitnesses who lived in the area testified Brown, in fact, never had his hands up.Outrageously, the Justice Department granted immunity from perjury to Johnson and a black woman who told investigators she witnessed Wilson execute Brown in cold blood even though she wasn't even at the scene.Another said he saw Wilson pump four or five shots into Brown as he lay bleeding on the ground, only to revise the tally down to one shot, though no forensic evidence supported that claim.All these false witnesses should be prosecuted. They tried to frame a white cop, and in doing so, sparked looting, shootings and untold damage to not only the local economy but also to national race relations.

945,COP,"War On Terror: As violence in Afghanistan intensifies, including a suicide bombing at a volleyball tournament that killed 50, the president has wisely, if quietly, extended the U.S. combat role there through 2015.President Obama had announced the withdrawal of American combat troops by the end of 2014.But seeing the error of his ways in Iraq, the New York Times reports, Obama will now allow troops to keep fighting the Taliban and al-Qaida threatening American soldiers and the Afghan government.The Times, quoting unnamed administration officials, said that the routing of Iraqi troops by IS fighters across Iraq convinced Obama to delay pulling U.S. troops out of Afghanistan.Well, knock us over with a feather.For the past year, we've been arguing that the commander in chief was doubling down on his Iraq mistakes by announcing a precipitous withdrawal of combat troops in Afghanistan.We noted that the withdrawal seemed to violate Obama's own policy, as he explained it back in 2009, that Afghanistan was a ""war of necessity,"" not a ""war of choice"" — implying that the U.S. had a moral obligation to finish it successfully.We warned of an inevitable Iraqification of Afghanistan, whereby the enemy we spent so much blood and treasure defeating would simply retake lost territory and threaten the freely elected government that we helped put in place.Afghanistan has tipped into a renewed cycle of violence since Obama last month pulled combat troops out of the Taliban's main stronghold and closed a key U.S. Marine camp there.Since Oct. 26, Taliban leaders have unleashed a torrent of terrorist attacks on the Afghan capital and key provinces in a bid to demoralize the people and destabilize the government.In the latest attack, 57 people were killed and some 60 others wounded when a suicide blast ripped through crowds at a volleyball game in eastern Afghanistan attended by top government officials.It was the deadliest attack in the country since 2011 and rattled the Afghan government led by newly elected President Ashraf Ghani.Earlier this month, a Taliban suicide bomber slipped by several security checkpoints and entered the office of Kabul's top cop at the city's police headquarters — one of the capital's most guarded compounds.The terrorist killed the police chief's chief of staff and injured several others. Within an hour, a second Taliban bomber attacked a bus full of soldiers.The next day, three more bombs detonated across Afghanistan, killing at least 10 Afghan police officers.A Taliban spokesman claimed credit for the string of bombings targeting the Afghan security forces that are being left to defend the newly elected government.The American-trained army has suffered severe losses — including more than 4,630 casualties in the past year alone — and is in no shape to take on the Taliban alone. The Taliban has increased the size and tempo of its attacks in anticipation of a U.S. withdrawal.Without the combat troops that Obama had planned to pull out, Afghanistan's security situation could go south even more rapidly than it has in Iraq.All that's standing between the fledgling Ghani administration and the Taliban and al-Qaida terrorists is the weak Afghan security force.In addition to reinforcing Afghan forces with U.S. troops, Obama should also support them with fighter planes, attack helicopters and drones in joint combat missions designed to push the Taliban and al-Qaida back on their heels.Obama's about-face is a badly needed adjustment to the worsening security situation on the ground in Afghanistan.Keeping U.S. boots on the ground there can buy some time for Ghani, who promises to be a more reliable partner than his predecessor, to help stabilize the country both politically and militarily.

946,COP,"Local Leadership: The president wasn't the only disappointment on the night rioters mauled Ferguson. State and local officials also fell short, calling to mind Eric Hoffer's observations about the fragility of institutions.As midnight rioters started to trash, burn and loot mostly black-owned shops, National Guardsmen sent by the governor and the supposedly oppressive local police they were rioting against were on the scene. But rather than use force, the police just stood by, with one officer pleading pathetically from a loudspeaker: ""You need to stop destroying the city of Ferguson."" No surprise, he was ignored.Nor did they heed Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon. When outside agitators showed up in Ferguson in August, his first impulse was to appease — first by replacing local police leadership with a state agency, then putting an African-American in charge, and finally forming a commission on race relations. Predators were only emboldened.The media, meanwhile, decided to convict first and report facts later, twisting the story of a white cop shooting a black attacker to fit a Bull Connor-style ""narrative"" of white cops out to kill black youths.Every event in the lead-up to Monday's riots exhibited weakness. Cowed of being called ""racist,"" local leaders betrayed the rule of law and public peace they were sworn to uphold. Out the window went property rights, presumption of innocence and even truth itself, as false witnesses took the limelight.Eric Hoffer, longshoreman philosopher of San Francisco, saw the same in California in the mid-1960s, when leftists trashed the University of California at Berkeley during the so-called Free Speech Movement.""The spark which set off the explosion was the discovery made by the students that the power structure of the university was manned by toothless lions,"" Hoffer wrote. ""President Clark Kerr, one of the finest products of his culture, knew how to build a great university but he had no idea how to defend it. He had not an inkling of the vulnerability of institutions — that they are more vulnerable than individuals — and did not know the first thing about the nature of authority.""Kerr's weakness led to the Watts riots in Los Angeles the next year, which both Hoffer and former California Assembly Speaker Willie Brown believed were closely connected to the events in Berkeley.That led to the rise of Ronald Reagan, who successfully ran for governor by defending institutions others were trying to bring down. In the wake of Ferguson, who will be our Reagan?
"
947,COP,"Law Enforcement: Despite a grand jury's exoneration of officer Darren Wilson after hearing all the evidence and testimony from key black witnesses, the attorney general pursues his vendetta. This is 2014, sir, not 1964.The lesson drawn from the grand jury decision in the shooting of Michael Brown is that if young blacks don't want to be shot by a police officer of any color, then don't rob a convenience store and don't wrestle that officer for his gun.It is a lesson lost on Attorney General Eric Holder, who plays with a deck that has 52 race cards in it and who thinks every police department is run by the descendants of Bull Connor.Despite the fact that a grand jury didn't see enough evidence to indict Wilson, Holder has announced that the federal investigation of the Brown shooting will continue, even though he has seen the same forensic evidence and witness testimony that the grand jury saw. There isn't a separate set of facts to be found.In a matter-of-fact presentation after the grand jury declined to indict Wilson, St. Louis County prosecutor Bob McCulloch laid out the evidence.He said that Brown, after a strong-arm robbery of a convenience store, was confronted by Wilson, who was aware of the robbery. Brown matched a description of the suspect.Multiple black witnesses testified to a struggle as Brown punched Wilson and struggled with him for his gun. Shots fired in the car were consistent with the gunpowder residue on Brown's thumb.Witnesses also testified that Brown later ran toward Wilson in ""full charge,"" not with his hands up, but with them tucked in his waistband. Wilson had no way of knowing that Brown, who had not been frisked, was not armed.Once you assault a police officer, everything that happens after that is on you. It was in fear for his life that Wilson shot the raging, 6-foot-4-inch, 289-pound man-child who had just rushed him. Which part of that does Holder dispute or not understand? If Brown had succeeded in the attack described by Wilson and witnesses, we might have one more dead cop and might not be having this conversation.One of the hidden ironies here is that McCulloch, who presented all the evidence and testimony available to the Ferguson grand jury along with the five possible options for an indictment of Wilson, was a member of the 2008 Obama Missouri Truth Squad.According to a September 2008 CBS St. Louis affiliate report, this offshoot of the Obama campaign was ""asking Missouri law enforcement to target anyone who lies or runs a misleading television ad during the presidential campaign.""McCulloch, now accused of being the tip of the spear for a racist police state, spent 2008 trying to get Obama elected as the first African-American president of the United States. He is no white supremacist with police dogs and fire hoses.Last year, 76 police officers were killed in the line of duty, and we doubt Holder could name one of them without looking it up. This statistic includes shootings in Chicago, where ""communities of color"" see blacks killing blacks at an appalling rate that fails to spark administration concern or action.The Ferguson, Mo., of 2014 is not the Selma, Ala., of 1965, where on March 7 of that year some 600 civil-rights marchers were met by state troopers who attacked them with dogs, billy clubs and tear gas. This is not the Jim Crow era, and Michael Brown was not marching for civil rights as he walked away from the convenience store that officials say he had just robbed, clutching stolen cigars.If Holder has found a different set of facts that contradicts those that have been established, he should let everyone know.If not, he needs to call off his vendetta.
"
948,COP,"War On Terror: As Obama pulls combat troops out of the Taliban's main stronghold, the Taliban have unleashed a torrent of terrorist attacks on the Afghan capital. We're witnessing the Iraqification of Afghanistan.This past week, a Taliban suicide bomber slipped by several security checkpoints and entered the office of Kabul's top cop at the city's police headquarters — one of the capital's most guarded compounds. The terrorist killed the police chief's chief of staff and injured several others.Within an hour, a second Taliban bomber attacked a bus full of soldiers.The next day, three more bombs detonated across Afghanistan, killing at least 10 Afghan police officers.A Taliban spokesman claimed credit for the string of bombings targeting Afghan security forces that are being left to defend the newly elected government by our pusillanimous commander in chief.The Taliban offensive comes on the heels of Obama's abrupt and unceremonious withdrawal of U.S. Marines from Helmand province, a Taliban stronghold.On Oct. 26, Obama ordered Marines to turn over Camp Leatherneck to the Afghan military, which is infested with Taliban operatives and sympathizers.Only a few other American military installations remain in country.Obama hopes to pull all combat troops out of Afghanistan by year-end, doubling down on the mistakes he made in Iraq.But don't worry; his top diplomat, John Kerry, is sending in multimillion-dollar satellite TV broadcast trucks armed with cameras to film Afghan sporting events — equipment that, at this rate, will no doubt be hijacked and used by the Taliban to film beheadings in the soccer stadium once they retake Kabul.You can't make this stuff up.As Obama quietly orders our troops to high-tail it out of Taliban-controlled territories in Afghanistan, the secretary of state is sending in TV equipment to provide the country better sports coverage!The inspector general for Afghan reconstruction recently fired off a letter to Kerry demanding a full accounting of $3.6 million in tax dollars he overspent on TV broadcast trucks for Afghanistan to cover ""live sporting events, such as Buzkashi, soccer, cricket and other sports."" The MSRP on the three trucks was $111,000.Talk about misplaced priorities.The administration is worried about nation building, while the resurgent Taliban threatens to take over the nation.Why are we building a TV network for Afghans? What they need is a security network led by American combat troops to protect them from the Taliban.Without the troops Obama's pulling out, Afghanistan's security situation could go south even more rapidly than it has in Iraq.All that's standing between our client government in Kabul and the Taliban and al-Qaida terrorists is the weak, Taliban-riddled Afghan security force.If you think Iraq is a bloodbath, just wait until next year in Afghanistan.
"
949,COP,"Racial Politics: Under the Constitution, police have the same rights to due process as citizens. Yet Democratic politicians pandering for urban votes seek to deny Darren Wilson his.On Tuesday night, on the eve of a grand jury hearing over the Wilson-Michael Brown shooting case, Missouri's Democratic governor, who reportedly has 2016 White House aspirations, delivered a grossly irresponsible address calling for a ""vigorous prosecution"" of the Ferguson cop, whom he gratuitously noted shot Brown ""in broad daylight.""Gov. Jay Nixon also demanded ""justice for Michael Brown"" and his family, echoing the calls of the looters, protesters and race merchants.He did not ask for a ""vigorous"" investigation or ""justice"" based on the facts. No, he's already rendered a verdict — guilty — further endangering the life of Wilson, who's already received death threats.""We're very concerned about the due process rights of Darren,"" Missouri police union President Sgt. Kevin Ahlbrand said, slamming the governor for ""rushing to judgment."" ""You'd think he'd wait before all the facts are in before making his conclusion.""Indeed, one would expect the state's chief executive to be more judicious than the activist liberal press, which has already tried and convicted Wilson. But Nixon might as well have said the grand jury must come down with an indictment.The railroading of this decorated police officer is all the more disturbing against the unraveling narrative of the mob. It turns out from forensic evidence that Wilson did not shoot Brown in the back, as some oft-quoted witnesses claimed.And police officials insist Brown was the aggressor during the stop, punching Wilson in the face and causing an injury that required hospitalization (Fox News is now reporting the officer suffered a shattered eye socket, among other head injuries). Most key, they say Brown then went for the officer's gun during a struggle in his cruiser.One credible eyewitness (as opposed to Brown's robbery accomplice, Dorian Johnson, the media's favorite witness) is recorded at the time saying he saw the 6-4, 292-pound Brown charge, not surrender to, Wilson when Wilson shot him.By all credible accounts, it appears Wilson did not execute Brown ""in cold blood"", but shot him in self defense in a justifiable, if tragic, homicide.Nixon is the same person who relieved the local police of riot control in a political move that's only led to more rioting and looting.He replaced the white Ferguson police chief with an African-American state trooper, whose biased and sympathetic actions have encouraged the bad actors now plaguing Ferguson.Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson has marched with some of the same militants who've incited the mob to kill Wilson. He's raised the arm of racial arsonist Jesse Jackson in the air. He's spoken at at least one Al Sharpton rally, where he apologized for police doing their job and glorified the gang culture that's led so many young black men astray.""When this is over, I'm going to go in my son's room, my black son, who wears his pants sagging, wears his hat cocked to the side, has tattoos on his arms, but that's my baby,"" Johnson said. ""And we all ought to be thanking the Browns for Michael, because Michael is going to make it better for our sons.""His own son ""deals with the same thing,"" he claimed.Ferguson's mayor complained that Johnson ordered police to ""stand down"" in the face of looters. When his own ""community"" turned on him, the streets exploded into violence, with more businesses looted and innocent people shot.Johnson's hug-a-looter policy has failed. Now he's removed curfew. He doesn't want to enforce that, either.It's plain he's too emotionally invested to defuse this powder keg, which could explode again if the grand jury doesn't indict. Johnson should be relieved of that command for a more objective professional.We're not sure Wilson's use of lethal force was right. But we do know that the governor putting his thumb on the scales and demanding political justice is not.

"
951,COP,"Leadership: Just when you thought the president couldn't pick anyone more radical than Eric Holder as attorney general, he's poised to name ultraradical race-baiter Thomas Perez.Holder's activism is no secret. But Perez is even more extreme. Worse, he's a liar and possible perjurer. Yet he's reportedly President Obama's pick to replace Holder as America's top cop enforcing the nation's laws.The Beltway media are reporting that Perez, now serving as labor secretary, is the front-runner for the key post — and he didn't deny it when reporters asked him about it at a recent speech.The Congressional Hispanic Caucus and other Latino groups have pressured President Obama to appoint the second Latino attorney general.That's because Perez is an activist of the most radical stripe, dating back to his days as a leftist political agitator in Maryland, and certainly not someone cut out to be an impartial arbiter of the laws of the land.The former Civil Rights Division chief is an agenda driver for the ""social justice"" wing of the Democrat Party. He won't helm the Justice Department to enforce laws equally — or enforce them at all in the case of illegal immigration.As he revealed in a speech last week, he's all about getting more immigrants in to vote for Democrats and redistributing wealth. Perez told the National Press Club the country needs to ""fix our broken immigration system"" by expanding legal status for immigrants through ""aggressive executive action,"" which he said will bring about more ""shared prosperity.""Obama knows better than to announce such a radical appointment before next month's key midterm election. It would only aid Republicans, who threaten to take Senate control. Rather, he'll wait until after the election. If the GOP wins big, he's expected to ram through his nod in the lame-duck session.But Republicans must fight to block this nomination. Perez should never be attorney general. He wasn't even qualified to be Maryland's. He was kicked off the ballot there in a 2006 bid for state attorney general because the local political activist hadn't practiced law long enough to meet the constitutional requirement.Perez is also a dangerous a race-baiter — and a shameless liar to boot. He recently told an all-black crowd at Howard University that he learned while visiting a Mississippi school district that officials were locking up black kids for passing gas. He used the anecdote as an example of lingering white racism in the Deep South.But according to the New York Post, the school superintendent — who happens to be black — denied the whole story and said Perez never even visited.School administrators aren't the only people Perez has framed as racists. He's also compared bankers to Klansmen who practice a more ""subtle"" kind of racism that's ""every bit as destructive as the cross burned in a neighborhood.""As civil rights chief, Perez sabotaged a landmark housing discrimination case before the Supreme Court to protect his use of the dubious ""disparate impact"" theory to shake down bankers for billions in payola. When Congress investigated, Perez swore he didn't personally intervene in the case, though emails and voicemails say otherwise.In fact, the evidence shows Perez went out of his way to derail the Supreme Court case — including flying to meet with the petitioners to get them to drop the case, then insisting they not leave a paper trail.These and other actions by Perez during his career as a radical legal activist are ethically challenged at best, and flat out illegal or morally wrong at worst.Be forewarned: Your next attorney general could be a perjurer as well as one of the most radical operatives in the administration.

The windows of the buildings were popping out, breaking into shards and raining glass at high velocity to the ground.Soon Tobin saw people trapped above the impact zones, jumping out of the 110-story buildings — some jumping in groups, holding hands — to avoid the inferno that resulted from the attacks.She was no longer there in a press capacity but as a police officer assisting in an evacuation.HonoredAmong her numerous awards, Tobin received the NYPD's Medal of Valor. Her citation reads: ""Awarded for an act of outstanding personal bravery intelligently performed in the line of duty at imminent personal hazard to life under circumstances evincing a disregard of personal consequences.""Congress also applauded her, recognizing her ""heroism, bravery and sacrifice during the tumultuous events"" of 9/11.Tobin is currently an inspector — a commanding officer of collaborative policing — in the NYPD.""Sept. 11, 2001,"" she told IBD, ""just reaffirmed for me I'm doing exactly what I was meant to do in life.""Some 3,000 people died in the terrorist attacks in New York and the Pentagon. Also succumbing in the massacre were 343 firefighters and 72 law enforcement personnel.""As awful as looking at the numbers of people that we lost on that day are, for every one person that died, we were able to get 10 people out of the buildings, and I think that's remarkable,"" Tobin said. ""I remain in awe of all emergency services, not just police department but the fire department (and) also people that were really there to rescue people. I think that was truly a blessing that we were as well trained as we were.""Susan Herman, Tobin's supervisor and the NYPD's deputy commissioner of collaborative policing, said: ""Terri is an outstanding police officer because she has a very clear sense of right and wrong. She has an extraordinary work ethic, and she has just real common sense about how to relate to people, how to size up the situation quickly and take action. She's decisive, she's clear, and she has excellent judgment. I don't think the NYPD could have a better representative than Terri Tobin.""Former supervisor Fahey said: ""Terri's a very dedicated, conscientious and very willing person to deal with. She was always willing to help other officers or teach other people what had to be done.""Born in Queens, N.Y., Tobin grew up watching her father and uncle perform police duty. She and three siblings have followed in their patriarch's footsteps and example.""My father was the best advertisement for policing,"" she said. ""It was really obvious that he enjoyed his job. Both my parents strongly believed in public service as careers.""Tobin's mom and dad were also proponents of education.Her father often worked second and third jobs to send all of his five children to Catholic school and through college.Tobin caught the education bug early. She has a bachelor's degree in sociology and social work from Marist College in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., a master's in social work from Fordham and a Ph.D. in criminal justice from the State University of New York, Albany.""It was a value that was strongly held growing up — understand human nature,"" Tobin said.Upon joining the NYPD at age 21, Tobin started off as a patrol officer. She rose to sergeant and switched to the narcotics program, working to get kids to say no to drugs.As she looks back at the battle zone of 9/11, Tobin recalls rescuers maintaining calm amid chaos.She told Susan Hagen and Mary Carouba, authors of ""Women at Ground Zero,"" ""For people coming out of the Towers ... it wasn't mass confusion. Every five feet there was a cop saying, very calmly, 'Please exit to your left.' ... So there was this very obvious route. Just follow the blue. At the same time, firefighters were coming in and going up. The response by emergency personnel was just phenomenal.""As people jumped to their death, cops stood guard with binoculars, making sure that others escaping the towers weren't hit by debris.The CrashTobin went to the South Tower after putting on a Kevlar helmet.She then headed back to her car to put on more nimble shoes when she heard a rumble. ""It sounded like a train. ... I was thinking, where is this train coming from?""Next, she saw people running toward her, screaming: ""Go! Go! It's coming down.""""Just for a second I looked up and saw it,"" Tobin said of the ocean of debris from the pancaked building barreling toward her.The sheer power of it threw her across a four-lane highway and landed her face down on grass outside the World Financial Center.Coming out of a daze, Tobin found herself lying face down, covered to her chest in debris.Her ankle was broken, and a cement projectile had cracked the Kevlar helmet and embedded itself in the back of her skull.The helmet took enough force of the object to save Tobin's life, but the impact would cause her to have two-thirds of her teeth replaced.As she came out of her daze, she made out the silhouette of a firefighter's helmet lying next to her. The fireman asked Tobin if she was OK and told her to cover her mouth and nose with the front of her blouse.Tobin then reached around and grabbed someone's hand. As she staggered to get to her feet, she wanted to pull the person up with her. But there was no person attached; it was a severed arm.Two medics found Tobin and tried to tend to her, but they didn't try to pull the cement out of her head and wrapped the wound instead.The ChaosTobin shook off her wounds fast. Along with the medics and firefighter, she responded to the cries for help of others trapped by debris. Then another group of people ran toward them, yelling that the South Tower was coming down.As Tobin ran from the crash, she was whacked in the back by the pane of glass, which missed her lungs and arteries. She made her way inside an apartment building, staying away from the two huge windows in front of it.She found the door to the stairwell, went in and saw 100 people. With her head bandaged, her pantyhose torn and all of her covered in dust, she may not have looked like an authority figure, but she acted like one.Winning the people's confidence, she led everyone to the lobby. ""What you do when you need to evacuate a building is make sure there's a clear path out, make sure there are people being given direction, make sure everyone is on the same page,"" she said.Tobin opened the front door and flagged down two men from her department's Technical Assistance Response Unit, saying ""Listen, we've got to get these people out.""One of the guys told her they'd carry her to a boat evacuating people to New Jersey, but she declined. She could walk fine, said Tobin, who recalled: ""Then he said, 'Terri, there's a window pane stuck though your back, between your shoulder blades.'""At a hospital, doctors cut the cement projectile out of her head and cleaned out her back.Since she suffered a head injury, anesthesia could not be administered. In addition, she had more than 80 stitches, a bruised kidney and the broken ankle.Herman wasn't surprised about Tobin's actions: ""Terri never forgets her responsibilities to others and that she's here to serve.""

974,COP,"Aggression: Less than 48 hours after President Obama vowed to ""defend Estonia,"" Russian goons kidnapped an Estonian cop to demonstrate just what U.S. red lines are worth. Any questions as to the nature of the threat?The abduction of Internal Security Service officer Eston Kohver from Estonia was no ordinary criminal act.The Russians who took him jammed police radios, tossed a smoke grenade, seized Kohver and marched him into Russia at gunpoint. They then falsely claimed that he was caught spying on Russian soil.It was nonsense. Estonia's leaders have said it was clearly a targeted attack and very serious, coming as it did two days after Obama made his strongest-worded speech ever on U.S. commitment to the NATO alliance.""The defense of Tallinn and Riga and Vilnius is just as important as the defense of Berlin and Paris and London,"" Obama said. ""Article Five is crystal clear. An attack on one is an attack on all.""So if, in such a moment, you ever ask again, who will come to help, you'll know the answer: the NATO alliance, including the armed forces of the United States of America, right here, present, now.""Well, it's into the ""right here, present, now"" that Vladimir Putin has stuck his face.His swift effort to nullify Obama's words is no different from his immediate neutralization of Obama's red line in Syria, a chess move that left Putin the dominant player in that country.With this latest provocation, on the heels of his invasion of Ukraine, as well as new airspace incursions over the Baltics and even Finland, Putin has again made the promises of the leader of the Free World sound hollow.The message here is that Russia can do whatever it likes in the region that it considers its near abroad, and no NATO alliance is going to be effective in stopping it.The Kohver abduction will have a terrible effect on Eastern Europe, which has just seen a bullied Ukraine sign a ""peace"" treaty with Russia. Ukraine had no choice, since the U.S. and EU failed to do much to help it defend itself.Putin picked on Estonia because it had the gall to host an American president and to forge an alliance with NATO. No doubt, he wants to see if NATO is a real mutual defense alliance — or a paper tiger.

975,COP,"More Guns, Less Crime: Since Illinois began issuing concealed-carry permits this year, robberies, burglaries, car thefts and, yes, even murder, are down significantly.Last month, when an 86-year-old Crestwood, Ill., man decided to visit his local phone store, he arrived to find a robbery underway. After staying outside to keep others from entering the store, he saw the suspect fleeing through a back door. He pursued the suspect, legal firearm in hand, stopped him, then held him until police arrived to make the arrest.The actions of the unidentified law-abiding citizen were made possible by Illinois becoming the 50th and final state to enact a concealed-carry law, legislation that, as it has done nationwide, coincides with a precipitous drop in the Chicago crime rate.Chicago Police Superintendent Gerry McCarthy, at a recent city council hearing, reported the good news of less crime. He credited better police work, but there's another factor McCarthy left unstated — the increase in the number of pistol-packing permits that let citizens defend themselves, their families and their neighbors. The law has left criminals uncertain of who might be able to shoot back.""It isn't any coincidence that crime rates started to go down when concealed carry was permitted,"" Richard Pearson, executive director of the Illinois State Rifle Association, said in the Washington Times.""Just the idea that criminals don't know who is armed and who isn't has a deterrent effect. The police department hasn't changed a single tactic — they haven't announced a shift in policy — and you have these incredible numbers.""As of the end of July, Illinois had received 83,183 applications and had issued 68,549 concealed-carry licenses, with many more expected. According to media reports, the Chicago Police Department says robberies leading to arrests have dropped 20% from last year while reports of burglary and motor vehicle theft have declined 20% and 26%. The homicide rate hit a 56-year low in the first quarter of this year.On Feb. 22 of last year, a 5-4 majority of the 10-member U.S. 7th Court of Appeals upheld an earlier decision by a three-member panel that addressed the absurdity and inconsistency of Illinois gun laws that allow ownership of a firearm, but not the right to carry it outside the home. In other words, the ""right to keep, but not to bear, arms.""Chicago's long-standing attempt to deny its citizens their full Second Amendment rights under the Constitution met another court defeat recently when U.S. District Judge Edmond Chang said the city ban on retail gun shops owned by licensed dealers went too far to count as a ""sensible restriction"" on gun ownership to prevent gun violence.""The ban on gun sales and transfers,"" wrote Chang in a 35-page opinion, ""prevents Chicagoans from fulfilling, within the limits of Chicago, the most fundamental prerequisite of legal gun ownership — that of simple acquisition.""Chang found the city's ""blanket ban"" on sales and transfers of firearms violated the constitutional right to keep and bear arms.The current fight to protect the Second Amendment began with the late Otis McDonald, an Army veteran who lived in a high-crime area of Chicago and who succumbed this year to cancer but not gang violence. He won his case asserting that the Second Amendment he fought to protect gave him the right to bear arms to protect himself and his wife, just as he once protected his country, and that the amendment meant what it said — his right to bear arms shall not be infringed.Gang and drive-by shootings remain a major problem in Chicago. But the trend in issuing more concealed-carry permits as crime rates drop reflects the effect of an increasingly armed citizenry that feels a firearm in the hand is sometimes better than a cop on the phone.

976,COP,"Crime: Attorney General Eric Holder's star witness in the allegedly racist police shooting of a black St. Louis teen is a hoodlum with a history of making false statements to police.Dorian Johnson, 22, the main source of the media's racist cop narrative, has lost all credibility. So why is Holder still taking his testimony? And why isn't he behind bars?An ABC News affiliate in St. Louis reported that Johnson is wanted in Jefferson City, Mo., on a 2011 theft charge and also for filing a false police report that same year. Johnson allegedly gave a bogus name and age to investigators in the case.Johnson was walking with Michael Brown when his friend ""Big Mike"" was shot by a local patrolman. He told reporters and anyone who would listen that the unarmed Brown was ""shot like an animal"" by a ""white cop,"" as he raised his hands to surrender.""Me and my friend was walking down the street, wasn't causing any harm to nobody,"" he said, when Officer Darren Wilson pulled up in his patrol car and ""reached his arm out the window and grabbed my friend around his neck. ... (He) was trying to choke my friend.""He claimed Brown broke loose and started to run away when Wilson shot him from behind, then finished him off at close range, execution style.His chillingly vivid account spurred nationwide protests, including the looting and torching of dozens of businesses. Civil rights leaders embraced Johnson. So did Holder.But then, piece by piece, his story started to fall apart.First came the release of a video from a liquor store surveillance camera showing Johnson involved in a robbery with Brown just moments before the shooting. A police report ID'd Johnson as a suspect (though charges were mysteriously dropped as federal authorities stepped in to investigate the case).Then came the family autopsy showing Brown was not, in fact, shot from behind.Next, a friend of Wilson described in a radio interview how Johnson and Brown pushed Wilson back into his patrol car as he opened the door to question them.And now we know Johnson has a habit of lying to authorities. His arrest record should sink his credibility as a key witness before the grand jury.

987,COP,"Racial Politics: We didn't think today's civil-rights leaders could lose more credibility after they covered up the facts in the Trayvon Martin case. But then along came Michael Brown.In both shooting incidents, Al Sharpton, Jesse Jackson, NAACP officials and others in the civil-rights movement-turned-grievance industry rushed to judge them as ""walking-while-black"" executions by racist whites, when in fact they were nothing of the kind.Martin and Brown weren't targeted because of skin color. Nor were they the innocent martyrs they were made out to be, as tragic as their deaths were.Like Martin, Brown seems to have been the aggressor in the tragic confrontation. And like Martin, he was no angel. Brown was stopped by police because he was the prime suspect in a ""strong-arm robbery"" at a nearby convenience store in the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson.These civil-rights leaders took the testimony of street thugs over the word of local police about what really happened. Now they have egg on their faces.One of the thugs turns out to have been Brown's accomplice in the robbery, Dorian Johnson, who is now lawyered up and copping to the crime.For days, Johnson was the ""key eyewitness"" stoking the flames of racial tension and helping spark days of looting and rioting by claiming a white cop shot his friend ""Big Mike"" in ""cold blood.""""We wasn't committing any crime, bringing no harm to nobody, but my friend was murdered in cold blood,"" as he spun it to a national media eager to believe the worst about white cops and race relations in America.Added the 22-year-old Johnson, ""We were just walking, minding our own business."" Yes, walking with your stolen loot from the Quick Trip.NBC bit hard, along with CNN, running an endless loop of Johnson saying his pal was ""shot like an animal"" by police, that he was ""executed"" as he raised ""his hands up,"" a description that inspired protest rallies in dozens of cities. Thousands of African-Americans across the country held up their hands and chanted or held up signs saying, ""Hands up, don't shoot!""""I definitely think he's guilty of murder,"" Johnson said, surrounded by protective civil-rights lawyers.""I don't understand why this officer"" was pursuing him or Brown, he said, shedding more crocodile tears.Now we know why. It wasn't because they were black.And we also know why Johnson refused to give an official statement to the police. He was wanted in a serious crime. He was an eyewitness to his own crime.Incredibly, civil-rights leaders were saving this ""credible testimony"" for Attorney General Eric Holder, who sent a team of prosecutors to investigate the Ferguson police force, just like the team he sent to Sanford, Fla., that came up empty-handed. Johnson was protected because he protected the false narrative of black profiling by racist white America.Curiously, Johnson, a wanted criminal, remained on the loose while doing TV interviews. Why wasn't he collared? Was Ferguson's police chief intimidated into not arresting this star ""eyewitness"" for the cause? Perhaps he feared jailing him would spark more riots.We wouldn't be surprised. Racial politics seems to be running law enforcement these days.Consider how, after complaints about the ""excessive show of force"" by local police in the wake of looting and torchings in the city, Missouri's Democrat governor put a black state trooper in charge of the town. It was argued that this African-American captain would calm the lawbreaking mobs because he had a more ""urban"" feel than the local white police chief.So let's get this straight: If cops aren't the right color, certain groups don't have to obey the laws those cops are sworn to enforce? Is that what we're saying now? Because if it is, we're more divided than we know.Don't get us wrong. We're not arguing that the public should leap to the defense of cops in such cases.When an unarmed minority teenager is shot, it raises major red flags. And no doubt there are rogue cops, even racist cops. So police brutality coupled with police bias is a real issue that shouldn't be swept aside as outside the realm of possibility, even today.But nor should we rush to prosecute or demonize cops without all the facts (are you listening, Mr. President?). Street cops have a tough and dangerous job. They put their lives on the line every day.It's disquieting to say the least to see civil-rights leaders drawing a ""moral equivalence"" between police and street rioters. To hear them, hoods and thugs are now more credible than cops. They're constantly standing up for these violent young thugs and giving them a pass because of their race.MLK didn't do that even in the most justifiable cases.In contrast, today's self-serving civil-rights movement cries wolf about police racism, excuses thuggery and nullifies law and order. We've come a long way since Selma, in more ways than one.

988,COP,"Iraq: The nation we liberated from Saddam Hussein elected a leader whose rule is now collapsing as jihadists threaten more turmoil. So much for the Democrats' theory that pressure would straighten things out.Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki's days look very numbered. It doesn't help that the leader of the free world has long made him and his fellow democratic Iraqi politicians convenient scapegoats for America's premature exit from what could have been a model of Arab freedom and prosperity.Al-Maliki's Iranian allies no longer have any appetite for helping him, and his domestic support is swiftly dissipating. But in a civilized, Western spirit, the much-maligned leader is insisting the rule of law remain paramount, boldly announcing he won't be pushed from office absent an Iraqi high court order.At the same time al-Maliki called the head of state's appointment of a new prime minister on Monday an attack on Iraq's constitution and judiciary, he rebuffed the idea of the military protecting him.For all the sectarian leanings al-Maliki has been accused of, often justifiably, that sounds like a man who values freedom and the rule of the people more than the average Muslim politician. It constitutes remarkable grace as a jihadist army rules a large swath of his country and Syria with merciless savagery.But let's step back. Haven't liberals in this country been telling us for a decade that pressure was the magic ingredient that would force Iraqis into political maturity? And how convenient that such a notion dovetailed with the wishes of their party's peacenik political base.In January 2007, drunk with the new power of their majority in both houses of Congress, then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid wrote to President Bush demanding that he ""move our forces out of Iraq and make the Iraqi political leadership aware that our commitment is not open ended, that we cannot resolve their sectarian problems and that only they can find the political resolution required to stabilize Iraq.""Seven-and-a-half years later, President Obama was serving up the same message: ""ultimately it's up to the Iraqis, as a sovereign nation, to solve their problems.""What a cop-out. Imagine your home being burgled and the police telling you on arrival that ""as a homeowner, ultimately it's up to you to solve your own problems."" Even if a more talented political manager were in power, Iraq would be in big trouble once U.S. troops pulled out before their job was done.History is full with examples of determined fanatics overwhelming even well-established democracies. France and Poland fell to the Nazis. And the political freedoms enjoyed in Russia under Alexander Kerensky were no match for Lenin's Bolsheviks.Obama, Reid and Pelosi were and are as wrong in their political analysis of Iraq as Democratic leaders have always been in their military assessments.

1101,COP,"Eco-Radicalism: The green lobby has finally come out and revealed its true intentions. No, a clean environment is not what it's working for. It's the death of capitalism.For more than a quarter-century, extreme green has menaced the public with terrifying stories of apocalyptic man-made global warming.It was all the movement had left. The environment in the developed world had been cleaned up after countries had gone through the growing pains of industrial development and economic maturity. So something else was needed to rage about.The fright campaign culminated this month with a meeting hosted by Venezuela's government and attended by 130 green groups. The U.N.-sponsored conference, known as Social Pre-COP, produced a final version of the Margarita Declaration. All this ""declaration"" does is call for the death of capitalism.""The structural causes of climate change are linked to the current capitalist hegemonic system,"" the declaration says. ""To combat climate change it is necessary to change the system.""Any doubts that this is what environmentalists have wanted all along should be allayed by the host nation's stated government policy that capitalism is a ""predator.""According to Global Climate Change News & Analysis, the declaration's supporters aren't interested in carbon trading. They don't even want to promote green economies. They just wish to kill capitalism.In some sense, the radical environmentalists are entering their prime. After decades of spreading fear, lies and exaggerations, after a long crusade of conditioning and training the public, they at last feel safe to move on to their final solution.With the possible exception of its earliest days, environmentalism was never about the environment or Earth. It was about replacing freedom with democratic socialism or outright statism. If it had been about the environment, green groups would have promoted capitalism and its wealth creation.Why is capitalism better for the environment?In part, because a prosperous nation can afford to be clean. We have the resources to mop up after ourselves and produce less-grubby industrial processes. A poorer nation can do neither. Capitalism also protects property rights, and private property is far less likely to be fouled than land that no one — or everyone — owns.The environmental differences between capitalism and its opposite could not be better exemplified than by the gap between West Germany and East Germany. After the Berlin Wall fell, the world discovered that the mostly capitalist west was far cleaner than the shabby communist country to the east.If the green lobby gets its way, it will reverse the environmental progress made not only in the former East Germany but in every other developed nation on Earth.

Which is ridiculous. Everyone knows Kerry’s made of wood.Conan: Amazon has introduced its own smartphone. You can tell it’s from Amazon because after you hang up with someone, the Amazon phone suggests other people you may want to call.Conan: Boxing Champ Floyd Mayweather posted on his Instagram that a half-dressed woman is “asking to be disrespected.” This from a guy who only wears shorts to work.Meyers: In the Wall Street Journal, Tyra Banks predicts that future people will have a robot. The article raises a lot of questions like, why is the Wall Street Journal interviewing Tyra Banks?Meyers: Police in a Washington town killed a loose cow after it tossed an officer in the air. I guess when cows get bored, they go cop-tipping.Conan: Starbucks has introduced its new decaf soda, called Fizzio. “Fizzio” is an Italian word that means, “Tastes OK, costs too much.”Fallon: A British firm is developing a new veggie -- Brussel-Kale. It's a combination of Brussels sprouts and kale. They got the idea from a child's nightmare.Meyers: Today is National Hammock Day. And just like a hammock, I can’t get into it.Conan: Floating in another galaxy, scientists have found a diamond the size of Earth. In a related story, Beyonce is building a space ship.Conan: At a Croatian animal sanctuary, two bears were always engaging in oral sex. Zookeepers got them to stop by making the bears get married.Meyers: At California’s Orange County Fair, they're selling bacon-wrapped churros, fried in bacon fat and filled with a half shot of Jack Daniels. And I hear they are simply to die of.Meyers: Iran has asked the U.S. for an extension of time to disable its nuclear program. Asked how much extra time it needed, Iran said, “10…9…8..” Meyers: Lay’s lists 'cappuccino' as a finalist for its new chip flavor contest. If you think that's bad, wait until you try Starbucks’ new 'Sour Cream & Onion Latte.'Conan: There’s currently a petition out to split California into several states. Among them would be Botoxia, Pornsylvania and the Commonwealth of Kardashia.Conan: The California drought is so bad that all water-wasting activity will be banned by early August. Yup, the drought is SO BAD they're taking extreme measures in two weeks.Conan: Some people are critical of Hillary Clinton’s speaking fees. The University of Buffalo paid Hillary $275,000 to speak. And apparently, Joe Biden got $300,000 not to speak.Conan: In a new interview, Dick Cheney said he thinks Barack Obama may be the worst president of his lifetime. Then today, Cheney got a thank-you note from Jimmy Carter.Conan: The U.S. Census Bureau has found that only 1.6% of adults identify themselves as gay. In other words, there are a lot of straight guys out there doing a lot of really gay stuff.Conan: Starbucks is opening its first stores in the nation of Colombia. Finally, someone is bringing coffee to Colombia.Conan: The other day in Seattle, a man set his home on fire trying to kill a spider with a can of spray paint and a lighter. On the bright side, the spider is definitely dead.Conan: Lady Gaga has agreed to make a $250,000 donation to assist California drought relief. Gaga also agreed to stop watering her hats.Fallon: A San Francisco man was arrested last week after he got drunk at the airport, then tried to pose as a TSA agent so he could give pat-downs to female travelers. People could tell something was up, because TSA agents generally don't shout, ""Ah-ooooga!!""Conan: The storyline of the upcoming Star Wars movie has leaked. The movie starts with R2D2, Chewbacca and Han Solo waking up in Vegas.Conan: Scientists have invented a cheese that even vegans can eat. Now scientists are working on inventing a vegan who doesn’t ask the waiter a million questions.RELATED:Record high job approval for the president -- of RussiaWith Obama on hand, a do-nothing Congress is a good thing

1132,COP,"Advice And Consent: In a stinging political defeat and a sign even Democrats are getting fed up with the White House's in-your-face radicalism, the Senate has rejected Obama's controversial nominee for civil rights chief.
"
1133,COP,"In 2011, the president selected radical NAACP lawyer Debo Adegbile for a federal judgeship. But when the liberal bar hesitated to endorse him, and it became clear he'd never survive a GOP filibuster, Obama withdrew his name from consideration.
"
1134,COP,"In November, however, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid took the drastic step of filibuster-proofing the Senate in order to ram though such radical nominees. In January, Obama re-nominated his old pal Adegbile — this time for the nation's top civil rights post at the Justice Department, where he could do maximum damage as the racialist wrecking ball that he is.
"
1135,COP,"In February, the Democrat-controlled Senate Judiciary Committee rubber-stamped Adegbile, and his final confirmation appeared a formality.
"
1136,COP,"But during Wednesday's full Senate floor vote, Adegbile turned out to be too radical for even some Democrats to stomach. Seven thought better of voting for the advocate of a cold-blooded racist murderer and defected, refreshingly putting decency above politics.
"
1137,COP,"Before the vote, we urged Republicans to invite the widow of the police officer Adegbile's client shot in the back to the gallery and dare Democrats to push the ""aye"" button (""Make Dems Sweat Before Confirming Cop Killer's Backer,"" Feb. 19).
"
1138,COP,"Maureen Faulkner ended up visiting individually with key Democrats before the vote to plead with them to honor her slain husband, Philly cop Daniel Faulkner, and not reward Adegbile for what she termed the ""revolting"" work he did on behalf of his killer — Black Panther Mumia Abu-Jamal.
"
1139,COP,"The appeals worked. Several Democrats switched sides, including Sens. Chris Coons, D-Del.; Bob Casey, D-Pa.; Mark Pryor, D-Ark.; Heidi Heitkamp, D-N.D.; Joe Manchin, D-W.Va.; Joe Donnelly, D-Ind.; and John Walsh, D-Mont.
"
1140,COP,"The Washington Post blamed election-year politics, arguing all seven defectors are ""politically vulnerable Democrats."" While that's certainly the case for Pryor, who faces a tough re-election and is running as fast as he can from the unpopular president, it's not as clear-cut for the others. Manchin explained, ""I made a conscientious decision after talking to the wife of the victim.""
"
1141,COP,"More likely, Democrats are feeling a little queasy supporting Obama and his increasingly militant appointments and their racialist agendas.
"
1142,COP,"Adegbile was way outside the mainstream, and made Democrats unnecessarily uncomfortable. His nod was a thumb in the eye of law enforcement, not to mention a cruel and heartless slap at Mrs. Faulkner.
"
1143,COP,"Adegbile didn't represent Abu-Jamal like some dutiful defense lawyer. He sought him out decades after he was convicted and actually helped lead the rallies to free him from death row.
"
1144,COP,"To this day, Abu-Jamal is an angry black Marxist who believes the American judicial system is racist — and that's precisely what Adegbile argued to help get his sentence reduced to life in prison.
"
1145,COP,"Adegbile, for his part, believes African-Americans still suffer from Jim Crow-era racism. He advocates abolishing the death penalty and thinks employers should be forced to hire black felons, and on and on.
"
1146,COP,"In other words, Obama's nominee supported more than just a cop-killing Black Panther. He supported and promoted his cause.
"
1147,COP,"To fiercely promote Adegbile to a position where he could enforce the nation's civil rights laws, the president must at least sympathize with that cause as well. Which makes this controversy all the more disturbing. And revealing.

1170,COP,"Moments later, Mumia Abu-Jamal, Cook's brother (aka Wesley Cook), showed up at the scene with a .38-caliber handgun and opened fire, hitting Faulkner, eyewitnesses said, in the back.

"
1172,COP,"Police found Faulkner fatally wounded and Abu-Jamal with a bullet wound in his chest and his .38-caliber handgun and five spent shell casings. Four eyewitnesses testified at his trial. A jury sentenced him to death.

1188,COP,"Apparently not in the Justice Department of President Obama and Attorney General Eric Holder.Justice: The nominee to head the Department of Justice's civil rights division is a radical lawyer who fought to free from prison a cold-blooded killer of a Philadelphia cop.On Dec. 9, 1981, Officer Danny Faulkner, 12 days from his 26th birthday, observed a car going the wrong way down a one-way street without its lights on.He pulled over the vehicle, and the driver, one William Cook, got out of the car and began wrestling with Faulkner.Moments later, Mumia Abu-Jamal, Cook's brother (aka Wesley Cook), showed up at the scene with a .38-caliber handgun and opened fire, hitting Faulkner, eyewitnesses said, in the back.Faulkner returned fire, wounding his assailant, who got off several more shots, including the one that hit Faulkner in the face at point-blank range, killing him.Police found Faulkner fatally wounded and Abu-Jamal with a bullet wound in his chest and his .38-caliber handgun and five spent shell casings. Four eyewitnesses testified at his trial. A jury sentenced him to death.The Pennsylvania Supreme Court upheld his conviction in 1995, and in 1998 it refused to grant his request for a new trial. In 1999 the U.S. Supreme Court declined to review Abu-Jamal's appeal.In December 2001, a federal judge overturned his death sentence but upheld his conviction. The U.S. Supreme Court rejected a second appeal in 2010.The bullet in Abu-Jamal came from Faulkner's gun. The bullets in Faulkner came from Abu-Jamal's weapon, and the question of Abu-Jamal's guilt has never been a close call.In a post on the Ventura County Star website, Faulkner's widow, Maureen, remembered Abu-Jamal, who, ""when taken to a hospital after he slaughtered my husband, to remove a bullet shot in self-defense from my husband's gun, said in front of two witnesses, 'I shot the (blank), and I hope the (blank) dies.'""His brother, William, has never testified to his brother's innocence though he was at the scene of the crime. Abu-Jamal himself chose not to testify in his own defense.Nonetheless, Abu-Jamal soon became a poster child for Democrats and the liberal left as a symbol of the racial bias of the criminal justice system and of the death penalty.One of Abu-Jamal's champions has been Debo Adegbile, President Obama's nominee to be assistant attorney general for the civil rights division at the Department of Justice (DOJ) to replace another radical, Tom Perez, who is now secretary of labor.Perez, a leading La Raza advocate and opponent of Voter ID laws, was heavily involved in the dropping by DOJ of the voter intimidation case involving the New Black Panthers at a Philadelphia polling place in 2008.Adegbile formerly held a leadership position at the Legal Defense and Education Fund (LDF) of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP).During Adegbile's leadership at the NAACP, Judicial Watch reports, he volunteered its services to represent Abu-Jamal, interestingly also a member of the Black Panthers.Adegbile is a staunch supporter of affirmative action who opposes criminal-background checks by employers and advocates extreme racial-hiring quotas.He has said he wants U.S. judges to ensure that ""customary international law"" is ""the law of the land.""According to World Net Daily, he also was party to an effort funded by billionaire George Soros to push for a new, ""progressive"" U.S. Constitution.Appearing Wednesday on Fox News' ""The Kelly File,"" Maureen Faulkner said that Obama's nomination of such a person to a top position at the Justice Department ""is like spitting on all our officers and our federal agents throughout America.""

1218,COP,"According to its official timetable, the Detroit bankruptcy is seven months from resolution, but there are already signs that the process won't prove as beneficial as expected. In recent deals with bondholders and pension funds, the city has caved to creditor demands, substantially reducing the fiscal relief it stands to gain from bankruptcy.For these and other bad deals that may follow, the timetable itself, not Emergency Manager Kevyn Orr, should bear most of the blame. Under pressure to settle the bankruptcy before his term in office ends this fall, Orr is losing the upper hand with creditors. It appears that in municipal bankruptcy, haste can lead to waste.Many factors contributed to Detroit's fiscal collapse, but its worst debt problems were all pension-related.Had Detroit never offered defined benefit pensions to its workers, its debt burden would be less than half the size it was when the city filed for bankruptcy last July. Gone would be the $3.5 billion in unfunded pension liability, as well as the $5.7 billion in retiree health care debt (employers don't offer health benefits to retirees unless they're also offering pensions).Since it's impossible for a defined contribution plan to be underfunded, Detroit would never have had to tap credit markets to fund retirement benefits. That would eliminate Detroit's $1.4 billion in pension obligation debt, whose interest rates, incidentally, were stabilized by swaps that in turn burdened the city budget with hundreds of millions in liabilities.Without any pension-related debt, Detroit would owe $7.5 billion in revenue and general obligation bonds. Had these been its sole debt commitments, the city probably could not have qualified for municipal bankruptcy.Orr, appointed by Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder in March 2013, understands the importance of pension reform for fiscal relief. Shortly before filing for bankruptcy, he called for ""significant cuts in accrued, vested pension amounts for both active and currently retired persons.""Orr has since walked back on that demand.On Tuesday, he announced settlements with both the city's retirement systems that will guarantee no cuts to accrued benefits for public safety members and only 4.5% cuts to non-uniformed workers and retirees.Just weeks prior, Orr had called for cuts of at least 6% and 26%, respectively and, for both, the elimination of cost-of-living increases. The public safety settlement partially reinstated the public safety members' cost-of-living increase.Wall Street, too, has benefited from Orr's eagerness to settle. Last week, some general obligation bondholders that were originally classified as ""unsecured"" creditors and positioned for 85% cuts agreed to a deal with the city that reclassified them as secured creditors facing only 25% cuts.Orr tried three times to settle the city's swap liability, initially at a recovery rate far above what most other creditors could expect.Only because Judge Steven Rhodes rejected the first two proposed deals as too generous to the swap counterparties did Orr manage to settle for $85 million (down from $230 million), a major win for taxpayers and other creditors.Judge Rhodes must still approve the pension and general obligation bond settlements, and workers and retirees must approve the former.Significant legal uncertainty surrounds how much Detroit could have extracted from any of these creditors. But, with the exception of a suit he filed to invalidate the city's pension borrowing, Orr seems determined not to press the city's case in court, even though litigation could yield deeper debt cuts. Litigation is expensive, and more importantly, time-consuming, and time is one thing Orr does not have.Public Act 436, Michigan's ""Local Financial Stability and Choice Act,"" lets a local government vote out its state-appointed emergency manager after 18 months.Orr can be removed in September, and his self-imposed deadline for exiting bankruptcy is Oct. 15. (It also bears mentioning that this a gubernatorial election year in Michigan and, all things being equal, Snyder would surely prefer to see progress with the bankruptcy before voters go the polls on Nov. 4.)Having a state-appointed emergency manager direct a municipal bankruptcy is a good idea for a few reasons. State appointees care less about politics (Orr can play the bad cop to Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan's good cop), relations between state and city will be more harmonious, and why should the same officials responsible for the bankruptcy be left in charge to lead the city back to solvency?But by sunsetting Orr's term in office, Public Act 436 has incentivized haste. $1,000-an-hour rent-seeking lawyers are not the sole reason for why bankruptcies tend to be expensive and lengthy. Municipal bankruptcy exists to provide insolvent cities such as Detroit a means to cut their debts, but the federal bankruptcy code also requires that creditors be treated as fairly as possible. Sometimes good law takes time.All may not be lost for Detroit. Some crucial negotiations remain and Judge Rhodes has shown himself willing to reject bad deals.The larger question is what lessons should be drawn from Detroit, which will not be the last city to face insolvency.Future cities on the brink will scrutinize Orr's approach to determine whether bankruptcy can help them, and if so, how to proceed. Eighteen months may not be enough time to overcome a fiscal catastrophe long in the making. Eide is a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute.

1221,COP,"Fueled by the stepped-up pace of offshore oil and gas exploration and drilling activity, deepwater equipment maker Dril-Quip has been enjoying a healthy growth spurt.
"
1222,COP,"Dril-Quip (DRQ) has logged double-digit profit growth in all but one of the past seven quarters. And if Wall Street is on the money, it will stay on the fast track. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters see full-year earnings climbing 41% to $4.16 a share. They expect a 31% rise in 2014 and an 18% increase in 2015.
"
1223,COP,"Dril-Quip makes offshore drilling and production equipment, which is well suited for use in the harsh deepwater environment and severe service applications. Almost all its products are geared for use in water more than 1,000 feet deep. They're used by major integrated, large independent and foreign national oil and gas companies in offshore areas throughout the world.
"
1224,COP,"What's spurring the uptick?
"
1225,COP,"""It's being caused by the proliferation of deepwater drilling on a global basis, and in particular the rebound in deepwater activity in the Gulf of Mexico,"" Barclays analyst James West told IBD in an email interview. ""Deepwater drilling continues to increase in every deepwater market around the world, driven by strong commodity prices and the desire of the integrated oil companies and national oil companies to discover new reserves.""
"
1226,COP,"Ocean Operator
"
1227,COP,"Subsea equipment is anything connected to the seabed. Dril-Quip also makes surface equipment, used mainly for flow control on offshore production platforms. It makes offshore rig equipment, too. Its products are used to explore for oil and gas from offshore drilling rigs, such as floating rigs and jack-up rigs, and for drilling and production of oil and gas wells on offshore platforms.
"
1228,COP,"Its broad product line includes products such as mudline hanger systems used in jack-up drilling operations to support the weight of various casing strings at the ocean floor while drilling a well. 
"
1229,COP,"All subsea-related products are in high demand globally, says West, and this is especially true for Dril-Quip's wellheads.
"
1230,COP,"According to a company filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission: Subsea wellheads are pressure-containing forged and machined metal housings in which casing hangers are landed and sealed subsea to suspend casing (downhole pipe). As drilling depth increases, successively smaller diameter casing strings are installed, each suspended by an independent casing hanger. The wellheads are utilized when drilling from floating rigs.
"
1231,COP,"Stepped-Up Exploration
"
1232,COP,"West says Dril-Quip is the leading provider of subsea exploration wellheads to the offshore industry.
"
1233,COP,"""The company is vertically integrated, which allows them to control product reliability and quality at every step of the manufacturing process,"" he adds.
"
1234,COP,"A telling sign of the accelerated pace of deepwater exploration and discovery came with an announcement from BP (BP) on Dec. 18.
"
1235,COP,"The oil and gas company giant said it has made a ""significant"" oil discovery at its Gila prospect, which it co-owns with ConocoPhillips (COP), in the deepwater U.S. Gulf of Mexico. This is BP's third discovery in recent years in the emerging Paleogene trend in the Gulf of Mexico and reflects its ongoing commitment to the U.S. offshore region, BP said in a press release.
"
1236,COP,"The well was drilled to a total depth of 29,221 feet. BP's Gila discovery could be good news for Dril-Quip, which already counts BP among its customers.
"
1237,COP,"In October, Dril-Quip announced a frame agreement with BP International for the supply of subsea wellhead equipment and related services. The contract provides the terms and conditions for worldwide call-off orders placed by BP for Dril-Quip's BigBore II-H series subsea wellhead systems. Orders previously placed by BP during 2013 were also governed by the terms of this contract. BP also has an option to extend the contract for an additional five-year period.
"
1238,COP,"Dril-Quip, which was not available for comment, did not disclose further details of the BP contract.
"
1239,COP,"In terms of other recent contracts, one of the most notable ones came in August 2012, when Dril-Quip was awarded a four-year contract by Petroleo Brasileiro Petrobras (PBR), Brazil's national oil company. At exchange rates in effect at the signing date, the contract was valued at $650 million, net of Brazilian taxes, if all the equipment under contract is ordered, says the company's most recent 10-Q SEC filing.
"
1240,COP,"To date, Petrobras has ordered $138 million in equipment from the $650 million Petrobras contract, West wrote in a Nov. 1 report.
"
1241,COP,"""We still expect this to reach around $160 million by the end of the year,"" he said. ""While there are no imminent large projects on the horizon, DRQ continues to see significant opportunities for smaller higher margin projects.""
"
1242,COP,"Backlogs And Bottom Line
"
1243,COP,"Overall, Dril-Quip is faring handsomely on the financial front. In the most recent third quarter, earnings surged 44% to $1.12 a share. Revenue rose 18% to $224.7 million.
"
1244,COP,"Increasing levels of deepwater drilling have driven the company's backlog to record levels, West says. Dril-Quip's backlog at Sept. 30 was about $1.15 billion, compared with about $747 million a year earlier.
"
1245,COP,"A number of forces are working together to bolster demand for Dril-Quip's products, including strong commodity prices and increased drilling activity.
"
1246,COP,"""As the oil and gas industry continues to recover, the number of floating rigs (the rig type where Dril-Quip equipment is normally utilized) actively drilling in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico continues to increase,"" the company stated in a 10-Q filing with the SEC.
"
1247,COP,"As of Sept. 30, there were 36 floating rigs actively drilling and an average of 36 for the first nine months of 2013, compared with a yearly average of 29 in 2012 and 18 for 2011.
"
1248,COP,"Dril-Quip's offshore rig equipment includes products such as drilling riser systems. The drilling riser system consists of lengths of riser pipe and associated riser connectors that secure one to another.
"
1249,COP,"Oil Price Impact
"
1250,COP,"Higher oil prices have been helping to drive drilling activity. In the third quarter, Brent Crude oil closing prices ranged between $103.19 per barrel and $117.15 per barrel with an average quarterly price of $110.23. That compares to a range of $95.28 per barrel and $117.48 per barrel with an average quarterly price of $109.63 per barrel for the same period in 2012, says the 10-Q.
"
1251,COP,"In its October Oil Market Report, the International Energy Agency forecast global demand for oil to be 91.0 million barrels per day for 2013, and to rise to 92.1 million barrels per day in 2014.
"
1252,COP,"West is upbeat about Dril-Quip's prospects: ""Revenue and margins have steadily improved,"" he said. ""We expect revenue in 2013 to increase by 20% year-over-year and for gross margins to rise by almost 200 basis points. We see continued high oil prices driving demand for deepwater activity and new deepwater rig deliveries helping to satiate this demand.""
"
1253,COP,"Morgan Stanley analysts aren't so upbeat. In a Dec. 1 report, they lowered the stock's rating to underweight from equal weight.

1254,COP,"""DRQ outperformed for several years on a robust exploration cycle and execution,"" they wrote. ""Going forward, the shift from exploration to development should weigh on relative performance, while we see few catalysts for the stock.""Fueled by the stepped-up pace of offshore oil and gas exploration and drilling activity, deepwater equipment maker Dril-Quip has been enjoying a healthy growth spurt.Dril-Quip (DRQ) has logged double-digit profit growth in all but one of the past seven quarters. And if Wall Street is on the money, it will stay on the fast track. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters see full-year earnings climbing 41% to $4.16 a share. They expect a 31% rise in 2014 and an 18% increase in 2015.Dril-Quip makes offshore drilling and production equipment, which is well suited for use in the harsh deepwater environment and severe service applications. Almost all its products are geared for use in water more than 1,000 feet deep. They're used by major integrated, large independent and foreign national oil and gas companies in offshore areas throughout the world.What's spurring the uptick?""It's being caused by the proliferation of deepwater drilling on a global basis, and in particular the rebound in deepwater activity in the Gulf of Mexico,"" Barclays analyst James West told IBD in an email interview. ""Deepwater drilling continues to increase in every deepwater market around the world, driven by strong commodity prices and the desire of the integrated oil companies and national oil companies to discover new reserves.""Ocean OperatorSubsea equipment is anything connected to the seabed. Dril-Quip also makes surface equipment, used mainly for flow control on offshore production platforms. It makes offshore rig equipment, too. Its products are used to explore for oil and gas from offshore drilling rigs, such as floating rigs and jack-up rigs, and for drilling and production of oil and gas wells on offshore platforms.Its broad product line includes products such as mudline hanger systems used in jack-up drilling operations to support the weight of various casing strings at the ocean floor while drilling a well. All subsea-related products are in high demand globally, says West, and this is especially true for Dril-Quip's wellheads.According to a company filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission: Subsea wellheads are pressure-containing forged and machined metal housings in which casing hangers are landed and sealed subsea to suspend casing (downhole pipe). As drilling depth increases, successively smaller diameter casing strings are installed, each suspended by an independent casing hanger. The wellheads are utilized when drilling from floating rigs.Stepped-Up ExplorationWest says Dril-Quip is the leading provider of subsea exploration wellheads to the offshore industry.""The company is vertically integrated, which allows them to control product reliability and quality at every step of the manufacturing process,"" he adds.A telling sign of the accelerated pace of deepwater exploration and discovery came with an announcement from BP (BP) on Dec. 18.The oil and gas company giant said it has made a ""significant"" oil discovery at its Gila prospect, which it co-owns with ConocoPhillips (COP), in the deepwater U.S. Gulf of Mexico. This is BP's third discovery in recent years in the emerging Paleogene trend in the Gulf of Mexico and reflects its ongoing commitment to the U.S. offshore region, BP said in a press release.The well was drilled to a total depth of 29,221 feet. BP's Gila discovery could be good news for Dril-Quip, which already counts BP among its customers.In October, Dril-Quip announced a frame agreement with BP International for the supply of subsea wellhead equipment and related services. The contract provides the terms and conditions for worldwide call-off orders placed by BP for Dril-Quip's BigBore II-H series subsea wellhead systems. Orders previously placed by BP during 2013 were also governed by the terms of this contract. BP also has an option to extend the contract for an additional five-year period.Dril-Quip, which was not available for comment, did not disclose further details of the BP contract.In terms of other recent contracts, one of the most notable ones came in August 2012, when Dril-Quip was awarded a four-year contract by Petroleo Brasileiro Petrobras (PBR), Brazil's national oil company. At exchange rates in effect at the signing date, the contract was valued at $650 million, net of Brazilian taxes, if all the equipment under contract is ordered, says the company's most recent 10-Q SEC filing.To date, Petrobras has ordered $138 million in equipment from the $650 million Petrobras contract, West wrote in a Nov. 1 report.""We still expect this to reach around $160 million by the end of the year,"" he said. ""While there are no imminent large projects on the horizon, DRQ continues to see significant opportunities for smaller higher margin projects.""Backlogs And Bottom LineOverall, Dril-Quip is faring handsomely on the financial front. In the most recent third quarter, earnings surged 44% to $1.12 a share. Revenue rose 18% to $224.7 million.Increasing levels of deepwater drilling have driven the company's backlog to record levels, West says. Dril-Quip's backlog at Sept. 30 was about $1.15 billion, compared with about $747 million a year earlier.A number of forces are working together to bolster demand for Dril-Quip's products, including strong commodity prices and increased drilling activity.""As the oil and gas industry continues to recover, the number of floating rigs (the rig type where Dril-Quip equipment is normally utilized) actively drilling in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico continues to increase,"" the company stated in a 10-Q filing with the SEC.As of Sept. 30, there were 36 floating rigs actively drilling and an average of 36 for the first nine months of 2013, compared with a yearly average of 29 in 2012 and 18 for 2011.Dril-Quip's offshore rig equipment includes products such as drilling riser systems. The drilling riser system consists of lengths of riser pipe and associated riser connectors that secure one to another.Oil Price ImpactHigher oil prices have been helping to drive drilling activity. In the third quarter, Brent Crude oil closing prices ranged between $103.19 per barrel and $117.15 per barrel with an average quarterly price of $110.23. That compares to a range of $95.28 per barrel and $117.48 per barrel with an average quarterly price of $109.63 per barrel for the same period in 2012, says the 10-Q.In its October Oil Market Report, the International Energy Agency forecast global demand for oil to be 91.0 million barrels per day for 2013, and to rise to 92.1 million barrels per day in 2014.West is upbeat about Dril-Quip's prospects: ""Revenue and margins have steadily improved,"" he said. ""We expect revenue in 2013 to increase by 20% year-over-year and for gross margins to rise by almost 200 basis points. We see continued high oil prices driving demand for deepwater activity and new deepwater rig deliveries helping to satiate this demand.""Morgan Stanley analysts aren't so upbeat. In a Dec. 1 report, they lowered the stock's rating to underweight from equal weight.""DRQ outperformed for several years on a robust exploration cycle and execution,"" they wrote. ""Going forward, the shift from exploration to development should weigh on relative performance, while we see few catalysts for the stock.""

1359,COP,"While many parts of the country have not fully emerged from the housing crisis and recession, Texas continues on a tear with new building and thriving residential and commercial real estate markets.
"
1360,COP,"And that shows no sign of letting up.
"
1361,COP,"Construction crews are finishing office towers, industrial buildings, rental apartments and single-family homes — and breaking ground on others to meet demand from expanding businesses and the growing number of people who work for them and need homes.
"
1362,COP,"Single-family homebuilding rebounded dramatically in 2012 after a trough in 2011 and is on pace to gain this year while home sales also rebounded in 2012 from a 2010 trough, with more gains on pace this year, said Mark Dotzour, chief economist of the Real Estate Center at Texas A&M University.
"
1363,COP,"""Apartment construction has been happening throughout the Great Recession because of the continuous increase in population and employment levels,"" Dotzour told IBD by email.

"
1365,COP,"Dallas led major U.S. office markets in vacancy rate improvements in the third quarter with a 100 basis point drop to 18.1%, according to real estate services giant CBRE Group (CBG). Demand came from the professional services sector — insurance, technology and financial services.

"
1367,COP,"What's different from some other parts of the U.S.? A solid economy. The building- and business-friendly state sat out most of the housing bubble, which helped it through the recession. And it doesn't hurt that Texas is a capital of the booming energy industry.

"
1371,COP,"The state added 24,200 construction jobs over the past 12 months through August, the latest detailed data available. That's 14% of the 168,000 added nationally, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data. Texas boasts 611,300 construction jobs despite an August dip. Economists and property developers say the construction boom throughout the state, whether office, housing or industrial, is being fueled by one main driver: jobs.
"
1372,COP,"""The big picture in Texas that sets it apart is the incredible job growth,"" said Adam Saphier, president of central Texas operations for Trammell Crow, the national development firm and subsidiary of CBRE.
"
1373,COP,"Texas employment leveled off during the summer. But payrolls are still 932,600 jobs higher than in January 2008, when national payrolls peaked. The rest of the U.S. is still down 2.85 million.
"
1374,COP,"Job growth in Houston, Dallas and Austin is twice that of the national average, Saphier said. Houston alone added 13,000 jobs in the last year. The state's 6.4% jobless rate is almost a full percentage point below the national rate, even with heavy migration from other states.
"
1375,COP,"""Houston is one of the hottest office markets in the country right now,"" said Ken Simonson, chief economist of construction trade group the Associated General Contractors of America, adding that most areas of the country still aren't seeing much new office construction.

"
1390,COP,"That can be good if you're a developer first in on a new cycle, he said.
"
1391,COP,"""But if you're last to the party it's not going to work out well. There is always new construction popping up next to your building,"" Reagan said.
"
1392,COP,"Overdevelopment in the past has left Dallas' office market with a legacy of high vacancy rates. But they have been falling lately.
"
1393,COP,"Houston's office market had an office vacancy rate of 30% in 1983 after oil prices collapsed. And when Houston-based Enron imploded in the early 2000s, the somewhat recovered market saw offices empty out again.
"
1394,COP,"Houston avoided overbuilding in the most recent recession. And surging demand for space has lowered the office vacancy rate to around 14% even as new supply has come on, well below the national average of 17%, Reagan said.
"
1395,COP,"""The ongoing risk of new supply always needs to be front of mind if you're expanding in Texas,"" Reagan warned.
"
1396,COP,"But supply and demand are pretty much in balance across the state now. Texas is in the ""middle innings"" of its recovery, he said.
"
1397,COP,"""It definitely did not fall as much as other parts of the country, and it started to recover more quickly,"" he said.
"
1398,COP,"The perky housing market in Texas is contributing to the Lone Star State's growing economy. Three of the top-10 U.S. metro markets with the highest number of annual housing starts are in Texas, according to a recent Metrostudy report. Houston and Dallas/Fort Worth are at the top of the list, while Austin places ninth.
"
1399,COP,"Unlike other land-constrained Sunbelt states such as Florida, Texas still has lots of land for development. That's one reason home prices didn't rise as much during the housing boom. And so they didn't fall as much, either.
"
1400,COP,"The 2011 single-family housing market in Texas saw just 67,254 building permits issued, Dotzour notes. The next year permits were up to 81,926, and this year is apt to notch 90,000. Residential-home sales volume, which were down to 203,637 as reported in the Multiple Listing Service in 2010, increased to 238,056 by 2012, Dotzour said. He estimated sales would reach more than 280,000 units this year.

1407,COP,"ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report) is giving more importance to the Eagle Ford shale play than the crowded Permian Basin, per Ryan Lance, CEO of the upstream energy giant.Since mid-2016, there are has been a steep rise in oil rig count in the Permian Basin, where the number of rigs currently stands at more than 400, per U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). Meanwhile, in the Eagle Ford, the count is considerably lower at less than 100.In terms of production, the EIA graph shows consistent growth in the Permian Basin. Since mid-2016, the growth gets steeper and production is now heading toward 3.5 million barrels per day. Meanwhile the latest EIA data shows that production in Eagle Ford is below 1.5 million barrels a day.With the gradual recovery in crude that started after the commodity touched multi-year lows in early 2016, majority of the drillers and explorers flocked to the Permian Basin. This has resulted in a bump up in cost of production in Permian Basin following a bottleneck in oil pipeline and labor shortage.ConocoPhillips is expecting to benefit from the current scenario as cost of operations in the Eagle Ford is relatively lower. The company’s prime focus on the Eagle Ford is reflected in the first-quarter 2018 production picture. Through the quarter, the company’s daily oil equivalent production from the Permian Basin was recorded at 19,000 barrels, considerably lower than 163,000 barrels from Eagle Ford.Headquartered in Houston, TX, ConocoPhillips has rallied 50.5% over the past year, outperforming the industry’s 36.3% gain. The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked players in the energy sector are BP plc (BP  -  Free Report), WildHorse Resource Development Corporation (WRD  -  Free Report) and W&T Offshore, Inc. (WTI  -  Free Report). BP and WildHorse sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), while W&T Offshore carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. BP managed to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four quarters.WildHorse is expected to see year-over-year earnings growth of 288.4% in 2018.W&T Offshore will likely witness earnings growth of 7.1% in 2018.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?

1410,COP,"ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report) is trying to gain control of Venezuela’s key offshore operations in the Caribbean in order to recover $2 billion from a decade-old row with the nation, per the sources.ConocoPhillips has requested a court in the Dutch Antilles for control of facilities run by Venezuela's state-run oil firm PDVSA. Notably, PDVSA largely depends on facilities in the islands of Curacao, Bonaire and St. Eustatius. These facilities are used for the processing and storing of Venezuela's heavy crude before dispatching it to the three major global markets – the United States, China and India.Once an oil-rich country, Venezuela is now embroiled in political and economic issues for nearly two decades under a socialist leadership. In late April, an arbitration panel instituted under the International Chamber of Commerce found that Venezuela under the leadership of then-President Hugo Chavez had unlawfully seized investments from joint venture operations with ConocoPhillips. Thus, the company sought compensation at a local court for the fraudulent behavior. The demand made in the petition has not been made public. The $2-billion award corresponds to more than 20% of the cash-strapped government's foreign currency reserves.The facilities on two of the islands are leased by PVDSA. Thus, ConocoPhillips cannot take control over them, even with a court order. However, it could seize Venezuela's oil stored in them and any state-owned ships that dock there, per experts.Over the weekend, the oil tankers that left Venezuela's shores turned around before reaching the Caribbean islands. The storage facilities on two of the islands have the capacity to store crude valued $900 million, about 50% of Venezuela's monthly production.Per Reuters, ConocoPhillips’ action could impact PDVSA's exports of about 400,000 barrels per day from the Caribbean, or about a third of its total exports.These legal actions will deal a big blow to PDVSA’s already waning oil revenues and in turn Venezuela's economy, which is in deep recession with widespread shortage of medicine and food.Price PerformanceDuring the past three months, ConocoPhillips’ shares gained 25.4% compared with the industry’s 12.1% rally. Zacks Rank & Key PicksConocoPhillips currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked players in the same sector are Nine Energy Service, Inc (NINE  -  Free Report), BP plc (BP  -  Free Report) and Solaris Oilfield Infrastructure, Inc.

1411,COP,"BP plc (BP  -  Free Report) has inked a binding gas sales precedent agreement with the state of Alaska. Per the terms, the company committed to sell gas to Alaska's gas line project.Alaska's gas line project is an initiative by the Alaska Gas Development Corporation (“AGDC”) to meet higher gas demand projected in 2025. The success of the initiative depends on the support it gets from Alaska's major natural gas producers. Though the producers have shown interest in the project, BP is the first to sign such a commitment.Per reports, the agency has finalized key terms for gas sales of pricing and volume with BP. However, details of these parameters were not disclosed. Therefore, the viability of the project cannot be determined.BP has committed to sell its share of 30 trillion cubic feet of gas from the Prudhoe Bay and Point Thomson units. BP, the operator of Prudhoe Bay field, has an interest of 26%. It also owns 32% share in the nearby Point Thomson field. Through leases with the state, the company controls about 33% of the huge volumes of gas intended for the project.However, other owners of the Prudhoe Bay — ExxonMobil Corporation (XOM  -  Free Report) and ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report) — are also required to agree to sell their share of the gas to the project for its success. The agency will need gas supply agreements with all of the North Slope producers for the project to run at full capacity.After receiving commitments from these oil giants, the financing of the project would become easier. The project is being evaluated by several China-owned companies for potential long-term investment. China is Alaska’s largest trading partner and projected consumer of natural gas.The Alaska project will super-chill North Slope gas into liquefied natural gas or LNG and ship it by oceangoing tanker to Asian utilities. The project is not estimated to yield its first gas before 2023.Price PerformanceDuring the past three months, BP’s shares have gained 15.6% compared with the industry’s 12.2% rally. Zacks Rank & Key PicksBP currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked player in the same sector is Delek US Holdings, Inc (DK  -  Free Report), sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

1412,COP,"Domestic oil and gas explorer Whiting Petroleum Corporation (WLL  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report its first-quarter earnings on Monday, Apr 30, after market close. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is a profit of 22 cents on revenues of $473.2 million.In the preceding three-month period, the company beat the consensus mark by 46.9% on robust output and prices.As far as earnings surprises are concerned, the Denver, CO-based upstream operator is on a firm footing, having gone past the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four reports. This is depicted in the graph below:Whiting Petroleum Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Whiting Petroleum Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Whiting Petroleum Corporation QuoteInvestors are keeping their fingers crossed and hoping that Whiting Petroleum surpasses earnings estimate this time too. Let’s delve deeper and find out the factors impacting the results.Factors to Consider This QuarterWe believe that the improving oil price environment and strong production bode well for the company’s upcoming report.Management had earlier guided first-quarter total production in the band of 11.1-11.6 million barrels of oil equivalent (MMBOE) – primarily from the Williston Basin. We note that the current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarterly output is 11.40 MMBOE, at the midpoint of the company’s forecast range and above the 10.56 MMBOE reported in the year-ago quarter.Meanwhile, analysts polled by Zacks expect average realized oil price to rise 25.2% from the year-ago quarter to $55 per barrel.However, Whiting Petroleum’s per unit depreciation, depletion, and amortization costs remain on the higher side and could push up the company’s breakeven point. This might affect the Whiting Petroleum’s bottom line in the first quarter of 2018.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Whiting Petroleum will beat estimates this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat consensus estimates. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is -12.95%.Zacks Rank: Whiting Petroleum is #3 Ranked. Though a Zacks Rank of 3 increases the predictive power of ESP, a negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Ranks #4 and 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderWhile earnings beat looks uncertain for Whiting Petroleum, here are some energy companies you may want to consider on the basis of our model, which shows that they have the right combination of elements to post earnings beat this quarter:EOG Resources, Inc. (EOG  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +12.50% and a Zacks Rank #1. The firm is expected to release earnings on May 3.

1413,COP,"ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 earnings on Apr 26, before the opening bell.    In the last reported quarter, the upstream energy company posted an earnings surprise of 0.00%. ConocoPhillips has an average positive earnings surprise of 144.45% for the last four quarters. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to the announcement.  Which Way Are Estimates Treading?Let’s look at the estimate revision trend in order to get a clear picture of what analysts expect from the company this earnings season.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter earnings of 73 cents has seen two upward revisions and one downward revision by firms in the last 60 days. It reflects a whopping improvement of about 3,750% from the year-ago quarter.Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $8,527 million for the first quarter, up 9.7% from the year-ago quarter.Factors to ConsiderThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for average sale price of natural gas is $5.04 per thousand cubic feet (Mcf), higher than last quarter’s $4.59 per Mcf and the year-ago quarter’s $3.84 per Mcf.The average sales price of natural gas liquids for the first quarter is estimated at $34.16 per barrel, higher than last quarter’s reported price of $32.79 per barrel and $24.87 per barrel in the year-ago quarter. Moreover, production is expected to rise to 92 thousand barrel per day (MBD) from fourth quarter’s 89 MBD.Average crude oil sales price is expected at $60 per barrel, higher than fourth quarter’s $59 a barrel and the year-ago quarter’s $51. Moreover, production of crude oil per day for the first quarter is expected to rise to 609 MBD from the year-ago quarter’s 601 MBD.Higher expectations for prices of natural gas, natural gas liquid and crude oil will likely favor the company’s first-quarter earnings.Price Performance in Q1During the quarter, ConocoPhillips has outperformed its industry, with the stock rallying 8% against the industry's decline of 1.4%.  Earnings WhispersOur proven model shows that ConocoPhillips is likely to beat earnings this time because it has the right combination of two key ingredients. Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is +3.23%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate of 76 cents is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 73 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: ConocoPhillips carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings. The combination of ConocoPhillips’ favorable Zacks Rank and Earnings ESP makes us confident about an earnings beat.Conversely, Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few other firms that you may want to consider on the basis of our model. These have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Comstock Resources, Inc. (CRK  -  Free Report) is an oil and gas explorer. The company has an Earnings ESP of +37.34% and a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Oil States International, Inc.

1415,COP,"Major oilfield service provider Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report its first-quarter 2018 results on Monday, Apr 23, before market opens. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is a profit of 41 cents on revenues of $5,760 million.In the preceding three-month period, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 15.2% thanks to improved utilization and pricing gains in North America -- the company’s largest market by sales.On a further encouraging note, the world's second-largest oilfield services company after Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB  -  Free Report) has an incredible history when it comes to beating earnings estimates. Investors should note that Halliburton hasn’t missed earnings estimates since mid-2014, as you can see in the chart below:Halliburton Company Price and EPS Surprise Halliburton Company Price and EPS Surprise | Halliburton Company QuoteEven pricewise, the stock has done better than the peer group so far this year; it is up 4.5% in 2018 as against 0.2% loss for the Zacks Oil and Gas Field Services industry. Investors are keeping their fingers crossed and hoping that Houston, TX-based provider of technical products and services to drillers of oil and gas wells surpasses earnings estimate this time too.Unfortunately, as per our model, the trend is likely to be broken in the first quarter. Evidently, multiple headwinds including fracking sand logistics issues have dampened expectations.Thus, while U.S. activity continues to accelerate and margins remain strong, Halliburton’s underlying results are unlikely to come ahead of our expectations. The tepid sentiment surrounding the stock can be gauged from the fact that the estimate revision trend has been negative with four downward estimate revisions and none up in the last month.Let’s delve deep to find out the factors likely to impact Halliburton’s third-quarter results.Factors to Consider This QuarterWith U.S. rig count falling to record levels in 2016, oilfield services players (like Halliburton) were hit hard. Unprecedented declines in activity levels and a sharp fall in upstream spending led to lower revenues and pricing headwinds. However, as commodity prices steadily improve and drilling activities pick up, the market for services companies is on the mend.The U.S. oil benchmark wrapped up a strong quarter amid continued declines in domestic inventories and an improving supply-demand narrative. With fundamentals pointing to a tighter market, the first quarter of the year saw U.S. oil benchmark attain its highest settlement since December 2014.Consequently, spending on exploration projects have experienced a much-awaited rebound. The energy explorers, buoyed by the jump in commodity prices, are set for improving sales and earnings – a part of which is likely to be pocketed by the oilfield service providers. In particular, the North American land market is improving rapidly, driven by increased utilization and pricing -- particularly for pressure pumping.As a proof of the resurgence in activities, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter Completion and Production revenue is pegged at $3,822 million, higher than $3,804 million reported in the previous quarter and way above the first-quarter 2017 sales of $2,604 million. To put things in perspective, the Completion and Production unit makes up around two-thirds of the oilfield service provider’s total revenue and operating income.However, cost inflation triggered by increased fracking sand pricing is likely to drag down the company's bottom line. Rising prices of sand – used to hydraulically fracture new wells – increases the expense associated with the drilling of a new shale well and puts upward pressure on the cost of contractors like Halliburton.As it is, Halliburton had to shell out more to purchase the sand from spot markets to minimize the impact on client completion timelines after extreme weather and rail shut-downs disrupted deliveries.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Halliburton will beat estimates this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat consensus estimates. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is -3.42%.Zacks Rank: Halliburton is #3 Ranked. Though a Zacks Rank of 3 increases the predictive power of ESP, a negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult. We caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Ranks #4 and 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderWhile earnings beat looks uncertain for Halliburton, here are some energy companies you may want to consider on the basis of our model, which shows that they have the right combination of elements to post earnings beat this quarter:ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +3.33% and a Zacks Rank #3. The firm is expected to release earnings on Apr 26.

1416,COP,"After having witnessed extreme volatility in terms of pricing over the last three years, the commodity market has gradually recovered from its historic lows, to comfortably trade at more than $60 a barrel since the start of this year.In fact, the first quarter of the year saw the U.S. oil benchmark attain its highest settlement since December 2014 despite record high domestic production. Crude was supported by various catalysts, including strong demand and continued production curb from OPEC and its allies. Needless to say, such favorable developments have buoyed investors’ optimism surrounding the sector’s first-quarter results.Q1 Progress Report: What’s Going in Favor?Per EIA data, the commodity rose about 7.5% in the first three months of 2018 to finish the quarter at $64.87 per barrel. It goes without saying that all oil-related stocks are thus poised to benefit from recovering commodity prices as they will be able to extract more value for their products.One of the main reasons why the U.S. oil benchmark soared revolved around expectations that OPEC and other major producers agreed to expand their output-cut deal beyond March. The coalition prolonged the agreement for another nine months to the end of 2018 in an attempt to clear the supply gut.Another major factor fueling higher oil prices is fast-growing demand for the commodity, which continues to tighten the market. Per the International Energy Agency (IEA), global oil demand is likely to grow by 1.5 million barrels a day this year to average 99.3 million barrels a day.Sharp inventory drawdowns have also led to the commodity tread on growth trajectory. Oil stockpiles have shrunk in 36 of the last 51 weeks and are down more than 100 million barrels since April last year. The gradual fall – stemming from a combination of lower imports and spiraling exports – has helped the U.S. crude market shift from year-over-year storage surplus to a deficit. At 429.9 million barrels, current crude supplies are 20% below the year-ago period.ConcernsWhile there is renewed optimism among U.S. oil companies amid the $65-plus WTI prices, the positivism could be undermined by soaring U.S. production. Volume from U.S. oil fields (inclusive of shale) has risen 25% since mid-2016 to more than 10.5 million barrels per day — the highest since the EIA started maintaining weekly data in 1983. In early February, oil production broke through the 10-million-barrels-a-day threshold for the first time in nearly 50 years and has maintained the record levels thereafter.A rise in the oil drilling rig count points to a further increase in domestic output. An early gauge of future activity, rigs drilling for oil in America totaled 1,003 in the week to Apr 6, as per the latest weekly report by Baker Hughes, a GE Company.Nevertheless, while we do not rule out chances for short-term pullbacks on oversupply concerns, we remain extremely confident of an extended period of gains in the near future.The Picture So FarWith the Q1 earnings season finally kicking off, 24 S&P 500 participants released their financial numbers as of Apr 11. Per the latest Earnings Trends, the results reflect a positive trend, with an above-average proportion of companies beating top- and bottom-line expectations. Overall earnings, for the companies that have already reported, are up 39.3% from the year-ago period on 11.7% higher revenues. The beat ratio for the bottom line was 75% while that for the top line was 70.8%.The strong momentum we saw in the preceding earnings season is expected to continue in this reporting cycle, with total earnings for the S&P 500 index expected to be up 16 % from the same period last year on 7.4% higher revenues. This would follow 13.4% earnings growth on 8.6% revenue growth in the 2017 Q4 earnings season, the best quarterly performance in more than six years.Encouraging Numbers From Energy SpaceThe Oil/Energy sector put up a stellar show in the October-December 2017 period. Earnings for the sector recorded a massive 136.3% jump from the year-ago period — the highest among the 16 broad Zacks sectors — on 23.6% higher revenues.The Q1 earnings season for the Energy sector is just around the corner. Investors are eagerly awaiting the flow of results, starting Apr 20, when Schlumberger Limited (SLB) reports first and foremost from the S&P energy cohort.In fact, the Energy sector is poised to witness the highest growth in Q1 yet again. The Earnings Trends report shows that earnings for the sector are expected to be up 60.1% from the year-ago quarter, while the top line is likely to register 16.1% growth.Picking the Prospective Winners for the SeasonThe encouraging figures suggest that there are a number of companies which are likely to trump first-quarter estimates.However, with a wide range of energy firms thronging the investment space, it is by no means an easy task for investors to arrive at stocks that have the potential to deliver better-than-expected earnings.While it is impossible to be sure about such outperformers, our proprietary methodology - Earnings ESP - makes it relatively simple.

1417,COP,"U.S. stock markets surged in the first trading day of the week driven by robust first-quarter 2018 earnings results and easing of geopolitical tensions at least for the time being. Monday’s positive market movements were broad-based as all the major indexes closed in the green.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) closed at 24,573.04, gaining 0.9% or 212.9 points. The S&P 500 Index (INX) increased 0.8% to close at 2,677.84. The Nasdaq Composite Index (IXIC) closed at 7,156.28, increasing 0.7%. A total of 5.74 billion shares were traded on Monday, higher than the last 20-session average of 7.03 billion shares. Advancers outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 2.7-to-1 ratio. On the Nasdaq, advancers had an edge over decliners by 1.82 to-1 ratio. The CBOE VIX declined 4.9% and closed at 16.56.How Did the Benchmarks Perform?The Dow gained 0.9% with 25 stocks of the 30-stock index closing in the green while five stocks traded in the red. Notably, the blue-chip index closed above its 50-day moving average. Dow breached this psychological barrier for the first time since Mar 13 and closed above it for the first time since Mar 9 indicating positive investor sentiment.S&P 500 increased 0.8% led by 1.4% gain of the Utilities Select Sector SPDR (XLU) and 1.3% increase of the Materials Select Sector SPDR (XLB).

Total earnings of the S&P 500 index is expected to be up 16.6% from the same period last year backed by 7.5% year-over-year growth in revenues.

1418,COP,"ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report) has wrapped up its 2018 winter exploration and appraisal program in Alaska. The outcome of the program holds promise and the company intends to expand its track record of operational success and value creation in Alaska.Initially, ConocoPhillips had planned to drill five wells on the Western North Slope. This included two appraisal wells of the Willow Discovery announced in January 2017 and three exploration wells. But the company drilled a total of six wells, including an additional Willow appraisal well. This was possible due to improved drilling efficiencies. All the six wells as well as a sidetrack encountered oil and confirmed the potential of the play.The three Willow appraisal wells hold a recoverable resource potential of about 300 million barrels of oil, per previous estimates. These exploration wells signify new discoveries for the company and increase the scope for further operations in the Western North Slope.Additionally, five production flow tests were carried out as part of the exploration program. The outcome from these tests raises optimism.Data collected from the operations will be evaluated for another active exploration and appraisal season in 2019.ConocoPhillips is one of the largest exploration and production players in the world, considering proved reserves and production parameters. The company is a major global exploration and production company with operations and activities in 17 countries that include the United States, Canada, Columbia, Chile, the U.K./Norway, China, Australia, offshore Timor-Leste, Indonesia, Malaysia, Brunei, Libya and Qatar.Price PerformanceConocoPhillips’ shares have gained 9.8% in the last three months, versus the industry’s 0.3% decline. Zacks Rank & Key PicksConocoPhillips carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked players in the same sector are Continental Resources, Inc (CLR  -  Free Report), Northern Oil and Gas Inc (NOG  -  Free Report) and SunCoke Energy Inc (SXC  -  Free Report). All three stocks sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

1419,COP,"ExxonMobil Corporation (XOM  -  Free Report) has been accused by New York-based prosecutor, Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, for deceiving investors in relation to climate change risks. These accusations indicated at a fraud and the company was asked to present more documents.Schneiderman’s filing followed a day after President Trump announced plans to pull out of the Paris climate accord. Per the accord, about 200 countries vowed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to slow global warming. The President’s decision was condemned by several world leaders and many U.S. executives.How Investors Were MisleadEric Schneiderman is believed to hold evidence against ExxonMobil that can prove that the company had been presenting false and misleading statements. This could have led investors to think that ExxonMobil had accurately evaluated the risks. However, the company is likely to have overlooked a formula to estimate the impact of future environmental regulation on new deals.In his filings, Schneiderman focused on the method used by ExxonMobil to present investors with estimates of the regulatory cost of greenhouse gas emissions on new projects. The company often presented a number it called a “proxy cost” for greenhouse gases. Through this, the company tried to account for prospective changes to government policy that will make the production and consumption of fossil fuels more costly.Per Schneiderman, this whole accounting may be a fraud as the company might not have used it when calculating profits and losses on investments. This can again be verified by examining ExxonMobil’s documents of oil sands project, which indicates profit over the course of the project’s original timeline. The case would have been separate, if ExxonMobil applied the proxy cost it promised to shareholders. Per the attorney general, at least one significant oil sand project might have projected a financial loss.Along with Schneiderman’s reports, ExxonMobil’s climate-related statements to investors are also being examined by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on how it values its oil and gas reserves amid low prices as well as potential restrain on carbon emissions.However, the company has denied such allegations and stated that its external statements have correctly presented the use of a proxy cost of carbon. Also, the documents forwarded to the attorney general make this fact apparent. The company will present more documents to support court filings.Transparency IssueRecently, ExxonMobil has been actively involved in implementing climate change policies, thanks to tremendous pressure from investors and environmentalists. The primary objectives include the restriction of greenhouse gas emissions, reduction in global warming, appointment of a climate expert on the board, reports on fracking activities and climate change impact assessments.As a result, the company has increased climate-related disclosures. These disclosures include affirmation of the company’s pledge to the Paris climate agreement, inclusion of an environmental expert to its board and the reduction of emission from its operations. However, ExxonMobil is avoiding shareholders’ request for additional information regarding the impact of climate change in its operations.However, the company has been struggling with Schneiderman’s requests for information about its climate change policies in state and federal court. ExxonMobil argues that it is not liable to produce records because the New York-based prosecutor’s probe is politically provoked and is an insult.The opposition by ExxonMobil has led to a strange situation. Usually, State and federal prosecutors only disclose their findings once they have concluded the process and are ready to file charges.ExxonMobil sued Schneiderman and Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey, who is also questioning the company in federal court. Moreover, the company’s effort to challenge Schneiderman’s subpoenas has led the prosecutor to forward the proofs to fight his case on why ExxonMobil should be forced to provide more documents.As part of the inquiry, ExxonMobil has already submitted 2 million documents. These documents have revealed that Rex Tillerson, who until December was chief executive of ExxonMobil, used a separate email address under a different name — Wayne Tracker — to talk about climate change-related issues while at the company.Schneiderman is searching more documents, that haven’t been forwarded by ExxonMobil. He is trying to interrogate employees who might know about the company’s internal climate change plans. How ExxonMobil Plans to Fight Climate ChangeExxonMobil has launched a plan to slash methane emissions from its onshore assets in the United States. The company plans to replace old equipments with updated technology. It has already invested about $8 billion on energy efficiency and low-emission technologies such as carbon capture and next-generation biofuels.ExxonMobil will focus on employee training to reduce emissions. The company plans to study the use of satellites, drones and other relevant equipment in controlling future leakages. The company's ally, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, may help with drones for detecting methane.Other Lawsuits Filed on Climate Change IssuesIn September 2017, two major Californian cities — San Francisco and Oakland — filed lawsuits against five oil and energy super majors. The cities had taken legal action against Chevron Corp. (CVX  -  Free Report) , ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report) , Royal Dutch Shell plc (RDS.A  -  Free Report) , ExxonMobil and BP plc  — all Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) companies. All the stocks sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.ExxonMobil’s case is among several, which include lawsuits by shareholders and employees, centered on whether it has for decades misled people about climate change. This includes the impact of climate change on energy prices and the environment as well as the company’s ability to develop reserves.Notably, many such lawsuits have been filed in the past which did not bear results. In 2009, Kivalina, AK, filed charges against many oil companies which got dismissed in the court and repealed by the Clean Air Act and the Environmental Protection Agency.In 2011, the Supreme Court of U.S. overruled the public nuisance claims of eight states and the New York City against electric utility companies. In July 2017, similar litigation cases were filed by two coastal counties of California — Marin and San Mateo — against oil majors like Chevron, BP, Shell and ExxonMobil among others for rising sea levels. The charges claimed that the companies were responsible for emitting about 20% of greenhouse gases between 1965 and 2015.The verdict is pending and there are chances that this case might fail given the complex nature of legal requirements.Bottom LineOf late, ExxonMobil’s argument was dismissed by the U.S. District Judge Valerie Caproni in Manhattan as “implausible”. Also, Schneiderman and Healey were said to be pursuing politically motivated as well as fraud investigations with the intention of breaching its constitutional rights. Even the Massachusetts Supreme Court rejected ExxonMobil’s appeal to block the state’s attorney general from obtaining records to examine whether the company had hidden its knowledge of the role of fossil fuels in climate change for decades.Caproni discharged the lawsuit with prejudice, meaning the Irving, Texas-based company cannot bring it again.This is a major turning point, which is likely to result in ExxonMobil being prosecuted for misleading investors. Moreover, the documents produced by the company and evidences shown by Schneiderman are against the company.Investor Alert: Breakthroughs PendingA medical advance is now at the flashpoint between theory and realization. Billions of dollars in research have poured into it. Companies are already generating substantial revenue, and even more wondrous products are in the pipeline.Cures for a variety of deadly diseases are in sight, and so are big potential profits for early investors.

1421,COP,"The U.S. Energy Department's inventory release showed that crude stockpiles recorded a big weekly build as domestic oil production reached another all-time high.Middle East Tensions Overshadow EIA DataHowever, oil traders chose to overlook bearish trends from the EIA data set and were more concerned about the uncertainty surrounding mounting tensions in the Middle East and the resultant fears of supplies being disrupted. The commodity settled at a three-year high of $66.82 per barrel yesterday after President Trump hinted at the possibility of a military strike against Syria, and Saudi Arabia claimed to have intercepted missiles fired by Yemeni rebels.Analysis of the EIA DataCrude Oil: The federal government’s EIA report revealed that crude inventories rose by 3.3 million barrels for the week ending Apr 6, following a decrease of 4.6 million barrels in the previous week. The analysts surveyed by S&P Global Platts – the leading independent commodities and energy data provider – had expected crude stocks to go up some 100,000 barrels.Record-high domestic production and surging imports led to the larger-than-expected build with the world's biggest oil consumer even as refiner demand strengthened.In particular, U.S. output rose by 65,000 barrels per day last week to more than 10.5 million barrels per day – the most since the EIA started maintaining weekly data in 1983. In early February, oil production broke through the 10 million barrels a day threshold for the first time in nearly 50 years and has maintained the record levels thereafter.While oil inventories rose last week, stockpiles have actually shrunk in 37 of the last 53 weeks and are down nearly 105 million barrels in the past year. The gradual fall has helped the U.S. crude market shift from year-over-year storage surplus to a deficit. At 428.6 million barrels, current crude supplies are 20% below the year-ago period and are in the bottom half of the average range during this time of the year.Meanwhile, stocks at the Cushing terminal in Oklahoma – the key delivery hub for U.S. crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange – was up by 1.1 million barrels to 36 million barrels.At 25.4 days, the crude supply cover was unchanged from the previous week. In the year-ago period, the supply cover was 32.7 days.Gasoline: Gasoline supplies recorded their first increase in six weeks as production edged up. The 458,000 barrels build – contrary to the polled number of 2 million barrels fall in supply level – took gasoline stockpiles up to 238.9 million barrels. Despite last week’s rise, the stock of the most widely used petroleum product remains just below the year-earlier level though it is in the top half of the average range.Distillate: Distillate fuel supplies (including diesel and heating oil) were down 1 million barrels last week, slightly lower than analysts’ expectations for 1.2 million barrels decrease in supply level.

1422,COP,"The U.S. Energy Department's inventory release showed that crude stockpiles recorded a surprise weekly decline even as domestic oil production reached another all-time high. Following the data sets, front month West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures moved down 0.2% (or 14 cents) to end at $63.37 per barrel yesterday.Analysis of the EIA DataCrude Oil: The federal government’s EIA report revealed that crude inventories fell by 4.6 million barrels for the week ending Mar 30, following an increase of 1.6 million barrels in the previous week. The analysts surveyed by S&P Global Platts – the leading independent commodities and energy data provider – had expected crude stocks to go up some one million barrels.Higher refinery runs and lower imports led to the surprise draw build with the world's biggest oil consumer even as domestic production reached a new record.In particular, U.S. output rose by 27,000 barrels per day last week to nearly 10.5 million barrels per day – the most since the EIA started maintaining weekly data in 1983. In early February, oil production broke through the 10 million barrels a day threshold for the first time in nearly 50 years and has maintained the record levels thereafter.Meanwhile, stockpiles have shrunk in 37 of the last 52 weeks and are down more than 108 million barrels since April last year. The gradual fall has helped the U.S. crude market shift from year-over-year storage surplus to a deficit. At 425.3 million barrels, current crude supplies are 20.6% below the year-ago period and are in the bottom half of the average range during this time of the year.However, stocks at the Cushing terminal in Oklahoma – the key delivery hub for U.S. crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange – was up by 3.7 million barrels to 34.9 million barrels.The crude supply cover was down from 26.1 days in the previous week to 25.4 days. In the year-ago period, the supply cover was 33.5 days.Gasoline: Gasoline supplies recorded their fifth weekly decrease in a row as production slipped. The 1.1 million barrels drawn – below the polled number of 1.9 million barrels fall in supply level – took gasoline stockpiles down to 238.5 million barrels. Following last week’s decline, the stock of the most widely used petroleum product remains just below the year-earlier level though it is in the top half of the average range.Distillate: Distillate fuel supplies (including diesel and heating oil) edged up 537,000 barrels last week, contrary to analysts’ expectations for 1.3 million barrels decrease in supply level. The small weekly rise could be attributed to higher production and weak demand. At 129.5 million barrels, current supplies are 15% below the year-ago level and are in the lower half of the average range for this time of the year.Refinery Rates: Refinery utilization was up by 0.7% from the prior week to 93%.About the Weekly Petroleum Status ReportThe Energy Information Administration (EIA) Petroleum Status Report, containing data of the previous week ending Friday, outlines information regarding the weekly change in petroleum inventories held and produced by the U.S., both locally and abroad.The report provides an overview of the level of reserves and their movements, thereby helping investors understand the demand/supply dynamics of petroleum products.

1423,COP,"WPX Energy Inc. (WPX  -  Free Report) announced a cash tender offer to purchase up to $500 million aggregate principal amount of its outstanding 7.500%, 6.000% and 8.250% Senior Notes due 2020, 2022 and 2023, respectively.  The objective of the company is to further strengthen its balance sheet and lower interest expenses.The announcement of the tender offer does not come as a surprise since WPX Energy has already announced that it will utilize a major portion of the $700 million sell proceeds of its San Juan Basin assets for lowering its existing debts and further strengthen balance sheet. (Read more: WPX Energy Exits San Juan, Focuses on Delaware & Williston)The successful completion of the offer will further lower its Total Debt to Total Capital that presently stands at 38.42%, which is currently higher than its industry average of 35.1%.WPX Energy’s Oil FocusWPX Energy has transformed itself from a natural gas focused company to an oil-focused one. The company has been able to do so through nearly $8 billion of transactions.At present, nearly 80% production of the company is oil and the rest natural gas. It was simply the opposite five years ago. This transformation is a result of execution of the company’s plan to produce more liquids.The strategy gels well with the ongoing recovery of oil prices. The recent report from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (“EIA”) indicates further recovery of Brent prices from 2017 levels.  E IA forecasts that Brent spot prices will average about $62 per barrel in both 2018 and 2019 compared with an average of $54 per barrel in 2017.Higher Oil ProductionThe improvement in oil prices also bring in higher volumes of crude oil production in the United States. EIA reports indicate that U.S. crude oil production will average 10.7 million barrels per day (b/d) in 2018, which would mark the highest annual average U.S. crude oil production level.We expect the ongoing improvement in price and production of crude oil will benefit ExxonMobil (XOM  -  Free Report), Chevron Corporation (CVX  -  Free Report) and ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report), among others in the space.Price MovementIn a year’s time, shares of WPX Energy have gained 3.7%, outperforming its industry's decline of 11.8%.Zacks Rank & Key PickWPX Energy carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1424,COP,"ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report) released updates on its disposition and early life-cycle acreage acquisition activities.During the first quarter of 2018, ConocoPhillips raised proceeds of more than $250 million from the sale of non-core assets. Additionally, the company closed or entered into a definitive agreements relating to numerous small packages in the Permian Basin. The company is expected to close a package of largely unexplored acreage in South Texas during the second quarter. These transactions are not likely to dent the company’s production. The earlier announced disposition program is expected to be complete in the second quarter of 2018.In North America, the company has established or expanded positions in two early life-cycle and liquids-rich unconventional plays. In February, ConocoPhillips purchased about 245,000 net acres of early life-cycle unconventional acreage in the Lower 48 for very low entry cost. Recently, the company recognized that a large amount of the acreage is in the Austin Chalk play in central Louisiana. Beginning in 2018, ConocoPhillips projects to drill several exploration wells in the new position. This program will be funded from within the company’s announced exploration budget.Recently, ConocoPhillips obtained about 35,000 net acres in the Montney play in Canada for about $120 million. This new acreage is close to the company’s existing position in the liquids-rich portion of the Montney. With this purchase, the company’s total holding in the liquids-rich Montney play is about 140,000 net acres. The exploration and appraisal work, which is in progress for this acreage, will also be funded from the existing exploration budget.ConocoPhillips is one of the industry’s most active players in managing asset portfolio through a combination of acquisitions and disposals. With a bigger inventory of unconventional resource potential than other domestic independent, ConocoPhillips boasts a leading position among the top unconventional liquids-rich plays, comprising Eagle Ford and Permian Basin shale plays. Further, with the addition of acreage in Lower 48 and Montney play, the company’s portfolio is widened. The funds received from divestments were used to fund these purchases. These actions are in line with its strategic priorities, which are intended to boost value for its shareholders.Price PerformanceConocoPhillips’ shares have gained 3.1% in the last three months, against the industry’s 4.3% decline. Zacks Rank & Key PicksConocoPhillips carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked players in the same sector are Continental Resources, Inc (CLR  -  Free Report), Pioneer Natural Resources Company (PXD  -  Free Report) and Concho Resources Inc (CXO  -  Free Report).

1425,COP,"It was a week where oil rebounded to levels not seen since January but natural gas futures settled down further.On the news front, European supermajor Royal Dutch Shell plc (RDS.A  -  Free Report) sold its entire stake in Iraq’s West Qurna 1 oilfield to a Japanese firm for $406 million, while independent explorer Apache Corp. (APA  -  Free Report) made a significant oil discovery in the North Sea.Overall, it was another mixed week for the sector. While West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures gained around 5.6% to close at $65.88 per barrel, natural gas prices fell 3.6% to $2.591 per million Btu (MMBtu). (See the last ‘Oil & Gas Stock Roundup’ here: Shell Quits New Zealand, Statoil to Become Equinor)The U.S. oil benchmark jumped above the psychologically important $65 per barrel level last week following the release of EIA crude inventory numbers, renewed geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and Fed announcement on interest rates.The federal government’s EIA report revealed that crude inventories fell by 2.6 million barrels for the week ending Mar 16. Stockpiles have shrunk in 36 of the last 50 weeks and are down more than 105 million barrels since April last year. The gradual fall has helped the U.S. crude market shift from year-over-year storage surplus to a deficit. At 428.3 million barrels, current crude supplies are 19.7% below the year-ago period and are in the bottom half of the average range during this time of the year.Apart from the bullish government data, oil prices were also supported by growing concerns over tensions between major crude producers Iran and Saudi Arabia. There is widespread speculation that Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's ongoing state visit to Washington is aimed at ramping up pressure to reimpose sanctions on Iran. Fast falling production in Venezuela have added to the jitters.Finally, oil prices were also supported by the Federal Reserve’s decision to raise interest rates. As widely expected, the U.S. central bank opted to hike the benchmark lending rate a quarter-point to between 1.5% and 1.75%. This led to dollar weakness that made the greenback-priced crude more affordable for investors holding foreign currency.Meanwhile, natural gas prices moved lower last week following a smaller-than-expected decrease in supplies. The 86 billion cubic feet (Bcf) withdrawal was also below last year’s net shrinkage of 137 Bcf for the reported week. The continued strength in production also played spoilsport.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    Royal Dutch Shell plc is set to offload its entire stake in Iraq-based West Qurna 1 oil field through a $406 million deal, moving ahead with its divestment goals. This represents the second international divestment deal that the company announced in a week after declaring its intention to exit New Zealand by selling its portfolio of energy assets in a $578 million deal.Per the latest divestment deal, the Anglo-Dutch supermajor will vend 19.6% interest in the West Qurna 1 oil field to Japan's Itochu Corp. According to the agreement, Itochu will assume a debt of $144 million. The deal has already received necessary regulatory approvals and is scheduled for completion within a next few days.The move will help Shell proceed with its $30-billion divestment program. The deal provides the company with a major uplift in its drive to decrease debt following the acquisition of BG Group for $47 billion. The divestment is expected to reduce the company’s cost and enhance cash flow as well as return to capital.2.    Apache Corp. recently announced that it has made an oil discovery at its Garten prospect on Block 9/18a Area-W of the North Sea. The significant finding falls in the United Kingdom sector, near the Beryl Alpha Platform, where the independent energy company is focused for future potential.The Garten prospect encountered more than 700 feet of net oil pay in its reservoirs. Per the company, the recoverable resource from the prospect can surpass 10 million barrels of light oil - at the upper-end mark of its pre-drill measures. Apache owns a 100% working interest in the prospect. The new find is the 2500th exploration well off the coast in the UK Continental Shelf. Apache has used modern data and technologies to discover new possibilities in the area, per its latest efforts to improve capital efficiency.Notably, the latest discovery is Apache's fourth commercial find in the Beryl region in the preceding three years. The well, located 6 kilometers south of the Beryl Alpha platform, will be tied back to the facility. This is in line with the company’s strategy of focusing on exploration near its already operated fields to avoid the long cycle time of large-scale projects. Apache is working with the U.K. Oil and Gas Authority for achieving regulatory approvals of production in the Garten prospect, which is expected in 2019's first quarter.

Last month, Midstates Petroleum had made the proposal to merge with SandRidge after the latter dropped its plan to acquire Colorado-based Bonanza, Creek Energy, Inc. following intense opposition from its shareholders.Had the deal been finalized, it surely would have improved the scale and value for both the players by creating one of the largest entities in the Mississippian Lime shale formation, as both the companies have a strong presence in the region. However, the merger would entail a significant risk as Mississippi Lime requires much higher commodity prices to prove highly productive.The company is skeptical about Midstates’ reserves, and the economic feasibility of drilling locations at current oil and gas prices. Further, SandRidge believes that the merger is not likely to unlock substantial synergies unless the company employs Midstates’ assets with high operational efficiency. As such, SandRidge does not support Midstates’ estimate that the merger would result in free cash flows of $320-$400 million over the next four years. The company thus views the collaboration as highly dilutive and not in the best interests of shareholders.

(PTR  -  Free Report) recently received stakes in two offshore oil concessions from the national oil company of UAE, Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (""ADNOC""), for a total consideration of $1.18 billion.

While operator ADNOC retains the majority shares (60%) in both the concessions, other oil companies are also present in the projects.Crude production capacity from the Umm Shaif field combined with the Nasr field is 460,000 barrels per day. ADNOC intends to reduce Abu Dhabi’s dependency on imported gas by processing 500 million standard cubic feet of gas per day from the Umm Shaif for the rising domestic energy demand.(Read more PetroChina Buys Oil Stakes in UAE for $1.18 Billion)5.    BP p.l.c.

1427,COP,"Enbridge Inc. (ENB  -  Free Report) recently cleared a significant regulatory hurdle of final environmental review for its proposed Line 3 crude pipeline project in northern Minnesota. The project has received unanimous approval from the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission. The project's fate now awaits an administrative law judge's report on its importance, which is expected to be released on Apr 23, 2018.Regulators: Line 3 Project is “adequate” The regulatory board is of the opinion that the project meets all legal requirements, after it considered the proposed alternatives for the pipeline's route. Through the project, which was highly opposed by the environmentalists, the company is planning to replace the aging Line 3 crude oil pipeline.The old pipeline was built in the 1960s and ships crude to Enbridge's terminal in Superior, WI from Alberta through North Dakota and Minnesota. The company, with the use of strong steel, is likely to restore the pipeline's original shipping capacity of 760,000 barrels per day (BPD), which has come down to 390,000 BPD. The company's proposition incorporates replacing the old pipeline's 282-mile stretch in Minnesota with a new alternate routed pipeline of 337 miles that goes through the pristine Mississippi River headwaters area. It is also expected to make the shipping to Midwest refineries more reliable.Meanwhile the public opinion on the pipeline remains divided. The Minnesota locals have welcomed the replacement to ensure better environmental security and the creation of 8,600 jobs. The total economic impact of the project on the state is expected to be around $2 billion. On the other hand, it contradicts with the interests of the Ojibwe groups, who fear that a spill in their lake can disrupt food sources as it can contaminate the area where they gather wild rice.Enbridge’s View Calgary, Alberta-based Enbridge’s take on the project answers many questions regarding the environmental impact of the pipeline.  As it is, the pipeline, being quite old, needs frequent maintenance. Moreover, the pipeline’s currently curtailed capacity forces oil shippers from Alberta oil sands to carry the additional crude by rail or road, both less efficient than the pipeline. Enbridge believes, the approval of the replacement project will help the refineries in Minnesota and the regional oil market. Moreover, the company expects that the jobs created through the project and following its completion will be important for the state's economy.The capital cost of the project in Canada is estimated to be C$5.3 billion while the portion in the United States will cost $2.9 billion. The pipeline will transport light, medium and heavy crude oil.Price Performance Enbridge has lost 24.7% last year against 12.2% growth of its industry. Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderEnbridge carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the oil and energy sector are Pioneer Natural Resources Company (PXD  -  Free Report), Continental Resources, Inc.

1428,COP,"W&T Offshore, Inc. (WTI  -  Free Report), on Mar 20, was upgraded to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Why the Upgrade?The company has recently released some positive news that is bound to help the company in the long run. On Mar 12, 2018, the company signed a joint exploration and development deal with an investor group, which will enable the company to drill 14 projects in the prolific Gulf of Mexico for more than three years. Initially, W&T Offshore will receive 30% of the net revenues from the project, which can later increase to 38.4%. The deal is expected to help the company develop its high-return inventory.Additionally, W&T Offshore successfully bid on an interest in three blocks in the Gulf of Mexico’s Heidelberg field. The bid by the company covers Cobalt International Energy’s entire interest in the field, which has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Cobalt's production in February 2018 from the assets was approximately 3,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. W&T Offshore bid $31.1 million cash for the interest as the quality of the assets satisfies the company’s acquisition criteria.Moreover, the leading oil and gas explorer has an impressive earnings surprise history, the average positive earnings surprise being 542.8% in the trailing four quarters.W&T Offshore’s total proved oil equivalent reserves – as of Dec 31, 2017 – was 74.2 million barrels, marginally higher than 2016.W&T Offshore has set a capital budget of $130 million for 2018 that will be spent for the oil-rich projects. The decision seems impressive given that the company has a trailing 12-month return on capital investment of 21.7%, significantly higher than 2% of the industry it belongs to. Also, the Houston, TX-based upstream energy firm has gained 39.7% in the last year against the industry’s 12.4% decline.  Other Stocks to ConsiderOther top-ranked stocks in the oil and energy sector are Pioneer Natural Resources Company (PXD  -  Free Report), Continental Resources, Inc.

1429,COP,"BP p.l.c. (BP  -  Free Report), per Bloomberg, recently started the divestment process for its Egyptian mature oil fields. The move is expected to enable the company shift its focus toward the massive natural gas resources in the country.DivestmentThe British energy giant was planning to divest its Gulf of Suez assets — which employ thousands of locals — for a few months and generate around $1 billion from the oil assets. Total daily production from the assets includes 70,000 barrels of oil and 400 million cubic feet of gas. The sale is in line with the company's strategy to divest $2-$3 billion worth of assets through 2018, which is much lower than $4.3 billion the company received from divestment and other proceeds last year.The sell-offs are helping the company reduce its overall debt burden that increased rapidly since 2009. Moreover, the oil spill incident of 2010 in the BP-operated Macondo Prospect has shaken the company to the core. Through the divestments, the company is still recovering from the oil spill. Focus on Natural GasBP is following the global trend of increasing focus on cleaner energy, natural gas. The company projects demand for gas to increase 1.6% per annum in the 2016-2040 time frame, much higher than oil's 0.5%. This explains the company's intention to shift toward natural gas production. Last year, the company brought quite a few gas projects online that included the Zohr field of Egypt. Focusing on assets of natural gas in the country further ensures the potential of the gas reserves in Egypt. Additionally, along with its partners like Eni S.p.A. (E  -  Free Report) and others, BP is responsible for 30% of Egypt's gas production.The divestment is also expected to enable the company concentrate on deepwater gas fields off the country’s Mediterranean coast.About BP & Price PerformanceLondon-based BP is among the leading integrated energy players in the world. The company has a strong portfolio of upstream projects that are expected to fetch significant cash flows.Over the past year, BP has rallied 15.5%, outperforming the industry’s 7.4% gain.Zacks Rank and Other Stocks to ConsiderBP carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Other top-ranked stocks in the oil and energy sector are ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report) and Pioneer Natural Resources Company (PXD  -  Free Report), both sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

1430,COP,"Enbridge Energy Partners, L.P. (EEP  -  Free Report) has announced the initial evaluation of the effects of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's (FERC) recent policy change, related to the recovery of income tax amounts included in the cost of service rates of pipelines within a master limited partnership (MLP).A major change in its long-standing policy was announced by FERC on Mar 15, 2018. Pursuant to this, permit entities organized as master limited partnerships (MLPs), would no longer be able to recover an income tax allowance in the respective cost of service rates.  The policy in place since 2005, has always treated the income tax amounts as inclusion in the rates of pipelines and other entities, subject to cost of service rate regulation within an MLP.Enbridge Energy Partners, organized as an MLP, used to charge certain amount of the rates applicable to its expansion projects annually on a cost of service basis through the Lakehead Facility Surcharge Mechanism (FSM).The firm plans to ask for rehearing of this policy change at the FERC. The commission's new policy will be effective when it gets published in the Federal Register probably on Mar 31, 2018 for the purpose of estimating the 2018 impact.However, if FERC’s new policy is approved ditto its announcement, then Enbridge Energy Partners’ revenues would be reduced by around $100 million and distributable cash flow (DCF) by $60 million in 2018.Per the prior preliminary analysis and estimates, Enbridge Energy Partners is altering its 2018 DCF guidance range to $650-$700 million from $720-$770 million and that of 2018 total distribution coverage to about 1.0x from about 1.15x.More clarification is required with respect to the new policy statement’s implementation while the partnership firm will keep an eye on evaluating the financial impact on its operation as and when more information is available.Price PerformanceEnbridge Energy Partners’ shares have underperformed its industry in the last three months. The stock has lost 23.6% compared with the industry’s 8.4% decline. Zacks Rank & Key PicksEnbridge Energy Partners carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).A few better-ranked stocks in the same sector are Statoil ASA , Pioneer Natural Resources Company (PXD  -  Free Report) and ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report), each of the three sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

1431,COP,"Eni SpA (E  -  Free Report) has released its strategic plan for 2018-2021, signifying a usual progression of the same executed in the previous years and intends to continue boosting all business value.The company has undergone a successful transformation, resulting in a more integrated set-up, well positioned for further growth in the upstream sector. The mid-downstream businesses have also been reorganized, making them financially more sound and prepared to generate worth even in the low oil price scenarios.DividendEni intends to increase the dividend for 2018 to €0.83 per share, up 3.75% from 2017, fully payable in cash.UpstreamDuring the 2018-2021 period, Eni proposes to invest about €3.2 billion for exploring new acres of land, with resource potential of 2 billion barrels of oil and gas. The company plans to drill around 115 wells in more than 25 countries worldwide and include a new net acreage of 400 thousand square kilometers.Over the same phase, hydrocarbon production is estimated to grow 3.5% a year. This in turn will be backed by the ramp-up and commissioning of new projects, which is likely to contribute about 700 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2021.From 2018 to 2021, Eni expects a cumulative free cash flow generation of €22 billion, subject to the success of the exploration strategy and the extensive portfolio of new conventional projects with a break-even of less than $30/barrel together with a rigorous financial discipline.Gas and PowerThe segment is projected to witness rapid growth in the company’s liquefied natural gas (LNG) portfolio with a target set to reach 12 million tons per year of contracted volumes in 2021 and 14 million by 2025. Further, through the improvement of the equity component, the volumes will be expanded to 70% in 2021 from 30% in 2017.Moreover, the gas portfolio and retail sector in Europe would register growth. It expects a customer base of about 11 million in 2021, up 25% from 2017. These upsides would help the business attain a wide clientele base of 800 million in 2021, of which 60% would come from retail and increase from 300 million of 2018. Cumulative free cash flow during 2018-21 is predicted at €2.4 billion.Refining & Marketing and ChemicalsUnder this segment, Eni expects strong growth during the planned period with a cumulative free cash flow of more than €2 billion and an EBIT of €900 million in 2021.To achieve these targets, Eni needs to restart the Sannazzaro EST plant by the end of 2018, boost the green refining capacity as well as the bio-refinery in Gela would come online by the end of 2018 and the second phase of development of Venice would conclude by 2021. Moreover, consolidation of the company’s leading marketing position in Italy, capitalizing on the new sustainable mobility initiatives would also be required.ChemicalsIn this segment, Eni estimates to achieve an EBIT of about €400 million in 2021. This can be attained by boosting integration and efficiency, enhancing the production portfolio of differentiated products, international development, escalating the company’s presence in Asia and growing its commercial footprint in the Americas and in the Far East. Consolidation of organic chemistry is also possible through leveraging new industrial platforms from renewable sources.New Energy SolutionsThe latest New Energy Solutions business is expected to grow over the four-year period. The growth would be attributable to a unique model based on incorporation with existing assets and activities, which will lead to creation of new opportunities and value. This unique model will bring synergies in energy costs for production facilities, thus making more gas available for local consumption or export. The expected return on these projects will be about 10%. Over the next two years, Eni’s new energy capacity will rise by about 400 MW. This will be mainly because of the ongoing projects and those already recognized. Moreover, through investments worth €1.2 billion, Eni will develop 1 GW of new capacity by 2021 and up to 5 GW by 2025, over the medium to long term.Decarbonization ProcessEni has outlined a decarbonization process and expects to follow a comprehensible and definite climate strategy with total investment of more than €1.8 billion in the four-year period of 2018-21. The model emphasizes a cut in direct GHG (greenhouse gas) emissions by about 43% compared with 2014 through projects designed at reducing process flaring, eliminating fugitive emissions of methane and achieving energy efficiency measures. The new upstream projects in execution have break-even points below $30 per barrel. The second phase of the Venice bio-refinery will also be developed along with a startup at Gela in Sicily by the end of 2018 and consolidation in green chemistry.Financial StrategyThe capital expenditure for this four-year plan is estimated at less than €32 billion. It will focus on high-value projects with quick returns. Of the total capex, over 80% will be allocated to the upstream, about €3.5 billion is apportioned for the repair and maintenance (R&M) while the chemicals business is anticipated to have about 10% return rate. Moreover, the amount will provide ample flexibility as more than 50% of the investments will not be committed by 2021.Based on Brent price of $60 per barrel, Eni is assumed to realize an operating cash flow of more than €11 billion in 2018, which might further appreciate above €2 billion in 2021 for the same scenario.Price PerformanceEni’s shares have gained 3.3% in the last three months against the industry’s 2.6% decline. Zacks Rank & Key PicksEni carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1432,COP,"The U.S. Energy Department's inventory release showed that crude stockpiles recorded a massive weekly build as domestic oil production reached another all-time high. However, product inventories (gasoline and distillate) fell sharply, which offset the bearish impact of the crude oil inventory increase.The front month West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures ended at $61.19 per barrel yesterday.Analysis of the EIA DataCrude Oil: The federal government’s EIA report revealed that crude inventories rose by 5 million barrels for the week ending Mar 9, following an increase of 2.4 million barrels in the previous week. The analysts surveyed by S&P Global Platts – the leading independent commodities and energy data provider – had expected crude stocks to go up some 2.5 million barrels.Record high domestic production led to the massive stockpile build with the world's biggest oil consumer even as imports fell and refiner demand strengthened.In particular, U.S. output rose by 12,000 barrels per day last week to nearly 10.4 million barrels per day – the most since the EIA started maintaining weekly data in 1983. In early February, oil production broke through the 10 million barrels a day threshold for the first time in nearly 50 years and has maintained the record levels thereafter.While oil inventories rose for a third successive week, stockpiles have shrunk in 35 of the last 49 weeks and are down more than 100 million barrels since April last year. The gradual fall has helped the U.S. crude market shift from year-over-year storage surplus to a deficit. At 430.9 million barrels, current crude supplies are 18.4% below the year-ago period and are in the bottom half of the average range during this time of the year.Meanwhile, stocks at the Cushing terminal in Oklahoma – the key delivery hub for U.S. crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange – was up by 338,000 barrels to 28.5 million barrels. It is the first time in 12 weeks that Cushing inventories have increased after dropping to the lowest level since December 2014.The crude supply cover was up from 26.7 days in the previous week to 26.9 days. In the year-ago period, the supply cover was 34.1 days.Gasoline: Gasoline supplies recorded their second weekly decrease in a row as demand strengthened. The 6.3 million barrels draw – significantly above the polled number of 500,000 barrels fall in supply level – took gasoline stockpiles down to 244.8 million barrels. Following last week’s hefty decline, the stock of the most widely used petroleum product remains just below the year-earlier level though it is in the top half of the average range.Distillate: Distillate fuel supplies (including diesel and heating oil) were down 4.4 million barrels last week, comfortably exceeding analysts’ expectations for 1.6 million barrels decrease in supply level. The weekly fall could be attributed to lower production and imports. At 133.1 million barrels, current supplies are 15.4% below the year-ago level and are in the lower half of the average range for this time of the year.Refinery Rates: Refinery utilization was up by 2% from the prior week to 90%.About the Weekly Petroleum Status ReportThe Energy Information Administration (EIA) Petroleum Status Report, containing data of the previous week ending Friday, outlines information regarding the weekly change in petroleum inventories held and produced by the U.S., both locally and abroad.The report provides an overview of the level of reserves and their movements, thereby helping investors understand the demand/supply dynamics of petroleum products. It is an indicator of current oil prices and volatility that affect the businesses of the companies engaged in the oil and refining industry.The data from EIA generally acts as a catalyst for crude prices and affect producers, such as ExxonMobil (XOM  -  Free Report), Chevron (CVX  -  Free Report) and ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report), and refiners such as Valero Energy (VLO  -  Free Report), Phillips 66 (PSX  -  Free Report) and Marathon Petroleum (MPC  -  Free Report).Want to Own an Energy Stock Now?If you are looking for a near-term energy play, Concho Resources Inc.

1433,COP,"Brazil's state-run energy giant Petróleo Brasileiro S.A. (PBR  -  Free Report) or Petrobras announced fourth-quarter earnings per ADR of 20 cents, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 18 cents. However, the bottom line fell by a penny year over year. The earnings beat was supported by higher oil prices, partially negated by lower production and decreased margin from downstream operations.Petrobras’ free cash flows through 2017 increased almost 12% to $13,850 million, reflecting that the company has sufficient operating cashflow to support investment. However, adjusted EBITDA was down 6% year over year to $24,039 million. During 2017, exports of oil and oil products rose 23%, while imports fell 18%. This helped the company maintain the position of net exporter with a positive balance of 361 thousand barrels per day.Asset Disposal PlanOver the 2017-2018 period, the company intends to rake in proceeds of $21 billion from asset sale. This will help Petrobras strengthen its balance sheet by lowering debt.Revenue, Production and PricesThe troubled national oil company’s net fourth-quarter 2017 operating revenues of $23,567 million improved from the year-earlier sales of $21,403 million on higher crude prices but fell shy of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $26,321 million.The Rio de Janeiro-headquartered company’s total oil and gas production during the fourth quarter reached 2,737 thousand oil-equivalent barrels per day (MBOE/d) — 80.4% liquids — down from 2,868 MBOE/d in the same period of 2016. The decline can be attributed to issues related to operations in the Hadrian South gas field.Compared with the fourth quarter of 2016, Brazilian oil and natural gas production — constituting 96% of the overall output — dropped 4% to 2,636 MBOE/d.  In the October-to-December period, the average sales of oil in Brazil jumped 22.1% from the year-earlier period to $55.82 per barrel.Capital Spending & Balance SheetDuring the year ended Dec 31, 2017, Petrobras’ capital investments and expenditures totaled $13,639 million, lower than $14,085 million incurred in the year-ago period.This allowed the world's most indebted oil company to record the lowest debt over the last six years. At the end of December 2017, the company had net debt of $84,871 million, reflecting a decline from $96,381 million as of Dec 31, 2016. Net debt-to-capitalization ratio was approximately 51%, down from 55% a year ago. Additionally, Petrobras ended the fourth quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $22,519 million.Petroleo Brasileiro S.A.- Petrobras Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Petroleo Brasileiro S.A.- Petrobras Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Petroleo Brasileiro S.A.- Petrobras QuoteZacks Rank & Key PicksPetrobras carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), implying that it is expected to perform in line with the broader U.S. equity market over the next one to three months.

1434,COP,"Eni SpA (E  -  Free Report) boosted production at Nooros gas field to 32 million cubic meters per day or about 215,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d).The production level marks the highest in ten decades by an Eni field in Egypt. The level was achieved owing to the commissioning of the NW-7, the 13th well within this field. The production will be boosted when a 14th well, currently under drilling, is brought online by June 2018. This is estimated to boost production to 34 million cubic meters per day or about 230,000 boe/d.Discovered in July 2015, the Nooros field lies in the Nile Delta offshore area. The field was brought into production within a month of discovery. Currently, Nooros is the leading gas producing field in the company’s Egyptian asset portfolio. It is also an example of the company’s integrated model success. The discovery reflects Eni’s ‘near field’ exploration strategy, which aspires to trace potential additional reserves located nearby to already existing upstream infrastructures.In the mid-term, Nooros’ development will be escalated following the extension of the development lease that will involve investments, especially the construction of a new pipeline connecting Nooros with the El Gamil onshore treatment plant by year end 2018 and early 2019. These developments will make certain the attainment of above-production level in the mid-term while maximizing recoverable reserves.The measures will include the commissioning of Baltim SW along with the ramp up of any future exploration potential in the Nile Delta area. Eni holds a 50% stake through its affiliate IEOC Production BV, in Baltim SW, while BP plc (BP) holds the remaining 50%.Eni holds a 75% stake through its affiliate IEOC Production BV, in the Nile Delta Concession, where Nooros is located, while BP holds the remaining 25%.Price PerformanceEni’s shares have gained 3.2% in the last three months against the industry’s 3.5% decline. Zacks Rank & Key PicksEni carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked players in the same sector are Statoil ASA , Pioneer Natural Resources Company (PXD  -  Free Report) and ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report).

1435,COP,"Statoil ASA  wants to rebrand itself as Equinor. The board of directors of the company wants to take out the ""oil"" from the name, expecting the move to reflect the company's growing interest and reach beyond petroleum.Why Equinor?The first part of the name, ""Equi"", stands for equal, equality and equilibrium, while ""nor"" indicates its Norwegian origin. As the company is trying to be at the front of the energy transition movement from oil and gas to greener sources, it wants to plough in 15-20% of its total spending in renewable energy by 2030, profoundly improving from 5% in 2017.The company's strategy of developing a competitive portfolio, where low-carbon advantage takes a huge part, underpins the name change. Notably, in 2017, the company’s carbon emission reduction per barrel of oil equivalent increased more than 10% from the previous year. Moreover, in the last six months, the company has invested in offshore wind power and solar energy.Statoil's movement to rebrand itself comes just a few months after Norway’s trillion-dollar pension fund proposed to end its investments in oil and gas stocks. The government's intention was to steer away from the country's exposure to the volatility in the oil market.Statoil expects the rebranding and focusing more on renewables to not change the company's backbone, the Norwegian continental shelf. The fate of rebranding will be decided on May 15, 2018, when the name will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting of the company. We note that 67% of the company is owned by the government of Norway, which has approved the change. Moreover, the unions of employees in the company are in favor of the move.Per Bloomberg, the change of name is expected to cost the company in the range of 230 million kroner ($30 million)-250 million kroner.About the CompanyStatoil is a Norway-based major international integrated oil and gas company. The company has operations in all major hydrocarbon-producing regions of the world. It has an upstream focus on the Norwegian Continental Shelf. Due to strong offshore exposure, Statoil is a leader in subsea production. The company operates in four segments — Development and Production Norway, Development and Production International, Marketing, Midstream and Processing, as well as Other.Price PerformanceStatoil has gained 31.9% in the last year compared with 6.8% growth of its industry. Zacks Rank and Other Stocks to ConsiderStatoil sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Other top-ranked stocks in the oil and energy sector are ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report), Delek US Holdings, Inc.

Around $300 million investment in the project has made the pipeline capable of carrying 800 million cubic feet of natural gas a day to the Cameron LNG export facility, which is expected to come online by the end of 2019.Project RelevanceThe project, apart from increasing the midstream company’s fee-based revenues, is expected to generate substantial value for TransCanada's clients. The bi-directional pipeline will enable LNG producers to ship their domestic output to the export market in the U.S. Gulf Coast.Moreover, TransCanada expects the project to be part of reducing carbon emissions. With coal-fired power generation being replaced globally by cleaner energy source, natural gas, the pipeline will help countries in the emerging markets by giving them access to the commodity.About the CompanyCalgary, Canada-based TransCanada is a North American energy infrastructure provider. The company is focused on natural gas transmission and power services. The company's natural gas transmission networks reach more than 91,900 kilometers and strike almost all the major North American gas supply basins.Price Performance TransCanada has lost 4.4% in the last year compared with 11% fall of its industry. Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderTransCanada has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the oil and energy sector are ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report), Delek US Holdings, Inc.

1437,COP,"On Mar 15, EOG Resources, Inc. (EOG  -  Free Report) was upgraded to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Why the Upgrade?For first-quarter 2018, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share has been revised higher from 82 cents to 88 cents over the last 30 days. The consensus estimate for 2018 earnings was revised to $4.11 from $3.60 over the same period.Moreover, the leading oil and gas explorer has an impressive earnings surprise history, the average positive earnings surprise being 25.7% for the last four quarters.Along with the announcement of fourth-quarter results last month, EOG Resources reported an increase in total net proved reserves. Through 2017, the company saw an 18% increase in net proved reserves to 2,527 million barrels of oil equivalent (MMBoe), which entails higher future oil and gas production.We appreciate the company’s decision to complete higher wells during 2018. This year, EOG Resources plans for the completion of 690 net oil and gas wells versus 536 last year. Importantly, the company believes that a minimum of 90% of the completed wells will be premium. Such wells contribute 30% after tax return even if crude and natural gas traded lower at $40 per barrel and $2.50 per MMBtu respectively, per EOG Resources.EOG Resources has set a capital budget of $5.4 billion to $5.8 billion for 2018. Majority of the budget is expected to be spent for oil-rich resources like Eagle Ford, Delaware Basin and the Bakken. The decision seems impressive given that the company has a trailing 12-month return on capital investment of 3.1%, significantly higher than 1.9% of the Zacks Oil & Gas-U.S Exploration industry. Also, the upstream energy firm has gained 2.9% over the past year against the industry’s 12.7% decline. Other Stocks to ConsiderOther Zacks #1 Ranked players in the energy space include ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report), Pioneer Natural Resources Company (PXD  -  Free Report) and Concho Resources Inc. (CXO  -  Free Report). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. Headquartered in Houston, TX, ConocoPhillips is a major upstream energy player. The company is expected to witness year-over-year earnings growth of 380% in 2018.Headquartered at Irving, TX, Pioneer Natural Resources is an upstream energy firm. The company has an average positive earnings surprise of 66.9% for the last four quarters.Headquartered in Midland, TX, Concho is also an upstream energy company. The firm will likely see year-over-year earnings growth of 73.2% in 2018.Can Hackers Put Money INTO Your Portfolio?Earlier this month, credit bureau Equifax announced a massive data breach affecting 2 out of every 3 Americans.

1438,COP,"Companies with favorable efficiency levels are likely to be on investors’ radar irrespective of market conditions. After all, efficiency is a potential indicator of a company’s financial health.Moreover, a company with a favorable efficiency level is expected to provide impressive returns as it is believed to be positively correlated with its price performance.How to Measure Efficiency? We have considered four popular ratios in order to find efficient companies that have the potential to provide impressive returns.Inventory TurnoverInventory level is one of the key indicators of a company’s business health. While a high inventory level may indicate that the company is going through a rough patch in terms of sales, a dwindling level may indicate that it will run out of stock in a favorable sales condition. This is where inventory turnover comes into play. It is the ratio of 12-month cost of goods sold (COGS) to a 4-quarter average inventory. Thus, a high value of the ratio indicates a low level of inventory relative to COGS, while a low ratio signals that the company has excess inventory.Receivables TurnoverThis ratio is used to measure a company’s capability to extend its credit and collect debts on the basis of that credit. Receivables turnover ratio or the “accounts receivable turnover ratio” or the “debtor’s turnover ratio” is calculated by dividing 12-month sales by four-quarter average receivables. While a high ratio indicates that the company efficiently collects its accounts receivables or has quality customers, a low ratio signals that the company has an inefficient collection procedure or has low-quality customers or an inefficient credit policy.Asset UtilizationThis is a widely used measure of a company’s efficiency. Asset utilization indicates a company’s potential to utilize its assets. It is a ratio of total sales over the past 12 months to the last 4-quarter average of total assets. So, the higher the ratio, the greater is the chance that the company is utilizing its assets efficiently. On the contrary, a low value of the ratio signals that it is failing to use its assets effectively.Operating MarginAnother popular efficiency ratio is operating margin. Operating profit margin, which is simply operating income over the past 12 months divided by sales over the same period, indicates how well a company is controlling its operating expenses. If a company has a high operating profit margin in relation to its competitors, it is doing a better job at controlling operating expenses.All these ratios can be considered as effective measures if one compares different companies within a particular sector or industry. This is the reason why we have considered only those companies that have higher ratios than their respective industry averages.Screening ParametersIn addition to the above mentioned ratios, we have added a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to the screen with an objective to make this strategy more profitable. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Inventory Turnover, Receivables Turnover, Asset Utilization and Operating Margin greater than industry average (Values of these ratios higher than industry averages may indicate that the efficiency level of the company is higher than its peers.)The use of these few criteria has narrowed down the universe of over 7,906 stocks to only 22.Here are five stocks from the 22 that made it through the screen:Copart, Inc. (CPRT  -  Free Report) provides online auctions and vehicle remarketing services.

1439,COP,"U.S. energy firm Apache Corporation (APA  -  Free Report) reported first-quarter earnings per share – excluding one-time items – of 32 cents, ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 26 cents and the year-ago adjusted profit of 8 cents. The outperformance stems from higher oil realizations and greater-than-expected volumes from the key Permian Basin region.Revenues of $1,742 million were above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,648 million but was 7.2% below the first-quarter 2017 sales of $1,878 million.Production Growth, Higher Selling PricesThe production of oil and natural gas (excluding divested assets and non-controlling interests) averaged 366,965 oil-equivalent barrels per day (BOE/d) (67% liquids), up 6% from last year. Apache’s production for oil and natural gas liquids (NGLs) was 247,035 barrels per day (Bbl/d), while natural gas output came in at 719,565 thousand cubic feet per day (Mcf/d).In the company's Permian Basin acreage, average production volumes improved to a record 182,972 BOE/d from 146,448 in the first quarter of 2017. Results were also above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 177,000 BOE/d, helped by operational progress and the high quality of Apache’s inventory. For 2018, the company forecasts its Permian resources to continue the high-return growth.The average realized crude oil price during the first quarter was $64.27 per barrel, representing an increase of 25.5% from the year-ago realization of $51.20. Moreover, the average realized natural gas price during the March quarter of 2018 was $2.77 per thousand cubic feet (Mcf), up 1.1% from the year-ago period.Apache increased its 2018 annual production guidance to 250,000-258,000 BOE/dfrom 245,000-255,000BOE/d, representing annual production per share growth of 14%. The expected improvement in this year’s volume is driven by higher number of operating wells in the first quarter.Apache Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Apache Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Apache Corporation QuoteBalance Sheet, Capital Spending & Lease Operating ExpensesAs of Mar 31, 2018, the oil giant, with a market capitalization of just over $15 billion, had approximately $1,077 million in cash and cash equivalents. The company had long-term debt of $7,936 million, representing a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 51.4%.During the oil rout, Apache– like many other oil and gas players including ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report) and Marathon Oil Corporation (MRO  -  Free Report) – aligned its spending plans with the low-price environment.But Apache has since then increase its capital investment after achieving cost rationalization. With returns-focused growth in mind, Apache shelled out $3,089 million in 2017, representing a 75% increase over its 2016 spend. Keeping with the company’s planned shift in strategic objective, Apache’s guidance for oil and gas investments for this year remains unchanged at $3,000 million.  Apache’s first-quarter lease operating expenses totaled $349 million, up 3.9% from the year-ago quarter. Moreover, total operating expenses edged up 1% from the corresponding period of 2017 to $1,354 million.Zacks Rank & Stock PicksApache currently retains a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Meanwhile, one can look at a better-ranked energy player like Wildhorse Resource Development Corporation (WRD  -  Free Report) - a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock.(You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.)Wildhorse is a company focused on the acquisition, development, exploration and operation of unconventional, onshore oil and gas properties in the northeastern end of the Eagle Ford Play in South Texas.

1440,COP,"It was a week where oil prices ended modestly down but natural gas futures tilted higher.On the news front, U.S.-based integrated major Chevron Corporation (CVX  -  Free Report) and European counterpart Royal Dutch Shell plc (RDS.A  -  Free Report) reported strong numbers, helped by rebounding commodity prices. However, world's largest publicly traded oil company Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM  -  Free Report) and France-based TOTAL S.A. (TOT  -  Free Report) came up with weaker-than-expected earnings reports despite higher oil realizations.Overall, it was a mixed week for the sector. While West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures edged down 0.4% to close at $68.10 per barrel, natural gas prices gained about 1.2% to $2.771 per million Btu (MMBtu). (See the last ‘Oil & Gas Stock Roundup’ here: Schlumberger & Halliburton's Q1, TOTAL's Acquisition & More)The oil benchmark was little changed as the upside from the possibility of United States re-imposing sanctions on Iran was more than offset by bearish EIA crude inventory numbers.Of late, crude prices have been supported by indications that the Trump administration might lead America's exit from the landmark Iran nuclear deal if the European allies do not agree to toughen the terms by May 12. The return of sanctions would put pressure on OPEC’s third-largest oil producer’s energy industry and reduce global supply.But the Iran-induced gains were overshadowed by the Energy Department's inventory release, which revealed a surprise weekly build in crude stockpiles. A rise in the oil drilling rig count – pointing to an increase in domestic output – also played spoilsport.Meanwhile, natural gas prices moved northward last week following a larger-than-expected decrease in supplies. Investors were encouraged by another unseasonal inventory drawdown that further pushed back the commencement of the injection season.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    Energy giant Exxon Mobil posted lower-than-expected earnings in first-quarter 2018, thanks to plunge in oil equivalent production, decreased refinery throughput and lower margins at the chemical business. This was partially offset by increased price realizations from liquids. To be precise, the company reported earnings of $1.09 per share, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.14.Days before the earnings release, Exxon Mobil board of directors approved a hike in the quarterly dividend. The second-quarter 2018 dividend was 82 cents per share, higher than 77 cents in the first quarter.Production averaged 3.889 million barrels of oil-equivalent per day (MMBOE/d), lower than 4.151 MMBOE/d in the year-ago quarter. Liquid production fell year over year to 2.216 million barrels per day. Moreover, natural gas production was 10.038 MMCF/d (millions of cubic feet per day), down from 10.908 MMCF/d in the year-ago quarter.During the quarter under review, Exxon Mobil generated cash flow of $9.9 billion from operations and asset divestments, marking the highest level since 2014. The energy giant returned $3.3 billion to shareholders through dividends. Capital and exploration spending rose roughly 17% year over year to almost $4.9 billion.

The company reported earnings per share of $1.90, significantly ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.45.Quarterly revenues of $37,764 million lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $38,737 on refining weakness but was up 13% year over year.Chevron’s total production of crude oil and natural gas increased 6.6% compared with last year’s corresponding period to 2,852 thousand oil-equivalent barrels per day (MBOE/d). The U.S. output rose 9.1% year over year to 733 MBOE/d but the company’s international operations (accounting for 74% of the total) was up 5.7% to 2,119 MBOE/d.Importantly, Chevron delivered a good cash flow performance this quarter – an important gauge for the oil and gas industry – with $5,043 million in cash flow from operations, up from $3,777 million a year ago.(Read more Chevron Shares Gain After Posting Big Q1 Earnings Beat)3.    Europe’s largest oil company Royal Dutch Shell reported strong first-quarter results as rebounding commodity prices and continued improvement of its integrated gas unit helped the company in coming out with better-than-expected numbers.The Hague-based Shell reported earnings per ADS (on a current cost of supplies basis, excluding items - the market’s preferred measure) of $1.28, going past the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.24. Revenues of $91,114 million also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $81,020 million.During the quarter under review, Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) Shell generated cash flow from operations of $9,427 million, returned $4,000 million to shareholders through dividends and spent $5,183 million on capital projects. Despite falling marginally from the year-ago period, the company’s resilient cash generation has helped it to cover cash dividend payments and interest. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Shell has already aborted its two-and-a half-year long scrip dividend program as cost-containment efforts and divestment strategies have paid off. Importantly, the group raked in $5,178 million in free cash flow during the first quarter. (Read more Shell's Q1 Earnings Jump on Higher Commodity Prices)4.    French supermajor TOTAL S.A. reported first-quarter 2018 operating earnings of $1.09 per share (€0.89 per share), lagging the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.12 by 2.7%. The bottom line improved 8% from the year-ago figure of $1.01 (€0.95 per share). This was due to solid operational performance, steadily decreasing manufacturing costs and new project ramp ups, boosting production.Total hydrocarbon production during the first quarter averaged a record 2,703 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day, up 5% year over year. The increase was due to higher contribution from Kashagan, Moho Nord, Fort Hills, Edradour-Glenlivet and Yamal LNG, partially offset by natural field decline and PSC price effect. Improved security condition in Libya and Nigeria also boosted production.Cash and cash equivalents as of Mar 31, 2018 were $30.09 billion, compared with $27.52 billion as of Mar 31, 2017. Net debt-to-equity ratio was 15.1% at the end of the quarter, down from 18.1% at the end of first-quarter 2017.Cost-reduction initiatives have resulted in cost savings of $3.7 billion in 2017 and the company aims to save more than $4 billion in 2018. TOTAL’s upstream production is expected to increase 6% in 2018, in sync with its objective to grow 5% per year on an average between 2016 and 2020. (Read more TOTAL Q1 Earnings Miss, Production at Record High)5.    Upstream energy player ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report) reported first-quarter 2018 adjusted earnings of 96 cents per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 74 cents. Revenues of $8,961 million steered past the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8,680 million. The strong first-quarter results were supported by higher oil and natural gas price realizations.Production from continuing operations averaged 1,269 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (MBOED) in the quarter, lower than 1,593 MBOED in the year-ago quarter. The decline was led by divestment of assets and decline of field.As of Mar 31, 2018, the company had total cash and cash equivalents of $5.2 billion and debt of $17.1 billion, with a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 36%. In the reported quarter, ConocoPhillips generated $2.4 billion in cash from operating activities. Capital expenditures and investments totaled $1.5 billion and dividends payments grossed $338 million.ConocoPhillips reiterated its 2018 capital spending at $5.5 billion. For the April-to-June quarter of this year, the company projects production in the range of 1,170-1,210 MBOED.

The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because ConocoPhillipsis seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for COP in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at 76 cents per share for COP, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of 75 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for COP, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +0.62% heading into earnings season.ConocoPhillips Price and EPS Surprise ConocoPhillips Price and EPS Surprise | ConocoPhillips QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10-year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here).Given that COP has a Zacks Rank #3 and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings.

1445,COP,"Results from 179 S&P 500 members are already out, bearing evidence to a strong start this earnings season.Picture This FarPer the latest Earnings Trends report dated Apr 20, 87 S&P 500 members have already reported results with their total earnings up 25% from the same period last year on 10.7% higher revenues. Notably, 82.8% of the firms surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings, while 67.8% topped revenue estimates.So far, just five of the energy companies on the S&P 500 index have reported their Q1 results. These include Halliburton Company, Kinder Morgan, Inc., Schlumberger Limited, Baker Hughes and Hess Corporation.Both the oilfield services players, Schlumberger and Halliburton met earnings estimates, indicating that the North American drilling market remains robust, driven by increased activity. Kinder Morgan delivered an earnings beat on the back of increased contribution from the liquid terminals and Texas Interstate System. Further, Baker Hughes and Hess Corporation also delivered better than expected results.Year-over-Year Gain Leads to Bullish ExpectationsA look back at the last earnings season reflects that earnings for the energy sector saw the strongest growth, recording a massive 136.6% year-over-year gain on 23.6% higher revenues.Also, for the first quarter of 2018, we expect the energy sector to eclipse all the 16 Zacks sectors. Per our expectations, earnings for the sector are expected to jump 59.6% from first-quarter 2017, while the top line is likely to witness an improvement of 15.9% from the year-ago levels.What’s Going in Favor of the Energy SectorThe first quarter of the year saw the U.S. oil benchmark attain its highest settlement since December 2014, despite record high domestic production. Per EIA data, the commodity rose about 7.5% in the first three months of 2018 to finish the quarter at $64.87 per barrel. It goes without saying that all oil-related stocks are thus poised to benefit from recovering commodity prices, as they will be able to extract more value for their products.Crude was supported by various catalysts, including strong demand and continued production curb from OPEC and its allies. Needless to say, such favorable developments have buoyed investors’ optimism surrounding the sector’s first-quarter results.Stocks’ Earnings to Watch on Apr 26Let’s find out what’s in store for the below-mentioned five energy companies that are slated to release their quarterly numbers on Apr 26.Contract drilling services provider Helmerich & Payne Inc. (HP  -  Free Report) is expected to report fiscal second-quarter 2018 results before the opening bell.In the preceding quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 85.71% on the back of higher drilling activities at its U.S. Land Segment. Further, the company delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 37.06% in the last four quarters.According to our quantitative model, a company needs the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — to increase its odds of an earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Note that we caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Ranks #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Our proven model shows that Helmerich & Payne is likely to beat earnings estimates because it has the right combination of two key ingredients. The company has an Earnings ESP of +16.93% and a Zacks Rank #3. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Recovering commodity prices along with higher rig utilization in Helmerich & Payne’s largest segment — U.S. Land segment — are expected to buoy the results this quarter also. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Helmerich & Payne’s largest segment’s operating income is pegged at $27.51 million, up from the last quarter’s figure of $24.75 million and the year-ago quarter’s operating loss of $51.85 million. (Read More: Can Helmerich & Payne Deliver a Beat in Q2 Earnings?)Pittsburgh, PA-based integrated energy company EQT Corporation (EQT  -  Free Report) is slated to come up with January-March operational results before the opening bell.As far as earnings surprises are concerned, EQT — an Appalachia-focused natural gas firm, with primary focus on production and midstream operations — has a decent record, having missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate just once in the last four reports.For this quarter as well, our model predicts an earnings beat as it has a Zacks Rank #3 and Earnings ESP of +18.59%.Per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, the average daily sales volume for the first quarter is pegged at 3,959 million cubic feet equivalent per day (MMcfe/d), higher than 3,200 MMcfe/d in the preceding quarter and 2,110 MMcfe/d in the year-ago quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in the Production segment is pegged at $371 million, reflecting an increase from $267 million in the last quarter and $257 million in the year-ago quarter.( Read more: EQT Corp Gears Up for Q1 Earnings: A Beat in Store?)The largest independent refiner and marketer of petroleum products in the United States, Valero Energy Corporation (VLO  -  Free Report), is another company to come up with quarterly numbers before the opening bell.The company boasts an excellent track record of having outperformed estimates in each of the last four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 10.26%.However, our model indicates that Valero Energy’s earnings streak might come to a halt this time around, as the company does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients. While the company carries a Zacks Rank #3, its negative Earnings ESP of 4.58% makes surprise prediction difficult.While improved refining margins and tax reform benefits bode well for the downstream operator, unplanned downtime and weather-related issues might affect Valero’s bottom line in the first quarter of 2018. (Read More: What to Expect From Valero Energy in Q1 Earnings?)Then there is Houston, TX-based exploration and production major, ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report), coming up with first-quarter numbers tomorrow, before the opening bell.ConocoPhillips has an average positive earnings surprise of 144.45% in the trailing four quarters. Our model indicates that the company is likely to beat on earnings this time around too, as it has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of +0.62%.Higher expectations for prices of natural gas, natural gas liquid and crude oil will likely favor the company’s first-quarter earnings.Lastly there is Houston-based, National Oilwell Varco Inc. (NOV  -  Free Report), another energy company set to report results after the closing bell.  Last quarter, the company met the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 4 cents. In the trailing four quarters, National Oilwell witnessed a positive earnings surprise of 6.9%, without missing any estimates.Our proven model does not show that National Oilwell is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter, as it has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of -20.00%.Apparently, National Oilwell even warned investors that its first-quarter 2018 revenues are expected to miss expectations primarily due to declined progress in new offshore rig construction as well as client-associated equipment deferrals. The company expects its revenues to come in at $1.8 billion in the first quarter, reflecting 3.4% year-over-year decline.Investor Alert: Breakthroughs PendingA medical advance is now at the flashpoint between theory and realization. Billions of dollars in research have poured into it.

1446,COP,"The historic and so far successful energy reform of Mexico apparently faces risks if the leading candidate for presidency, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador wins the elections to be held on Jul 1. After almost eight long decades of state management, Mexico opened its energy market to foreign investors through five- year (2015-2019), two rounds per annum tender plans, which enabled the country to draw investment from oil-mammoths like Royal Dutch Shell PLC (RDS.A  -  Free Report), Chevron Corporation (CVX  -  Free Report), BP p.l.c. (BP  -  Free Report) and others. It effectively ended the reign of the state-run oil producer Petroleós Mexicanos (Pemex) in Mexico.Political SlugfestAndres Manuel Lopez Obrador, or AMLO, who represents the MORENA party, is now around 20 points ahead of its nearest competitor after the first presidential debate opened last Sunday. His view regarding Mexico’s energy sector is that of constrained freedom. He stated, ""We're not going to sell crude oil abroad. We're going to process all the raw material in our country to lower the price of fuel."" Notably Mexico is a major oil exporter and a huge portion of its supply reaches the refineries in the U.S. Gulf Coast, Asia, Europe and other places.He is hopeful that the policy will enable his administration to stop energy imports, following upgrades of the existing energy infrastructure. Notably, Mexico imported processed petroleum oils amounting to $24.8 billion last year, a 37.5% year-over-year increase.Andres Manuel asked the current President of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto to halt the upcoming auctions in July and September. The future of existing contracts will be uncertain if the import substitution policy takes place. We believe that overall investor sentiment will take a hit with these measures. Worse, it can drive investments away from the country and stifle growth of the sector.The Failure of PemexIndustry observers still believe that Pemex lacks the required technology as well as capital to develop onshore and offshore energy sources of Mexico. Production in the country dropped from 2005 onward under Pemex-rule. This makes AMLO’s plans appear pretty risky. In fact, the state-run oil company's output declined 10% year over year to average 1.948 million barrel per day (MMBbl/d) in 2017. Crude exports fell 1.7% during this period. Moreover, the refineries under the state-run company produced 915,100 barrels of fuel per day last year, compared with 1.6 million barrels per day capacity, which shows inefficiency.Importance of ReformFollowing the reform, Mexico drew multi-billion dollars' investment. It could lead up to an output of 3 MMBbl/d by the end of the planned period, as predicted by the supporters of the reform. The reform could also bring down electricity rates in the country. So far, Mexico has awarded around 90 contracts, both onshore and offshore. The country raised about $100 billion from the auctions by the end of January. With nine oil and gas blocks, Shell has emerged as the leading player in the auctions held so far. Other winners in the bidding processes include Eni S.p.A. (E  -  Free Report) of Italy, Inpex of Japan, France’s TOTAL S.A. (TOT  -  Free Report), Chevron and more.Moreover, BP opened 100 retail sites in the country in 2017 and plans to open 1,400 more by 2021. The largest publicly traded oil company, Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM  -  Free Report) opened its gas stations in Mexico in December, while one of the world's biggest independent oil producers – ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report) – showed interest in Mexico, post-reform. The company has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Following the reform, Mexico now has the opportunity of not investing taxpayer funds for exploration and production. Instead, private capital from large-cap oil majors has assumed the risk while paying taxes and royalties to the government. The government can use its capital in other more important causes, like health sector. It also brings an opportunity for Pemex to benefit from the state-of-the-art technologies and the financial muscle of overseas players. Our ViewThere’s a way through which both the country’s energy sector and politics can benefit. While co-existence of reform and closed energy sector is nearly impossible, AMLO can go for another option, which includes contractual changes and more entitlements for Pemex. Although it may keep some investors at bay, still, it will make the reform, as a whole, more nationalistic, and fetch more home support.Therefore, the upcoming election results will determine whether Mexico has got the ability, will and transparency to properly implement the safeguards and regulations of the country’s nascent energy reforms, keeping in mind the interests of potential investors as well as the public.Investor Alert: Breakthroughs Pending A medical advance is now at the flashpoint between theory and realization. Billions of dollars in research have poured into it. Companies are already generating substantial revenue, and even more wondrous products are in the pipeline.Cures for a variety of deadly diseases are in sight, and so are big potential profits for early investors.

1447,COP,"ExxonMobil Corporation (XOM  -  Free Report) recently attended an Australian Senate hearing for not paying taxes since 2013.Per the hearing, which forms part of a broader investigation related to corporate tax avoidance in Australia, the oil giant has evaded tax payments despite reporting large income from operations in the country.ExxonMobil stated that it is in a tax loss position mainly because of $21-billion capital investment in the country over the last 10 years. These investments mainly went into operations in the Bass Strait and the massive Gorgon gas project offshore Western Australia. However, the company has agreed to pay taxes after recovering funds from investments made in the country.ExxonMobil expects to start paying A$600 million a year in corporate tax starting 2021, while the Gorgon project is unlikely to begin paying petroleum resource rent tax until the mid-2030s.Currently, ExxonMobil is being scrutinized under an Australian tax audit connected to an inter-company or related party loan. Even if the Australian Taxation Office succeeds in the dispute, it will not have a significant impact on the company’s tax losses.In 2017, Chevron Corp (CVX  -  Free Report) lost a case to the Australian government in a landmark case over a contested tax bill of A$340 million ($267 million) stemming from a related party loan at an unusually high interest. The loan reduced the oil giant's taxable income in Australia.However, ExxonMobil stated that the facts in its loan under audit were very different from Chevron's, since the interest rates on its loan were set at about 3-5%.The Senate is likely to issue a final report relating to the probe into corporate tax avoidance by the end of May.  The probe that began in 2014 was a necessity, as close examination revealed a complex web of hundreds of foreign subsidiaries, which were avoiding tax.The country's tax authorities are already fighting major miners BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto as well as oil and gas giants over booking income in countries like the Netherlands and Singapore, where tax rates are lower.Price PerformanceExxonMobil’s shares have lost 11.3% in the last three months, compared with the industry’s 2.4% decline. Zacks Rank & Key PicksExxonMobil carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A few better-ranked players in the same sector are Statoil ASA  and ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report), each stock sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

1448,COP,"Pioneer Natural Resources Company (PXD  -  Free Report) recently reported that a fire broke out at a compressor station in its West Panhandle field, in Texas. The incident took place on Mar 6, 2018. The company reported no impairments connected to the incident.The fire caused huge damage to the company's facility. Pioneer's production from the West Panhandle field is expected to halt due to the damages. Production from the field averaged at around 8,000 barrels oil equivalent per day (BOE/d), of which roughly 20% was oil, 55% natural gas liquids and 25% gas. Total production in fourth-quarter 2017 averaged approximately 305 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (MBOE/d), up 26.1% year over year, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 298 MBOE/d.Impacts on 2018 ResultsThe company fears its first-quarter 2018 production to get affected due to the stoppage of production in the field by around 2,000 BOE/d. Yet, Pioneer expects its total production in the first quarter to be in the guidance limit of 304,000-314,000 BOE/d. This can be supported by its Permian Basin outputs. Pioneer remains focused on the Permian Basin, which is among the lucrative oil shale plays with fewer risks for operation. The company expects first-quarter 2018 production from the basin to be in the range of 252,000-260,000 BOE/d.Additionally, in the Permian Basin, the company is expecting to start production from 250-275 wells in 2018, of which, 200-225 wells will be from the northern area, while 50 wells from the southern Wolfcamp joint venture area. The company’s focus on the Permian Basin is noteworthy as it provides ample growth opportunities.Alternative Option at HandAlthough the company can use some of its idle compressors to restart production in the West Panhandle field, production will likely start in late March or early April. Moreover, production will be then at its 80-90% of the earlier levels.Price PerformancePioneer has lost 5.4% in the past year compared with 9.9% decline of the industry it belongs to.About the CompanyIrving, TX-based Pioneer is an independent oil and gas exploration and production company.

1449,COP,"Statoil ASA  recently announced its decision to invest more than NOK 5 billion or $642 million for development purposes of its Askeladd field, located in the Barents Sea. The produced gas and condensate will be provided from the Askeladd field development, the second phase of the multi-phased Snøhvit development, to the liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant at Melkøya in Hammerfest, one of the world’s most energy-efficient LNG facilities.Partners in the FieldStatoil is the operator of the Snøhvit development and has a stake of 36.79%. It has Petoro, TOTAL S.A. (TOT  -  Free Report), Neptune Energy Norge and DEA Norge as partners in the development owning 30%, 18.40%, 12% and 2.81% stakes, respectively.About the ProjectTwo million cubic meters of condensate and 21 billion cubic meters of gas will be supplied from the Askeladd field to the Melkøya LNG plant. Production from the field is expected to begin by 2020-end. The development plan so far includes three wells through two new subsea templates. Enough space is there in the field so that more wells can be dug at the site later. The company is also expected to install an infrastructure that will link the Askeladd development, located south west of Snøhvit facility, to the existing Snøhvit infrastructure.Importance of AskeladdStatoil’s senior vice president for project development, Torger Rød said, ""Askeladd will help maintain a plateau production rate at the Hammerfest LNG plant until 2023 and is a profitable investment that will help secure jobs and ripple effects in the region.” Moreover, the LNG plant needs profitable gas volumes in the coming years till 2050, which will be supported by the new development. In early 2018, Aker Solutions received an engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contract for the Askeladd field.

1450,COP,"After misleading shareholders, politicians and the public regarding the risks of global warming from the usage of fossil fuel products like oil, natural gas and coal, major energy companies are under pressure to find ways to reduce it.Concerns about climate change and extreme weather events such as hurricanes, wildfires and droughts are on the rise. According to scientists, these calamities are a result of global warming. These factors are compelling oil companies to add low-carbon products and services to their businesses.Moreover, cities including New York City and San Francisco are suing oil majors like Chevron Corporation (CVX  -  Free Report), ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report), ExxonMobil Corporation (XOM  -  Free Report), Royal Dutch Shell plc (RDS.A  -  Free Report) and BP plc (BP  -  Free Report) to recover the expenses incurred while countering the impact of climate change. These include rising sea levels, which are the outcome of decades of greenhouse gases emitted from manufacturing and burning petroleum fuels.ExxonMobil and other oil companies are defending themselves in lawsuits slapped by local and state governments. However, the effects of these lawsuits on the companies are uncertain.Remedial Actions by Oil CompaniesCompanies such as Statoil ASA  and Total, SA (TOT  -  Free Report) are known for shifting long-term focus away from oil toward natural gas and renewable energy, which is in line with the global transition to a low-carbon economy. In fact, Total is likely to be the first oil and gas company, with some assets in alternative energies.Statoil sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Meanwhile, by 2030, Statoil plans to shift about 20% of its capital investments into renewables and low-carbon products. In the last several years, the company has made an investment of about $2.6 billion, which has been majorly allocatedto offshore wind farms.Among others, Royal Dutch Shell intends to reduce its carbon footprint by 50% through 2050 by growing into renewable energy and reducing exposure in oil and gas.There are other companies which are willing to cut emissions from their operations by boosting efficiency, plugging leaks and cutting back on gas flaring. However, these are temporary methods with short-term impacts. These companies will divest from renewables as soon as market conditions change. They did not mention any plans to boost investment in renewable energy or take other actions to cut down oil operations.Action Taken by World BankIn December 2017, the World Bank – one of the globe’s premier financial institution – announced that it will not provide funds for any upstream oil and gas projects after 2019. Meanwhile, the bank intends to focus on providing funds for projects that initiate energy efficiency, solar power and resilienceto help countries meet their climate goals under the Paris Agreement.The bank already stopped lending to coal projects in 2010. It is on track to have 28% of its lending going to climate action by 2020. The bank will make exceptions for natural gas developments in the poorest countries that need the fuel to provide access to energy for its citizens. Currently, about 1-2% of the bank’s $280 billion portfolio is allocated for oil and gas projects. This is expected to change soon as threats to climate changes are rapid.What’s Expected From Fossil Fuel CompaniesPer some environment protection groups, stringent regulations and their effective implementations will help reduce carbon emissions in the future and facilitate effective transition to cleaner and renewable energy sources. They believe that corporate governance and environmental management should work together to solve the problem.The companies should regularly and accurately disclose non-financial metrics, which includes carbon and methane emissions. These companies should strive focus on environment rather than profits to gain competitive advantage and brand loyalty.The global society demands fossil fuel companies to carry out operations that do not harm the environment. The companies should support prudent climate policies that guide toward reducing global warming emissions. Complete disclosure of the financial and physical risks of climate change to their business operations is vital. Such companies are required to pay for their share of the expenses of climate-related damages and climate change adaptation.Lastly, the oil majors are required to align their business models with a carbon-constrained world and keep global warming lower than a 2°C increase above pre-industrial levels, as agreed by world leaders. This indicates that absolute carbon emissions from all global energy utilization need to fall 63%, while absolute emissions from oil and gas products must fall 35-60%.Bottom LineThough oil is a necessary component for the growth of any nation, climate change and related advances in other energy sources make it less important. Moreover, the emphasis to shift to renewable energy is likely to dent prospects of the companies, which are unwilling to transform operations. These changes may appear restrained, since they imply a distinct shift in an industry that for years has struggled with government climate regulation and in many cases, sought to dim the need for action on global warming. However, investor’s concerns are high, which is likely to force oil companies to focus on other renewable sources of energy.Breaking News: Cryptocurrencies Now Bigger than VisaThe total market cap of all cryptos recently surpassed $700 billion – more than a 3,800% increase in the previous 12 months.

1453,COP,"A stock at a 52-week high level is perceived a winner. This level works as an indicator for many investors for buying or selling the stock.Quite often, investors start wondering if this level has made the stock an overpriced one. While they are not totally incorrect, all stocks hitting a 52-week high are not necessarily overpriced.In fact, a decision to avoid stocks that are trading near their 52-week high levels makes an investor miss out on most of the top gainers.A stock can maintain the momentum and keep scaling new highs with time. So, one should take a more informed approach to understand if any further upside is left.Here we discuss a strategy to find the right stocks:Borrowing from the basics of momentum investing, this technique bets on the catchphrase “buy high, sell higher.”52-Week High: A Good IndicatorMany a time, stocks hitting a 52-week high are prevented from scaling higher despite robust potential due to the psychological bias of investors, who fear that the stocks are overvalued and a price crash is impending.In fact, overvaluation is quite natural for most of these stocks as investors’ special attention (or willingness to pay premium) has helped them achieve the level. But that doesn’t always mean an impending decline. The factors — such as robust sales, surging profit levels, earnings growth prospects and strategic acquisitions — that motivated investors to bet on these stocks could keep them motivated if there is no tangible negative. In other words, the momentum might continue.Also, when a string of positive developments dominate the market, investors find their under-reaction unwarranted, even if there are no company-specific driving forces.Setting the Right FiltersWe ran a screen to zero in on 52-week high stocks (trading near the high level) that hold tremendous upside potential. The screen includes parameters to shortlist stocks with strong earnings growth expectations, sturdy value metrics and price momentum.Moreover, the screen filters stocks that are relatively undervalued compared to their peers, in terms of earnings as well as sales, ensuring continuation of their rally for some time.Current Price/52 Week High >= .80This is the ratio between the current price and the highest price at which the stock has traded in the past 52 weeks. A value greater than 0.8 implies that the stock is trading within 20% of its 52-week high range.% Change Price – 4 Weeks > 0It ensures that the stock price has moved north over the past four weeks.% Change Price – 12 Weeks > 0This metric guarantees a continued upward price momentum for the stock over the past three months as well.Price/Sales <= XIndMedThe lower, the better.P/E using F(1) Estimate <= XIndMedThis metric measures the amount an investor puts into a company to obtain one dollar of earnings. It narrows down the list of stocks to those that are undervalued compared to the industry.One-Year EPS Growth F(1)/F(0) >= XIndMedThis helps choose stocks that have higher growth rates than the industry. This is a meaningful indicator, as decent earnings growth adds to investor optimism.Zacks Rank =1No screening is complete without our proven Zacks Rank, which has proved its worth since inception. It is a fundamental truth that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) have always managed to brave adversities and beat the market. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Current Price >= 5This parameter will help screen stocks that are trading at $5 or higher.Volume – 20 days (shares) >= 100000Inclusion of this metric ensures that there is a substantial volume of shares, so trading is easier.Here are five of the 20 stocks that made it through the screen:Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (HPE  -  Free Report), which was formed as a result of the split of Hewlett-Packard Company into two separate entities, deals with enterprise and service business-oriented segments. The company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, the average positive surprise being 11.71%.NETGEAR, Inc.

1458,COP,"Eni SpA (E  -  Free Report) signed two Concession agreements with Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (“ADNOC”). The move is expected to strengthen the company’s footprint in the region, which is known to hold the largest hydrocarbon reserve in the world.The agreements include two offshore oil blocks in the Persian Gulf and marks Eni’s first expedition into oil development in the United Arab Emirates.For a total participation fee of about $875 million, the company acquired a 5% stake in the Lower Zakum offshore oil field and o a 10% stake in the oil, condensate and gas offshore fields of Umm Shaif and Nasr. The contract is for a period of 40 years.Located about 65 kilometers off the coast of Abu Dhabi, Lower Zakum, was discovered in 1963 and was brought online in 1967. Production from the license is targeted at 450,000 barrels of oil per day. Located about 135 kilometers from the coast of Abu Dhabi, Umm Shaif and Nasr have a target production of 460,000 barrels of oil per day.ADNOC — the operator of the licenses — has a stake of 60% each, while Eni holds the remaining 40%. Eni represents the fourth international company to gain access to one of ADNOC’s new offshore concessions. The agreements add to Eni’s Middle Eastern operations, which comprise producing crude in Libya and Iraq as well as natural gas at Egypt’s largest offshore field — Zohr.In spite of UAE’s effort to restrain output as part of a global attempt to clear a glut, Abu Dhabi intends to increase output capacity to 3.5 million barrels a day by the end of 2018. Currently, ADNOC can pump about 3 million barrels per day, with less than 50% coming from offshore deposits. Abu Dhabi is believed to hold about 6% of the world’s crude reserves.Eni’s expertise in exploration of resources will help ADNOC accelerate growth, enhance revenues and improve integration across the upstream value chain.

1460,COP,"Hess Corporation (HES  -  Free Report) announced a new share repurchase plan after receiving authorization from its board of directors. Through 2018, the explorer will likely buy back shares worth $1 billion.Late 2017, the company declared a $500-million stock buyback plan. The recent announcement reflects the firm’s strong commitment toward returning cash back to stock holders on a regular basis.The business scenario has improved owing to the partial recovery in crude. From the historical low-mark of $26.21 per barrel touched in February 2016, the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude crossed the $60 psychological level. A rally in oil price is highly favorable for key upstream energy players like Hess.The company foresees higher oil and gas production which when combined with healthy oil prices will likely boost cashflow. Hess added that with the new buyback program, it will not compromise with its potential to invest in key developments like Guyana and Bakken. Earlier, the company had announced that majority of its 2018 capital budget will likely get allotted toward low-cost resources in Bakken and projects located off the coast of Guyana.Overall, with the robust business outlook, the management might think the company’s shares are undervalued and hence is the right time to boost share buyback.Headquartered in New York, Hess is a leading explorer with a solid balance sheet. Through 2017, the company’s cash balance surged 77.4%, while long term debt contracted 4.4%.However, the company’s pricing chart is unimpressive. Over the past year, the stock has lost 3.5%, against the industry’s 4.3% gain. Hess carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A few better-ranked players in the energy sector are ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report), Pioneer Natural Resources Company (PXD  -  Free Report) and Concho Resources Inc. (CXO  -  Free Report).  Headquartered in Houston, TX, ConocoPhillips is a major upstream energy player. The company is expected to witness year-over-year earnings growth of 380% in 2018.Headquartered at Irving, TX, Pioneer Natural Resources is an upstream energy firm. The company has an average positive earnings surprise of 66.9% for the last four quarters.Headquartered in Midland, TX, Concho is also an upstream energy company.

1463,COP,"Uncertain trade policies have been weighing heavily on the stock market with tensions between the United States and China escalating right before the Q2 earnings season. This is especially true as Trump threatened to impose 10% tariff on further $200 billion Chinese goods and China warned of retaliatory moves.The latest round of tariff threats came following caution by Trump to impose additional tariffs on $500 billion in Chinese goods should Beijing retaliate against the U.S. tariffs on $34 billion in Chinese goods implemented on Jul 5.However, the optimism of double-digit growth has lifted investors’ sentiment amid intensifying fears of a full-scale global trade war. In particular, earnings for the S&P 500 index are expected to grow 19.1% from the same period last year on 8.12% higher revenues. This would represent the third consecutive quarter of double-digit earnings growth, a trend that is currently expected to continue in the second half of the year.

1465,COP,"Fresh trade war issues between the United States and China may have dented global oil prices to some extent. But, in the long run, supply side constraints amid escalating demand will surely boost oil prices.Let us not forget that oil prices did touch a four-year peak on Jul 10 due to such supply-side outages. Fresh workforce strikes in Gabon and Norway affected supply. At the same time, there are production disruptions in Venezuela and Libya as well as anticipation of a massive Iranian export dip.As the long run bodes well for oil prices, energy companies are expected to come up with robust results. Hence, investing in some of the sought-after oil majors doesn’t seem to be a bad proposition.Oil Prices Nearly Hits $80-a-BarrelOn Jul 10, the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude rose 26 cents or roughly 0.4%, to settle at $74.11 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The international benchmark Brent for September settlement rose 79 cents or 1% to end the session at $79.51 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. Crude futures finished higher yesterday, with the global benchmark tapping a session-high close to $80-a-barrel mark.Meanwhile, a separate report issued by the U.S. Energy Information Administration yesterday disclosed that the WTI and Brent crude price forecasts for 2018 and 2019 have moved up 2.2% and 1.1%, respectively.Despite record-high domestic production, the oil benchmark in the United States has attained its highest settlement since November 2014 so far this year. Price appreciation in the first half extends the upbeat tone in crude trade into the final six months of this year.What Stokes the Crude Price Rally?Steeper WTI and Brent futures curves mirror a stretched oil market scenario.   Fresh Workforce Strikes in Gabon & NorwayTuesday’s record gain in oil prices primarily stemmed from small labor strikes in Norway and Gabon. A small workers’ strike on the platforms of North Sea reportedly led to a decline in Norway’s crude and natural-gas liquid production by 23,000 barrels per day (bpd) and 3,500 bpd, respectively. Similarly, a 15-day laborer’s strike in the facilities of the French oil producer Total is predicted to slash Gabon’s crude output by 54,000 bpd.Venezuela, Libya & Canada Output WoesOutages in Canada, Libya and particularly the crisis-riddled Venezuela have significantly shrunk the cushion of spare capacity in the global energy industry. Venezuela is on the verge of an economic breakdown, with oil output dwindling more than 40% since 2016. Furthermore, renewed U.S. sanctions on the Maduro regime will strangle the energy sector of this Latin American nation. On the other hand, Libyan crude production is sliding every day on account of oil port closures. Since February, the country’s crude production has dipped from 1.28 million bpd to 527,000 bpd. Moreover, Syncrude Energy’s oil sands production outages will continue to weigh on Canadian crude supplies until mid-September.Imminent Decline in Iranian ExportsTrump’s stance over Iran has outpaced Wall Street’s expectations. The United States’ refusal to issue any waiver on cutting crude imports from Iran by Nov 4 has largely fueled the ongoing oil price rally. Last month, the U.S. President withdrew from a nuclear deal with OPEC’s third-largest producer and pledged to reimpose sanctions on Tehran. The action has spurred worries over an expected cut in Iranian oil exports – at 2.7 million barrels a day – by around one million barrels and led to a supply shortage in an already tight oil market.Other DriversRobust demand is also propelling oil prices lately. Crude consumption continues to rally on the back of sturdier global economic growth. Per the International Energy Agency (IEA), worldwide oil demand for 2018 will be 99.3 million bpd, up 1.5% year over year.Moreover, a break in U.S. share boom might also drive prices going forward. Shortages of skilled and pipeline workers is currently troubling the country’s shale facilities. Notably, the IEA predicts that American share boom will plateau in the 2020s.Top Five Energy PicksMultiple supply concerns and an upbeat demand side picture are serving well to boost crude prices at this moment. Investing in stocks of oil companies looks like a smart option at this point.On a year-to-date basis, the Zacks Oils-Energy sector rallied 5.5%, outperforming 4.4% growth recorded by the S&P 500 group.In sync with this, we have handpicked five top-ranked energy stocks that will likely add a sparkle to your portfolio.These stocks currently sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and flaunts a VGM Score of A.

1466,COP,"It was a week where both oil and natural gas finished lower.On the news front, Enbridge Inc. (ENB  -  Free Report) struck a pact to unload its Canadian natural gas gathering and processing businesses C$4.31 billion ($3.3 billion), while Chevron Corp. (CVX  -  Free Report) plans to put most of its oil and gas fields in the ageing North Sea for sale.Overall, it wasn’t a good week for the sector. While West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures edged down 0.5% to close at $73.80 per barrel, natural gas prices fell around 2.3% to $2.858 per million Btu (MMBtu). (See the last ‘Oil & Gas Stock Roundup’ here: BP, Baker Hughes, EQT & More)The U.S. crude benchmark slipped for the first time in three weeks following a shock build in domestic inventories and rise in the oil drilling rig count. President Donald Trump’s tweet demanding action by OPEC to calm rising oil prices also played spoilsport.Meanwhile, natural gas prices moved southward last week following a larger-than-expected increase in supplies.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    Enbridge Inc. is expected to raise C$4.31 billion ($3.3 billion) from the divestiture of its Canadian natural gas gathering and processing (G&P) business to Brookfield Infrastructure Partners L.P.The assets include G&P units in the Montney, Peace River Arch, Horn River and Liard basins in British Columbia and Alberta. The G&P units have a total operating capacity of 3.3 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d) and 3,550 kilometer of natural gas gathering pipelines. It comprises 19 natural gas processing plants and liquids handling facilities.The proceeds from this transaction will help Enbridge pare its C$61.2 billion debt load that it assumed following last year’s Spectra Energy buy. The latest deal takes the company’s divestments to C$7.5 billion for this year – significantly above the targeted C$3 billion.2.    Chevron is set to put up many of its North Sea oil and gas assets for sale, in a bid to streamline portfolio. The assets it intends to offload include Britannia and its satellites, along with Alba, Alder, Captain, Elgin/Franklin and Erskine fields. The move is part of Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) Chevron’s strategic review of global portfolio to determine the competitiveness of all its projects. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The decision seems to be a prudent one as extracting oil from North Sea is not so economical because production costs are much higher than the returns. Even other biggies like Bp plc and Royal Dutch Shell plc have jettisoned their non-core assets in the region. Early last year, Shell offloaded a large chunk of its North Sea assets to smaller rival Chrysaor Holdings Ltd. for $3.8 billion. BP also divested 25% of stake in the Magnus Field to EnQuest PLC.Notably, output from North Sea accounts for just about 3% of Chevron’s total production, providing around 50,000 barrels of oil and 155 million cubic feet of natural gas a day. Instead, the company wants to sharpen its focus on the lucrative shale exploration in Permian, along with some of its major projects in the Gulf of Mexico and Kazakhstan.

However, a delay in the recovery of international oilfield development activities has compelled the company to cut its guidance. Hence, it now expects total revenues in the band of $174-$175 million against the prior guided range of $177-$179 million. It now anticipates EPS within 57-58 cents.Core Laboratories’ Reservoir Description unit will bear the brunt of reduced revenues as most (almost 85%) of the segment’s income is based on international activity levels. Delayed activities in the North Sea, Middle East and Asia-Pacific regions as well as the Gulf of Mexico will impact its revenues.Higher ramp-up costs related to deployment of new laboratory technology and infrastructure are also expected to hurt the segment’s operating income.

(NOV  -  Free Report) recently inked a deal to form a joint venture (JV) with Saudi Aramco for manufacturing onshore rigs and equipment in Saudi Arabia. The latest development will brighten prospects of the energy services sector in Saudi Arabia and boost future growth potential of National Oilwell.The JV, which will serve as a major hub for high-specification rigs with breakthrough technologies, aims to construct up to 10 onshore drilling rigs annually. It will also supply advanced drilling equipment, spare parts and packages for jack-up rigs, along with providing repair and maintenance services for the sophisticated drilling technologies.Located at Ras Al Khair on the kingdom’s east coast, the facility will lead to the creation of around 1,000 jobs. While the project is likely to be completed in 2020, the first rig is expected to be delivered in 2021.Houston-based National Oilwell will own 70% stake in the JV and Saudi Arabia’s state-owned oil/gas entity will hold the remaining 30%. The tie-up is also supported by Saudi Aramco’s partnership with Nabors Industries Limited, which has already agreed to purchase 50 onshore rigs over a period of 10 years.

1467,COP,"Recent weeks have seen escalating trade hostility between the United States and China. However, starting this week, corporate earnings, revenues and management outlook will determine the future course of the stock market. Analysts expect a strong Q2 earnings season, after solid jobs data spur a welcome shift in market narrative.Energy players, materials, construction, industrial products, technology and financials are likely to record the highest year-over-year earnings growth. Thus, for the next few weeks, let us keep an eye on stocks from these sectors that are likely to make the most of the Q2 earnings season.Q2 Earnings to See Double-Digit GainsInvestors look forward to the outset of the Q2 earnings season this week, when bigwigs like JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report), Citigroup Inc. (C  -  Free Report) and Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report) will be reporting their Q2 numbers. Notably, for the whole of S&P 500, results are expected to be impressive.Total earnings for the S&P 500 companies are estimated to improve 19% from the same period last year on 8.2% higher revenues. Such an uptick will follow 24.6% earnings growth on 8.7% revenue improvement last quarter, marking the highest growth in almost seven years.The gains are likely to be broad-based, with nearly all the sectors expected to report year-over-year earnings growth, except for autos and conglomerates. Around 11 of these sectors are likely to come up with double-digit growth.What Will Drive Earnings?Earnings are likely to rise mostly on strong economic data. The United States has been able to create 213,000 jobs in June; a sign that corporates are finding ways to fill positions despite the lack of skilled workers. Such upbeat hiring figures breezed past analysts’ estimates of 200,000 job additions.Job gains were pretty broad-based, with white-collar jobs leading the way with 50,000 additions. From manufacturers, health-care providers to construction companies, all hired workers, a clear sign of a burgeoning economy.The unemployment rate rose to 4% last month, but for a good reason. The jobless rate went up mostly because of around 600,000 people entering the labor force. This showed that more Americans are searching for jobs as they are easier to find.The U.S. economy, in the meanwhile, is projected to expand in the second quarter at an annual pace of nearly 4% after a 2.2% gain in the first three months of this year, economists say. This would put the economy in a solid position this year to meet or even beat 3% growth in gross domestic product (GDP), one of the primary aims of the government (read more: US GDP to Hit Elusive 3% Annual Growth in 13 Years: 5 Picks).The recent strength in the economy has offset trade war tensions. Needless to say, the United States and China have imposed tit-for-tat tariffs on each other’s imports, with Beijing accusing the United States for triggering the ‘largest scale trade war’ (read more: Think Small As U.S.-China Trade War Breaks Out! 5 Top Picks).Potential Gainers of Q2The energy sector is poised to record highest earnings growth among all sectors, which is estimated to surge 138.4% from the same period last year on 20.3% higher revenues. Among the sub-sectors, oil and gas exploration and production; oil and gas refining and marketing; oil and gas equipment and services; and oil and gas drilling companies are positioned to report solid growth. A more or less healthy crude pricing scenario and positive free cash flow are primarily fueling the optimism.The materials sector has recently been looking up, with Q2 earnings expected to rise 54% on 24.1% higher revenues. Construction is likely to report the third-highest year-over-year profit growth, with Q2 earnings poised to be up 45% from the same period last year on 22.5% higher revenues.Earnings for the Industrial sector are set to grow 24.5% from the same period last year on 10.9% higher revenues. Firm business investment helped factories expand, while manufacturers are also on a hiring spree and are paying more than other jobs.Q2 earnings for the tech sector are poised to be up 23.8% from the same period last year on 10.7% higher revenues. High profits are also expected from financial segments as well. Total Q2 earnings for the financial sector are projected to rise 18.4% from the same period last year on 3.8% higher revenues. Banks, insurers and asset managers are all expected to report double-digit growth mostly on higher interest rates (read more: Fed Lifts Rates for the Second Time in 2018: Winners & Losers).Buy These 6 Stocks for Stellar Earnings GrowthA very strong economic backdrop looks set to deliver another round of stellar earnings growth in Q2.

1468,COP,"West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude recently touched the $75-a-barrel psychological mark, showing a more than 186% improvement from February 2016 when the commodity had hit its lowest level of $26.21 since 2003. The surge in oil price is definitely a boon for upstream and midstream businesses of integrated energy companies.Healthy crude price will likely convince energy players to ramp up production in domestic shale plays. From storing and transporting new oil volumes, integrated energy firms are expected to get additional fee-based revenues from shippers.Moreover, the abundance of natural gas in the United States following the shale revolution will continue to back the integrated energy firms’ chemical/downstream activities since the players’ petrochemical crackers should benefit from cheaper natural gas feedstocks like ethane instead of naphtha — which is derived from the pricier crude.Industry Rewards Shareholders with Huge ReturnsLooking at shareholder returns over the past year, it appears that the crude price recovery was enough for boosting investors’ confidence in the industry’s prospects. The Zacks Oil & Gas-US Integrated Industry, part of the broader Zacks Oil and Energy Sector, has outperformed both the S&P 500 and its sector over the past year. We can see that stocks in this industry have collectively gained 44.3% over the past year, while the Zacks S&P 500 Composite and Zacks Oil and Energy Sector have rallied a respective 14.2% and 18.7%.One-Year Price PerformancePlenty of Room to RunIn order to determine the value of the oil sector, we have used the trailing 12-month Enterprise Multiple. This is because oil energy players typically shoulder significant debt pertaining to investments in growth projects and EV includes debt for valuing company or industry.Enterprise Multiple = Enterprise Value (EV)/EBITDAThe industry currently has a trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA ratio of 9.09. When compared with the highest level of 10.49 over that period, there is apparently room for more upside.Enterprise Value/EBITDA Ratio (TTM) The space also looks cheap when compared with the market at large, as the trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA ratio for the S&P 500 is 11.48 and the median level is 11.38.  Comparing the group’s EV/EBITDA ratio with that of its broader sector shows that the industry is trading at a considerable premium. In fact, the solid business potential has convinced investors to persistently pay premium for the industry as compared to the broader sector over the past few years.  Enterprise Value/EBITDA Ratio (TTM) Outperformance May Sustain on Strong Earnings OutlookPer our proprietary model, the industry’s trailing 12-month free cashflow as of Dec 31, 2017 was $6.4 billion, significantly up from $542 million in 2016. This reflects that the industry has sufficient cashflow left for financing growth projects without the need to rely on debt and equity capital.Moreover, the industry has considerable lower exposure to debt as compared to the S&P 500. This is reflected in the industry’s debt-to-capitalization ratio of 34.7% against the S&P 500’s 47.2%. Hence, apart from adequate free cashflow, the industry has sufficient space for sponsoring future developments by debt capital if need arises. While the ratio analysis shows that there is a solid value-oriented path ahead, one should not really consider the current price levels as good entry points unless there are convincing reasons to predict a rebound in the near term. One reliable measure that can help investors understand the industry’s prospects for a solid price performance is the earnings outlook for its member companies. Empirical research shows that a company’s earnings outlook significantly influences its stock performance.The Price & Consensus chart for the industry shows the market's evolving bottom-up earnings expectations for it as well as the industry's aggregate stock market performance. The red line in the chart represents the Zacks measure of consensus earnings expectations for 2019 while the light blue line represents the same for 2018.Price and Consensus: Zacks US IntegratedIndustry This becomes clearer by focusing on the aggregate bottom-up EPS revision trend. The chart below shows the evolution of aggregate consensus expectations for 2018.Please note that the $2.69 EPS estimate for the industry for 2018 is not the actual bottom-up dollar estimate for every company within the Zacks Oil & Gas-US Integrated Industry but rather an illustrative aggregate number created by our proprietary analytics model. The key factor to keep in mind is not the industry’s earnings per share for 2018 but how this estimate has evolved recently.Current Fiscal Year EPS Estimate Revisions As you can see here, the $2.69 EPS estimate for 2018 is up from $2.03 at the end of April and 55 cents at the end of August 2017. In other words, the sell-side analysts covering the companies in the Zacks US integrated industry have been steadily raising their estimates.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Solid ProspectsThe group’s Zacks Industry Rank is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all member stocks.The Zacks Oil & Gas-US Integrated Industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #18, placing it in the top 7% of more than 250 Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.On top of that, our proprietary Heat Map shows that the industry’s rank has been in the top 50% for the past eight weeks with an overall steady upward trend.The solid near-term prospects are strengthened further by the recovery in top and bottom lines that integrated energy firms have been showing since the start of 2017.Revenues: Zacks US Integrated IndustryNet Income: Zacks US Integrated IndustryBottom LineProspects for upstream businesses seem promising as the current crude rally is expected to continue on numerous factors.Possibility of higher oil output from Saudi Arabia and Russia will not be able to offset global supply concerns emanating from Venezuela’s supply and Iran’s sanction issues. This is constantly driving WTI crude price. On top of that, a booming domestic economy, as reflected from robust job additions and the increase in labor force participation rate, is fueling the oil rally.  Midstream businesses are also picking up pace given the mounting demand for new pipeline networks in the domestic shale plays. Also, integrated energy firms are investing in petrochemical crackers in the Gulf Coast areas for capitalizing on cheap domestic natural gas feedstocks like ethane.Overall, it seems to be the ideal time to bet on four integrated energy companies with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and positive earnings estimate revisions.ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report): This Houston, TX-based firm has gained 66% over the past year.

1469,COP,"A common investing misconception is that all exploration and production players will gain from the current rally in crude prices. However, all oil plays in the United States are not positioned to capitalize on the recovering commodity.Scenarios have changed as explorers and drillers have redirected their focus to the prolific Eagle Ford and Bakken plays instead of the crowded Permian. With the current crude rally expected to sustain on the back of numerous factors, it would be prudent for investors to place a wager on Eagle Ford and Bakken players.Oil Rally to Carry OnAfter November 2014, WTI crude has again touched the $75-a-barrel psychological mark. The rally will likely continue since oil demand is expected to remain robust amid persistent shrinkage in global supply.Factors to Drive DemandMany analysts believe that the U.S. economy will grow at a healthy pace to support crude demand. According to the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, the gross domestic product (GDP) of the United States will grow at an annualized rate of 4.5% through second-quarter 2018. This is going to mark the highest growth since 2014.In other words, the Fed expects the economy to improve after the first-quarter 2018 slump, when GDP growth rate slipped to 2% from 2.9% in the final three months of 2017. Improved domestic economic growth should drive crude demand.In fact, the global demand for crude is likely to grow 1.4 million barrels per day through 2018, claimed the International Energy Agency.  Factors to Limit Supply The State Department recently announced that the Trump administration wants all companies to stop purchasing Iranian oil starting early November. If this isn’t followed, America will not hesitate to apply sanctions on the firms. Since Iran is the third biggest producer of oil among the OPEC members, supply concern pertaining to Iranian crude is constantly boosting oil prices.Also, Venezuela, touted to be among the biggest oil producers in Latin America, has been witnessing a steep decline in crude production, aggravating crude supply woes. In 2017, Venezuela reported the lowest oil production in a decade.Saudi Arabia Will Outpace Permian Drillers U.S. shale players are exposed to limited short-term domestic production possibilities — especially in the Permian Basin — following pipeline bottleneck problems. It is to be noted that among all the major plays contributing to the record U.S. production levels, the contribution of Permian is the highest.Per BP Capital Fund Advisors, the production in the Permian will outpace the pipeline transportation capacity of the Basin by 300,000 to 400,000 barrels per day (B/D) through 2018. The gap will expand further to 750,000 B/D through 2019, added the investment management firm.Moreover, the number of drilled but uncompleted wells surged by 100 in the Permian Basin through May, reflecting limited production possibilities in the domestic shale plays.On the flip side, Saudi-led OPEC players and Russia agreed in the recent Vienna meet to relax the 18-month production cut deal, thereby increasing production starting Jul 1. Notably, the United States urgently wants Saudi Arabia to raise production to make up for the global crude supply shortage to some extent.Overall, the Sheikhs are positioned to make the most of the oil price rally by ramping up production. Meanwhile, the Permian drillers with limited production possibilities are clearly at a disadvantage.Bet on Bakken & Eagle Ford ExplorersIt is debatable whether Saudi Arabia will be able to outpace all U.S. shale plays in terms of production. However, for the time being, we can focus on some of the promising plays in the United States where most of the drillers have started to gather.U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) predicts new-well oil production per rig from Eagle Ford to increase from 1,470 barrels a day in June to 1,503 barrels in July this year. Also, for Bakken, new-well oil production per rig will likely rise to 1,470 barrels a day in July from 1,463 in June. Meanwhile, in the Permian Basin, EIA expects oil production per rig from new-well in July to total 620 barrels a day, same as the prior month.  Hence, investors who are looking to gain from the bullish crude scenario can bet on stocks with significant exposure to either the prolific Eagle Ford or Bakken play. Since picking winning stocks is not an easy job, we have employed our proprietary Stock Screener to narrow down the search to the following five stocks. The companies either carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Headquartered in Houston, TX, ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report) is focusing more on the Eagle Ford shale play than the crowded Permian Basin, per CEO Ryan Lance.The #1 Ranked company’s prime focus on the Eagle Ford is reflected in the first-quarter 2018 production picture. Through the quarter, the company’s daily oil equivalent production from the Permian Basin was recorded at 19,000 barrels, considerably lower than 163,000 barrels from Eagle Ford. (Read more: ConocoPhillips Chooses Eagle Ford Over Permian: Here's Why).Houston, TX-based Marathon Oil Corporation (MRO  -  Free Report) has extensive acres of resources in the oil-rich Eagle Ford. The Zacks #1 Ranked firm’s year-over-year rise in production, available for sale, in first-quarter 2018 was aided by solid contributions from U.S. resource plays in the Eagle Ford.Formed in 1967, Oklahoma City, OK-based Continental Resources, Inc. (CLR  -  Free Report) has a premier position in the Bakken area. The shale play, which is ranked among the country’s largest onshore oilfields, produces premium quality of crude. In the Bakken, this Zacks Rank #1 company has a working interest in 1,576 net oil producing wells.Whiting Petroleum Corporation (WLL  -  Free Report), headquartered in Denver, CO, operates premium acres in the prolific Bakken play. Being placed among the top oil producers in the Bakken, the Zacks #1 Ranked firm has its most profitable growth projects in the play.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

1470,COP,"Per BP plc’s (BP  -  Free Report) chief operating officer, the company intends to make the Mexican fuel market it’s second largest in the world after the United States.The Mexican fuel market, which was recently liberalized after the law changes, permitted other players to participate except Pemex national oil company. BP was the first foreign oil major to set foot on Mexico's newly liberalized fuel sector.In 2017, BP opened 220 new fuel stations worldwide, of which 130 were in Mexico. By 2021, BP plans to open 1500 sites in the country. The growth will be backed by 10% increase in demand over the next five years. BP’s entry into the Mexican market has been appreciated.However, BP will face several challenges, including the urgent need for new fuel storage and transport infrastructure. Therefore, the company is looking for partners to build infrastructure in the country.BP is among the leading integrated energy players in the world. The company is continuously seeking opportunities to boost return for its shareholders.Ramp up of key upstream projects convinced BP to project higher year-over-year production through 2018. For the January to March quarter of 2018, the integrated energy player expects output to be in line, sequentially. Healthy projected output amid the partial recovery in oil prices might reward the company with handsome cashflows.Price PerformanceDuring the last three months, BP’s shares have lost 0.5% compared with the industry’s 1.9 decline. Zacks Rank & Key PicksBP carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked players in the same sector are Occidental Petroleum Corporation (OXY  -  Free Report), Pioneer Natural Resources Company (PXD  -  Free Report) and ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report).

1471,COP,"YPF Sociedad Anonima (YPF  -  Free Report), an Argentine state-run energy company foresees its shale production to rise 35% this year as the cost of production in the Vaca Muerta shale play continues to fall, where the company recently completed drilling its first 3,200 meters long lateral well.Following the last year's decline of 5.3% output from mature fields in the Vaca Muerta shale, production there is expected to fall 2-3% more in 2018. The company’s total production in the year declined from 577.4 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (Kboed) in 2016 to 555 Kboed in 2017.To counter the situation, YPF wants to drill 100 new wells in 12 distinct regions of Vaca Muerta shale play this year. The company expects the increase in production from the shale play to more than offset the declining output from the matured fields in 2018.The production ramp up will be supported by declined drilling costs for horizontal wells in the region. The cost was $3,050 per lateral foot in 2015 and $2,270 in 2016. In the fourth quarter of 2017, the cost fell more amounting to $1,390 per lateral foot.

1472,COP,"ExxonMobil Corporation (XOM  -  Free Report) has outlined its growth strategy, which intends to more than double earnings and cash flow from operations by 2025 based on current oil prices.Per the growth plans, the company expects earnings of $31 billion by 2025, up more than 100% from last year’s adjusted profit of $15 billion. The figure does not include the impact of U.S. tax reform and impairments.ExxonMobil has set capital spending at $24 billion for 2018, $28 billion for 2019 and $30 billion from 2023 to 2025, to meet its target to achieve high growth. However, its peers including Chevron Corporation (CVX  -  Free Report) are cutting down on spending and keeping budgets unchanged.Darren W. Woods, chairman and chief executive officer of ExxonMobil, also emphasized that the plan estimates double-digit rates of return in all three segments of ExxonMobil’s business — upstream, downstream and chemical.Upstream Growth Drivers: Guyana and the PermianExxonMobil expects to enhance earnings in the upstream sector by initiating various growth programs, including low-cost-of-supply investments in U.S. tight oil, deepwater and liquefied natural gas (LNG). Moreover, ramp up of existing projects and commissioning of around 25 new projects are likely to boost yield to about 5 million oil-equivalent barrels per day (MMBOE/D), up from 4 MMBOE/D. The company proposes to boost tight-oil production by five times from the U.S. Permian Basin. It also intends to increase LNG production to meet the growing demand worldwide.ExxonMobil’s exploration successes and strategic acquisitions will benefit upstream growth. The testimony to this is the addition of 10 billion oil-equivalent barrels to its resource base in locations including the Permian, Guyana, Mozambique, Papua New Guinea and Brazil, in 2017.Guyana and the Permian are key drivers of growth in ExxonMobil’s portfolio. In Guyana, the company has added 3.2 billion gross oil equivalent barrels of recoverable resource and plans development and exploration. In the Permian, the company expanded resource base to 9.5 billion oil-equivalent barrels from less than 3 billion in 2016. This was possible mainly because of acquisition of several entities in 2017 along with application of its expertise in technical evaluation and successful delineation. ExxonMobil managed to lower the acquisition cost to just above $1 per oil-equivalent barrel.The New Mexico acquisition is estimated to hold over 4,800 drilling locations with an average lateral length of more than 12,000 feet. This will facilitate efficiency in execution of Permian volumes growth and enhance growth.Downstream Growth Backed by Investing in RefineriesThe earnings of downstream business of ExxonMobil are expected to increase two fold by 2025. The growth will come through strategic investments that will include upgradation at refineries in Baytown and Beaumont in Texas and Baton Rouge, Louisiana, Rotterdam, Antwerp, Singapore, and Fawley in the U.K. The investments will boost yield of higher-value products — ultra-low sulfur diesel, chemicals feedstocks and basestocks for lubricants. These initiatives will lead the downstream margins to increase 20% through 2025.The projected demand growth in the emerging markets will support the expansion. ExxonMobil is also venturing into new markets such as Mexico and Indonesia. Moreover, integration with chemical manufacturing and upstream production also support growth.Chemical Segment to Increase Presence in America & Asia PacificIn its chemical business, ExxonMobil is likely to increase manufacturing capacity in North America and Asia Pacific by about 40%. The probable growth can be attributed to the addition of 13 new facilities, comprising two world-class steam crackers in the United States. These investments will facilitate the company to meet rising demand in Asia and other emerging markets.ConclusionOverall, ExxonMobil’s growth strategy aims to fully leverage competitive advantages to boost shareholder value in three of its world-class businesses. The increased investments are expected to enhance and boost returns on capital employed to about 15% by 2025.However, many analysts view the long-term goals of ExxonMobil as complex, thanks to the uncertainty in the oil and gas industry over the last few years. Shares of the company dropped 2.5% after the company announced that spending will not enhance near-term production.Price PerformanceDuring the last three months, ExxonMobil’s shares have lost 10.1% compared with the industry’s 0.8% decline. Zacks Rank & Key PicksExxonMobil carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked players in the same sector are Pioneer Natural Resources Company (PXD  -  Free Report) and ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report).

1474,COP,"ExxonMobil Corporation (XOM  -  Free Report) and Synthetic Genomics Inc. have initiated a new phase in their joint algae biofuel research program. Through the study, the company intends 10,000 barrels of algae biofuel per day by 2025.ExxonMobil’s assumption is based on the research carried out till date and emerging technical capability. To progress toward large-scale production, extra work is required. As the study advances, the companies continue to perform basic research on algae biology in their laboratories.The scope of the new phase comprises an outdoor field study that will raise naturally occurring algae in numerous contained ponds in California. Better understanding of the fundamental engineering parameters including viscosity and flow will be facilitated from the research. These parameters are difficult to imitate in a lab. The potential commercial deployment of this technology largely depends on the outcome of this research.Subsequent to the companies’ years of fundamental biological research into accepting and enhancing algae oil production, outdoor research will follow.ExxonMobil and Synthetic Genomics have been researching jointly since 2009 to develop oil from algae that could be substituted as a renewable, lower-emission fuel to traditional transportation ones.ExxonMobil also partnered with universities, government laboratories and other companies to perform a wide range of research on advanced biofuels.In 2017, ExxonMobil and Synthetic Genomics got a breakthrough research published in Nature Biotechnology that lead to a modified algae strain which more than doubled oil content without considerably restraining growth, a key challenge along the path to commercial scalability.Transportation-related global energy demand is estimated to grow about 25% through 2040. Thereby, a cut in emissions from the transportation sector will play a significant role in reducing global greenhouse gas release.Additionally, other researches by ExxonMobil include emission-reducing technologies, including carbon capture and sequestration. The company has invested about $8 billion since 2000 to build and deploy lower-emission energy solutions in its operations.Price PerformanceDuring the last three months, ExxonMobil’s shares have lost 7.7% compared with the industry’s 1.1% decline. Zacks Rank & Key PicksExxonMobil carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked players in the same sector are Occidental Petroleum Corp.

1476,COP,"On Mar 6, BP plc (BP  -  Free Report) was raised to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Why the Upgrade?Through 2017, BP brought online seven key projects — Khazzan Phase 1, Zohr, Juniper, Persephone, Quad 204, Trinidad Onshore Compression and West Nile Delta - Taurus / Libra — which helped the firm produce record volumes of oil and gas during the October-to-December quarter. In fact, fourth-quarter 2017 production touched the highest mark since the January-to-March quarter of 2011.BP is also expected to bring online five more upstream developments in 2018. All these projects along with the developments placed online in 2016 will likely help the energy giant add 800,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day to net production capacity by 2020.Investors should know that ramp up of key upstream projects convinced BP to project higher year-over-year production through 2018. For the January-to-March quarter of 2018, the integrated energy player expects output to remain flat sequentially. Healthy projected output amid the partial recovery in oil price might reward the company with handsome cashflow.BP has been paying stable dividends to American Depositary Share (ADS) holders for 13 quarters in a row despite volatile crude prices. ADS holders will again receive dividend payments on Mar 29, 2018, as announced by the company along with its fourth-quarter 2017 results, the quantum of which has been maintained.

1478,COP,"ExxonMobil Corporation (XOM  -  Free Report) along with other oil majors — Total SA (TOT  -  Free Report) and Repsol — have submitted bids for oil and gas exploration off Greece.One consortium comprises ExxonMobil (holding 40%), Total (40%) and Hellenic Petroleum. The second consortium comprises Spain’s Repsol and Hellenic Petroleum. The first consortium submitted a bid to jointly explore off Crete, while the other consortium intends to commence exploration in a block in the Ionian Sea.The tenders were launched in 2017 after expressions of interest were received from the ExxonMobil-led consortium for the two sites off Crete and from Greece's Energean for the Ionian block. However, Energean has backed out since then.Subject to final approval by the Energy Ministry, Hellenic Hydrocarbons Resources Management (HHRM) will immediately appraise the offers. The large finds in eastern Mediterranean has motivated Greece to seek investment in its energy sector as it makes an effort to recover from years of economic crisis.Western Greece is largely unexplored and not much information relating to its hydrocarbon potential is available.

At this stage, investment in S&P 500 stocks with favorable Zacks Rank and significant growth potential will be a prudent move.U.S. Economy Remains HealthyThe U.S. economic growth is at its sturdiest since recession. On Jun 13, the Fed raised forecast for 2018 GDP growth from 2.7% in March to 2.8%. The primary catalyst behind these positive revisions is obviously the direct impact of the tax cuts. The corporate tax rate was recently lowered from 35% to 21%. Moreover, repatriation of income will be taxed 8% to 15.5%, instead of the current 35%.Strong Labor MarketOn Jun 1, the Department of Labor reported that the U.S. economy added 223,000 jobs in May, exceeding the consensus estimate of 190,000.

Notably, readings over 50% indicate more companies are expanding instead of shrinking.Robust Earnings Momentum   Second-quarter earnings results have been exhibiting strong momentum so far.

It is to be noted that the first quarter witnessed the highest quarterly earnings growth pace in seven years.

1484,COP,"On Jun 29, oil prices rose for the fourth consecutive day in anticipation of an increase in demand against disruptions in supply. WTI crude jumped almost 1% on Friday to end at $74.15, it highest closing since Nov 2014.The rise marks robust weekly, monthly, quarterly and half-yearly gains. Oil prices have been increasing after the United States imposed sanctions on Iran to stop exporting oil from that country in order to cut off substantial finances.A multitude of factors are raising the specter of supply shortages at a time when global demand could rise exponentially. Against this backdrop, it makes sense to bet on select oil stocks likely to deliver strong profits in the second half of 2018.Trump Further Closes in on IranIn May, President Donald Trump withdrew from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal and imposed sanctions on that country. This immediately led to fears of a rise in oil price. Imposition of sanctions means Iran could cut down on its oil production thus impacting oil exports.  Moreover, according to reports, the United States is urging other countries to stop importing oil from Iran by Nov 4. This is part of the President’s efforts to isolate Iran economically and politically, per a senior U.S. State Department official.Big Challenge for Other OPEC Members The United States’ sanction on Iran comes with expectations that other members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) including Russia will make up for the shortage in oil supply. The OPEC members have promised to raise oil production but it is unlikely that they will be able to achieve the supply target.However, concerns have emerged over Saudi Arabia’s ability to step up production at a pace quick enough to combat supply shortages. And even if Saudi Arabia does pump oil at an all-time high level, it will cross its production quota and place the excess in storage. This in all likelihood will only move oil prices higher.Libya, Venezuela Crude Supplies Deepen CrisisUnited States’ sanctions on Venezuela coupled with that country’s ongoing economic crisis have been the key concerns of late. Venezuela is embroiled in an oil supply crisis and is entering a dangerous new phase. According to reports, Venezuela is shutting oil production to cope with nearly replete terminal shortage that is resulting in a decline in output.Libya, on the other hand, has added to supply bottlenecks. According to a report from Reuters, forces led by Eastern Libya’s military commander Khalifa Haftar have handed over control of the country’s eastern oil ports to a National Oil Corporation (NOC) based in the east. The internationally recognized NOC has dismissed the move, terming it as illegal.  Our ChoicesMultiple supply concerns are serving to boost crude prices at this moment. The supply crisis has been aggravated after the United States recently told that it would sanction those countries that do not reduce their crude imports from Iran to “zero” by Nov 4. This tough stance on Iranian imports could lead to prolonged supply concerns.Moreover, the situation in Libya and Venezuela remains unpredictable. Meanwhile, questions have been raised on Saudi Arabia’s ability to boost production quickly.  Investing in stocks of oil companies looks like a smart option at this point. However, picking winning stocks may be difficult.This is where our VGM Score comes in. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores. Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners. However, it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM Score. We have narrowed down our search to the following stocks, each of which has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and a good VGM Score.

1485,COP,"On Jun 26, ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report) was upgraded to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Factors of the UpgradeThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 earnings per share has been revised upward from $3.83 to $4.11 over the last 30 days. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 earnings rose to $4.27 from $3.96 over the same time frame. This adds to the company’s already impressive earnings profile. ConocoPhillips has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four quarters, the average positive surprise being 226.9%.We expect the company to record earnings growth of 585% and 4% in 2018 and 2019, respectively.In terms of production and proved reserves, ConocoPhillips is the largest exploration and production player in the world. Also, the company’s upstream activities, spread across 17 countries, reflect its diversified operations. Moreover, ConocoPhillips’ focus to increase production from the more profitable unconventional resources through 2020 is expected to boost cashflow.It is to be noted that ConocoPhillips’ first-quarter 2018 production comprised of roughly 50% oil. The ‘oilier’ nature of its volume mix positions it well to benefit from strengthening oil prices.On top of that, ConocoPhillips has strong commitment to return cash to shareholders through dividend payments and share buybacks. The oil and gas explorer recently hiked the quarterly dividend payout by 7.5%. The company also boosted its strategic stock repurchase program through 2018 by 33%.All these developments are reflected in ConocoPhillips’ impressive pricing chart. Over the past year, the stock has rallied 56.4%, outperforming the 41.2% collective gain of the stocks belonging to the industry.Other Stocks to ConsiderOther prospective players in the energy space include Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (APC  -  Free Report), Eclipse Resources Corporation (ECR  -  Free Report) and Chevron Corporation (CVX  -  Free Report).

1486,COP,"On Jun 26, U.S. crude price moved above $70 for the first time in more than a month. Several factors contributed to this increase, though all of them emanated from supply concerns. Reports emerged that the United States is urging countries to stop importing oil from Iran by November. Meanwhile, uncertainty hovered over the fate of Libyan crude supplies.Further, concerns have emerged over Saudi Arabia’s ability to step up production at a pace quick enough to combat supply shortages. The temporary closure of a production facility in Canada also served to boost U.S. prices. With no end to the sector’s supply concerns in sight, investing in oil stocks looks like a profitable option.Iran, Libya Crude Supplies Under CloudOn Tuesday, WTI crude increased 3.6% to close at $70.53 a barrel, the highest finish recorded since May 24. Brent crude also gained 2.1% to close at $76.31 a barrel, a near two-week high. Such gains came on the back of multiple factors boosting supply concerns.According to a report by The Wall Street Journal, the United States wants all countries to stop importing oil from Iran by Nov 4. This is part of the United States’ efforts to isolate the country economically and politically, per a senior U.S. State Department official.Major purchasers of Iranian crude were expecting the United States to allow them to reduce such oil imports over an extended period. But the Trump administration has no plans of issuing any waivers for countries that are making efforts to cut Iranian oil imports.Meanwhile, a cloud is hovering over Libyan crude supplies. According to a report from Reuters, forces led by Eastern Libya’s military commander Khalifa Haftar have handed over control of the country’s eastern oil ports to a National Oil Corporation (NOC) based in the east. The internationally recognized NOC has dismissed the move, terming it as illegal.Saudi Concerns, Syncrude Breakdown Boost PricesAccording to Bloomberg, Saudi Arabia is preparing to boost crude production to a record level in July. The oil-rich country plans to produce 10.8 million barrels a day starting next month, which exceeds the earlier all-time high of 10.72 million barrels a day recorded in November 2016. The move would be in accordance with the recent agreement concluded between OPEC and its allies.But analysts feel that this report implies that oil prices can only move higher. If Saudi Arabia does pump oil at an all-time high level, it will cross its production quota and place the excess in storage.However, such a move comes at a time when global spare production capacity is languishing near all-time lows. This means that the country may not be confident enough about boosting production at a pace that is enough to make up for a likely shortfall.Also boosting oil prices on Tuesday was the temporary closure of Canada-based oil-sands facility Syncrude. Loss of power led to a shutdown on Jun 20 and even though power has been restored since then, no shipments have been forthcoming as of now. Since the facility produces 360,000 barrels of crude a day, the disruption has also contributed to the spike in oil prices.Our ChoicesMultiple supply concerns are serving to boost crude prices at this moment. While temporary disruptions like Syncrude are unlikely to leave a long-term impact, the United States’ tough stance on Iranian imports could lead to prolonged supply concerns.The situation in Libya is also likely to remain unpredictable. Meanwhile, questions surround Saudi Arabia’s ability to boost production quickly.  Investing in stocks of oil companies looks like a smart option at this point.

1487,COP,"Earnings growth and valuation multiples are indeed important for investors to determine a stock's ability to offer considerable returns. But these are also essential in determining whether a stock’s price performance is better than its peers or the industry average.If the stock’s performance is lacking that of the broader groups despite impressive earnings growth or valuation multiples, then something must be wrong.It’s always advisable to stay away from these stocks and bet on those that are outperforming their respective industries or benchmarks. This is because betting on a winner always increases the odds of winning.Then again, it is imperative that you determine whether or not an investment has relevant upside potential when considering stocks with significant relative price strength. Stocks delivering better than the S&P 500 over a period of 1 to 3 months at the least and having solid fundamentals indicate room for growth and are the best ways to go about this strategy.Finally, it is important to find out whether analysts are optimistic about the upcoming earnings results of these companies.

1489,COP,"The OPEC countries have agreed to raise crude oil production but by an amount that appears to be less than market expectations. Such a lesser-than-expected production boost helped oil prices scale north and energy shares end in the green.Oil prices are expected to climb further in the years ahead as there is a cap on how much Saudi Arabia can produce and it is near the limit. Also, Venezuela’s crude oil output has declined significantly. Meanwhile, production of shale, a substitute for conventional crude oil, has risen by leaps and bounds over the past 10 years.Banking on this strength in oil prices, investing in sound energy stocks seems prudent.OPEC Agrees to Smaller-Than-Expected Production OPEC has decided to raise production; however, the amount seems to be lesser than analysts’ expectations. This has soothed concerns about a crude supply glut in the market. So, how did OPEC react? It said that it would “strive to adhere to the overall conformity level of OPEC-12, down to 100%, as of 1 July 2018”.The statement clearly means that under the deal inked in November 2016, 12 of the 14 OPEC members at that time agreed to trim output by 1.2 million barrels a day from late-2016 levels. But, it had cut down more than required, resulting in excess output reduction of nearly 624,000 barrels a day. The OPEC members, thus, have now decided to add 624,000 barrels a day into the global market and get back to 100% compliance.Such an uptick in output, nonetheless, turns out to be less than a likely increase in production by 1 million barrels a day, according to Khalid al-Falih, Saudi Arabia’s energy minister. Nigerian oil minister Ibe Kachikwu added that 1 million-barrel figure would have seen OPEC increasing output by around 700,000 barrels a day, while non-OPEC countries including Russia contributing the rest, according to the Financial Times.How Did Oil Prices React?OPEC’s agreement to smaller-than-expected production boost amid a global supply glut helped oil prices scale north. The West Texas Intermediate crude, the U.S. benchmark traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange, jumped by $3.04, or 4.4%, to settle at $68.58 a barrel on Jun 22, its highest finish in nearly a month. The West Texas Intermediate crude finished roughly 5.8% higher last week.The Brent crude, the global benchmark jumped $2.50, or 3.3%, to reach $75.55 a barrel, rebounding from the prior trading session’s finish at $73.05, which was the lowest for the international benchmark since Apr 17. The Brent crude posted a weekly rise of almost 2.9%.(Source: oil-price.net)Factors Beyond OPEC Will Drive Oil PricesOil prices, in the meanwhile, are expected to rise as supply growth could face constraints in the near term due to chronic underinvestment in long-term projects by major oil companies in the last three years. And if Saudi Arabia’s intention to increase production level is a concern, one should remember that there is a cap on how much it can produce.Venezuela’s production level has also gone from bad to worse in the past two months. The country’s output levels have dropped to 1.36 million barrels a day last month, down 600,000 barrels a day from a year ago. The International Energy Agency, in fact, has predicted that the country’s output could fall further to 800,000 barrels per day next year.By the way, there are chances of a sharp rise in the production of “tight-oil” from shale rocks in the United States. Tight oil production is, currently, at 5 million barrels a day and will propel total U.S. oil output to over 11 million barrels a day, the highest in about 50 years. This is making the United States a significant exporter and in turn will absorb much of the projected growth in demand. Kuwait, Iraq and Iran, in particular, will thus be forced to dump the idea of increasing oil output in the future. Needless to say, shale production in itself is troublemaking for crude oil.   5 Top Energy Players to Buy NowShares of oil and gas companies have moved north on the back of a strong rally in oil prices.

1490,COP,"Companies with favorable efficiency levels are likely to be on investors’ radar irrespective of market conditions. After all, efficiency is a potential indicator of a company’s financial health.Moreover, a company with a favorable efficiency level is expected to provide impressive returns as it is believed to be positively correlated with its price performance.How to Measure Efficiency? We have considered four popular ratios in order to find efficient companies that have the potential to provide impressive returns.Inventory TurnoverInventory level is one of the key indicators of a company’s business health. While a high inventory level may indicate that the company is going through a rough patch in terms of sales, a dwindling level may indicate that it will run out of stock in a favorable sales condition. This is where inventory turnover comes into play. It is the ratio of 12-month cost of goods sold (COGS) to a 4-quarter average inventory. Thus, a high value of the ratio indicates a low level of inventory relative to COGS, while a low ratio signals that the company has excess inventory.Receivables TurnoverThis ratio is used to measure a company’s capability to extend its credit and collect debts on the basis of that credit. Receivables turnover ratio or the “accounts receivable turnover ratio” or the “debtor’s turnover ratio” is calculated by dividing 12-month sales by four-quarter average receivables. While a high ratio indicates that the company efficiently collects its accounts receivables or has quality customers, a low ratio signals that the company has an inefficient collection procedure or has low-quality customers or an inefficient credit policy.Asset UtilizationThis is a widely used measure of a company’s efficiency. Asset utilization indicates a company’s potential to utilize its assets. It is a ratio of total sales over the past 12 months to the last 4-quarter average of total assets. So, the higher the ratio, the greater is the chance of the company utilizing its assets efficiently. On the contrary, a low value of the ratio signals that it is failing to use its assets effectively.Operating MarginAnother popular efficiency ratio is operating margin. Operating profit margin, which is simply operating income over the past 12 months divided by sales over the same period, indicates how well a company is controlling its operating expenses. If a company has a high operating profit margin in relation to its competitors, it is doing a better job at controlling operating expenses.All these ratios can be considered as effective measures if one compares different companies within a particular sector or industry. This is the reason why we have considered only those companies that have higher ratios than their respective industry averages.Screening ParametersIn addition to the abovementioned ratios, we have added a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) to the screen with an objective to make this strategy more profitable. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Inventory Turnover, Receivables Turnover, Asset Utilization and Operating Margin greater than industry average (Values of these ratios higher than industry averages may indicate that the efficiency level of the company is higher than its peers.)    The use of these few criteria has narrowed down the universe of over 7,906 stocks to only 19.Here are four stocks from the 19 that made it through the screen:Illumina, Inc.

1491,COP,"On Jun 22, a congregation of OPEC (Oil and Petroleum Exporting Countries) countries and non- OPEC allies will assemble in Vienna to take a decision regarding an 18-month old agreement to curb output in order to support global oil prices.Notably, Saudi Arabia and Russia are extremely eager to dissolve the production barrier. However, some OPEC members, especially Iran, Iraq, Venezuela and Iraq are in favor of maintaining status quo.Supply Concerns of Iran and VenezuelaIssues related to Iran stem from the United States’ withdrawal from the nuclear pact and plans of re-imposing sanctions the country. Iran currently exports around 2.5 million barrels of oil a day, reflecting around 4% of world’s total supply. The U.S. sanctions will reduce its oil export to around 1 million barrels per day.Meanwhile, Venezuela is plagued with economic instability, massive debt load, unrest in the workforce and hyperinflation. These factors are likely to take severe toll on the country’s oil production till the end of 2018. In fact, oil exploration has reached at its lowest level in 30 years and is far below the level of strategic cuts required by the OPEC.These two major oil exporters and some other oil countries suffering production inefficiencies like Iraq are vehemently opposing the removal of output restrictions. More oil production means lower oil prices. This implies that the oil revenues of Iran and Venezuela will be hurt significantly. Consequently, this will hamper the economic well-being of these countries.Saudi Arabia and Russia to Increase Oil ProductionsThe two global oil behemoths both in terms of oil reserve and export, Saudi Arabia and Russia, are in favor of elimination of output restrictions even if that means lower oil prices. These two countries want to increase oil supply by 1.5 million-barrels-a-day. These two countries can easily ramp up oil production and increase revenues through higher volume sales by gaining market share from other OPEC and non-OPEC partners.However, an anonymous OPEC source has hinted that OPEC and Russia will finally opt for a compromise which will result in an increase of oil supply 300,000 to 600,000 barrels a day, much lower than 1.5 million barrels a day.Likely Effect on U.S. Oil CompaniesSeveral industry experts firmly believe that OPEC will only compensate the shortage originating from Venezuela or Iran and some other countries. However, the largest oil production cartel will keep international oil production levels intact.Higher oil prices will be major boon for the U.S. oil exploration industry. The U.S. shale production of crude oil is currently going on in full swing. Crude oil production touched a new weekly high of 10.8 million barrels a day and is poised to hit 12 million barrels a day in 2019 making United States the world’s largest crude oil producer.  Although China has imposed tariffs on U.S. crude, strong global demand for oil will enable the United States to seek out a substitute for China which accounts for 20% of U.S. oil exports. Higher oil price and higher volume sales will significantly increase revenues of oil majors.Major beneficiaries will be  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM  -  Free Report), Chevron Corp. (CVX  -  Free Report), Occidental Petroleum Corp. (OXY  -  Free Report) and ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report) to name a few. Chevron and Occidental carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The chart below depicts price performance of above-mentioned four stocks in the last three months.Bottom LineThe U.S. stock markets are facing severe volatility in 2018 primarily due to concern about global trade war, geopolitical conflicts and inflationary fears. Notably, the technology and energy are the two sectors which are providing stability to market fluctuations. However, the tech sector by its nature depends on successful new product innovation while energy sector has a stable footing. Consequently, oil price surge may act as a major catalyst to bring back sustained market momentum.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

1493,COP,"Lilis Energy, Inc. (LLEX  -  Free Report) recently entered into an acreage swap transaction in a bid to upgrade its portfolio in the Permian Basin. The pure-play Permian operator is set to trade its non-operated holdings with 1,500 acres of West Texas land in the Delaware Basin. The company, with which it has entered into the swap deal, has not been undisclosed yet. Subject to satisfactory closing conditions, the deal is set for closure by the end of July.The acquired acreage located in Winkler and Loving counties of West Texas will add more than 100 operated locations in its core holdings in the Wolfcamp and Bone Spring zones; thereby boosting the company’s working interest in the Delaware Basin by about 35%. The Houston-based upstream player will hold more than 19,000 acres in the prolific Delaware Basin. The deal will lead to immediate increase in its proved developed and undeveloped reserves.The company expects the added assets to be highly accretive and support long-lateral developments. The transaction advances the company closer to its 2018 production target of 7,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day, which it now expects to surpass before the year-end.Lilis Energy has been working to boost its acreage in the lucrative Delaware basin since quite some time. In March 2018, it closed a $65 million acquisition that added around 2,798 acres to its core holdings.

1496,COP,"In a bid to deepen its focus on U.S. shale plays, Marathon Oil (MRO  -  Free Report) recently offloaded its oil acreage in Libya to France-based supermajor TOTAL S.A. (TOT  -  Free Report). This development marks the exit of Marathon Oil from Libya.Deal HighlightsPer the deal, Marathon Oil divested 16.3% interest in the Waha acreage in Libya. Other partners in Waha concessions include Libya’s national oil company with 60% stake, along with ConocoPhillips and Hess Corp. with 16.3% and 8.2% stake, respectively. At the end of 2017, Marathon Oil held 199 million barrels of oil equivalent (boe) of proved reserves in Libya.The divestment deal was valued at $450 million.Marathon Oil on a Divestment SpreeIn the last couple of years, the Texas-based energy explorer has inked several deals to sell non-core assets that do not fit into the company’s long-term growth plan. In August 2015, the company divested its Wilburton, OK assets for an amount of $102 million. In November 2015, Marathon Oil jettisoned Gulf of Mexico (GoM) assets for a total price of $205 million.In April 2016, the company inked a deal to divest its Wyoming upstream and midstream assets to Merit Energy for $950 million. Further, in October 2016, the upstream player signed a deal to sell some of its non-core assets in West Texas and New Mexico for $235 million. Additionally, in March 2017, the company exited the high-cost Canadian oil-sands operations for $2.5 billion.In fact, over the last two years, the company has garnered proceeds of over $4 billion from its divestment deals. Notably, Marathon Oil has made an exit from seven countries since 2013.Deal RationaleThe recent divestment of Libyan holdings is just another move by Marathon Petroleum to further streamline its portfolio. Over the last two years, the company has successfully positioned itself into the Delaware Basin and low cost-high margin STACK/SCOOP resource plays while exiting non-core property assets with limited upside.In fact, driven by the key low cost-high margin U.S. resource shales including Permian, Eagle Ford and Bakken, Marathon Oil has projected an increase of 18% in its total production for 2018. The company announced a 2018 capital program of $2,300 million, with around 95% of the outlay earmarked for high return U.S. resource plays.Also, the deal is in sync with the company’s focus to boost its financials. In the recent earnings release, the company restated its commitment toward strengthening its balance sheet and driving cash flows. With $450 million coming in from the latest divestment, along with the remaining proceeds from the sale of Canadian oil-sands business, Marathon Oil is set for a robust cash influx in the coming quarter. This will also position the company to tap on strategic growth opportunities through bolt-on acquisitions.  Moreover, Marathon Oil has been bearing the brunt of stuttering operations in Libya amid political instability and conflicts in the region. Production from the region once accounted for over 11% of the company’s total oil and gas output. However, amid the political and security scenario, the company’s operations in the region had become uncertain and consequently the output was declining. As such, Marathon Oil generated little cash flow from the region in comparison with the rest of its portfolio.Nevertheless, TOTAL — having operated in Libya for nearly 65 years — looks better positioned to handle the political uncertainty of the region.

The decline was led by planned divestment of assets.Price RealizationAverage realized price for oil was $58.99 a barrel, up from $47.05 in the year-earlier quarter.

1501,COP,"After several delays and months of negotiations, SeaDrill Limited  recently announced final restructuring agreement on Feb 26, post which shares of the company rose 10.27% to eventually close at 29 cents.  However, shares scaled down more than 6.8% to close at 27 cents on Feb 27.Being one of the worst sufferers of the downturn and burdened with massive debt, the company had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Sep 12 to restructure its balance sheet amid volatile oil prices. SeaDrill’s Chapter 11 filing was just another disruption in the offshore drilling industry. Many offshore drilling companies like Ocean Rig UDW LLC., Paragon Offshore, Hercules Offshore, Inc. and Vantage Drilling Company had also filed for bankruptcy protection amid declining oil prices.The prior restructuring agreement of Seadrill (on Sep 12) had received support from 97% secured bank lenders and 40% of bondholders, with the company planning to raise $1.06 billion of fresh capital.However, after reaching a global settlement in the Chapter 11 proceedings recently, the restructuring agreement now has the support of 99% secured bank lenders and 70% bondholders. The international offshore drilling company will now witness capital injection of $1.08 billion, which would comprise $880 million of secured loans and $200 million equity. Existing shareholders will receive 1.9% stake in the post-restructuring equity.Notably, the company has been facing pressure in its top line owing to idle rigs and lower day rates. SeaDrill’s earnings have also been declining over the last five quarters on higher costs and low revenues. However, the restructuring agreement is likely to improve the liquidity position of the company and will provide growth opportunities. SeaDrill, which has one of the youngest and most advanced drilling fleets will be poised to secure more contracts post the restructuring, helping the company to stabilize revenues.Zacks Rank and Key PicksSeaDrill carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Shares of the company have lost more than 84% over the year, underperforming the broader industry’s decline of 29%.  In fact, the Oil-Gas Drilling industry has been one of the worst sufferers of the downturn, ranking in the bottom 16% of the Zacks classified industries (223 out of 256). Given the bearish numbers, it shouldn't come as a surprise that most of the companies from this space are likely to underperform the market in the near term.However, a few better-ranked players from the broader energy space include Marathon Petroleum Corporation (MPC  -  Free Report), ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report) and Statoil ASA , each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Marathon Petroleum reported an average positive earnings surprise of 182.62% in the trailing four quarters.ConocoPhillips delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 144.45% in the last four quarters.Statoil reported an average positive earnings surprise of 23.18% in the trailing four quarters.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

1505,COP,"U.S. stock markets rebounded on Thursday buoyed by strong performance of technology sector with several tech behemoths closing at record levels. Yesterday’s broad-based market rally pushed all three major stock indexes to close in the green while Nasdaq finished at a record-high. Moreover, trade war fears evaporated for the time being as the news of a possible negotiation between the United States and China surfaced.   The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) closed at 24,924.89, increasing 0.9% or 224.44 points. The S&P 500 Index (INX) also advanced 0.9% to close at 2,798.29. The Nasdaq Composite Index (IXIC) closed at 7,823.92, gaining 1.4% or 107.31 points.

Notably, 25 of the 30-stock index closed in the green while 5 traded in the red.The S&P 500 increased 0.9% led by 1.6% gain in both Technology Select Sector SPDR (XLK) and Communication Services Select Sector SPDR (XLC), 1.2% rise in Industrials Select Sector SPDR (XLI) and 1.1% increase in Heath Care Select Sector SPDR (XLV). Notably, ten out of 11 sectors of the benchmark index ended in positive territory.Nasdaq Composite posted a big gain of 1.4% which enabled the tech-laden index to post first record-high level close since Jun 20.Technology Stocks Lead Market Rally On Jul 12, Wall Street witnessed strong showing of technology sector, primarily due to market expectations that this sector will be least affected by the second round of tariffs worth $200 billion which the Trump administration has decided to levy on Chinese imports. Consequently, Technology Select Sector SPDR (XLK) achieved its biggest one-day percentage gain since Jun 1.Several tech giants like Facebook Inc. (FB  -  Free Report), Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report), Microsoft Corp. (MSFT  -  Free Report) and Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL  -  Free Report) were up 2.2%, 2.4%, 2.2% and 2.5%, respectively.

Notably, China is yet to retaliate against a massive $200 billion of tariffs that the Trump administration has decided to impose on its exports.Economic DataThe Labor Department reported that initial claims for state unemployment benefits declined 18,000 to a seasonally adjusted 214,000 for the week ended July 7.

The June reading reflects an increase of 2.9% year-over-year, the biggest gain of CPI since February 2012.

1506,COP,"It’s earnings time again and investors are back to watching the quarterly releases closely. This time as well, we expect the Energy sector to contribute the maximum to earnings growth for the S&P 500.Our proprietary data shows that through the April to June quarter of 2018, Energy will generate $19.5 billion in earnings, significantly higher than the last four quarters.Overall, the sector seems profitable with sufficient free cashflows to fund growth projects. Since the recovering crude price is constantly backing Energy, it will be wise to include the ‘oilier’ stocks in one’s portfolio.Crude Price Surges in Q2Per the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), the average West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude prices for the month of April, May and June of 2018 was recorded at a respective $66.25 per barrel, $69.98 and $67.87, significantly higher than the year-ago monthly prices of $51.06, $48.48 and $45.18.Notably, the average monthly crude pricing scenario through second-quarter 2018 was the healthiest in three years. Supply concerns emanating from Venezuela and Iran amid robust domestic economy were constantly backing oil prices.Energy Sector to Witness Highest Earnings GrowthHealthy oil price will likely be the prime factor driving the Energy sector in Q2. Among all the Zacks sectors defining the S&P 500, Energy is expected to be the only sector to witness triple digit year-over-year earnings growth of 139.7% in Q2. Importantly, excluding Energy, the S&P 500’s earnings growth in Q2 will likely drop to 15.7% from 19.1%.  It is evident that the recovering oil price, after the commodity hit its lowest level of $26.21 since 2003 in February 2016, has been acting in favor of Energy. From only $10.2 billion in 2016, the sector’s earnings jumped to $38 billion in 2017. We expect the sector to rake in $76.8 billion through 2018.Five Oil Stocks to BuyThe weekly U.S. field production data of crude by EIA clearly shows rising volumes of oil through second-quarter 2018. The surging crude production amid favorable commodity pricing environment is expected to support oil exploration and production companies in Q2.Choosing stocks with earnings beat potential might be a difficult task unless one knows the way to shortlist. One way to do this is to pick stocks that have the combination of a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP.Earnings ESP is our proprietary methodology for identifying stocks that have high chances of surprising in their upcoming earnings announcements.

1507,COP,"ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report) has received consent from board of directors for increasing share repurchase program for 2018 by 50% to $3 billion from $2 billion. In 2018, the company will have sufficient cash from operations to fund the program along with dividend and capital expenditures.Currently, the company has a total share repurchase authorization of $6 billion. The 2018 share repurchase program expansion to $3 billion along with shares repurchased worth $3 billion during 2016 and 2017, will fully utilize the board’s existing authorization. Therefore, the board has authorized additional share repurchases of $9 billion, taking the total amount to $15 billion.In late 2016, ConocoPhillips had commenced the current share repurchase program. The $15-billion authorization reflects about 20% of the total shares outstanding as of Sep 30, 2016. This comprises shares already repurchased under this program as well as future repurchases based on the current share price.ConocoPhillips also announced that it has reduced debt by $2.1 billion during the second quarter and has attained declared debt target of $15 billion much before the original target date of 2019 end.The board of directors holds the discretionary power to execute the repurchase authorization. The level or rate of activity may be impacted by future earnings, financial condition, capital requirements, levels of indebtedness, credit ratings and other considerations that are relevant.These initiatives emphasize the company’s commitment toward boosting shareholders’ value.

1508,COP,"By now, the year 2018 can easily be credited to trade tensions. In the first half, the two countries targeted $50 billion of each other’s goods for tit-for tat tariffs. But now, the situation has deteriorated with President Trump’s latest threat of 10% tariffs on further $200 billion in products imported from China.Trump has even gone on to say that if Beijing continues to retaliate, the United States will impose a total tariff on $550 billion in Chinese goods – an amount that was not even the total U.S. import from China last year.Now, if any broader investing spectrum falls prey to such political tensions, then that will be the large caps. Though the large-cap index S&P 500 started 2018 on a better footing than the Russell 2000, the game started changing from mid-March. President Trump’s protectionist agenda and the resultant trade war fears started weighing on large-cap stocks.Trade War Fear Seems Oversold, Time to Look at Better Data Points?Investors should note that after a nagging four-month trade war talks, investors seem to be ignoring the reality in July. U.S. stock futures are trading at a five-month high currently. This is especially true given that Chinese and U.S. officials have lately hinted at the prospect of recommencing talks over trade between the two countries.Three big ETFs including SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY  -  Free Report), SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (DIA  -  Free Report) and Invesco QQQ ETF (QQQ  -  Free Report) have added about 0.9%, 1.2% and 1.5%, respectively, in the past five days (as of Jul 12, 2018).Investors also shifted focus to upbeat U.S. economic data points from the trade war. U.S. employers added 213,000 new jobs in June, after an upwardly revised 244,000 in May. The number breezed past market expectations of 195,000. The momentum in the manufacturing sector is equally upbeat with the sector logging the strongest expansion in four months in June.If this was not enough, U.S. retail sales rose the maximum in six months in May. Sales increased 0.8% sequentially in the month, after an upwardly revised 0.4% growth in April, handily beating market expectations of a 0.4% rise.Earnings Growth Momentum SolidEarnings for the S&P 500 index are expected to be up 19.1% in Q2 on 8.2% higher revenues, per the Earnings Trends issued on Jul 11.  Investors should note that the present earnings cycle for the S&P 500 started from 2009, when the U.S. economy came out of its last recession.By now, the growth momentum should have slowed and reached the historical normalized pace of the mid-single-digits’ level. But an expected double-digit growth rate for Q2 earnings is the result of the tax reform, per the Earnings Trends.The Atlanta Fed estimates real GDP growth in the second quarter of 2018 to be 3.8%, much higher than the 2.0% rate recorded in Q1. The combination of these factors should continue to boost growth stocks.Why Large Caps?Having said this, while all sorts of growth ETFs may scale higher, large-caps are likely to enjoy some special benefits. This is because, large-caps have been subdued this year on trade concerns, resulting in cheaper valuation.Secondly, large-cap stocks perform better in a falling dollar environment as these have wide foreign exposure. Along with many analysts, we too believe that “tariffs, rising debt and deficits” may put a downward pressure on the greenback. This could bode well for large-cap stocks.Given this, we have highlighted a few top-ranked, large-cap growth stocks for investors. These large-cap stocks have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and Growth score of A.NetApp Inc. (NTAP  -  Free Report)It is the data authority for hybrid cloud and hails from a top-ranked Zacks industry (top 20%).ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report)It is a major global exploration and production (E&P) company with operations all over the world.

1509,COP,"The U.S. Energy Department's inventory release showed that crude stockpiles recorded its largest weekly draw since 2016. The massive 12.6 million barrels dip pushed storage levels to their lowest since February 2015, while keeping them under the five-year average. Despite the record decline, U.S. benchmark crude futures lost as much as 5% (or $3.73) to $70.38 per barrel Wednesday – the worst daily slump in 13 months. The front month West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures further edged down to $70.33 at yesterday’s close.The price plunge could be attributed to fears of supply resumption from Libya and escalating trade conflict between the United States and China.Analysis of the EIA DataCrude Oil: The federal government’s EIA report revealed that crude inventories fell by 12.6 million barrels for the week ending Jul 6, following a shock increase of 1.2 million barrels in the previous week. The analysts surveyed by S&P Global Platts – the leading independent commodities and energy data provider – had expected crude stocks to go down some 4.8 million barrels.Steep decline in imports, partly due to an outage at Syncrude facility in Canada, led to the massive stockpile draw with the world's biggest oil consumer even as domestic production remains at 10.9 million barrels per day – the most since the EIA started maintaining weekly data in 1983.Oil inventories have generally trended lower in a year and a half. In fact, stockpiles have shrunk in 45 of the last 66 weeks and are down more than 90 million barrels in the past year. The gradual fall has helped the U.S. crude market shift from year-over-year storage surplus to a deficit. At 405.2 million barrels, current crude supplies are 18% below the year-ago figure and 4% under the five-year average.Moreover, stocks at the Cushing terminal in Oklahoma – the key delivery hub for U.S. crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange – plunged 2.1 million barrels to 25.7 million barrels.The crude supply cover was down from 23.7 days in the previous week to 22.90 days. In the year-ago period, the supply cover was 29.0 days.Gasoline: Gasoline supplies were down for the second week. The 694,000 barrels draw – below the polled number of one million barrels fall in supply level – took gasoline stockpiles down to 239 million barrels. Following last week’s decline, the stock of the most widely used petroleum product is now 1.4% above the year-earlier level and is 6% over the five-year range.Distillate: Distillate fuel supplies (including diesel and heating oil) went up 4.1 million barrels last week, ahead of analysts’ expectations for 1.7 million barrels increase in supply level. The fourth successive weekly rise could be attributed to lower demand. At 121.7 million barrels, current supplies are 21% below the year-ago level and 12% lower than the five-year average.Refinery Rates: Refinery utilization was down by 0.4% from the prior week to 96.7%.About the Weekly Petroleum Status ReportThe Energy Information Administration (EIA) Petroleum Status Report, containing data of the previous week ending Friday, outlines information regarding the weekly change in petroleum inventories held and produced by the U.S., both locally and abroad.The report provides an overview of the level of reserves and their movements, thereby helping investors understand the demand/supply dynamics of petroleum products. It is an indicator of current oil prices and volatility that affect the businesses of the companies engaged in the oil and refining industry.The data from EIA generally acts as a catalyst for crude prices and affect producers, such as ExxonMobil (XOM  -  Free Report), Chevron (CVX  -  Free Report) and ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report), and refiners such as Valero Energy (VLO  -  Free Report), Phillips 66 (PSX  -  Free Report) and Marathon Petroleum (MPC  -  Free Report).Want to Own an Energy Stock Now?If you are looking for a near-term energy play, Whiting Petroleum Corporation (WLL  -  Free Report) may be an excellent selection.

1510,COP,"The U.S. Energy Department's inventory release showed that crude stockpiles recorded an unexpected weekly build as domestic oil production reached another all-time high. On a further bearish note, the report revealed that refined product inventories, gasoline and distillate, both rose from their week earlier levels.Following the negative data sets, the front month West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures lost 1.2% (or 79 cents) to $64.73 per barrel yesterday – the lowest settlement since Apr 9.Analysis of the EIA DataCrude Oil: The federal government’s EIA report revealed that crude inventories rose by 2.1 million barrels for the week ending Jun 1, following a decrease of 3.6 million barrels in the previous week. The analysts surveyed by S&P Global Platts – the leading independent commodities and energy data provider – had expected crude stocks to go down some 1.3 million barrels.Soaring imports and record high domestic production led to the shock build with the world's biggest oil consumer even as refiner demand hit a five-month high.In particular, U.S. output rose by 31,000 barrels per day last week to 10.8 million barrels per day – the most since the EIA started maintaining weekly data in 1983. In early February, oil production broke through the 10 million barrels a day threshold for the first time in nearly 50 years and has maintained the record levels thereafter.Despite last week’s increase, oil inventories have generally trended lower in a year and a half. In fact, stockpiles have shrunk in 41 of the last 61 weeks and are down more than 75 million barrels in the past year. The gradual fall has helped the U.S. crude market shift from year-over-year storage surplus to a deficit. At 436.6 million barrels, current crude supplies are 15% below the year-ago period and are in the bottom half of the average range during this time of the year.Moreover, stocks at the Cushing terminal in Oklahoma – the key delivery hub for U.S. crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange – fell 955,000 barrels to 34.6 million barrels.The crude supply cover was down from 26 days in the previous week to 25.8 days. In the year-ago period, the supply cover was 29.7 days.Gasoline: Gasoline supplies were up a third week in a row as demand weakened. The 4.6 million barrels gain – defying the polled number of 600,000 barrels fall in supply level – took gasoline stockpiles up to 239 million barrels. Following last week’s addition, the stock of the most widely used petroleum product inched closer to the year-earlier level and it is in the top half of the average range.Distillate: Distillate fuel supplies (including diesel and heating oil) went up 2.2 million barrels last week, significantly ahead of analysts’ expectations for 700,000 barrels increase in supply level. The weekly rise could be attributed to lower demand. At 116.8 million barrels, current supplies are 22.7% below the year-ago level and are in the lower half of the average range for this time of the year.Refinery Rates: Refinery utilization was up by 1.5% from the prior week to 95.4%.About the Weekly Petroleum Status ReportThe Energy Information Administration (EIA) Petroleum Status Report, containing data of the previous week ending Friday, outlines information regarding the weekly change in petroleum inventories held and produced by the U.S., both locally and abroad.The report provides an overview of the level of reserves and their movements, thereby helping investors understand the demand/supply dynamics of petroleum products.

1511,COP,"Royal Dutch Shell plc (RDS.A  -  Free Report) has been making remarkable progress in forging ahead with its deepwater projects of late. The European oil giant recently announced that the first phase of its deepwater Kaikias project in the Gulf of Mexico (GoM) has become functional and that too one year prior to the scheduled date. The first phase of the project is expected to produce up to 40,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.Competitive Kaikias ProjectThe Kaikias project is a joint venture undertaken by Shell and MOEX North America, a subsidiary of Tokyo-based Mitsui Oil Exploration Co. Shell holds 80% operating interest in the project, while the remaining 20% stake is held by MOEX North America. Kaikias is estimated to hold more than 100 million barrels of oil equivalent and the project is set to develop in two phases.The Kaikias project, located in the Mars-Ursa basin, will send production from four wells to Ursa Hub that is jointly owned by Shell, BP plc (BP  -  Free Report), ExxonMobil Corporation (XOM  -  Free Report) and ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report). Shell is the chief operator of the hub with 45% stake, BP carries 23% interest while ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips own 16% each. From the Ursa hub, the production volumes will finally flow into the Mars oil pipeline.Shell took the final investment decision (FID) on the project in March 2017 and has been betting on cost and technology efficiencies to make the project more competitive since then. Notably, it has managed to lower the cost of Kaikias by 30% since the FID on the project. Simplified well designs, along with utilization of the existing oil/gas processing equipment and subsea umbilicals brought down the costs. While the total cost of the project has not been disclosed; Shell expects to push breakeven oil prices lower than $30 per barrel.Shell: A Deepwater PowerhouseDeepwater development activities have been severely affected by the crude downturn; however, with the recovering oil prices, this segment of the oil industry is gradually picking up pace, with Shell leading the way. Superior technology, capital efficiency, efficient execution and structural re-engineering are enabling the company to remain competitive in the deepwater industry.Along with Kaikias, Shell also has three more GoM deepwater projects in its kitty, namely Appomattox, Coulomb Phase 2 and Vito. Appomattox is one of the most profitable and significant deepwater development projects of Shell, offering attractive long-term opportunities in the Gulf of Mexico and expected to produce up to 175,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day. Shell announced its final decision to invest in the project in July 2015. The project witnessed 20% savings from its original investment proposal, owing to designing technology.Shell is also advancing its Coulomb Phase 2 project, comprising subsea system with potential tiebacks to the Na Kika production hub. With the project’s break-even price below $40 a barrel, first oil from the project is expected in a couple of months or more.The Vito project is another Shell’s multibillion-dollar project authorized last month. Though Shell did not disclose the cost of the project, it is known to have sliced its price tag around 70% from the original project design.Recently, the company also discovered a large deepwater well, the Dover well, in the Norphlet geologic play in the U.S. GoM — marking the sixth oil and natural gas find that Shell has struck in the region. The company has been focusing on the exploration opportunities in the prolific Norphlet play, which will be moored by its multibillion-dollar offshore project Appomattox, production from which is expected to commence before 2019 end.In the first quarter of 2018, Shell’s deepwater production stood at 731,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (Boe/d) globally. Banking on the improving energy landscape, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company expects its global deepwater production to overshoot 900,000 Boe/d by 2020.

1512,COP,"Stocks ended lower on May 25 as crude prices plummeted. The immediate trigger for a decline in oil prices was reports that OPEC and Russia were discussing an increase in oil production. Consequently, stocks of energy companies suffered losses.The energy sector has been on a dream run this year following OPEC and other major oil producers’ decision to extend an output controls agreement. Consequently, oil prices touched three-year highs recently. But could a reconsideration of the same agreement end crude’s spectacular rally? Oil Prices Suffer Weekly LossesOn May 25, the price of WTI crude declined by 4% or $2.83 to end at $67.88 per barrel. This was the largest daily loss for U.S. crude price since July 2017. Currently, oil is nearly 7% lower than the recent highs above $72. This was also its lowest close since May 1. Further, prices suffered a weekly decline of 4.9%.Additionally, Brent crude lost 3% or $2.35 to close at $76.44 per barrel. This was its lowest close since May 8. Brent crude also suffered a weekly loss of 2.6%. In recent weeks, a collapse in production in Venezuela and fears that exports from Iran will fall post Trump’s decision to exit the nuclear deal had boosted prices.Reports of Output Increase Cause DeclineThe decline in crude prices weighed on shares of energy companies. Consequently, shares of oil majors Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM  -  Free Report) and Chevron Corporation (CVX  -  Free Report) declined 1.9% and 3.5%, respectively.Shares of Schlumberger Limited (SLB  -  Free Report) and ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report) Inc. also declined 3.7% and 4.4%, respectively. ConocoPhillips has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The immediate trigger for the decline in crude prices was reports that OPEC and key non-OPEC oil producers were considering an increase in output. On May 25, Russia’s energy minister Alexander Novak met his Saudi counterpart Khalid Al-Falih in Petersburg to discuss the output controls agreement.Subsequently, reports emerged that an increase in production levels was being considered for the first time since 2016. The current agreement, which has been in force since January 2017, aims to limit output to 1.8 million barrels a day.According to a report from Reuters, the planned increase in output is as high as 1 million barrels. Bloomberg has reported that output may be increased by 300,000 barrels to 800,000 barrels per day. Currently, global inventories are close to OPEC’s targeted level, another factor which has helped to boost prices to three-year highs recently.Forecasts for Prices Remain HighAnother reason for the decline in crude prices on last Friday was an increase in total active U.S. rig count. A report from Baker Hughes (BHGE  -  Free Report) revealed that the number of active U.S. rigs drilling for oil increased by 15 to 859 over last week. This was the biggest weekly increase since the week ended February 9.However, despite the losses incurred on Friday Société Générale (SCGLY  -  Free Report) revised its projections for oil prices upward. The bank now believes Brent crude will maintain an average of $72.75 in 2019, $7.75 higher than its earlier forecast. The outlook for WTI was also revised upward by $6.75 to $67.75.The primary reason for analysts’ projections for a continuing uptrend is the massive decline in Venezuelan output. Analysts at the Paris-based bank now believe that monthly declines will continue at the current rate into 2019. The projected fall in crude supplies due to the United States’ decision to exit the Iran nuclear deal is also likely to boost prices in the medium term. 5 Medical Stocks to Buy NowZacks names 5 companies poised to ride a medical breakthrough that is targeting cures for leukemia, AIDS, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, and other conditions.New products in this field are already generating substantial revenue and even more wondrous treatments are in the pipeline.

1513,COP,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report). Shares have added about 2.2% in that time frame.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is COP due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.First-Quarter 2018 ResultsConocoPhillips reported first-quarter 2018 adjusted earnings of 96 cents per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 74 cents. In the prior-year quarter, the company had posted a loss of 14 cents.Revenues of $8,961 million steered past the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8,680 million and improved from $7,771 million in the year-ago quarter.The strong first-quarter results were supported by higher oil and natural gas price realizations.The company has a strong discipline of returning cash back to shareholders. Through the first quarter, as high as 30% of the company’s operating cashflow has been returned through dividend payments and shares repurchases.Exploration and ProductionProduction from continuing operations averaged 1,269 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (MBOED) in the quarter, lower than 1,593 MBOED in the year-ago quarter. The decline was led by divestment of assets and decline of field.Price RealizationAverage realized price for oil was $65.49 a barrel, up from $50.97 in the year-earlier quarter. Natural gas liquids were sold at $28.37 a barrel, up from $24.87 in the year-ago quarter. The price of natural gas was $5.13 per thousand cubic feet, up from $3.84 in first-quarter 2017.FinancialsAs of Mar 31, 2018, the company had total cash and cash equivalents of $5.2 billion and debt of $17.1 billion, with a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 36%. In the reported quarter, ConocoPhillips generated $2.4 billion in cash from operating activities. Capital expenditures and investments totaled $1.5 billion and dividends payments grossed $338 million.Total ExpensesExpenses of $7.2 billion in the first quarter contracted from $8 billion in the January-to-March quarter of 2017.GuidanceConocoPhillips reiterated its 2018 capital spending at $5.5 billion. For the April-to-June quarter of this year, the company projects production in the range of 1,170-1,210 MBOED.For 2018, the company’s production projection was raised from 1,195 -1,235 MBOED to 1,200-1,240 MBOED.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in fresh estimates. There have been four revisions higher for the current quarter compared to one lower. In the past month, the consensus estimate has shifted by 7.98 % due to these changes.ConocoPhillips Price and Consensus  ConocoPhillips Price and Consensus | ConocoPhillips QuoteVGM ScoresAt this time, COP has a strong Growth Score of A, a grade with the same score on the momentum front. However, the stock was allocated a grade of C on the value side, putting it in the middle 20% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of A. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Based on our scores, the stock is equally suitable for growth and momentum investors.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending upward for the stock and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising. Notably, COP has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.

1514,COP,"Per Bloomberg, BP plc (BP  -  Free Report) and ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report) are in talks over an asset swap deal. Per the agreement, BP will raise stake in the North Sea Clair field, offshore U.K., in exchange of its assets in Alaska.BP is contemplating to acquire ConocoPhillips’ 24% interest in the Clair field. BP, the operator of the field, already has a holding of 28.6%. In return, ConocoPhillips will acquire some of BP’s assets in Alaska. The companies did not disclose any details.Per BP, Clair is the largest undeveloped hydrocarbon resource in the U.K. continental shelf. Global oil giants including BP are making a shift in their portfolios by divesting their mature North Sea assets and investing in areas where it’s cheaper to produce oil and natural gas. As new players are investing additional capital and introducing new technology, the region is undergoing a revival. BP intends to focus on a few projects as it aims higher output.Per sources, the companies have not reached any final decision and talks regarding the deal may fall apart. The sources were not aware of the exact Alaskan assets that were being auctioned. Among BP’s holdings, Prudhoe Bay is the biggest field. The field commenced production in the 1970s.ConocoPhillips has been consistently trying to focus on the shale in the United States. Evidently, the company increased its exploration activity in Alaska. In 2017, it turned out to be the largest oil producer in the region. In February 2018, the company announced a deal to acquire a stake in Anadarko Petroleum Corp.’s (APC  -  Free Report) project on the western North Slope, including an interest in the Alpine pipeline. Meanwhile, ConocoPhillips has been lowering its exposure to the U.K., as fields in the region mature. According to an announcement made by ConocoPhillips in April, it proposes to cut 450 jobs in Britain between Oct 1, 2018 and April 2020 as well as close output through its Theddlethorpe Gas Terminal.ConocoPhillips is the operator or has interests in other U.K. fields, including Britannia, Judy and Galleon.Price PerformanceDuring the past three months, BP’s shares have gained 21.9% compared with the industry’s 21% rally. Zacks Rank & Key PickBP currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Another top-ranked player in the same sector is Equinor ASA (EQNR  -  Free Report),  which sports a Zacks Rank #1.

1515,COP,"West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude continues to trade above the $70-a-barrel psychological mark in the wake of concerns that Iran’s crude export might fall after Trump nixed the nuclear deal.Higher oil prices are definitely a plus for all drillers in major U.S shale plays. Investors interested in the energy sector should know which oil plays are profitable at the moment.The Permian Basin has long been the favorite oil and gas play for drillers, as the region supported companies even when oil was trading below $50, per media reports. At such a low price level, most explorers struggled to survive in areas like Eagle Ford and instead chose to focus on the Permian Basin by dumping assets in other plays.However, the situation is quite different now with Eagle Ford taking center stage following the bottleneck in the Permian pipeline.Strong Permian OperationsThe Permian region has always been in the spotlight when it comes to oil and natural gas production in the United States. In terms of production, Permian has outrun resources like Anadarko, Appalachia, Bakken, Eagle Ford, Haynesville and Niobrara.As per data provided by the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), oil production from Permian has been increasing steadily over the past several years. Notably, the maximum proportion of crude production in the United States came from Permian.From nearly 1 million barrels a day of crude at the beginning of 2009, Permian’s daily production is now heading toward 3.5 million barrels, per the EIA. While the prolific Permian Basin is undoubtedly the hottest shale play in the United States, Eagle Ford and Bakken are the other regions that have contributed meaningfully to the overall production picture.After a steep fall in rig count in the mid-2014 to mid-2016 period due to crude weakness, the number of rigs exploring oil has started to increase. We can say that the rise in drilling activities has been directly contributing to Permian production.Rising Activities in Eagle Ford From minimal production since the start of 2009, daily production of oil in the Eagle Ford region is now headed toward 1.5 million barrels, per the EIA. This has been supported by an uptick in rig count in the shale play.The weekly rig count in Eagle Ford was mostly in the range of 188 to 214, per data provided by Baker Hughes (BHGE  -  Free Report), a GE company. The count fell to below 30 in mid-2016 and is now treading toward 70, reflecting increasing focus on the shale play.Notably, daily crude production in the Eagle Ford saw upward momentum since early 2011, approaching toward 1.8-million barrels per day. However, production started falling since 2015-beginning as energy market was already grappled with crude weaknesses.Focus Now on Eagle FordEIA predicts new well oil production per rig from Eagle Ford to increase from 1,479 barrels a day in May to 1,532 barrels in June this year. Meanwhile, in the Permian, EIA expects the production growth to be only 2 barrels per day.This seems that drillers and explorers are redirecting focus from the crowded Permian to Eagle Ford. In Permian, there is a dearth of pipeline capacity for transporting oil to Gulf Coast export facilities, major refinery terminals and principal hubs like Cushing. This has forced Midland operators to sell stranded oil at a big discount to that in Cushing.Drillers with strong foresight have already booked the existing pipeline capacity for transporting Permian crude to the principal hubs. Thus, other drillers do not have the incentive to operate in the basin.Also, labor shortage and low pipeline capacity have bumped up the cost of production in the Permian Basin, making the operating scenario unfavorable for new drillers. Hence, upstream players have shifted focus to the Eagle Ford, where the cost of production is relatively low.Eagle Ford Drillers Come to the ForefrontHeadquartered in Houston, TX, ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report) is giving more importance to the Eagle Ford shale play than the crowded Permian Basin, per Ryan Lance, CEO of the upstream energy giant.The company’s prime focus on the Eagle Ford is reflected in the first-quarter 2018 production picture. Through the quarter, the company’s daily oil equivalent production from the Permian Basin was recorded at 19,000 barrels, considerably lower than 163,000 barrels from Eagle Ford. (Read more: ConocoPhillips Chooses Eagle Ford Over Permian: Here's Why).EOG Resources, Inc. (EOG  -  Free Report) is among the leading players in the Bakken play and the largest in the Eagle Ford. In the South Texas Eagle Ford, the company has brought online 72 gross wells through first-quarter 2018. The company’s strong first quarter production was significantly aided by operations in Eagle Ford.Houston, TX-based Marathon Oil Corporation (MRO  -  Free Report) has extensive acres of resources in the oil-rich Eagle Ford. The company’s year-over-year rise in production, available for sale, in the first-quarter 2018 was aided by solid contributions from U.S. resource plays in the Eagle Ford.Chesapeake Energy Corporation (CHK  -  Free Report), headquartered in Oklahoma City, OK, has a footprint across roughly 245,000 acres in the lucrative Eagle Ford. Through 2018, the company plans to bring online up to 140 wells in the Eagle Ford.We advise investors not to dump the above stocks right away as the companies currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1519,COP,"Efficiency, a company’s ability to transform inputs into outputs, is a potential indicator of financial health. Companies with favorable efficiency levels are likely to be on investors’ radar irrespective of market conditions as price performance is believed to be positively correlated with efficiency.Key Ratios to Identify EfficiencySometimes it becomes difficult to measure the efficiency level of a company. This is the reason why one must consider popular efficiency ratios while selecting stocks. These efficiency ratios are:Inventory Turnover: The ratio of 12-month cost of goods sold (COGS) to a four-quarter average inventory is considered one of the most popular efficiency ratios. It indicates a company’s ability to maintain a suitable inventory position. While a high value indicates that the company has a relatively low level of inventory compared to COGS, a low value indicates that the company is facing declining sales, which has resulted in excess inventory. Receivables Turnover:  This is the ratio of 12-month sales to four-quarter average receivables. It shows a company’s potential to extend its credit and collect debt in terms of that credit. A high receivables turnover ratio or the “accounts receivable turnover ratio” or “debtor’s turnover ratio” is desirable as it shows that the company is capable of collecting its accounts receivables or that it has quality customers.Asset Utilization: This ratio indicates a company’s capability to convert assets into output and is thus a widely known measure of efficiency level. It is calculated by dividing total sales over the past 12 months by the last four-quarter average of total assets. Like the above ratios, high asset utilization may indicate that a company is efficient.Operating Margin: This efficiency measure is the ratio of operating income over the past 12 months to sales over the same period. It measures a company’s ability to control operating expenses. Hence, a high value of the ratio may indicate that the company manages its operating expenses more efficiently than peers.Screening ParametersIn addition to the above-mentioned ratios, we have added a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) to the screen with an objective to make this strategy more profitable.Inventory Turnover, Receivables Turnover, Asset Utilization and Operating Margin greater than industry average(Values of these ratios higher than industry averages may indicate that the efficiency level of the company is higher than its peers.)   The use of these few criteria has narrowed down the universe of over 7,906 stocks to only 22.Here are five stocks from the 31 that made it through the screen:Lululemon Athletica Inc. (LULU  -  Free Report), an athletic apparel company, together with its subsidiaries, designs, distributes, and retails athletic apparel and accessories for women, men, and female youth.

1520,COP,"Encana Corporation (ECA  -  Free Report) reported fourth-quarter 2017 operating earnings of 12 cents per share, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 10 cents. The better-than-expected results can be attributed to production growth from its core assets: Permian, Montney, Eagle Ford and Duvernay. The company also benefited from higher realized liquids prices. The bottom line increased from 9 cents per share reported in the year-ago quarter.Quarterly revenues of $1,210 million also topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,016 million. Revenues were 47.2% higher than the prior-year figure of $822 million.Encana Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Encana Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Encana Corporation QuoteProduction & PricesTotal fourth-quarter production came at 335,200 barrels of oil equivalent per day (BOE/d) compared with 321,500 BOE/d in the prior-year quarter. The four core assets accounted for 93% of the total production.Quarterly natural gas production declined approximately 14% year over year to 1,096 million cubic feet per day, while liquids production rose 40% from the prior-year quarter to 152.6 thousand barrels per day.Encana's realized natural gas price was $2.34 per thousand cubic feet, compared with the year-ago quarter level of $2.35. Meanwhile, realized liquids price rose to $55.4 per barrel from $49.29 in the fourth quarter of 2016.Costs & ExpensesTotal operating expenses increased 8.2% from fourth-quarter 2016 to $948 million. The rise is primarily attributed to an increase in depreciation, depletion and amortization charges along with transportation expenses.Capital Spending and Balance SheetEncana's capital investments during the quarter were $509 million. As of Dec 31, 2017, cash and cash equivalents were $719 million and long-term debt was $4,197 million. This, in turn, represents a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 38.4%.About the CompanyBased in Calgary, Alberta, Encana is a focused pure-play natural gas exploration and production (E&P) company. It is the second largest gas producer in North America, holding a highly competitive position in terms of land and resource among a number of promising shale and tight gas resource plays in the region. This provides the company with a low risk, long-life and a sustainable growth profile.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderEncana carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked players in the energy space are ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report), NuStar GP Holdings, LLC (NSH  -  Free Report) and TOTAL S.A.

1521,COP,"Per the latest investor presentation, Kinder Morgan Inc. (KMI  -  Free Report) proposes to lower spending on Canadian subsidiary in 2017.In 2017, the company is likely to spend $446.5 million on growth capital for its Canadian subsidiary, down 38% from the earlier projection of $721 million as stated in another presentation in September.Of the total spending, $365.18 million has been apportioned to pipelines and $81.18 million to terminals, down from $629.70 million and $91.33 million, respectively.This change has been confirmed by a spokesman of the company, who stated that the change was primarily due to operational delay on the Trans Mountain expansion project. The 590,000 barrel per day pipeline has been deferred since the company did not receive permits for the use of Crown land in Canada, promptly.As expected, the pipeline might come online by the end of 2019, if the company is able to offset the deferral on construction. However, the spending has been pushed to 2018 and beyond.Currently, Kinder Morgan is one of the three companies trying to construct a pipeline to meet demand for crude takeaway capacity in western Canada.About Kinder MorganKinder Morgan, headquartered in Houston, TX, has the largest network of natural gas pipeline in North America that spreads over almost 70,000 miles. Most importantly, the company’s midstream properties are linked to all the prospective plays in the United States which are rich in natural gas. These extensive pipeline networks, for which almost $32 billion has been invested to date, have been providing Kinder Morgan with stable fee-based revenues.However, we are concerned about Kinder Morgan’s weak balance sheet. As of third-quarter 2017, total debt — both short and long term — is pegged at $37.1 billion. The debt capital is higher than the total equity capital of $36.5 billion which depicts the company’s significant exposure to debt.Price PerformanceShares of the company have lost 3.7% compared with the industry’s decline of 9.6% in the last three months. Zacks Rank & Key PicksKinder Morgan currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1522,COP,"Per Reuters, Weatherford International (WFT  -  Free Report) has appointed advisors, including Morgan Stanley, to ease the high debt burden of $7.9 billion by disposing some units. The asset divestment will begin in the first quarter of 2018.The assets to be sold off include the company’s drilling tools and wellheads units, the international pressure pumping business and the artificial lift business. Some of the potential bidders for the pressure pumping assets will include domestic company Superior Energy Services and Canada’s Calfrac Well Services, as well as energy funds backed by private equity firms.Per another source, oilfield services firms functioning in the Middle East and North Africa — core areas of Weatherford’s operations — can also be potential bidders.In 2016, Weatherford put up its land drilling business for sale at an estimated cost of below $1 billion but failed to strike a deal. Currently, the company plans to sell the business in parts based on regional operations.Though oil prices have touched pre-2014 levels, Weatherford projects about $500 million in additional proceeds from assets divested over the next one year.With crude prices down from June 2014 levels, most drillers have significantly curbed their capital expenditures. This is expected to hamper Weatherford’s business to assist the drilling firms in setting up oil wells. As a result, the company has also resorted to downsizing. Analysts expect consolidation in the oilfield services industry to continue.  In March 2017, Weatherford and Schlumberger Ltd (SLB  -  Free Report) inked an agreement to form a joint venture aiming at North America’s unconventional resource development. Weatherford considers the transaction to deleverage balance sheet, while it can receive considerable exposure to the unconventional market.Price PerformanceShares of the company have declined 11% against the industry’s rally of 6.8% in the last three months. Zacks RankWeatherford currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1523,COP,"Eni S.p.A.’s (E  -  Free Report) refineries may face complete closure following orders of a preliminary investigations judge to seize crude product measurement devices at the company's facilities in Italy. Per the company, the order that will halt refining and fuel supply operations is in connection with charges of tax evasion. The petroleum product measuring devices that have been seized by judiciary authorities will be tested for their integrity. Per Reuters, the authorities believe that the devices were tampered with to enable the state-run company sell more products than recorded, thus evading tax amounting to €10 million ($12 million).The company has refuted any unlawful actions on its part. Moreover, to reduce the total impact of the shutdown, the company is planning to seek the authorities’ permission for using the devices.The company conducts its refining operations in Italy through its wholly owned Sannazzaro, Livorno and Taranto plants. Eni also has 50% interest in Milazzo refinery, with Kuwait Petroleum holding the remaining stake. Moreover, the company has two bio-refineries in the country, Venezia and Gela. Also, the company held 24.3% share of the Italian refined products retail market last year, thus emerging as the leading player.About the Company Headquartered in Rome, Italy, Eni is a leading integrated energy player with its operations spread all around the world. Investors should know that Start-up of new upstream projects in Ghana and Angola as well as Indonesia have been supporting Eni's oil production growth.However, increasing debt load is a reflective of the company’s weak balance sheet. Also, exploration expenses during the first nine months of 2017 increased 29.6% as compared to the year-ago comparable period. Moreover, Eni has gained 2.3% year to date, underperforming the 2.6% growth of its industry.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderEni currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the oil and energy sector include ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report), Northern Oil and Gas, Inc.

1524,COP,"ExxonMobil Corporation (XOM  -  Free Report) has dismissed non-essential staff from its Papua New Guinea (PNG) liquefied natural gas (LNG) project due to turbulence in the area.The community tension in the Highlands (Hides, Angore, Komo) has forced ExxonMobil to abandon non-essential activities in the region. However, the company refused to provide details relating to the nature of the operations.The company’s gas-conditioning at Hides is still operational. The plant processes gas before it is transported through a 760-kilometer (472-mile) pipeline to the PNG LNG export plant at Port Moresby.Per sources, enraged locals stirred unrest in the regions over the nation’s election process earlier in the current year and disagreement over royalties from the PNG LNG project. Last week, a staff of ExxonMobil in Angore was kidnapped but was later released unharmed.The company is constantly examining the condition in Hela p_rovince as the safety of employees, contractors and the local community is its primary concern.Oil Search Ltd, the operator of oil and gas fields in the area as well as a partner in PNG LNG stated that its operations have not been affected.About ExxonMobilExxonMobil has a leading position in the energy industry owing to the size and diversity of asset base, in terms of business mix and geographical footprint.

1525,COP,"The U.S. Energy Department's inventory release showed that crude stockpiles recorded a lower-than-expected weekly draw. On a further bearish note, the report revealed that refined product inventories, gasoline and distillate, both rose slightly from their week earlier levels. Meanwhile, refinery activity improved.However, the talking point from the data sets was the steady trend of rising domestic oil production that continues to be the biggest headwind for the market.Despite the mostly negative data sets, the benchmark was buoyed by the fact that commercial inventories actually dropped after notching up successive weekly builds.The U.S. oil benchmark also rallied on expectations that OPEC and other major producers will agree to expand their output-cut deal beyond March when they meet at the end of the month. The agreement, already renewed once, keeps 1.8 million barrels a day off the market in an attempt to clear a supply glut.Further support came from the shutdown of TransCanada Corporation’s (TRP  -  Free Report) 590,000 barrel-per-day Keystone oil pipeline – one of the largest from Canada to the United States – due to a leak and subsequent cleanup operations.As a result, the front month West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures gained 2.1% (or $1.19) to $58.02 per barrel yesterday – the highest settlement since Jun 30, 2015.Energy Stocks GainThe bullish oil market sentiment encouraged buying in energy stocks, which lifted the Energy Select Sector SPDR – an assortment of the largest U.S. energy companies – almost 0.4% Wednesday. Some of the biggest gainers of the S&P 500 yesterday were oil and oil-related companies like Chesapeake Energy Corporation (CHK  -  Free Report), Range Resources Corporation (RRC  -  Free Report), Marathon Oil Corporation (MRO  -  Free Report), Southwestern Energy Company (SWN  -  Free Report) and Helmerich & Payne, Inc. (HP  -  Free Report).Analysis of the EIA DataCrude Oil: The federal government’s EIA report revealed that crude inventories fell by 1.9 million barrels for the week ending Nov 17, following a rise of 1.9 million barrels in the previous week. The analysts surveyed by S&P Global Platts – the leading independent commodities and energy data provider – had expected crude stocks to go down some 2.1 million barrels.An uptick in refinery demand led to the stockpile draw with the world's biggest oil consumer. But the withdrawal failed to match up with expectations as U.S. output rose by 13,000 barrels per day last week to 9.7 million barrels per day – the most since the EIA started maintaining weekly data in 1983.Oil stockpiles have shrunk in 25 of the last 33 weeks and are down more than 76 million barrels since April. The gradual fall has helped the U.S. crude market shift from year-over-year storage surplus to a deficit. At 457.1 million barrels, current crude supplies are 6.5% below the year-ago period though they are in the upper half of the average range during this time of the year.Meanwhile, stocks at the Cushing terminal in Oklahoma – the key delivery hub for U.S. crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange – was down by 1.8 million barrels to 61.2 million barrels.The crude supply cover was down from 28.3 days in the previous week to 27.8 days. In the year-ago period, the supply cover was 30.7 days.Gasoline: Supplies of gasoline were up for the second straight week as production jumped. The small, 44,000 barrels addition – compared to the polled number of 1 million barrels rise in supply level – took gasoline stockpiles up to 210.5 million barrels. Despite last week’s increase, the existing stock of the most widely used petroleum product remains 6% below the year-earlier level but is in the middle of the average range.Distillate: Distillate fuel supplies (including diesel and heating oil) edged up 269,000 barrels last week, contrary to analysts’ expectations for 1.8 million barrels decrease in supply level. The marginal weekly rise could be attributed to healthy production. At 125 million barrels, current supplies are 16.2% below the year-ago level and are in the middle of the average range for this time of the year.Refinery Rates: Refinery utilization was up by 0.3% from the prior week to 91.3%.About the Weekly Petroleum Status ReportThe Energy Information Administration (EIA) Petroleum Status Report, containing data of the previous week ending Friday, outlines information regarding the weekly change in petroleum inventories held and produced by the U.S., both locally and abroad.The report provides an overview of the level of reserves and their movements, thereby helping investors understand the demand/supply dynamics of petroleum products. It is an indicator of current oil prices and volatility that affect the businesses of the companies engaged in the oil and refining industry.Want to Own an Energy Stock Now?If you are looking for a near-term energy play, ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report) may be a good selection.

1528,COP,"Per Reuters, BP plc (BP  -  Free Report) is planning to acquire a stake in Cairn Energy’s oil assets, located offshore Senegal.Subject to approval by the state, BP intends to buy 30% interest in Cairn Energy’s deepwater SNE field. This acquisition is likely to be valued at $600 million.However, the companies have declined to disclose details.The waters off Senegal, along with neighbors Mauritania and Gambia, have been consistently pursued by oil majors. The region is believed to hold a large reserve of oil.This transaction is expected to enhance BP’s position in Senegal. In December 2016, the company formed a joint venture with Kosmos Energy and discovered a huge gas deposit in May 2017. BP has two more offshore field investments in the region.It is to be noted that over the next ten years, Senegal and Mauritania are likely to be two important areas in BP’s portfolio. The company intends to make huge investments in the Tortue LNG project, which is anticipated to yield first gas in 2021.The deepwater SNE project represents the first oil development in the West African nation.

1529,COP,"Continental Resources, Inc. (CLR  -  Free Report) has announced the sale of second international consignment of Bakken crude oil.The exploration and production company proposes to sell 430,000 barrels of oil for January delivery to international markets. The transaction is expected to take place in Cushing, OK.This news closely follows the company’s announcement for the sale of 1,005,000 barrels of Bakken crude oil to Atlantic Trading and Marketing, in October. This oil was planned for export to China.The lifting of the 1977 crude oil export ban in December 2015 helped the industry to pursue energy export, which has grown rapidly since then. Continental Resources believes that stable production of oil in the United States and higher export will drive inventories. The company believes that this will correct the disparity between Brent and WTI prices. Contemporary improved transportation mode for crude will also help to open the international market for Continental Resources' light sweet oil.About the CompanyContinental Resources is a crude-oil concentrated, independent oil and natural gas exploration and production company with operations in the Rocky Mountain, Mid-Continent and Gulf Coast regions of the United States. The company focuses on large new and developing plays where horizontal drilling, advanced fracture stimulation and enhanced recovery technologies provide the means to economically develop and produce oil and natural gas reserves from unconventional formations.Price PerformanceThe company’s shares have returned 8.9% as against the industry’s decline of 5% in the past six months.Zacks Rank & Key PicksContinental Resources currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1530,COP,"Statoil ASA  has decided to accelerate oil and gas exploration activities in the Norwegian Continental Shelf (“NCS”) in 2018.In 2014, when commodity prices started dropping drastically, oil companies had to lower exploration budgets considerably. However, these companies have reinitiated exploration activities. This implies additional work for owners of drilling rigs, such as Transocean Ltd or Seadrill Limited.Statoil is reviving from the depression and has become one of the most dynamic offshore explorers. The majority-state owned company intends to drill 25 to 30 wells in Norway in 2018. Per the previous plan, Statoil planned to drill 16 to 18 wells in 2017. The number also includes partner-operated wells.Earlier, the company forwarded a proposal to drill five wells in the Barents Sea in 2018. This area is perceived as an unexplored region offshore Norway.In 2017, Statoil projected to drill about 30 exploration wells worldwide at a total budget of $1.3 billion. However, the company has not revealed the number for 2018, as a few wells are in the planning stage.In 2016, Statoil drilled a total of 23 exploration wells as operator and partner, including 14 offshore Norway.Statoil’s endeavors to improve resource recovery in mature fields are commendable. The company has operations in all major hydrocarbon-producing regions of the world, with an emphasis on the NCS. We believe that the commpany is well positioned to sustain steady production growth in the next few years on the back of a large resource base at NCS. Its expertise in operating in this region will enable the company to achieve targets.Price PerformanceThe company’s shares have returned 9.1% compared with the industry’s rally of 4.8% in the past six months. Zacks Rank & Other Key PicksStatoil currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

1531,COP,"The U.S. Energy Department's inventory release showed that crude stockpiles recorded an unexpected weekly build. The report further revealed that gasoline inventories increased slightly from previous week, while distillate stocks recorded a fall.Meanwhile, refinery activity improved. However, the talking point from the data sets was the steady trend of rising domestic oil production that continues to be the biggest headwind for the market.As a result, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures shed 0.7% (or 37 cents) to $55.33 per barrel Wednesday – the lowest settlement since Nov 2. The commodity fell further yesterday, finishing at $55.14 (down 19 cents or 0.3%).Analysis of the EIA DataCrude Oil: The federal government’s EIA report revealed that crude inventories increased by 1.9 million barrels for the week ending Nov 10, following a rise of 2.2 million barrels in the previous week. The analysts surveyed by S&P Global Platts – the leading independent commodities and energy data provider – had expected crude stocks to go down some one million barrels.Record high domestic production and higher imports led to the surprise stockpile build with the world's biggest oil consumer. In particular, U.S. output rose by 25,000 barrels per day last week to more than 9.6 million barrels per day – the most since the EIA started maintaining weekly data in 1983.While oil inventories rose for a second successive week, stockpiles have shrunk in 24 of the last 32 weeks and are down more than 75 million barrels since April. The gradual fall has helped the U.S. crude market shift from year-over-year storage surplus to a deficit. At 459 million barrels, current crude supplies are 6.4% below the year-ago period though they are in the upper half of the average range during this time of the year.Meanwhile, stocks at the Cushing terminal in Oklahoma – the key delivery hub for U.S. crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange – was down by 1.5 million barrels to 63.1 million barrels.The crude supply cover was down from 28.7 days in the previous week to 28.3 days. In the year-ago period, the supply cover was 31.2 days.Gasoline: Supplies of gasoline were up for the first time in four weeks as demand weakened. The 894,000 barrels addition – contrary to the polled number of 1 million barrels fall in supply level – took gasoline stockpiles up to 210.4 million barrels. Despite last week’s increase, the existing stock of the most widely used petroleum product remains 5.1% below the year-earlier level but is in the middle of the average range.Distillate: Distillate fuel supplies (including diesel and heating oil) went down by 799,000 barrels last week, compared with analysts’ expectations for 2 million barrels decrease in supply level. The marginal weekly fall could be attributed to weakening demand. At 124.8 million barrels, current supplies are 16.2% below the year-ago level and are in the bottom half of the average range for this time of the year.Refinery Rates: Refinery utilization was up by 1.4% from the prior week to 91%.About the Weekly Petroleum Status ReportThe Energy Information Administration (EIA) Petroleum Status Report, containing data of the previous week ending Friday, outlines information regarding the weekly change in petroleum inventories held and produced by the U.S., both locally and abroad.The report provides an overview of the level of reserves and their movements, thereby helping investors understand the demand/supply dynamics of petroleum products. It is an indicator of current oil prices and volatility that affect the businesses of the companies engaged in the oil and refining industry.The data from EIA generally acts as a catalyst for crude prices and affect producers, such as ExxonMobil Corp. (XOM  -  Free Report), Chevron Corp. (CVX  -  Free Report) and ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report), and refiners such as Valero Energy Corp.

Capital budget is estimated in the range of C$4.5-C$5 billion for 2018, much lower than C$5.4- C$5.6 billion guided for 2017.Suncor has allotted 25% of the total capital expenditure for its upstream growth projects. Moreover, the total plant turnaround at the Edmonton refinery is included in the company's 2018 capital program along with other downstream refineries' maintenance and oil sands upgrades.The company also said that it expects 2018 upstream production to average between 740,000 and 780,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (Boe/d), representing an increase of 10% year over year. Suncor expects its refinery utilization to be in the range of 90% to 94% for 2018. Focusing investments on these operations are expected to increase efficiency. The production guidance of the company does not include operations in Libya, which are still being impacted by political unrests.The rise in production and fall in capital expenditure are expected to enable Suncor Energy to return more free cash flow to its stockholders through share buybacks and dividends.In addition, Suncor Energy expects cash operating costs per barrel at Syncrude to be in the range of C$32.50 and C$35.50, while the same for Fort Hills - which was acquired from Total S.A.

1534,COP,"SCANA Corporation’s (SCG  -  Free Report) principal subsidiary — South Carolina Electric & Gas Company (“SCE&G”) — has announced plans to resolve issues relating to the abandoned V.C. Summer Station nuclear construction project.These plans are anticipated to reduce costs for customers and drive energy production. Total cost savings for SCE&G customers are estimated at about $4.8 billion. The solutions provided by the plan are listed below.The first step includes the rollback of residential electric rates back to March 2015 level. This will reduce rates by about $90 million per year, or 3.5%. The monthly bill of a customer using 1,000 kilowatt hours of electricity will be lowered by more than $5.In the next five decades, SCANA’s shareholders will absorb the net nuclear construction costs through lower earnings. This will lead to savings of about $2.9 billion. The plan also proposes the addition of a 540-megawatt, natural-gas-fired power plant to SCE&G’s system. This is expected to substitute more than 40% of the projected power that was to be provided to SCE&G from the V.C. Summer nuclear construction project. However, acquisition cost will be provided by SCANA’s shareholders. This will result in savings of $680 million, which includes purchase price of $180 million.A large-scale solar energy of about 100 megawatts will added to SCE&G’s system. This is expected to boost non-rooftop solar capacity by about 50%.Per the current estimates, if this proposal is implemented, an additional generation source will not be required for several years. This will be an important step to meet the growing needs of South Carolina.In a separate announcement, SCE&G has stated that it has inked an agreement in principle to acquire a 540-megawatt, combined-cycle, natural-gas-fired power plant from Columbia Energy LLC for $180 million. The company intends to complete the purchase in the upcoming weeks and regulatory approval are expected by 2018.Price MovementOver a year, the company’s shares have declined 35.4% as against the industry’s rally of 17.5%. Zacks Rank & Key PicksSCANA currently carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).

1537,COP,"Wall Street showed a strong revival from the vicious sell-off seen last week, with major indices back in the green territory for the year. Both the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 Index climbed for the fourth consecutive session, surging at least 4.5% each. In fact, the S&P 500 index witnessed the strongest four-day performance since mid-2016.This is especially true as inflation fears, which had sent the major indices to a correction territory, started to fizzle out following the latest inflation data. Although inflation rose faster than expected in January, year-over-year increase remained unchanged at 1.8%, setting the stage for no aggressive rates hike; the speculation of which has sent the major indices to a correction territory. Notably, the Fed plans to raise interest rates three times this year.Additionally, retail sales saw an unprecedented fall in January, recording the biggest drop in nearly a year. This has also eased inflationary pressure signaling that the economy is not overheated.Apart from this, encouraging fundamentals have rekindled the appeal for riskier assets. Strong corporate earnings, optimism on global growth and the euphoria surrounding the new tax legislation are acting as the key catalysts. A massive $1.5-trillion tax cut will create an economic surge, boosting job growth and reflation trade. It will further accelerate earnings, leading to increased dividend and buyback activities. Additionally, low unemployment, higher consumer spending and rising consumer confidence are adding to the strength.While there are several stocks to play the stock market rebound, we have presented five of them that tend to gain more than their counterparts.

1538,COP,"Marathon Oil Corporation (MRO  -  Free Report) – a leading upstream energy firm based in Houston, TX – posted fourth-quarter adjusted income of 7 cents per share, ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 2 cents. In the year-earlier quarter, the company incurred adjusted loss of 10 cents.The strong numbers came thanks to higher production and the recovery in crude prices. In particular, total quarterly output rose 12% year over year to 383,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day (BOE/d).Quarterly revenues of $1,382 million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,280 million and also rose from the prior-year quarter level of $1,124 million.Marathon Oil Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Marathon Oil Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Marathon Oil Corporation QuoteSegmental PerformanceUnited States E&P: Marathon Oil’s United States upstream segment reported a profit of $76 million, turning around from the loss of $91 million a year ago. Higher oil prices and production improved the results.Marathon Oil reported production available for sale of 262,000 BOE/d, up from 212,000 BOE/d in the fourth quarter of 2016. The improvement was mainly due impressive contribution from U.S. resource plays.The company realized liquids (crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids) price of $47.61 per barrel, 22.1% higher than the year-earlier quarter level of $39.00 per barrel. But natural gas realizations decreased 7.7% year over year to $2.65 per thousand cubic feet (Mcf). International E&P: The segment’s income increased 7.3% year over year to $118 million. Substantially higher liquids realizations led to the profit growth.Marathon Oil -- which spun off its refining/sales business into a separate, independent and publicly traded company Marathon Petroleum Corporation (MPC  -  Free Report) in 2011 -- reported production available for sale (excluding Libya) of 121,000 BOE/d, down from the 129,000 BOE/d in the fourth quarter of 2016. The decrease in output could be blamed on the temporary shut-down of the third party-operated Forties Pipeline System, natural field declines and planned turnaround activity in the U.K.The company realized liquids price of $51.13 per barrel, reflecting a 35.1% rise from the year-earlier quarter level of $37.85 per barrel. Also, natural gas realizations were up 11.3% year over year to 59 cents per thousand cubic feet (Mcf).Costs & ExpensesThe company’s exploration expenses for the quarter came at $57 million, higher than $34 million in the year-earlier quarter. Moreover, Marathon Oil’s total quarterly cost and expenses rose 7.3% to 1,174 million.Capital ExpenditureDuring the year, Marathon Oil spent $2,100 million on capital programs, in line with its guidance. The company announced a 2018 capital program of $2,300 million, with 90% of the outlay earmarked for high return U.S. resource plays.GuidanceMarathon Oil expects first-quarter 2018 United States E&P output available for sale in the range of 265,000–275,000 BOE/d and International E&P output in the range of 105,000–115,000 BOE/d.For the full year, Marathon Oil forecasts sale-ready output from the combined United States and International E&P segments to average 390,000 to 410,000 net BOE/d.Zacks Rank & Stock PicksMarathon Oil holds a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Meanwhile, one can look at a better-ranked energy players like ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report) and Occidental Petroleum Corporation (OXY  -  Free Report), both sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

1539,COP,"The U.S. Energy Department's inventory release showed that crude stockpiles recorded a second straight weekly build. On a further bearish note, gasoline and distillate inventories rose, too.However, the talking point from the data sets was the steady trend of rising domestic oil production that continues to be the biggest headwind for the market. EIA revealed that weekly U.S. crude output jumped above 10 million barrels a day for the first time since 1970. This has refueled concerns that the domestic supply glut is cancelling out cuts from OPEC and its allies.As a result, the front month West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures moved down 2.5% (or $1.6) to end at $61.79 per barrel yesterday – the lowest settlement since Jan 8.Investors Dump Energy StocksThe federal data sparked widespread selling in energy stocks, which pushed the Energy Select Sector SPDR – an assortment of the largest U.S. energy companies – down almost 1.7% Wednesday.The two energy representatives in the 30-stock Dow Jones industrial average, ExxonMobil Corp. (XOM  -  Free Report) and Chevron Corp. (CVX  -  Free Report) lost 1.8% and 1.6%, respectively, yesterday. Meanwhile, some of the biggest casualties of the S&P 500 were oil and oil-related stocks like Southwestern Energy Co. (SWN  -  Free Report), Chesapeake Energy Corp. (CHK  -  Free Report), Marathon Oil Corp. (MRO  -  Free Report) and Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO  -  Free Report).Analysis of the EIA DataCrude Oil: The federal government’s EIA report revealed that crude inventories rose by 1.9 million barrels for the week ending Feb 2, following an increase of 6.8 million barrels in the previous week. The analysts surveyed by S&P Global Platts – the leading independent commodities and energy data provider – had expected crude stocks to go up some 2.8 million barrels.Record high domestic production led to the stockpile build with the world's biggest oil consumer. This was partly offset by lower imports and higher refiner demand, which helped restrict the inventory injection below expectations.In particular, U.S. output rose by 332,000 barrels per day last week to more than 10.2 million barrels per day – the most since the EIA started maintaining weekly data in 1983 and the first time in nearly 50 years that oil production broke through the 10 million barrels a day threshold.While oil inventories rose for a second successive week, stockpiles have shrunk in 34 of the last 44 weeks and are down more than 110 million barrels since April. The gradual fall has helped the U.S. crude market shift from year-over-year storage surplus to a deficit. At 420.3 million barrels, current crude supplies are 17.4% below the year-ago period though they are in the middle of the average range during this time of the year.Meanwhile, stocks at the Cushing terminal in Oklahoma – the key delivery hub for U.S. crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange – was down by 711,000 barrels to three-year lows of 36.3 million barrels.The crude supply cover was up from 25.1 days in the previous week to 25.4 days. In the year-ago period, the supply cover was 31.6 days.Gasoline: Gasoline supplies recorded their twelfth increase in 13 weeks on the strength of production and imports. The 3.4 million barrels addition – significantly above the polled number of 200,000 barrels rise in supply level – took gasoline stockpiles up to 245.5 million barrels. Despite last week’s increase, the stock of the most widely used petroleum product remains 4.2% below the year-earlier level and is in the middle of the average range.Distillate: Distillate fuel supplies (including diesel and heating oil) gained 3.9 million barrels last week, contrary to analysts’ expectations for 800,000 barrels decrease in supply level. The weekly rise could be attributed to tepid demand and strong production. But at 141.8 million barrels, current supplies are still 16.9% below the year-ago level and are in the middle of the average range for this time of the year.Refinery Rates: Refinery utilization was up by 4.4% from the prior week to 92.5%.About the Weekly Petroleum Status ReportThe Energy Information Administration (EIA) Petroleum Status Report, containing data of the previous week ending Friday, outlines information regarding the weekly change in petroleum inventories held and produced by the U.S., both locally and abroad.The report provides an overview of the level of reserves and their movements, thereby helping investors understand the demand/supply dynamics of petroleum products. It is an indicator of current oil prices and volatility that affect the businesses of the companies engaged in the oil and refining industry.The data from EIA generally acts as a catalyst for crude prices and affect producers, such as ExxonMobil Corp. (XOM  -  Free Report), Chevron Corp. (CVX  -  Free Report) and ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report), and refiners such as Valero Energy Corp. (VLO  -  Free Report), Phillips 66 (PSX) and Marathon Petroleum Corp.

1540,COP,"We are in the thick of the Q4 earnings season, with 251 S&P 500 members having reported so far. Up until now, the energy sector has witnessed year-over-year earnings growth of 146% in the fourth quarter, courtesy of a partial recovery in crude prices. Leading oil players like Chevron (CVX  -  Free Report), ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report) and Pioneer Natural Resources Company (PXD  -  Free Report) managed to hike quarterly dividends, following an improvement in Q4 results.British energy giant BP plc (BP  -  Free Report) also saw its fourth-quarter earnings skyrocket from the prior year. However, the integrated energy firm maintained its dividend payment even though analysts were expecting it to announce a dividend hike along with quarterly results.That does not mean that BP is not fundamentally strong enough to raise dividends. In fact, our research shows that the company has the potential to hike dividend in the near term.Dividends Consistent Despite Crude DownturnThe market has experienced a downturn in crude prices, after average monthly crude prices fell below the $100-per-barrel mark in August 2014.Excess supply of oil amid lackluster global demand led to multi-year lows for the commodity. The concurrent race for market share among leading crude exporters like Russia, Saudis, and US shale players resulted in crude languishing in bearish territory.Subsequently, energy players experienced trouble sustaining their businesses, ending up with huge debt loads. Eventually, many energy firms were compelled to stop paying dividends. Though BP couldn’t escape the situation, it did reasonably well when compared to others.BP has been paying dividends to American Depositary Share (ADS) holders for 13 quarters in a row despite persistent crude weakness. ADS holders will again receive dividend payments on Mar 29, 2018 as announced by the company along with its fourth-quarter 2017 results, the quantum of which has been maintained.Investors should note that even though BP’s adjusted earnings per ADS was $1.94, 83 cents, and $1.88 in 2015, 2016, and 2017, respectively, the annual dividend of $2.40 paid during each of the respective three years was comparatively higher.The picture clearly shows that BP has been distributing dividends in excess of their earnings, a trend which may not be sustainable. In fact, the company's current dividend yield of 5.9% is much higher than the industry’s 3.8%. In other words, the era of low crude prices and the oil spill incident of 2010 in the BP-operated Macondo Prospect – events which are still affecting the company –  could not deter BP from paying shareholders steady dividends.Can Investors Expect a Dividend Hike?Since the beginning of 2018, crude has been trading above the $60-per-barrel psychological mark. Notably, for the first time after 2014, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude started off the year above $60 a barrel. We view this as a partial recovery for oil prices, thanks to the extension of the production cut deal by OPEC players.On Nov 30, 2017, OPEC members met non-OPEC players to decide on an extension of the crude production cut accord, first signed in late 2016, beyond the first quarter of 2018. More than 20 oil producers, including leading exporters like Russia and Saudi Arabia, participated in the meeting. As expected by most analysts, all crude exporters decided to extend the deal through 2018-end. Saudi Arabia, Russia, and their allies have pledged to put 1.8 million barrels a day of crude oil out of market.The improvement in crude price is favorable for BP as the company has a portfolio of major upstream projects. Last year, BP brought online seven key projects — Khazzan Phase 1, Zohr, Juniper, Persephone, Quad 204, Trinidad Onshore Compression and West Nile Delta - Taurus / Libra — which helped the firm produce record volumes of oil and gas during the October-to-December quarter. In fact, fourth-quarter 2017 production touched the highest mark since the January-to-March quarter of 2011.BP is also expected to bring online five more upstream developments in 2018. All these projects along with the developments placed online during 2016 will likely help the energy giant add 800,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day to net production capacity by 2020.All those developments are reflected in the company’s healthy pricing chart. Over the past year, BP has rallied 18%, outperforming the industry’s 8.2% gain. Hence, there are strong reasons to believe BP will be able to boost shareholder’s dividends in the near term.  BP carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1541,COP,"It was a week where both oil and gas prices tallied losses.On the news front, U.S.-based integrated majors ExxonMobil Corp. (XOM  -  Free Report) and Chevron Corp. (CVX  -  Free Report) came up with weaker-than-expected earnings reports despite higher oil prices. However, their European counterpart Royal Dutch Shell plc (RDS.A  -  Free Report) bucked the trend and reported strong numbers, helped by rebounding commodity prices and cost cuts.Overall, it was a dismal week for the sector. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures lost about 1% to close at $65.45 per barrel, while natural gas prices dived more than 10% to $2.846 per million Btu (MMBtu). (See the last ‘Oil & Gas Stock Roundup’ here: Valero and Marathon Hikes Dividends, Helmerich & Payne Reports Q1)The U.S. oil benchmark recorded its second decrease in three weeks. The major culprit was the steady trend of rising domestic oil production that continues to be the biggest headwind for the market.As per EIA’s latest data, U.S. output rose by 384,000 barrels per day in November to 10.038 million barrels per day – the first time in nearly 50 years that oil production broke through the 10 million barrels a day threshold. This has refueled concerns that the domestic supply glut is cancelling out cuts from OPEC and its allies.Data showing the number of U.S. oil rigs climbing for a second straight week brought further downside.Meanwhile, natural gas had a forgettable week of its own following a smaller-than-expected decrease in supplies. The 99 billion cubic feet (Bcf) withdrawal was also lower than the five-year (2013-2017) average net shrinkage of 160 Bcf for the reported week.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    Energy giant ExxonMobil posted lower-than-expected results in fourth-quarter 2017, thanks to weak refinery throughput. This was partially offset by higher liquid price realizations. The company reported adjusted earnings of 88 cents per share, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.06. Also, the bottom line fell from the year-ago quarter level of 90 cents.Production averaged 3.991 million barrels of oil-equivalent per day (MMBOE/d), lower than 4.121 MMBOE/d in the year-ago quarter. Liquid production fell year over year to 2.251 million barrels per day. However, natural gas production was 10.441 MMCF/d (millions of cubic feet per day), up from 10.424 MMCF/d in the year-ago period.During the quarter under review, ExxonMobil generated cash flow of $8.8 billion from operations and asset divestments. The energy giant returned $3.3 billion to shareholders through dividends. Capital and exploration spending surged more than 100% year over year to almost $7.6 billion. (Read more ExxonMobil Misses Q4 Earnings on Lower Throughput)2.    Smaller rival Chevron reported weaker-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings after excluding the impacts of U.S. tax reform. The company reported adjusted earnings per share of 73 cents, lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.27. However, the bottom line improved significantly from the year-ago profit of 22 cents amid the recovery in oil prices and production gains.Chevron’s total production of crude oil and natural gas increased 2.7% compared with last year’s corresponding period to 2,740 thousand oil-equivalent barrels per day (MBOE/d). The U.S. output fell 1.6% year over year to 671 MBOE/d but the company’s international operations (accounting for 76% of the total) was up 4.1% to 2,069 MBOE/d.Importantly, Chevron delivered a good cash flow performance this quarter – an important gauge for the oil and gas industry – with $6,230 million in cash flow from operations, up from $3,863 million a year ago. (Read more Chevron Q4 Earnings Jump, Helped by Rising Oil Price)3.    Europe’s largest oil company Royal Dutch Shell plc reported strong fourth-quarter results on all round contribution from all its segments. In particular, rebounding commodity prices and cost cuts helped the company in coming out with better-than-expected numbers.During the quarter under review, Shell generated cash flow from operations of $7,275 million, returned $3,900 million to shareholders through dividends and spent $6,778 million on capital projects. Despite falling from the year-ago period, the company’s resilient cash generation has helped it to cover dividend payments.Shell has already aborted its two-and-a half-year long scrip dividend program as cost-containment efforts and divestment strategies have paid off. Importantly, the group raked in $6,610 million in free cash flow during the fourth quarter, up from $5,741 million a year ago.As of Dec 31, 2017, the company had $20,312 million in cash and $85,665 million in debt (including short-term debt). Net debt-to-capitalization ratio was approximately 24.8%, down from 28% a year ago following the BG Group acquisition. The improvement in the group’s debt ratio was helped by cost cuts and asset sales. (Read more Shell's Q4 Earnings Jump After Oil Prices Recover)4.    Upstream energy player ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report) reported fourth-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of 45 cents per share, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. In the prior-year quarter, the company had posted a loss of 26 cents. The fourth-quarter results were supported by higher oil and natural gas price realizations.Production from continuing operations averaged 1,256 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (MBOED) in the quarter, lower than 1,596 MBOED in the year-ago quarter. The decline was led by planned divestment of assets.As of Dec 31, 2017, the company had total cash and cash equivalents of $6.3 billion and debt of $19.7 billion, with a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 39%. In the reported quarter, ConocoPhillips generated $2.5 billion in cash from operating activities. Capital expenditures and investments totaled $1.5 billion and dividends payments grossed $319 million.ConocoPhillips got an approval from the board of directors to hike the quarterly dividend to 28.5 cents per share from 26.5 cents, representing an increase of 7.5%. The company also enhanced its share buyback program. With this, ConocoPhillips will increase share repurchases during 2018 to $2 billion from the prior projection of $1.5 billion. (Read more: ConocoPhillips Q4 Earnings Meet, Revenues Top Estimates)5.    Marathon Petroleum Corp. (MPC  -  Free Report) reported strong fourth-quarter 2017 results on higher refining margin. The Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company’s earnings per share came in at $1.05, above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.00. Earnings surged from the year-ago period's figure by 144.2%. Specifically, refining margin of $13.12 per barrel increased versus $11.31 a year ago. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Operating income from the Refining & Marketing segment — which is the main contributor to Marathon Petroleum earnings — was $732 million compared with $166 million in the year-ago quarter. The jump reflects wider crack spread leading to stronger refining margin and higher capacity utilization.In the quarter, Marathon Petroleum spent $956 million on capital programs (51% on the Midstream segment). As of Dec 31, 2017, the company had cash and cash equivalents of $3,011 million and total debt of $12,946 million, with a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 38.4%. During the quarter under review, Marathon Petroleum returned $945 million of capital to shareholders, including $750 million of share repurchases.

1542,COP,"ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report) recently struck two deals in Alaska. The company divested its Kenai liquefied natural gas (LNG) facility to Andeavor (ANDV  -  Free Report). In another deal, ConocoPhillips acquired stake in Western North Slope of Alaska from Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (APC  -  Free Report).About the DivestmentConocoPhillips has already closed the divestiture as it transferred Kenai operations to Andeavor on Jan 31, 2018. The financial details of the deal are yet to be disclosed. With the sale of the Kenai assets, ConocoPhillips completed its retreat from the Cook Inlet region.Divestment RationaleConocoPhillips started its search for a company to divest its Kenai LNG plant toward the end of 2016. The divestiture will enable ConocoPhillips to shift its focus to North Slope region operations. Notably, ConocoPhillips is investing in new projects in the North Slope region like GMT-1 and GMT-2, which have bright future. While GMT-1 is in its final construction phase and expected to come online this year, GMT-2 awaits federal approval.Apart from concentrating on more profitable assets, the deal is also expected to strengthen ConocoPhillips' balance sheet and reduce its leverage, which is one of the best in the industry. As of Dec 31, 2017, the company had a total debt of $19.7 billion, with a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 39%.About the AcquisitionConcurrent with its fourth quarter 2017 earnings, ConocoPhillips' announced that  it will buy Anadarko Petroleum's 22% non-operating stake in the Western North Slope of Alaska and its interest in the Alpine pipeline for a cash consideration of $400 million. In 2017, production from these assets was 63 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (MBOED). The acquisition reflects ConocoPhillips’ optimism on North Slope oil prospects. The company expects the Trans Alaska Pipeline System to carry more new oil in the coming years.Price PerformanceConocoPhillips has gained 15.2% in the last year against the 14.7% fall of its industry.About ConocoPhillipsHouston, TX-based ConocoPhillips is a major global exploration and production (E&P) company with operations and activities in several countries that include the U.S., Canada, the U.K./Norway, China, Australia, offshore Timor-Leste, Indonesia, Libya, Nigeria, Algeria, Russia and Qatar. The company is involved in exploration, development and production of crude oil and natural gas worldwide.We also appreciate the company’s initiative to divest non-core assets as the explorer could use the proceeds in the lucrative Eagle Ford shale and Permian Basin. The proceeds will also help the upstream company lower debt that has accumulated owing to the persistent slump in oil for more than three years.It is to be noted that during 2017, ConocoPhillips generated $16 billion from the asset sale program. However, the company’s 2018 production guidance, which is in the range of 1,195 to 1,235 MBOED is lower than the production of 1,377 MBOED in 2017.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderConocoPhillips has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked stock in the oil and energy sector is Cabot Oil & Gas (COG  -  Free Report).  It sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Houston, TX -based Cabot is an independent energy company.

1543,COP,"ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report) reported fourth-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of 45 cents per share, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. In the prior-year quarter, the company had posted a loss of 26 cents.Revenues of $8,736 million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7,698 million and improved from $7,254 million in the year-ago quarter.The fourth-quarter results were supported by higher oil and natural gas price realizations. Hike in Dividend & Share Repurchases ConocoPhillips got an approval from the board of directors to hike the quarterly dividend to 28.5 cents per share from 26.5 cents, representing an increase of 7.5%. The new dividend will likely be paid on Mar 1 to stockholders of record as of Feb 12.The company also enhanced its share buyback program. With this, ConocoPhillips will increase share repurchases during 2018 to $2 billion from the prior projection of $1.5 billion.Exploration and ProductionProduction from continuing operations averaged 1,256 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (MBOED) in the quarter, lower than 1,596 MBOED in the year-ago quarter. The decline was led by planned divestment of assets.Price RealizationAverage realized price for oil was $58.99 a barrel, up from $47.05 in the year-earlier quarter. Natural gas liquids were sold at $32.79 a barrel, up from $21.82 in the year-ago quarter. The price of natural gas was $4.59 per thousand cubic feet, compared with $3.44 in fourth-quarter 2016.FinancialsAs of Dec 31, 2017, the company had total cash and cash equivalents of $6.3 billion and debt of $19.7 billion, with a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 39%.

1544,COP,"Q4 Earnings On Roll, Q4 Productivity Miss Estimates
"
1545,COP,"Ahead of Thursday’s opening bell, we see market futures again wallowing in negative territory, after strong Q4 earnings helped Wednesday trading make back some of the losses from earlier in the week. And, it being Thursday, we see new Initial Jobless Claims from a week ago, plus fresh Q4 Productivity results.New jobless claims fell to 230K from a downwardly revised 231K the previous week. This is lower than expected, and stays directly within the sweet spot of a healthy U.S. labor market. For the past dozen quarters or so — give or take hurricane effects and other short-term realities — we have seen jobless numbers between 225K-250K, again consistent with robust domestic employment.Continuing claims remained relatively high, however, at 1.953 million from the previous week. We have not crossed the 2 million continuing claims threshold in quite some time, but the narrative remains: fewer near-term claims and steady longer-term jobless claims have been dominant themes in the jobs market.Q4 Productivity Lower than ExpectedThe new preliminary read on Q4 Productivity disappointed, falling to -0.1% from an expected +1.0%. Granted, a pullback from Q3’s stronger 3% — which itself was downwardly revised to 2.7% — was expected, but not into negative territory. Then again, we are looking at a preliminary view of the Q4 tally, so the possibility of an upward revision in future reads is something we’ll be considering in the future.And as productivity reportedly fell, Unit Labor Costs for Q4 naturally rose — to 2% from the 1% expected. Through 2017, productivity has averaged 1.2% relative to 2016. While it’s good this figure is in positive territory, we again see that productivity and strong job growth in the U.S. (witness ADP’s 234K new private-sector jobs reported for January, following an even better 242K the previous month) not completely aligned.Again, when the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) releases its non-farm payroll results for January tomorrow morning, we’ll be keying on the Average Wage Growth number, which is expected to continue to go up, albeit very gradually. Aside from the other ways to breakdown these important labor market numbers, analysts have been looking for wage growth to take hold for, literally, years — with little to show for it since jobs figures began to notably improve.Q4 Earnings RoundupDue to the monstrous amount of earnings reports coming out both after yesterday’s close and before this morning’s opening bell, we will keep our focus to those stocks with strong Zacks Ranks:Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy)-based United Parcel Service (UPS  -  Free Report) beat estimates on both its top- and bottom-lines, reaching $1.67 per share (2 cents higher than anticipated) on $18.83 billion in quarterly revenues, which was significantly higher than the $18.19 billion expected. Full-year earnings guidance for 2018 is in a range between $7.03-7.37 per share; the Zacks consensus previously had been for $706 per share. For more on UPS’ earnings, click here.Marathon Petroleum (MPC  -  Free Report), another Zacks Rank #1 stock with a Zacks Style Score (Value, Growth, Momentum) of A, also outperformed in its Q4 report, beating earnings estimates by 5 cents to $1.05 per share, with revenues surpassing estimates to $21.24 billion from the $19.70 billion expected. For more on MPC’s earnings, click here.Oil & Gas integrated supermajor ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report) only managed to meet bottom-line estimates of 45 cents per share, though quarterly revenues were well out in front of expectations — $87.36 billion easily topped the $76.98 billion we had been looking for. Biggest among elements positively affecting the quarter was Conoco’s Refining & Marketing business, which zoomed ahead from $166 million a year ago to $732 million in Q4. For more on COP’s earnings, click here.

1547,COP,"Leading exploration and production company, ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report) is set to release its fourth-quarter 2017 financial results, before the opening bell on Feb 1, 2018.Last quarter, the company delivered an impressive 77.8% positive earnings surprise on the back of higher oil and natural gas price realizations. The company also came up with a positive average  surprise of 152.3% in the last four quarters. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.ConocoPhillips Price and EPS Surprise ConocoPhillips Price and EPS Surprise | ConocoPhillips QuoteWhich Way Are Estimates Trending?Let’s look at estimate revisions in order to get a clearer picture of analyst opinion on the stock before the earnings release.The Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased from 40 cents per share for the fourth quarter to 45 cents in the last 30 days. While two firms are bearish on the stock, four firms are bullish. The estimate reflects a year-over-year improvement of about 273.1%.Factors Likely to Influence this QuarterThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for average sale price of natural gas is $4.70 per thousand cubic feet (Mcf), higher than last quarter’s $4.11 per Mcf and the year-ago quarter’s $3.44 per Mcf. However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for natural gas production for the fourth quarter has declined to 2,793 million cubic feet per day (Mmcfd) from 2,918 Mmcfd in the last quarter and 3,863 Mmcfd in the year-ago quarter.The average sales price of natural gas liquids for the fourth quarter is estimated to be $30.20 per barrel, higher than last quarter’s reported price of $23.82 per barrel and $21.82 per barrel in the year-ago quarter. However, production is expected to fall to 94 thousand barrel per day (MBD) from third-quarter production of 95 MBD and the year-ago quarter’s production of 143 MBD.Average crude oil sales price is expected to be $55 per barrel, higher than third quarter’s $49.39 per barrel and the year-ago quarter’s price of $47.05. Moreover, production of crude oil per day for the fourth quarter is expected to rise to 604 MBD from previous quarter’s 420 MBD and the year-ago quarter’s 596 MBD.Though we expect average realized prices in the fourth quarter to increase for all the commodities, their production is expected to decrease, except crude oil output. The fall in production can be primarily attributed to the company’s asset sales in 2017. These divestures include the sale of mining operations in Foster Creek Christina Lake oil sands and Western Canada’s Deep Basin gas assets. The company also closed the divesture deals of San Juan asset and Barnett asset in the third quarter of 2017. Hence, it is difficult to conclusively predict the net impact on fourth-quarter results.Q4 Price PerformanceConocoPhillips gained 9.6% in the fourth quarter compared with 9.4% growth of its industry.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that ConocoPhillipsis likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Unfortunately, that is not the case here as elaborated below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is -10.30%. While the Most Accurate estimate stands at 40 cents, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged higher at 45 cents.Zacks Rank: ConocoPhillips has a Zacks Rank #2,which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and 5 (Strong Sell) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies that you may consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Houston, TX -based Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation (COG  -  Free Report) is an independent energy company. Its Earnings ESP is +15.15% and the stock sports a Zacks Rank #1.Suncor Energy Inc. (SU  -  Free Report) is a Calgary, Canada based integrated energy company. Its Earnings ESP is +12.44% and it carries a Zacks Rank #1.Irving, TX-based Pioneer Natural Resources Company (PXD  -  Free Report) is an independent oil and gas exploration and production company. The company has an Earnings ESP of +4.85% and it sports a Zacks Rank #1.Zacks Top 10 Stocks for 2018 In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest buy-and-hold tickers for the entirety of 2018?Last year's 2017 Zacks Top 10 Stocks portfolio produced double-digit winners, including FMC Corp. and VMware which racked up stellar gains of +67.9% and +61%.

1548,COP,"The U.S. Energy Department's inventory release showed that crude stockpiles recorded another weekly draw to the lowest level since 2015. As a result, the front month West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures moved up 1.8% (or $1.14) to end at $65.61 per barrel yesterday – the highest settlement since December 2014.But the positive effect from the record tenth straight crude inventory withdrawal was partly offset by builds in gasoline and distillate supplies. On a further bearish note, domestic oil production revisited its rising trend that continues to be the biggest headwind for the market.Analysis of the EIA DataCrude Oil: The federal government’s EIA report revealed that crude inventories fell by 1.1 million barrels for the week ending Jan 19, following a decrease of 6.9 million barrels in the previous week. The analysts surveyed by S&P Global Platts – the leading independent commodities and energy data provider – had expected crude stocks to go down some 1.6 million barrels.An uptick in exports led to the stockpile draw with the world's biggest oil consumer. However, the withdrawal failed to match expectations as U.S. output edged up 128,000 barrels per day last week to 9.9 million barrels per day – tantalizingly close to the all-time record of just over 10 million barrels per day set in 1970.Oil stockpiles have shrunk in 34 of the last 42 weeks and are down almost 122 million barrels since April. The gradual fall has helped the U.S. crude market shift from year-over-year storage surplus to a deficit. At 411.6 million barrels, current crude supplies are 15.7% below the year-ago period and the lowest since February 2015 though they are in the middle of the average range during this time of the year.Meanwhile, stocks at the Cushing terminal in Oklahoma – the key delivery hub for U.S. crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange – was down by 3.2 million barrels to three-year lows of 39.2 million barrels.The crude supply cover was up from 23.9 days in the previous week to 24.1 days. In the year-ago period, the supply cover was 29.5 days.Gasoline: Supplies of gasoline were up for the eleventh straight week on the strength of imports. The 3.1 million barrels addition – more than the polled number of 2.1 million barrels rise in supply level – took gasoline stockpiles up to 244 million barrels. Despite last week’s increase, the stock of the most widely used petroleum product remains 3.6% below the year-earlier level and is in the middle of the average range.Distillate: Distillate fuel supplies (including diesel and heating oil) gained 639,000 barrels last week, contrary to analysts’ expectations for 2.5 million barrels decrease in supply level. The weekly rise could be attributed to tepid demand. But at 139.8 million barrels, current supplies are still 17.3% below the year-ago level and are in the lower half of the average range for this time of the year.Refinery Rates: Refinery utilization was down by 2.1% from the prior week to 90.9%.About the Weekly Petroleum Status ReportThe Energy Information Administration (EIA) Petroleum Status Report, containing data of the previous week ending Friday, outlines information regarding the weekly change in petroleum inventories held and produced by the U.S., both locally and abroad.The report provides an overview of the level of reserves and their movements, thereby helping investors understand the demand/supply dynamics of petroleum products. It is an indicator of current oil prices and volatility that affect the businesses of the companies engaged in the oil and refining industry.The data from EIA generally acts as a catalyst for crude prices and affect producers, such as ExxonMobil Corp. (XOM  -  Free Report), Chevron Corp. (CVX  -  Free Report) and ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report), and refiners such as Valero Energy Corp. (VLO  -  Free Report), Phillips 66 (PSX  -  Free Report) and Marathon Petroleum Corp.

1549,COP,"Noble Energy Inc. (NBL  -  Free Report) has announced plans to strengthen and expand in Israel through production operations ahead of the 2019, according to a report by Reuters. The production operations will begin at the large Leviathan natural gas site close to Israel's Mediterranean coast at the end of 2019.Per another media report, the company is leasing nine floors in the Herzliya Hills office project, to support its expanding operations and increasing work force in Israel. Noble Energy will lease the offices for 10 years with an option to extend the lease by a further 14 years. The company will move into its new Herzliya Hills offices in 2019.Noble Energy’s Position in IsraelThe company already holds 40% of Leviathan gas site, which has estimated gas reserves of 622 billion cubic meters, while Delek Group Ltd.  owns 45% of the same through subsidiaries. Additionally, Noble Energy holds 32.5% of the Tamar field, Israel's primary reserve of natural gas.Noble Energy is currently focused on strengthening operations in Israel. Notably, the company has spent 20% of the capital expenditure toward development operations for the Leviathan development, during the third quarter. At present, Noble Energy has gained the required permission to progress with the remaining of its Leviathan development work of which 23% has been already completed.During the third quarter, the company witnessed a rise in gross recoverable resources by 10% to 11 trillion cubic feet equivalent (Tcfe) of natural gas in the Tamar Field. Further, higher gas demand was also witnessed owing to the addition of more industrial customers in Jordan during the third quarter.  It was also aided by demand from Israel due to the government mandate of reducing coal-fired power generation.Going aheadNoble Energy expects to invest in the range of $600-$700 million in the fourth quarter. Additionally, natural gas volumes are anticipated higher at 1,005-1,045 million cubic feet of natural gas per day while natural gas liquids (NGLs) are expected to be between 69 thousand barrels per day (MBbl/d) and 74 MBbl/d.Further, the possibility of extracting higher gas volumes in existing assets of the Tamar Field is expected to bode well with the growing demand of natural gas in Eastern Mediterranean region. However, the company will have to reduce its holding in Tamar field to 25% by 2021 as government plans to open the market to competition.Per management’s opinion, higher recovery of gas from Leviathan at the end of 2019 and the continued operations in Tamar are expected to boost Noble Energy's operations in Israel. Along with operations in Israel, its operations in Big Bend, Dantzler and Gunflint fields in Gulf of Mexico, West Africa and Equatorial Guinea are expected to aid the company in achieving production target for 2017.Price MovementNoble Energy has underperformed the industry in last six months.

1550,COP,"Statoil ASA  awarded twin contracts on the Norwegian Continental Shelf (NCS) to Aker Solutions for a total of NOK 1.5-2 billion.The awards are related to EPC contracts for the delivery of subsea production systems and services for the Troll Phase 3 project in the North Sea and the Askeladd project in the Barents Sea, respectively.

1551,COP,"The S&P 500 topped a 54-year old record for all-time highs in January. The broader index, in fact, met and exceeded Wall Street analysts’ projected average of 2,819 by the end of this year in just about 14 days of trading. Such relentless rally is merely an indication of a bull market that has an ability to discard any geo-political headwind.The index has been supported by a flurry of tailwinds. Corporate earnings results have so far exceeded expectations, assuring investors that in spite of anxieties over high valuations, demand remains healthy. A series of strong economic data and euphoria over the Republican-led tax cut also helped the benchmark scale north.Given the bullish trend, investing in sound stocks listed on the index seems alluring at the moment. These stocks not only outpaced the broader index so far this year but are also slated to gain further in the near term.S&P 500 Tops 54-Year Old RecordThe S&P 500 scaled the 12th record close so far in January, topping the previous high of 11 since 1964, according to the WSJ Market Data Group. The broader index ended in the green in 12 of the 15 trading sessions this year.In fact, the index has posted its longest stretch without a 5% pullback. This reflects the equity market’s resilience in recent times. The index had risen 19.4% in 2017, its best year since 2013. The index has continued its winning run for 14 straight months. It also posted 62 record closing highs last year, the second-highest number in its history. In fact, the index posted 77 record closes in 1995, the best year so far.Equities Supported by a Series of TailwindsThe index’s stellar run came at a time when market volatility has essentially been nonexistent. Astute investors have shrugged off all kind of political uncertainty. Instead, they focused on upbeat corporate earnings results, accelerating economic growth both domestically and abroad, and the recently passed tax overhaul policy.Q4 Earnings to See Strong GrowthThe Q4 earnings season kicked off on a positive note. For the 53 S&P 500 members that have reported results already, earnings are up 11.7% from the same period last year on 7.5% higher revenues, with 81.1% beating EPS estimates and 75.5% surpassing revenue estimates. In fact, Q4 earnings among all sectors are expected to be up 10.3% from the same period last year on 7.1% higher revenues. This will follow the 6.7% earnings growth recorded in the Q3 of 2017 on 5.9% higher revenues.Estimates for Q4 earnings for most of the sectors are expected to be positive, with Energy, Industrial Products, Basic Materials and Technology poised to post strong gains. An uptick in oil output is expected to boost the energy sector, while a rise in sales on housing demand post-hurricanes will drive manufacturing activities. Meanwhile, substantial growth in cloud computing, the Internet of Things and artificial intelligence are cited to be some of the reasons that will benefit the tech sector.Solid Economic DataEconomic recovery worldwide gave a boost to profitability, reduced the jobless rate to 4.1% and lifted consumer confidence to a 17-year high last November. Lynn Franco, director of economic indicators at the Conference Board, added that “consumers’ expectations remain at historically strong levels, suggesting economic growth will continue well into 2018.”Lest we forget, workers’ pay has increased 2.5% from December 2016 to December 2017. Such a low level of unemployment, rise in income and more confident consumers drove spending at both online and bricks-and-mortar stores as well as restaurants. In fact, spending might get a boost from the $1.5-trillion package of tax cuts approved by the Republican-controlled U.S. Congress and signed into law by President Trump last month. These massive tax cuts will drive household income and in turn increase the propensity to consume.Tax Overhaul EffectsThe corporate tax rate will be lowered from 35% to 21% and will be implemented this year, instead of being delayed till 2019. At the same time, any income brought back from overseas will be taxed 8-15.5%, instead of the current 35%.Lowering of domestic tax rates will boost profits, while a one-time low tax rate on foreign profits will encourage companies to bring funds held overseas back to the United States. This will help such companies carry out a combination of share buybacks, dividend payments and M&A activities.5 Top WinnersGiven the S&P 500’s record breaking run, investors should double down on the hottest stocks from the said index. We have, therefore, selected five such companies that flaunt a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).Seagate Technology plc (STX  -  Free Report) provides data storage technology and solutions in the United States and internationally. The stock has a Zacks Rank #2. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings increased 8.7% over the last 60 days.

1552,COP,"TransCanada Corporation (TRP  -  Free Report) recently obtained 20-year commitments from various oil companies to ship around 500,000 barrels a day through its Keystone XL pipeline. The commercial commitment amounts to around 60% of the total capacity of 830,000 barrels a day, reflecting gradual increasing customer support for the pipeline.The company received strong support from the Alberta government which has committed 50,000 barrels a day. The move has provided TransCanada the much-needed impetus to move forward with the project; however, the company has not made any official announcement yet. Late last year, the company declared that it needed to obtain shipments of at least 500,000 barrels for the project to be feasible. The company was to make its final decision regarding the construction and completion of the project by December 2017. However, it has not green-lit the project yet and is currently evaluating Nebraska’s decision to examine the economics of the project.Significance of the ProjectThe $8-billion Keystone XL pipeline with 830,000 barrels capacity is designed to improve oil extraction from Alberta’s oil sands and the Bakken region in the U.S. refineries. Both these areas have witnessed huge production growth over the last decade.The pipeline will ultimately reach Gulf of Mexico refineries. Western Canadian crude producers primarily use the train route to move their oil, which is costlier than movement through a pipeline. Completion of this project is expected to reduce crude shipment prices for producers and enhance their bottom line.In November 2015, President Obama turned down TransCanada's application to construct the Keystone XL pipeline on fears that it would weaken United States’ position in the international climate change negotiations. Obama had backed the argument of environmental groups that Keystone would encourage use of carbon-heavy tar sands oil, increasing global warming. However, in 2017, the project was cleared by President Trump as he was of the opinion that development of such pipelines can revive the economy.Hurdles RemainDespite Trump administration's clearance, the pipeline has been facing regulatory obstacles, and opposition from landowners, environmentalists and Native American tribes.Some environmental groups in Montana filed a lawsuit in March 2017 who claim that President Trump violated federal environmental law by approving the Keystone XL construction permit without updating the project's 5-year-old environmental impact report.Further, after TransCanada had spent months negotiating with shippers, 60% uptake — though providing some encouragement to the company — seems relatively modest as compared to Kinder Morgan's (KMI  -  Free Report) Trans Mountain Expansion Pipeline which secured shipments for 80% of its total capacity. Notably, the company cleared a major regulatory hurdle in November 2017 when Nebraska commissioners approved the project, but on an alternative route instead of the company’s proposed route. This has only created new set of problems for the company.The alternate route will likely balloon costs and delay the disputed pipeline project further.The alternate route calls for a 63-mile detour and attempts to add 5 miles of pipeline along with additional transmission lines and pumping stations. Hence the company is currently busy in reevaluating the project’s viability and schedule.It also engaged in negotiations around easements with landlords along the new route.Additionally, the Keystone project has been booked several times for causing oil spill. Federal investigators believe that constructional fault is the most likely reason for the oil spill. This has raised concerns among South Dakota regulators regarding the future operations and potential risks associated with the extension of the pipeline.While the states’ objections may cause modest delays, the risk over commercial demand and commercial viability of the project will likely be the primary factors influencing the final investment decision on the project.Despite the uncertainty and criticism that surrounds TransCanada’s major pipeline project, the company reaffirmed the forecasts of its profits and earnings growth on the Investor Day observed on Nov 28.The North American pipeline operator expects EBITDA to grow at an average annual rate of about 10% between 2015 and 2020. Further the Calgary-based company has raised the upper end of its dividend forecasts from 8% to 10%, and extended that outlook by an additional year through 2021.Zacks Rank and Key PicksTransCanada currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).TransCanada Corporation Price TransCanada Corporation Price | TransCanada Corporation QuoteFew better-ranked players in the energy space are ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report) and Royal Dutch Shell plc (RDS.A  -  Free Report).

1553,COP,"National Oilwell Varco, Inc. (NOV  -  Free Report) recently restructured its business segments by combining two of its offshore-levered segments into a single unit. The company combined Rig Systems and Rig Aftermarkets into a single unit named Rig Technologies during fourth-quarter 2017. The strategic move is likely to enable National Oilwell to reduce the administration burden and better align the company with the evolving market conditions.While Rig Systems was engaged in the design and manufacturing of integrated drilling systems and components for land and offshore drilling rigs, Rig Aftermarket was involved in the delivery of consumables, spares and other necessary services to maintain the usefulness of the assets. Notably, both these segments witnessed weaker year-over-year income in the last quarter amid lower activities and order cancellations.The company which is expected to release fourth-quarter 2017 numbers on Feb 5, forecasts its offshore dependent unit Rig Technologies to deliver better-than-expected results in the quarter. However, management remains concerned about its Completion and Production Solutions arm whose results are expected to be below the prior guidance.Deferred deliveries of a new product in its Subsea Flexible Pipe business along with engineering challenges and scarcity of orders in its Process and Flow Technologies unit is likely to hurt the results of the segment. Meanwhile, National Oilwell expects results from its onshore focused Wellbore Technologies to be in line with expectations.Further, the company also anticipates to incur $120-$140 million pre-tax restructuring charges. This would include expenses for facility closures, severance and inventory write-downs, as well as other charges in the quarter under review.National Oilwell carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).National Oilwell Varco, Inc.

1554,COP,"Buckeye Partners, L.P. (BPL  -  Free Report) announced the pricing of junior subordinated notes worth $400 million. The notes priced at 99.474% of par, will bear interest at a fixed rate of 6.375% per annum, and fall due on 2078 for redemption.Buckeye Partners expects to close the offering on Jan 22, 2018, subject to customary closing conditions. The partnership expects to receive net proceeds worth $394.9 million after deducting the underwriting discount and other offering expenses.In November 2017, Buckeye Partners had priced senior unsecured notes worth $400 million aggregate principal amount of 4.125% and due 2027 at 99.503% of par. The partnership received $394.4 million and used the net proceeds from this offering to fund the redemption of $300 million aggregate principal amount of its outstanding 6.050% notes due Jan 15, 2018 and repaid some part of its borrowings under revolving credit facility.The partnership intends to utilize the net proceeds of the offering of 4.125% senior notes and the 6.375% subordinated notes, to pay off loans under its revolving credit facility along with repaying other debt-borrowings, and for general partnership purposes.Partnership’s Rising Debts — Cause of ConcernThe partnership has been reeling under the pressure of rising interest and debt expenses for quite some time now. Buckeye Partners frequently acquires assets to focus on core business. The partnership pursues both organic and acquisition-driven growth strategies to expand scale of operations. As such, such large capital extensive projects require the company to borrow frequently and subsequently increase the burden of capital expenditures.Toward this, the partnership’s long-term debt as of Sep 30, 2017 was $4,593.6 million, higher than $4,217.7 million as of Dec 31, 2016. Additionally, interest and debt expenses also increased 17.2% to $168.9 million, during the same period.This is likely to be the primary cause behind the partnership’s underperformance in price movement over the last year. The partnership has lost 8.8%, wider than the 5.2% decline of the industry.As a result, Buckeye Partners currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Better-ranked players from the sector are ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report), Denbury Resources Inc.

1555,COP,"Production has been rampant in offshore and onshore fields in Norway since 1971. Since the start of production, a total of 107 fields on the Norwegian have yielded oil and gas. The number of fields in production totaled 85 at the end of 2017. Out of this, 66 were located in the North Sea, 17 in the Norwegian Sea and two in the Barents Sea. In 2017, five new fields were brought online, in which 36 exploration wells were drilled on the NCS. 11 new discoveries were made and another nine were still under development at the end of the year. The discoveries are expected to boost resource potential by about 33 million standard cubic meters of oil equivalents.Of the producing fields, many are mature, while some of them still have considerable reserves. There are other fields with comparatively small reserves. Further, the resource base in these fields gets enhanced when small discoveries in the area are tied in to existing infrastructure.Undiscovered Resources at NCSPer the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate (NPD), the undiscovered resources on the NCS are estimated at about four billion standard cubic metres (Sm3) of recoverable oil equivalents or about 54% of all the remaining resources on the shelf. Of the undiscovered resources, 18% is in the North Sea, 19% in the Norwegian Sea and 63% in the Barents Sea.There are two types of exploration wells — wildcat and appraisal wells. Wildcat wells are drilled to find out if there are hydrocarbon deposits under the seabed. While appraisal wells are often drilled after a discovery has been made to acquire additional data relating to the extent and size. Of the 36 exploration wells drilled in 2017, 24 were wildcat wells and 12 were appraisal wells.Problems Faced in Increasing YieldDue to the volatility in the oil prices, most explorers have cut their spending budget. It is unlikely that the explorers will increase their spending unless oil prices are sustained at levels above $60 per barrel. Due to the reduced spending since 2015, there has been low level of activities resulting in lack of big discoveries. This has led to apprehension of lack in supply in Western Europe.According to NPD, the number of wells drilled offshore Norway declined 3% compared to 2016 and it expects this number to remain at the same level for 2018. In 2017, 17 of the wells were drilled in the Barents Sea, 12 in the North Sea and 5 in the Norwegian Sea. In 2016, 5 wells were drilled in the Barents Sea, 29 in the North Sea and 3 in the Norwegian Sea.Per the plans submitted by the companies for drilling in 2017, most exploration wells will be drilled in the North Sea. Currently, Norway needs more and larger oil discoveries.However, cost-cutting efforts and large oil discoveries made prior to the oil price crash are likely to help sustain oil and gas production on the NCS over the next five years.Exploration Results in 2017 Not Very SatisfyingIn 2017, the exploration well — Korpfjell — drilled in the Norwegian section of a formerly disputed area between Norway and Russia, showed immense potential. This northernmost wildcat well is expected to contain more than 250 million barrels of oil equivalent (boe), which failed to meet expectations.In the 24th licensing round Norway offered 93 blocks in the Barents Sea and 9 blocks in the Norwegian Sea. But due to disappointing Barents Sea campaign in 2017 only 11 companies applied for production licenses including Statoil ASA , BP plc (BP  -  Free Report), Royal Dutch Shell plc (RDS.A  -  Free Report) and ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report). Statoil, Shell and ConocoPhillips sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), while BP carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Production EstimateIn 2017, Norway’s total oil and gas production increased for the fourth straight year, mainly due to higher gas production. Meanwhile, oil production declined to 1.59 million barrels per day (bpd), down 2%, from 1.61 million bpd in 2016. This was due to an unplanned maintenance shutdown at the Goliat oil field.In 2018, oil production is estimated to drop by another 2% to 1.55 million bpd, and the decline is expected to continue until 2020. The giant Johan Sverdrup is expected to start production in late 2019 that is likely to help Norway to boost its oil production until 2023.ConclusionThe total oil and gas production increase will continue till 2023 and is likely to reach 2004 levels. Although oil accounted for most of the production in 2004, gas will constitute about half of the production.While Norway’s oil production is expected to increase over the next five years, the industry will face another decline after 2023.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

1556,COP,"ExxonMobil (XOM  -  Free Report) recently announced an accord with Ghana government for exploring offshore crude resources in the Deepwater Cape Three Points block.Officials of Ghana told Reuters that owing to the characteristic of the oil block, spreading across 366,000 acres, the government did not arrange for the bidding process. For the exploration activities, ExxonMobil — the largest publicly traded oil payer — directly negotiated with the government.  ExxonMobil expects exploration work on the block, awaiting consent from the parliament, to start later this year. The upstream operations will comprise seismic data gathering along with detailed analysis.In the upstream project, ExxonMobil will likely be the operator with 80% ownership. Ghana National Petroleum Corporation, the national oil company of Ghana, is expected to have a 15% interest. ExxonMobil along with the government plans to find a potential energy player in Ghana for the remaining 5%.Management added that the recent agreement shows ExxonMobil’s strong focus on resources that that might hold significant oil and gas reserves.Irving, TX-based ExxonMobil has a leading position in the energy industry owing to the size and diversity of its asset base, both in terms of business mix and geographical footprint.  With a stable cash position, the company’s balance sheet is one of the best in the industry.However, the company’s pricing chart is not impressive.

1557,COP,"Moving forward with its $30-billion divestment goal, Royal Dutch Shell plc (RDS.A  -  Free Report) is set to offload West Qurna 1 oil field in Iraq to Japan's Itochu Corporation. However, the value of the transaction has been kept under wraps. The company also intends to close the divestment of its interest in the Majnoon oil field in Iraq to the state-run Basra Oil Company by June 2018. Production in the Majnoon oil field started in 2014, with average capacity of 210,000 barrels per day.It is to be noted, Shell has a 45% operating stake in the Majnoon oil field. Malaysian national petroleum company, Petronas and Iraq’s Missan Oil Company have 30% and 25% stakes in the field, respectively.The primary reason behind Shell leaving Majnoon is that the oil department of the country and the company could not agree on the future production plans and investments for the field.The divestment is in line with Shell's strategy to steer clear of debt stemming from its $50-billion acquisition of BG Group. The move will also help the company to upgrade and streamline its portfolio.Notably, the company has already vended more than $23-billion assets as part of $30-billion 2016-2018 divestment plan. Additionally, Shell intends to divest more than $10 billion worth of assets in the 2019-2020 time period. We remind investors that as of Sep 30, 2017, Shell had around $80-billion long-term debt.  Its debt-to-capital ratio was 25.4%, which the company intends to reduce to 20% with the help of its divestment programs and operational efficiency.Headquartered in Netherlands, Shell is one of the largest integrated energy companies engaged in production, refining, distribution and marketing of oil and natural gas.

1559,COP,"On Jan 9, Denbury Resources Inc. (DNR  -  Free Report) was raised to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).  Why the Upgrade?Earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks investment philosophy. Stocks that have recently seen an upward revision in estimates tend to outperform the market over the next nine to 12 months.Over the last 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 earnings has been revised higher from 5 cents to 9 cents. Moreover, for 2018, estimates were raised from 12 cents to 26 cents.Denbury has an impressive earnings surprise history. The upstream player managed to surpass the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the prior four quarters, the average positive surprise being 125%. Also, we expect the company to witness year-over-year earnings improvement of 125% in 2017 and 189.8% in 2018.  The business scenario looks profitable as West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil recently traded at $64.77 per barrel — last touched before Dec 8, 2014 — per CNBC. Also, natural gas crossed the psychological mark of $3 per million British Thermal Unit (BTU). Overall, the favorable commodity pricing scenario could fetch the exploration and production company attractive cashflow.We also appreciate the company’s constant efforts to reduce operating expenses amid the volatile business scenario. In the nine-month ended Sep 30, 2017, Denbury’s total expenses declined almost 54%. The company’s pricing chart looks impressive.

1560,COP,"Oil major ExxonMobil Corporation (XOM  -  Free Report) recently made its first move against the lawsuits filed against it by California local governments.  San Francisco, Oakland, San Mateo County and four other local governments in California had alleged last year that the activities of ExxonMobil and other oil companies led to climate change and posed threats to their regions.Local Governments’ ViewsAlong with other casualties the Oakland government believes the sea level will rise 66 inches by 2100 due to climate change. The San Mateo County fears there is 93% chance that it will face a devastating flood in the next 30 years due to the same reason. The San Francisco government blamed climate change for the floods in its low-lying areas.ExxonMobil’s ViewPer the company, the officials had engaged in power abuse by using government investigation and legal action to put pressure on oil producers. ExxonMobil's court filing in Tarrant County, TX includes seeking permission for questioning and gathering reports from the government officials who sued the company for billions.ExxonMobil, which has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), further argued that the city governments in question said in the municipal bond offerings that the risks regarding climate changes are unpredictable, which contradicts their allegation. This gave the oil giant the scope to accuse the municipalities of committing fraud.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The other oil companies sued by the governments include Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (APC  -  Free Report), BP plc.

1561,COP,"On Jan 10, ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report) was raised to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Why the Upgrade?Earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks investment philosophy. Stocks that have recently seen upward revision in estimates tend to outperform the market over the next nine to 12 months.Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 earnings has been revised higher from 54 cents to 57 cents. Also, for 2018, estimates were raised from $1.68 to $1.95.ConocoPhillips — one of the largest exploration and production players in the world based on proved reserves and production — has an impressive earnings surprise history. The upstream player managed to surpass the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the prior four quarters, the average positive surprise being 152.3%. Also, we expect the company to witness year-over-year earnings improvement of 121.4% in 2017 and 243.4% in 2018. The business scenario looks profitable as West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil recently traded at $63.67 per barrel — last touched before Dec 9, 2014 — per Reuters. Also, natural gas is hovering around the psychological mark of $3 per million British Thermal Unit (BTU). Overall, the favorable commodity pricing scenario could fetch the exploration and production company attractive cashflow.We also appreciate the company’s initiative to divest non-core assets as the explorer could use the proceeds in the lucrative Eagle Ford shale and Permian Basin. The proceeds will also help the upstream company lower debt that has accumulated owing to the persistent slump in oil over more than three years. The positive developments are reflected in ConocoPhillips’ impressive pricing chart. Over the past year, the stock has gained 13.1%, outperforming the industry’s12.5% decline. Other Stocks to ConsiderA few other prospective stocks in the energy sector are Chevron Corporation (CVX  -  Free Report), Denbury Resources Inc. (DNR  -  Free Report) and Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation (COG  -  Free Report). All the stocks sport a Zacks Rank #1.

1563,COP,"In a bid to delever balance sheet and slash costs, Cenovus Energy Inc. (CVE  -  Free Report) recently unveiled a leaner capex budget for 2018. The capital discipline is targeted to support the acquisition of oil sands assets worth C$16.8 billion from ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report) earlier this year. In 2018, Cenovus intends to remain focused on reducing huge debt burden, strengthening balance sheet and optimizing asset portfolio.The company announced a $1.5-$1.7 billion capital program for 2018 with majority of capital allocated toward oil sands operation. Cenovus Energy expects to invest between $1.04 billion and $1.16 billion in the Deep Basin in 2018. Oil sands operating cost and sustaining capital costs have been reduced by 8% and 12%, respectively, compared with the prior guidance. Further, it has allocated $270 million for the construction of the phase G expansion at Christina Lake given the lower costs of operations. The go-forward capital efficiencies for the company’s Christina Lake operations have improved by 21%, compared with the previously provided range.Owing to spending on the Deep Basin acquisition, Cenovus Energy has increased leverage metrics significantly. Given the current gas market and stretched balance sheet, the company has reduced Deep Basin spending plans in 2018. It expects to invest between $175 million and $195 million in the Deep Basin in 2018.The company plans to decrease workforce by 15%, laying off around 500-700 employees.  As a part of the cost containment efforts adopted during the industry downturn, Cenovus Energy has already retrenched around 1,500 and 400 jobs in 2015 and 2016, respectively.Several executive-level management changes were announced with the budget. The company’s CFO Ivor Ruste will retire on Apr 30, 2018. Notably, Kieron McFadyen —executive vice president and president of upstream operations — will step down from his position on Jan 15, 2018 and Drew Zieglgansberger will take over McFadyen’s responsibilities. Further, Keith Chiasson will become president of the downstream operations, replacing Bob Pease who will step down on Jan 15, 2018.Spun off from Encana Corporation (ECA  -  Free Report) in 2009, Cenovus is an integrated oil company headquartered in Alberta, Canada. The company is focused on growing oil projects along with establishing natural gas and crude oil production in Alberta and Saskatchewan. Cenovus Energy continues to work on advancing technologies to reduce the amount of water, steam, natural gas and electricity used in operations as well as decrease surface land disturbance. The company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 125% in the third quarter of 2017.While the disciplined budget and measures to rein in the cost structure bode well amid stretched financials of the company, the weak share price movement of the company is a concern. Cenovus Energy has lost 43.7% year to date, wider than 12.9% decline of its industry.Cenovus Energy carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked player in the energy space is Northern Oil and Gas, Inc. (NOG  -  Free Report) which sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

1566,COP,"The resource-rich Arctic offshore has long been viewed as the hot spot for hydrocarbon development. Nevertheless, weak oil prices during the slump period along with technical challenges associated with Arctic exploration and increasing shift toward low-carbon economy amid climate change issue have curbed interests in the Arctic offshore drilling. However, the recovering commodity price environment along with President Trump’s pro-energy policies is likely to spark renewed interests in the exploration and development of the region.In fact, Trump signed an executive order in April aimed at reviving the drilling activities in the Arctic, as part of his promise to unleash an energy revolution. Early this month, the U.S. Senate passed a bill permitting oil and gas exploration in Alaska’s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (“ANWR”) which had been off limits for decades.The legislation, which has been rolled in with a larger tax reform bill, might be lauded by the industry advocates but has been criticized by the environmental groups who are concerned about its catastrophic effects on the indigenous communities.Potential Riches and Problems in Arctic DrillingWith the increasing demand for oil and gas, the Arctic and its seas are of crucial importance.Estimated to hold vast untapped oil and gas reserves, Arctic exploration can bolster the economy of United States by creating jobs and supplying cheap oil. Per the U.S. Geological Survey, ANWR has around 4.3-11.8 billion barrels of recoverable oil.Certain reports forecast that exploration in ANWR could create over 130,000 jobs, consequently generating around $440 billion revenues over the life of the drilling. Drilling in ANWR would help the nation tap into domestic resources and reduce the oil imports from Russia, Venezuela and other Middle Eastern countries. This would pave the way for a more energy independent and secure nation.However, the environmental challenges associated with offshore Arctic drilling remains a key concern for the green campaigners. The opponents claim the projected revenues are quite overestimated as it fails to account for market conditions as well as excessive production and operating costs. The criticizers believe that the drilling will only endanger coastal communities and wildlife, aggravating the climate issue further. Opponents claim that offshore Arctic drilling can reinforce reliance on environmentally harmful energy sources.Access to areas both on land in ANWR and the Arctic Ocean (the Chukchi and Beaufort seas) can cause irreparable damage to the environment. Industrial drilling activities in Chukchi and Beaufort seas could harm the native animals including polar bears, seals and whales among others. Drilling oil in some areas of the Arctic could cause toxins to be released into the ocean. Further, oil spills, which are part of drilling activities, can devastate the Arctic ecosystem. Environmentalists argue that oil companies have not demonstrated the capability to clean up an oil spill.Oil exploration and drilling in ANWR would carve up industrial infrastructure in the area, endangering the pristine habitat, consequently exposing the flora and fauna of the region to toxins and oil spills.Abandoned EndeavorsIn 2015, Royal Dutch Shell plc (RDS.A  -  Free Report) announced its decision to quit the $7 billion Arctic drilling program due to the Arctic region’s huge operating expenses and excessive regulatory hurdles for environmental issues. Notably, the project was deemed unfeasible amid weak oil prices. By quitting the project, Shell joined the likes of other supermajors including BP plc (BP  -  Free Report), Chevron Corp. (CVX  -  Free Report) and ExxonMobil Corp. (XOM  -  Free Report) which have also abandoned the Arctic program.Last year, various oil companies including Eni S.p.A. (E  -  Free Report), ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report), Statoil ASA , TOTAL S.A. and Iona Energy Inc among others had also discontinued their drilling rights in the U.S. Arctic waters. The pullout was part of the cost-cut initiatives adopted by the energy companies during the slump period. Arctic exploration entails excessive costs and environmental risks which the companies did not find rewarding. Consequently, having struggled to capitalize on the huge deposits of oil and gas buried below the icy waters, oil companies relinquished over 2.2 million acres of drilling rights in the Chukchi and Beaufort seas.Is Arctic Exploration Bound for a Comeback?Following a two-year hiatus, Arctic offshore drilling seems poised for revival on the back of Trump’s pro-energy policies and improving energy landscape.Late last month, Eni received permit to drill in Beaufort Sea north of Alaska after a thorough review of the company’s well designs and safety protocol. This was the first time United States had issued a permit to drill in its Arctic waters since Shell’s unsuccessful attempt in 2015. Eni plans to drill two exploration wells and two potential sidetrack wells in the next two years.Recently, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company announced its intention to restart production at the Goliat oil field located in the Barents Sea. Along with Eni’s Goliat project, Statoil’s Snohvit project is also operating in the region. Several other middling discoveries have been made in the region and some are waiting for development and necessary approvals. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Earlier this month, Statoil also gave the go-ahead to the $6 billion Arctic project after reducing costs to half. Previously the project was not considered economically feasible with capex of 100 billion Norwegian kroner and a break-even oil price of $80 a barrel. However, after having successfully adapted itself to operate amid low oil prices, the company has managed to reduce the investments to 49 billion Norwegian kroner and a break-even oil price of $35 a barrel.With this, the Johan Catsberg project — holding around 450-650 million barrels of oil equivalent — has become the biggest offshore project to be approved this year. Being the operator of the project, Statoil owns 50% interest, while Eni and Petoro hold 30% and 20%, respectively. Production from the Catsberg project located in the Barents Sea is anticipated to commence in 2022.Next year, Statoil intends to drill 25-30 wells in Norwegian waters, out of which five to six are expected in the Barents Sea.  More than half of Norway’s undiscovered oil and gas is expected in Barents Sea which will help address the country’s dwindling oil production.Recently, the U.S. Senate passed a tax reform package authorizing oil drilling in Alaska's ANWR, which will help in generating at least $1 billion in lease sale revenues in the next 10 years. Though the prospects seem promising, the overall long-term consequences of the Arctic offshore drilling remains a wait and watch story.Investor Alert: Breakthroughs PendingA medical advance is now at the flashpoint between theory and realization. Billions of dollars in research have poured into it. Companies are already generating substantial revenue, and even more wondrous products are in the pipeline.Cures for a variety of deadly diseases are in sight, and so are big potential profits for early investors.

1567,COP,"Crude mostly traded above the $100-per barrel mark before August 2014, arguably the most glorious days for energy explorers. This helped the upstream players rake in significant cash and reward investors handsomely. The healthy pricing scenario convinced U.S. shale players to ramp up production by utilizing new methods such as horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing (or fracking).While major oil producers started ramping up crude production, the energy space changed from an oil deficit one to an oversupplied market which resulted in low oil prices. Even as oil is currently trading above the $55-a-barrel mark, the commodity price is way lower than the mid-2014 level.Along with OPEC’s production cut extension agreement, the tax reform bill will provide a breather to energy players.Senate & House Agree on 21% Corporate TaxThe Republicans in the Senate and House have decided to put the corporate tax rate at 21% instead of 20%, per the accord signed on Dec 13. Even after the slight bump up, the rate is way lower than the current 35%. Meanwhile, President Trump applauded the move and is content with the 21%.How Will the Energy Sector Benefit?The Energy sector has long been a major tax payer with a median tax rate of 36.8% for the last 11 years, as per the corporate tax calculator of MarketWatch. Over the same time frame, the average tax rate for the S&P 500 universe has been estimated at 30% by MarketWatch. Hence, energy companies in general have been losing money more than the majority of S&P 500 companies in the form of taxes.  To date, energy firms like Marathon Oil Corporation (MRO  -  Free Report), ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report), Hess Corporation (HES  -  Free Report), Apache Corporation (APA  -  Free Report) and Chevron Corporation (CVX  -  Free Report) have paid high median effective annual tax rates of 49.9%, 46.9%, 45.5%, 42.6%, and 42.4%, respectively, per MarketWatch.Marathon Oil, Hess, Apache and Chevron carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), while ConocoPhillips carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.With a 21% tax rate, oil and gas companies will definitely save a lot of money, which could be directed toward growth and maintenance projects.More DetailsEnergy companies invest significantly as the industry is capital-intensive in nature. For example, the world’s largest publicly traded oil company, ExxonMobil Corp. (XOM  -  Free Report), has announced a $22-billion capital plan this year, while Chevron has set its capital spending budget for 2017 at around $20 billion.In the current scenario, capital expenditures cannot be tax-deducted in the year they are incurred. Consequently, U.S. companies need to plan their capital expenditure judiciously. However, companies will be able to deduct their capital expenditures from taxable income immediately, as per the provisions of the tax reform bill. Naturally, this aspect of the bill hugely favors the oil industry.In the event of companies being able to deduct capital expenses in the year of their occurrence, their tax bills for the year would be lowered significantly due to higher deductions. This will leave more cash in the hands of these companies which can be used to make capital expenditures, acquisitions and share repurchases, among others.Investor Alert: Breakthroughs PendingA medical advance is now at the flashpoint between theory and realization.

1568,COP,"Brazilian state-run Petróleo Brasileiro S.A. or Petrobras (PBR  -  Free Report) recently announced that its fuel distribution unit Petrobras Distribuidora S.A. has managed to raise $1.5 billion (R$5.02 billion) in an initial public offering (""IPO"") even though it priced the shares at R$15, the lower end of its suggested price range.The company increased the size of the offering to make the most of it. The listing was Brazil’s largest since July when the local unit of supermarket chain Carrefour SA (CRRFY) received R$5.12 billion. The IPO has been a topic of discussion between Petrobras and the financial institutions for two years.The success of the IPO signifies that the company has emerged from the threat to its credit rating caused by the multibillion-dollar money laundering and bribery case.In another development, the company also disclosed its intention to exercise its right of first refusal over three of the overall blocks, which will be auctioned in June 2018. Petrobras can opt for at least 30% stake in each pre-salt blocks offshore Brazil. The company is eyeing the Dois Irmãos, Três Marias and Uirapuru blocks. The move is expected to strengthen the exploration portfolio of Petrobras.About the CompanyHeadquartered in Rio de Janeiro, Petrobras is the largest integrated energy firm in Brazil and one of the largest in Latin America. The company’s activities include: exploration, exploitation and production of oil from reservoir wells, shale and other rocks, as well as refining, processing, trading and transportation of oil and oil products, natural gas and other fluid hydrocarbons, in addition to other energy-related activities. The company operates in six segments: Exploration and Production (E&P), Refining, Transportation and Marketing, Distribution, Gas and Power, Biofuels and International.Considering Brazil's huge pre-salt oil reserves – estimated at 9.5 to 14 billion barrels of oil equivalent and widely thought to be the most important oil find in recent years – we believe Petrobras is in an enviable position to maintain an impressive production growth profile for years to come.However, the company has massive debt loads as it carries a net debt of more than $88 billion, with net debt-to-capitalization ratio of approximately 51%. As such, leverage remains a key area of concern for the firm.In addition, Petrobras has lost 6.2% of its value year to date against 5.6% growth of its industry.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderPetrobras has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the oil and energy sector are Northern Oil and Gas, Inc.

1572,COP,"Brazil's state-run energy giant Petroleo Brasileiro S.A., or Petrobras (PBR  -  Free Report) saw its shares crash more than 7% after it announced third-quarter earnings per ADR of 3 cents, way short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 15 cents and a lot lower than the year-ago earnings of 12 cents.Judicial contingency provisions, payments on account of a tax agreement with Brazil’s government, weak domestic demand and lower margins at its downstream unit primarily impacted Petrobras’ bottom line. These factors were partly offset by higher crude price.On a somewhat positive note, Petrobras generated free cash flows of $4,657 million for the quarter ended Sep 30 -- positive for the 10th quarter in a row -- reflecting operational improvement and lower investments. However, adjusted EBITDA was down 11.4% year over year to $6,075 million.For the first nine months of the year, exports of oil and oil products rose 39%, while imports fell 19%. This helped the company maintain the position of net exporter with a positive balance of 385 thousand barrels per day.Petroleo Brasileiro S.A.- Petrobras Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Petroleo Brasileiro S.A.- Petrobras Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Petroleo Brasileiro S.A.- Petrobras QuoteModifies Asset Sales, Cash TargetsPetrobras lowered the goal for asset divestitures for this year to $7 billion from $8 billion previously, a sign that Brazil's flagship oil company has been hamstrung by court verdicts, freezing some deals.In a presentation following third-quarter results, Petrobras said cash and equivalents are expected at $21 billion by year-end, up from the previous announcement of $20 billion.Revenue, Production and PricesThe troubled national oil company’s net operating revenues of $22,700 million improved from the year-earlier sales of $21,693 million on higher crude prices but fell shy of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $23,141 million.The Rio de Janeiro-headquartered company’s total oil and gas production during the third quarter reached 2,749 thousand oil-equivalent barrels per day (MBOE/d) – 80% liquids – down from 2,869 MBOE/d in the same period of 2016. The decline could be attributed to tumbling capital expenditure.Compared with the third quarter of 2016, Brazilian oil and natural gas production – constituting 96% of the overall output – decreased 3% to 2,640 MBOE/d.In the July to September period, the average sales price of oil in Brazil jumped 15.6% from the year-earlier period to $48.30 per barrel.Capital Spending & Balance SheetDuring the nine months ended Sep 30, 2017, Petrobras’ capital investments and expenditures totaled $10,528 million, sharply lower than the $11,590 million incurred in the year-ago period. Also, over the past year, the company cut its workforce by 12% through a voluntary separation program.This allowed the world's most indebted oil company to trim its massive debt load. At the end of September 2017, the company had net debt of $88,143 million, reflecting a decrease from $96,381 million as of Dec 31, 2016. Net debt-to-capitalization ratio was approximately 51%, down from 55% nine months ago. Additionally, Petrobras finished the third quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $23,495 million.Zacks Rank & Stock PicksPetrobras currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), implying that it is expected to perform in line with the broader U.S. equity market over the next one to three months.Meanwhile, one can look at better-ranked energy players like ExxonMobil Corporation (XOM  -  Free Report), ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report) and PBF Energy Inc.

1574,COP,"It was a week where the price of oil spiked to its highest settlement since June 2015, while natural gas futures rose to a five-month peak.On the news front, France-based integrated major TOTAL S.A. (TOT  -  Free Report) agreed to buy liquefied natural gas assets from utility company Engie for around $1.5 billion. Meanwhile, downstream operator Andeavor (ANDV  -  Free Report) and Canadian natural gas firm Encana Corp. (ECA  -  Free Report) came up with weaker-than-expected earnings reports.Overall, it was a good week for the sector. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures gained about 2.3% to close at $56.74 per barrel, while natural gas prices jumped 7.7% to $3.213 per million Btu (MMBtu). (See the last ‘Oil & Gas Stock Roundup’ here: Shell, EOG, Concho Report Strong Q3)The U.S. oil benchmark rallied on expectations that OPEC and other major producers will agree to expand their output-cut deal beyond March when they meet at the end of the month. The agreement, already renewed once, keeps 1.8 million barrels a day off the market in an attempt to clear a supply glut.Further support came from the U.S. Energy Department's inventory release, which showed steep declines in domestic gasoline and distillate inventories.Political turmoil in Saudi Arabia, where the kingdom’s 32-year old crown price – Mohammed bin Salman – ordered the arrest of much of the country’s top leadership, was also bullish for oil prices.Meanwhile, natural gas futures logged a big gain following strong power burn consumption from residential/commercial customers. Despite the commodity’s Lower 48 production being at its highest level on record, colder-than-normal weather forecasts over the next two weeks are expected to drive natural gas demand.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    French energy giant TOTAL S.A. announced that it has entered into a definite agreement to acquire the upstream liquefied natural gas (LNG) assets of compatriot gas utility Engie for $1.49 billion. The decision to buy the assets and expand footprint in the LNG business is expected to benefit the company significantly.Per the agreement, TOTAL will have control over Engie’s interest in the Cameron LNG project in the United States, long-term LNG sales and purchase agreements, and an LNG tanker fleet. It will also have access to regasification capacities in Europe. TOTAL might pay another $550 million to Engie, subject to improvement in oil markets in the coming year. This transaction is expected to close by mid-2018.This deal, scheduled to be closed in 2018, will expand TOTAL’s total volume of LNG sales to 40 million tons per year in 2020. So, the decision to acquire Engie’s assets will expand TOTAL’s operation in LNG and increase revenue contribution from this space. (Read more: TOTAL to Acquire LNG Assets From Engie for $1.49B)2.    Independent refiner and marketer Andeavor reported third-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings from continuing operations of $2.70 per share, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.03. A 24% decline in Retail and Branded fuel margins and increased operating expenses resulted in the earnings miss.The bottom line, however, increased from the year-ago quarter figure of $1.43 per share on strong performance of the refining segment. Refining margin increased 66.2% year over year to $15.09 per barrel. Region-wise, refining margin was up almost 44.7% to $13.37 per barrel in California, 109.6% to $15.03 in the Pacific Northwest and about 57.9% to $17.27 in Mid-Continent on a year-over-year basis.Andeavor expects throughput level for the fourth quarter between 1,070 MBbl/d and 1,125 MBbl/d. Region wise, California expects throughput volumes between 520 and 545 MBbl/d. Pacific Northwest and Mid Continent expects throughput levels within 165–175 MBbl/d and 385–405 MBbl/d, respectively. The company expects total capital expenditures to be around $1.3 billion in 2017. Turnaround expenditures for full year 2017 are expected to be $540 million.

Further, the bottom line declined from 4 cents per share reported in the year-ago quarter. Lower production adversely impacted results.Quarterly natural gas production declined approximately 29% year over year to 939 million cubic feet per day, while liquids production rose 9% year over year to 127.5 thousand barrels per day. Total production declined 16% to 284 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (MBOE/d).Revenues of $861 million, however, beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $827 million due to a rise in realized commodity prices. However, revenues were 12.1% lower than the prior-year figure of $979 million.Encana's realized natural gas price was $2.23 per thousand cubic feet, up 10.4% from the year-ago quarter level of $2.02. Meanwhile, liquids price rose marginally to $41.86 per barrel from $41.82 in the third quarter of 2016.

Based on a flat real West Texas Intermediate (WTI) price of $50 per barrel, annual capital expenditure is expected to average $5.5 billion in the next three years.The Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company anticipates cash return on capital employed to be more than 20% by 2020 and sustaining capital of about $3.5 billion.

1575,COP,"ExxonMobil Corporation (XOM  -  Free Report) has been presented with an opportunity by Ghana for carrying out deepwater exploration off the country’s coast.Ghana has initiated talks with the oil giant and negotiations are underway as per current regulations. Per sources, the government had chosen to negotiate directly with ExxonMobil instead of resorting to competitive tendering. Also, regulations relating to open competitive tendering are yet to be passed by the country.Per a new petroleum law, oil contracts should be awarded through open and competitive tender. However, direct negotiation is also allowed if deemed necessary and reasonable.In 2015, ExxonMobil inked a Memorandum of Understanding with Ghana relating to the examination of its Deepwater Cape Three Point (DCTP) region. The region was situated 150 kilometers (100 miles) off the coast in water depth ranging between 2,000 and 4,000 meters (6,500 and 13,000 feet). The DCTP represents the second effort by ExxonMobil to purchase oil assets in Ghana. The company’s first attempt was takeover of Kosmos' stake in the flagship Jubilee field in 2009. This attempt was blocked by the government.Per the government, two firms had separately decided not to explore the field due to its depth and the risk involved. However, ExxonMobil was highly favored by the government because of its expertise and understanding of deepwater operations.Ghana anticipates oil production to reach about 250,000 barrels per day by 2019. The yield is expected from four oil fields including Jubilee, which currently has a combined average annual output of about 100,000 barrels per day. These transactions will add significantly to ExxonMobil’s assets portfolio. Price MovementThe company’s shares have returned 6% compared with the industry’s rally of 11.6% in the last three months. Zacks Rank & Other Key PicksExxonMobil currently carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).A few other top-ranked players in the energy sector include Braskem SA (BAK  -  Free Report), ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report) and Northern Oil and Gas Inc.

1578,COP,"Shares of Occidental Petroleum Corporation (OXY  -  Free Report) have outperformed the Zacks Domestic Integrated Oil and Gas industry in the last six months. While the company’s shares rallied 10.8%, the industry gained 5.9%.Occidental Petroleum continues to benefit from increasing oil production in the Permian Resources and from its focus on high margin production region. Improving operating efficiency is also lowering barrels of oil equivalent (boe) operating expenses of the company in Permian Resources region. Year to date, operating expenses per boe is $8.14, down from $12.93 per boe in 2016, reflecting an improvement of 37%.Capital expenditures in the first nine months of 2017 were $2.4 billion compared with $1.8 billion in the last-year period. Year to date, the company has invested nearly $2 billion in its Oil & Gas segment, which boosted its performance. Occidental Petroleum expects to increase its capital expenditure to $1.1 billion for the fourth quarter, taking its 2017 spending to nearly $3.6 billion.Occidental Petroleum is also gaining from improving contribution from Chemical segment, primarily due to improving pricing and operations. The company will generate additional cash flow from the Chemical segment in 2018, thanks to the startup of the 4CPe plant in the fourth quarter of this year and from improving product prices.The company’s operation is subject to natural calamities and disasters. Occidental Petroleum had to temporarily shut its chlorovinyl production, primarily due to impact of Hurricane Harvey, which lowered its pre-tax income by nearly $60 million in the third quarter.

1579,COP,"It seems the oil supermajors have finally managed to turn the corner after being hit by the industry downturn for three years. Recovering commodity price and successful cost-cut strategies adopted during the slump period helped them deliver stellar results.Rebounding Oil & Cost Cuts Drive Oil MajorsFollowing the supply glut and lackluster global demand, oil prices remained low for more than three years. From 2014, crude oil went from over $100 a barrel to under $30. However, the market has recovered from these historic lows with prices finally rebounding to more than $50 a barrel. Recently, crude prices reached a more than two-year high of above $57. The commodity pricing environment has been improving, courtesy of tightening supplies, rising demand and OPEC-deal extension talks.The direct impact of strengthening crude was visible on the oil majors, which also reaped benefits of cost-containment strategies adopted during the historic downturn period. They focused on realigning their business models to a more leaner and efficient structure so as to stay competitive in the long run. The companies engaged in reducing headcount, streamlining operations, divesting non-core projects, slashing dividends, capex and operating costs to adapt to the weak pricing environment and bolster their financials.With cost reductions combined with the price recovery, major oil firms ExxonMobil Corp. (XOM  -  Free Report), Chevron Corp. (CVX  -  Free Report), BP plc (BP  -  Free Report), Royal Dutch Shell (RDS.A  -  Free Report) and TOTAL S.A. (TOT  -  Free Report) — collectively known as ‘Big Oil’ — successfully came out of the slump. Each of these companies surpassed earnings estimates in third-quarter 2017 along with recording year-over-year improvement in both the top and bottom line.Exxon, Chevron, BP, Shell and TOTAL Report Jump in Profits With commodity prices on their way up, the world’s largest publicly traded oil company, ExxonMobil reported net earnings of $11.3 billion in the first nine months of 2017, up 84% from the year-ago corresponding period income of $6.2 billion. Smaller rival Chevron posted net earnings of around $6.1 in the said time frame as against the net loss of $912 million reported in the corresponding period of 2016.British energy giant BP posted earnings of $3.4 billion as against net loss of $382 million recorded in the corresponding period of 2016, while Anglo-Dutch super major Shell reported earnings of around $11.5 billion — a whopping 113% surge compared with the year-ago period. France’s TOTAL reported net income was $7.7 billion, up 31% from the year-ago period.Strong Cash Flow from OperationsDuring the last nine months, the Big Five oil companies reported a sharp year-over-year increase in cash flow from operating activities, which is a key metric to gauge the financial health of the firms. The companies generated enough cash to pay off debt along with funding capex and dividend payments.BP generated operating cash flow of $13 billion in the first nine months of 2017 as against $8.3 billion reported in the corresponding period of 2016. Chevron reported $14.3 billion in cash flow from operations, up from $9 billion in the year-ago period.TOTAL witnessed a more than 24% year-over-year increase in cash flow from operations, which stood at $15.2 billion in the first nine months of 2017. ExxonMobil generated $24.4 billion in cash flow compared to $16.9 billion recorded in the year-ago period. Shell generated cash flow from operations of $28.4 billion, up 148% from the $11.4 billion recorded in the corresponding period of 2016.The improvement in the underlying pattern of income and cash flow emphasize the strength of the integrated model of the super-majors. Following strong third-quarter results, the Zacks Industry Rank for Oil and Gas - Integrated - International stands at #22 (Top 9%). While Chevron, BP and ExxonMobil carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) each, Shell and TOTAL carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Big Five Business Model Adapting with $50 CrudeThe robust cash flows and the solid Zacks Rank underscore the fact that the super-majors can not only survive but also flourish at $50 a barrel. The remodelling of portfolio and strategies has made these firms way more resilient to reduced crude prices, thus achieving break-even at $50 a barrel or even lower.Break-even price is one of the popular metrics to determine the success of oil companies. It indicates the oil price which a company requires to generate enough cash to meet its dividend and capex requirements.Notably, Shell has reduced its break-even point to $47 a barrel currently, reflecting a 60% decline from the $120 a barrel threshold in 2013. BP recently stated that it has managed to achieve break-even at $47 a barrel as against $60 earlier this year, with further reduction plans in store. The company currently targets to achieve break-even at $35-$40 per barrel by 2021. The remaining super majors have also successfully lowered their break-even price to around $50 a barrel.Dividend Payout Pressure to EaseAs low oil prices over the past three years weighed on the energy companies' top and bottom lines, the industry was forced to chalk out new strategies to shield their dividends and balance sheet. Players that focus more on exploration and production activities including Texas-based ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report), Spain’s Repsol SA (REPYY  -  Free Report), and Italian oil giant Eni S.p.A. resorted to dividend cuts to shore up their financials.Meanwhile, the super-majors held up far better though the likes of BP, TOTAL, Shell, Statoil, etc started offering scrip dividends to shareholders, instead of full-cash dividends. ExxonMobil suspended its share repurchase program amid cataclysmic energy-price scenario. Though it did not resort to dividend cuts, the company’s dividend growth rate has been lacklustre.However, with recovering energy landscape and improving financial picture of the companies, super-majors are likely to abandon their scrip dividend program. After reporting robust third-quarter results, BP announced plans to call off its scrip dividend and resume share buyback programs.On the other hand, TOTAL is set to do away with the discount it gives on the scrip option in 2018 following the strongest quarterly earnings in the last two years, pointing to brighter prospects and improving cash flow generation. Statoil also announced to re-start paying full cash dividends from the next quarter, putting an end to its two-year scrip program. The CFO of Shell also reaffirmed the company’s priority to slash debt and cancel the scrip dividends.ConclusionBig Oil continues to benefit from their scale and diversification that result in the strongest returns on capital in the industry. More importantly, the companies are able to cover their investment and payouts with cash from operations -- something investors really want right now.Most of them remain in excellent financial health, with ample cash on hand and investment-grade credit ratings with a manageable debt-to-capitalization ratio. On top of this, managements have established quite a track record of conservative capital management and cash returns to shareholders. They also pay a safe dividend, yielding attractive returns.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

1580,COP,"Energy-focused engineering and construction company McDermott International, Inc. (MDR  -  Free Report) recently announced that it has received an engineering, procurement, construction and installation (""EPCI"") contract from a customer in the Middle East. The news follows the company's strong third-quarter results, which showed a 72% year-over-year increase in quarterly revenues.McDermott's customer in the Middle East, possibly Saudi Aramco, has provided the contract for a project in the Safaniya oil field in the Arabian Gulf. Although the financial details of the deal are yet to be announced, the project is expected to be worth $750 million to $1.5 billion. It is part of Saudi Aramco’s new $4.5 billion worth energy-related agreements.  McDermott will start working on the project immediately. Per the company, the impact of the project will be reflected in its fourth-quarter 2017 backlog. In this context, we would like to remind investors that as of Sep 30, McDermott had a backlog of $2.4 billion. While 85% of the total backlog is related to offshore operations, the remaining 15% pertains to subsea operations.The company's strong foothold in the Middle East is expected to enable it to execute the project smoothly with its engineering and procurement teams in Dubai, Chennai and Al Khobar, Saudi Arabia. Per the company, its facilities in Saudi Arabia's Dammam and Jebel Ali, located in Dubai will carry out the construction work while its vessels will be charge of installation.About McDermottIncorporated in 1959, Houston, TX-based McDermott is an engineering and construction company, solely focused on the offshore oil and gas business. McDermott primarily serves the worldwide offshore oil and gas field developments, including the front-end design and detailed engineering, fabrication and installation of offshore drilling and production facilities, as well as installation of marine pipelines and subsea production systems. Additionally, the company provides project management and procurement services. It operates in most major offshore oil and gas producing regions under three main reporting segments: Asia Pacific, Americas and the Middle East.We appreciate McDermott’s broad product portfolio, diversified geographical footprint, good market position and strong relationship with national oil companies. However, due to the company’s exclusive focus on the offshore oil and gas business and the uncertain commodity price scenario expected over the next few quarters, investor sentiment toward the company is likely to remain lukewarm.Price PerformanceMcDermott has gained 3.4% year to date against 20.7% fall of its industry.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderMcDermott has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the oil and energy sector include Braskem S.A.

1585,COP,"Integrated energy company Chevron Corporation (CVX  -  Free Report) recently announced that its Canadian unit is progressing with its shale play development in the East Kaybob region located in Duvernay formation of west-central Alberta. It will be the company's first shale play development in Canada.Of the 330,000 acres in the formation, Chevron Canada holds 70% operating stakes, where it plans to start development in about 55,000 acres of the liquid-rich Duvernay. It has been almost eight years since the company registered its presence in Duvernay and is now one the biggest landholders in the basin. Chevron used its experience of operating in the North American shale assets during appraisal drilling for the project. The company has yet to provide the financial details of the project, which is expected to come online during the second half of 2019.Midstream company Pembina Pipeline Corp. (PBA  -  Free Report) is expected to invest C$290 million to create an infrastructure that will be able to ship and process gas and condensate.The Canadian oil industry, which is ruled by the oil sands of northern Alberta, has witnessed around $23 billion worth of divestments this year from several oil companies like Royal Dutch Shell plc (RDS.A  -  Free Report), ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report) and others after oil prices fell during the first half of the year.However, Canadian shale plays – like Duvernay and Montney – continue to remain attractive to players like Chevron as it is much cheaper to drill and complete oil wells in these formations compared to the costly oil sands. Apart from the assets in the Duvernay formation, Chevron has stakes in the Liard and Horn River basins located in Western Canada.About the Company and Zacks RankSan Ramon, CA-based Chevron is one of the largest publicly traded oil and gas companies in the world, based on proved reserves. The company is engaged in oil and gas exploration and production, refining and marketing of petroleum products, manufacturing of chemicals, and other energy-related businesses. Chevron, in its present form, resulted from the 2001 merger between Texaco and Chevron Corporation. Chevron’s operations are divided into two main segments: Upstream and Downstream.In the third quarter, Chevron generated $5.4 billion in operating cash flow, while shelling out around $5.2 billion in capital expenditures and dividends. This led to around $200 million of excess cash flows, something that the company achieved for the first time since 2012. As a result of Chevron's focus on planning and execution, the company continues to reduce its operating costs with underlying expenses down almost 5% year to date compared with 2016. Cash capital expenditures for the first nine months of the year are also down 30%.Chevron targets to grow volume by 4-9% in 2017. This is largely dependent on few big projects. However, sudden and unforeseen damage may reduce the company's planned net increase in output. In particular, Chevron's high-profile Gorgon LNG development in Australia is suffering from mechanical issues that may restrict its ramp-up.Chevron has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1587,COP,"U.S. stock markets are now hitting all-time highs on a daily basis. Stocks have mostly rallied since last year’s election, with a booming U.S. economy, supportive monetary policy and robust corporate earnings being the key triggers. Expectations that the Trump administration’s proposed tax and regulatory reforms will help companies’ and consumers, have given investors further reasons to put their money in stocks. As a matter of fact, the S&P 500 crept further into record territory Tuesday. The index eked out a gain of 0.2%, to an all-time closing high of 2,664.11. What’s Driving the S&P 500 Higher?What's Sending the Index to a String of Records? It’s fairly simple: investors have driven up equities on evidence of economic growth. As per the Commerce Department’s second estimate, the U.S. economy expanded at a 3.3% pace in the third quarter. This represents an improvement from the annualized growth rate of 3.1% in the April to June period and the strongest performance since the third quarter of 2014. Moreover, the latest figure represents the best back-to-back quarters of at least 3% growth since 2014. Further, the November payroll report showed that the domestic labor market continued its recovery from the effects of hurricanes, while jobless rate ticked stayed at a 17-year low of 4.1%. The central bank’s lifting of short-term interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point can also be interpreted as a by-product of rising economic growth and optimism. The expected 'policy normalization' simply indicates that the economy is ready for the ‘quantitative easing’ tap to be turned off. Though higher interest rates raise the cost of debt capital, an expanding economy supersedes low-borrowing costs in the grand scheme of things. Meanwhile, President Trump’s proposals to overhaul the tax law and make it business friendly, added to the positive sentiment and powered stocks higher. Finally, strong earnings reports from corporate biggies, which has helped support high valuations, boosted sentiments. Following two successful quarters of earnings numbers, U.S. companies posted all-time record earnings in the third quarter. Total earnings for S&P 500 companies were up 6.9% from the same period last year on 6% higher revenues. Energy: The Only S&P 500 Laggard While the S&P 500 equity index has been on a tear, it has been a wild ride for the energy market in 2017, setting pulses racing of even the steadiest investors. In fact, energy is the only sector to give negative returns to investors this year. A strong third quarter notwithstanding, energy – which was the best S&P sector performer in 2016, with a market-thumping 24% return – has not exactly had a great year. The Zacks Oil-Energy sector is down more than 1% year-to-date versus 21.9% growth for the broader S&P 500.  With U.S. drillers ramping up their output quickly in response to the extension of OPEC-led supply cuts until the end of 2018 and rising rig count pointing to further jump in American production, the tightening of global oil market is getting undermined and prices are under constant pressure. The steady trend of rising domestic oil production continues to be the biggest headwind for the market. As per the U.S. Energy Department's latest inventory release, U.S. output rose by 73,000 barrels per day (for the week ending Dec 8) to 9.8 million barrels per day – the most since the EIA started maintaining weekly data in 1983. Market participants argue that fundamentals point to a looming oil supply growth despite WTI crude currently staying above the $55 per barrel mark. A Handful of Companies Defied the Downturn Even amid the volatile, declining market, some companies have stood firm, indicating investors’ confidence in them. If bought now, these stocks are likely to outperform others and create long-term wealth. However, selecting stocks to buy could be a tricky proposition, especially with oil prices moving like a roller-coaster. One should focus on picking up stocks that have a sound business, good management and is not pricey. Amid the uncertainty, it is necessary that investors adopt a cautious approach. It is prudent to opt for large cap stocks. These have a market capitalization of over $5 billion, and also have further room for upside. These companies enjoy leading market positions, have a global footprint, strong cash positions and are large enough to stay strong even in the face of unfavorable events. While it is impossible to be sure about such outperformers, this is where the Zacks Rank, which justifies a company’s strong fundamentals, can come in really handy. In particular, we have shortlisted 5 companies that have outperformed oil prices over the year, and have a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. Our Choices BP plc (BP  -  Free Report), a #1 Ranked stock, is our first pick.

1588,COP,"It has been a wild ride for the energy market in 2017, setting pulses racing for even the steadiest of investors. Just a few months ago, or until September, the commodity had a very difficult year. In June, U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) fell to nearly $42 a barrel -- the lowest in ten months. Since then, the contract has risen about 37%. In fact, WTI hit a more than two-year high of around $59 recently. Unlike other short-lived rallies over the past three years, we believe the current higher oil prices are a result of improving fundamentals. Declining inventories and the extension of OPEC-led supply cuts until the end of 2018 are the two major factors helping to balance the market and support the strong uptrend. Production Cut Deal ExtensionOne of the significant reasons why the U.S. oil benchmark soared revolved around expectations that OPEC and other major producers will agree to expand their output-cut deal beyond March. True to predictions, the coalition prolonged the current dynamic for another nine months to the end of 2018. The agreement, now renewed twice, keeps 1.8 million barrels a day (or 2% of global supply) off the market in an attempt to clear a supply glut. While there are several question marks over the degree to which the cartel members are adhering to their quotas, there's no ignoring the fact that the cuts continue to narrow the market imbalances. Sharp Inventory DrawdownsInvestors have pinned hopes of recovery over the U.S. Energy Department's inventory releases that show multiple weeks of strong inventory draws in the domestic crude stockpiles – pointing to a slowdown in shale output. Oil stockpiles have shrunk in 27 of the last 35 weeks and are down more than 85 million barrels since April. The gradual fall has helped the U.S. crude market shift from year-over-year storage surplus to a deficit. At 448.1 million barrels, current crude supplies are 7.8% below the year-ago period though they are in the upper half of the average range during this time of the year. Falling Capital Expenditure Also Comes to the RescueThroughout the downturn, producers worked tirelessly to cut costs down to a bare minimum and look for innovative ways to churn out more oil from rock. And they managed to do just that by improving drilling techniques and extracting favorable terms from the beleaguered service producers. With these efforts, many upstream companies have repositioned themselves to thrive even at lower prices. Moreover, slashing investments (in existing and new wells) have led to numerous project cancellations and production losses -- another step in reducing the glut of crude. Concerns Remain Despite OptimismCurrently at around $57 a barrel, the price of oil has more than doubled from the multi-year lows of early last year and it’s a whole new ballgame for investors who are now the most optimistic on the commodity than at any time in the past three years. They believe that the OPEC and Russian agreement will help whittle down huge global stockpiles and lead to even higher prices in the near-term. But with U.S. drillers ramping up their output quickly in response to the OPEC-driven rally and rising rig count pointing to further rise in American production, the tightening of global oil market might get undermined and prices could again come under pressure. The steady trend of rising domestic oil production continues to be the biggest headwind for the market. As per the U.S. Energy Department's latest inventory release, U.S. output rose by 25,000 barrels per day (for the week ending Dec 1) to 9.7 million barrels per day – the most since the EIA started maintaining weekly data in 1983. Earnings PowerIn the midst of such uncertainty, earnings performance has emerged as a decisive factor behind a stock’s performance. Speculations regarding earnings beat or miss have become a fundamental concern for investors that can either cheer or upset to the point of a hasty sell-off. Considered Wall Street’s dirty little secret, the formidable importance of earnings surprises can just not be ignored, whether you like it or not. But from a broader perspective, it is the analysts’ consensus about the inherent strength of companies, coupled with their earnings performance, which should be closely followed for gaining better understanding about how to boost one’s portfolio. Specifically, a history of positive earnings surprise generally works as a catalyst in sending a stock higher. It indicates the company’s ability to surpass the estimates. So, investors take it in their consideration while betting on the stock with the expectation that the company will do the same trick to outpace the estimates in the upcoming release. 4 Stocks that Posted Huge Surprises We have zeroed-in on four stocks that flaunt a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), and have recorded EPS (earnings per share) surprise of over 20% in the last four quarters.

1591,COP,"Per Reuters, PetroChina Company Limited (PTR  -  Free Report), a subsidiary of state-owned China National Petroleum Corporation (“CNPC”), recently conducted an internal transfer of mining rights within its affiliates. It will enable the units that have mature fields to search for oil and gas in underdeveloped areas.PetroChina has transferred 16 blocks for exploration and production, which incorporates blocks from Ordos, Sichuan and Qaidam basins. These blocks are mainly located in the central and western parts of China. The units of PetroChina, which received the blocks and currently operate in matured fields, are mainly located in Daqing, Huabei, Liaohe and Yumen. These affiliates mainly operate in the eastern part of the country.A third of PetroChina's current crude oil volumes come from the Daqing Oil region, the largest crude oil producing region in China. However, it has matured over the years and is well past its prime. As the degree of difficulty in extracting crude oil from the mature Daqing field increases over time, costs will escalate. In fact, the company has warned that volumes could fall by 4.5% this year.The move by PetroChina is thus expected to reduce resource imbalance at the company's units. The step also follows the government of China's broader sector reform drive.About PetroChina PetroChina is the largest integrated oil company in China. It was established in Nov 1999 as part of the restructuring of CNPC, a state-owned entity, which currently holds 86.35% stake in PetroChina.  The company has four segments: Exploration & Production, Natural Gas & Pipelines, Refining & Chemicals, and Marketing.PetroChina is expected to benefit from its robust portfolio of assets and leverage to the fast-growing Chinese economy. The company’s natural gas business will lucrative growth prospects in the coming years as China moves from coal to natural gas. Additionally, the integrated nature of its business is a positive for PetroChina. The company may take advantage of the current situation through its refining and marketing segments as lower prices have prompted higher sales.Zacks Rank and Other Stocks to ConsiderPetroChina has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

1593,COP,"Chevron Corporation (CVX  -  Free Report) offered a glimpse of its 2018 capital spending plans.The company has set its capital and exploratory budget at $18.3 billion, down by 4% from its 2017 projected investment of less than $19 billion. Next year's budget is also around 18% lower than the company’s 2016 spending of $22.4 billion and down 46% from the 2015 expenditure of $34 billion.Revised downward for the fifth consecutive year, the second-biggest U.S. oil and gas group's cut in capital spending reflects Chevron's plans to optimize its expenses, while relying increasingly on shale drilling.During the nine months ended Sep 30, 2017, Chevron incurred capital expenditure of $13.4 billion, approximately 89% of which went toward its upstream segment.Analyzing Chevron's 2018 Capital BudgetOf the American multinational's total 2018 capital expenditure, a little over 86% is planned to be incurred in its upstream operations. In particular, Chevron is concentrating on increasing its investment in shale as it strives to boost its U.S. shale production next year. For 2018, the company intends to spend $4.3 billion in shale – up 70% year over year – the lion's share (or $3.3 billion) going to the lucrative Permian Basin of Texas and New Mexico alone. The remaining $1 billion has been set aside for other shale investments. Overall, the oil giant plans to shell out $6.6 billion for its domestic upstream operations. An additional $9.2 billion will target international upstream projects.Over the last few years, majority of the capital expenditure in its 'Upstream' segment were dedicated to Australian LNG projects – Gorgon and Wheatstone – and the Tengiz field in Kazakhstan. But having completed both Gorgon and Wheatstone, Tengiz remains the only large capital project Chevron is committed to, for which the company has allocated $3.7 billion out of a total $5.5 billion for projects already underway. Meanwhile, Chevron has earmarked approximately $8.7 billion to sustain currently producing upstream assets.According to Chevron's outgoing chief executive, John Watson, the company is looking to concentrate on projects that offer a combination of “strong production growth and solid free cash flow”. In fact, Chevron expects 75% of its exploration and production spending to realize cash flows in two years of investment – most of these projects being shale developments.The Permian AdvantageExperts say that it’s cheaper to drill and complete oil wells in the Permian Basin than most other major fields. Moreover, there are certain parts of the shale play whose well-returns are the best in the U.S. With crude prices still down significantly from their 2014 levels, well returns have become a very important metric to gauge profitability.Permian’s attractive economics means that producers can still make money there at the current, just over-$50-a-barrel price. This is mainly because of the region's extensive pipeline infrastructure, plentiful labor and supplies, and relatively warm winters that makes year-round work possible. Most other domestic shale regions need prices above $60 to support new developments and expansions.Apart from Chevron, other large U.S. oil producers ramping up shale investments are ExxonMobil Corporation (XOM  -  Free Report) and ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report).Zacks Rank & Stock PicksChevron currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), implying that it is expected to perform in line with the broader U.S. equity market over the next one to three months.Meanwhile, one can look at a better-ranked integrated energy player like BP plc (BP  -  Free Report) that sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

1594,COP,"Calgary, Alberta-based Suncor Energy Inc. (SU  -  Free Report) has recently applied to the Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency (CEAA) with the aim to replace its aging coke-fired boilers at its oil sands Base Plant with two cogeneration units. The purpose of the move is to reduce cost and carbon emissions from the facility. This will also enable the company to generate 700 megawatts (MW) of electricity to be sold to the provincial grid. Notably, the generated electricity will equal 7% of the present electricity demand in Alberta, Canada.Additionally, the step taken by the integrated energy player will enable it to increase its presence in Alberta's electricity grid. This is also an important initiative on the company’s part against climate change. The two cogeneration units will in fact use steam instead of coal for operations. It will also help Alberta's transition toward low carbon intensity energy sources.Other than oil sands Base Plant, the company also has cogeneration units at its Firebag, Fort Hills and MacKay River facilities, where it supplies low-carbon electricity to the provincial grid.The company has plans to take the final call on constructing two cogeneration units by the fourth quarter of 2018 and start the process in 2019. Commissioning of the project is anticipated to begin from 2022.About Suncor EnergySuncor's operations include oil sands development and upgrade, conventional and offshore crude oil and gas production, petroleum refining and product marketing under the Petro-Canada brand. This apart, the company explores, acquires, develops, produces and markets crude oil and natural gas in Canada and internationally. Plus it transports and refines crude oil and markets petroleum as well as petrochemical products primarily in Canada. Suncor’s business can be divided into three main segments: Oil Sands, Exploration and Production (E&P) and Refining and Marketing.Through its aggressive expense management, Suncor has been able to lower its cash costs amid the industry downturn. This has further helped the company take advantage of the rebound in oil prices. Moreover, Suncor's healthy financial profile allows it to pay an attractive dividend while pursuing an assertive share repurchase program.However, Suncor’s major focus lies on crude-oil production from Alberta oil sands. This is a high-risk strategy considering the extra costs associated with extraction of oil from the oil sands compared with the production from conventional oil wells.Price PerformanceSuncor has gained 5% year to date against 11.6% decline of its industry.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderSuncor has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1595,COP,"The U.S. Energy Department's inventory release showed that crude stockpiles recorded a higher-than-expected weekly draw.But the positive effect from the hefty crude inventory draw was more than offset by a massive build in gasoline supplies. On a further bearish note, domestic oil production maintained its steadily rising trend that continues to be the biggest headwind for the market.As a result, the front month West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures lost 2.9% (or $1.66) to end at $55.96 per barrel yesterday – the lowest settlement since Nov 16, while gasoline fell to its lowest in about seven weeks.Energy Stocks SlumpThe federal data sparked widespread selling in energy stocks, which pushed the Energy Select Sector SPDR – an assortment of the largest U.S. energy companies – down almost 1.3% Wednesday.The two energy representatives in the 30-stock Dow Jones industrial average, ExxonMobil (XOM  -  Free Report) and Chevron (CVX  -  Free Report) were down 0.7%. Meanwhile, some of the biggest casualties of the S&P 500 were oil and oil-related stocks like Newfield Exploration Co. (NFX  -  Free Report), Range Resources Corp. (RRC  -  Free Report) and Southwestern Energy Co. (SWN  -  Free Report).Analysis of the EIA DataCrude Oil: The federal government’s EIA report revealed that crude inventories fell by 5.6 million barrels for the week ending Dec 1, following a decrease of 3.4 million barrels in the previous week. The analysts surveyed by S&P Global Platts – the leading independent commodities and energy data provider – had expected crude stocks to go down some 4.1 million barrels.An uptick in refinery demand and lower imports led to the larger-than-expected stockpile draw with the world's biggest oil consumer even as U.S. output rose by 25,000 barrels per day last week to 9.7 million barrels per day – the most since the EIA started maintaining weekly data in 1983.Oil stockpiles have shrunk in 27 of the last 35 weeks and are down more than 85 million barrels since April. The gradual fall has helped the U.S. crude market shift from year-over-year storage surplus to a deficit. At 448.1 million barrels, current crude supplies are 7.8% below the year-ago period though they are in the upper half of the average range during this time of the year.Meanwhile, stocks at the Cushing terminal in Oklahoma – the key delivery hub for U.S. crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange – was down by 2.8 million barrels to 55.6 million barrels.The crude supply cover was down from 27.2 days in the previous week to 26.5 days. In the year-ago period, the supply cover was 29.8 days.Gasoline: Supplies of gasoline were up for the fourth straight week as demand remained weak. The large, 6.8 million barrels addition – more than double the polled number of 2.7 million barrels rise in supply level – took gasoline stockpiles up to 220.9 million barrels. Despite last week’s increase, the existing stock of the most widely used petroleum product remains 3.7% below the year-earlier level but is in the middle of the average range.Distillate: Distillate fuel supplies (including diesel and heating oil) was up 1.7 million barrels last week, greater than analysts’ expectations for 1.5 million barrels increase in supply level. The weekly rise could be attributed to healthy production and lower demand. At 129.4 million barrels, current supplies are 17.4% below the year-ago level and are in the lower half of the average range for this time of the year.Refinery Rates: Refinery utilization was up by 1.2% from the prior week to 93.8%.About the Weekly Petroleum Status ReportThe Energy Information Administration (EIA) Petroleum Status Report, containing data of the previous week ending Friday, outlines information regarding the weekly change in petroleum inventories held and produced by the U.S., both locally and abroad.The report provides an overview of the level of reserves and their movements, thereby helping investors understand the demand/supply dynamics of petroleum products. It is an indicator of current oil prices and volatility that affect the businesses of the companies engaged in the oil and refining industry.Want to Own an Energy Stock Now?If you are looking for a near-term energy play, ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report) may be a good selection.

1596,COP,"Chevron Corporation (CVX  -  Free Report) recently announced its capital and exploratory spending program for 2018. Budget for capital projects is reserved at $18.3 billion, lower than this year’s estimate of $19.8 billion. Per the company, capital spending for the next three years will be in the range of $17-$22 billion per annum. Of the total budget for 2018, $5.5 billion is meant for affiliated companies' expenses.The overall 2018 budget is 4% lower than the one provided for 2017. It has been declining for the last four years. Per the company, it is focusing on growth projects, which will add to the company's cash flow in the next two years, including the Permian Basin assets. Completion of several projects and enhanced efficiencies in the company’s operations were also responsible for the lowered budget for 2018.  The company however expects production to grow in the coming year driven by its Permian Basin play. To sustain the current producing assets, the company will bear costs of around $8.7 billion, of which $3.3 billion will be utilized for the Permian Basin. Per Chevron, $1.0 billion will be used for other shale and tight rock investments. The company's assets in the Tengiz field of Kazakhstan were allotted $3.7 billion while the downstream projects were allotted $2.2 billion. About the CompanySan Ramon, CA-based Chevron is one of the largest publicly traded oil and gas companies in the world, based on proved reserves. It is engaged in oil and gas exploration and production, refining and marketing of petroleum products, manufacturing of chemicals, and other energy-related businesses. The company divides its operations into two main segments: Upstream and Downstream.In the third quarter, Chevron generated $5.4 billion in operating cash flow, while shelling out around $5.2 billion in capital expenditures and dividends. This led to around $200 million in excess cash flows - something the company achieved for the first time since 2012. Going forward, we expect Chevron's free cash flow to improve significantly given the company's initiatives to reduce costs, exit unprofitable markets and streamline the organization.However, we remain concerned about the challenges faced by Chevron's U.S. production. The company produced 681 thousand oil-equivalent barrels per day in the third quarter, down 2.4% year over year and 2.9% sequentially. The poor performance of the region – despite output increases in the Gulf of Mexico and the Permian basin – could be attributed to asset sales and natural field declines in other areas.Chevron has gained 1.6% year to date compared with 3.4% growth of its industry.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderChevron has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the oil and energy sector include ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report), Northern Oil and Gas, Inc.

1597,COP,"Energy infrastructure provider Kinder Morgan, Inc. (KMI  -  Free Report) recently announced its forecast for 2018. The company expects distributable cash flow (DCF) of $4.57 billion for the year.The company expects DCF per share to be $2.05 and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) of $7.5 billion. Both the figures are expected to be higher than the 2017 numbers based on the projects coming online in 2017 and 2018. Kinder Morgan expects to have $500 million in hand, after rewarding stockholders with planned dividend, for share repurchases and investing in high yielding projects.  In 2018, Kinder Morgan anticipates dividend per common share to rise up to 80 cents, while in 2019 and 2020 the same is expected to rise to $1.00 and $1.25, respectively. The company intends to end the year 2018 with a net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio at 5.1. Also, it has plans to invest around $2.2 billion in various expansion projects. Notably, expenses related to the Gulf Coast Express project, which is yet to be incorporated in the company's backlog, have been included in the company's 2018 budget. The company has no plans to depend on the equity markets in 2018 for discretionary spending.In December 2017, the company's $2 billion share buyback program will commence as planned. Execution of the program will result in the repurchase of 5% of outstanding shares of the company.The company generates revenues primarily through its fee-based structure, thus eliminating the effects of change in commodity prices. However, Kinder Morgan's CO2 segment possesses commodity price sensitivity where it uses the process of hedging to reduce price sensitivity. Investors should know that the company expects the price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil to be $56.50 per barrel and Henry Hub natural gas price to be $3.00 per one million British thermal units (MMBtu).   About the CompanyTX-based Kinder has the largest network of natural gas pipeline in North America that spreads over almost 70,000 miles. Most importantly, the company’s midstream properties are linked to all the prospective plays in the U.S. that are rich in natural gas.However, we are concerned about Kinder Morgan’s weak balance sheet. As of Sep 30, 2017, total debt – both short and long-term – was $38.3 billion. The debt capital is higher than the total equity capital of $36.5 billion, which shows the company’s significant exposure to debt. Also, Kinder Morgan has lost 17.3% year to date compared with 2.8% decline of its industry.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderKinder Morgan has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the oil and energy sector include ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report), Northern Oil and Gas, Inc.

1598,COP,"Brazilian state-run Petróleo Brasileiro S.A. or Petrobras (PBR  -  Free Report) recently announced that it has signed separate deals with China Development Bank (""CDB"") and Unipec Asia Company, a subsidiary of China Petroleum & Chemical Corporation (SNP  -  Free Report).The financing agreement with CDB worth $5 billion will mature in 2027. Per the agreement, half of the payment of the financing contract will be made this month while the rest will be paid in January 2018, following the company's payment of $2.8 billion to CDB related to a loan taken in 2009.The deal is in line with the company's liabilities management strategy. The lone agreement also signifies that the company has emerged from the threat to its credit rating caused by the multibillion-dollar money laundering and bribery case.In the separate deal with Unipec Asia Company, Petrobras signed a 10-year long contract, which requires it to supply 100,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (Boe/d). The integrated energy company‘s supply contract with Unipec Asia Company will replace a 2009 contract between the two companies, which was supposed to expire in 2019 and authorized Petrobras to supply 200,000 Boe/d.About the CompanyHeadquartered in Rio de Janeiro, Petrobras is the largest integrated energy firm in Brazil and one of the largest in Latin America. The company’s activities include: exploration, exploitation and production of oil from reservoir wells, shale and other rocks, as well as refining, processing, trading and transportation of oil and oil products, natural gas and other fluid hydrocarbons, in addition to other energy-related activities. The company operates in six segments: Exploration and Production (E&P), Refining, Transportation and Marketing, Distribution, Gas and Power, Biofuels and International.Considering Brazil's huge pre-salt oil reserves – estimated at 9.5 to 14 billion barrels of oil equivalent and widely thought to be the most important oil find in recent years – we believe Petrobras is in an enviable position to maintain an impressive production growth profile for years to come.However, the company has massive debt loads as it carries a net debt of more than $88 billion, with net debt-to-capitalization ratio approximately 51%. As such, leverage remains a key area of concern for the firm.In addition, Petrobras has lost 2.5% of its value year to date against 5.7% growth of its industry.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderPetrobras has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the oil and energy sector include ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report) and Holly Energy Partners, L.P.

1599,COP,"Oilfield service provider TechnipFMC plc (FTI  -  Free Report) has been awarded a contract worth $4.2 billion by the Bahrain Petroleum Company (Bapco) for its only refinery, Sitra.Per the contract, South Korea’s Samsung Engineering and Spain's Tecnicas Reunidas will join TechnipFMC for the Bapco Modernization Program, which is located on the Eastern coast of Bahrain. The project requires these companies to increase Sitra's capacity to 360,000 barrels per day (bpd) from its existing capacity of 267,000 bpd. The project is also aimed at increasing the energy efficiency of the refinery as well as meeting the environmental criteria. The modernization project is expected to improve the technologies used at the refinery, following which, even a low oil price environment would not affect its ability to earn good margins.Per the deal, the project is expected to be completed by 2022 and will be carried out as an engineering, procurement, construction and commissioning (EPCC) contract. TechnipFMC will lead the project. The company believes that the contract will strengthen its leadership position in the oilfield service providing sector.About TechnipFMCLondon-based TechnipFMC is a leading manufacturer and supplier of technology solutions for the energy industry. The company, which reached its current form following the January 2017 merger between Technip and FMC Technologies, is engaged in designing, producing and servicing technologically sophisticated systems and products for subsea, onshore/offshore, and surface projects.Amid reduced activity and pricing pressure, TechnipFMC has been able to maintain attractive operating margins courtesy of its relentless cost reductions combined with excellent project execution. Continued strong execution on Yamal and an improving pipeline of projects have boosted the offshore/onshore segment of the company.However, TechnipFMC’s subsea segment, which was once its largest and fastest growing unit, is facing revenue and margin pressure due to volatile pricing. In the recent quarter, Subsea revenues and profits declined a respective 37% and 71.3% year over year.TechnipFMC has lost 18.6% of its value year to date compared with 31.1% decline of its industry.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderThe company has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the oil and energy sector include ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report), Northern Oil and Gas, Inc.

1600,COP,"ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report) has finalized the terms of payment by the Republic of Ecuador under a February 2017 International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) arbitration award. The payment will be made to the company’s wholly-owned subsidiary — Burlington.  Per the agreement, ConocoPhillips will receive a total of $337 million from Ecuador. On Dec 1, 2017, the company recovered $75 million from Ecuador, while the remaining $262 million will be paid by April 2018.The settlement amount consists of a compensation of $42 million to Ecuador for decisions on its counterclaims, of which Burlington is allowed an extra $24 million through a third-party contribution.  In December 2012, the ICSID Tribunal ruled that Ecuador illegally seized the company's considerable oil investments in Blocks 7 and 21, in breach of the U.S.-Ecuador bilateral investment treaty.In February 2016, the tribunal issued a reward on damages. In August 2017, the ICSID Annulment Committee lifted the stay of enforcement, permitting ConocoPhillips to begin enforcing the award.  About ConocoPhillipsConocoPhillips is a major global exploration and production (E&P) company with operations and activities in 21 countries. The company is involved in exploration, development and production of crude oil and natural gas worldwide.The bulk of acres that ConocoPhillips holds in the Eagle Ford shale and Permian basin are rich in oil.

1601,COP,"ExxonMobil Corporation’s (XOM  -  Free Report) wholly owned affiliate — ExxonMobil Exploration and Production Mauritania Deepwater Ltd. — has inked production sharing contracts with the government of Mauritania. The contracts are related to three deepwater offshore blocks — C22, C17 and C14.Located at approximately 124 miles, or 200 kilometers, offshore Mauritania, the three blocks are spread over nearly 8.4 million acres in water depths ranging from 3,300 feet to 11,500 feet, or 1,000 meters to more than 3,500 meters.ExxonMobil will commence exploration activities along with acquisition of seismic data and analysis only after it receives consent of the government for the contracts.ExxonMobil, being the operator of the blocks, will perform the activities with a stake of 90%. The remaining 10% will be held by Societe Mauritanienne des Hydrocarbures et de Patrimoine Minier.ExxonMobil’s global deepwater acreage position is further strengthened with these agreements. The company’s is well poised on the back of competence and advanced technology.Recently, the company acquired Statoil ASA’s  50% stake in the prospective BM-S-8 block, located off the coast of Brazil. The purchase was in line with ExxonMobil’s strategy to explore oil resources from the field. The company’s decision to invest in the pre-salt Carcara oil field is noteworthy. The field is expected to contain as high as 2 billion barrels of high-quality recoverable oil reserves.About ExxonMobilExxonMobil has a leading position in the energy industry owing to the size and diversity of asset base, in terms of business mix and geographical footprint. With a stable cash position, the company’s balance sheet is considered among the best in the industry. However, due to its integrated functions, the company is susceptible to risk from any weakness in the global economy. Moreover, dependence on costly offshore drilling might dent ExxonMobil’s cash flow.Shares of the company have returned 8.2% compared with the industry’s rally of 10.4% in the last three months.Zacks Rank & Other Key PicksExxonMobil currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

1602,COP,"In the Global Week Ahead, to find the biggest fundamental catalyst for stock markets, target the usual suspect at the top of a month – the latest U.S. non-farm payroll report.On Wednesday, the ADP private payroll report lands. This is a foreshadowing of the preliminary Federal number out on Friday.What’s the backdrop going into the report? Last week’s U.S. unemployment claims remained low at 238K. A lagging indicator is the U.S. household unemployment rate. It rests at 4.1%. That’s low too.So Friday’s economist consensus sees monthly job additions number at around +200K for November. That’s a muddle-through call.Nonetheless, this updated coincident indicator will get studied in great detail.Perhaps the most closely watched internal numbers become the annual wage growth figures. These are a ‘tell’ on any future pickup in U.S. consumer inflation. In turn, that would get the Federal Open Market Committee’s full attention.In the halls of Congress, the U.S. is still a fair distance from enacting a tax plan.The Senate version and House version now go into ‘conference.’ In this set of joint meetings, the House and Senate hash out a common agreement to bridge differences. They will re-submit a single proposal to both chambers.This Friday, there is an expiring deadline on funding needed to keep the U.S. government open. In other words, a debt ceiling and spending appropriation deadline looms. This opens up a rather small possibility of a government shutdown.Not to be put on a back burner, the Mueller investigation can surely intensify.Across the Global Week Ahead, central banks outside the USA will make important policy rate setting decisions.On Wednesday, in Latin America, consensus expects the Banco Central do Brasil to cut its Selic monetary policy rate by 50 basis points.  Last week, South Korea became the first major Asian central bank since 2014 to hike interest rates.That was a sign the ‘great unwinding’ of crisis-era low interest rates are spreading. Resurgent growth in Europe and the U.S. has benefitted Asia.Who is next? Further south, count on Australia to keep rates on hold this week. Focus instead on whether there is any hint of a possible hike next year.Reserve Banks in Canada and India also hold monetary policy meetings prior to the U.S. payroll report. Top Zacks Stock Picks—Some stocks to watch…Rio Tinto (RIO  -  Free Report): China is getting Asia moving. That keeps materials companies busy. This stock is a $67 billion market cap iron ore mining company based in western Australia. The stock carries a Zacks long-term VGM score of A.ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report): Don’t forget about the latest rise in global oil prices. This U.S. based oil and gas integrated player is a Zacks #1 Rank now. It has a long-term Zacks VGM score of C.Lam Research (LRCX  -  Free Report): Yes, the semiconductor stocks got hit hard last week. This week, keep a close eye on the trading action in this industry. This widely held stock is back to a Zacks #1 Rank, and the long-term Zacks VGM score is A.That set of stock metrics says the fire will be re-lit on semi chip stocks soon.???Key Global Macro—The biggest fundamental catalysts this week come from the U.S. jobs market.On Wednesday, the ADP private payrolls report will be released.On Friday, the key non-farm payroll report for the USA lands. Consensus looks for moderate job gains of around a 200k monthly pace for November.Given the tightness in labor markets, wage growth could accelerate.On Monday, Greece’s GDP growth rate should be +0.8% y/y. Meanwhile, Turkey’s Consumer Price Inflation is running hot at +12.98% y/y.On Tuesday, the monetary policy base rate in Poland gets re-set. It should remain at 1.5%.The Reserve Bank of Australia should keep its overnight rate at 1.5% too.The Irish services PMI rests at 57.5. We get a new reading here.The Spanish services PMI rests at 54.6. It gets re-set too.The German services PMI rests at 54.9. It gets re-set.The Eurozone composite PMI rests at 57.5. We get the final reading. Eurozone services rests at 56.2.Retail sales in the Eurozone stands at +4.7% y/y. We get a fresh reading.On Wednesday, the Bank of Canada (BoC) holds a monetary policy meting. Its latest policy rate is at 1.0% and is not expected to change.The Reserve Bank of India (the RBI) holds a monetary policy meeting too.  The reverse repo rate stands at 5.75% and it is not expected to move.The U.S. ADP employment survey comes out. It was at +235K.The ECB’s Draghi speaks in Brussels.On Thursday, the unemployment rate for Italy comes out. It has been at 11.2%.The unemployment rate for Greece is 20.6%.U.S. initial claims look low at 238K, once again.Mexico’s closely watched inflation rate comes out. It has been at +6.37% y/y and could climb to +6.59% y/y.On Friday, the key U.S. non-farm payroll report lands. The prior reading was 261K, and the unemployment rate was 4.1%.  The University of Michigan consumer sentiment index is at 98.5. We get a fresh reading.

1613,COP,"Seasoned investors always look for a plan that is likely to yield high returns irrespective of market conditions. Efficiency level, which measures a company’s capability to transform its available input into output, is often considered an important parameter used to gauge a company’s potential to rake in handsome returns.A company with a favorable efficiency level is expected to provide stellar returns as it is believed to be positively correlated with its price performance. Key Ratios to Identify EfficiencySometimes it becomes difficult to measure the efficiency level of a company. This is the reason why one must consider popular efficiency ratios while selecting stocks. These efficiency ratios are:Inventory Turnover: The ratio of 12-month cost of goods sold (COGS) to a four-quarter average inventory is considered one of the most popular efficiency ratios. It indicates a company’s ability to maintain a suitable inventory position. While a high value indicates that the company has a relatively low level of inventory compared to COGS, a low value indicates that the company is facing declining sales, which resulted in excess inventory. Receivables Turnover:  This is the ratio of 12-month sales to four-quarter average receivables. It shows a company’s potential to extend its credit and collect debt in terms of that credit. A high receivables turnover ratio or the “accounts receivable turnover ratio” or “debtor’s turnover ratio” is desirable as it shows that the company is capable of collecting its accounts receivables or that it has quality customers.Asset Utilization: This ratio indicates a company’s capability to convert assets into output and is thus a widely known measure of efficiency level. It is calculated by dividing total sales over the past 12 months by the last four-quarter average of total assets. Like the above ratios, high asset utilization may indicate that a company is efficient.Operating Margin: This efficiency measure is the ratio of operating income over the past 12 months to sales over the same period. It measures a company’s ability to control operating expenses. Hence, a high value of the ratio may indicate that the company manages its operating expenses more efficiently than its peers.Screening ParametersIn addition to the above-mentioned ratios, we have added a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to the screen with an objective to make this strategy more profitable. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Inventory Turnover, Receivables Turnover, Asset Utilization and Operating Margin greater than industry average (Values of these ratios higher than industry averages may indicate that the efficiency level of the company is higher than its peers.)    The use of these few criteria has narrowed down the universe of over 7,906 stocks to only 17.Here are four stocks from the 17 that made it through the screen:NVR, Inc. (NVR  -  Free Report) is engaged in the construction and sale of single-family detached homes, townhomes and condominium buildings.

1614,COP,"North American energy firm The Williams Companies, Inc. (WMB  -  Free Report) reported adjusted earnings from continuing operations of 15 cents per share missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 19 cents. Higher impairment charges incurred during the quarter along with unfavorable changes in the income tax provision led to the weaker-than-expected results.Further, the bottom line also deteriorated from the prior-year figure of 20 cents per share. This was mainly due to the absence of gains associated with the Geismar olefins facility which was divested on Jul 6.  Higher costs and lower adjusted profit from William Partners L.P. (WPZ  -  Free Report) also led to lower year-over-year earnings.For the quarter ended Sep 30, 2017, Williams Companies reported revenues of $1,891 million, above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,825 million. However, revenues decreased from the year-ago quarter figure of $1,905 million.  Williams Companies, Inc. (The) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Williams Companies, Inc. (The) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Williams Companies, Inc. (The) QuoteSegmental AnalysisWilliams Partners: This segment reported adjusted operating profit of $1,101 million, down 7.4% from $1,189 million in the year-ago quarter. Unfavorable impacts from the disruptive hurricanes along with the absence of results from the Geismar facility and higher costs led to weaker results. Other: The segment posted adjusted operating profit of $12 million compared with the year-ago profit of $3 million. Results were mainly driven by the absence of unfavorable results from certain former Canadian operations which were offloaded in September 2016.Expenses SummaryThe total cost and expenses increased 3.5% to $1,614 million in the reported quarter compared with $1,560 million in the prior-year quarter. Increased costs were primarily driven by higher impairment charges of $1,210 million incurred in the reported quarter as against $1 million in the third quarter of 2016. However, this was mainly offset by $1,095 million gain on sale of Geismar facility.Further, operating and maintenance costs (O&M) and product costs also rose in the quarter under review.Capital Expenditure & Balance SheetDuring the reported quarter, Williams Companies’ capital expenditure was $644 million. As of Sep 30, 2017, the company had cash and cash equivalents of 1,172 million, as against $77 million in the year ago quarter.

1616,COP,"Integrated oil giant BP plc's (BP  -  Free Report) Brazilian subsidiary, BP Biofuels, recently agreed to form a joint venture (JV) with the country's ethanol merchant, Copersucar. The JV will own and operate the ethanol storage complex in Paulínia, Brazil. The ethanol storage terminal, presently owned by Copersucar, is the largest in the country. The terminal is well connected with different shipping networks, which is expected to help the companies to reach the main ethanol consumer markets in the country.The announcement of the JV followed the legislation passed by Brazil’s lower house of Congress, which proposes to increase biofuels usage in the country.While BP Biofuels produces ethanol from sugarcane, Copersucar is a major sugar and ethanol trader. The deal will thus help the company to expand its value chain. The move is also one of the company's strategies to reduce its carbon footprint, as it believes that biofuels will gradually replace fossil fuels. It also believes that people looking for alternative fuels to fight climate change will opt for biofuels in the coming years. Hence, the deal is expected to help the company meet the growing demand for this type of fuel. It will also increase the company’s presence in the country.The financial details of the deal are yet to be disclosed.About the Company London-based BP is among the leading integrated energy players in the world. Currently, the company reports mainly through four segments – Upstream, Downstream, Rosneft and Other Businesses and Corporate.Recently, BP appraised its exploration portfolio. It reiterated its focus on growth of natural gas and advantaged oil in regions where it presently functions. The company is also seeking prospects to develop production regions while abandoning less-competitive exploration prospects. This is clearly reflected in the company’s sale of Bruce assets for £300 million. These initiatives will likely support the company with growing and sustainable free cash flow, which it can distribute among shareholders.Price Performance BP has gained 7.2% year to date compared with 4.4% growth of its industry.Zacks Rank and Key PicksBP sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Some other top-ranked stocks in the oil and energy sector include ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report), Northern Oil and Gas, Inc.

1617,COP,"Magellan Midstream Partners, L.P. (MMP  -  Free Report) along with Plains All American Pipeline, L.P. (PAA  -  Free Report), its joint venture partner in BridgeTex Pipeline Company, LLC, announced plans to increase the capacity of the BridgeTex pipeline by 40,000 barrels per day (bpd). The joint venture also announced an additional open season to evaluate the demand for increased capacity, which will give potential customers an opportunity to come out with binding commitments by Dec 30, 2017.The open season activities in the region are primarily driven by a rise in drilling activities in the Permian Basin. Active rig count in the region has been on the rise for quite some time now, which triggered the interest of pipeline manufacturers in the area. The latest expansion decision on BridgeTex comes on the heels of a long-term deal signed in July between a Singapore-based commodity trading company, Trafigura Pte Ltd and Plains All American Pipeline.

1619,COP,"Upstream oil company, Carrizo Oil & Gas, Inc. (CRZO  -  Free Report) recently agreed to divest all its Denver-Julesburg Basin assets for a total consideration of $140 million. The deal will also fetch Carrizo up to $15 million in contingent payments over the next three years, which depends on oil price level surpassing a predetermined limit. The company is yet to declare the name of the buyer.  Carrizo expects the transaction, which has an effective date of Sep 1, 2017, to close in January 2018. In the third quarter, the DJ Basin assets produced 2,427 net barrels of oil equivalent per day (Boe/d), of which 69% was oil.The divestment is in line with the company's strategy, announced earlier this year, to sell its non-core assets.  The sale will also help it to lower its debt burden. It is to be noted that as of Sep 30, 2017, the company had long-term debt of $226 million.On top of that, the divestiture program of the non-core assets has left the company with core oil and gas resources that include 103,000 net acres in Eagle Ford Shale along with 43,600 net acres in the Delaware Basin. Per Carrizo, the sale of the assets will enable the company to deliver strong and high-return production growth.Carrizo stock, which has been volatile and trading within the range of $17.69–$20.16 in the past 30-day time-frame, witnessed a sharp decrease of 9.3%, following the news. Analysts believe that the price Carrizo secured from the deal is below its expected level of $200 million.

1620,COP,"Will Chevron Corporation (CVX  -  Free Report) raise its dividend soon?The question is back on the table with U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) recently climbing to a two-and-half year high settlement of $58.95 a barrel. Struggling for much of the past three years, the energy industry looks to have finally turned a corner, courtesy of tightening supplies, rising demand and OPEC-deal extension talks.With oil slowly on the mend, shares in energy companies have recovered from their steep slump. At around $58 now, the contract has more than doubled from the dark days of February 2016 when the commodity fell to a 12-year low of just over $26 per barrel. Naturally, this has resulted in a major improvement in Chevron’s fundamentals, and subsequently its share price. In fact, Chevron is up 14.1% in the past six months – a significant rise considering its status as a ‘traditionally defensive play’.Yes, conditions have improved but have they improved enough to warrant a dividend increase from the second-largest U.S. oil company by market value after ExxonMobil Corporation (XOM  -  Free Report)? Because while oil has been on fire, the commodity's success is yet to translate into big gains for Chevron’s dividend investors.Chevron last raised its payout by 1% in October 2016, essentially meaning four quarters of flat dividend. However, the company stills pays its investors an attractive 3.7% yield.Business OverviewSan Ramon, CA-based Chevron is one of the largest publicly traded oil and gas companies in the world, based on proved reserves. It is engaged in oil and gas exploration and production, refining and marketing of petroleum products, manufacturing of chemicals, and other energy-related businesses.A Dividend AristocratThe diversified oil company has a long and consistent dividend paying record. It is one of the only two energy stocks on the list of Dividend Aristocrats - a group of 51 companies in the S&P 500 Index that have raised their payouts for more than 25 years in a row. Chevron has increased its dividend for 29 consecutive years compared to 34 for ExxonMobil, the other energy Dividend Aristocrat.How Safe is Chevron’s Dividend?Like all energy companies (big or small), Chevron is also susceptible to the oil market ups and downs. During the commodity price collapse, the company’s cash from operations fell far short of its capital spending. Therefore, when ExxonMobil remained free cash flow-positive throughout the downturn, Chevron – one of the most oil-weighted majors – relied on asset sales and debt to plug the deficit.Yet, the company continued to reward shareholders with a large annual dividend of $4.28 per share – yielding around 4%. Not only that, Chevron even upped its dividend in 2016 when the pricing environment was far more challenging.The good news is, things have changed for the better in 2017. A stable floor under oil price, together with asset sales and lower operating expenses helped boost profits. Therefore, Chevron's dividend appears to be relatively safe, thanks to improvement in its cash generating potential.Strong Cash Flow from OperationsDuring the last nine months, the oil major reported a sharp year-over-year increase in cash flow from operating activities, which is a key metric to gauge the financial health of the firm. The company generated enough cash to pay off debt along with funding capex and dividend payments.With commodity prices on their way up, Chevron reported net earnings of around $6.1 billion in the first nine months of 2017, turning around from the year-ago corresponding period’s net loss of $912 million. Importantly, the supermajor reported $14.3 billion in cash flow from operations, up from $9 billion in the year-ago period.In the third quarter, Chevron generated $5.4 billion in operating cash flow, while shelling out around $5.2 billion in capital expenditures and dividends. This led to around $200 million in excess cash flows - something the company achieved for the first time since 2012. Going forward, we expect Chevron's free cash flow to improve significantly amid the company's initiatives in cost reduction, exiting unprofitable markets and streamlining the organization.Business Model Adapting to $50 CrudeThe robust cash flows underscore the fact that Chevron can not only survive but also flourish at $50 a barrel. The remodeling of portfolio and strategies have made the firm way more resilient to reduced crude prices, thus achieving break-even at $50 a barrel or even lower.Break-even price is one of the popular metrics to determine the success of oil companies. It indicates the oil price which a company requires to generate enough cash to meet its dividend and capex requirements.An Imminent Payout Hike Still Looks UnlikelyDespite profit rising from a year earlier and Chevron transforming itself from a cash guzzler to a cash generator, we do not expect the company to raise its quarterly dividend at least through the first half of 2018.The commodity price environment, while improving all the time, still remains challenging and Chevron might ideally want to strengthen its modest free cash flow surplus before rushing into a dividend hike. And while investors would like the company to make it 30 successive years of dividend increase, we believe Chevron would not want to undo its great work over the past couple of years. In fact, a flat but stable payout amid higher cash generation will ensure that more money can be put back into the company, making it stronger, financially healthier, and possibly a better income investment for the future.Zacks Rank & Stock PicksChevron currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), implying that it is expected to perform in line with the broader U.S. equity market over the next one to three months.Meanwhile, one can look at better-ranked energy players like ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report) and BP plc (BP  -  Free Report).

1622,COP,"Statoil ASA  has entered into an agreement with Total SA (TOT  -  Free Report) to acquire equity interests in two fields — Martin Linge and the Garantiana— from the latter for a total consideration of $1.45 billion. The fields are located in the Norwegian continental shelf (NCS).Statoil will acquire a 51% stake in the Martin Linge field and 40% in the Garantiana discovery.About Martin LingeMartin Linge is an oil and gas field under development. Located to the west of the Oseberg field in the North Sea, it is estimated to have recoverable resources of more than 300 million barrels of oil equivalent. The production lifetime is expected to extend into the 2030s.Development of the oil field is being done via a manned wellhead platform. The installation of a jacket substructure in the North Sea has been completed. The topside is being concluded at the Samsung yard in South Korea and is expected to be transferred to Norway by early 2018.The field faced a number of schedule postponement and cost increments owing to deferred topside engineering, construction and currency impact along with a disastrous accident at the yard. The current operator anticipates the field to come online in the first half of 2019. Since the formation of Plan for Development and Operation, there has been an increase in recoverable resources owing to additional discoveries.In order to lower expenditures, operations will be controlled remotely from an onshore digital operations centre. Electrification will be achieved via a 160 kilometer cable from shore, the longest AC power link in the world. This will enable CO2 emissions to decline 200,000 tons per year. On completion of the transaction, Statoil’s holding in the field will increase to 70% from 19%.When in operation, Martin Linge will be a modern production facility with low production cost and low carbon footprint. Per the transaction, Statoil will also receive remaining tax balances with a nominal post-tax value of over $1 billion.About GarantianaAn oil discovery — Garantiana —  is located north of the Visund field in the North Sea. The field is estimated to have recoverable resource potential in the range of 50-70 million barrels oil equivalent. Currently, development concepts are being assessed.Per the applicable legislation including required information and consultation process, Statoil will take over important employees from Total.The agreed purchase price is based on an effective date of Jan 1, 2017. The amount payable is subject to adjustment on completion of the transaction in 2018.

1623,COP,"Enbridge Inc. (ENB  -  Free Report) stated that it has struck an accord with the State of Michigan to replace the aging Line 5 pipelines. The pipeline traverses along the bottom of a channel between Lakes Huron and Michigan. Concerns regarding the negative impacts on the Lake, following a leak, have been increasing. Laid in 1953, the pipelines carry 540,000 barrel a day.Per the deal, the company will carry out an evaluation by June 2018 on three options to replace the seven-kilometer stretch of underwater pipeline and observe safety measures to reduce the possibility of a leak.The replacement options comprise the installment of a new pipeline in a tunnel under the Straits of Mackinac, placing a new pipeline below the lakebed via advanced drilling techniques and excavating a channel in the bottom of the Great Lakes. Consequently, the pipeline will be placed within a secondary enclosure in the channel.However, other contenders for the project have demanded complete closure of the pipeline after Enbridge’s involvement. They are of the opinion that gaps have been created in the pipeline’s protective coating in recent months. These elevate concerns relating to the deteriorating condition of the pipeline.Keeping in mind its aging condition, Enbridge operates the pipeline at less than 25% of its maximum pressure capacity for safety. However, the company is optimistic about the pipeline’s condition.Price PerformanceShares of the company have lost 9.1% compared with the industry’s decline of 3.7% in the last three months.Zacks RankEnbridge currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

1624,COP,"Magellan Midstream Partners, L.P.’s (MMP  -  Free Report) proposal to build a marketing affiliate has been turned down by the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). This affiliate was expected to focus on buying, selling and transporting oil. It was first proposed in November 2016.Magellan Midstream believes the affiliate would have benefited both the partnership and its clients by focusing on improving operations of its underutilized pipelines. Some of the peers of this energy infrastructure provider have similar marketing affiliates. TransCanada Corporation (TRP  -  Free Report) — a Calgary, Canada-based energy infrastructure company — has its marketing affiliate Marketlink LLC. Similarly, Plains All American Pipeline, L.P. (PAA  -  Free Report) — a Houston, TX-based partnership — has Plains Marketing, L.P.Reason Behind the Disapproval Per FERC, the Interstate Commerce Act prevents a firm to charge different rates for the same services to its clients. The proposal from Magellan Midstream would have established an illegal rebate as the proposed transactions show the marketing affiliate desires to offer capacity below cost, thus violating the Act.Additionally, the proposal sought permission for not publishing the arrangements between the partnership and the subsidiary, which could evade the publication requirements.About the PartnershipMagellan Midstream is a master limited partnership that owns and operates a diversified portfolio of energy infrastructure assets. This Tulsa, OK-based partnership primarily transports, stores, and distributes refined petroleum products and, to a lesser extent, ammonia. Currently, the partnership performs its operations via three segments — Refined Products, Crude Oil and Marine Storage.Furthermore, Magellan Midstream has established a track record of consistent distribution growth. It recently announced a distribution of 90.5 cents per unit ($3.62 per unit annualized), 2% higher than the previous payout and 8% higher than the year-ago quarter figure. In 2016, the partnership achieved its annual distribution growth target of 10%. For both 2017 and 2018, Magellan Midstream projects annual distribution growth of at least 8%.However, Magellan Midstream is facing pressure related to the balance sheet. Over the past five years (2012-2016), long-term debt increased at a CAGR of 14%. Continued rise in project outlays and tough operating environment are the primarily reasons for rise in debt.While the partnership is taking initiates to reduce its indebtedness, it will take some time to witness a rebound. So far this year, units of Magellan Midstream has lost 12.3% compared with 22.9% decline of the industry it belongs to.Zacks Rank & Stock to ConsiderMagellan Midstream carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1625,COP,"TransCanada Corporation’s (TRP  -  Free Report) Keystone XL Pipeline has finally received a regulatory approval from Nebraska commissioners after a prolonged period of delay.  The decision marks a partial victory for Transcanada since the regulators have approved the project on an alternative route rather than the company’s proposed route.  Challenges GaloreThe $8-billion Keystone XL pipeline with 830,000 barrels' capacity was designed to improve oil extraction from Alberta’s oil sands and the Bakken region in the U.S. refineries. The initial phase of the pipeline project was finished in 2011. A proposal was made to add another 1179 miles to the 2100 mile long pipeline. However, the proposed extension was strongly opposed by environmentalists and politicians owing to risks involved of transporting bitumen along with crude to the United States as this might emit greenhouse gases.In November 2015, President Obama rejected TransCanada's application to construct the Keystone XL pipeline on fears that it would weaken United States’ position in the international climate change negotiations. However, in 2017, the project was cleared by President Trump as he was of the opinion that development of such pipelines can revive the economy.However, despite Trump administration's clearance, the pipeline has been facing regulatory obstacles, route challenges and opposition from landowners, environmentalists and Native American tribes.Recently, the company had to stall operations at the existing Keystone pipeline, following a spill of around 5,000 barrels in Marshall County, SD, highlighting the risk posed by the pipeline expansion.The pipeline project which had been already granted approval by Canada, Montana and South Dakota, had been eagerly awaiting a federal ruling from the Nebraska state.What Lies Ahead?Nebraska commissioners’ recent verdict, granting approval to the project on an alternate route, created new problems. Per the company, the originally proposed route was most efficient.  The alternate route will likelyballoon costs and delay the disputed pipeline project further. The alternate route calls for a 63-mile detour and attempts to add 5 miles of pipeline along with additional transmission lines and pumping stations. This will be done avoid regions that are ecologically critical. However, it is unclear as of now whether the alternate path will require any additional approvals.TransCanada and industry advocates as well as governments in Edmonton and Ottawa welcome the approval as they believe that the pipeline is one of the key pillars of North America’s energy securities. The project can create around 42,000 jobs nationwide. However, environmentalists are unhappy with the move as they believe that the pipeline would encourage use of carbon-heavy tar sands oil, increasing global warming.TransCanada announced that it is set to begin the review of Nebraska’s decision to examine the economics of the project. The company will thereby take an official call regarding construction and completion of the pipeline after carefully reevaluating the project’s viability and schedule.  Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderHeadquartered in Alberta, TransCanada mainly focuses on natural gas transmission and power services.

1626,COP,"North American pipeline operator, TransCanada Corp (TRP  -  Free Report) is awaiting a federal ruling for its Keystone extension project. The project has been facing delays for the last nine years and now its future depends on the Nebraska Public Service Commission's verdict. TransCanada’s proposed route for the extension project would pass through most of Nebraska and some parts of Montana and South Dakota until it reaches the Steele City, NE.  The commission will decide for the part of the pipeline which is in Nebraska.Recently, the company had to stall operations at the existing Keystone pipeline, following a spill of around 5,000 barrels in Marshall County, SD. Although the leakage is a shot in the arm for the environmentalists opposing the pipeline's construction in Nebraska, the official decision will depend on the pipeline's importance and not the recent incident and the environmental risks.Importance of the Keystone Extension ProjectThe $8 billion XL extension of 1,179 miles will transport around 830,000 barrels of crude oil a day from Hardisty, Alberta to a junction in Steele City, NE. The pipeline will ultimately reach Gulf of Mexico refineries. The extension project holds strong financial incentive for the company, believe several analysts. Western Canadian crude producers primarily use the train route to move their oil, which is costlier than movement through a pipeline. Completion of this project is expected to reduce crude shipment prices for producers and enhance their bottom line. TransCanada held open season bidding for the pipeline, which ended on Oct 26. Although the results of the open season are yet to be published, the company said that the result is encouraging.Moreover, the refineries in Texas are expected to witness difficulties due to a decline in production in Mexico and political instability in Venezuela.Completion of the project will reduce the risk in supplies of the Texas refineries.Possible VerdictsFavorable: Although the pipeline faced objection from the Obama administration in 2015, Donald Trump summoned the project as per his energy regulations. If the verdict is in favor of TransCanada, it will have to decide on the project's advancement.It may also have to face fresh round of opposition, mainly from environmentalists.Unfavorable: If the verdict turns out to be unfavorable, TransCanada can challenge the judgment in court. It will again add to the delay.Alternate approval: Nebraska regulators can approve the project but ask for an alternate route for the pipeline. Per the company, the proposed route is optimal and most efficient. Hence, this verdict can compound uncertainties surrounding the pipeline. Price Performance TransCanada has gained 8.4% year to date against 6.1% fall of its industry.About the CompanyTransCanada is a North American energy company, focused on natural gas transmission and power services. Its pipeline transports the majority of Western Canada's natural gas production to growing markets in Canada and the United States.As of Sep 30, 2017, the company had long-term debt of C$30,414 with debt to capitalization ratio of 56.9%.Zacks Rank and Stock to ConsiderTransCanada has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the oil and energy sector include ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report), Denbury Resources Inc.

1630,COP,"It was a week where the price of oil spiked to its highest mark in nearly eight months. However, natural gas futures fell sharply.On the news front, integrated majors ExxonMobil Corp. (XOM  -  Free Report), Chevron Corp. (CVX  -  Free Report) and TOTAL S.A. (TOT  -  Free Report) came up with stronger-than-expected earnings reports, driven by higher oil prices.Overall, it was a mixed week for the sector. While West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures gained about 4% to close at $53.90 per barrel, natural gas prices slumped 5.6% to $2.752 per million Btu (MMBtu). (See the last ‘Oil & Gas Stock Roundup’ here: SLB & HAL's Q3, RIG's New Contract & More.)The U.S. oil benchmark rallied on expectations that OPEC and other major producers will agree to expand their output-cut deal beyond March. The agreement, already renewed once, keeps 1.8 million barrels a day off the market in an attempt to clear a supply glut.Further support came from the U.S. Energy Department's inventory release, which showed steep declines in domestic gasoline and distillate inventories on rising exports.Upbeat third-quarter U.S. GDP data and signs of recovery in global demand growth was also bullish for oil prices.Meanwhile, natural gas futures finished the week down despite a smaller-than-expected increase in supplies. Unfavorable weather forecasts and strength in the commodity’s production, induced the drop in prices.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    Energy giant ExxonMobil Corp. posted strong third-quarter 2017 results, courtesy of increased price realizations from liquids and gas and improved margins at the refinery business.Production averaged 3.878 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (MMBOE/d), marginally higher than 3.811 MMBOE/d in the year-ago quarter. Ramp up in Australian projects supported the upside.ExxonMobil’s downstream segment recorded profits of $1.5 billion, $303 million higher than the July-September quarter of 2016.

Some are being impacted by lower oil prices while others are not.Which energy companies have the best earnings charts this week?And which should you be watching for the best read on what is happening in the sector?5 Top Energy Earnings Charts 1.    Hess (HES  -  Free Report) is an E&P which gets about half of its revenue from the US and half from international. Shares have sunk near 5-year lows as the price of oil continues to be at multi-year lows. It’s coming off a miss last quarter.2.    ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report) has actually beat 3 out of the last 4 quarters which has been hard to do for the big E&P companies. But much like Hess, shares are still near multi-year lows.3.    Valero (VLO  -  Free Report) has only missed twice in the last 5 years. That’s an impressive track record for ANY company. Valero is the largest US refiner and also owns over 7,000 service stations. Shares are at new 5-year highs. Maybe energy stocks aren’t so bad after all?4.    ExxonMobil (XOM  -  Free Report) has a great track record of beating, with just 4 misses in the last 5 years. During the oil price plunge, it has gotten a boost from its petrochemical and refining divisions. Will that still hold for the rest of 2017?5.    Chevron (CVX  -  Free Report) shares are well off their 2015 lows even though it has missed more than it has beat on earnings. Still, investors have found comfort in Chevron’s large dividend, which is currently yielding 3.6% even as shares are trading near 1-year highs.Want to Learn How to Trade Options?Have you always wanted to trade stock options but are unsure where to begin or what to look for?Each week, Zacks’ Dave Bartosiak will bring you a detailed explanation of the trades “live” on YouTube.Watch him go through the trade as he answers your questions in real time.Become one of Dave’s minions.

1634,COP,"Leading exploration and production company, ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report) is set to release its third-quarter 2017 financial results before the opening bell on Oct 26.Last quarter, the company delivered an impressive 800.0% positive earnings surprise due to higher realized prices for the commodities it had sold and production ramp up on the back of numerous key developments. The company also delivered positive average earnings surprise of 134% in the last four quarters. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Which Way Are Estimates Treading?Let’s look at estimate revisions in order to get a clearer picture of analyst opinion on the stock before the earnings release.The Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased from 6 cents per share for the third quarter to 9 cents per share in the last 30 days with one firm being bearish and four firms being bullish. The estimate reflects a year-over-year improvement of about 114%.Factors Likely to Influence this QuarterThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for average sale price of natural gas is $4.09 per thousand cubic feet (Mcf), higher than last quarter’s $3.83 per Mcf and the year-ago quarter’s $2.83 per Mcf. However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for natural gas production for the third quarter has declined to 2,920 million cubic feet per day (Mmcfd) from 3,499 Mmcfd in the last quarter and 3,777 Mmcfd in the year-ago quarter.The average sales price of natural gas liquids for the third quarter is estimated to be $25.45 per barrel, higher than the reported price of last quarter’s $20.96 per barrel and $16.55 per barrel in the year-ago quarter. Production is expected to fall to 102 thousand barrel per day (MBD) from second-quarter production of 127 MBD and the year-ago quarter’s production of 148 MBD.Average crude oil sales price is expected to be $48.12 per barrel, marginally lower than second quarter’s $48.16 per barrel. However, it is higher than the year-ago quarter’s price of $45. The production of crude oil per day for the third quarter is expected to fall to 571 MBD from previous quarter’s 590 MBD and the year-ago quarter’s 586 MBD.Though we expect average realized prices in the third quarter to increase for all the commodities, their production is expected to decrease. The fall in production can be primarily attributed to the company’s asset sales in 2017. These divestures include the sale of the mining operations in Foster Creek Christina Lake oil sands and Western Canada’s Deep Basin gas assets. The company also closed the divesture deals of San Juan asset and Barnett asset in the third quarter of 2017. Hence, it is difficult to conclusively predict the net impact on third-quarter results.Q3 Price PerformanceConocoPhillips has gained 13.8% in the third quarter compared with 9.1% growth of its industry.Earnings Whispers?Our proven model does not conclusively show that ConocoPhillipsis likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Unfortunately, that is not the case here as elaborated below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is -18.92% as the Most Accurate estimate stands at 8 cents while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged higher at 9 cents.Zacks Rank: ConocoPhillips has a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 and 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies that you may consider as our model shows these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Bill Barrett Corporation  is an independent exploration and production company based in Denver, CO. It has Earnings ESP of +10.90% and a Zacks Rank #2.Canadian Natural Resources Limited (CNQ  -  Free Report) is an exploration and production company. It has Earnings ESP of +7.46% and a Zacks Rank #2.Cenovus Energy Inc (CVE  -  Free Report) is an integrated oil major from Canada. The company has an Earnings ESP of +40.0% and a Zacks Rank #2.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

1635,COP,"Qatar is presently the largest exporter of liquefied natural gas (""LNG"") in the world. The country is alone responsible for 32% of global LNG exports. It also has the third largest proven reserves of natural gas of 24.5 trillion cubic meters. Moreover, cost of production of LNG in Qatar is the lowest in the world. However, there is a new contender for the top spot now, Australia. Australia is expected to overtake Qatar following the completion of its new LNG projects. Per the Department of Industry, Innovation and Science of Australia, yearly LNG export capacity of Australia is expected to reach 74 million tons by June 2019 from 63.8 million tons estimated for 2017 and 52 million tons in 2016. On the other hand, Qatar’s LNG export in 2016 was 77.6 million tons.By 2020, the $200 billion investment in the country's LNG industry is expected to push Australia to the top spot in the list of the largest LNG exporters. Australia’s LNG exports are expected to increase 41% year over year by this time period.How Will Australia Climb to the Top?Big ProjectsThe $54 billion Gorgon project deserves a mention here. It has increased Australia’s LNG production rapidly since it came online in March 2016. Energy giant Chevron Corporation (CVX  -  Free Report) is the majority shareholder (47.3%). Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM  -  Free Report) – the largest U.S. oil company by market value – and Royal Dutch Shell plc (RDS.A  -  Free Report) have a 25% stake each in the development. The remaining stake is held by Osaka Gas, Tokyo Gas and Chubu Electric Power. Notably, 15.6 million metric tons of LNG will likely be produced every year once the Gorgon project is fully completed.New projects that are supporting the country's rise include Chevron's Wheatstone LNG project in Western Australia. It started this month. The Wheatstone fields are estimated to contain over 4.5 trillion cubic feet of gas deposits.In July, Shell's flagship project, Prelude floating liquefied natural gas (FLNG) facility set sail from a South Korean shipyard toward north-west Australia where the next phase of the project will commence. Prelude will handle production, liquefaction, storage and transfer of LNG at sea. It will also be responsible for processing, export and condensate liquefied petroleum gas. The facility has a production capacity of around 5.3 million tons per annum (mtpa) of liquids, with LNG accounting for 3.6 mtpa or 68% of the total capacity. Production is likely to start in early 2018.Inpex Corp.’s Ichthys LNG off the northwestern coast of Australia is scheduled to come online in 2018. The floating production, storage and offloading facility (FPSO) vessel, Ichthys Venturer of Inpex's project has a huge capacity of 1.12 million barrels of gas condensate with 40 years of operating life. The $34 billion Inpex project is expected to tap more than 12 trillion cubic feet of natural gas reserves. It will be a milestone in the country's journey to the top.Besides these mammoth projects, others worth mentioning are ConocoPhillips’ (COP  -  Free Report) massive Australia Pacific LNG (“APLNG”) facility that started shipment of liquefied natural gas in early 2016. The APLNG facility is located on Curtis Island in Queensland, Australia. China Petroleum & Chemical Corporation (SNP  -  Free Report) also has stakes in this project.Tax StructureThe tax structure of the countries, pertaining to income from the royalties levied on the companies, is markedly different. Qatar government has levied a higher tax rate than the Australian government on LNG exports. Per IMF, the tax scenario in Qatar will help the country to receive AU$12.54 billion in royalty payments from LNG exports in 2020, from sales of AU$53.73 billion. On the other hand, by 2020, Australia’s LNG export value is expected to be around AU$40.63. However, Government of Australia’s Petroleum Resources Rent Tax (PRRT) receipts from all oil and gas production is estimated to be AU$0.8 billion, showing a huge difference in both the countries’ tax structure. This fact can attract more oil and gas majors to Australia.Geographical PositionIncreasing LNG demand in the Asian market from China, India, Japan, South Korea and other countries is benefiting Australia. Rising demand from the East Asian market can absorb and secure Australia's LNG supplies. It has made Australia the biggest rival in this market for Qatar.How is Qatar Rising to the Challenge?In July 2017, Qatar announced plans to increase its LNG production for the next decade. The energy department of the country expects the move to increase its LNG output to 100 million tons annually between 2022 and 2024.Also, Qatar enjoys a favorable geographical location. Its supplies can reach Europe and most of the Asian market at low cost. However, distance from Qatar to East Asian countries is more than that of Australia, which benefits the latter.Low cost of supply in addition to very large-scale plants and marketing operations can provide Qatar with strategic advantages over Australia. Qatar's cost of production is much lower than rival Australia, making its LNG business more profitable.Also, the export controls installed by the Australian government to fulfill domestic energy needs can act as a positive for Qatar.To ConcludeWe can say that even though Qatar is planning to increase its exports in the future, the tax friendly environment in Australia, which has already drawn several oil and gas mammoths, can make it challenging for Qatar to retain the top spot in the near future.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest Strategies It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

1636,COP,"The U.S. Energy Department's inventory release showed that crude stockpiles fell unexpectedly as refinery throughput rose. The report further revealed that gasoline inventories rose from previous week, while distillate stocks recorded a fall.The bullish impact from the surprise crude inventory draw was supported by other developments including strong Chinese data, mounting tensions between Iraq and Kurdistan near an oil-rich region, President Trump’s decision not to certify Iran’s compliance with the nuclear deal, and a falling U.S. rig count.As a result, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures gained around 4.4% for the week to settle at $51.45 per barrel Friday – the highest since Sep 29.Analysis of the EIA DataCrude Oil: The federal government’s EIA report revealed that crude inventories fell by 2.7 million barrels for the week ending Oct 6, following a decrease of 6 million barrels in the previous week. The analysts surveyed by S&P Global Platts – the leading independent commodities and energy data provider – had expected crude stocks to go down some 400,000 barrels.Improving refinery crude runs amid higher utilization rates, together with lower domestic production, led to the big stockpile draw with the world's biggest oil consumer.The rapid decline of oil inventories in recent months has helped the U.S. crude market shift from year-over-year storage surplus to a deficit. At 462.2 million barrels, current crude supplies are 2.5% below the year-ago period. However, stocks are close to the upper half of the average range during this time of the year.However, stocks at the Cushing terminal in Oklahoma – the key delivery hub for U.S. crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange – was up by 1.3 million barrels to 63.8 million barrels.The crude supply cover was down from 30.3 days in the previous week to 29.1 days. In the year-ago period, the supply cover was 29.4 days.Gasoline: Supplies of gasoline were up for the third week running following the end of the peak driving season. The 2.5 million barrels addition – contrary to the polled number of 1.4 million barrels fall in supply level – took gasoline stockpiles up to 221.4 million barrels. Despite increases over the past few weeks, the existing stock of the most widely used petroleum product remains 1.8% below the year-earlier level but is in the upper limit of the average range.Distillate: Distillate fuel supplies (including diesel and heating oil) went down by 1.5 million barrels last week, compared with analysts’ expectations for 1.6 million barrels decrease in supply level. The weekly fall could be attributed to strengthening export demand and storm-induced outages. At 134 million barrels – the lowest since June 2015 – current supplies are 14.6% below the year-ago level and are in the bottom half of the average range for this time of the year.Refinery Rates: Refinery utilization was up by 1.1% from the prior week to 89.2%. While refinery runs have rebounded from storm-induced nine-year lows, it’s still a far cry from the pre-Harvey rates of 96.6% -- the highest since 2005.About the Weekly Petroleum Status ReportThe Energy Information Administration (EIA) Petroleum Status Report, containing data of the previous week ending Friday, outlines information regarding the weekly change in petroleum inventories held and produced by the U.S., both locally and abroad.The report provides an overview of the level of reserves and their movements, thereby helping investors understand the demand/supply dynamics of petroleum products. It is an indicator of current oil prices and volatility that affect the businesses of the companies engaged in the oil and refining industry.The data from EIA generally acts as a catalyst for crude prices and affect producers, such as ExxonMobil Corp. (XOM  -  Free Report), Chevron Corp. (CVX  -  Free Report) and ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report), and refiners such as Valero Energy Corp.

1639,COP,"Midstream energy player Phillips 66 (PSX  -  Free Report) has received consent for a new share repurchase program of $3 billion from its board of directors. Since the third quarter of 2012, the company’s total authorization for share repurchases has increased to $12 billion.Phillips 66’s board of directors has also declared a regular quarterly dividend of 70 cents per common stock. The dividend is payable on Dec 1, 2017 to its shareholders of record as of the close of business on Nov 17, 2017.These announcements are in sync with the company’s strategy to enhance shareholder value. Phillips 66 has increased quarterly dividend rate seven times. Since 2012, it has returned over $15 billion to its shareholders in the form of dividends, share repurchases and share exchanges. Phillips 66 has repurchased and exchanged over 20% of outstanding shares since its formation.These actions increase the positivity that currently surrounds Phillips 66’s stock price. The company’s shares have been touching new highs. Phillips 66 is believed to have an association with the biggest North American travel center operator, Pilot Flying J, wherein Warren Buffet's Berkshire Hathatway Inc  has a stake of 38.6%. Berkshire Hathatway aims to have the majority ownership by 2023 in Pilot Flying-J.ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report) has divested 50% of its stake in the CFJ Properties, which included Flying J truck stops to Pilot Travel Centers in 2010 for $626 million. During that time, the sales agreement comprised long-term supply contract agreements with Flying-J. However, as per sources, Phillips 66 still has long-term supply agreements with Flying-J. Phillips 66’s brand name along with the old ConocoPhillips signs is still seen at some of the Flying-J Travel Centers across the country.Moreover, the company is likely to carry on with its upward trajectory as Berkshire holds considerable stakes in both companies and the supply agreements are expected to continue and expand.Shares of the company have returned 13.3% compared with the industry’s increase of 9.6% over the last three months. Zacks Rank & Key PicksCurrently, Phillips 66 carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1642,COP,"Two major Californian cities — San Francisco and Oakland — have filed lawsuits against five oil and energy super majors in late September. The cities have taken legal action against Chevron Corp. (CVX  -  Free Report), ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report), Royal Dutch Shell plc (RDS.A  -  Free Report), ExxonMobil Corp. (XOM  -  Free Report) and BP p.l.c. (BP  -  Free Report) — all Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) companies. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. The companies have been accused of causing an adverse impact on the climate, resulting in global warming. The plaintiffs hold these fossil fuel companies accountable for rising sea levels, changing landscapes, higher global temperatures and increased risk of storms and droughts.The cities are located on the opposite sides of San Francisco Bay, and the lawsuit claims that the region’s water level is already on the rise. If the companies lose the case, they will be liable to pay billions of dollars in fines.Though the lawsuits do not specify the compensation amount, updating San Francisco’s seawall alone could cost up to $5 billion. Pre-emptive damage charges for an estimated rise in sea levels of up to 10 feet by 2100 are also likely to be incurred by the companies. Flood protection initiatives in Oakland are expected to cost roughly $56 million.Officials of both cities allege that despite being aware of the adverse effects of fossil fuel on the climate, the companies continue to recklessly produce and market these products.Failed LawsuitsNotably, many such lawsuits have been filed in the past to hold individual energy companies accountable for climate change but they did not bear results.  In 2009, Kivalina — city in Alaska — filed charges against many oil companies but the case got dismissed in the court as the Clean Air Act and the Environmental Protection Agency repealed the claims of the city officials.In 2011, the Supreme Court of U.S. overruled the public nuisance claims of eight states and the New York City against the electric utility companies. In July, similar litigation cases were filed by two coastal counties of California —Marin and San Mateo — against oil majors like Chevron, BP, Shell and ExxonMobil among others for rising sea levels. The charges claimed that the companies were responsible for about 20% of greenhouse gas emissions between 1965 and 2015.The verdict is pending and there are chances that this case might also fail given the complex nature of legal requirements. Also, with the energy industry remaining impressive and President Trump’s dismissal of climate change legislation, things have become difficult for plaintiffs. Trump’s unwavering belief in deregulation as well as his denial of climate change science and desire to roll back the work of the Obama administration has been raising concerns of late.Discrepancies Between Words and ActionsWhile Chevron recognizes the effects of climate change, it doesn’t believe that such lawsuits are a solution to this grave issue. According to one company’s spokesperson: “Reducing greenhouse gas emissions is a global issue that requires global engagement and action. Should this litigation proceed, it will only serve special interests at the expense of broader policy, regulatory and economic priorities.” Thus whether the lawsuit is simply a political move to shame fossil fuel overlords or is actually a drive to a legal change remain a wait-and-see story.While companies like Chevron and ExxonMobil have started recognizing the climate change, their actions seem to tell a different story. They continue to produce and invest in fossil fuels. Both companies have opposed the cleaner environment resolutions by investors in the latest annual meet.ExxonMobil has also been accused of publicly downplaying climate change facts stated by its own scientists. Despite the pressure by the investors and the climate activists, the companies remain passive toward the adoption of cleaner practices.Per the latest Carbon Majors report, around 71% of the global emissions have been caused by just 100 companies, wherein ExxonMobil, Shell, BP and Chevron rank among the top four contributors. The report also highlighted that the contribution of fossil fuels to climate change have doubled since 1988. The report further pinpoints that global average temperature will rise by 4 degree Celsius by the end of the century if the fossil fuel extraction continues at the same rate. Only stringent regulations and their effective implementations will help in the reduction of carbon emissions in the future and facilitate effective transition to cleaner and renewable energy sources. The shift in global climate has already prompted some energy companies to adopt such measures.5 Trades Could Profit ""Big-League"" from Trump PoliciesIf the stocks above spark your interest, wait until you look into companies primed to make substantial gains from Washington's changing course.Today Zacks reveals 5 tickers that could benefit from new trends like streamlined drug approvals, tariffs, lower taxes, higher interest rates, and spending surges in defense and infrastructure.See these buy recommendations now >>

1643,COP,"The U.S. Energy Department's inventory release showed that crude stockpiles fell more than expected as exports jumped to a new record. The report further revealed that gasoline inventories rose from previous week, while distillate stocks recorded a fall. Meanwhile, refinery activity continued to rebound from post-Hurricane Harvey challenges.However, the positive effect from the hefty crude inventory draw was more than offset by the news of production resumption at Libya’s largest oil field and slipping compliance to OPEC’s output cut deal.As a result, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures lost 0.9% (or 44 cents) to settle at $49.98 per barrel Wednesday – the lowest settlement since Sep 19.Analysis of the EIA DataCrude Oil: The federal government’s EIA report revealed that crude inventories slumped by 6 million barrels for the week ending Sep 29, following a decrease of 1.8 million barrels in the previous week. The analysts surveyed by S&P Global Platts – the leading independent commodities and energy data provider – had expected crude stocks to go down some 1.5 million barrels.Soaring exports in the wake of widening Brent premium to WTI led to the big stockpile draw with the world's biggest oil consumer. A discount in U.S. oil prices to the global benchmark Brent (or a larger spread) makes domestic crude attractive in overseas markets.The rapid decline of oil inventories in recent months has helped the U.S. crude market shift from year-over-year storage surplus to a deficit. At 465 million barrels, current crude supplies are marginally below the year-ago period. However, stocks are close to the upper half of the average range during this time of the year.Meanwhile, stocks at the Cushing terminal in Oklahoma – the key delivery hub for U.S. crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange – was up by 1.5 million barrels to 62.5 million barrels.The crude supply cover was down from 31.5 days in the previous week to 30.3 days. In the year-ago period, the supply cover was 30.4 days.Gasoline: Supplies of gasoline were up for the second week running as refinery throughput decreased. The 1.6 million barrels addition – slightly above the polled number of 1.5 million barrels rise in supply level – took gasoline stockpiles up to 218.9 million barrels. Despite last week’s increase, the existing stock of the most widely used petroleum product is remains 3.7% below the year-earlier level but is in the upper limit of the average range.Distillate: Distillate fuel supplies (including diesel and heating oil) went down by 2.6 million barrels last week, compared with analysts’ expectations for 2.4 million barrels decrease in supply level. The weekly fall could be attributed to strengthening demand. At 135.4 million barrels, current supplies are 15.7% below the year-ago level but are in the top half of the average range for this time of the year.Refinery Rates: Refinery utilization was up by 5.4% from the prior week to 88.6%. While refinery runs have rebounded from storm-induced nine-year lows, it’s still a far cry from the pre-Harvey rates of 96.6% - the highest since 2005.About the Weekly Petroleum Status ReportThe Energy Information Administration (EIA) Petroleum Status Report, containing data of the previous week ending Friday, outlines information regarding the weekly change in petroleum inventories held and produced by the U.S., both locally and abroad.The report provides an overview of the level of reserves and their movements, thereby helping investors understand the demand/supply dynamics of petroleum products. It is an indicator of current oil prices and volatility that affect the businesses of the companies engaged in the oil and refining industry.The data from EIA generally acts as a catalyst for crude prices and affect producers, such as ExxonMobil Corp. (XOM  -  Free Report), Chevron Corp. (CVX  -  Free Report) and ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report), and refiners such as Valero Energy Corp. (VLO  -  Free Report), Phillips 66 (PSX  -  Free Report) and Marathon Petroleum Corp. (MPC  -  Free Report).Want to Own an Energy Stock Now?If you are looking for a near-term energy play, Lonestar Resources US Inc. (LONE  -  Free Report) may be a good selection.

1644,COP,"World's largest publicly traded oil company, ExxonMobil Corporation (XOM  -  Free Report) recently declared that since May 2017, it has increased its Permian Basin presence by 22,000 acres. The company achieved this through multiple acquisitions and acreage trades. This has added value to its existing 6 billion barrels of oil equivalent resource base located in the Permian Basin.The oil major is one of the biggest operators in the Permian Basin, the most popular unconventional basin at the moment. At present, ExxonMobil operates 19 drilling rigs in the area that include 14 horizontal well drilling rigs in the core Midland Basin. Since mid-2014, the company has drilled 200 wells in the Midland Basin area, where it has 130,000 acres. ExxonMobil has 250,000 acres in the Delaware Basin where it operates four drilling rigs.With more acreage, the company will be able to boost returns in the basin by supporting longer laterals. The complexity of development will be reduced with more acreage and potential drilling locations.Presently, 566 companies operate in the basin. ExxonMobil is rapidly increasing its presence in the region as are other leading oil companies.These include ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report), Energen Corporation (EGN  -  Free Report), Apache Corporation (APA  -  Free Report) and others. Exploration and production company, ConocoPhillips has around 1 million acres in the basin. In the last six years, the company has received 734 drilling permits. Although Birmingham, AL-based Energen owns around 150,000 acres in the basin, the number of permits gained is more than double of ExxonMobil. Texas-based Apache holds more than 2.5 million acres in the Permian Basin along with 3,300 permits received since 2012.About the CompanyIrving, TX-based ExxonMobil is engaged in oil and natural gas exploration and production, petroleum products refining and marketing, chemicals manufacture, and other energy-related businesses. Approximately 83% of ExxonMobil’s earnings come from operations outside the United States. The company divides its operations mainly into three segments: Upstream, Downstream and Chemicals.ExxonMobil is the world’s best run integrated oil company, given its track record of high return on capital. It has collaborated with Russia for exploring potential commercial reserves in the country. However, tensions between the United States and Russia might affect its efforts to generate shareholder value by exploiting Russian oil and gas reserves.Price PerformanceExxonMobil has lost 9.4% of its value year to date against the 0.6% rise witnessed by the industry it belongs to. Zacks Rank ExxonMobil carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1645,COP,"Canadian oil major Cenovus Energy Inc. (CVE  -  Free Report) recently picked cyber security provider Nozomi Networks for its strategic industrial control systems (“ICS”). Nozomi Networks will provide services in the remote upstream production sites of Cenovus.Cenovus, following a comprehensive review, has chosen Nozomi Networks for its superior know-how in ICS cyber security. To ensure efficient and uninterrupted operations at Cenovus, Nozomi Networks will provide real-time monitoring, security and analytics with the most advanced technology available. Along with ICS monitoring, the deal can bring Cenovus hybrid threat detection, process anomaly detection, industrial network visualization, asset inventory, and vulnerability assessment. Nozomi Networks has been helping global oil and gas leaders since 2013.Move RationaleThis move by Cenovus is much required in the industry as data breach is a constant threat to energy companies. The company uses SCADAguardian as the base of its ICS cyber program. The periodic enhancement of cyber security and system upgrades has assumed greater significance since 2010, when a computer worm named Stuxnet targeted SCADA systems. Stuxnet affected several oil companies including ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report) and Chevron.Moreover, in the 2011 to 2015 period, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security recorded at least 350 breach attempts at energy companies. Every month, on an average oil major ExxonMobil Corporation (XOM  -  Free Report) blocks more than 64 million emails, 139 million Internet access attempts and 133,000 other actions, which are potentially malicious.About Cenovus and Zacks RankSpun off from Encana Corp. (ECA  -  Free Report) in 2009, Cenovus is an integrated oil company headquartered in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. The company is focused on growing its oil projects and establishing natural gas and crude oil production in Alberta and Saskatchewan. Cenovus continues to work on advancing technologies to reduce the amount of water, steam, natural gas and electricity used in operations and to decrease surface land disturbance.Cenovus carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1646,COP,"Canadian oil major, Cenovus Energy Inc. (CVE  -  Free Report) recently announced that it has agreed to divest its Suffield crude oil and natural gas operations to International Petroleum Corporation. The assets are located in southern Alberta, Canada.Deal DetailsPer the deal, Cenovus will receive gross cash proceeds of C$512 million from International Petroleum. Both the companies agreed to a contingency arrangement, where International Petroleum will pay Cenovus up to C$36 million more if the U.S. oil price moves to $55 to $60 a barrel limit and U.S. gas prices rise to $3.50 to $4 per million British thermal units limit in the next two years. The deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2017.The sold assets include Cenovus's Canadian Forces Base Suffield properties and its adjacent Alderson property. Current production level from the assets is 23,700 barrels of oil equivalent a day, of which 72% is natural gas.Deal RationaleThe net proceeds from this transaction along with the proceeds from Greater Pelican Lake asset sale will enable Cenovus to reduce its $3.6 billion debt, following the acquisition of oil sands assets from ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report) earlier this year.The deal is in line with Cenovus' strategy to divest $5 billion worth of assets. Including the latest deal, the company generated $1.5 billion in divestitures.In this context, we would like investors to know that the company will sell its Palliser assets in southern Alberta and the Weyburn assets in Saskatchewan next. The deals are expected to be over in the fourth quarter of 2017. Cenovus has put Weyburn's carbon dioxide enhanced oil recovery operations up for sale.Also, we would like to remind investors that recently Cenovus agreed to divest its heavy oil properties in Pelican Lake and other eclectic assets to Canadian Natural Resources Limited (CNQ  -  Free Report) for C$975 million ($787 million) in cash.About Cenovus Spun off from Encana Corp. (ECA  -  Free Report) in 2009, Cenovus is an integrated oil company headquartered in Calgary, Alberta, Canada.

1648,COP,"It was a week where oil prices extended the streak of gains, while natural gas futures slipped following a clutch of bearish data sets.On the news front, European oil major BP plc (BP  -  Free Report) started pumping natural gas from the Khazzan field in Oman, midstream energy player Phillips 66 Partners L.P. (PSXP  -  Free Report) entered into a $2.4 billion agreement to buy Bakken assets from its parent, while Drilling powerhouse Transocean Ltd. (RIG  -  Free Report) decided to scrap six floaters, taking a $1.4 billion hit in the process. Overall, it was a mixed week for the sector. While West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures gained 1.5% to close at $50.66 per barrel, natural gas prices fell 2.2% to $2.959 per million Btu (MMBtu). (See the last ‘Oil & Gas Stock Roundup’ here: BP's Contract Renewal, SDRL's Bankruptcy, REN's Asset Sale.)The U.S. oil benchmark closed at its highest level since May 24 as traders held out hope for price stability amid an improving supply-demand narrative. Data showing the number of U.S. oil rigs dropping for a third straight week helped cement those gains.Energy bodies OPEC and IEA both recently raised global oil demand forecasts for this year, helping to tighten the market significantly. Further, the Paris-based IEA said that the global oil supply had come down by 720,000 per day last month to 97.7 million barrels on outages and maintenance in non-OPEC countries.Meanwhile, according to the OPEC’s latest monthly report, the oil cartel’s production fell by 79,000 barrels a day in August to 32.76 million as output dropped in Libya, Gabon, Venezuela and Iraq. This points to the success of the 14-member group’s output curb initiatives and rising compliance levels, which reached a record 116%.Adding to the positive momentum, OPEC and Russia claimed to be on the right track in clearing the global oil glut with half the job done.The number of active rigs drilling for crude in the U.S. – an indicator of oil industry activity – fell by five to 744 as of Friday, as per data from oilfield services firm Baker Hughes Inc.Meanwhile, an above-average increase in natural gas supplies, together with unfavorable weather forecasts and strength in the commodity’s production weighed on natural gas futures.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    Energy giant BP plc announced the commencement of natural gas production at the Khazzan field in Oman. The company will be using fracking technology, which is rarely used in the Middle East. In the field, BP holds a 60% stake, while the remaining is owned by Oman Oil Company Exploration & Production.The Khazzan gas project, estimated expected to have an inventory of 300 drilling wells, is the largest start-up for BP in 2017. Also, it is the sixth project start-up among the seven new key developments of the company this year. All the projects are likely to take the energy giant closer to its target of adding 800,000 barrels of oil equivalent every day by 2020.BP has two planned phases for the Khazzan project. The company expects the field to generate 1.5 billion cubic feet of gas after the completion of the phases. Further, the company estimates recoverable reserves from the natural gas field of around 10.5 trillion cubic feet.2.    Midstream energy player Phillips 66 Partners L.P. recently announced the signing of a deal worth $2.4 billion – with parent company Phillips 66 (PSX  -  Free Report).Slated to close by early October, the deal will allow the partnership to buy Phillips 66’s 25% stake in each of Energy Transfer Crude Oil Company, LLC and Dakota Access, LLC. It is to be noted that the remaining 75% stake in Energy Transfer Crude Oil Company and Dakota Access, LLC lies with Bakken Holdings Company, LLC.Investors should know that Dakota Access, LLC and Energy Transfer Crude Oil Company, LLC own and operate the Bakken Pipeline that includes both Dakota Access Pipeline (“DAPL”) and Energy Transfer Crude Oil Pipeline (“ETCOP”). The Bakken Pipeline spreads over 1,926 miles and has a capacity to transport 520,000 barrels of crude every day. Also per the agreement, Phillips 66 Partners is expected to purchase 100% stake in Merey Sweeny LP, which owns a coke processing plant at the Sweeny refinery of Phillips 66.This will mark the largest ever transaction for Phillips 66 Partners. The addition of pipeline assets will provide the partnership with stable fee-based revenues. This will generate lucrative cash distributions for the unit holders. Phillips 66 Partners revealed that the transaction will grow its distribution by 30% and will also help generate $1.1 billion in annual operating income by 2018.3.    Offshore driller Transocean Ltd. recently announced that it will retire six of its cold stacked floaters. The company expressed its desire to put the rigs up for sale, which can be recycled to be more environment-friendly. Following the move, Transocean is expected to incur an impairment cost of around $1.4 billion in the third quarter of 2017. Although the move may create a short-term headwind, most analysts believe that it will not affect the company in the long term.The retirement of the six deepwater floaters is in line with the company’s strategy of increasing its fleet quality. The removal of old and less competitive rigs will make way for new high-specification assets, making the company’s operations more technically capable. It will provide Transocean’s fleet a competitive advantage. Also, reactivation cost for most of the cold-stacked rigs is high and will face tough competition from the new-build rigs due to the technological gap.Transocean has four ultra-deepwater drillships under construction. Transocean’s recent purchase of Songa, a Norwegian company, may have led the company to take the step. Songa’s complementary assets and strong fleet quality will strengthen Transocean’s portfolio.4.    In a bid to transform itself into a Delaware Basin pure play U.S.-based upstream company Halcón Resources Corporation (HK  -  Free Report) recently inked a deal to offload non-operated assets in Williston Basin to a private player. These assets have a production capacity of 1,891 barrels of oil, 1,931 thousand cubic feet of gas and 65 barrels of natural gas liquids per day. Subject to regulatory approvals and satisfactory closing conditions, the deal will entitle a payment of up to $104 million to Halcón. Halcón plans to use the proceeds from the sale for reducing debt. This will strengthen the company’s balance sheet and provide it with increased liquidity to execute drilling projects.Halcón, being one of the big sufferers of the weak crude environment, filed for bankruptcy in July 2016. In September, it completed financial restructuring and emerged from bankruptcy. Since then, the company has been divesting assets in most of its basins to concentrate on the prolific Delaware play. In less than nine months, Halcón divested around 2,000 wellbores across its obsolete and non-core assets for more than $2 billion cash proceeds. In July, the company sold around 104, 000 acres in Williston Basin for $1.04 billion. In August, it closed another $6 million deal to sell the non-operating assets in Williston Basin.Since the beginning of 2017, the company has been strengthening its foothold in the Delaware Basin through acquisitions. This has enabled Halcón to increase its acreage in the region at a reasonable price and has poised it for growth. In the Delaware Basin, the company currently owns over 41,500 net acres in Ward and Pecos counties. In January, Halcón acquired over 21,000 acres in Pecos for $705 million, while divesting the El Halcón assets in the East Texas Eagle Ford for $500 million. Halcón also aimed to purchase an additional 15,040 net acres in Ward. The company bought around 594 acres in Pecos in March with a production capacity of 160 barrels of oil equivalent per day. In June, the company further increased its acreage by over 3,600 acres in Pecos. The company also expects to acquire an additional 8,320 net acres in the northern part of Ward, by Dec 31.5.    Brazilian energy behemoth Petrobras (PBR  -  Free Report) recently announced senior notes offering worth $2 billion. The offering will be made in two tranches.The first tranche of the notes offering, with an interest rate of 5.3%, will raise $1 billion and is scheduled to mature in 2025. The second part worth $1billion carries an interest rate of 6% and is slated to mature in 2028. Petrobras intends to use the proceeds from the offering for the repayment of borrowings under its senior credit facility and for general corporate purposes.The company has also offered holders additional notes maturing between 2019 and 2021, with the option to either repurchase their debt or exchange it with longer dated securities. The move will help the company to trim its outstanding debt load and extend the long-term maturities of securities.Currently, Petrobras is concentrating on improving its liquidity and operational performance. The company’s efforts to deleverage or at least refinance its debt obligations to extend its maturity are working in its favor. The company’s divestment goals will help to reinstate its financial health by mitigating the leverage.Price Performance The following table shows the price movement of some the major oil and gas players over the past week and during the last 6 months.CompanyLast Week Last 6 MonthsXOM-0.2%-0.3%CVX+2.5%+9.3%COP+7.1%+13.3%OXY+2.2%+2.8%SLB+1.6%-9.5%RIG+1.1%-18.2%VLO+6.2%+14.2%ANDV+2.4%+31.1%The Energy Select Sector SPDR – a popular way to track energy companies –  generated a +1% return last week.

1649,COP,"Investors in ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report) need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Sep 22, 2017 $44.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for ConocoPhillips shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, ConocoPhillips is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Oil and Gas - Integrated - United States industry that ranks in the Top 37% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, two analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while four have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from a loss of 6 cents per share to a loss of 4 cents in that period.Given the way analysts feel about ConocoPhillips right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options? Each week, our very own Dave Bartosiak gives his top options trades.

1650,COP,"The U.S. Energy Department's inventory release showed that crude stockpiles recorded a large build, triggered by nine-year low refinery activity following last month’s Hurricane Harvey. Moreover, with almost a quarter of the nation’s fuel processing capacity shut down in the immediate aftermath of the catastrophe, product inventories (gasoline and distillate) fell sharply.While the data sets were neither overly optimistic or pessimistic fundamentally and much of what came out of the report was anyways expected, bullish commentary regarding world demand catapulted crude above $50 a barrel for the first time since Jul 31 yesterday.Eventually, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures gained 1.2% (or 59 cents) to settle at $49.89 per barrel Thursday.Improving Supply-Demand NarrativeEnergy bodies OPEC and IEA both recently raised global oil demand forecasts for this year, helping to tighten the market significantly.Further, the Paris-based IEA said that the global oil supply had come down by 720,000 per day last month to 97.7 million barrels on outages and maintenance in non-OPEC countries.  Meanwhile, according to the OPEC’s latest monthly report, the oil cartel’s production fell by 79,000 barrels a day in August to 32.76 million as output dropped in Libya, Gabon, Venezuela and Iraq. This points to the success of the 14-member group’s output curb initiatives and rising compliance levels.Adding to the positive momentum, OPEC and fellow exporters are said to be open to extending their production cut agreement beyond its March expiry.Analysis of the EIA DataCrude Oil: The federal government’s EIA report revealed that crude inventories jumped by 5.9 million barrels for the week ending Sep 8, following an increase of 4.6 million barrels in the previous week. The analysts surveyed by S&P Global Platts – the leading independent commodities and energy data provider – had expected crude stocks to go up some 10.1 million barrels.Lower refinery throughput due to lingering Hurricane Harvey effects on Gulf Coast units, together with volume ramp-up from the production facilities shuttered in the wake of the storm, led to the big stockpile build with the world's biggest oil consumer. Nevertheless, the build was significantly below forecasts.At 468.2 million barrels, current crude supplies are down 2.5% from the year-ago period but are in the upper half of the average range during this time of the year.Meanwhile, stocks at the Cushing terminal in Oklahoma – the key delivery hub for U.S. crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange – was up by 1 million barrels to 59.1 million barrels.The crude supply cover was up from 27.5 days in the previous week to 29.4 days. In the year-ago period, the supply cover was 30.5 days.Gasoline: Supplies of gasoline were down for the second week running as Gulf Coast refineries continued to be sidelined by damage from Hurricane Harvey. The massive 8.4 million barrels draw – way above the polled number of 4 million barrels and the largest since at least 1990 – took gasoline stockpiles down to 218.3 million barrels. Following last week’s slide, the existing stock of the most widely used petroleum product has fallen 4.4% below the year-earlier level but is in the upper limit of the average range.Distillate: Distillate fuel supplies (including diesel and heating oil) went down by 3.2 million barrels last week, compared with analysts’ expectations for 300,000 barrels decrease in supply level. The second successive weekly fall could be attributed to plunging production, which reached a seven-year low of 3,973 thousand barrels per day on storm-induced outages. At 144.6 million barrels, current supplies are 11.2% below the year-ago level but are in the middle of the average range for this time of the year.Refinery Rates: Refinery utilization was down by 2% from the prior week to 77.7%. – the lowest since 2008 – as the facilities continue to recover from the impact of Harvey.About the Weekly Petroleum Status ReportThe Energy Information Administration (EIA) Petroleum Status Report, containing data of the previous week ending Friday, outlines information regarding the weekly change in petroleum inventories held and produced by the U.S., both locally and abroad.The report provides an overview of the level of reserves and their movements, thereby helping investors understand the demand/supply dynamics of petroleum products. It is an indicator of current oil prices and volatility that affect the businesses of the companies engaged in the oil and refining industry.The data from EIA generally acts as a catalyst for crude prices and affect producers, such as ExxonMobil Corp. (XOM  -  Free Report), Chevron Corp. (CVX  -  Free Report) and ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report), and refiners such as Valero Energy Corp.

1651,COP,"Upstream player ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report) has fully recovered from the after effects of tropical storm Harvey and production from its Eagle Ford field has been restored to previous level of about 130 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (MBOED).Earlier the company had forecasted production for third quarter and full-year 2017 in the range of 1,170-1,210 MBOED and 1,340-1,370 MBOED, respectively. These projections, which exclude Libya and reflect expected impacts from the San Juan, Barnett and Panhandle dispositions, remain unaltered.About Harvey and its ImpactTouted to be the most powerful hurricane that has hit Texas in five decades, Harvey dropped 50 inches of rain, setting a state record.Tropical Storm Harvey has caused large-scale flooding along the U.S. Gulf coast, crippling Houston and its port. This has resulted in the shutdown of numerous refineries and the scene is unlikely to change in the next few weeks or even months. Notably, Texas is home to 5.6 million barrels of refining capacity per day while Louisiana has 3.3 million barrels. In addition to catastrophic flooding, the Category 4 storm ravaged properties and caused widespread damage to various industries.About the CompanyConocoPhillips is a major global exploration and production (E&P) company with operations and activities in 21 countries that include the United States, Canada, the U.K., Norway, China, Australia, offshore Timor-Leste, Indonesia, Libya, Nigeria, Algeria, Russia and Qatar.

1652,COP,"The Norwegian Continental Shelf, an oil rich area, recently witnessed a surge in applications for new acreages. The Norwegian Ministry of Petroleum and Energy received applications from 39 oil companies, the highest since the Awards in Predefined Areas (“APA”) commenced in 2003.The number of applications is around 20% more than the previous highest in 2014 and almost 50% more than last year. It shows that exploration and production companies believe that the oil market, which is still crawling out of the low oil price environment and looking for stability, will recover in due course. About APANorway's annual licensing round, APA, gives companies permission to work on the matured areas of the Norwegian Continental Shelf. It was introduced to increase efficiency in exploration. In the areas under APA licensing scheme, mostly small sized discoveries of oil are expected, which makes independent development inefficient. Through effective resource and capital management, APA helps companies to profit from these discoveries. With more geological knowledge, the area under APA has increased over the years.Major Companies Companies that sought permission to work on the matured Norwegian Continental Shelf include ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report), Eni S.p.A. (E  -  Free Report), ExxonMobil Corp. (XOM  -  Free Report), Repsol, S.A. (REPYY  -  Free Report), Statoil ASA , Suncor Energy Inc. (SU  -  Free Report) and Total S.A. (TOT  -  Free Report). For some of the companies on the list, this will be their first Norwegian venture.Statoil being a Norwegian company, with the government being a major shareholder, has an advantage over its competitors. The company currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.This year, the Norweigan government has extended the area under APA in both the Norwegian Sea and the Barents Sea. This has increased the possibility of finding oil and attracted more companies. The APA-2017 includes 34 Norwegian Sea blocks and 53 Barents Sea blocks. The authority will announce name of the companies eligible for production licenses in early 2018. Norway's BenefitThe increase in the number of applications shows that oil exploration and production in the Norwegian Continental Shelf is attractive even in a low oil price environment. The government of Norway believes this will play a vital part in the country's employment scenario and boost revenues in the coming years. It also proves that the government’s petroleum policy, which focused on oil related improvements in the country, has worked pretty well so far.  More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

1653,COP,"Even as the U.S. is recovering from the flooding and devastation caused by the powerful Hurricane Harvey, an even bigger storm is brewing in the Atlantic Ocean. The potentially catastrophic Hurricane Irma has been accorded a rare Category 5 status -- the highest possible designation for a hurricane. It is already battering the Caribbean with extreme rain and winds and is set to strike Florida sometime Sunday after moving through Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic and Haiti. One of the strongest Atlantic storms on record, Irma is likely to be worse than Harvey.Harvey’s Impact on Energy PricesAs Hurricane Harvey tore through the Texas Gulf Coast, workers in the U.S. oil industry struggled to evacuate production facilities and shut down refineries. This, in turn, triggered the biggest disruption in nationwide energy supplies in years.The United States has major refining infrastructures along the Gulf of Mexico (“GoM”). According to the EIA, more than 45% of domestic oil refining capacity are located in the GoM.With deluge and floods in the aftermath of Harvey knocking out a major chunk of domestic refining capacity, crude demand was significantly curbed. This led to lower oil prices.However, in terms of price action, gasoline was the market mover. The most widely used petroleum product ended more than 13% higher last week to $1.748 a gallon in the aftermath of Harvey knocking out refining operations in the Houston area. Harvey caused weeks of disruptions at facilities in its path -- shutting units, sparking fires and creating supply shortage possibly extending for months.Oil, Gasoline Limp Back to NormalcyProduction and refining infrastructure that was shut down in the wake of Hurricane Harvey is starting to come back online.While Saudi-owned Port Arthur refinery – America’s largest – is on its way up and should be partly operational by early next week, other refining giants like Valero Energy Corp. (VLO  -  Free Report) and ExxonMobil Corp. (XOM  -  Free Report) are also making progress in restarting their units. In fact, eight facilities constituting more than 11% of domestic refining capacity are beginning procedures to restart, a process that has boosted demand for crude and catapulted the commodity to four-week highs. Meanwhile, with refining capacity starting to ramp up, gasoline futures are sliding.  Oil producers along the Gulf of Mexico and Eagle Ford shale also continue to claw back to pre-Harvey levels amid inspections and damage assessments. Companies including ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report), Devon Energy Corp. and EOG Resources Inc. have all resumed drilling operations and hopes to bring major portion of their affected production online soon.Irma Unlikely to Cause Major Energy Upheaval in the U.S.Compared to Harvey, the effects of Irma on the energy sector is expected to be much lighter. This is because Florida hardly has any critical supply-side assets – downstream or upstream – and therefore the U.S. refining capacity and production will be barely hit. With virtually no impact on supply, the only casualty is likely to be oil demand in the U.S. Southeast, that too for a limited period.However, certain traders believe that the superstorm – ranked in the top five most powerful Atlantic hurricanes in the last 80 years and coming just after Harvey – could take out a major domestic demand center leading to renewed fuel shortages.Some Caribbean Facilities at RiskWhile most of the U.S. energy industry will remain unscathed, some facilities in the storm’s immediate path stands to be affected by Irma.   Midstream operator Buckeye Partners L.P.’s (BPL  -  Free Report) petroleum products storage terminal in Bahamas – the largest such facility in the Western Hemisphere with a capacity of 26 million barrels – is set to be affected by Irma. Houston-based Buckeye Partners is also the operator of marine terminals close to Miami, Tampa, and Jacksonville, FL., with all of them likely to take minor hits. The Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) partnership’s Yabucoa oil terminal in Puerto Rico is likely to get impacted as well. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.If forecast models hold true, U.S. companies such as Chevron Corp. (CVX  -  Free Report), ExxonMobil Corp., Marathon Petroleum Corp. (MPC  -  Free Report) and Targa Resources Inc. (TRGP  -  Free Report) could face minor operational hiccups. These firms operate terminals or pipelines in Florida’s Port Everglades petroleum storage hub.One Simple Trading IdeaSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.

1654,COP,"Canadian oil major, Cenovus Energy Inc. (CVE  -  Free Report) recently agreed to divest its heavy oil properties in Pelican Lake and other eclectic assets to Canadian Natural Resources Limited (CNQ  -  Free Report) for C$975 million ($787 million) in cash, putting earlier speculation to rest. The deal is expected to be over by Sep 30, 2017.Asset DetailsProduction of heavy oil in the Cenovus' Pelican Lake assets began in 1997 through horizontal wells. Polymer mixed water is used here to boost the production process and increase efficiency without causing damage to the environment.The concerned assets currently produce 19,600 barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) heavy oil per day in northern Alberta, where price per flowing BOE a day is C$49,800.  First-half operating profit from the Pelican Lake assets is estimated at C$74 million.Cenovus' wholly owned Pelican Lake property is located approximately 300 kilometers north of Edmonton. In this context, we would like to remind investors that Canadian Natural has its crude oil producing property near the oil project of Cenovus in Pelican Lake. Also, this is Canadian Natural’s second domestic acquisition this year after the buyout of the Athabasca oil sands from energy major Marathon Oil Corporation (MRO  -  Free Report).Deal RationaleThe deal is in line with Cenovus' strategy of divesting C$5 billion to back up the C$16.8 billion acquisition of Foster Creek Christina Lake assets from ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report) in March 2017. The company plans to use the cash to partially pay down the $3.6 billion bridge loan facility that was part of the ConocoPhillips deal.Investors should also know that with the deal, the first of the four key asset sales, the company plans to bring down its net debt to operating earnings ratio below 2 by 2019.Properties ready for divestiture include Suffield shallow-gas assets in southeastern Alberta, Palliser in Alberta, Weyburn in Saskatchewan. These three properties have the capacity to produce a total of 85,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. The Suffield gas assets can bring Cenovus around C$600 million. However, there are apprehensions that the sale of these properties may not bring the company the C$5 billion that it seeks. In that case, the company can divest its other non-core assets.The deal will enable the company to optimize its asset portfolio as well as strengthen its balance sheet following the Foster Creek Christina Lake acquisition.Effect of the Deal on Stock Price                                                     As soon as speculation of the deal surfaced, it reversed the downward movement of the stock. It has gained almost 13% in the past seven days. The company is aggressively pursuing its divestiture plan and this can push share prices higher in the coming days.  About Cenovus and Zacks RankCenovus is an integrated oil company headquartered in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. The company remains focused on growing its oil projects and establishing natural gas and crude oil production in Alberta and Saskatchewan. Cenovus continues to work on advancing technologies to reduce the amount of water, steam, natural gas and electricity used in operations and to decrease surface land disturbance.Cenovus presently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1655,COP,"Per Bloomberg, oil producer Canadian Natural Resources Limited (CNQ  -  Free Report) might be the one to acquire Cenovus Energy Inc.'s (CVE  -  Free Report) asset in Pelican Lake, Alberta, Canada. Canadian Natural will pay C$1 billion ($807 million) for the property.Canadian Natural and Cona Resources Ltd. were among the major bidders for the oil project in Northern Alberta near Fort McMurray. The asset in focus uses polymer flooding technology to increase oil recovery. The technology helps Cenovus to mix water and polymer, which is used to extract oil efficiently.  The company is divesting Pelican Lake properties to reduce its debt related to the C$16.8 billion acquisition of Foster Creek Christina Lake assets from ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report) in May 2017.Asset DetailsCenovus' wholly owned Pelican Lake property is approximately 300 kilometers north of Edmonton. Production of heavy oil in the asset began in 1997 through horizontal wells. The polymers boost the production process and increase efficiency without causing damage to the environment.Oil production from the Pelican Lake assets at present is 20,100 barrels per day. Operating cost in the world class property is below $12 per barrel.Importance of the Deal to Canadian NaturalThe Canadian oil exploration and production company has its crude oil producing property near the oil project of Cenovus in Pelican Lake. The company has experience in operating heavy oil and polymer based property. Hence, the deal will provide Canadian Natural a strategic advantage and an edge over competitors.Canadian Natural also aims to focus on creating a diversified portfolio of light, primary heavy, Pelican Lake oil and natural gas liquids.

1658,COP,"As Hurricane Harvey tore through the Texas Gulf Coast--the devastating storm just made landfall again, this time in Louisiana--workers in the U.S. oil industry have struggled to evacuate production facilities and shut down refineries. This, in turn, triggered the biggest disruption in nationwide energy supplies in years, driving gasoline prices higher at the pumps.The tropical cyclone led to heavy downpour which surpassed the all-time rainfall in Texas, according to the National Weather Service.The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (GS  -  Free Report) has estimated property damages in the range of $30 billion to $40 billion. In fact, the U.S. investment bank predicts third-quarter GDP growth to fall by 0.2%.Oil Refineries Face the BruntThe United States has major refining infrastructures along the Gulf of Mexico (GoM). According to The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), more than 45% of domestic oil refining capacity and around 51% of the nation’s natural gas processing capacity are located in the GoM. Super major Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM  -  Free Report) has shut down the 584,000 barrels of oil per day Baytown refinery – touted to be the second largest in the domestic market.Anglo Dutch energy giant Royal Dutch Shell plc (RDS.A  -  Free Report) has stopped refining activities at the Deer Park unit that has the capacity to process 325,700 barrels of oil daily. Three facilities of the largest U.S. refiner Valero Energy Corporation (VLO  -  Free Report) – Port Arthur, Three Rivers and Corpus Christi – have been affected by the storm as well.Another downstream player Marathon Petroleum Corporation (MPC  -  Free Report) is operating its Galveston Bay refinery at reduced rates.As per consulting firm WTRG Economics, the shutting down of leading gulf coast refineries translated into a daily loss of around 2 million barrels of production – mostly gasoline and diesel. Crude Output Remains Relatively UnaffectedPer the EIA, the GoM area accounts for just about 17% of total domestic crude production and 5% of total natural gas output. This is in stark contrast to a decade ago when 30% of the domestic oil volume came from the GoM region.This is mainly due to the spectacular boom in U.S. shale production. Arguably the biggest development in the global oil market over the last few years, the relentless increase in the low-cost North American shale output has taken the limelight away from the GoM. To maintain deepwater/ultra-deepwater drilling in the GoM – with its associated risks and steep costs – oil prices need to be much higher than the current level.Hence, the majority of domestic oil and natural gas production comes from shale resources. Per data provided by the EIA, roughly 48% of the domestic oil output has been generated from tight oil plays in 2016. Moreover, the U.S. produced 60% of natural gas from shale resources like Marcellus and Utica in 2016.As a result, the loss from GoM oil and gas output following Harvey is far less than that incurred in 2005, when hurricanes like Katrina and Rita had hit the region. As per the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement, almost 19% of the GoM volume, which represents 331,370 barrels of crude per day, was lost thanks to Harvey. This is significantly lower than the combined loss of 1.5 million barrels a day almost 12 years ago, according to WTRG Economics.Among the few explorers that have been forced to cease operations following heavy winds and rains are Chesapeake Energy (CHK  -  Free Report) and Denbury Resources Inc. (DNR  -  Free Report). In the Eagle Ford area of Texas, Chesapeake has decided to close drilling work of two new wells. Additionally, Denbury temporarily suspended its operations at its Houston area fields. Both Chesapeake and Denbury carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.On August 25, ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report) decided to stop all activities in the Eagle Ford shale region of Southern Texas. Now, the upstream player is restarting some of its Eagle Ford wells.How Did Commodity Prices React?While oil companies are in a hurry to assess damages to refineries and offshore platforms in the wake of the tropical storm, the near-term impact to prices vary.The decline in refinery operations from the temporary closure of the units led gasoline prices to jump to beyond a two-year high of $1.783 a gallon on anticipated supply outages.On the other hand, with the expectation of lower crude demand due to major refinery shut downs, oil dropped to a one-month low of $46.57 a barrel on August 28. The commodity lost further ground the following day, closing at $46.44 a barrel.Meanwhile, natural gas was down slightly on concerns of lower power and manufacturing sector demand due to temporary electricity outages. 4 Surprising Tech Stocks to Keep an Eye On Tech stocks have been a major force behind the market’s record highs, but picking the best ones to buy can be tough.

1659,COP,"Statoil ASA  along with partners has confirmedgas volume, which is small and non-commercial in the Korpfjell well in the southeast Barents Sea.Located between Norway and Russia, Korpfjell represents the first exploration well that has been drilled in the formerly disputed region.The main aim behind the drilling operations in the large geological structure in Korpfjell was to establish whether any oil was present. However, small gas volumeshaveonly been established through drilling. The gas discovery is projected to contain recoverable resources of 40-75 million barrels of oil equivalents or 6-12 billion standard cubic meters of gas.Proven in the well’s main target, the gas volume does not qualify for a commercial development. Statoil and its license partners will now beginevaluating the acquired well data.In 2018, Statoil intends both participation in partner-operated wells andoperated wells in the Barents Sea southeast area. Drilling of a second commitment well in the Korpfjell license PL 859 is also a part of the aforesaid plans.Among the Barents Sea wells included in the 2017 exploration campaign of Statoil, Korpfjell represents the fourth well that has been drilled. The first being the Kayak oil discovery announced on Jul3, followed by the Blåmann gas discovery on Jul17 and Gemini North on Aug 7. The drilling of the first four wells was performed in a secure and efficient manner, without any serious injuries.The semi-submersible drilling rig Songa Enabler was used to drill the Korpfjell well. The rig will now be transferred to the Koigen Central prospect in license PL718 in the western part of the Barents Sea once the well has been permanently closed and discarded.Statoil, the operator of Korpfjell (PL859) owns 30%. Other partners include Chevron Corporation (CVX  -  Free Report), Petoro, Lundin Norway and ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report) holding 20%, 20%, 15% and 15%, respectively.Statoil has vast operations in the Norwegian Continental Shelf (NCS). Although, the current drilling did not meet expectations, we believe that Statoil is well positioned to sustain its steady production growth over the next few years on the back of its large resource base at NCS. The company’s constant effort to grow its resource base and enhance shareholder value can be seen by the positivity in its price chart.Year to date,shares of Statoil have gained 2.4% compared with the industry’s decrease of 6.2%.Zacks Rank & Stock PicksCurrently, Statoil carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1660,COP,"In a low oil price environment, oil companies looking for options to reduce the cost of production and cope up with oil price volatility. For this reason, many of the U.S. oil companies have left the Canadian oil sands and moved to the Permian Basin where production cost is lower.Apart from the Permian Basin, there are five other major oil producing regions in the United States, which are covered by EIA in its monthly Drilling Productivity Report. These include Appalachia, Bakken, Eagle Ford, Haynesville and Niobrara.However there is growing interest in another shale play located to the north of Permian Basin. It has witnessed a brisk increase in investment and drilling activity recently, which has prompted the EIA to include the region in its monthly Drilling Productivity Report. The growing presence of shale players in the Anadarko region may have led to its inclusion. The region incorporates 24 Oklahoma and five Texas counties.Production Related DetailsIn terms of production, the Anadarko region generated 447,000 barrels of oil and 5,979 million cubic feet of gas per day in August 2017. Moreover, the region is becoming popular due to surging natural gas production and the trend is expected to continue in the coming month.The month over month data shows that the region is likely to register an increase in oil and gas production, for September 2017, by 12,000 barrels and 78 million cubic feet per day, respectively.Why the Shift?The interest in Anadarko region – incorporates one of the most prolific natural gas reserves in North America – can be attributed to the rising opportunity of using upgraded drilling and completion technology.Another factor that is increasing the focus on Anadarko is rising lease operating expenses in the Permian Basin. There is also a shortage of oilfield services and occasional production hiccups from time to time in the Permian Basin. Investors should know that 129 rigs, as of July, were actively engaged in drilling activities in Anadarko basin, which were less than 373 active rigs in the crowded Permian Basin.The Anadarko region includes the STACK (Sooner Trend Anadarko Basin Canadian and Kingfisher Counties) and the SCOOP (South Central Oklahoma Oil Province) plays. These two areas have witnessed an increase in investment from exploration and production companies in the recent years.Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (APC  -  Free Report), SandRidge Energy, Inc. , Continental Resources, Inc. (CLR  -  Free Report), Newfield Exploration Company (NFX  -  Free Report), Apache Corporation (APA  -  Free Report), and ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report) are among the oil companies operating in the basin.

1661,COP,"Per Norway’s industry regulator, ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report) has finally been given the consent to prepare for the removal of the first permanent oil platform built off Norway more than four decades ago.In July, the company had applied for removal of Ekofisk 2/4 H, Ekofisk 2/4 A, Ekofisk 2/4 FTP, and Ekofisk 2/4 Q platforms. Ekofisk 2/4 A began yielding oil from the North Sea in 1974 and was permanently shut in 2013.Per the regulator, the company received approval for parts of the work that comprises initial preparatory works, installation of a temporary crane on Ekofisk 2/4 field terminal platform (FTP) and commencement of the removal of minor structures.The remainder of ConocoPhillips’ consent application will be dealt separately by the Norwegian Petroleum Safety Authority (PSA).In April, Offshore Energy Today reported that ConocoPhillips was set to award a contract for the removal of Ekofisk field platforms to Heerema Marine Contractors (HMC).At the time, AF Gruppen, stated that it received notice that ConocoPhillips Skandinavia AS planned to enter into a contract with HMC for the removal and disposal of platforms associated with the Ekofisk field. AF Gruppen is one of the largest civil engineering and construction companies in Norway and a key subcontractor to HMC.The contract comprised engineering, preparation, removal & disposal (EPRD) of four platforms with a total tonnage of about 36,000 tons. The removal is part of ConocoPhillips’ Ekofisk I Cessation plan which should begin in 2017 and end in 2022.Discovered in 1969, Ekofisk field was brought online in 1971 from the Gulftide jack-up rig, a temporary installation standing on removable legs, which was later replaced by permanently fixed production platforms in 1974.Despite the removal of field’s oldest installations, new equipment was set up and production is ongoing. The field is expected to continue producing oil until 2050.ConocoPhillips intends to begin preparations in the fourth quarter of this year.ConocoPhillips, the operator of Ekofisk, has a stake of 35%. Other partners include Total SA (TOT  -  Free Report), Eni SpA (E  -  Free Report), Statoil ASA  and Norwegian state-owned Petoro, holding 39.6%, 12.4%, 8% and 5%, respectively.In the last three months, shares of ConocoPhillips have lost 9.5% compared with the industry’s decline of 9.1%.ConocoPhillips currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1663,COP,"Brazilian state-run integrated energy company Petróleo Brasileiro S.A. or Petrobras (PBR  -  Free Report) recently discovered oil accumulated in the pre-salt layer of Campos Basin in the Marlim Sul field area offshore Brazil.About the DiscoveryThis is the company's first commercial oil find in Marlim Sul’s pre-salt layer. At a depth of 4,568 meters, Petrobras hit a new accumulation while drilling a well commonly known as Poraquê Alto, located 115 kilometers east of the state of Rio de Janeiro. The company verified the finding with the help of profile data, gas detector, formation testing by cable, and fluid samples. Per Petrobras' analysis, there is presence of good porosity and permeability features in the carbonate reservoirs along with oil at a depth of 4,420 meters. The company expects the oil reservoir to be 45 meters thick. Aftermath of the DiscoveryWe would like investors to know that in the last few years, the company's production from the Campos Basin decreased consistently. Hence, the discovery will help Petrobras to increase the production level again in the region. The company expects more discoveries in the matured basin, aided by the production infrastructure that the company has already deployed.The latest discovery will help Petrobras with its strategy of opening new exploratory frontiers and intensifying pre-salt development. The will commence from 2020. The company continues to focus on the pre-salt layer due to its lower lifting cost of less than $7 per barrel.With this latest find, Petrobras joins the list of oil discoveries made by big companies like CoconoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report) and Repsol SA (REPYY  -  Free Report). ConocoPhillips reported a huge oil discovery in Alaska in Jan 2017 and said that the company will split the working interest of the discovery with Anadarko Petroleum Corp. (APC  -  Free Report). In Mar 2017, Repsol also discovered oil onshore Alaska.About the CompanyPetrobras is the largest Latin American oil and gas integrated company. It is involved in the exploration, production, refining, retailing and transportation of petroleum and its byproducts, both domestically and internationally. The company, headquartered in Rio de Janeiro,dominates Brazil’s oil and gas sector. It produces most of Brazil’s crude oil and natural gas and accounts for almost the entire refining capacity of the country.Price PerformancePetrobras has lost 22.3% of its value in the last six months compared with 13.3% loss of its industry.Zacks' 10-Minute Stock-Picking SecretSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.

1664,COP,"The global oil sector has come a long way since it witnessed a sudden slump. Related industries, as well as their constituent companies, faced the impact of low oil prices. Some companies even had to file for bankruptcy, as staying in the business became harder with their then-available sources. Thousands of jobs vanished from the industry. The demand for products in the oil industry is something that takes a long time to change. Therefore, price rise due to increasing demand was something farfetched. The next available option was to cut back supply and generate a little scarcity, which would be enough to bring oil prices to a bearable level for the companies. Oil cartels like the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) had to cut back supply.Upstream companies were forced to drop their contracts with drilling service providers, forcing them to cold stack their rigs. The process again killed some jobs. To survive the crash, most of the companies went for cost reduction options like improving production technologies, exiting from unprofitable sites and merger and acquisition.Improved Production TechnologiesFor the short term, to maintain cash flow, companies have been resorting to cost cuts through several techniques. Apart from the layoffs, instead of drilling one well at a time, oil producers like Statoil ASA  have been using rigs that can move on tracks or legs to complete drilling of several wells at a time. Not only does this reduce the time for drilling but also increases efficiency. As a result, operating costs also decline.Companies have also been using new fiber-optic sensors below the ground to receive data, which allows them to make informed decisions. With the help of the sensors, the oil upstream companies get to know the optimum depth of hard rock penetration as well as the required well spacing in the region. The fibers also help in keeping a track of temperatures, pressure and vibration on equipment underground, which helps companies to pull out before potential damages.Large companies are shifting from diesel to natural gas coming from the same field to power operations. This reduces cost per well in a field. The whole oil turmoil has brought in these new efficiency measures in the industry to lower expenses.Exit from Unprofitable Sites Oil companies have been looking for reserves where extraction and production processes are cheap. They are selling high maintenance assets and shifting toward lower production costs plays. In this context, we can mention the mass exodus from the Canadian oil market to the Permian Basin to avail low extraction and production costs.Oil companies like ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report), Statoil, Royal Dutch Shell plc (RDS.A  -  Free Report), ExxonMobil Corp. (XOM  -  Free Report), Marathon Oil Corp. (MRO  -  Free Report) and others are leading the way. This is pushing the companies quickly toward stable balance sheets. Oil companies are discovering new oil reserves but choosing to operate on those whose production cost is less. Shell presently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1665,COP,"The U.S. Energy Department's inventory release showed that crude stockpiles recorded a sharp decline for the sixth week in a row on record high refinery runs. With oil supplies continuing to fall, investor sentiment has turned slightly positive on dissipating fears about a meltdown to sub-$40 levels. Analysts also believe that the trend, if sustained, could help tighten the market significantly.However, gains were capped by a strong dollar and escalating tensions between the US and North Korea that sparked investor movement away from riskier assets to safe havens like gold. As a result, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures added 0.8% (or 39 cents) to $49.56 per barrel Wednesday.Analysis of the EIA DataCrude Oil: The federal government’s EIA report revealed that crude inventories fell by 6.45 million barrels for the week ending August 4, 2017, following a decline of 1.53 million barrels in the previous week.The analysts surveyed by S&P Global Platts – the leading independent commodities and energy data provider – had expected crude stocks to go down some 2.5 million barrels. A surge in refinery crude runs to 12-year highs and dip in imports as well as domestic production led to the large stockpile draw with the world's biggest oil consume.The sixteenth inventory reduction in 18 weeks has helped the U.S. crude market shift from year-over-year storage surplus to a deficit. Nevertheless, U.S. still remains awash with excess oil. At 475.44 million barrels, current crude supplies are in the upper half of the average range during this time of the year.After declining in 15 of the last 16 weeks, stocks at the Cushing terminal in Oklahoma – the key delivery hub for U.S. crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange – was up 569,000 barrels from previous week’s level to 56.37 million barrels.The crude supply cover was down from 27.9 days in the previous week to 27.4 days. In the year-ago period, the supply cover was 31.3 days.Gasoline: Supplies of gasoline were up for the first time in 8 weeks as demand weakened in the face of increasing imports and production. The 3.42 million barrels addition – contrary to the polled number of 1.25 million barrels fall in supply level – took gasoline stockpiles up to 231.10 million barrels. Despite last week’s increase, the existing stock of the most widely used petroleum product remains 1.8% below the year-earlier level but is in the upper half of the average range.Distillate: Distillate fuel supplies (including diesel and heating oil) went down by 1.73 million barrels last week, well ahead of analysts’ expectations for 600,000 barrels decrease in supply level. The fourth successive weekly fall could be attributed to strong demand and lower imports. At 147.69 million barrels, current supplies are 2.3% below the year-ago level but are in the upper limit of the average range for this time of the year.Refinery Rates: Refinery utilization was up by 0.9% from the prior week to 96.3%.About the Weekly Petroleum Status ReportThe Energy Information Administration (EIA) Petroleum Status Report, containing data of the previous week ending Friday, outlines information regarding the weekly change in petroleum inventories held and produced by the U.S., both locally and abroad.The report provides an overview of the level of reserves and their movements, thereby helping investors understand the demand/supply dynamics of petroleum products. It is an indicator of current oil prices and volatility that affect the businesses of the companies engaged in the oil and refining industry.The data from EIA generally acts as a catalyst for crude prices and affect producers, such as ExxonMobil Corp. (XOM  -  Free Report), Chevron Corp. (CVX  -  Free Report) and ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report), and refiners such as Valero Energy Corp.

1666,COP,"ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report) is appraising an offer from Alaska's Department of Natural Resources that would facilitate it to develop an existing North Slope oil field into an area in the vicinity of big discoveries.The offer is subject to the company agreeing to the development steps that incorporates drilling of a well by next June and making a payment of $7 million to the state. The payment is intended to restore revenue that Alaska might have made had it auctioned the Tofkat area in a competitive lease sale. The state has discarded plans of holding a lease sell as it would unnecessarily delay the entire process. The state is desperately trying to close a deficit of $2.5 billion.Following months of discussions between the company and the state over drilling rights on the Tofkat area, ConocoPhillips was offered to add acreage to its Colville River unit.However, if ConocoPhillips accepts the state’s terms but is unable to complete drilling in time, it might lose the Tofkat area leases. The area includes about 9,000 acres, located a few miles northeast of Nuiqsut village and extending south from ConocoPhillips' existing Colville River Unit.Per sources, the primary aim is to get the area into production in a secure way so the state can collect a royalty portion of the oil produced.ConocoPhillips holds acres in various prolific plays, of which the ones in Eagle Ford shale and Permian basin are noteworthy as they are rich in oil. The company is now focusing on these resources and has added more rigs in the play compared with 2016. Here, we need to mention that there are significant opportunities left for the company in the Eagle Ford shale where it owns about 3,500 undrilled locations that could lend access to almost 2.4 billion barrels of oil equivalent estimated potential reserves.Shares of ConocoPhillips have declined 3.7% in the last three months, while the industry declined 3.6% in the same time span.ConocoPhillips currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

(WPX  -  Free Report) reported a loss of 14 cents per share in the second quarter of 2017, narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 16 cents. The quarterly figure was also narrower than the year-ago quarter’s loss of 28 cents.Total Revenue WPX Energy’s quarterly revenues of $413 million surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $300 million by 37.7%. Further, total revenue jumped 199.3% from $138 million in the year-ago quarter.  The year-over-year increase in total revenue was due to higher realized average prices and production volumes.Oil and NGL sales of $249 million accounted for 86% of the company’s second-quarter total product revenues of $289 million.WPX Energy, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  WPX Energy, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | WPX Energy, Inc. Quote Highlights of the Release Total production in the second quarter was 106,200 barrels per oil equivalent (boe) per day, up 25% year over year. Total liquids accounted for 68% of the total production, reflecting the company’s increasing focus on oil.Oil production was 58,600 barrels per day, nearly 43.0% higher than the year-ago quarter level of 40,900 barrels per day.Total expenses were $344 million, down 21.3% from $437 million in the year-ago quarter.Interest expenses in the reported quarter were $46 million, down 13.2% from $53 million in the prior-year quarter.Realized Prices & Hedges Realized oil prices in the quarter were $42.46 per barrel, up 10.6% from the year-ago quarter. Realized natural gas prices were $2.13 per thousand cubic feet (Mcf), up 73.2%. Realized prices for natural gas liquids were up 63.1% to $18.28 per barrel.For the rest of 2017, the company has 50,750 barrels per day of oil hedged at a weighted average price of $50.26 per barrel. Further, WPX Energy has 170,000 million British thermal unit (MMBtu) per day of natural gas hedged at a weighted average price of $3.02 per MMBtu.For 2018, WPX Energy has 55,500 barrels per day of oil hedged at a weighted average price of $52.69 per barrel. The company also has 185,000 MMBtu per day of natural gas hedged at a weighted average price of $2.98 per MMBtu.Financial Update WPX Energy had $8 million of cash and cash equivalents as of Jun 30, 2017 compared with $496 million at the end of 2016. Long-term debt as of Jun 30, 2017 was $2,601 million, up marginally from 2016 end levels of $2,575 million. Net cash from operating activities in the first half of 2017 was $142 million compared with $89 million in the same period a year ago. Capital expenditure in the first half was $542 million compared with $291 million in the year-ago period. GuidanceWPX Energy has raised its capital budget of 2017 to $990–$1070 million from $905–$985 million. More than half of the capital is targeted for development in the Delaware Basin.The company raised its 2017 total production to 105–116 thousand barrel of oil equivalents per day (MBoe/d) from 103–113 MBoe/d.  Moreover, it raised its 2017 oil production to 57–60 thousand barrels per day (Mbbl/d) from 52–56 Mbbl/d. The company raised its 2017 oil volumes growth expectation to 40% from 30% from 2016 levels.Our ViewWPX Energy's second-quarter performance was better than expected due to strong production from its oil assets and recovery in the commodity prices from the year-ago level. However, a sequential drop in the realized prices of the commodities was noticed, reflecting the ongoing uncertainty in the oil and energy markets.The company continues to work on its strategy of increasing oil production, which is evident from the rising liquid mix in total production. Production from the Delaware Basin increased substantially during the second quarter with the help of assets the company acquired during the first quarter.We believe WPX Energy's exposure in the Delaware, Williston and San Juan basins will enable it to achieve its new goal of 40% higher oil generation in 2017 from 2016 levels.The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1670,COP,"It was a week where oil prices moved closer to the $50-a-barrel mark but natural gas ended slightly lower.On the news front, integrated majors Royal Dutch Shell plc (RDS.A  -  Free Report) and Chevron Corp. (CVX  -  Free Report) came up with stronger-than-expected earnings reports, but the world's largest publicly traded oil producer, ExxonMobil Corp. (XOM  -  Free Report), fell short of estimates.Overall, it was a mixed week for the sector. While West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures soared 8.6% to close at $49.71 per barrel, natural gas prices edged down 0.7% to $2.941 per million Btu (MMBtu).Notching up some of the year’s strongest gains, oil prices were bolstered by the U.S. Energy Department's inventory release that showed a sharp decline in crude stockpiles for the fourth week in a row. Importantly, the massive 7.2 million barrels drawdown – a sign of market rebalancing – was accompanied by draws in gasoline and distillate inventories.It’s this comprehensive decline in oil and product inventories the energy traders have been waiting to see all this while. Investors were also encouraged by Saudi Arabia’s pledge of deeper cuts to its crude exports.Meanwhile, natural gas turned marginally lower amid worries over the fuel’s tepid demand on the back of bearish weather predictions and a steady increase in production.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    Energy giant ExxonMobil Corp. posted an earnings miss in second-quarter 2017 owing to a decline in liquid volumes and lower margin from chemical businesses. This was partially offset by increased price realizations from liquids and gas and improved refinery volumes.Production averaged 3.922 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (MMBOE/d), almost in line with the year-ago quarter. However, liquid output fell 3% year over year to 2.269 million barrels per day, owing to field decline.During the quarter, ExxonMobil generated cash flow of $7.1 billion from operations and asset sales. The company returned $3.3 billion to shareholders through dividends. Capital and exploration spending decreased 24% year over year to $3.9 billion. (Read more: Exxon Mobil Q2 Earnings Miss on Lower Volumes.)2.    Europe’s largest oil company Royal Dutch Shell plc reported strong second-quarter results, as its upstream business swung to a profit on rebounding oil prices and refining operations remained robust amid successful cost containment efforts.Upstream segment recorded a profit of $339 million (excluding items) during the quarter, turning around from the $1,325 million (adjusted) loss in the year-ago period. Shell’s upstream volumes averaged 2,672 thousand oil-equivalent barrels per day (MBOE/d), 2% higher than the year-ago period. Shell’s worldwide realized liquids prices were 16% above the year-earlier levels while natural gas prices were up 31%.During the quarter under review, Shell generated cash flow from operations of $11,285 million – the most since the oil price plunge started three years ago – returned $3,900 million to shareholders through dividends and spent $6,766 million on capital projects. The company’s resilient cash generation has helped it to cover dividend payments. Importantly, the group raked in $12,157 million in free cash flow during the second quarter, as against a loss of $3,158 million a year ago. (Read more: Shell's Q2 Earnings Soar as Cost Cuts Pay Off.)3.    Smaller rival Chevron Corp. reported strong second-quarter results amid the recovery in commodity prices, production gains and the success of its cost savings initiatives. The company reported earnings per share (excluding special items) of 91 cents, higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 89 cents and the year-ago profit of 48 cents.Chevron’s total production of crude oil and natural gas increased 10% compared with last year’s corresponding period to 2,780 thousand oil-equivalent barrels per day (MBOE/d). The U.S. output increased 3% year over year to 701 MBOE/d, while the company’s international operations (accounting for 75% of the total) was up 13% to 2,079 MBOE/d.Exploration costs fell from $214 million in the second quarter of 2016 to $125 million. The second-largest U.S. oil company by market value after ExxonMobil spent $4,538 million in capital expenditures during the quarter, a considerable decline from the $5,523 million incurred a year ago.Importantly, Chevron delivered a good cash flow performance this quarter – an important gauge for the oil and gas industry – with $5,036 million in cash flow from operations, up from $2,531 million a year ago. (Read more: Chevron Q2 Earnings Beat on Oil Rally, Output Rise.)4.    Upstream energy player ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report) reported second-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of 14 cents per share that compared favorably with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 2 cents and year-ago-quarter loss of 79 cents. Higher realized prices from commodities sold primarily led to the strong Q2 numbers.Average realized price for oil was $48.16 per barrel, compared with $42.72 in the year-earlier quarter. Natural gas liquids were sold at $20.99 a barrel versus $16.55 a year ago. The price of natural gas was $3.83 per thousand cubic feet, compared with $2.49 in second-quarter 2016.Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) ConocoPhillips' third-quarter 2017 production guidance is pegged at the range of 1,170–1,210 MBOED, excluding production from Libya. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Weak oil and gas pricing scenario compelled the company to slash 2017 capital budget from the earlier projection of $5 billion to $4.8 billion. (Read more: ConocoPhillips Posts Earnings in Q2, Cuts Capex View.)5.    Ohio-based independent oil refiner and marketer Marathon Petroleum Corp. (MPC  -  Free Report) reported marginally weaker-than-expected second-quarter earnings on lower gross margins and elevated costs. The company’s earnings per share (adjusted for special items) came in at $1.03, a penny below the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Operating income from the Refining & Marketing segment – which is the main contributor to Marathon Petroleum earnings – was $562 million compared with $1,025 million in the year-ago quarter. The deterioration reflects narrower gross margin.Marathon Petroleum reported expenses of $17,326 million in second-quarter 2017, 12% higher than $15,475 million in the year-ago quarter.Prior to the earnings release, Marathon Petroleum also announced that its board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 40 cents a share, an 11% increase over the current quarterly dividend of 36 cents a share. The dividend will be paid to stockholders of record on Sep 11 and paid on Aug 16.

1671,COP,"Upstream energy player ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report) reported second-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of 14 cents per share that compared favorably with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 2 cents and year-ago-quarter loss of 79 cents.Revenues of $8,882 million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6,735 million. The top line also improved from $5,575 million in the year-ago quarter.  Higher realized prices from commodities sold primarily led to the strong Q2 numbers. Production ramp up from numerous key developments also supported the numbers.Exploration and ProductionProduction from continuing operations averaged 1,437 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (MBOED) in the quarter, as compared with 1,546 MBOED in the year-ago quarter. The decline was led by field decline, which was negated partially by production ramp up from numerous key developments.Price RealizationAverage realized price for oil was $48.16 per barrel, compared with $42.72 in the year-earlier quarter. Natural gas liquids were sold at $20.99 a barrel versus $16.55 a year ago. The price of natural gas was $3.83 per thousand cubic feet, compared with $2.49 in second-quarter 2016.    FinancialsAs of Jun 30, 2017, the company had total cash and cash equivalents of $7.5 billion and debt of $23.5 billion, with a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 43%.

The company spent $1 billion as capital expenditures and investments and paid dividends worth $331 million.Total ExpenseThe company reported expenses of $13.2 billion in the second quarter, as compared with $7.2 billion in the April-June quarter of 2016.Q2 Share PerformanceThe company’s price chart has shown considerable weakness through the quarter.

It seems that ConocoPhillips is following the likes of Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (APC  -  Free Report) and Hess Corporation (HES  -  Free Report) in this regard.Zacks Rank & Key PickConocoPhillips currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

1673,COP,"We are entering the heart of the Q2 earnings season, with more than 50% S&P 500 members expected to come out with results by the end of this week.Picture Emerging Thus FarWe now have Q2 results from 97 S&P 500 members that combined account for 28.1% of the index’s total market capitalization. According to the latest Earnings Trends, total earnings for these companies are up 8.4% from the same period last year on 5.1% higher revenues, with 78.4% positive earnings surprises and 72.2% beating revenue estimates.At this stage, we don’t have too many results from the ‘Energy’ sector. However, a number of companies have earnings lined up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.Energy: First-Half RecapLast year, 'Energy' was the strongest S&P sector performer, with a market-thumping 24% return. In particular, November's historic OPEC-led production cut deal to alleviate a supply glut managed to buoy oil prices and stabilize them around the psychologically important $50 per barrel threshold. The commodity was on a stellar run on optimism surrounding the agreement, and the outlook for oil stocks was getting better.The seemingly positive developments encouraged investors to bet on firming prices for 2017 with the oil industry finally hoping that 'this would be the year.' True to the strong sentiments, U.S. oil prices reached around $55 per barrel in late February, the highest level in 19 months.However, the situation is drastically different now, with the commodity having floundered in recent weeks. By Jun 21, crude had cratered more than 20% from its February highs and officially plunged into bear territory. In fact, prices ended down 14.3% for the first half of the year – the worst performance since 1998.Let's take a look at how oil and gas prices behaved during the second quarter of this year.Strong Q2 Earnings Growth PredictionA look back at the Q1 earnings season reflects that the overall results of the Oil/Energy sector were spectacular, driving the aggregate growth picture for the S&P 500 index.The Jan-Mar 2017 period turned out to be a rather good one with both oil and natural gas prices benefiting from easier comparison figures from the year-ago period. While crude slumped to some 12-year low in the first quarter of 2016, natural gas futures dropped to its worst level in almost 17 years.As a result, the sector – whose year-earlier comparison was to an aggregate loss – came out swinging. For the sector components on the S&P 500 index, total Q1 earnings had robust year-over-year dollar growth on 33.8% higher revenues. While 69.7% of the companies were successful in beating earnings estimates, 63.6% of them outperformed the topline.The picture looks rather encouraging for the upcoming Q2 earnings season as well. This is not surprising, considering that oil and gas are both averaging higher compared to the second quarter of 2016 when the energy companies reported unusually low bottom-line. While earnings for the Oil/Energy sector are set to jump a massive 271.4% – the highest year-over-year growth among all sectors – the top-line is likely to show a growth of 15.1% from the second quarter 2016 levels.Stocks to Watch for Earnings on Jul 27Let’s see what’s in store for six energy companies expected to come up with Jun quarter numbers on Thursday, Jul 27.Contract drilling services provider Helmerich & Payne Inc. (HP  -  Free Report) is expected to report before the opening bell.In the previous quarter, this Tulsa, OK-headquartered provider of drilling rigs, equipment and personnel to explore for and develop oil and gas missed estimates, weighed down by lower drilling activity, especially in the international markets.Regarding earnings surprises, Helmerich & Payne is on a bit of a slippery surface, having missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four reports. And our model indicates that the company is unlikely to beat on earnings this time around too.This is because, as per our proven model, a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to beat earnings. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.For the quarter to be reported, Helmerich & Payne has an Earnings ESP of -6.45%, while it carries a Zacks Rank #3. Though a Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP, a negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult. (Read more: Helmerich & Payne's Q3 Earnings: What's in the Cards?)Simultaneously, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Helmerich & Payne, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Helmerich & Payne, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Helmerich & Payne, Inc. QuoteHeadquartered in Houston, TX, National Oilwell Varco Inc. (NOV  -  Free Report) is another energy company set to report second-quarter 2017 results – this time after market closing. The company – which is one of the biggest manufacturers of drilling equipment – has a good track of having outperformed estimates in three of the last four quarters.However, National Oilwell is likely to break the trend in the to-be-reported quarter. This is because the company is a Zacks Rank #4 stock that has an Earnings ESP of -14.29%.National Oilwell Varco, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  National Oilwell Varco, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | National Oilwell Varco, Inc. QuoteThen there is Pittsburgh, PA-based integrated energy company EQT Corp. (EQT  -  Free Report) coming out with Apr-Jun operational results before the opening bell.As far as earnings surprises are concerned, EQT – an Appalachia-focused natural gas firm with primary focus on production and midstream operations – has a decent record, having missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate just once in the last four reports. However, with an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and a Zacks Rank #3, our proven model shows that an earnings beat is uncertain for EQT in the upcoming quarterly release.

(MPC  -  Free Report) reporting second-quarter 2017 results tomorrow - again ahead of the opening bell. Coming to the earnings surprise history, this Findlay, OH-headquartered downstream operator has a good record: it’s gone passed estimates in three of the last four quarters, resulting in an average positive surprise of 189.75%.But our model does not indicate that the company is likely to beat on earnings this time around, as it has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. While a Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP, the company’s ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.

(VLO  -  Free Report) is the fifth company to come out with quarterly numbers tomorrow morning.Boasting of an excellent track of having outperformed estimates in each of the last four quarters, Valero Energy is likely to encounter a speed breaker in the upcoming release. This is because the combination of Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of -1.85% makes it an unlikely candidate for earnings beat.

1674,COP,"ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report), an upstream energy firm, will release second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 27, before the opening bell.Last quarter, ConocoPhillips posted a negative earnings surprise of 300.00%. The average earnings surprise for the trailing four quarters is also a negative 72.87%. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.   Past Quarter FlashbackAlthough long-term debt has been noticeably declined in first-quarter 2017, the same has escalated manifold since the beginning of 2014. Also, after rising throughout 2016, cash & equivalents are clearly headed south.Also, the commodity pricing scenario did not show improvement in the second quarter. Oil and gas prices have been low for almost three years now and the prices slipped further during second-quarter 2017. The prolonged weakness can be attributed to a persistent supply glut in the commodity market.During the April-to-June quarter of this year, oil and natural gas prices fell 8.4% and 5%, respectively. Hence, the OPEC’s historical production cut extension deal until Mar 2018 has failed to drive oil. Natural gas is also an oversupplied commodity as is reflected by its inventory level of 2.816 tcf – as of Jun 23 – almost 7% higher than the five-year average mark (as per The U.S. Energy Information Administration).On top of that, ConocoPhillips’ expectation of Q2 production range of 1,495–1,535 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (MBOED) is lower than 1,546 MBOED produced during second-quarter 2016.We can say that weaker oil and gas prices and lower projected production level could hurt the explorer’s numbers in the second quarter.Q2 Price PerformanceDuring the April-to-June quarter of this year ConocoPhillips lost 11.9% as compared to the 16.9% fall of its industry.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that ConocoPhillips is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen.
