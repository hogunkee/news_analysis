0,ANDV,"Electric utility firm Southern Company (SO  -  Free Report) is set to release third-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Nov 1.In the preceding three-month period, the Atlanta, GA-based service provider delivered better-than-expected earnings courtesy of Southern Company Gas’ robust performance (acquired in July 2016). Southern Company delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 0.86% in the last four quarters.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement. Factors to ConsiderThe utility sector is capital intensive. These companies need huge capital to set up generation facilities, and transmission and distribution infrastructure. They also require considerable funds to maintain and upgrade the existing systems in order to meet emission-control standards. As such, we are concerned of the company’s high leverage which restricts its financial flexibility. The company currently carries a debt-to-capitalization ratio of around 63%. The increased spending of the company is also posing problems to its liquidity metrics. Last quarter, Southern Company’s operating expenses were higher by around 18.3%. If the trend persists, the company’s earnings are expected to get hurt.Prolonged delays and cost overrun issues over the company’s two major construction projects — Vogtle and Kemper — are likely to adversely affect Southern Company’s results this earnings season. The Vogtle project is being bankrolled with more than $8 billion in federal loans and loan guarantees, which is likely to deteriorate the company’s credit metrics. Additionally, the increasing capital intensity of operations may result in reduced returns. The Kemper project is also facing much criticism, with its cost ballooning over $7.3 billion from an earlier estimated figure of $3 billion in 2010. Project management problems have pushed the plant three years behind schedule already.Further, with tepid customer growth, sales are likely to get affected. As it is, the company’s sales during the last few years have declined due to the impact of fluctuating weather conditions on overall consumer demand. Last quarter, commercial, residential and industrial sales of Southern Company were down by 0.8%, 2.9% and 0.8%, respectively year over year. The trend is likely to linger in the near term.Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 earnings for the current quarter has been revised downward by 4.4% over the last seven days.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Southern Company is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is -0.23%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP FilterZacks Rank: Southern Company presently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Please note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Strong Sell) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.Stocks with Favorable CombinationThough an earnings beat looks uncertain for Southern Company, here are some firms from the energy space you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post earnings beat:Noble Midstream Partners LP (NBLX  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +10.48% and sports a Zacks Rank #1.

1,ANDV,"Energy explorer Marathon Oil Corporation (MRO  -  Free Report) is set to release third-quarter 2017 results after the closing bell on Nov 1.In the last quarter, the Houston, TX-based company reported a wider-than-expected loss on lower production from the U.S. land markets. However, Marathon Oil has topped estimates in three out of the last four quarters with an average beat of 1.57%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Which Way are Estimates Treading?Let’s look at the estimate revisions in order to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company before earnings release.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 for loss for the current quarter has been revised downward by 13.33% over the last 30 days. Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 for loss has also moved south by 10.42% over the last 30 days.Factors to ConsiderMarathon Oil’s strong inventory of development projects poise it for growth in the coming years. The company has been improving the quality of assets and is well positioned to augur production.Optimizing its core Bakken and Oklahoma programs, Marathon Oil expects its 2017 production to grow by approximately 7% with U.S. resource play output increasing by 23-27%. The recent oil sands mining divestiture and Permian acquisitions are expected to boost the company’s prospects.Marathon Oil recently stated that its third-quarter 2017 average production for sale from the United States will be toward the high end of its guidance despite Hurricane Harvey’s impact. It had guided production of around 230,000-240,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day (BOE/d).The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarterly output is pegged at 237,000 BOE/d, higher than the 222,000 BOE/d reported in the prior quarter. The company foresees its global E&P operations, excluding Libya, to produce 345,000-360,000 net BOE/d. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total sales volume stands at 372,000 BOE/d as against 357,000 BOE/d in second-quarter 2017.However, the persistent weakness in the commodity price environment is likely weigh on Marathon Oil’s cash flows and revenues. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for average realized gas price in the international markets is pegged at 52 cents per thousand cubic feet (Mcf), lower than the prior quarter figure of 57 cents. The crude price realization in the international markets is estimated at $41.61 per barrel, lower than the $47.04 per barrel recorded in second-quarter 2017. Even for the North American segment, The Zacks Consensus Estimate for crude price realization is pegged at $44.24 per barrel, lower than the $45.81 per barrel in the prior quarter. Lower price realizations may put the company’s earnings under pressure.Further, 2017 capex budget of $2.2 billion doubles 2016’s level of spending. This might also hurt the near term financials of the company.Price performance in Q3During the quarter, Marathon Oil rallied more than 14% outperforming the broader industry’s 9% gain.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Marathon Oil is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is -11.54%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate stands at a loss of 15 cents, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at a loss of 13 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Marathon Oil presently carries a Zacks Rank #3. Though a favorable Zacks Rank increases the predictive power of ESP, a negative ESP makes the surprise prediction difficult. Conversely, we caution against Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks with Favorable CombinationThough an earnings beat looks uncertain for Marathon Oil, here are some firms from the energy space you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post earnings beat:Noble Midstream Partners LP (NBLX  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +10.48% and sports a Zacks Rank #1.

2,ANDV,"Oil giant BP plc (BP  -  Free Report) is expected to report third-quarter 2017 earnings on Oct 31, before the opening bell.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 90.91%. In the last four quarters, the company’s average earnings surprise was a positive 32.39%. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.  Which Way are Estimates Treading?Let’s look at the estimate revisions in order to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company before earnings release.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of 43 cents for the third quarter has been stable in the last thirty days. It reflects year-over-year growth of 41.67%. BP p.l.c. Price and EPS Surprise  BP p.l.c. Price and EPS Surprise | BP p.l.c. QuoteFactors to Consider This Past QuarterRecently, BP has appraised its exploration portfolio. Therein, the company reiterated that it is refocusing on growth in natural gas and advantaged oil in regions where it presently functions. The company is also seeking prospects to develop new production regions while abandoning less competitive exploration deposits. These initiatives are likely to support the company with growing and sustainable free cashflows, which it can distribute among shareholders. This is likely to impact BP’s quarterly results.As compared with the year-earlier quarter, pricing environment for both oil and natural has improved. This should prove favorable for the company’s upstream business as the commodities produced could be sold at higher prices.BP projects flat sequential production and refining margin. Hence, both upstream and downstream operations look favorable. However, maintenance works and seasonal turnaround activities may limit the upside.Q3 Price PerformanceBP’s shares have returned 10.9% in the third quarter, compared with the 9.5% increase of its industry.What Our Model IndicatesOur proven model shows that BP is likely to beat on earnings this time because it has the right combination of two key ingredients.  Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is +12.94%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at 48 cents, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is at 43 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: BP currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Note that stocks with Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating on earnings. The combination of Phillip 66’s favorable Zacks Rank and Earnings ESP makes us confident about an earnings beat.Conversely, Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are some firms that you may want to consider on the basis of our model. These have the right combination of elements to beat earnings this quarter.Noble Midstream Partners LP (NBLX  -  Free Report), headquartered in Houston, TX, has diversified energy infrastructure properties.

Moreover, SCANAhas an average positive earnings surprise of 5.25% for the last four quarters.    Which Way Are Estimates Treading?Let’s take a look at the estimate revisions in order to get a clear picture of analyst opinion on the stock before the earnings release.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of $1.14 for the third quarter has been stable in the last seven days. The estimate reflects a year-over-year decline of 13.4%.Factors Likely to Influence EarningsSince 2015, the company’s long-term debt load has increased substantially. Also, during the first half of 2017, SCANA’s cash balance has declined drastically, reflecting balance sheet weakness. The company’s high debt level and overall business risks associated with the nuclear generation construction project are a major concern.Moreover, the company’s free cash flow has been negative since 2015, reflecting persistently weak operations. We are also concerned about the company’s rising operating expenses since the beginning of 2017.  Price Performance in Q3During the quarter, the company lost 27.6%, underperforming its industry’s gain of 2.7%.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that SCANA will beat estimates this quarter.

4,ANDV,"Oil giant ExxonMobil Corporation (XOM  -  Free Report) is set to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 27, before the opening bell.Last quarter, the company posted a negative earnings surprise of 6.02%. However, ExxonMobildelivered an average positive earnings surprise of 8.94% for the last four quarters.  Which Way Are the Estimates Headed?Let’s take a look at the estimate revision trend in order to get a clear picture of analyst opinion on the stock before the earnings release.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of 87 cents for third-quarter earnings has been revised upward over the last 30 days, with three firms being bullish and one firm taking a bearish stance. The consensus estimate reflects a year-over-year improvement of about 38.5%.Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $63,916 million for the third quarter, up 9% from the year-ago quarter.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that ExxonMobil is likely to beat earnings because it has the right combination of two key ingredients.   Zacks ESP: ExxonMobil’s Earnings ESP is +1.78%. A favorable ESP serves as a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.     Zacks Rank: ExxonMobil currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 has a significantly higher chance of beating earnings estimates.Conversely, Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.The combination of ExxonMobil’s Zacks Rank #3 and +1.78% ESP makes us reasonably optimistic of an earnings beat.What’s Driving the Better-than-Expected Earnings?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings after tax from ExxonMobil’s non-U.S upstream operations stands at $1,874 million, higher than $1,367 million reported in the prior quarter and $1,097 million in the year-ago quarter.Also, for upstream operations in the domestic region, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for after-tax loss stands at $159 million, significantly narrower than the loss of $183 million and $477 million reported in the preceding quarter and year-ago quarter, respectively.Investors should know that the Zacks Consensus Estimate for oil and natural gas liquid production outside the United States stands at 2,346 thousand barrels per day (mbd), higher than 2,269 mbd and 2,211 mbd in second-quarter 2017 and third-quarter 2016, respectively.Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for oil and natural gas liquid production in the United States is pegged at 513 mbd, considerably higher than 484 mbd recorded in third-quarter 2016.Hence, higher expected production amid favorable oil pricing scenario should support the company’s upstream business.Q3 Price OutperformanceDuring the quarter, ExxonMobil has rallied 1.6%, underperforming the industry’s 9.6% gain.   Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are some other companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Noble Midstream Partners LP (NBLX  -  Free Report), headquartered in Houston, TX, has diversified energy infrastructure properties.

5,ANDV,"Independent energy firm, Southwestern Energy Company (SWN  -  Free Report), is set to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 26, after the closing bell.Last quarter, the company delivered earnings of 8 cents per share that lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 16 cents. Notably, the company incurred a loss of 9 cents in the year-ago quarter. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.   Southwestern Energy Company Price and EPS Surprise  Southwestern Energy Company Price and EPS Surprise | Southwestern Energy Company QuoteWhich Way are Estimates Treading?Let’s look at the estimate revisions in order to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company before earnings release.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of 8 cents for the third quarter has seen one upward revision and one downward revision by firms in the last seven days. It reflects year-over-year growth of about 172.2%.Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $755.9 million for the impending quarter, up 16.11% from the year-ago quarter.Factors to Consider this QuarterSouthwestern Energy has a diversified reserve base in multiple U.S. basins and remains focused on investments in high-return areas such as Fayetteville, Appalachia and other new ventures. Moreover, the company maintains a competitive cost structure, which contributes to steady growth and returns throughout the business cycle. These benefits are expected to be reflected in the third-quarter results.Southwestern Energy invested heavily in the development of the fertile Marcellus play, where it held leases for approximately 337,300 net acres. Subsequently, the company increased its acreage in the Marcellus Shale in Pennsylvania by acquiring stakes from other stakeholders. We can expect significant output from those prolific plays in the coming days to increase the company’s profit, a part of which is expected to be reflected in this quarter as well.Despite these positives, Southwestern Energy’s shares have underperformed the industry in the last three months. During the aforesaid period, shares of the company have returned 0.5% compared with the industry's growth of 5.1%.Southwestern Energy’s high-debt level raises concerns. It had a debt equity ratio of 276%, while the broader industry average was 95.1%. The company’s high leverage is a cause of concern.Analysts polled by Zacks expect average gas price to fall over 9% from the preceding quarter to $2.13 per million cubic feet. The decline in the gas prices will adversely impact energy players like Southwestern Energy.Earnings WhispersOur proven model shows that Southwestern Energy is likely to beat on earnings this time because it has the right combination of two key ingredients.  Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is +4.76%.

6,ANDV,"Leading refining player Phillips 66 (PSX  -  Free Report) is expected to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 27, before market opens.The company has an impressive earnings surprise history. Phillips 66 beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 433.14%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.     Phillips 66 Price and EPS Surprise  Phillips 66 Price and EPS Surprise | Phillips 66 QuoteWhich Way are Estimates Treading?Let’s look at the estimate revisions in order to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company before earnings release.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.60 for the third quarter has seen one upward revision and one downward revision by firms in the last seven days. It reflects year-over-year growth of 52.4%.Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $2,994 million for the impending quarter, up 35.8% from the year-ago quarter.Earnings WhispersOur proven model shows that Phillips 66 is likely to beat on earnings this time around, as it has the right combination of the two key ingredients.  Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is +2.43%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at $1.64, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is at $1.60.

Note that stocks with Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating on earnings. The combination of Phillip 66’s favorable Zacks Rank and Earnings ESP makes us confident about an earnings beat.Conversely, Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.Factors Likely to Influence EarningsThe company has plans to allocate money for more profitable business units like Midstream and Chemicals instead of extensive refining and marketing operations. Midstream business is in high demand in the central United States, due to increasing requirement for fresh pipeline and infrastructure properties in the flourishing shales. Moreover, improving petrochemical demand should call for more chemical business in the United States. Such decisions reflect the company’s efficiency, which would be reflected in current quarter’s operations.We appreciate the company’s decision to invest $1.3 billion out of the total 2017 capital budget of $2.3 billion in growth projects.However, the company’s free cash flow has been negative over the last two years, reflecting weak business operations. Hence, its ability to pay dividends is at risk. Since the beginning of 2012, there has been exponential increase in long-term debt, reflecting Phillips 66’s weak balance sheet.Q3 Stock Price PerformanceDuring the reporting quarter, pricing chart reveals that Phillips 66’s shares have outperformed the industry. During the aforesaid period, the company’s shares have returned 10.7% compared with the industry’s 10.5% increase.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are some firms that you may want to consider on the basis of our model.

7,ANDV,"Ensco plc (ESV  -  Free Report), a leading supplier of offshore contract drilling services to the oil and gas industry, is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 26, before the opening bell.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 16.67%. Moreover, Ensco delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 63.91% over the last four quarters.Which Way Are Estimates Treading?Let’s take a look at the estimate revisions in order to get a clear picture of analyst opinion on the stock before the earnings release.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 16 cents for the third quarter has widened from a loss of 15 cents over the last 30 days, with two firms revising downward. The consensus estimate reflects a year-over-year decline of about 163.3%.Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $454 million for the third quarter, down 17.2% from the year-ago quarter.Factors to ConsiderThe count of rig exploring for oil and natural gas during the third quarter fell from 952 to 940, per a report of oilfield services player Baker Hughes, a GE company (BHGE  -  Free Report). Lower rig operations in the U.S. resources reflect reduced activities of drillers, Ensco being no exception.Also, eroding cash balance since 2017 is a matter of concern. Since 2015, there has been a substantial decline in net cash flow from the company’s operations. This is reflecting the company’s persistent weak operations amid volatile commodity pricing scenario. Price Performance in Q3During the quarter, the company has rallied 15.7%, outperforming the industry’s 8% gain. Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Ensco is likely to beat earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

8,ANDV,"Upstream energy player, Hess Corporation (HES  -  Free Report) is expected to report third-quarter 2017 earnings on Oct 25.Last quarter, the company delivered a negativeearnings surprise of 10.61%. However, Hess delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 2.60% for the last four quarters. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to the announcement. Hess Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Hess Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Hess Corporation QuoteWhich Way are Estimates Treading?Let’s look at the estimate revisions in order to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company before earnings release.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $1.29 for the third quarter has seen five upward revisions and two downward revisions by firms in the last thirty days. It reflects a year-over-year decline of about 15.2% from the year-ago quarter.Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $1,284 million for the impending quarter, up7.4% from the year-ago quarter.Factors to ConsiderHess is among the leading producers of crude in the Bakken oil shale play in North Dakota. The company has interests in the best areas of the play. With crude prices improving after OPEC decided to curb output, we believe that Bakken play should contribute to the company’s production growth in the long run. Moreover, new output from Gulf of Mexico and Malaysia could add considerably to the company’s output. These are likely to be reflected in this quarter’s results.Analysts polled by Zacks expect average realized oil price to rise 1% from the preceding quarter to $48.86 per barrel. The positivity in the oil prices will benefit upstream players like Hess.However, since the beginning of 2014, long-term debt load has been on the rise. Our proprietary model shows that from 2014 to 2016, the company’s long-term debt increased from nearly $5,500 million to almost $6,700 million.Also, net cash flow from operations has been declining steadily over the last three years, reflecting weak operations owing to persisting low commodity prices.  Price Performance in Q3During the quarter, Hess has underperformed the industry. The stock has gained 6.9% compared with the industry's growth of 9.1%.Earnings WhispersOur proven model shows that Hess is likely to beat on earnings this time because it has the right combination of two key ingredients.  Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is +1.52%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate of a loss of $1.27 comes below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $1.29. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Hess carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating on earnings. The combination of Hess’ favorable Zacks Rank and Earnings ESP makes us confident about an earnings beat.Conversely, Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.Stocks to ConsiderHere are other firms that you may want to consider on the basis of our model.

Moreover, Valero surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 18.24%.Which Way Are the Estimates Headed?Let’s take a look at the estimate revisions in order to get a clear picture of analyst opinion on the stock before the earnings release.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.84 for third-quarter earnings has been revised upward over the last 30 days, with five firms being bullish and three firms taking a bearish stance. The consensus estimate reflects a year-over-year improvement of about 48.3%.Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $20,183 million for the third quarter, up 2.7% from the year-ago quarter.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Valero is likely to beat earnings because it has the right combination of two key ingredients.Zacks ESP: Valero’s Earnings ESP is +0.27%. A favorable ESP serves as a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.    Zacks Rank: Valero currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 or 3 (Hold) has a significantly higher chance of beating earnings estimates.Conversely, Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.The combination of Valero’s Zacks Rank #2 and +0.27% ESP makes us reasonably optimistic of an earnings beat.What’s Driving Better-than-Expected Earnings?Among independent refiners, Valero has the most diversified refinery base. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s refining segment earnings stands at $1,372 million, higher than $990 million recorded in the year-ago quarter and $959 million in the prior quarter.Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for throughput margin per barrel from Valero’s refining operations stands at $10.88, much higher than $8.66 in the preceding quarter and $9.07 in the year-ago quarter.We also appreciate the company’s strong balance sheet as reflected in the rising cash balance since 2015. Also, the company’s debt load has reduced over the same time frame.  Q3 Price OutperformanceDuring the quarter, Valero has rallied 14%, outperforming the industry’s 10.5% gain.     Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are some other companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Noble Midstream Partners LP (NBLX  -  Free Report), headquartered in Houston, TX, has diversified energy infrastructure properties.

10,ANDV,"Upstream energy player, EQT Corp (EQT  -  Free Report) is expected to release third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 26.Last quarter, the company reported earnings of 6 cents per share surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 5 cents. Notably, EQT incurred loss of 35 cents in the year-ago quarter. EQT Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  EQT Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | EQT Corporation QuoteWhich Way are Estimates Treading?Let’s look at the estimate revisions in order to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company before earnings release.In the last seven days, two estimates have been raised, taking the Zacks Consensus Estimate to a loss of 2 cents for the third quarter. It reflects year-over-year improvement of about 92.3% from the year-ago quarter.Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $650.1 million for the impending quarter was up 16.8% from the year-ago quarter.Factors to ConsiderDuring 2017, EQT is expected to spend $1.5 billion, out of which $1.3 billion will be allocated toward well developments. A total of 207 wells will be drilled comprising 119 Marcellus wells. The entire funding will be done through cash on hand and operating cash flow, reflecting the company’s strong balance sheet.Per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, the average daily sales volume for the current quarter is estimated at 2,303 million cubic feet equivalent per day (MMcfe/d), which is higher than 2,177 MMcfe/d in the preceding quarter and 2,131 MMcfe/d in the year-ago quarter. The figure is also higher than the company’s projection of 205–210 Bcfe.The company stands to benefit as the midstream business might rake more profits for EQT given the fact that U.S. drillers continue to bank on shale plays. With the rise in production, demand for midstream assets for gathering and transmission activities is likely to scale higher.However, during first-half 2017, EQT’s operating expenses related to transportation and processing activities surged more than 66%. If the trend continues, the company’s revenues might be hurt.Moreover, EQT lacks geographical diversification as its resources are concentrated in the Appalachian Basin. This increases risk exposure of the company as any disruptions in the region will affect financials.Price Performance in Q3During the quarter, EQT has outperformed the industry. The stock has gained 11.3% compared with the industry's growth of 5%.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not show that EQT is likely to beat earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: EQT has an Earnings ESP of -163.91% as the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at a loss of 6 cents, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is of a loss of 2 cents.

11,ANDV,"Upstream energy firm, Range Resources Corporation (RRC  -  Free Report), is set to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 24, after the closing bell.Last quarter, the company delivered earnings of 69 cents per share that beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 6 cents. Notably, the company incurred a loss of 14 cents in the year-ago quarter.Range Resources Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Range Resources Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Range Resources Corporation QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.    Which Way Are Estimates Treading?Let’s look at the estimate revisions in order to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company before earnings release.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of 1 cent for the third quarter has been stable in the last 30 days. Notably, the company incurred a loss of 23 cents in the year-ago quarter. Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $525.95 million for the impending quarter, up 27.3% from the year-ago quarter.Factors to Consider This QuarterFor the third quarter, Range Resources anticipates output at around 1,970 MMcfe per day, higher than 1,944.5 MMcfe/d recorded during second-quarter 2017. Also, the company projects fourth-quarter 2017 output at 2,170 MMcfe per day, representing 17% year-over-year improvement. Considering the recovery of natural gas prices from the multiyear low levels, we expect the company to be able to sell the increased output at higher prices. This, in turn, should boost the company’s third-quarter results.Range Resources also projects capital spending of $1.15 billion for 2017. The raised guidance was issued after two consecutive years of capital budget reduction. The company believes that higher activity along with more spending should support significant production growth in this quarter as well as in the future.Despite these positives, Range Resources’ shares have underperformed the industry in the third quarter. During the aforesaid period, shares of the company have ldeclined 15.5% as against the industry’s gain of 5.1%.Since the beginning of 2012, total debt load at Range Resources has increased considerably. In fact, through all the four quarters of 2016, total debt load increased exponentially with no sign of a decline. This reflects weakness in the company’s balance sheet.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Range Resources will beat estimates this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is pegged at -54.16%.

12,ANDV,"On Oct 17, Valero Energy Corporation (VLO  -  Free Report) was raised to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Why the Upgrade?Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter 2017 earnings has been revised upward to $1.75 from the prior estimate of $1.65. Also, for full-year 2017, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings has been raised to $4.71 from $4.47 over the same time frame.The company’s balance sheet looks strong, reflecting steadily increasing cash balance since 2015. Also, the current debt load contracted over the same time frame. Valero’s operations are not significantly dependent on debt as reflected by its debt-to-capitalization ratio of 0.58%, significantly below 28.54% of the industry.  The company has been returning cash to shareholders on a regular basis. During second- quarter 2017, Valero returned $658 million to stockholders through dividend payments and share buybacks. Also, Valero’s dividend yield of 3.6% is impressive and higher than 3.1% of the industry.Given that gasoline prices have been low as compared to the mid-2014 level following persistent crude weakness, the demand for refined products has been healthy. Also, record September auto sales will likely drive demand for gasoline. According to Autodata Corp, the seasonally adjusted annual sales rate for all U.S. light vehicles touched 18.57 million units last month, up from 16.14 million in the prior month. It also marked the highest sales rate since July 2005.Following healthy gasoline demand, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s third-quarter 2017 profit from the refining segment came in at $1,372 million, higher than $959 million in the preceding quarter and $1,280 million in the year-ago quarter.Valero’s pricing chart looks impressive.

Moreover, Schlumberger delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 7.58% over the last four quarters.

Notably, this is the highest quarterly gain since the April-to-June quarter of 2016.  Also, according to The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), the average monthly price for the three months of third-quarter 2017 was higher than the year-ago period.Nevertheless, we are concerned about the decline in cash balance over the last six quarters. Also, long-term debt has been on the rise in the same time frame, reflecting a weak balance sheet.  Price Performance in Q3During the quarter, Schlumberger rallied 5.9%, outperforming the industry’s 3.8% gain.  Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Schlumberger is likely to beat earnings this quarter.

14,ANDV,"Midstream energy assets operator Kinder Morgan Inc (KMI  -  Free Report) is expected to report third-quarter 2017 earnings on Oct 18.Last quarter, the company delivered an earnings surprise of 0.00%. However, Kinder Morgan delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 1.67% for the last four quarters. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to the announcement.Kinder Morgan, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Kinder Morgan, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Kinder Morgan, Inc. Quote Which Way Are Estimates Treading?Let’s look at the estimate revisions in order to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company before earnings release.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of 14 cents for the third quarter has been stable in the last seven days. It reflects a year-over-year decline of about 12.5% from the year-ago quarter. Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $3,242 million for the impending quarter, down 2.6% from the year-ago quarter.Factors to ConsiderKinder Morgan has the largest network of natural gas pipelines in North America, spread over almost 70,000 miles. Most importantly, the company’s midstream properties are linked to all the prospective plays in the United States that are rich in natural gas.These extensive networks of natural gas pipelines, for which the company has invested billions of dollars, provide stable fee-based revenues. In fact, Kinder Morgan expects 91% of its 2017 cash flow generation to come from fees charged for midstream properties. Much these revenues would be reflected in the to-be-reported quarter.However, Kinder Morgan’s weak balance sheet is a concern. As of second-quarter 2017, total debt — both short and long term — stands at $37.1 billion. Debt capital is higher than total equity capital of $36.2 billion which depicts the company’s significant exposure to debt. If debt continues to grow, the company may face liquidity issues.Moreover, the company’s Trans Mountain pipeline expansion faces threats. Being a part of the legal dispute, the appeal, if successful, will nullify the federal sanction for the C$7.4-billion or $5.9-billion Trans Mountain project and result in extended postponement. This will be a major drawback for the company.Price Performance in Q3During the quarter, Kinder Morgan underperformed the industry. In the aforesaid period, the stock has gained 0.1% compared with the 1.9% increase of the broader industry.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Kinder Morgan is likely to beat earnings this quarter.

15,ANDV,"Investors generally gauge a stock’s potential return by examining earnings growth and valuation multiples. At the same time, it’s important to measure the performance of such a stock relative to its industry or peers, or the appropriate benchmark.If you see that a stock is underperforming on fundamental factors, then it would be prudent to move on and find a better alternative. However, those outperforming their respective sectors in terms of price should be selected because they stand a better chance to provide considerable returns.Then again, it is imperative that you determine whether or not an investment has relevant upside potential when considering stocks with significant relative price strength.

17,ANDV,"The Q3 earnings season is underway with major banks set to report this week. Earnings for the S&P 500 index are expected to grow 2.3% from the same period last year on 5% higher revenues, as per the latest Earnings Trends.However, earnings growth is on track to be the lowest this year after double-digit growth in each of the first two quarters and with high single-digit expected earnings growth in the last quarter. This is especially true as twin attacks by hurricanes Harvey and Irma have taken toll on many industries such as insurance, energy, airlines and autos. Per Moody's Analytics, the two storms may lead to $150-$200 billion in damages (read: Hurricanes Impact on Earnings ETFs?).While earnings estimates for Q3 have declined from 6.3% at the start of the period, the magnitude of negative revision is lower than the recent quarters. Of the 16 Zacks sectors, seven are likely to be contributors to earnings growth, with energy leading the way. Like the last reporting cycle, the energy sector has the strongest growth projection of 122.3% for Q3, primarily reflecting easier comparisons. This is followed by earnings growth of 16.1% for conglomerates, 9.7% for technology, 8.7% for industrial products, and 8.3% for construction.Given this, we have highlighted one ETF and one stock from some of these sectors that could make great plays as the Q3 earnings season unfolds. Each of these ETFs and stocks have a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). For stocks, we have added the extra flavor of a positive Earnings ESP.

21,ANDV,"We have closed the book for the Q2 earnings season with releases from all S&P 500 Oil/ Energy companies already out. From our article, it is clear that the Energy sector contributed the most to year-over-year earnings growth in the S&P 500 Index.Among the major industries in the Energy sector, we found Q2 performances of the Oil Refining & Marketing industry the most impressive. The refining industry generated huge cash flow from core operations for investors in second-quarter 2017. Also, the industry’s dividend yield is higher than that of the S&P 500 Index. Thus, it is a good time to consider stocks from the oil refining industry.Oil Refining IndustryThis industry mainly deals in downstream operations. Companies belonging to this space have plants that help refine raw crude to produce end products like gasoline, heating oils and diesel. In other words, refining companies buy raw crude from the exploration and production players and sell the refined products.The industry has a good industry rank and is undervalued as compared to the S&P 500 index. Industry RankIn terms of Zacks Industry Rank,Oil Refining Industry is among the top performing industries.The industry is ranked #100 and lies in the top 39% of industries. The industry rank is impressive as the top 50% of the Zacks Ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Undervalued as Compared to S&P 500Compared to the S&P 500, the Oil Refining Industry is undervalued. This implies that the industry has more potential to grow in the near future compared to the index. The Oil Refining industry has a trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA ratio of 8.57, which is below the index’s mark of 10.69. The EV/EBITDA ratio is one of the best multiples for valuing oil and gas companies because energy firms have a large amount of debt and EV (Enterprise Value) has included the parameter.Terrific Q2 Performance With the help of our proprietary model, we picked up key parameters that highlighted the terrific performance of the Oil Refining Industry during the second quarter of this year.Beats S&P 500 The performance of any stock or industry over a specified period of time gets reflected in the pricing chart. The April-to-June quarter has clearly shown that the Oil Refining & Marketing industry has surpassed the S&P 500 Index.During the aforesaid period, the industry has gained 4.4% as compared with the 2.8% improvement of the index. We are highlighting the positive price movement of the Oil Refining industry as many major industries in the Oil/Energy sector have seen negative movements.Cash Flow & Earnings Skyrocket During second-quarter 2017, net cash flow from operations from the Oil Refining industry jumped more than 200% sequentially to $973 million. In other words, the industry saw a marked improvement in cash flow in Q2 from the decline in Q1.On top of that, earnings out of core operations – as measured by earnings before income, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) – was registered at $776 million, highlighting almost 60% improvement from the prior quarter.Lucrative Dividend Yield for Q2Along with improved earnings, the Oil Refining industry also recorded a lucrative dividend yield which outpaced the S&P 500 Index.During the April-to-June quarter of this year, the industry reported dividend yield of 3.35%, which is far better than 1.9% yield of the S&P 500 Index.Refining Stocks in FocusPicking the prospective energy stocks can be a daunting task. To simplify the screening process, we have resorted to our proprietary stock screener. We have primarily picked stocks that have beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the last reported quarter.Headquartered in San Antonio, TX, Andeavor (ANDV  -  Free Report) is involved in the refining and marketing of refined products. The retail marketing business of the company has almost 3,100 stores under renowned fuel brands. Andeavor carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).During second-quarter 2017, Andeavor reported earnings of $1.96 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.61. Higher refinery throughput and improved performance from the marketing and logistics segment drove Q2 numbers. On top of that, the company posted an average positive earnings surprise of 38.94% over the last four quarters.Based in Houston, TX, Phillips 66 (PSX  -  Free Report) – with a Zacks Rank #3 – is a diversified energy manufacturing and logistics company with midstream, chemicals, refining, and marketing and specialties businesses.  Phillips reported earnings of $1.09 per share during the second quarter that surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.02. The improvement can be attributed to higher refining utilization. Moreover, for the last four quarters, the company posted an average positive earnings surprise of 433.14%.Par Pacific Holdings Inc. (PARR  -  Free Report) – headquartered in Houston, TX – has refining operations that include production of ultra-low sulfur diesel, jet fuel and related refined products. In the second quarter, the company posted earnings of 24 cents, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 22 cents.

Higher throughput margin due to 96% throughput capacity utilization supported the numbers. Most importantly, the company – with a Zacks Rank #3 – beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters.Dallas, TX-based HollyFrontier Corporation (HFC  -  Free Report) is one of the largest independent refiners and marketers of petroleum products in the U.S.  The refiner carries a Zacks Rank #3.The company’s net income per share (excluding special items) came in at 66 cents, handily beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 46 cents and significantly ahead of the year-ago 28 cents. The improvement was driven by improving refining margins.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

22,ANDV,"Pipeline operator, Andeavor Logistics LP (ANDX  -  Free Report) announced recently that it will acquire rival Western Refining Logistics LP , including the latter’s $310 million net debt, to extend its hold in the prolific Permian Basin, TX.Lately, the Permian Basin has drawn many oil producers including the likes of oil major ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report), while the existing players are expanding their presence to benefit from the basin’s high production and low-cost characteristics.About the DealPer the $1.5 billion unit-for-unit deal, Andeavor Logistics, formerly known as Tesoro Logistics, will give 0.5233 units for each Western Refining Logistics unit to the latter’s unitholders. It means Andeavor Logistics will pay $25.28 for every Western Refining Logistics unit, which represents a premium of 6.4% to its closing price as of Aug 11, 2017. Andeavor Logistics expects the deal, which awaits regulatory approval from the unitholders of Western Refining Logistics, to be over in the fourth quarter of 2017.We would like to remind investors that the parent entity of Andeavor Logistics, Andeavor (ANDV  -  Free Report) - previously known as Tesoro Corp - had bought Western Refining for $4.1 billion in June. Western Refining was Western Refining Logistics’ parent entity. As part of that deal, Andeavor received a non-controlling stake in Western Refining Logistics.The transaction will increase Andeavor’s ownership to around 127 million units. After the deal closes, Andeavor Logistics is also planning to issue 78 million of its units to Andeavor to cancel its incentive distribution rights.Benefits for Andeavor LogisticsThe deal is in line with Andeavor Logistics' strategy of investing more than $500-$600 million in organic and inorganic growth every year. We would like investors to know that Andeavor Logistics has a two-year backlog of $800-$900 million of identified organic growth projects. The partnership believes that it is well positioned for sustainable growth and the deal will provide additional organic growth opportunities in the Permian Basin. Andeavor recently announced plans to initiate the construction of Conan Crude Oil Gathering Pipeline, worth $225 million, in West Texas, which will be forwarded to Andeavor Logistics after the completion of the deal.The deal will provide Andeavor Logistics the opportunity to increase its asset base by adding more crude oil pipelines and gathering systems in the Permian Basin in West Texas and Southern New Mexico. It will also lead to lower marginal cost of capital, strengthening the partnership’s credit profile. It will receive almost 1134 kilometers of pipelines along with active storage capacity of 12.4 million barrels. Andeavor Logistics will also benefit from Western Refining Logistics' distribution of wholesale petroleum products and crude oil and asphalt trucking businesses.About the Partnership Andeavor Logistics engages in the ownership, operation, development and acquisition of crude oil and refined products logistics assets.

23,ANDV,"Independent oil refiner and marketer Andeavor (ANDV  -  Free Report) – formed following the merger of Tesoro Corporation and El Paso-based Western Refining Inc. – recently announced plans to initiate the construction of Conan Crude Oil Gathering Pipeline in West Texas. The news came a couple of days after the company announced its first earnings release under the new name and delivered better-than-expected earnings.The open season for this 130 mile crude oil pipeline in Delaware Basin (located on the western part of the lucrative Permian Basin) had been launched in May by Western Refining. Apart from bolstering its network of assets, downstream operator Western Refining’s buyout is likely to help Andeavor enhance its geographic footprint in the prolific Permian Basin, driving double-digit earnings growth in 2018. As it is, over the last two years despite the industry’s downturn, the energy companies including Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM  -  Free Report),Noble Energy, Inc. (NBL  -  Free Report) and many othershave been increasing their investment in the prolific Permian Basin owing to its lower costs and widespread infrastructure.The pipeline will begin in the Lea County and will extend to the Loving County, where it will join with other pipelines. Conan Pipeline is also expected to connect with the Wink Pipeline – owned by Kinder Morgan, Inc. (KMI  -  Free Report) – and supply the oil to the company’s El Paso Refinery. The first phase of the pipeline will have a transportation capacity of 250,000 barrels per day (bpd), expandable up to 500,000 bpd in the future phases. The company is expected to invest around $225 million in the first phase of the completion of the pipeline, out of which it is likely to spend $75 million this year. The commercial service of the Conan Pipeline is most likely to begin by mid-2018.Zacks' 10-Minute Stock-Picking SecretSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.

While earnings came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate, revenues lagged the same. Shares of the company declined 1.41% to eventually close at $95.80 on Aug 8 after this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock increased its guidance related to capital and turnaround expenses for the full year. However, the company also increased its throughput levels guidance.Andeavor reported second-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings from continuing operations of $1.96 per share, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.61. Improved performance from the marketing and logistics segment drove results. The bottom line, however, deteriorated from the year-ago quarter figure of $3.47 per share on significantly weaker performance by the refining segment.Andeavor reported quarterly revenues of $7,849 million as against $6,285 million in the year-ago quarter, reflecting growth of 24.9%. However, the top line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8,091 million.  Andeavor Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Andeavor Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Andeavor QuoteSegmental AnalysisRefining: The segment posted operating income of $45 million compared with $527million in the year-ago quarter. Decrease in refining margins weakened the quarterly result.Logistics: During the second quarter, this segment generated operating profit of $167 million compared with $118 million in the year-ago quarter. The performance was driven by contributions from the acquisitions of the North Dakota Gathering and Processing Assets, the Northern California Terminalling and Storage Assets, Alaska Storage and Terminalling Assets.Marketing: The segment recorded $236 million compared with $161 million in second-quarter 2016. Performance in the quarter was negatively impacted by increased demand and higher margins. Retail and Branded fuel margins were up by 17% and Merchandise gross margin increased to $20 million from $2 million in second-quarter 2016 driven by the Western Refining acquisition.ThroughputTotal refining throughput averaged 893 thousand barrels per day (MBbl/d) as against 802 MBbl/d in the prior-year quarter.Overall, throughput volumes in California (consisting of Martinez and Los Angeles refineries) rose from 513 MBbl/d to 531 MBbl/d, on a year-over-year basis. Throughput in Andeavor's Pacific Northwest (Alaska and Washington) operations was 170 MBbl/d, compared with 158 MBbl/d in second-quarter 2016. Throughput volumes in the Mid-Continent (North Dakota and Utah) were up by 44.6% to 192 MBbl/d in the repotted quarter.Refining MarginsGross refining margin decreased 39.8% year over year to $9.44 per barrel.  Region-wise, refining margin was down almost 32% to $10.78 per barrel in California, 65.5% to $4.72 in the Pacific Northwest and about 43% to $9.96 in Mid-Continent, on a year-over-year basis.  Realized Costs & PricesManufacturing costs before depreciation and amortization increased 13.2% from the year-earlier level to $5.67 per barrel. The improvement came on the back of higher energy costs.Total refined product sales averaged 1092 Mbbl/d in the reported quarter as against 974 Mbbl/d in second-quarter 2016.Operating CostAndeavor's operating costs in the reported quarter were $739 million compared with $602 million in second-quarter 2016.Capital Expenditure & Balance SheetAndeavor’s total capital spending in the reported quarter including Andeavor Logistics LP (ANDX  -  Free Report) totaled $263 million. Turnaround expenditures for the second quarter were $196 million. As of Jun 31, 2017, the company had $1,061 million of cash and cash equivalents. This was down from $2,298 million in the prior quarter primarily due to due to the closure of the Western Refining acquisition and Andeavor Logistics’ acquisition of the North Dakota Gathering and Processing Assets. Excluding Andeavor Logistics’ debt and equity, total debt was $3.1 billion.DividendThe board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 59 cents per share reflecting an increase of 7.3%, payable on Sep 15, to all holders of record as of Aug 31.GuidanceAndeavor expects throughput level for the third  quarter between 1,090 MBbl/d and 1,145 MBbl/d. Region wise, California expects throughput volumes between 505 and 530 MBbl/d. Pacific Northwest and Mid Continent expects throughput levels within 185–195 MBbl/d and 400 –420 MBbl/d respectively.The company now expects total capital expenditures for 2017 of approximately $1.35 billion, up from the prior guidance of $1.1 billion. Turnaround expenditures for the full year 2017 are expected to be $485 million.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked players in the energy space are TransCanada Corporation (TRP  -  Free Report) and Braskem S.A.

25,ANDV,"The Q2 earnings season has long crossed the half way mark, with results from 420 S&P 500 members that account for 86.7% of the index’s total market capitalization. It is to be noted that as many as 35 S&P 500 members are set to release their quarterly results this week.The Picture So FarAs per the latest Earnings Preview, total earnings for these companies rose 11.6% from the same period last year on 5.6% higher revenues, with 74.3% beating earnings and 68.3% trumping revenue estimates.Energy Outshines Other SectorsWe have divided the S&P 500 Index into 16 Zacks Sectors. As per our report, among all the sectors, Oil/Energy has witnessed the highest year-over-year earnings growth. So far, 93.5% of Oil/Energy companies have reported with a combined picture of 313.3% earnings growth. The other sectors significantly lag Oil/Energy.Healthy Oil & Gas Performance in Q2The oil and gas pricing scenario in second-quarter 2017 was substantially better than the year-ago period.Hopes of OPEC’s production cut deal extension was the prime factor driving the year-over-year hike in prices during April and almost the entire of May. Market anticipations proved somewhat correct as OPEC and 11 non-OPEC players, including Russia, decided to extend the production cut deal until Mar 2018 in the Vienna meeting.Natural gas also made a modest recovery in Q2 after the commodity hit its lowest annual average price in 2016 in almost 20 years.Energy Explorers & Downstream Players to Watch for EarningsLet’s see what’s in store for five such companies expected to come up with second-quarter numbers on Aug 8.

26,ANDV,"Independent oil refiner and marketer Andeavor (ANDV  -  Free Report) – formed following the merger of Tesoro Corporation and El Paso-based Western Refining Inc. – is set to release second-quarter 2017 results after the closing bell on Aug 8. Tesoro completed the merger on Jun 1 and renamed itself to Andeavor, which started trading on NYSE under the ticker ANDV from Aug 1.San Antonio, TX-based downstream operator Andeavor – which counts Marathon Petroleum Corporation (MPC  -  Free Report), Valero Energy Corporation (VLO  -  Free Report) and Phillips 66 (PSX  -  Free Report) among its peers – posted a positive earnings surprise of 44.44% in the preceding quarter. Significant contribution from the logistics segment and improved performance of the refining segment drove the results.  Coming to earnings surprise history, the company has an impressive record. The company has topped estimates in each of the last four quarters with an average positive surprise of 57.52%.Andeavor Price and EPS Surprise Andeavor Price and EPS Surprise |  Andeavor QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at playApart from bolstering its network of assets, downstream operator Western Refining’s buyout is likely to help Andeavor enhance its geographic footprint in the prolific Permian Basin, driving double-digit earnings growth in 2018. In June, Andeavor earned credit rating upgrade from both S&P and Fitch on healthy financials and decent coverage and liquid ratios. The company also intends to repurchase shares to offset the dilution associated with the merger.  The company also clinched a deal with Mexico’s Pemex Logística which is expected to strengthen its geographical foothold in Mexico and expand its marketing business under the ARCO brand. The company will also be able to utilize El Paso refining capacity that it has access to now, thanks to the acquisition. This bodes well for the company’s long-term growth opportunities.Although crude ended the second quarter of this year with a decline of 8.4%, the pricing environment of commodities was much healthier than the year-ago quarter, courtesy of the historical OPEC agreement. Andeavor is unlikely to benefit from the improvement in oil prices as the input cost for refiners increase with a price hike. Also, rising costs due to tougher RIN obligations are likely to weigh on the earnings and margins of the company. The RIN expense has increased from $3.3 to $3.5 per barrel in the second quarter when compared with the year-ago quarter.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Andeavor will beat estimates this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to surpass estimates. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP FilterThat is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is 0.00%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are both pegged at $1.61.Zacks Rank: Andeavor currently carries a Zacks Rank #3. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. Though a favorable Zacks Rank increases the predictive power of ESP, the company’s Earnings ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.Conversely, we caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Ranks #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - Q1 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 11X over. Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we're willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation. See Them Free>>

27,ANDV,"The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC, aka ""the Fed"") will meet on Tuesday and Wednesday (Oct 30-31). Most market participants expect a rate cut to be announced, but this is not a certainty. The downside risk is that committee's inflation hawks stand their ground and vote down a rate cut. Such a decision would create turbulence in both the stock and bond markets over fears that the Fed is not being proactive enough. I don't think the Fed will spook investors on Halloween; rather, I believe a 25 basis point rate cut will be announced. Furthermore, the meeting's statement will suggest a willingness by the committee to do what is necessary to maintain economic growth.
"
28,ANDV,"Among the economic data the Fed will have to consider will be the Conference Board's October survey of consumer confidence, advance third-quarter GDP, September construction spending and the October Chicago PMI. The consumer confidence survey will published on Tuesday, the other three reports will be published on Wednesday.
"
29,ANDV,"Staying on the economic calendar, September personal income and spending data, September pending home sales and the October ISM manufacturing index will be released on Thursday. Friday will feature October employment data and September factory orders.
"
30,ANDV,"Competing with the economic data will be earnings reports from approximately 850 companies, 96 of which belong to the S&P 500. Three Dow components are also expected to step up to the plate: Exxon Mobil (XOM  -  Free Report), Proctor & Gamble (PG  -  Free Report) and Verizon Communications (VZ  -  Free Report). In addition to XOM, 11 other large-cap oil companies are scheduled to report. Despite crude's march towards $100 per barrel, brokerage analysts have lowered third-quarters forecasts on nine of these 12 companies and lowered fourth-quarter forecasts on five of the 12.
"
31,ANDV,"There are a few other noteworthy items on the calendar. Monday will be the anniversary of the 1929 crash (technically the anniversary is Sunday and Monday). Wednesday night is Halloween. (Boo!) November begins on Thursday and it has traditionally marked the start of a good six-month period to own stocks. (The Stock Trader's Almanac notes that the Dow has been up on Nov 1 during 22 out of the last 28 times. Given that Fed will announce its decision on Wednesday, I would suggest not using this streak as a reason to buy stocks.) Daylight savings time (set your clocks back one hour) starts on Sunday, Nov 4.
"
32,ANDV,"Third-Quarter Earnings Performance
"
33,ANDV,"As the proportion of financial companies reporting third-quarter results has dropped, the rate of profit growth has increased. Through Thursday evening, the median company within the S&P 500 has generated year-over-year profit growth of 11.5% on a per share basis. The ratio of positive to negative surprises is running at 2.7:1. These numbers are based on reports from approximately 280 companies.
"
34,ANDV,"Expanding the universe to the S&P 1500 Composite (S&P 500, S&P MidCap 400 and S&P SmallCap 600), median growth is 10.9%. Positive surprises are outnumbering negative surprises by a margin of 2:1.
"
35,ANDV,"Third-quarter earnings have  clearly been impacted by the ongoing credit crisis. For example, I ran the growth numbers for the S&P 1500 Composite with banks and savings & loans excluded. The median growth rate rose by nearly 200 basis points. The overall numbers don't reflect the impact of forecasts that were lowered ahead of earnings reports or retailers, whose third-quarter hasn't ended yet. Therefore, the actual drag on growth is bigger. Partially offsetting the credit crunch is the impact of share repurchases, the weak dollar and faster economic growth abroad. Simply put, we know that the credit crunch is slowing earnings, but it's difficult to quantify the exact speed of the headwind.
"
36,ANDV,"Companies That Could Issue Positive Earnings Surprises during the Week of Oct 29 - Nov 2American Axle & Manufacturing (AXL  -  Free Report) has been the beneficiary of two positive earnings estimate revisions by brokerage analysts recently. The revisions have resulted in a four-cent increase in the consensus estimate to 29 cents per share. The most accurate consensus is more bullish at 41 cents per share. AXL has topped expectations for two consecutive quarters. American Axle & Manufacturing is scheduled to report on Tuesday, Oct 30.
"
37,ANDV,"Callaway Golf Company (ELY  -  Free Report) recently preannounced third-quarter results. The company estimates that its profits will be between breakeven and two cents per share; brokerage analysts had been forecasting a loss of four cents per share. ELY is enjoying strong sales of woods, irons, golf balls and accessories as well as improved gross margins. After previously missing estimates four consecutive times, ELY has turned things around with two consecutive positive surprises. (Some readers may recall that I predicted the golf company could begin topping expectations last April). The consensus estimate calls for ELY to breakeven, but the most accurate consensus is calling for profits of a penny per share. Callaway Golf is scheduled to report on Thursday, Nov 1, after the close of trading.
"
38,ANDV,"Omniture (OMTR) has topped expectations for four consecutive quarters. Ahead of the business optimization software company's third-quarter report, brokerage analysts have narrowed their loss projections. The consensus estimate now calls for a loss of two cents per share, a penny less than the average forecast of a month ago. The most accurate forecast is considerably more bullish and calls for a profit of four cents per share. Omniture is scheduled to report on Tuesday, Oct 30, after the close of trading.
"
39,ANDV,"Approximately one-third of the covering brokerage analysts have raised their forecasts on Safeco (SAF) within the past 30 days. The cumulative impact of these revisions has been a seven-cent jump in the consensus forecast to $1.53 per share. The most accurate consensus is more optimistic at $1.55 per share. SAF has topped expectations for three consecutive quarters. SAF is scheduled to report on Tuesday, Oct 30, before the start of trading.
"
40,ANDV,"Companies That Could Issue Negative Earnings Surprises during the Week of Oct 29 - Nov 2
"
41,ANDV,"The sharp rise in oil prices may not translate into an upbeat report for refiner Tesoro (TSO). Higher feedstock costs and a seasonal decline in margins are expected to have weighed down margins. As a result, more than half of the covering brokerage analysts have cut their third-quarter forecasts within the past 30 days. The consensus estimate calls for earnings of $1.15 per share, 56 cents below the average forecast of a month ago. The most accurate consensus calls for profits of 93 cents per share. TSO has missed once during the past four quarters. Tesoro is scheduled to report on Thursday, Nov 1, before the start of trading.Charles Rotblut, CFA, is the senior market analyst for Zacks.com.

46,ANDV,"Im excited to share a new screen with you this week. 
"
47,ANDV,"Its a very robust strategy in and of itself, and works exceedingly well with many of our other strategies that come loaded with the Research Wizard program.  Parameters Zacks Rank 
"
48,ANDV,"The % of Brokers Ranking the Stocks a Strong Buy/Buy >= 50% 
"
49,ANDV,"(Im looking for stocks that have a Strong Buy or Buy Rating from Zacks or is ranked Strong Buy or Buy with 50% or more of brokers.) Price to Sales 
"
50,ANDV,"(A Price to Sales Ratio of 1 means youre paying $1 for every $1 of sales the company makes. A P/S Ratio of .75 means youre paying only 75 cents for every $1 of sales the company makes  which is a great value.) ROE >= 15 
"
51,ANDV,"(This is net income divided by common equity and is a measure of how good a company is being run. In other words, a company with an ROE means that 15 cents of assets are being created for every one dollar of shareholders equity.) Current Price >= 5 Average 20-Day Volume >= 100,000 
"
52,ANDV,"(I want to make sure its well traded.) % Rating Change over the last 4 Weeks = Top # 5
"
53,ANDV,"(This narrows the screen down to the five stocks (always only five stocks) with the biggest, (i.e. best) increase in the Average Broker Rating.) Results
"
54,ANDV,"I ran a series of separate tests over the last six-year time span using a four-week holding period and starting each run on a different start date to eliminate coincidence and to verify robustness. 
"
55,ANDV,"In 2001, this screen showed an average compounded gross return of 51.4%. 
"
56,ANDV,"In 2002, it showed a 36% return. 2003; a whopping 91.2% return. 2004 showed a 35.9% return. 2005 was 44.4%. 
"
57,ANDV,"And in 2006, the average compounded gross returns were 58.4%. 
"
58,ANDV,"Wow! 
"
59,ANDV,"Ive also been experimenting with a slightly higher percentage of Strong Buys/Buys and have found that 60% does very well too. But much higher than that starts diminishing returns instead of increasing them. 
"
60,ANDV,"Give this strategy a try in your own trading and see how it can help you pick better stocks. 
"
61,ANDV,"This strategy always picks only five stocks per run.

"
64,ANDV,"As I drove to the train yesterday, the temperature outside was -2 degrees. The cold snap that is gripping the northern Midwest would seem to be a good sign for energy stocks. Certainly, the weather helped oil rebound to nearly $60 per barrel. But, the trend in earnings estimate revisions is not giving that warm, fuzzy feeling.
"
65,ANDV,"Earnings estimates for oil-related stocks have been under pressure because of the pullback in oil prices that occurred in late December and early January. As prices fluctuate, brokerage analysts adjust their models to reflect where they think oil will trade at in the future. The price of crude not only impacts the profitability of producers, but also affects how much they are willing to spend on capital projects. In addition, there is the issue of year-over-year comparisons and what type of growth rate oil companies could really achieve this year. In the backdrop of falling prices, some brokerage analysts are choosing to be conservative. Therefore, it is not surprising to see multiple oil-related stocks on the Zacks #5 Rank (strong sell) List, including BJ Services (BJS) and BP (BP  -  Free Report).
"
66,ANDV,"It should be noted, however, that there has been a recent improvement in the revisions to full-year estimates for the stocks within the 12 oil-related industry groups. Over the past seven days, a cumulative 62 estimates have been revised upward, while just 53 have been revised downward. The devil in the details is that most of these revisions are a reaction to earnings reports and not rising crude prices. For example, eight analysts raised their forecasts on Tesoro (TSO) and six analysts raised their forecasts on Valero (VLO  -  Free Report) after both companys delivered bullish fourth-quarter reports. (TSO is a Zacks #2 Rank (buy) stock and VLO is a Zacks #3 Rank (hold) stock.)
"
67,ANDV,"What is interesting is that for a large part of last year, brokerage analysts underestimated the ability of crude to stay at elevated prices and thus found themselves revising forecasts. Whether analysts are any more accurate this year remains to be seen, but to date, earnings estimates are not rising with the price of oil or oil-related stocks.
"
68,ANDV,"Whether the recent cold snap will have a lasting impact on coal prices is also questionable. Coal prices recently rebounded after having been under pressure because of weakness in natural gas prices and warmer than usual temperatures in December and January; however, there are bearish factors that could limit the upward move. Winter is more than halfway over. The Democrat-controlled Congress is likely to be less friendly towards clean burning coal, a technology the Bush administration would like to promote. The report from the International Panel on Climate Change only added to the political headwinds. And Punxsutawney Phil predicted that spring is right around the corner.
"
69,ANDV,"In addition to the macro factors impacting the industry, 2007 production guidance from Consol Energy (CNX  -  Free Report) and Massey Energy (MEE) was not viewed favorably by brokerage analysts. CNX anticipates producing between 67.4 million and 71.4 million tons this year (64.7 million tons were committed as of Jan 11). In comparison, CNX produced 68.9 million tons last year. MEE has commitments for 40.8 million tons and believes it could produce an additional two million tons. Last year, MEE produced 39.1 million tons.
"
70,ANDV,"In response to the guidance, 11 brokerage analysts cut their earnings forecasts on Consol Energy and nine cut their forecasts on Massey Energy. The current consensus estimate calls for CNX to earn $2.35 this year, down 39 cents from a few weeks ago. In regards to MEE, brokerage analysts project profits of $1.33, 21 cents less than they previously did. Both CNX and MEE are Zacks #5 Rank (strong sell) and are classified in the Coal group.

"
73,ANDV,"Which valuation metric is better: the PEG ratio or the P/E ratio? 
"
74,ANDV,"Before we answer that question, let's first start with some basics. Definitions 
"
75,ANDV,"The P/E ratio is simply: Price / Earnings 
"
76,ANDV,"Essentially, this tells you how much an investor is willing to pay for each unit (year) of earnings. If a stock is trading at a P/E ratio of 30, it is said to be trading at 30x times its annual earnings. 
"
77,ANDV,"In general, the lower the P/E ratio the better. A common threshold for many investors is a P/E of 20 or less. (For the record, at the time of this writing, the S&P 500 Index was trading at a P/E (using F1 Estimates) of 15.33.) 
"
78,ANDV,"A PEG ratio is the: P/E Ratio divided by the Growth Rate 
"
79,ANDV,"Conventional wisdom says a value of 1 or less is considered good (at par or undervalued to its growth rate), while a value of greater than 1, in general, is not as good (overvalued to its growth rate). 
"
80,ANDV,"Many believe the PEG ratio tells a more complete story than just the P/E ratio. (The S&P at the time of this writing had a PEG ratio of 1.93.) Comparison 
"
81,ANDV,"Let's take a look at both of these in action. 
"
82,ANDV,"For example: a company with a P/E Ratio of 25 and a Growth Rate of 20% would have a PEG ratio of 1.25 (25 / 20= 1.25). 
"
83,ANDV,"While a company with a P/E Ratio of 40 and a Growth Rate of 50% would have a PEG Ratio of 0.80 (40 / 50= 0.80). 
"
84,ANDV,"Traditionally, investors would look at the stock with the lower P/E ratio and deem it a bargain (undervalued). But looking at it closer, you can see it doesn't have the growth rate to justify its P/E. 
"
85,ANDV,"The stock with the P/E of 40, however, is actually the better bargain since its PEG ratio is lower (0.80) and is trading at a discount to its growth rate. 
"
86,ANDV,"In other words, the lower the PEG ratio, the better the value. That's because the investor would be paying less for each unit of earnings growth. 
"
87,ANDV,"So which one is better? 
"
88,ANDV,"They both have their usefulness. I do like how the PEG positions the P/E ratio in relation to its growth rate to put everything into perspective. 
"
89,ANDV,"Quite frankly, I use both, so I'm going to say it's a tie. Plus, you couldn't even create the PEG ratio without the P/E. 
"
90,ANDV,"But, you don't have to choose one or the other. You can use both. And that's how we're using it in this week's screen. Screen Parameters 
"
91,ANDV,"Let's first start with: 
"
92,ANDV,"• Zacks Rank equal to 1
"
93,ANDV,"(Only stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 Strong Buy can get thru.) 
"
94,ANDV,"• Projected One Year Growth Rate greater than S&P 500
"
95,ANDV,"(Market outperformers are what we're looking for. The 1 year projected growth rate for the S&P is currently 7.94%. So only those above that will qualify.) 
"
96,ANDV,"• P/E Ratio (using F1) less than or equal to 20 AND less than or equal to X Industry Median  
"
97,ANDV,"(Not only do we want our P/Es to be below their classic valuation threshold, but we want them to be below the median for their industry as well.) 
"
98,ANDV,"• PEG Ratio less than or equal to 1 AND less than or equal to X Industry Median 
"
99,ANDV,"(P/E divided by its (F1) projected growth rate. This one also has to be below its classic valuation marker and have a PEG ratio below the median for its industry. This ensures that they are considered undervalued on an absolute basis as well as undervalued relative to its group of peers.)  
"
100,ANDV,"• Price greater than or equal to $5 
"
101,ANDV,"• Avg. 20 Day Volume greater than or equal to 100,000  
"
102,ANDV,"This screen will find stocks with market beating growth rates, yet still be considered undervalued on two of the most effective valuation markers. And of course, with the Zacks Rank added to it, each one of these picks will be experiencing upward earnings estimate revisions, which provides a timely catalyst for the stock to move. Results

115,ANDV,"Merger and acquisition activities across the globe hit record highs in the first half of 2018 driven by growing ambition of American companies.According to the latest Thomson Reuters Deals Intelligence data, global mergers and acquisitions totaled more than $2.5 trillion, up 64% from the year-ago level and marked the strongest year-to-date period since records began in 1980. With this rise, the mergers are on track to surpass $5 trillion in 2018, which would top 2015, the highest yearly total on record (read: How to Play the Surge in Global M&A With ETFs).The massive increase in M&A activity came despite growing global trade tensions. United States M&A volumes climbed 82% to $1 trillion, the country’s strongest period for deal making on record. This was followed by European deals, which nearly doubled to $767 billion in the first half.Most of the boost came from media and healthcare deals. The proposed media M&A has totaled $322.5 billion so far – up more than six times from the year-ago level. The sector is poised for more consolidation in the coming months as a federal judge ruling on AT&T’s (T  -  Free Report) $85.4 billion purchase of Time Warner  set the stage for waves of M&A in the media space that would change the landscape of the industry (read: Comcast Outbids Disney for Fox Assets: Media ETFs Surge).Big deals have driven much of the activity as total number of deals valued at $10 billion or more surged to 36 in the first half of 2018. These constituted $950 billion in deals, or nearly 38% of all activity. The bidding war for Rupert Murdoch’s Twenty-First Century Fox (FOXA  -  Free Report) was the largest contributor. This was followed by health insurer Cigna’s (CI  -  Free Report) deal to purchase Express Scripts Holding (ESRX  -  Free Report) for $67 billion and Japan’s Takeda Pharmaceutical purchase deal of Shire for $62.4 billion (read: Cigna to Buy Express Scripts: Healthcare ETFs in Focus).The boom in M&A is likely to continue, given an accelerating economy, still-low interest rates, and tax reform, which allow companies to bring offshore cash back home. Potential cost savings through mergers are further fueling the urge to merge in the current ultra-competitive environment.How to Tap?Investors could easily take advantage of this surge in deals by employing the merger arbitrage strategy in their portfolio. This strategy looks to tap the price differential (or spread) between the stock price of the target company after the public announcement of its proposed acquisition and the price offered by the acquirer to pay for the stock of the target company. This is especially true given that investors should go long on the target or the acquired company and short on the acquiring company. When the deal is completed, shares of the target company will increase to the full deal price (in some cases slightly below the deal price), giving investors a nice profit.Below, we have highlighted three merger ETFs to ride out the surge from the increasing M&A deals. Any of these could make compelling options for investors seeking to implement this low correlation strategy to their portfolio: IQ Merger Arbitrage ETF (MNA  -  Free Report) This fund offers capital appreciation by investing in global companies for which there has been a public announcement of a takeover by an acquirer while at the same time providing short exposure to global equities as a partial equity market hedge. This is done by tracking the IQ Merger Arbitrage Index. The fund has 61 holdings in its basket with the largest allocation to Rockwell Collins (COL  -  Free Report) and Andeavor (ANDV  -  Free Report) on the long side with each accounting for more than 8% share. The product has amassed $629.2 million in its asset base and trades in average volume of around 131,000 shares a day. It charges 77 bps in annual fees. The ETF has lost about 0.3% year to date (see: all the Hedge Funds ETFs here). ProShares Merger ETF (MRGR  -  Free Report) This product provides exposure to a global merger arbitrage strategy, which seeks to capture the spread between the price at which the stock of a company (a target) trades after a proposed acquisition is announced and the value (cash plus stock) that the acquiring company has proposed to pay for the stock of the target (a spread). This can be easily done by the S&P Merger Arbitrage Index. The fund holds a well-diversified portfolio of 39 stocks and charges 75 bps in annual fee. Healthcare, financials, real estate and technology are the top four sectors. The ETF has been able to manage assets worth $4.5 million while it sees light volume of just 1,000 shares a day. It is down nearly 1% so far this year. Bottom Line While investors could capitalize on merger arbitrage by trading in a particular target company stock, the ETFs provide diversified exposure in the basket form with lower risk. Further, these could be excellent choices for investors in the rocky market due to their low correlation with the overall market. This is because companies in merger and acquisition deals generally move independently, ignoring all other issues that influence the movement of other stocks. As a result, investors could definitely focus on these products for relatively higher returns in any type of market.Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.

116,ANDV,"If you're interested in broad exposure to the Mid Cap Value segment of the US equity market, look no further than the iShares Morningstar Mid-Cap Value ETF (JKI  -  Free Report), a passively managed exchange traded fund launched on 06/28/2004.The fund is sponsored by Blackrock. It has amassed assets over $423.68 M, making it one of the average sized ETFs attempting to match the Mid Cap Value segment of the US equity market.Why Mid Cap ValueCompared to large and small cap companies, mid cap businesses tend to have higher growth prospects and are less volatile, respectively, with market capitalization between $2 billion and $10 billion. Thus, companies that fall under this category provide a stable and growth-heavy investment.Value stocks have lower than average price-to-earnings and price-to-book ratios. They also have lower than average sales and earnings growth rates. Considering long-term performance, value stocks have outperformed growth stocks in almost all markets; however, they are more likely to underperform growth stocks in strong bull markets.CostsWhen considering an ETF's total return, expense ratios are an important factor, and cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive counterparts in the long term if all other factors remain equal.Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.30%, putting it on par with most peer products in the space.It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 2.46%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsEven though ETFs offer diversified exposure which minimizes single stock risk, it is still important to look into a fund's holdings before investing. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Financials sector--about 18.30% of the portfolio. Consumer Discretionary and Utilities round out the top three.Looking at individual holdings, Freeport Mcmoran Inc (FCX  -  Free Report) accounts for about 1.26% of total assets, followed by Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB  -  Free Report) and Andeavor (ANDV  -  Free Report).The top 10 holdings account for about 11.37% of total assets under management.Performance and RiskJKI seeks to match the performance of the Morningstar Mid Value Index before fees and expenses. The Morningstar Mid Value Index measures the performance of stocks issued by mid-capitalization companies.The ETF has added roughly 0.76% so far this year and was up about 9.43% in the last one year (as of 06/27/2018). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $144.45 and $168.36.The ETF has a beta of 0.95 and standard deviation of 14.03% for the trailing three-year period, making it a medium risk choice in the space. With about 192 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.AlternativesIShares Morningstar Mid-Cap Value ETF carries a Zacks ETF Rank of 3 (Hold), which is based on expected asset class return, expense ratio, and momentum, among other factors. Thus, JKI is a good option for those seeking exposure to the Mid Cap ETFs area of the market. Investors might also want to consider some other ETF options in the space.The Vanguard Mid-Cap Value ETF (VOE  -  Free Report) and the iShares Russell Mid-Cap Value ETF (IWS  -  Free Report) track a similar index. While Vanguard Mid-Cap Value ETF has $8.46 B in assets, iShares Russell Mid-Cap Value ETF has $10.64 B. VOE has an expense ratio of 0.07% and IWS charges 0.25%.Bottom-LinePassively managed ETFs are becoming increasingly popular with institutional as well as retail investors due to their low cost, transparency, flexibility and tax efficiency. They are excellent vehicles for long term investors.To learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.

117,ANDV,"Andeavor (ANDV  -  Free Report) recently announced its intention of constructing a new terminal for the refined products at the Mexican state-run electric utility, Comisión Federal de Electricidad’s (“CFE”) Rosarito storage facility, located in the Baja California state. Per the terms of Andeavor’s deal with CFE’s subsidiary, CFEnergía, the former will take lease of the site for a long-term, where it plans to build the facility.Andeavor expects to invest $100 million in the project, which will enable the company to reduce its import expenses. With the completion of the project, Andeavor will bring fuel directly in the Baja California state from its West Coast refineries.Moreover, the facility is expected to support the growth of its ARCO®-branded stations.

118,ANDV,"HollyFrontier Corporation (HFC  -  Free Report) has been in investors' good books for quite some time now, owing to its refining strength, diversified operations and strategic strides. The downstream operator has had an impressive run on the bourses, with its shares surging by a whopping 208.8%, handily outperforming the industry’s growth of 64.5%.Let’s take a look at some of the factors that have been aiding this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company’s growth and helping it to sustain as a lucrative bet. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Refining Segment: The Real Needle-MoverHollyFrontier is one of the largest independent oil refiners in the United States, with a combined crude oil processing capacity of approximately 457,000 barrels per day. A major advantage of the company is the high-complexity index — the capability to process a wide mix of crude — and its access to some of the fastest-growing domestic markets, afforded by its portfolio of five refineries.While the company has successfully diversified its business by investing in the midstream activities, along with Lubricants and Specialty Products unit, its refining segment still remains the strongest, being the main contributor to its earnings. In the last reported quarter, net income from the segment was $309.3 million, reflecting a massive turnaround from the year-ago quarter’s loss of more than $94 million.In spite of the recovering crude strength, refining environment has been favorable for the company, as it has been taking advantage of the pricing discrepancies of various crude oils. Since HollyFrontier has the capacity to refine heavy or sour crude, unlike many other refiners, the company can purchase crude at discounted prices, thereby securing higher margins. Along with that, the company has also managed to run its facilities at high utilization rates, thereby helping it to reduce per-barrel operating costs.IDR-Simplification Deal Bodes WellWith the completion of the incentive distribution rights (IDR) deal with its partnership last October, HollyFrontier now owns more than 59% stake and a non-economic general partner interest in Holly Energy Partners L.P. (HEP  -  Free Report). The IDR deal has incentivized the company to manage operations efficiently, tap acquisition opportunities and improve payout for both HollyFrontier and Holly Energy. Holly Energy helps the company achieve fee-based revenues with limited commodity price exposure. In the last reported quarter, the segment profitability was $64.4 million, up from $52.1 million in the year-ago period.Strategic Acquisition Boosts ProfitabilityThe Petro-Canada Lubricants acquisition of 2017 helped HollyFrontier expand into the high-margin, less competitive business of producing specialty lubricants. While being immediately accretive to the company's earnings and cash flows, the deal was a smart one as it allowed HollyFrontier to inherit a strong brand portfolio with growing market demand.Healthy Financials Spur Investor-Friendly MovesThe company possesses a robust balance sheet with a manageable debt-to-capital ratio of 28%, providing it with ample financial flexibility.  As a show of confidence in its cash flow generating ability, HollyFrontier resumed its planned buyback activity during the first quarter, shelling out $25.2 million in stock repurchases. The downstream operator also pays a competitive dividend with a healthy yield.Other Favorable ReadingsIn addition to a favorable Zacks Rank, the stock has a VGM Score of A, which highlights its attractiveness. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum, and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores. Such a score allows investors to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners.Its trailing 12-month return on equity (ROE) supports its growth potential. The company’s ROE of 10.2% compares favorably with 9.6% for its industry. This reflects the fact that it is efficient in using its shareholders’ funds.HollyFrontier has also been witnessing solid activity in the earnings estimates front, which further boosts analysts’ optimism in the stock.  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 has increased around 7.5% to $5.28 per share over the past seven days. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 has also moved up 16.5% over the same time frame to $5.93.HollyFrontier is also valued attractively. The company’s forward P/E ratio of 14.9 (versus the industry’s 22.42) and P/S ratio of 0.9 suggest that HollyFrontier is a pretty good value pick, as investors have to pay a relatively lower price for each dollar of earnings, and that it has decent revenue metrics to back up its earnings.Final ThoughtsThe company has set ambitious growth plans for itself, aiming to double the size of each of its segment to gain economies of scale. As it is, the mega-merger news of Marathon Petroleum Corporation (MPC  -  Free Report) and Andeavor (ANDV  -  Free Report) has left investors wondering which companies could be the next in line. With HollyFrontier’s growth goals, it comes as no surprise that the company is in the lookout for prudent acquisitions that can further boost its long-term prospects and add economies of scale.While the company is bearing the brunt of increasing costs, we believe that HollyFrontier can easily tide over this limitation backed by its solid financials, refining strength and diversified operations.As it is, the company’s strategic initiatives to enhance growth are expected to carry the momentum forward. HollyFrontier expects to deliver year-over-year growth of 127.59% in 2018 earnings. Moreover, it seems to be an impressive choice for the growth investors, with an expected earnings improvement rate (next three to five years) of 8.93%.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers.

119,ANDV,"It was a week where oil prices reached their strongest level in over three years, while natural gas futures ended lower on a bearish inventory report.On the news front, energy biggies BP plc (BP  -  Free Report) and EOG Resources, Inc. (EOG  -  Free Report) came up with stronger-than-expected earnings reports, driven by higher oil prices and production, while refiner Marathon Petroleum Corp. (MPC  -  Free Report) agreed to acquire rival Andeavor (ANDV  -  Free Report) for more than $23 billion.Overall, it was a mixed week for the sector. While West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures gained about 2.4% to close at $69.72 per barrel, natural gas prices fell 2.2% to $2.711 per million Btu (MMBtu). (See the last ‘Oil & Gas Stock Roundup’ here: CVX & RDS.A Earnings Impress, XOM & TOT Disappoint)The U.S. oil benchmark settled at three-year highs on the possibility of United States re-imposing sanctions on Iran and sharp declines in output from Venezuela.Of late, crude prices have been supported by indications that the Trump administration might lead America's exit from the landmark Iran nuclear deal if the European allies do not agree to toughen the terms by May 12. The return of sanctions would put pressure on OPEC’s third-largest oil producer’s energy industry and reduce global supply.Fast falling production in Venezuela have added to the jitters. With the country tethering on the verge of an economic collapse, oil output has dwindled by almost 50% since the early 2000s. Venezuela currently churns out just around 1.5 million barrels per day, much lower that its pledge per the OPEC-led supply cuts.Meanwhile, natural gas prices moved northward last week following a larger-than-expected increase in supplies – the first storage build of the injection season when demand is at its weakest ahead of the summer cooling period. Investors were further spooked by expanding dry gas production, which is currently at an all-time high.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    British energy giant BP plc reported strong first-quarter 2018 results on rebounding oil prices, record production and increased refinery throughput.The company’s adjusted earnings of 78 cents per American Depositary Share (ADS) – on a replacement cost basis, excluding non-operating items – surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 67 cents and the year-ago quarter’s 46 cents. Total revenues were $69,143 million in the quarter, up from $56,386 million in the year-ago quarter.Production averaged 2.605 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (MMBoe/d), 9% higher from the year-ago quarter and the most since the fourth quarter of 2010. Importantly, the Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company has now grown output for six quarters in a row. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.BP's net debt was $39,993 million at the end of the first quarter, higher than $38,635 million in the year-ago quarter. Net debt ratio was 28.1%, marginally higher than 28% in the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, the oil behemoth continued to return cash to shareholders through buybacks and dividends payments. Through first-quarter 2018, BP spent $120 million for buying back 18 million shares. (Read more BP Posts Strong Q1 Earnings on Record Upstream Business)2.    Upstream energy company EOG Resources reported first-quarter 2018 adjusted earnings of $1.19, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.01 supported by higher production and increased commodity price realizations. The bottom line also compared favorably with the year-ago quarter profit of 15 cents per share.In the quarter, EOG Resources’ total volume improved 15.6% year over year to 659,900 BOE/d (70% liquids). Average realized crude oil and condensate price was $64.27 per barrel in the reported quarter, compared with $50.34 a year ago.For 2018, the company expects total production between 685,800 BOE/d and 728,500 BOE/d. Of which, crude volumes are projected between 389,400 barrels per day and 405,600 barrels per day. The company expects crude volume to increase between 16% and 20%. For the second quarter, the company anticipates total production between 670,300 BOE/d and 706,200 BOE/d.

The deal also assumes Andeavor’s debt, thus pushing the total value of the transaction to $35.6 billion. The transaction has been unanimously approved by the board of directors of both the companies. Subject to satisfactory closing conditions, along with shareholders’ consent and other regulatory approvals, the deal is set for closure in the second quarter of 2018.Marathon Petroleum’s operations are focused on the Gulf Coast and Midwest while Andeavor’s refinery activities are mainly concentrated in California, the Mid-Continent and Pacific Northwest. The complementary asset base has been the key driver of the deal. (Read more Marathon Petroleum Inks $23.3B Deal to Buy Andeavor)4.    Concho Resources (CXO  -  Free Report) reported strong first-quarter results on the back of higher commodity price realizations and robust production growth. The independent energy explorer came out with net earnings per share of $1.00, comfortably beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 81 cents. The bottom line also improved significantly from the prior-year quarter adjusted income of 49 cents per share.Concho Resources' average quarterly volume increased 25.7% year over year to 227,930 BOE/d, exceeding the high-end of the company’s guidance range, of which 63% was oil. Overall, the company fetched $46.17 per barrel compared with $37.47 a year ago.Concho Capitalizing on its enviable acreage of low-risk top-tier assets and a multiyear drilling inventory, Concho raised its production outlook for 2018. The company now expects output to grow 18%-20% against the prior guidance of 16-20%. Capital expenditure guidance for 2018 remains intact at about $2 billion. Notably, the second-quarter output levels are expected to be between 226 MBoe/d and 230 MBoe/d. (Read more Concho Q1 Earnings Top on Price & Output, Guidance Up)5.    Leading upstream energy company Pioneer Natural Resources Company (PXD  -  Free Report) reported first-quarter 2018 earnings, excluding one-time items, of $1.66 per share. The bottom line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.51 and the year-earlier quarter adjusted earnings of 25 cents per share. Higher oil and liquids price realizations and increased production supported the results.Total production in the reported quarter averaged approximately 312,000 MBOE/d, up 25.3% year over year, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 304,000 BOE/d. The upside can be attributed to the Permian Basin drilling program.The company said that it can exceed its previous 2018 budget estimate of $2.9 billion as it prepares for rig additions during the year-end. For 2018, Pioneer Natural intends to fund its capital expenditure from the forecasted cash flow of around $3.2 billion (based on gas price of $2.80 per Mcf and oil price of $66 per barrel).Pioneer Natural expects production between 312,000 BOE/d and 322,000 BOE/d in the second quarter of 2018. Moreover, the company expects its 2018 production from the prolific Permian Basin to surge 19-24% from the last year. For second quarter, the company expects production costs in the range of $10-$12 per BOE. General and administrative expenses are expected in the range of $90-$95 million.

The best performer was independent refiner Andeavor whose stock jumped 14.2% after the company said it has reached an agreement to be acquired by rival Marathon Petroleum Corporation for $23.3 billion, while offshore operator Transocean Ltd. (RIG  -  Free Report) lagged the pack, down on the week by about 2.7%.Longer-term, over six months, the sector tracker is up 5.6%. Downstream operator,Valero Energy Corporation, is far and away the major gainer during this period, experiencing a 39.9% price fall.What’s Next in the Energy World?With the 2018 Q1 earnings season essentially over, market participants will get back to closely tracking the regular releases i.e. the U.S. government statistics on oil and natural gas - one of the few solid indicators that comes out regularly. Energy traders will also be focusing on the Baker Hughes data on rig count.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars? Here's another stock idea to consider.

120,ANDV,"Andeavor (ANDV  -  Free Report) is set to release first-quarter 2018 results, after the closing bell on May 7.San Antonio, TX-based Andeavor is a refining and marketing company of petroleum products.In the last reported quarter, the company missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.13 for earnings per share by 67.3%. For the trailing four quarters, the company has a negative earnings surprise of 1.2% as it missed estimates twice. Tepid performance by the Refining segment and increased expenses led to the weaker-than-expected results. For the first quarter, the company is expected to report earnings of 58 cents.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Tesoro Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Tesoro Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Tesoro Corporation QuoteWhich Way Are Estimates Trending?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter earnings has seen one upward and seven downward revisions in the last 30 days. As a result, Andeavor has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter earnings being revised 31% downward over the last month. Nevertheless, the expected earnings reflect year-over-year growth of about 11.5%.Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $10.87 billion, reflecting an improvement of 63.7% from the year-ago quarter.Factors at PlayFor first-quarter 2018, the company’s refining segment is likely to impact its bottom line adversely. The recent oil price rally has not only made commodity expensive for refiners but also widened the crack spread and lowered refining margins. In the last reported quarter, the segment posted operating loss of $56 million. While total throughput levels increased, lower margins coupled with higher cost of materials and manufacturing led to the weak results.Per the company’s first-quarter 2018 guidance, throughput volumes in California are expected in the range of 430-455 thousand barrels per day (MBbl/d), lower than the year-ago quarter’s 500 MBbl/d.  . Earnings are likely to be affected by weakness in volumes processed.At the beginning of the first quarter, Andeavor agreed to acquire Rangeland Energy, which has operations in the Delaware and Midland Basins. The acquisition also added crude pipelines, storage terminals, loading facilities in Andeavor’s asset base. Moreover, in February, the company agreed to acquire the West Coast asphalt terminals of the downstream energy company Delek US Holdings, Inc. (DK  -  Free Report) for $75 million along with working capital. These acquisitions are expected to have driven the company’s profits,.What Does Our Model Unveil?Our proven model does not conclusively show a beat for Andeavor this earnings season. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESPand a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Unfortunately, this is not the case here as elaborated below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Andeavor has an ESP of -1.26%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Andeavor carries a Zacks Rank #3. Though a Zacks Rank of #3 increases the predictive power of ESP, a negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Meanwhile, we caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Ranks #4 and 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Energy Stocks With Favorable CombinationHere are some companies from the energy space which, according to our model, have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Abraxas Petroleum Corporation (AXAS  -  Free Report) has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of +13.46%. The company will report earnings on May 8.Contango Oil & Gas Company (MCF  -  Free Report) has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of +32.83%.

121,ANDV,"U.S. stocks closed mixed on the first trading day of May. The Dow declined for the third straight trading session while S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite reversed yesterday’s losses and closed in the green primarily due to strong gains in the technology sector led by Apple Inc.

During yesterday’s trading session, the blue-chip index was once down 1%, nearly touching its lowest close since April 2.Meanwhile, Fed’s two day policy meeting is in progress. Inflationary concerns and rising bond yields increased investor’s expectations that the central bank will raise interest rate very soon. This eventually led to the fall of the blue-chip index.The S&P 500 increased 0.3% led by 1.3% gain of the Technology Select Sector SPDR (XLK). However, six out of 11 sectors of the benchmark index ended in negative territory. The index recorded 4 new 52-week highs and 19 new 52-week lows.The Nasdaq Composite gained 0.9% as strong performance of technology stocks lifted this tech-heavy index. The index recorded 36 new 52-week highs and 72 new 52-week lows.Technology Sector Fueled Broad-based Rally The broader market rally was led by tech behemoth Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report), which was scheduled to report second quarter of fiscal 2018 earnings results after the market close on May 1. High expectations from investors lifted the stock price by 2.3%.Several other tech giants also put in strong showings. These include Microsoft Corp. (MSFT  -  Free Report), Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL  -  Free Report), NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA  -  Free Report) and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD  -  Free Report). Shares of those companies rose 1.6%, 2.2%, 1% and 2.3%, respectively.Trump Administration Extends Tariff Extension Period President Donald Trump has extended the exemption period for tariffs for top U.S. allies like the European Union, Canada and Mexico. The 25% tariff on imported steel and 10% tariff on aluminum were scheduled to be imposed on the above mentioned countries on May 1.The U.S. government has extended this date by one month to June 1. During this time, the trading partners can negotiate a new agreement to avoid the levies. Notably, in March, the Trump administration imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imported from China, Russia, Japan and others countries.Meanwhile, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin’s will visit China this week to negotiate for trade related disputes. Market will closely watch this high level trade negotiation.Economic Data The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) reported that the U.S. manufacturing index for the month of April declined to 57.3 from a reading of 59.3 in March. The reading was also below the consensus estimate of 58.4.This was the lowest reading of ISM factory activity and represents the second month of declines. However, a reading of more than 50 indicates that the sector is expanding. Businesses have suffered on two fronts. First, higher input costs primarily due to imposition of tariffs on steel and aluminum and second, shortages of skilled labor and a disruption in the supply chain.Moreover, the Department of Commerce reported that construction spending for the month of March plummeted 1.7%. The consensus estimate was for an acceleration of 0.4%. February data was revised to reflect an increase of 1% from the previously reported gain of 0.1%.Stock That Made HeadlineC.H.

122,ANDV,"Marathon Petroleum Corporation (MPC  -  Free Report) recently inked a deal worth $23.3 billion to acquire its rival Andeavor (ANDV  -  Free Report), marking the biggest-ever deal by an oil refiner, in a bid to become the top independent refiner in the United States.  When the mega-acquisition deal will culminate, it is likely to give all the leading refiners a run for their money. The combined company is set to create the largest U.S. refiner in terms of refining capacity, surpassing Valero Energy Corporation (VLO  -  Free Report) that currently holds the position. The new entity will also create a nationwide refining giant in terms of market capitalization, taking over the crown from Phillips 66 (PSX  -  Free Report).Post the announcement of the deal, shares of Marathon Petroleum have declined 8% to close at $74.91 on Apr 30. It further slid almost 2.7% yesterday to close at $72.90. This reflects investors’ disappointment toward the pricey deal, considering that Marathon is paying a hefty premium for Andeavor’s shares. However, many analysts still find the premium reasonable, owing to the synergies associated with the deal and long-term opportunities it could provide.On the other hand, Andeavor’s share price rose more than 13% to close at $138.32 on Apr 30. However, shares have declined about 3.5% yesterday to stand at $133.48.Deal DetailsMarathon Petroleum has agreed to buy all the outstanding shares of Andeavor’s representing a total equity value of $23.3 billion. The deal also assumes Andeavor’s debt, thus pushing the total value of the transaction to $35.6 billion.Investors in Andeavor can choose to receive $152.27 per share in cash or 1.87 shares of Marathon Petroleum in exchange of their current shareholdings.Marathon’s bid represents 24% premium to Andeavor’s closing share price of $122.38 on Apr 27, thus valuing Andeavor at $152.27 a share.The transaction has been unanimously approved by the board of directors of both the companies. Subject to satisfactory closing conditions, along with shareholders’ consent and other regulatory approvals, the deal is set for closure in the second quarter of 2018.Post the culmination of the deal, Marathon will own 66% stake in the combined entity, while Andeavor will hold the remaining 34% interest.Deal MotiveMarathon Petroleum’s operations are focused on the Gulf Coast and Midwest while Andeavor’s refinery activities are mainly concentrated in California, the Mid-Continent and Pacific Northwest. The complementary asset base has been the key driver of the deal.The buyout will integrate the premier assets of both the companies, bolstering the scale and leadership position of the combined entity in the region. The deal will enable the companies to pool their expertise and share their best practices, thereby enhancing buying power in securing services in the region.The deal comes at an opportune time as the U.S. refiners are set to benefit from the record U.S. shale output. The combined entity also looks well positioned to capitalize from regulations to lower pollution levels from ships. Andeavor’s port assets in California along with Marathon Petroleum’s facilities in the U.S. Gulf Coast will allow the new entity to sell lower-sulfur ship fuel.Deal BenefitsThe deal expands the geographical footprint of Marathon Petroleum in attractive markets, expanding its foothold in the Permian Basin, thereby creating an enviable retail and marketing portfolio. The combined entity will have a processing capacity of more than 3 million barrels per day (bpd) at 16 refineries spread across the country, selling fuel via 7,800 branded filling stations. The deal makes the company the largest U.S. refiner and the fifth largest in the world by capacity.Additionally, the strategic acquisition is expected to lead to significant commercial, financial and operational synergies, due to the integration of asset, systems and staff. The agreement is expected to result in operational synergies of around $1 billion within the first three years. The deal is expected to be immediately accretive to Marathon Petroleum’s earnings and cash flows. Based on the forecasted cash-flow generation, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has also approved share buybacks of $5 billion.

123,ANDV,"It was a week where oil prices ended modestly down but natural gas futures tilted higher.On the news front, U.S.-based integrated major Chevron Corporation (CVX  -  Free Report) and European counterpart Royal Dutch Shell plc (RDS.A  -  Free Report) reported strong numbers, helped by rebounding commodity prices. However, world's largest publicly traded oil company Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM  -  Free Report) and France-based TOTAL S.A. (TOT  -  Free Report) came up with weaker-than-expected earnings reports despite higher oil realizations.Overall, it was a mixed week for the sector. While West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures edged down 0.4% to close at $68.10 per barrel, natural gas prices gained about 1.2% to $2.771 per million Btu (MMBtu). (See the last ‘Oil & Gas Stock Roundup’ here: Schlumberger & Halliburton's Q1, TOTAL's Acquisition & More)The oil benchmark was little changed as the upside from the possibility of United States re-imposing sanctions on Iran was more than offset by bearish EIA crude inventory numbers.Of late, crude prices have been supported by indications that the Trump administration might lead America's exit from the landmark Iran nuclear deal if the European allies do not agree to toughen the terms by May 12. The return of sanctions would put pressure on OPEC’s third-largest oil producer’s energy industry and reduce global supply.But the Iran-induced gains were overshadowed by the Energy Department's inventory release, which revealed a surprise weekly build in crude stockpiles. A rise in the oil drilling rig count – pointing to an increase in domestic output – also played spoilsport.Meanwhile, natural gas prices moved northward last week following a larger-than-expected decrease in supplies. Investors were encouraged by another unseasonal inventory drawdown that further pushed back the commencement of the injection season.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    Energy giant Exxon Mobil posted lower-than-expected earnings in first-quarter 2018, thanks to plunge in oil equivalent production, decreased refinery throughput and lower margins at the chemical business. This was partially offset by increased price realizations from liquids. To be precise, the company reported earnings of $1.09 per share, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.14.Days before the earnings release, Exxon Mobil board of directors approved a hike in the quarterly dividend. The second-quarter 2018 dividend was 82 cents per share, higher than 77 cents in the first quarter.Production averaged 3.889 million barrels of oil-equivalent per day (MMBOE/d), lower than 4.151 MMBOE/d in the year-ago quarter. Liquid production fell year over year to 2.216 million barrels per day. Moreover, natural gas production was 10.038 MMCF/d (millions of cubic feet per day), down from 10.908 MMCF/d in the year-ago quarter.During the quarter under review, Exxon Mobil generated cash flow of $9.9 billion from operations and asset divestments, marking the highest level since 2014. The energy giant returned $3.3 billion to shareholders through dividends. Capital and exploration spending rose roughly 17% year over year to almost $4.9 billion.

The company reported earnings per share of $1.90, significantly ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.45.Quarterly revenues of $37,764 million lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $38,737 on refining weakness but was up 13% year over year.Chevron’s total production of crude oil and natural gas increased 6.6% compared with last year’s corresponding period to 2,852 thousand oil-equivalent barrels per day (MBOE/d). The U.S. output rose 9.1% year over year to 733 MBOE/d but the company’s international operations (accounting for 74% of the total) was up 5.7% to 2,119 MBOE/d.Importantly, Chevron delivered a good cash flow performance this quarter – an important gauge for the oil and gas industry – with $5,043 million in cash flow from operations, up from $3,777 million a year ago.(Read more Chevron Shares Gain After Posting Big Q1 Earnings Beat)3.    Europe’s largest oil company Royal Dutch Shell reported strong first-quarter results as rebounding commodity prices and continued improvement of its integrated gas unit helped the company in coming out with better-than-expected numbers.The Hague-based Shell reported earnings per ADS (on a current cost of supplies basis, excluding items - the market’s preferred measure) of $1.28, going past the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.24. Revenues of $91,114 million also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $81,020 million.During the quarter under review, Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) Shell generated cash flow from operations of $9,427 million, returned $4,000 million to shareholders through dividends and spent $5,183 million on capital projects. Despite falling marginally from the year-ago period, the company’s resilient cash generation has helped it to cover cash dividend payments and interest. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Shell has already aborted its two-and-a half-year long scrip dividend program as cost-containment efforts and divestment strategies have paid off. Importantly, the group raked in $5,178 million in free cash flow during the first quarter. (Read more Shell's Q1 Earnings Jump on Higher Commodity Prices)4.    French supermajor TOTAL S.A. reported first-quarter 2018 operating earnings of $1.09 per share (€0.89 per share), lagging the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.12 by 2.7%. The bottom line improved 8% from the year-ago figure of $1.01 (€0.95 per share). This was due to solid operational performance, steadily decreasing manufacturing costs and new project ramp ups, boosting production.Total hydrocarbon production during the first quarter averaged a record 2,703 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day, up 5% year over year. The increase was due to higher contribution from Kashagan, Moho Nord, Fort Hills, Edradour-Glenlivet and Yamal LNG, partially offset by natural field decline and PSC price effect. Improved security condition in Libya and Nigeria also boosted production.Cash and cash equivalents as of Mar 31, 2018 were $30.09 billion, compared with $27.52 billion as of Mar 31, 2017. Net debt-to-equity ratio was 15.1% at the end of the quarter, down from 18.1% at the end of first-quarter 2017.Cost-reduction initiatives have resulted in cost savings of $3.7 billion in 2017 and the company aims to save more than $4 billion in 2018. TOTAL’s upstream production is expected to increase 6% in 2018, in sync with its objective to grow 5% per year on an average between 2016 and 2020. (Read more TOTAL Q1 Earnings Miss, Production at Record High)5.    Upstream energy player ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report) reported first-quarter 2018 adjusted earnings of 96 cents per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 74 cents. Revenues of $8,961 million steered past the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8,680 million. The strong first-quarter results were supported by higher oil and natural gas price realizations.Production from continuing operations averaged 1,269 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (MBOED) in the quarter, lower than 1,593 MBOED in the year-ago quarter. The decline was led by divestment of assets and decline of field.As of Mar 31, 2018, the company had total cash and cash equivalents of $5.2 billion and debt of $17.1 billion, with a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 36%. In the reported quarter, ConocoPhillips generated $2.4 billion in cash from operating activities. Capital expenditures and investments totaled $1.5 billion and dividends payments grossed $338 million.ConocoPhillips reiterated its 2018 capital spending at $5.5 billion. For the April-to-June quarter of this year, the company projects production in the range of 1,170-1,210 MBOED. For 2018, the company’s production projection was raised from 1,195 -1,235 MBOED to 1,200-1,240 MBOED.(Read more ConocoPhillips Beats on Q1 Earnings, Lifts Output View)Price PerformanceThe following table shows the price movement of some the major oil and gas players over the past week and during the last 6 months.CompanyLast Week Last 6 MonthsXOM-1.5%-7.3%CVX+3.5%+8%COP-1.3%+24.8%OXY+0.7%+13.8%SLB-0.2%+8.4%RIG+0.6%+18%VLO+1.1%+37.4%ANDV+3.9%+26.7%Contrary to the week’s mildly negative oil market sentiment, the Energy Select Sector SPDR – a popular way to track energy companies – generated a +0.7% return last week.

124,ANDV,"Independent oil refiner and marketer Marathon Petroleum Corporation (MPC  -  Free Report) reported weaker-than-expected first-quarter results on lower fuel margin and declining income from its retail division.

Moreover, throughput improved from 1,708 mbpd in the year-ago quarter to 1,905 mbpd.Capacity utilization, at 93%, was up from 83% in the first quarter of 2017.Speedway: Income from the Speedway retail stations totaled $95 million, down 29.6% from the year-ago period.

(MPLX  -  Free Report), a publicly-traded master limited partnership that owns, operates, develops and acquires pipelines and other midstream assets.Segment profitability was $567 million, up from $309 million in the first quarter of 2017.

125,ANDV,"In order to take advantage of the booming shale oil production, Marathon Petroleum Corp (MPC  -  Free Report) has agreed to buy rival oil refiner Andeavor (ANDV  -  Free Report) for $23.3 billion in a cash and stock or $35.6 billion including debt.Inside The DealANDV shareholders will have the option to choose 1.87 shares of MPC stock, or $152.27 in cash subject to a proration mechanism that will result in 15% of ANDV`s fully diluted shares receiving cash consideration.

128,ANDV,"It was a week where oil prices marked its highest finish in three-and-a-half years.On the news front, oilfield service majors Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB  -  Free Report) and Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report) kicked off the first-quarter energy earnings season. Both companies, apart from coming out with estimate-meeting numbers, indicated that the North American drilling market remains robust, driven by increased activity. Meanwhile, French oil giant TOTAL S.A. (TOT  -  Free Report) agreed to acquire French utility Direct Energie for $1.73 billion.Overall, it was another good week for the sector. West Texas Intermediate crude futures gained around 1.5% to close at $68.38 per barrel, while natural gas prices edged up a marginal 0.2% to $2.739 per million Btu (MMBtu). (See the last ‘Oil & Gas Stock Roundup’ here: CVX's Gorgon Expansion, MDR & NOV's Operational Updates & More)The U.S. oil benchmark recovered from President Trump’s tweet, posting a second straight weekly gain following bullish EIA crude inventory numbers and expectations that the OPEC-led group of exporters will continue with their supply cuts.The federal government’s EIA report revealed that crude inventories were down by 1.1 million barrels for the week ended Apr 13. The analysts surveyed by S&P Global Platts – the leading independent commodities and energy data provider – had expected crude stocks to go up some 625,000 barrels. Oil stockpiles have actually shrunk in 38 of the last 54 weeks and are down more than 105 million barrels in the past year – a pointer to a tightening oil market.The commodity was also supported by reports that the OPEC-Russian alliance would like production withholding pact to run beyond the scheduled closure at the end of 2018.Natural gas prices also inched up northward last week following a larger-than-expected decrease in supplies. Investors were encouraged by another unseasonal inventory drawdown that further pushed back the commencement of the injection season.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    The world’s largest oilfield services provider, Schlumberger, reported first-quarter 2018 earnings of 38 cents per share (eliminating charges and credits) - in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The bottom line rose from the year-earlier figure of 25 cents.Surge in North American directional land drilling operations and awards for Integrated Production Services (IPS) contracts supported the first-quarter results. This was offset partially by operations related to Testing Services in Qatar, Egypt and Brazil.As of Mar 31, 2018, Schlumberger had approximately $4,165 million in cash and short-term investments and $13,526 million in long-term debt. This represents a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 32.7%. In the January-to-March quarter, the company bought back 1.4 million shares.For 2018, the company projects investments of $2 billion, almost in line with the 2017 and 2016 figures. (Read more: Schlumberger Q1 Earnings Meet, Investment Plan in Place)2.    Smaller rival Halliburton reported in-line first quarter profit after robust North American drilling activity on the back of oil pricing strength were offset by problems in Venezuela and frack sand delivery delays. Halliburton’s income from continuing operations (adjusted for Venezuela write-downs) came in at 41 cents per share, same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Moreover, revenues of $5,740 million missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5,760 million.However, Halliburton joined Schlumberger in affirming increased activity in U.S. shale, driven by strong oil and gas production in response to an improving crude environment.Halliburton’s capital expenditure in the first quarter was $501 million. As of Mar 31, 2018, the company had approximately $2,332 million in cash/cash equivalents and $10,428 million in long-term debt, representing a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 55.4%.

(MDR  -  Free Report) recently announced that it will combine its operations with that of Chicago Bridge & Iron Company N.V., which is expected to close in May 2018. The news came following a dramatic chain of events wherein McDermott was approached by Norway-based offshore oil services provider Subsea 7 S.A. with an unsolicited, non-binding buyout proposal that was subject to the termination of the agreed-upon Chicago Bridge & Iron deal.Subsea 7 was interested in acquiring McDermott as it would have made the combined company the leader in subsea equipment industry, with significant expansion in market share.  McDermott's board believed that the bid from Subsea 7 was undervalued. McDermott recently provided encouraging first-quarter 2018 operational update, while reaffirming its strong guidance for the whole year. Moreover, with a strong balance sheet, the company is well positioned to benefit from the deal with Chicago Bridge & Iron in the long term.

129,ANDV,"It was a week where both oil and natural gas finished lower.On the news front, supermajor Royal Dutch Shell plc (RDS.A  -  Free Report) and upstream player SM Energy Company (SM  -  Free Report) struck separate divestment deals, while energy infrastructure provider Kinder Morgan Inc. (KMI  -  Free Report) said that it is halting most activities and associated spending on the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion project.Overall, it was a dismal week for the sector. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures lost around 4.4% to close at $62.06 per barrel, while natural gas prices fell 1.2% to $2.701 per million Btu (MMBtu). (See the last ‘Oil & Gas Stock Roundup’ here: Concho Strengthens Permian Hold, Tallgrass to Buy MLP)The U.S. oil benchmark closed in the red last week on escalating trade tensions with China and uptick in the rig count.Announcements of duties and counter duties by Washington and Beijing on a wide range of imports have led to apprehensions of a full-blown trade battle between the world’s two biggest economies. Market participants fear that the dispute could potentially hamper global growth and harm oil demand.A rise in the oil drilling rig count – pointing to a increase in domestic output – also played spoilsport. An early gauge of future activity, rigs drilling for oil in America totaled 808 in the week to Apr 6, as per the latest weekly report by Baker Hughes, a GE Company. That's much higher than the year-ago tally of 672, indicating a drilling resurgence – a big concern for oil investors.Natural gas prices also moved southward last week despite a larger-than-expected decrease in supplies. The fall was triggered by a mild weather outlook (translating into tepid demand for the fuel) amid strong production. As it is, investors are expecting near-term consumption to dip following the end of the winter heating season.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    Royal Dutch Shell recently divested its entire stake in Oman’s Mukhaizna oilfield to India’s largest oil company, Indian Oil Corporation. The European oil giant sold its entire 17% interest in the oil field to IOCL Singapore PTE Ltd — a wholly-owned subsidiary of Indian Oil — for a total consideration of $329 million.Mukhaizna oilfield, being the largest oilfield in Oman, accounts for 13% of the total oil production of 120,000 barrels per day in the nation. The deal marks the first upstream acquisition of Indian Oil in Oman that is likely to enhance its global footprint and growth opportunities in the Middle East region, along with bolstering India’s energy security.The move will help Shell proceed with its $30 billion divestment program. The deal provides the company with a major uplift in its drive to decrease debt, following the acquisition of BG Group for $47 billion. The divestment is expected to reduce the company’s cost and enhance cash flow, as well as return to capital. The deal will also help the company to upgrade and streamline its upstream portfolio.

The company did not reveal the buyers. A cumulative amount of $292.3 million is expected from the transactions. The transactions are expected to close in the second quarter of 2018, with effective date of Jan 1, 2018.The first agreement relates to the sale of remaining assets in the Williston Basin located in Divide County, ND. This comprises net acreage of about 119,400, which are primarily contiguous. It also includes net proved reserves as of year-end 2017 of 28.8 million barrels of oil equivalent (MMBoe), of which 52% are proved undeveloped. In December 2017, net production from the assets to be sold was about 6,100 Boe per day, of which 83% was oil.The second transaction is for the sale of its third-party operated assets known as Halff East located in Upton County, TX. The assets likely to be sold in Upton County comprises a 60% working interest in third-party operated assets, a net acreage of about 5,400 and 1.6 MMBoe net proved reserves as of year-end 2017, of which 0% is proved undeveloped. In December, net production from these assets was about 1,025 Boe per day, of which 72% oil.

The Government of Canada approved the Trans Mountain expansion project on Nov 29, 2016. Since then, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company is struggling with approval issues and oppositions from various groups. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The pipeline expansion has been facing antagonism from various provincial governments of British Columbia as well as municipalities, native groups and environmental activists. These emphasize the uncertainty over the key energy projects in Canada.The shortage of pipelines and rail transportations has disrupted the production schedule of the companies in Western Canada. The companies had to slow their activities due to obstruction in crude transportation. In view of this, Alberta's provincial government supports the project that has also received approval from Canada's federal government.

(CRZO  -  Free Report) to put pressure on the company, for pursuing asset sales and other strategic initiatives to buoy its staggering financials and share price. Activist Investor Kimmeridge increased its stake in Carrizo to 8.1%, reflecting a 65% jump from the previously held 4.9%. Post the development, shares of Carrizo have moved up 11.5%.Carrizo is burdened with a heavy debt pile of around $1.63 billion, which is even higher than the company’s market capitalization. Notably, the company’s debt levels witnessed a year-over-year increase of 22.5% in 2017. Carrizo currently carries a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 81.5% that limits its growth and restricts financial flexibility. The low liquidity of the company, which stands at 0.33, also raises concern over its asset-management practices, considering it as a small-cap company.  Kimmeridge wants the company to divest its assets in the Eagle Ford Shale to delever its balance sheet. The private equity company either wants Carrizo to exit entirely from its Eagle Ford Holdings for debt reduction or if not all, then part of its holdings to use the proceeds for share buyback purposes.

Per the restructuring agreement, the international offshore drilling company will witness capital injection of $1.08 billion that would comprise $880 million of secured loans and $200 million equity.SeaDrill’s restructuring plan will now have to be approved on a confirmation hearing scheduled to commence on Apr 17, 2018. Following the approval of the plan, existing shareholders will receive 1.9% stake in the post-restructuring equity.Being one of the worst sufferers of the downturn and burdened with massive debt, the company had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Sep 12 to restructure its balance sheet amid volatile oil prices.Price PerformanceThe following table shows the price movement of some the major oil and gas players over the past week and during the last 6 months.CompanyLast Week Last 6 MonthsXOM+0.3%-9%CVX+0.6%-2.4%COP-0.1%+23.2%OXY+4%+6.9%SLB-0.6%-5.1%RIG-1.8%-5.9%VLO+2.6%+24.1%ANDV+6.3%+0.2%Despite the bearish oil market sentiment, the Energy Select Sector SPDR – a popular way to track energy companies – remained essentially unchanged last week.

130,ANDV,"The Scott Pruitt-led Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is facing a backlash from farm groups and ethanol organizations after reports emerged that it granted RIN obligation waiver – typically reserved for smaller refineries – to a large downstream operator.What Are RINs?It all started in 2005 when the Congress passed the 'Energy Policy Act' to reduce America's dependence on imports, lower greenhouse gas emissions and enhance the country's energy security. The legislation, among other provisions, created a Renewable Fuel Standard (or RFS) requiring the mixing of renewable fuels (like corn ethanol or other biofuels) into gasoline and diesel.The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (or EPA) calls for a blending target known as the Renewable Volume Obligation (or RVO). For example, in 2010, EPA proposed that 12.9 billion gallons of ethanol and other biofuels be blended into gasoline and diesel. By 2017, the amount had jumped to 18.8 billion gallons and the RVO requirement for 2018 is 19.3 billion gallons.Apart from its efforts to force the use of ethanol in the domestic gasoline mix – the percentage of which has gone up from around 3% in 2005 to roughly 10% now – Congress instructed the EPA to develop a system of electronically tracking numbers that could allow the agency to check whether the assigned blending requirements were being met by the concerned parties.These 38-character tracking numbers or tradable certificates (sometimes referred to as ‘credits’) are known as RINs (Renewable Identification Numbers). Each physical gallon of renewable fuel produced/imported is assigned a RIN that follows the fuel’s journey to a blender. Post blending, RINs are separated from the blended gallons of petroleum-based fuels, and they are used as proof by obligated parties that they have complied with the federal program.A Burden on Smaller OperatorsInterestingly, the so-called RFS point-of-obligation are not the actual parties engaged in blending gasoline with ethanol or other biofuels, but refineries and gasoline-diesel importers. That means, all oil refiners – big and small – are required to shoulder the burden for mixing ethanol into gasoline, even if they do not possess the blending terminals to do so.For most of the smaller players, investing in a new ethanol blending and distribution infrastructure is not financially viable. So, the only option for them is to buy RIN credits that they require to meet the RFS standard. Most independent refiners have to purchase them from integrated majors and biofuel producers who sell their excess credits.EPA’s ‘Secret’ Exemption to Refining Giant Andeavor CriticizedPer recent media reports, the EPA granted an RFS obligation exemption for 25 oil refineries last year. While the move to award so-called ‘hardship exemptions’ is not unusual, the amount is up significantly from the 12-15 handed out in a typical year. But more than the larger-than-usual number of hardship exemptions, what raised concern was the name of Andeavor’s (ANDV  -  Free Report) three units among the beneficiaries.Under the RFS provisions, smaller refineries (producing less than 75,000 barrels per day) may apply for waivers with the agency on grounds of ‘disproportionate economic hardship.’ However, Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) Andeavor – which generated $1.5 billion in profits last year – hardly fits the bill to receive an exemption from the country's biofuel regulations, feels industry observers. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Agriculture Industry Up in ArmsThough the EPA refused to comment on the issue citing ‘confidential business information,’ the decision has angered several agriculture industry bodies who believe these waivers significantly lower the quantity of fuel to be mixed with ethanol, thereby effectively reducing the demand for biofuels in U.S. and adversely affecting domestic corn producers. Moreover, these ‘secret handouts’ basically lets the refiners get out of their obligations to blend ethanol fuels.Finally, the alleged exemption (intended for small, financially weak refiners) granted to a profitable energy giant like Andeavor has been condemned as being an unfair and illegal practice, apart from undermining the federal mandate.The agricultural groups have demanded the EPA immediately stop issuing waivers and halt reviewing any such applications that are under consideration, pending a transparent public debate.  RIN Prices TumbleThe facilities of independent refiners can process just petroleum products and not ethanol. Consequently, these entities have to either buy or build special ethanol blending terminals or purchase RINs to comply with the RFS.Originally sold for a few cents a gallon under EPA supervision, the ethanol RIN price soared to $1.50 per gallon in 2013 as an unregulated trading market emerged. Subsequently, it fell below 25 cents only to top $1-a-gallon recently. This translates into an additional operating cost of $3-4/barrel of crude processed for refiners.Now, the EPA’s decision to exempt dozens of refiners from RFS compliance has given rise to expectations about more such waivers and significant reduction in ethanol demand. This sent RIN biofuel credit prices tumbling to around 30 cents, the lowest since September 2015.In particular, the bailout of Andeavor has raised hopes that the scheme might be (or had already been) extended to large integrated energy conglomerates like Exxon (XOM  -  Free Report), Chevron (CVX  -  Free Report), as well as big independent refiners like Phillips 66 (PSX  -  Free Report).   Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?

131,ANDV,"It was a week where both oil and gas prices logged gains.On the news front, integrated majors ExxonMobil (XOM  -  Free Report) and Chevron (CVX  -  Free Report) earmarked their growth actions in respective annual analyst meetings. Meanwhile, energy explorer Hess Corporation (HES  -  Free Report) announced a new $1 billion share repurchase program.Overall, it was a good week for the sector. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures gained about 1.3% to close at $62.04 per barrel, while natural gas prices increased 1.4% to $2.732 per million Btu (MMBtu). (See the last ‘Oil & Gas Stock Roundup’ here: Marathon's Libya Sale, SeaDrill's Restructuring, Canadian Natural's Q4 & More)Oil rebounded from its mid-week slump, with the U.S. benchmark rising more than 1%. The commodity declined in earlier sessions after the Energy Department's inventory release revealed that crude stockpiles recorded another weekly build. Crude was further pressured by soaring U.S. production, wherein output rose to 10.4 million barrels per day -- the most since the EIA started maintaining weekly data in 1983.However, a strong jobs report, falling U.S. oil rig count and news of more countries likely to be excluded from Trump administration’s planned tariffs on imported steel and aluminum, helped turn things around. Oil’s recovery was further facilitated by weakness in the U.S. dollar and reduced geopolitical fears on the back of reports that President Trump has agreed to meet North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.Meanwhile, natural gas prices moved higher last week on strong demand and a supportive weather outlook.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    ExxonMobil has outlined its growth strategy, which intends to more than double earnings and cash flow from operations by 2025 based on current oil prices. Per the growth plans, the company expects earnings of $31 billion by 2025, up more than 100% from last year’s adjusted profit of $15 billion. The figure does not include the impact of U.S. tax reform and impairments.ExxonMobil has set capital spending at $24 billion for 2018, $28 billion for 2019 and $30 billion from 2023 to 2025, to meet its target to achieve high growth. However, its peers including Chevron are cutting down on spending and keeping budgets unchanged.Darren W. Woods, chairman and chief executive officer of ExxonMobil, also emphasized that the plan estimates double-digit rates of return in all three segments of ExxonMobil’s business — upstream, downstream and chemical.Overall, ExxonMobil’s growth strategy aims to fully leverage competitive advantages to boost shareholder value in three of its world-class businesses. The increased investments are expected to enhance and boost returns on capital employed to about 15% by 2025.(Read more ExxonMobil's Growth Strategies to Double Earnings by 2025)2.    Chevron recently issued a statement at its latest annual analyst day, bringing in pleasant news for its investors. The California-based supermajor highlighted its commitment toward dividend growth as its top priority. It also laid emphasis on prudent reinvestment in the business, strengthening of financials and cash flow generation. It updated its guidance related to capex, production, margins and other details along with emphasizing on its growing free cash flows.While dividend growth remains the topmost priority for management, Chevron still emphasizes the need of operational efficiency and capital discipline to strengthen its cash flows. The company now plans to spend $18-$20 billion per annum through the end of the decade versus the prior guidance of $17-$22 billion per annum.Despite the capital discipline, the supermajor forecasts a year-over-year increase in net production of 4-7% in 2018, with 2-3% output gain from the base and shale/tight oil assets. This compares with the 5% net production growth achieved by the company in 2017 on a yearly basis.Chevron also targets asset disposal worth $5-$10 billion through 2018-2020 in an attempt to exit the non-core holdings and strengthen its cash flows. The company also plans to tap strategic acquisition opportunities to streamline and high grade its portfolio, thereby increasing shareholder value. (Read more: Chevron Sets Dividend Growth & Other Priorities for 2018)3.    Hess announced a new share repurchase plan after receiving authorization from its board of directors. Through 2018, the explorer will likely buy back shares worth $1 billion. Late 2017, the company declared a $500-million stock buyback plan. The recent announcement reflects the firm’s strong commitment toward returning cash back to stockholders on a regular basis.The company foresees higher oil and gas production which when combined with healthy oil prices will likely boost cashflow. Hess added that with the new buyback program, it will not compromise with its potential to invest in key developments like Guyana and Bakken.Earlier, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company had announced that majority of its 2018 capital budget will likely get allotted toward low-cost resources in Bakken and projects located off the coast of Guyana. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Overall, with the robust business outlook, the management might think the company’s shares are undervalued and hence is the right time to boost share buyback.(Read more Hess Boosts Buyback Plan on Favorable Business Scenario)4.    Devon Energy Corp. (DVN  -  Free Report) announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement to sell the southern portion of its Barnett Shale position for $553 million. This deal is part of the company’s plan to divest more than $5 billion of its non-core assets in the next three years under its Vision 2020 initiative. The transaction is subject to customary terms and conditions and is expected to close in the second quarter of 2018.The assets, which are earmarked for monetization, are currently averaging 200 million cubic feet of gas-equivalent per day. Combined with other recent asset divestitures announced by the company, it has already announced to sell non-core assets worth $1 billion.In 2018, Devon Energy plans to lower $1.5 billion of its outstanding debt to strengthen its balance sheet and lower interest expenses. Devon Energy might utilize the sale of proceeds from Barnett Shale to lower its outstanding debt level.The strategy to divest non-core assets is actually helping Devon Energy to concentrate on its high-margin oil production region. The company will in turn utilize the cash flow to lower its existing debts levels, and work to increase shareholders’ value through share buybacks and dividend growth.

Eni will generate about $934 million from this sale.Eni currently holds 60% stake in the Shorouk concession through its subsidiary, IEOC. Other partners are Rosneft and BP plc with the respective 30% and 10% interests in the concession. The transaction’s closure is subject to fulfillment of certain standard conditions including all essential authorizations from Egyptian authorities.The super-giant gas field of Zohr is also located at the Shorouk concession, producing 400 million standard cubic feet per day. It was brought online in December 2017 within 28 months after its discovery. The yield from Zohr is expected to eventually reach the plateau by the end of 2019. In 2018, Zohr is likely to add 70,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day for Eni.The deal is in line with Eni’s dual exploration strategy, via which, the company seeks to farm out stakes in the fields it operates so as to raise cash for financing future development as well as meting out dividends.  (Read more Eni to Divest 10% in the Shorouk Concession for $934M)Price PerformanceThe following table shows the price movement of some the major oil and gas players over the past week and during the last 6 months.CompanyLast Week Last 6 MonthsXOM-0.9%-5.4%CVX+4.6%+3.8%COP+2.2%+21.9%OXY-3%+5.1%SLB+5.5%+2.5%RIG+2.2%+12.6%VLO+3.9%+32%ANDV+12.2%-3.3%In line with the week’s positive oil market sentiment, the Energy Select Sector SPDR – a popular way to track energy companies – generated a +2.7% return last week.

133,ANDV,"With erratic movements of major market indices last week, many analysts found it quite tricky to spot the prime factor behind the extreme volatility. Although The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.4% on Feb 9 after a wild week, fears of a downturn in the near future gripped the market.However, chances of a recession are negligible given record low unemployment levels and better-than-expected job additions. Favorable fourth-quarter earnings also acted as an antidote.Markets Bled Last WeekOn average, the Dow moved more than 1,000 points every day through the week. The market saw the index alter directions roughly 53 times, per The Wall Street Journal. Moreover, the weekly decline of 5.2% for the index was the steepest in more than two years.The encouraging wage growth data convinced investors of a probable spike in inflation, which might lead the central bank to raise interest rates sooner than expected. Per the Bureau of Labor Statistics, private sector workers witnessed 2.9% year-over-year wage growth in January, the highest since June 2009. The fear of impending inflation led the 10% drop in Dow from the record-high mark of Jan 26.  Chances of Recession Negligible Most analysts believe that the market was overdue for a correction and major indices might even plunge further, but that will not lead to a recession anytime soon. The signs of recession are normally reflected in indicators like GDP and employment data, and these parameters show no signs of a recession.GDP Data Solid: The nation’s GDP increased at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 2.6% in the final three months of 2017, following gains in the previous two quarters of more than 3%, per the “advance” estimate released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis. In fact, this marked the economy’s strongest stretch of growth since the expansion started in mid-2009.Notably, in the first quarter of this year, GDP might jump 5.4%, per the latest estimate of Atlanta Fed.Significant Job Addition & Low Unemployment: Per the US Labor Department report, 200,000 new non-farm payroll jobs were created in January, beating market expectations. According to a survey by Reuters, most economists were expecting an addition of 180,000 U.S. jobs.Also, the jobless rate remained at an ultra-low level of 4.1%, and workers’ hourly wages increased 2.9% year-over-year in January 2017.Favorable Q4 Earnings Dispel FearsWe are almost at the tail end of the Q4 earnings season, with 341 S&P 500 members having reported their numbers and 159 yet to report. Per the latest Earnings Preview, total earnings for all S&P 500 companies will be up 14.1% from the same period last year on 8.2% higher revenues. The expected year-over-year earnings growth for the fourth quarter is way higher than the 6.7%, 11.2% and 13.5% growth rates for 3Q17, 2Q17 and 1Q17, respectively. Moreover, we expect the index’s earnings to increase to 15.7%, 17.5% and 18.1% in 1Q18, 2Q18 and 3Q18, respectively.Which Stocks to Focus On?Given the healthy expectations for earnings, most analysts believe that the market will not be unstable for long.Picking stocks with strong fundamentals seems to be a smart option but the task can be a daunting one.This is where our VGM Score comes in handy. Here, V stands for Value, G for Growth, and M for Momentum, and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores. Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners. However, it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM Score.We have narrowed down our search to the following stocks based on a solid Zacks Rank and VGM Score. Moreover, we have chosen firms with market capitalization of more than 10 billion, as large cap stocks are comparatively stable and less volatile.All the four stocks, with a VGM Score of A, sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

134,ANDV,"The volatility in the U.S. market continues with the Dow witnessing two massive falls of 1,175 points on Monday and 1,032 points on Thursday. Although a bleeding Dow managed to recover 1.4% on Friday, the market has entered correction territory. It goes without saying that investors are still jittery with almost $2.5 trillion wiped out last week.Inflationary fears are being fueled by the specter of likely faster rate hikes this year after January jobs data showed that U.S. workers experienced their largest year-over-year wage increase since 2009. That said, this might just be a passing phase, with strong U.S. economic fundamentals and yet another robust earnings season hinting at a brighter future.While it’s too early to predict the extent of volatility over the next few days, we can say for sure that there is ample room for stocks to rebound, a reason valid enough for investors to opt for value stocks on the dip.Is the Correction Over?The Dow declined more than 1,000 points twice last week, finally slipping into correction territory. All the three key U.S. indexes registered their worst weekly decline in two years after reaching their all-time high levels on Jan 26, following an increase in inflation and higher bond yields. The Dow, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq lost 5.2%, 5.2% and 5.1%, respectively.Rising bond yields faded the appeal of stocks, especially with valuations hovering at historically high levels. A tighter labor market, strong wage growth and prospects of rise in inflation raised rate hike prospects to as early as the Fed’s upcoming March meeting, which in turn weighed on investor sentiment. A higher rate environment, optimism surrounding steady economic growth and higher inflation weighed on bond prices. However, despite significant losses experienced over the week, strong fundamentals that powered the prolonged market rally remain firmly in place. The volatility is likely to exist over the next few days but analysts and market watchers believe that this downslide is much like a short pause, one which could extend the duration of an unprecedented stretch of gains.Value Still a Concern, Rally Set to ContinueIn spite of the bloodbath and correction, we haven’t yet entered a bear market. Moreover, despite the 10% fall over last week, the picture might not be actually that gloomy. If we look at the five-year share price movement of FAANG companies, last week’s 10% fall is miniscule. While the share price of Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) has increased 516.96% in the last five years, that of Amazon.com AMZN.MX and Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) has escalated 411.4% and 130.52%, respectively. Similarly, share price of Netflix, Inc. (NFLX  -  Free Report) and Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL  -  Free Report) has shot up a respective 864.96% and 166.17%. This state of affairs also indicates that it is only natural for overvaluations concerns to prevail. Markets have enjoyed an extended run of gains and recent reverses in a way have erased completely the ground covered in the past. Additionally, a strong economy and bullish earnings performances indicate that this phase will be short-lived. Considering all these factors, it only makes sense to add attractive stocks to your portfolio on the dip. Our ChoicesThe strong fundamentals that backed an extended market rally have not been shaken by the selloff. So, it makes good sense to buy value stocks at a bargain that could prove to be valuable finds once the rally resumes. Our selection is also supported by a good Zacks Value Score and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

135,ANDV,"Andeavor (ANDV  -  Free Report) is set to release fourth-quarter 2017 results after the closing bell on Feb 15.San Antonio, TX-based downstream operator— whose peers includes Marathon Petroleum (MPC  -  Free Report), Valero Energy (VLO  -  Free Report) and Phillips 66 among others — reported a negative earnings surprise of 10.89% in the preceding quarter amid high costs along with lower retail and branded fuel margins.  However, coming to earnings surprise history, the company has a good record. The company topped estimates in three of the last four quarters with an average positive surprise of 37.8%. Andeavor Price and EPS Surprise  Andeavor Price and EPS Surprise | Andeavor Quote Which Way are Estimates Treading?Let’s look at the estimate revisions in order to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company before the earnings release.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current-quarter earnings has been revised downward by 11.7% over the last 30 days. However, it reflects growth from the year-ago quarter loss of 2 cents.Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $10,789 million compared with $6,652 million in the prior-year quarter.Factors at PlayDuring the quarter, the downstream operator completed the acquisition of Western Refining which will bolster Andeavor’s assets and enhance its geographic footprint in the prolific Permian Basin, marking double-digit earnings growth in 2018.However, for fourth-quarter 2017, the company’s refining segment is likely to impact its bottom line adversely. The recent oil price rally has not only made commodity expensive for refiners but also widened the crack spread and lowered refining margins. In fact, the company released an update of its operations few weeks back, wherein it expects its refining margins to reduce by $135 million approximately. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the gross refining margins per barrel for Mid-Continent stands at $14.59 compared with $17.27 in the prior quarter. For Pacific-Northwest, the margin is estimated to be $7.87 per barrel, reflecting a decline from $15.03 per barrel in the prior quarter.Andeavor expects to incur an operating loss of $50-$55 million in its refining segment. This reflects a massive decline from the operating income of $762 million in the prior quarter and $43 million in the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate forecasts the total refining throughput to average 1,094 thousand barrels per day (MBbl/d) compared with 1,141 MBbl/d in the prior-year quarter. However, the figure compares favorably with the 841 MBbl/d in fourth-quarter 2016.Nevertheless, the negative impact of the refining segment is expected to be partly offset by strong results from marketing and logistics segments. The company expects the operating income from the Logistics segment to be around $190-$195 million, as compared with $164 million in the prior quarter and $123 million in the year-ago quarter. Further, the company expects its marketing segment to generate an operating income of around $235-$240 million compared with $175 million and $169 million in the prior quarter and fourth-quarter 2016, respectively.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Andeavor is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is -0.19%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is $1.13 whereas the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.18.Zacks Rank: Andeavor currently sports a Zacks Rank #1. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Though a Zacks Rank #1 increases the predictive power of ESP, the company’s negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Conversely, Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions..Stock to ConsiderWhile an earnings beat looks uncertain for Andeavor, here is a firm from the same industry that you may want to consider as it has the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.EnLink Midstream (ENLC  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +8.77% and a Zacks Rank #3.

136,ANDV,"Canadian energy giant Suncor Energy Inc. (SU  -  Free Report) reported fourth-quarter 2017 operating earnings per share of 63 cents, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 55 cents. Strong refined product sales, reduced total expenses and higher crude price realizations drove the company’s earnings. In the year-ago quarter, the company posted earnings of 29 cents a share. Quarterly operating earnings came in at C$1,310 million compared with C$636 million in the year-ago quarter, reflecting an increase of 106%. Meanwhile, quarterly revenues of C$3,941 million increased from C$3,352 million in the year-ago quarter.Suncor Energy Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Suncor Energy Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Suncor Energy Inc. QuoteProductionTotal upstream production in the reported quarter was 736,400 barrels of oil equivalent per day (BOE/d), which decreased marginally from the prior-year level of 738,500 BOE/d. The decline in production was due to a drop in output from the Syncrude operations and the Exploration and Production segment.Oil Sands operations volume was 446,800 barrels per day (Bbl/d) compared with 433,400 Bbl/d in the year-ago quarter. The increase can be attributed to improved mining and extraction reliability and record Firebag production, partially offset by the lower production at MacKay River.Production from Syncrude operations was 174,400 Bbl/d compared with 187,000 Bbl/d in the year-ago quarter. The decrease was due to the lower upgrader reliability. In the quarter under review, the Syncrude upgrader reliability was 94% lower than year-ago quarter’s 102%.Suncor’s Exploration and Production segment (consisting of International and Offshore and Natural Gas segments) produced 115,200 BOE/d compared with 118,100 BOE/d in the prior-year quarter. Lower offshore production drove the company’s results, partially offset by the increased output in Libya.Notably, Suncor’s newly commissioned Hebron asset started production in this quarter, ahead of its schedule.Also, refinery utilization came in at 94% compared with 93% in the year-ago quarter.Product SalesThe company’s refined product sales of 526,800 Bbl/d increased from the prior-year quarter level of 514,800 Bbl/d owing to strong reliability at most of Suncor’s refineries. It was partially offset by the impact of Montreal refinery’s third-party power outage.ExpensesTotal expenses in the reported quarter declined to C$7,156 million from C$7,415 million in the year-ago quarter. The company’s financing expenses decreased C$225 million compared with C$532 million incurred in the year-ago quarter.  Lower exploration, depreciation and transportation expenses also lowered expenses. The results were partly offset by increased costs related to purchase of crude oil and products.Balance Sheet & Capital ExpendituresAs of Dec 31, 2017, Suncor had cash and cash equivalents of C$2,672 million and total long-term debt of C$13,372 million. The total debt-to-capitalization ratio was approximately 25.6%. The company incurred capital expenditures of C$1,444 million in the quarter under review.Dividend and Share RepurchaseSuncor returned C$526 million to shareholders through dividends and bought back C$835 million of outstanding shares in fourth-quarter 2017.Dividend HikeThe company’s board members have approved a 12.5% hike in its quarterly dividend. Suncor will now reward shareholders with a dividend of 36 cents per share. This translates to an annualized dividend of $1.44 per share. The increased dividend will be paid on Mar 26, 2018 to shareholders of record as of Mar 5.GuidanceThe full-year outlook range for E&P production is envisioned to lie within 105,000-115,000 Boe/d.  The same for Syncrude production is projected between 150,000 Bbls/d and165,000 Bbls/d.  Furthermore, the full-year outlook range for Syncrude cash operating costs anticipated to lie in the $32.50-$35.50/bbl band.For 2018, the estimated capex came in at $4.5-$5 billion.Q4 Price PerformanceIn the fourth quarter of 2017, Suncor has gained 4.8% compared with 2.3% rise of its industry.About the CompanyCalgary, Alberta-based Suncor is Canada’s premier integrated energy company.

137,ANDV,"It was a week where both oil and gas prices tallied losses.On the news front, U.S.-based integrated majors ExxonMobil Corp. (XOM  -  Free Report) and Chevron Corp. (CVX  -  Free Report) came up with weaker-than-expected earnings reports despite higher oil prices. However, their European counterpart Royal Dutch Shell plc (RDS.A  -  Free Report) bucked the trend and reported strong numbers, helped by rebounding commodity prices and cost cuts.Overall, it was a dismal week for the sector. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures lost about 1% to close at $65.45 per barrel, while natural gas prices dived more than 10% to $2.846 per million Btu (MMBtu). (See the last ‘Oil & Gas Stock Roundup’ here: Valero and Marathon Hikes Dividends, Helmerich & Payne Reports Q1)The U.S. oil benchmark recorded its second decrease in three weeks. The major culprit was the steady trend of rising domestic oil production that continues to be the biggest headwind for the market.As per EIA’s latest data, U.S. output rose by 384,000 barrels per day in November to 10.038 million barrels per day – the first time in nearly 50 years that oil production broke through the 10 million barrels a day threshold. This has refueled concerns that the domestic supply glut is cancelling out cuts from OPEC and its allies.Data showing the number of U.S. oil rigs climbing for a second straight week brought further downside.Meanwhile, natural gas had a forgettable week of its own following a smaller-than-expected decrease in supplies. The 99 billion cubic feet (Bcf) withdrawal was also lower than the five-year (2013-2017) average net shrinkage of 160 Bcf for the reported week.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    Energy giant ExxonMobil posted lower-than-expected results in fourth-quarter 2017, thanks to weak refinery throughput. This was partially offset by higher liquid price realizations. The company reported adjusted earnings of 88 cents per share, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.06. Also, the bottom line fell from the year-ago quarter level of 90 cents.Production averaged 3.991 million barrels of oil-equivalent per day (MMBOE/d), lower than 4.121 MMBOE/d in the year-ago quarter. Liquid production fell year over year to 2.251 million barrels per day. However, natural gas production was 10.441 MMCF/d (millions of cubic feet per day), up from 10.424 MMCF/d in the year-ago period.During the quarter under review, ExxonMobil generated cash flow of $8.8 billion from operations and asset divestments. The energy giant returned $3.3 billion to shareholders through dividends. Capital and exploration spending surged more than 100% year over year to almost $7.6 billion. (Read more ExxonMobil Misses Q4 Earnings on Lower Throughput)2.    Smaller rival Chevron reported weaker-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings after excluding the impacts of U.S. tax reform. The company reported adjusted earnings per share of 73 cents, lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.27. However, the bottom line improved significantly from the year-ago profit of 22 cents amid the recovery in oil prices and production gains.Chevron’s total production of crude oil and natural gas increased 2.7% compared with last year’s corresponding period to 2,740 thousand oil-equivalent barrels per day (MBOE/d). The U.S. output fell 1.6% year over year to 671 MBOE/d but the company’s international operations (accounting for 76% of the total) was up 4.1% to 2,069 MBOE/d.Importantly, Chevron delivered a good cash flow performance this quarter – an important gauge for the oil and gas industry – with $6,230 million in cash flow from operations, up from $3,863 million a year ago. (Read more Chevron Q4 Earnings Jump, Helped by Rising Oil Price)3.    Europe’s largest oil company Royal Dutch Shell plc reported strong fourth-quarter results on all round contribution from all its segments. In particular, rebounding commodity prices and cost cuts helped the company in coming out with better-than-expected numbers.During the quarter under review, Shell generated cash flow from operations of $7,275 million, returned $3,900 million to shareholders through dividends and spent $6,778 million on capital projects. Despite falling from the year-ago period, the company’s resilient cash generation has helped it to cover dividend payments.Shell has already aborted its two-and-a half-year long scrip dividend program as cost-containment efforts and divestment strategies have paid off. Importantly, the group raked in $6,610 million in free cash flow during the fourth quarter, up from $5,741 million a year ago.As of Dec 31, 2017, the company had $20,312 million in cash and $85,665 million in debt (including short-term debt). Net debt-to-capitalization ratio was approximately 24.8%, down from 28% a year ago following the BG Group acquisition. The improvement in the group’s debt ratio was helped by cost cuts and asset sales. (Read more Shell's Q4 Earnings Jump After Oil Prices Recover)4.    Upstream energy player ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report) reported fourth-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of 45 cents per share, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. In the prior-year quarter, the company had posted a loss of 26 cents. The fourth-quarter results were supported by higher oil and natural gas price realizations.Production from continuing operations averaged 1,256 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (MBOED) in the quarter, lower than 1,596 MBOED in the year-ago quarter. The decline was led by planned divestment of assets.As of Dec 31, 2017, the company had total cash and cash equivalents of $6.3 billion and debt of $19.7 billion, with a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 39%. In the reported quarter, ConocoPhillips generated $2.5 billion in cash from operating activities. Capital expenditures and investments totaled $1.5 billion and dividends payments grossed $319 million.ConocoPhillips got an approval from the board of directors to hike the quarterly dividend to 28.5 cents per share from 26.5 cents, representing an increase of 7.5%. The company also enhanced its share buyback program. With this, ConocoPhillips will increase share repurchases during 2018 to $2 billion from the prior projection of $1.5 billion. (Read more: ConocoPhillips Q4 Earnings Meet, Revenues Top Estimates)5.    Marathon Petroleum Corp. (MPC  -  Free Report) reported strong fourth-quarter 2017 results on higher refining margin. The Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company’s earnings per share came in at $1.05, above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.00. Earnings surged from the year-ago period's figure by 144.2%. Specifically, refining margin of $13.12 per barrel increased versus $11.31 a year ago.

The jump reflects wider crack spread leading to stronger refining margin and higher capacity utilization.In the quarter, Marathon Petroleum spent $956 million on capital programs (51% on the Midstream segment). As of Dec 31, 2017, the company had cash and cash equivalents of $3,011 million and total debt of $12,946 million, with a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 38.4%.

138,ANDV,"ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report) recently struck two deals in Alaska. The company divested its Kenai liquefied natural gas (LNG) facility to Andeavor (ANDV  -  Free Report). In another deal, ConocoPhillips acquired stake in Western North Slope of Alaska from Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (APC  -  Free Report).About the DivestmentConocoPhillips has already closed the divestiture as it transferred Kenai operations to Andeavor on Jan 31, 2018. The financial details of the deal are yet to be disclosed. With the sale of the Kenai assets, ConocoPhillips completed its retreat from the Cook Inlet region.Divestment RationaleConocoPhillips started its search for a company to divest its Kenai LNG plant toward the end of 2016. The divestiture will enable ConocoPhillips to shift its focus to North Slope region operations. Notably, ConocoPhillips is investing in new projects in the North Slope region like GMT-1 and GMT-2, which have bright future. While GMT-1 is in its final construction phase and expected to come online this year, GMT-2 awaits federal approval.Apart from concentrating on more profitable assets, the deal is also expected to strengthen ConocoPhillips' balance sheet and reduce its leverage, which is one of the best in the industry. As of Dec 31, 2017, the company had a total debt of $19.7 billion, with a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 39%.About the AcquisitionConcurrent with its fourth quarter 2017 earnings, ConocoPhillips' announced that  it will buy Anadarko Petroleum's 22% non-operating stake in the Western North Slope of Alaska and its interest in the Alpine pipeline for a cash consideration of $400 million. In 2017, production from these assets was 63 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (MBOED). The acquisition reflects ConocoPhillips’ optimism on North Slope oil prospects. The company expects the Trans Alaska Pipeline System to carry more new oil in the coming years.Price PerformanceConocoPhillips has gained 15.2% in the last year against the 14.7% fall of its industry.About ConocoPhillipsHouston, TX-based ConocoPhillips is a major global exploration and production (E&P) company with operations and activities in several countries that include the U.S., Canada, the U.K./Norway, China, Australia, offshore Timor-Leste, Indonesia, Libya, Nigeria, Algeria, Russia and Qatar. The company is involved in exploration, development and production of crude oil and natural gas worldwide.We also appreciate the company’s initiative to divest non-core assets as the explorer could use the proceeds in the lucrative Eagle Ford shale and Permian Basin. The proceeds will also help the upstream company lower debt that has accumulated owing to the persistent slump in oil for more than three years.It is to be noted that during 2017, ConocoPhillips generated $16 billion from the asset sale program. However, the company’s 2018 production guidance, which is in the range of 1,195 to 1,235 MBOED is lower than the production of 1,377 MBOED in 2017.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderConocoPhillips has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked stock in the oil and energy sector is Cabot Oil & Gas (COG  -  Free Report).  It sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Houston, TX -based Cabot is an independent energy company.

139,ANDV,"The Driehaus strategy is one of the best investment approaches for those with a high-risk appetite. Using this strategy, investors can pick momentum stocks, in order to get great returns. Richard Driehaus formulated this strategy using the buy high and sell higher principle, which eventually helped him secure a place in Barron’s All-Century Team.The American Association of Individual Investors (AAII) proved that the strategy has the potential to offer high returns. AAII’s portfolio, which was developed following the strategy, returned 13.5% and 18.1% in the five and 10-year time frames, respectively, compared with -1.1% and 4.2% returns registered by the S&P 500. Thus, investors with a high risk appetite might give the Driehaus strategy a thought to boost returns.A Brief Note on Driehaus’ StrategyRegarding the strategy, Driehaus once said: “I would much rather invest in a stock that’s increasing in price and take the risk that it may begin to decline than invest in a stock that’s already in a decline and try to guess when it will turn around.” In keeping with his insight, AAII took into account the percentage 50-day moving average as one of the key criteria before designing a portfolio.It is calculated by dividing the numerator (month-end price minus 50-day moving average of month-end price) by the 50-day moving average of the month-end price. Another momentum indicator – positive relative strength – has also been included. A positive percentage 50-day moving average indicates that the stock is trading at a price higher than its 50-day moving average level, indicating an uptrend.Moreover, AAII found that Driehaus primarily focused on strong earnings growth rates and impressive earnings projections to pick potential outperformers. Companies with a strong history of beating estimates are also given importance in this strategy, which was made to provide better returns over the long term.Screening Parameters Our research shows that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 (Buy) and a Momentum Score of A or B offer the best upside potential.• Zacks Rank equal to #1 (Only Strong Buy-rated stocks can get through.

140,ANDV,"Delek Logistics Partners, LP (DKL  -  Free Report) announced an increase in quarterly cash distribution for fourth-quarter 2017 to 72.5 cents per limited partner unit, or $2.90 per limited partner unit on an annualized basis. This distribution represents a 1.4% increase from the distribution for third-quarter 2017 of 71.5 cents per limited partner unit ($2.86 per limited partner unit annualized). The fourth-quarter 2017 cash distribution is payable on Feb 12, 2018 to unit holders of record on Feb 2, 2018.The increase additionally marks a 6.6% increase over Delek Logistics’ distribution for fourth-quarter 2016 of 68 cents per limited partner unit ($2.72 per limited partner unit annualized).What led to the Move?The partnership boasts steady cash flow and balance sheet position. Notably, the partnership’s distributable cash flow was pegged at $21.6 million in third-quarter 2017 compared with $19.1 million in third-quarter 2016. The steady cash flow position must have prompted the partnership to increase quarterly distribution for the 20th consecutive quarter since its IPO.As such, the partnership’s decision to raise cash distributions reflects its aim to return a higher value to unitholders compared with previous quarters. Per the management’s opinion, the current financial flexibility and balance sheet position are expected to aid management to increase quarterly distribution by atleast 10% annually through 2019.Price MovementIn the last three months, shares of Delek Logistics have gained 18.1%, underperforming the industry’s growth of 18.3%.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderDelek Logistics currently carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Some better-ranked stocks from the sector include Cloud Peak Energy Inc (CLD  -  Free Report) and Continental Resources, Inc.

141,ANDV,"It was a week where the price of oil rallied to a three-year high. However, natural gas futures were down sharply.On the news front, energy explorer Hess Corporation (HES  -  Free Report) announced a major oil discovery offshore Guyana, while Brazil’s Petrobras (PBR  -  Free Report) agreed to shell out $2.95 billion to resolve a U.S. shareholder lawsuit over a graft scandal.Overall, the sector started 2018 on a mixed note. While West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures gained about 1.7% to close at $61.41 per barrel, natural gas prices fell 5.4% to $2.795 per million Btu (MMBtu). (See the last ‘Oil & Gas Stock Roundup’ here: Crude's Bullish Year End, SandRidge's Deal Cancellation & More)Building on its second annual gain in a row, oil prices saw a solid start to the New Year. The first week of 2018 saw U.S. oil benchmark attain its highest closing since December 2014. The major catalyst was the Energy Department's inventory release, which revealed that crude stockpiles recorded another higher-than-expected weekly draw.On a further bullish note, political turmoil in Iran has raised the specter of production disruption in OPEC’s third-biggest producer. Data showing the number of U.S. oil rigs falling for a second straight week helped cement those gains.Oil stockpiles have shrunk in 31 of the last 39 weeks and are down almost 109 million barrels since April. The gradual fall has helped the U.S. crude market shift from year-over-year storage surplus to a deficit. At 424.5 million barrels, current crude supplies are 11.4% below the year-ago period and the lowest since 2014.Meanwhile, natural gas – one of 2017’s worst-performing commodities – registered another drop following a below-average decrease in supplies. Forecasts of an end to the harsh cold snap and the resultant dip in heating demand added to the bearish sentiment, bringing prices down sharply.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    Hess announced that the sixth oil discovery — Ranger-1 exploration well — since 2015 in the Stabroek Block, offshore Guyana, was a success.The five world class discoveries in the block — Liza, Payara, Snoek, Liza Deep and Turbot —are projected to have total recoverable resources of over 3.2 billion barrels of oil equivalent. Further, resources related with the Ranger-1 discovery will raise this estimate.The drilling of the Ranger-1 well was started by partner ExxonMobil Corporation’s associate Esso Exploration and Production Guyana Ltd. on Nov 5, 2017. It hit about 230 feet (70 meters) of high-quality, oil-bearing carbonate reservoir. The well was drilled to a total depth of 21,161 feet (6,450 meters) in water depth of 8,973 feet (2,735 meters). ExxonMobil, the operator of Stabroek Block, holds 45%, while Hess and CNOOC Nexen Petroleum Guyana Limited hold 30% and 25%, respectively.The discovery further validates the significant potential of Guyana. This is likely to attract other oil giants to boost financial returns and create significant value for shareholders. (Read more Hess Discovers Oil in Stabroek Block, Offshore Guyana)2.    Petrobras, which has been reeling under severe graft and corruption charges, recently agreed to pay $2.95 billion to settle class-action lawsuits filed by investors. The payout marks the biggest such payment in the United States by a foreign entity and one of the largest securities class action settlements in the U.S. history. The settlement seeks to put to rest one of Brazil's most notorious cases of fraud.The Brazilian oil giant was at the heart of the massive corruption scandal -- dubbed ""Operation Carwash"" -- which incriminated other industries like banks, construction firms and shipyards along with high-level politicians. Various lawsuits were filed against Petrobras by shareholders to recoup losses triggered by money laundering and bribery schemes.Many senior executives of the company were accused of taking bribes for inflated contract schemes. Former Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva was also charged with corruption and sentenced to an imprisonment term of nearly 10 years. Charges were also pressed against the current President Michael Temer in May 2017, shaking the nation, following which the Brazilian Real fell hard against the dollar -- its worst since the global financial crisis in 2008.Petrobras' involvement in the multibillion dollar corruption case was a major overhang for the company which scarred its credit metrics and turned it into the world's most indebted oil company. The settlement deal comes days after Brazil's securities regulator indicted eight more executives of Petrobras including the former CEOs, Maria das Gracas Foster and Jose Sergio Gabrielli.

Financial details of the transaction have been kept under wraps. Subject to satisfactory closing conditions and regulatory approvals, the deal is set for closure by March this year.Per the deal, Andeavor will acquire Rangeland II’s assets in Midland and Delaware Basins, which include storage tanks and frac sand terminal along with 110-mile Rio Pipeline with throughput capacity of 145,000 barrels per day.Post the acquisition, Andeavor intends to integrate the crude oil infrastructure with its Conan Crude Oil Gathering System, which is currently under construction. The $225 million Conan pipeline is around 130 miles long with a capacity to transport around 250,000 barrels of oil a day.The integration of two pipeline systems will provide producers access to multiple markets and also support Andeavor's development of additional gathering systems in the area. It will also boost the commercial opportunities by providing direct access to the Midland Basin. Eventually, Andeavor intends to drop down the pipeline assets to its midstream spin-off Andeavor Logistics, LP.

The Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company had signed the divestment deal with Dansk Olieselskab AS in September 2016, which included the sale of Shell's Fredericia refinery and local trading and supply activities. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The deal was set for closure by the end of 2017, subject to satisfactory conditions. However, the deal was called off as Shell and Dansk Olieselskab could not reach a consensus regarding matters of sales within the stipulated time. As of now, Shell is not looking for other prospective buyers and intends to retain its refinery operations in Denmark.The divestment was part of the company's move to lower its debt arising from the $50 billion mega acquisition of BG Group. It was part of its portfolio optimization strategy and the $30-billion global divestment program set for the 2016-2018 period. The move was also in line with the company's aim to upgrade and streamline its portfolio.However, with Shell already closing more than $23 billion divestment deals, it remains on track to meet its target by 2018. Further, the company announced asset disposals worth around $2 billion and additional $5 billion divestment deals are already in advanced stages of talks for prospective transactions. (Read more: Shell Calls off Demark Refinery Unit Divestment Deal)5.    The board of directors of Cabot Oil & Gas Corp. (COG  -  Free Report) recently approved a 20% hike in its regular quarterly dividend. The company will now reward shareholders with a dividend of 6 cents per share compared with the previous payout of 5 cents. This translates to a dividend of 24 cents per share on an annualized basis.The increased dividend will be paid to shareholders of record on Feb 7, 2018, as of Jan 24, 2018. The company's dividend hike for the second consecutive year reflects its commitment to create value for its shareholders and underlines its confidence in generating cash. We will like to remind investors that the company’s second-quarter 2017 dividend reflected a 150% quarterly increase.Given a solid capital and liquidity position, the company is expected to continue enhancing shareholder value through efficient capital deployment activities.Cabot has recently shifted its focus on strengthening its balance sheet. On Dec 20, 2017, the company announced its decision to divest Eagle Ford Shale holdings to a unit of Venado Oil & Gas LLC for $765 million. This will help the company to concentrate on high quality Marcellus Shale assets and achieve better returns.

143,ANDV,"It was a week where both oil and gas prices lost ground.On the news front, U.S. energy major Chevron Corp. (CVX  -  Free Report) set its investment budget for 2018 at $18.3 billion, down 4% from its projected spending this year. Meanwhile, Bill Barrett Corp.  and Helmerich & Payne Inc. (HP  -  Free Report) struck separate acquisition deals.Overall, it was a dismal week for the sector. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures lost about 1.7% to close at $57.36 per barrel, while natural gas prices slumped 9.4% to $2.772 per million Btu (MMBtu). (See the last ‘Oil & Gas Stock Roundup’ here: Exxon's Restructuring, Shell's Cash Dividend Resumption & More)Notwithstanding OPEC and other major producers’ agreement to expand their output-cut deal beyond March – for another nine months to the end of 2018 – the U.S. oil benchmark dropped to its lowest settlement since Nov 16.The major culprit was the steady trend of rising domestic oil production that continues to be the biggest headwind for the market. In fact, U.S. output rose by 25,000 barrels per day last week to 9.7 million barrels per day – the most since the EIA started maintaining weekly data in 1983. A massive build in gasoline supplies also played spoilsport.Meanwhile, natural gas futures sunk to their lowest finish since Oct 27 following a surprise increase in supplies and predictions of warmer-than-normal weather (translating into weak heating gas demand) over the next few days.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    Chevron Corporation offered a glimpse of its 2018 capital spending plans.The company has set its capital and exploratory budget at $18.3 billion, down by 4% from its 2017 projected investment of less than $19 billion. Next year's budget is also around 18% lower than the company’s 2016 spending of $22.4 billion and down 46% from the 2015 expenditure of $34 billion.Revised downward for the fifth consecutive year, the second-biggest U.S. oil and gas group's cut in capital spending reflects Chevron's plans to optimize its expenses, while relying increasingly on shale drilling.Of the American multinational's total 2018 capital expenditure, a little over 86% is planned to be incurred in its upstream operations. In particular, Chevron is concentrating on increasing its investment in shale as it strives to boost its U.S. shale production next year.For 2018, the company intends to spend $4.3 billion in shale – up 70% year over year – the lion's share (or $3.3 billion) going to the lucrative Permian Basin of Texas and New Mexico alone. The remaining $1 billion has been set aside for other shale investments.Overall, the oil giant plans to shell out $6.6 billion for its domestic upstream operations. An additional $9.2 billion will target international upstream projects.

Shares of Bill Barrett further plunged 18.71% to eventually close at $4.65 on Dec 6.The Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company’s plans to issue common stock to repay Fifth Creek’s debt did not find much favor among investors. However, despite the stock dilution, the combined entity is poised for long-term growth on increased scale and synergies.

Subject to satisfactory conditions and shareholder’s approval, the transaction is set for closure by the first or second quarter of 2018.Post the acquisition, the new combined entity will be listed on the exchange under the name “New BBG” with both Bill Barrett and Fifth Creek becoming its subsidiaries. Mr. Scott Woodall, President and CEO of Bill Barrett, will continue to serve at the same positions of the combined entity.Fifth Creek will receive 100 million shares of the New BBG. Along with that, the transaction value also includes the assumption of $54 million of Fifth Creek’s debt by Bill Barrett.

The acquisition includes one proved developed producing well with production capacity of 6.5 million cubic feet per day.5.    Enbridge Inc. (ENB  -  Free Report) and Phillips 66 (PSX  -  Free Report) plan to gauge shippers’ interest in transporting significant volumes of liquid, through Gray Oak Pipeline, to the Gulf Coast market from Permian Basin of West Texas. The to-be-built pipeline’s open season has been announced on Dec 11.As per the firms’ estimates, the Gray Oak Pipeline will initially have a daily throughput capacity of 385,000 barrels. If shippers show significant interest, Phillips 66 and Enbridge will think of expanding capacity.The Gray Oak Pipeline will likely commence operations by the second half of 2019. Investors should know that the pipeline system will open access to shippers and crude producers for transporting liquid to oil refining facilities and export terminals.Price Performance The following table shows the price movement of some the major oil and gas players over the past week and during the last 6 months.CompanyLast Week Last 6 MonthsXOM-0.8%+1.1%CVX+0.8%+13.2%COP+1.4%+15.3%OXY-2.3%+13.9%SLB+1.1%-7.3%RIG-2.3%+13.3%VLO+2.3%+33.6%ANDV+5.3%+20.9% Shrugging off the week’s bearish oil market sentiment, the Energy Select Sector SPDR – a popular way to track energy companies – generated a +0.3% return last week.

144,ANDV,"Things can change very quickly in the oil market.Just a few months ago, or until September, the commodity had a very difficult year when the broader market was hitting all-time highs. In June, U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) fell to nearly $42 a barrel -- the lowest in ten months. Since then, the contract has risen about 37%. In fact, WTI hit a more than two-year high of around $59 recently.Unlike other short-lived rallies over the past three years, we believe the current higher oil prices are a result of improving fundamentals. Solid demand growth, declining inventories and the extension of OPEC-led supply cuts until the end of 2018 is helping to balance the market and support the strong uptrend.Add to this support from the pro-energy tax reform bill and the industry has not been this bullish in more than two years.Senate Passes Tax Bill: Energy Sector to BenefitIn the early hours of Dec 2, the Senate approved the biggest U.S. tax overhaul in three decades by a 51-49 vote.With the Senate clearing its version of the tax reform bill, President Donald Trump has secured his first major legislative win after more than 10 months in office. We note that the House had passed its version of the tax bill in mid-November. The $1.5 trillion tax overhaul package is expected to be enacted into law by year-end, following resolution of the differences in the two versions.The plan’s proposal to reduce the corporate income tax rate – from 35% to 20% – have been generally welcomed by corporate America, and justifiably so. The top U.S. corporate rate is 35% but it balloons to an average of almost 39% when local taxes are included -  higher than most large developed countries.The domestic oil and gas industry is one of the many beneficiaries of the sweeping tax reform.In particular, cutting the corporate tax rate and changes to cost-recovery allowances are expected to aid the energy industry to keep on ploughing back billions of dollars in the domestic economy, apart from creating new jobs to go with the 10 million the sector already employs.  Digging into the DetailsEnergy companies invest significantly for capital expenditure as the industry is capital-intensive in nature. For example, the world’s largest publicly traded oil company ExxonMobil Corp. (XOM  -  Free Report) has announced a $22 billion capital plan this year, while Chevron Corp. (CVX  -  Free Report) has set its capital spending budget for 2017 at around $20 billion.In the current scenario, capital expenditures cannot be tax-deducted in the year they are incurred. Consequently, U.S. companies need to plan judiciously regarding their capital expenditure. However, companies will be able to deduct their capital expenditures from taxable income immediately, as per the provisions of the tax reform bill. Naturally, this aspect of the bill hugely favors the oil industry and if it materializes companies in the space would be huge gainers.In the event of companies being able to deduct capital expenses in the year of their occurrence, their tax bills for the year would be lowered significantly due to higher deductions. This will leave more cash in the hands of these companies to fund their capital expenditures, acquisitions, share repurchases among others.Refiners Likely to Benefit the MostWhile there might be a number of winners within the energy sector itself, refiners seem to be the standout gainers from the overhaul of the nation’s tax code. Should the plan go through and corporate income tax lowered from 35% to 20%, refiners are likely to experience a jump in their potential earnings.This is because unlike crude producers and equipment makers who have been victims of the sustained period of stubborn low oil price environment and struggled to generate positive cash flows, refiners have been among the handful of energy subindustries that showed strength during the shaky period.The business of the downstream players is negatively correlated with crude prices. This is because the companies use oil as an input from which they derive refined petroleum products like gasoline, the prime transportation fuel in the U.S. Hence, lower the oil price, higher will be their profits. Therefore, the income from converting crude into gasoline and diesel – also known as refining margin or crack spread – has been going up over the past few quarters.Consequently, these companies – having generated positive income before taxes – are in a much better shape to take advantage of the lower corporate tax burden. Consequently, shares of the major downstream operators surged on Dec 4.    With the S&P 500 refining stock index climbing to its highest since at least 1996, it was no surprise that most participants had a field day. In fact, stocks like Andeavor (ANDV  -  Free Report) and Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) PBF Energy Inc. (PBF  -  Free Report) gained 2.4% and 2.3%, respectively, on the day. The bill, in its current form, would also benefit the likes of Phillips 66 (PSX  -  Free Report), the largest oil refiner by market capitalization and one boasting of a healthy realized margin.

145,ANDV,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Andeavor (ANDV  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Andeavor has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 20.38, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually stands slightly below the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 21.03. While Andeavor’s current PE level puts it above its midpoint of 11.49 over the past five years, it stands below the highs for the stock, thus highlighting scope for entry.Further, the stock’s PE compares favorably with the Zacks Oils - Energy sector’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 27.96. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that Andeavor has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 14.73, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for Andeavor stock in the near term too.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Andeavor has a P/S ratio of about 0.54. This is considerably lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.33 right now. This makes the stock undervalued from the P/S aspect too.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Andeavor currently has a Value Score of A, putting it into the top 20% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes Andeavor a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, the PEG ratio for Andeavor is just 0.76, a level that is lower than the industry average of 2.04. The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock’s earnings growth rate. Additionally, its P/CF ratio (another great indicator of value) comes in at 7.73, which is better than the industry average of 10.65. Clearly, ANDV is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.What About the Stock Overall?Though Andeavor might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score and Momentum Score of A each. This gives ANDV a Zacks VGM score — or its overarching fundamental grade — of A. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been quite encouraging. The current quarter and full year have seen five and three estimates go higher, respectively in the past sixty days compared to no downward revisions.This has had a meaningful impact on the consensus estimate, as the current quarter consensus estimate has surged 62% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has increased 13.7%.However, this bullish trend has likely not yet been reflected in the stock, as we have just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which indicates expectations of in-line performance in the near term. Nonetheless, the bullish analyst sentiment indicates that the stock’s prospects in the near term look good.Bottom LineAndeavor is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. So, it might pay for value investors to delve deeper into the company’s prospects, as fundamentals indicate that this stock could be a compelling pick.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of All                 Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce """"the world's first trillionaires,"""" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.

146,ANDV,"It was a week where the price of oil spiked to its highest settlement since June 2015, while natural gas futures rose to a five-month peak.On the news front, France-based integrated major TOTAL S.A. (TOT  -  Free Report) agreed to buy liquefied natural gas assets from utility company Engie for around $1.5 billion. Meanwhile, downstream operator Andeavor (ANDV  -  Free Report) and Canadian natural gas firm Encana Corp. (ECA  -  Free Report) came up with weaker-than-expected earnings reports.Overall, it was a good week for the sector. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures gained about 2.3% to close at $56.74 per barrel, while natural gas prices jumped 7.7% to $3.213 per million Btu (MMBtu). (See the last ‘Oil & Gas Stock Roundup’ here: Shell, EOG, Concho Report Strong Q3)The U.S. oil benchmark rallied on expectations that OPEC and other major producers will agree to expand their output-cut deal beyond March when they meet at the end of the month. The agreement, already renewed once, keeps 1.8 million barrels a day off the market in an attempt to clear a supply glut.Further support came from the U.S. Energy Department's inventory release, which showed steep declines in domestic gasoline and distillate inventories.Political turmoil in Saudi Arabia, where the kingdom’s 32-year old crown price – Mohammed bin Salman – ordered the arrest of much of the country’s top leadership, was also bullish for oil prices.Meanwhile, natural gas futures logged a big gain following strong power burn consumption from residential/commercial customers. Despite the commodity’s Lower 48 production being at its highest level on record, colder-than-normal weather forecasts over the next two weeks are expected to drive natural gas demand.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    French energy giant TOTAL S.A. announced that it has entered into a definite agreement to acquire the upstream liquefied natural gas (LNG) assets of compatriot gas utility Engie for $1.49 billion. The decision to buy the assets and expand footprint in the LNG business is expected to benefit the company significantly.Per the agreement, TOTAL will have control over Engie’s interest in the Cameron LNG project in the United States, long-term LNG sales and purchase agreements, and an LNG tanker fleet. It will also have access to regasification capacities in Europe. TOTAL might pay another $550 million to Engie, subject to improvement in oil markets in the coming year. This transaction is expected to close by mid-2018.This deal, scheduled to be closed in 2018, will expand TOTAL’s total volume of LNG sales to 40 million tons per year in 2020. So, the decision to acquire Engie’s assets will expand TOTAL’s operation in LNG and increase revenue contribution from this space. (Read more: TOTAL to Acquire LNG Assets From Engie for $1.49B)2.    Independent refiner and marketer Andeavor reported third-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings from continuing operations of $2.70 per share, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.03. A 24% decline in Retail and Branded fuel margins and increased operating expenses resulted in the earnings miss.The bottom line, however, increased from the year-ago quarter figure of $1.43 per share on strong performance of the refining segment. Refining margin increased 66.2% year over year to $15.09 per barrel. Region-wise, refining margin was up almost 44.7% to $13.37 per barrel in California, 109.6% to $15.03 in the Pacific Northwest and about 57.9% to $17.27 in Mid-Continent on a year-over-year basis.Andeavor expects throughput level for the fourth quarter between 1,070 MBbl/d and 1,125 MBbl/d. Region wise, California expects throughput volumes between 520 and 545 MBbl/d. Pacific Northwest and Mid Continent expects throughput levels within 165–175 MBbl/d and 385–405 MBbl/d, respectively.

Further, the bottom line declined from 4 cents per share reported in the year-ago quarter. Lower production adversely impacted results.Quarterly natural gas production declined approximately 29% year over year to 939 million cubic feet per day, while liquids production rose 9% year over year to 127.5 thousand barrels per day. Total production declined 16% to 284 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (MBOE/d).Revenues of $861 million, however, beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $827 million due to a rise in realized commodity prices. However, revenues were 12.1% lower than the prior-year figure of $979 million.Encana's realized natural gas price was $2.23 per thousand cubic feet, up 10.4% from the year-ago quarter level of $2.02. Meanwhile, liquids price rose marginally to $41.86 per barrel from $41.82 in the third quarter of 2016.

148,ANDV,"It was a week where the price of oil spiked to its highest mark in more than two years and natural gas futures rose marginally.On the news front, integrated major Royal Dutch Shell plc (RDS.A  -  Free Report), as well as Permian-focused upstream oil and gas explorers –  EOG Resources Inc. (EOG  -  Free Report) and Concho Resources Inc. (CXO  -  Free Report) – came up with stronger-than-expected earnings reports, driven by higher commodity prices.Overall, it was a good week for the sector. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures gained about 3.2% to close at $55.64 per barrel, while natural gas prices edged up 0.7% to $2.984 per million Btu (MMBtu). (See the last ‘Oil & Gas Stock Roundup’ here: Exxon, Chevron, TOTAL Report Strong Q3.)The U.S. oil benchmark rallied to its highest settlement since July 2015 on expectations that OPEC and other major producers will agree to expand their output-cut deal beyond March. The agreement, already renewed once, keeps 1.8 million barrels a day off the market in an attempt to clear a supply glut.Further support came from the U.S. Energy Department's inventory release, which showed steep declines in domestic gasoline and distillate inventories, apart from a bigger-than-expected fall in domestic crude supplies.Upbeat U.S. economic data sets and signs of recovery in global demand growth was also bullish for oil prices.Meanwhile, natural gas futures logged a small gain following an in-line increase in supplies. Favorable weather forecasts and strength in the commodity’s demand provided further upside.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    Europe’s largest oil company Royal Dutch Shell reported strong third-quarter results on all round contribution from all its segments. In particular, rebounding commodity prices and cost cuts helped the Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company come out with better-than-expected numbers. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.During the quarter under review, Shell generated cash flow from operations of $7,582 million, returned $4,000 million to shareholders through dividends and spent $5,742 million on capital projects. Despite falling from the year-ago period, the company’s resilient cash generation has helped it to cover dividend payments. Importantly, the group raked in $3,670 million in free cash flow during the third quarter, up from $3,324 million a year ago.As of Sep 30, 2017, the company had $20,699 million in cash and $88,356 million in debt (including short-term debt). Net debt-to-capitalization ratio was approximately 25.4%, down from 29.2% a year ago following the BG Group acquisition. The improvement in the group’s debt ratio was helped by cost cuts and asset sales (worth more than $26 billion since 2016). (Read more: Shell's Q3 Earnings Beat Amid Higher Oil, Cost Cuts.)2.    Upstream energy company EOG Resources reported third-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of 19 cents, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 10 cents supported by higher oil equivalent production and increased commodity price realizations. The bottom line also compared favorably with the year-ago quarter loss of 40 cents per share.In the quarter, EOG Resources’ total volume improved 7.6% year over year to 55 million barrels of oil equivalent (MMBoe). Average price realization for crude oil and condensates rose 10.3% year over year to $48.11 a barrel. Quarterly NGL prices also improved 50% year over year from $14.92 to $22.38 per barrel. Natural gas was sold at $2.19 per thousand cubic feet (Mcf), up 12.3% year over year.The company expects crude oil equivalent volumes in the fourth quarter of 2017 to be in the range of 328.1-662.2 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day. Capital expenditure for the fourth quarter is expected to lie within $3,000-$3,350 million.Along with the strong results, the company announced that it has added two premium crude acreages to its portfolio with net resource potential of 750 million barrels of oil equivalent. (Read more EOG Resources Q3 Earnings Gain on Increased Volumes.)3.    Permian-focused energy explorer Concho Resourcesreported strong third-quarter revenues and earnings results on the back of higher commodity price realizations and robust production growth.Concho Resources' average quarterly volume increased 26% year over year to 193.2 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (exceeding the high end of the company’s guidance range), of which 62% was liquids. Daily oil output was up 31% to 119.6 thousand barrels, while natural gas production came in at 441.6 million cubic feet (up 19%).The average realized natural gas price jumped 31% from the year-ago quarter to $3.18 per thousand cubic feet, while average oil price realization increased 9.1% to $45.29 per barrel. Overall, the company fetched $35.29 per barrel as against $30.61 a year back.The company expects production growth above the high end of its annual guidance range of 24-26%, with oil output growth expected to exceed 27%. The company has provided fourth quarter net production guidance of 200-204 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day. Capital expenditures for 2017 are estimated to be between $1,600 million and $1,800 million. (Read more Concho Resources Tops Q3 Earnings & Sales Estimates)4.    U.S. energy firm Apache Corp. (APA  -  Free Report) reported third-quarter earnings per share – excluding one-time items – of 4 cents, versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate for a loss of 5 cents. The bottom line also turned around from the year-ago adjusted loss of 3 cents. The outperformance stems from higher oil and gas realizations, and lower cost.The average realized crude oil price during the third quarter was $49.34 per barrel, representing an increase of 11.3% from the year-ago realization of $44.35. Moreover, the average realized natural gas price during the September quarter of 2017 was $2.75 per thousand cubic feet (Mcf), up 6.2% from the year-ago period.Apache’s third quarter lease operating expenses totaled $358 million, down 6.3% from the year-ago quarter. Moreover, total costs and expenses fell 36.7% from the third quarter of 2016 to $1,482 million.During the oil rout, Apache aligned its spending plans with the low-price environment. But Apache is now looking to increase its capital investment after achieving cost rationalization.

(Read more Apache Posts Q3 Earnings on Oil Rebound, Cost Cuts)5.    Chinese oil and gas giant PetroChina Company Limited (PTR  -  Free Report) announced third-quarter 2017 earnings of RMB 4,690 million or RMB 0.03 per diluted share, compared with RMB 1,200 million or RMB 0.01 per diluted share a year earlier. The positive comparisons can be primarily attributable to higher oil prices and strict cost control, which helped its biggest unit — exploration and production — to swing to profitability.Average realized crude oil price during the first nine months of 2017 was $48.76 per barrel, representing a 36.2% jump from the year-ago period. Further, natural gas price rose 8.6% year-over-year to $5.07 per thousand cubic feet (Mcf). This helped PetroChina’s upstream (or exploration & production) achieve an operating income of RMB 10,983 million — turning around from the year-ago operating loss of RMB 3,949 million. A tight leash on oil and gas lifting costs that decreased 1.9% from the same period last year, also helped results.As of Sep 30, 2017, PetroChina’s cash balance was RMB 169,469 million, while net cash flow from operating activities was RMB 244,295 million for the first three quarters of this year. Capital expenditure for the period was RMB 124,552 million, 9.1% higher than the year-ago level.

After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for ANDV in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $3.25 per share for ANDV, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.05 per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for ANDV, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +6.38% heading into earnings season.Tesoro Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Tesoro Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Tesoro Corporation QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market.

150,ANDV,"Independent oil refiner and marketer Andeavor (ANDV  -  Free Report) is set to release third-quarter 2017 results after the closing bell on Nov 8.San Antonio, TX-based downstream operator Andeavor — which counts Marathon Petroleum Corporation (MPC  -  Free Report), Valero Energy Corporation (VLO  -  Free Report) and Phillips 66 (PSX  -  Free Report) among its peers — posted a positive earnings surprise of 20.25% in the preceding quarter on significant contribution from the logistics and refining segments.  Coming to earnings surprise history, the company has an impressive record. The company has topped estimates in each of the last four quarters with an average positive surprise of 40.70%.Which Way Are the Estimates Headed?Let’s take a look at the estimate revisions in order to get a clear picture of analyst opinion on the stock before the earnings release.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.05 for third-quarter earnings has been revised upward by 13.4% over the last 30 days. Further, the earnings estimates for the current year have also moved up by 3 cents at $6.82.These surging earnings estimate revisions signal promising prospects about Andeavor. Andeavor Price and EPS Surprise  Andeavor Price and EPS Surprise | Andeavor Quote Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model also shows that Andeavor is likely to beat earnings because it has the right combination of two key ingredients.Zacks ESP: Andeavor’s Earnings ESP is +6.38%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at $3.25, higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.05. A favorable ESP serves as a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.    Zacks Rank: Valero currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1, 2 (Buy) or 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings estimates.Conversely, Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.The combination of Valero’s favorable Zacks Rank and a positive ESP makes us reasonably optimistic of an earnings beat.Factors at PlayApart from bolstering its network of assets, downstream operator Western Refining’s buyout is likely to help Andeavor enhance its geographic footprint in the prolific Permian Basin, driving double-digit earnings growth in 2018.Andeavor expects throughput level for the third quarter between 1,090 MBbl/d and 1,145 MBbl/d. This is higher than the 873 MBbl/d recorded in the year-ago quarter and 893 MBbl/d recorded in the prior quarter. With throughput set to be higher, we expect the company to report solid quarterly results.Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $11,629 million for the third quarter, up 77.7% and 48.2% from the year-ago and prior quarter respectively.During the quarter, Andeavor strengthened its geographical foothold and began operations in Mexico with the opening of the first ARCO gas station in Tijuana. The development is likely to contribute to earnings and provide long-term growth opportunities.We also appreciate the company’s strong balance sheet with high liquidity and low leverage ratios.The positive factors are also reflected in the share price of Andeavor which rallied 10.2% during the quarter. Further, year-to-date, shares of the company have rose 26% compared the 7% gain recorded by the industry.Wall Street’s Next Amazon Zacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

152,ANDV,"Noble Corporation plc (NE  -  Free Report) is expected to report third-quarter 2017 earnings results on Nov 2, after the market closes.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 6.06%. In the last four quarters, Noble delivered an average negative surprise of 7.58%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement. Noble Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Noble Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Noble Corporation Quote Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Noble will beat estimates this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is pegged at -6.89%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate stands at a loss of 38 cents, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at a loss of 35 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Noble currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.Please note that the Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.  Factors Likely to Influence This QuarterNoble is a leading offshore drilling firm with a robust portfolio of assets. Though the industry has witnessed a setback in the past few months, the company is likely to be less impacted by it than its peers. This is because Noble enjoys a strong backlog position with $3.2 billion.Moreover, Noble has been able to significantly reduce expenses related to oil and gas production activities during second quarter of 2017. The success on this front reflects the company’s consistent efficiency gains and cost-reduction initiatives and should prove favorable in third-quarter earnings.The company’s price chart is unimpressive. Shares of the company have underperformed the industry, quarter to date. Noble’s shares have declined 10.9%, while the market indices have decreased 6.7%.However, the offshore drilling industry is witnessing rig oversupply. This is a cause for concern for the likes of Noble as an increase in rig count may hamper contract flow and dayrates. In addition, major oil companies are lowering deep-water capital spending, thereby worsening the situation. Stocks to Consider    Here are some firms that you may want to consider on the basis of our model. These have the right combination of elements to beat earnings this quarter.Denbury Resources Inc (DNR  -  Free Report), based in Plano, TX, is engaged in the exploration, production and development of natural gas properties in the Gulf Coast region.

Also, for the last four quarters, Pioneer Natural’s average positive surprise was 46.74%.Which Way Are the Estimates Headed?Let’s take a look at the estimate revision trend in order to get a clear picture of analyst opinion on the stock before the earnings release.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of 29 cents for third-quarter earnings has been revised upward over the last 30 days, with eight firms being bullish and five firms taking a bearish stance. The consensus estimate reflects a year-over-year improvement of 120.8%.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Pioneer Natural is likely to beat earnings because it has the right combination of two key ingredients.    Zacks ESP: Pioneer Natural’s Earnings ESP is +2.77%. A favorable ESP serves as a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.      Zacks Rank: Pioneer Natural currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 has a significantly higher chance of beating earnings estimates.  Conversely, Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.The combination of Pioneer Natural’s Zacks Rank #3 and +2.77% ESP makes us reasonably optimistic of an earnings beat.  What’s Driving the Better-than-Expected Earnings?On Oct 12, Pioneer Natural announced that its total production came in at 275.7 thousand barrels oil equivalent per day (MBOE/D) in the third quarter, representing an increase of 6.4% sequentially and 15.4% year over year. Higher activities in the Wolfcamp and Spraberry plays of Permian Basin primarily supported the upside. However, total output failed to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 278 MBOE/D, thanks to lower activities in the Raton basin.Along with the production update, Pioneer Natural reported realized crude and natural gas prices of $45.35 per barrel and $2.58 per thousand cubic feet, respectively. The reported prices for both the commodities are higher than year-ago quarter.Given the higher production and commodity price realizations, we expect the company to solid third-quarter numbers.Q3 Price OutperformanceDuring the quarter, Pioneer Natural lost 7.5%, underperforming the industry’s 5.1% gain.  Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are some other companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Denbury Resources Inc.
