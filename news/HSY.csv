0,HSY,"For Milton Hershey, mother knew best.Long before he founded Hershey Chocolate Co., today called simply Hershey Co. (HSY), he had hardly any means and little schooling.What he had was a mom, Veronica, telling him to avoid the path of his dad, Henry, who despite an inquiring mind failed to follow through.""When I left home, my mother had given me some advice I never forgot. 'Milton,' she said, 'now that you're going out in the world alone, my best advice to you is, when you tackle a job, stick to it until you have won the battle,'"" Hershey told Success magazine in 1927.He heard her.Even after early slips as a confectioner, Hershey dug in. His mother's advice ""came in handiest when my (second) business failed in New York. I wouldn't give up caramel manufacturing even then. . .. After some more hard sledding, things began to move, and before long I was selling caramels faster than I could make them.""By the time of the third venture, the Lancaster Caramel Co. he founded in 1886, Hershey had hit the sweet spot. He started shipping milk caramels throughout America and Europe and soon employed 1,400 people. That gave him enough money to make semisweet and milk chocolate — and to launch his famous company in 1894.All In The TasteThanks in part to that motherly advice, Hershey (1857-1945) put a premium on customer service and quality. ""Mr. Hershey never liked paper advertising — in the newspapers,"" Abe Heilman, a superintendent at Hershey's plant, said in a 1953 interview. ""He believed the product should sell itself. Mr. Hershey said, 'Give them quality; that's the best advertising in the world.'""A motto that hung over Hershey's desk read, ""Business is a matter of human service.""Hershey Co., in the Pennsylvania town named for him, remains a top manufacturer of chocolate and related products and an iconic brand name. Revenue in 2012 was $7 billion for its maze of products, which include candy bars, Kisses and Reese's peanut butter cups — and the Hershey stock has tripled since 2009.During Hershey's reign, sales rocketed from $600,000 in 1901 to $71 million — worth $900 million today — in 1945, the year he died.In the process, he became one of America's wealthiest, leaving an estate of $900,000 — worth $11.5 million in today's money — and his philanthropic endeavors live on with his city and school. ""I am trying to build here a place where people can be happy and contented while they work and live in pleasant surroundings,"" he said in 1927.Hershey's recipe for satisfying America's sweet tooth? ""I have always worked hard, lived rather simply and tried to give every man a square deal,"" he said in 1938. ""That's why, perhaps, I've been in business so long — 62 years. You can't cheat and lie and steal and continue to keep in business.""Michael D'Antonio, author of ""Hershey,"" told IBD: ""Hershey's determination and self-confidence were his strongest personal traits. As a manager/owner he was quite open about his intentions, his concerns, his affections and his dreams. I think the fact that he talked about his vision for his company and his community ... made people feel they were part of something bigger than mere profit-making: the higher purpose of serving society.""Born in Derry Church, Pa., Hershey had to quit school early so he could work to help his family. He was apprenticed to a printer in 1871, but didn't like the job. His mother then helped him become an apprentice to a confectioner.Hershey had found his calling.In 1876 he turned 19 and started his own candy business, setting up a shop in Philadelphia with financial help from his mom's family.But after six years, despite his hard work, the business flopped.Westward he went — to Denver, where his father was. Milton joined a confectioner who taught him how to make caramels using fresh milk. Soon Hershey was back in business for himself, this time in New York City, but that venture also went sour.He returned to Pennsylvania and regrouped, finally finding his traction with Lancaster Caramel.Hershey made it work by focusing on three points:1. Wholesale purchasing of candy products.2. Perfecting caramels.3. Marketing nationally and internationally.Once, while placing a large order with a British candy importer, he invited his banker down to inspect his company. The banker was so impressed with Hershey's drive and earnestness, he put the loan in his own name rather than risk having his boss reject the request, wrote Joel Brenner in ""The Emperors of Chocolate.""""Hershey was very persistent and didn't let failure stop him from trying again,"" said Amy Bischof, the director of the museum called the Hershey Story.What distinguished Hershey's third business try? ""He hit on an innovation — pasteurized caramels — for a market where competition wasn't as great,"" said D'Antonio. ""Second, he was nimble in response to growing demand.""Still working out of his Lancaster facility, he started Hershey Chocolate Co. as a subsidiary of his caramel company in 1894.By 1900, he was all in. Milk chocolate was considered a Swiss luxury product. He made it an American regular treat after selling his Lancaster Carmel for $1 million — worth $28 million today — and zeroing in on Hershey Chocolate.The Curious Boss""He really had a classic entrepreneurial spirit, and was always interested in looking for challenges and seeking the answers to various challenges,"" said Pamela Whitenack, director of Hershey Community Archives.He bought property for his new factory in Derry Township, Pa. The facility was able to quickly receive cocoa beans and sugar, and was surrounded by dairy farms. Working around the clock for three years, Hershey reportedly became the first American to develop a formula for manufacturing milk chocolate.In 1905 he opened his modern factory. Two years earlier he'd established the town of Hershey, 95 miles west of Philadelphia, where his employees could live.Hershey was on a role. He sold affordable chocolate bars nationally for 5 cents. Hershey's Kisses came along in 1907.His strategy was to limit his product line to making a few items perfectly. The result, wrote Brenner, was that ""by manufacturing candy bars the way Henry Ford made automobiles, Hershey brought milk chocolate to the masses.""Under his direction, Hershey, Pa., boasted attractive houses, picturesque parks and tree-lined streets. He also made sure it had top-notch schools, along with churches and a trolley system.And he helped his employees with insurance benefits and a generous retirement plan.In 1909, Hershey and his wife, Catherine, who were childless, founded the Hershey Industrial School, which served orphan boys. It was built on the old Hershey family homestead that his family was forced to sell in 1877.In 1918 he created the Hershey Trust, funded by his fortune, to be held for the Hershey Industrial School. Initially graduates were given $100, clothes and assistance in finding work. Full college scholarships were available too.Called today the Milton Hershey School, its 10,000-acre facility serves disadvantaged children from kindergarten to 12th grade.Said Bischof of Hershey: ""He was also a genuinely good person who cared for his workers and earned their respect, which in turn helped make his business successful.""

1,HSY,"CHICAGO — It seems there are few business realms where Amazon.com (AMZN) hasn't become a major player, and now the e-commerce giant is even venturing into the world of candy and snacks.Companies at the Sweets & Snacks Expo in Chicago this past week say that's not necessarily a bad thing. The rise of Amazon is likely to create both opportunities and challenges for food product manufacturers. Overall, though, it should be a net positive, especially benefiting niche and regional players.In the past 12 months ending in April, Amazon racked up about $518 million in sales of sweets and snacks. Sales in the category climbed 22% in just the past six months, said Mike Black, global vice president of marketing for e-commerce analytics firm Profitero.""Consumers can count on something almost always being available,"" Black said. ""Amazon is creating the endless shelf.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseAmazon fulfills two-thirds of snack-product orders made through its site, with one-third coming from third-party sellers on the marketplace.Shoppers have been trained to think of Amazon as the place to find an enormous selection, Black said.That has brought new challenges for companies to make their products stand out through keywords and engaging content, including photos and video, he said.Today only 3% of packaged grocery sales are done online, but it's growing rapidly, Black said.One way Amazon has helped the top brands is through its Amazon Dash program, which allows customers to instantly reorder their favorite products with the touch of a button. It has buttons for Doritos and Lay's chips from PepsiCo (PEP)-unit Frito-Lay and candy bars from Hershey (HSY), among others.Amazon's ""endless shelf"" also is a boon for regional candy and snack brands to serve customers who have moved and can no longer get those products at their local retail stores.""It is a tremendous opportunity, especially for regional companies as they look to broaden their distribution,"" said Christopher Gindlesperger, vice president of public affairs and communications for the National Confectioners Association, which sponsors the Sweets & Snacks Expo.Amazon also is a boon for startups and makers of niche products.""It's been amazing for us,"" said Michael Goldstein, a representative of Clever Cookie of Hauppauge, N.Y. Clever Cookie's Shrewd Food brand started selling protein crisps on Amazon about six months ago and sales took off, he said.""There are products out there that are healthy and high protein, but no one is making anything that provides the nutrients that tastes this good,"" he said.The Shrewd Food protein crisps come in such flavors as baked cheddar and brick-oven pizza. Plus, they have sriracha cheddar, smokehouse maple, and cookies and cream.The company also sells its crisps in Costco (COST) stores in the Northeastern U.S.But the e-commerce giant also is increasingly a competitor with its private-label brand Wickedly Prime. It currently sells Wickedly Prime chips and crisps, granola and nutrition bars, snack nuts and seeds. There's also popcorn, puffed snacks, seaweed snacks, and snack and trail mixes.Still, the growth in e-commerce sales can't be ignored.""We're seeing double-digit growth in both snacking and treating,"" said Sally Lyons Wyatt, executive vice president and practice leader at marketing consulting firm IRI.In the past year, online sales of popcorn are up 68%. Non-chocolate candy up 61% and salty snacks are up 46%, she said. Categories seeing over 30% growth include chocolate candy, gum and dried meat snacks.RELATED:Trump Personally Lobbied Postmaster To Hike Amazon's Rates: ReportAmazon Stock Touches Record High After Obliterating Earnings ViewsAmazon Stock Quotes, Company News And Chart Analysis

9,HSY,"The candy and snack food industries are doing well right now, based on statistics released Tuesday at the Sweets and Snacks Expo. But you wouldn't know that from the share prices of publicly traded companies in the sector.""Consumer staples in general are extremely out of favor,"" Edward Jones analyst Brittany Weissman said. ""Consumer staples have significantly underperformed the broader market.""IBD's confectionery industry group ranks near the bottom of 197 industry groups. It includes just four stocks: Mondelez International (MDLZ), Hershey (HSY), Tootsie Roll Industries (TR) and Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory (RMCF).Many makers of sweets and snacks are in IBD's packaged-food industry group, which ranks No. 161. It includes 29 stocks, among them Nestle (NSRGY), PepsiCo (PEP), General Mills (GIS), Kellogg (K), ConAgra Brands (CAG) and Hostess Brands (TWNK).Investors started rotating out of food stocks in mid-2016 in anticipation of rising interest rates, Weissman said.Amazon's (AMZN) acquisition of Whole Foods Market, announced in June 2017, added to the worries, she said.The Amazon-Whole Foods merger, completed in August 2017, led to large grocery sellers like Walmart (WMT) and Kroger (KR) gaining more negotiating power with manufacturers, she said. That's made it harder for food makers to pass on cost increases, such as rising grain and cocoa prices.Another factor hitting major candy and snack makers has been the rise of store brands. They include Kirkland Signature at Costco Wholesale (COST), Member's Mark at Walmart-owned Sam's Club and Wickedly Prime at Amazon.To combat these private-label products, the major candy and snack companies are focusing on product innovation to attract consumers. They're using new ingredients, different combinations, bold flavors and novel textures to entice customers.Many of these new products were on display at the annual Sweets and Snacks Expo, which ran Tuesday through Thursday in Chicago. The show had about 900 exhibiting companies and was expected to attract about 18,000 attendees.This year's Sweets and Snacks Expo is the biggest yet in terms of number of exhibitors and attendees, said Christopher Gindlesperger, vice president of public affairs and communications for the National Confectioners Association, which sponsors the show.Product trends among candy makers at this year's show include greater use of coconut and caramel in products, Gindlesperger said.Cocoa and chocolate producer Barry Callebaut is promoting its new ruby chocolate at the trade show. Introduced last September, it is the fourth type of chocolate after milk, dark and white. Made from the ruby cocoa bean, the pink chocolate has a ""berry-fruitness and luscious smoothness,"" the Swiss firm said in a press release.Candy sales in the U.S. are expected to reach $25.3 billion in 2018, up from $24.9 billion in 2017, marketing and consulting firm IRI said at the show.Snack sales are seen hitting $42.5 billion in 2018, up from $41.1 billion in 2017.""Consumers are still snacking,"" said Sally Lyons-Wyatt, executive vice president at IRI. ""On average consumers are snacking over 2.5 times a day. Younger consumers actually snack more than that.""Top growing categories in snacks include protein, fiber and energy snacks, she said. Consumers are also shifting more to crisps not made from potato or corn, she said. Consumers enjoy variety and are trying chips made from chickpeas, lentils, quinoa and other ingredients.Food companies are targeting millennials by offering products in smaller portion sizes suitable for snacking.""It seems like almost anything can be a snack right now,"" Edward Jones' Weissman said. ""You change the portion size and suddenly it's a snack. Everybody is focused on snacks. Yogurt went from breakfast to a snack. It's a much more crowded marketplace.""RELATED:Amazon Widens Its Influence Even More And Takes A Bite Out Of SnacksCampbell, Hershey, Humana Lead Frenzy Of Year-End M&A Activity

13,HSY,"While merger discussions roil the food industry, Mondelez International (MDLZ) is doing its best to increase sales on its own.The company is introducing a new line of crackers and snack bars made without artificial ingredients and GMOs, and it's revamping some of its existing products to better appeal to millennials. The rollout is Mondelez's biggest since it was created by splitting with Kraft Foods in 2012.The maker of Oreo cookies and Triscuits, which has posted declining sales the past three years, is renovating its portfolio as consumers increasingly demand less-processed snacks. The new products, called Vea, were developed in-house by a ""startup"" team — a sign the food giant is trying to be more entrepreneurial.Vea arrives as traditional packaged-food companies have been gobbling up upstart brands in response to the changing tastes, and as Kraft Heinz's (KHC) freshly abandoned courtship of Unilever (UL) (UN) raises the prospect of bigger realignments in the industry.IBD'S TAKE: Mondelez shares rose sharply Tuesday, retaking their 50-day line on revived hopes that Kraft or another company might make a takeover bid. Mondelez has generated profit growth even as revenue falls, much like Kraft and some of its peers. How long can the snacks giant rely on cost cuts and other margin-boosting moves without topline growth?Tim Cofer, Mondelez's chief growth officer, said the Deerfield, Ill.-based company considered making an acquisition but ultimately decided to develop the new food line itself.""There was nothing out there that hit this space as well as what we developed,"" he said. Shares ended the day up nearly 6% to 44.97.The Vea products are slated to reach shelves across the U.S. in July, and they will eventually be expanded to overseas markets — where the company generates most of its revenue. Mondelez also is removing genetically modified organisms from Triscuits and will tout that the crackers are made from just three ingredients.Mondelez's profit margins have lagged behind competitors, and the company is under activist pressure to improve its performance. Chief Executive Irene Rosenfeld has been cutting costs to boost results, but the strong dollar has battered the company, which generates more than 70% of its sales outside North America.Last year, Mondelez made a failed bid for Hershey (HSY), an attempt to crack the U.S. chocolate market. The merger approach was also seen as a defensive move: By bulking up, Mondelez would be less of a takeover target itself.Kraft Heinz, which was formed when Kraft Foods merged with Heinz in 2015, made a $143 billion takeover bid for Unilever last week, but formally pulled the offer after it was rejected. Mondelez has been seen as a possible target of Kraft Heinz as well.Ultimately, companies have to figure out a way to increase sales if they want to keep investors happy, said Asit Sharma, an analyst at the Motley Fool.""Investors understand that cost-cutting and productivity initiatives have a limited shelf-life in boosting earnings,"" he said. ""Sooner or later, revenue growth will be top of mind for investors.""RELATED:Kraft Heinz, Unilever Fall After Bid Nixed, But Deal Buzz Continues

Kraft had fallen 4.2% on Thursday following its latest earnings report.But Unilever — the parent of brands such as Dove, Vaseline and Q-tips — said that the offer ""fundamentally undervalues"" the company and provides no financial or strategic merit for Unilever shareholders, according to a statement acquired by Reuters.""Unilever does not see the basis for any further discussions,"" it said.Shares of Unilever NV jumped 15.3% to 48.79, setting an all-time high. Unilever PLC (UL) popped 14% to 48.53, just below a record level.RBC Capital Markets analyst David Palmer pondered whether ""Unilever's focus on sustainability might make it very resistant to any further approach from Kraft,"" and believes Kraft Heinz ""will  likely need to raise its offer substantially if it hopes to change the outcome.""According to Bloomberg data, a Kraft Heinz-Unilever would have made for the second-biggest food and beverage company in the world behind Nestle. Kraft Heinz is currently the fifth-largest food and drink conglomerate in the world after Kraft and Heinz merged in 2015.Meanwhile, Mondelez International (MDLZ) shares fell 1.6%.

22,HSY,"Emmanuel Faber's first big move as Danone's chief, the $10 billion takeover of WhiteWave Foods (WWAV), is a foray into soy milk, protein shakes and kale aimed at kickstarting growth at the French yogurt maker grappling with a drop in dairy consumption.The Paris-based producer of Actimel drinks and Evian bottled water agreed to buy the U.S. company for $56.25 a share in cash, acquiring leadership in the burgeoning natural and organic food sector through its biggest acquisition in almost a decade.After spending his first year trying to revive sluggish sales in Danone's core European dairy segment, Faber is now expanding his portfolio to include a broad range of faster-growing, higher-margin items like the Silk brand soy beverage, cashew milk and soy yogurts that cater to more affluent and health-conscious consumers. The agreement is a victory for Douglas L. Braunstein and James C. Woolery, former JPMorgan Chase (JPM) bankers, who prodded WhiteWave to consider a sale through their investment fund.""The purchase will allow us to double the size of our U.S. business and become the world leader in organic,"" Faber, who joined Danone in 1997 and became CEO in October 2014, said on a conference call with journalists.WhiteWave soared 19.8% to $56.80 in trading before U.S. exchanges opened on the stock market today. Danone jumped 3.9% to 65.76 euros at 1 p.m. in Paris.IBD'S TAKE: WhiteWave shares were breaking out of an 11-month base before the Danone takeover bid. But it's only rated No. 4 in its industry group. Find out who the leaders are in the IBD Stock Checkup.The acquisition would make Danone the global leader in fresh dairy and health-food brands including Horizon milk, Wallaby Organic yogurt and Earthbound Farm packaged salads as consumers increasingly shun processed foods perceived as unhealthy. The deal is the second potential takeover in the food industry in recent weeks, following the Mondelez International (MDLZ) advance towards Hershey (HSY), which the chocolate maker snubbed. Both of those deals aim to beef up the acquirer's presence in the U.S.In recent years, dairy milk's reputation as nature's perfect food has suffered as consumers question its nutritional merits as well as the environmental costs and treatment of animals housed at big industrial farms. The U.S. organic-food market expanded 11% in 2015 to $43 billion, while the overall food industry grew 3.3%, according to the Organic Trade Association.Unit sales in Danone's fresh-dairy business have fallen for two years straight, weighed down by a slump in Brazil and declining demand in Russia and Europe.""The key question to our mind is the real strength of the WhiteWave brands,"" wrote Jeff Stent, an analyst at Exane BNP Paribas. ""To what extent has WhiteWave's success been less about the brands and more about first-mover advantage in a high-growth category. Time will tell.""Denver-based WhiteWave began trading in 2012 after U.S. dairy company Dean Foods (DF) spun off the unit, which was its most profitable business. Investors have speculated since then that the company would become an acquisition target.Sales at  WhiteWave will increase about 11% this year, based on the average of analyst estimates, after doubling since 2010 on rising demand for more healthful beverages and food, data compiled by Bloomberg show. North America accounted for 86% of the company's $3.9 billion in revenue last year, with Europe contributing the rest.Growth like that doesn't come cheap -- Danone is paying about 26.2 times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization for WhiteWave, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That's well above the median multiple of 14.8 times earnings paid by buyers in acquisitions of dairy companies over the past five years, the data show.The WhiteWave purchase, to be funded through debt, will boost results in the first year after closing, the maker of Activia yogurt said. Danone expects a $300 million boost to operating profit by 2020.Danone, which makes Oikos Greek-style yogurt, is targeting sales growth of more than 5% by 2020, with half of its business keying in on consumers seeking healthy-eating alternatives. North American sales will be 22% of Danone's total revenue after the purchase, compared with 12% now.The purchase values WhiteWave at $12.5 billion including net debt and other liabilities. The companies expect to complete the deal this year. Lazard Ltd. advised Danone, while Goldman Sachs Group Inc. advised WhiteWave.Braunstein and Woolery announced in February that their firm, Hudson Executive Capital LP, had bought shares in six companies, including WhiteWave, with an eye to nudging them to take steps that would boost their stock prices. The investors said they wouldn't pursue proxy fights or publicly berate companies, preferring ""constructive engagement.""

23,HSY,"In the background of another epic bounce for U.S. stocks was the bull market's oldest friend: buybacks.American companies announced $52 billion of repurchases last week alone, following the Federal Reserve's approval of capital plans for 33 financial firms, according to data compiled by Birinyi Associates. That pushed total buybacks in June to more than $65 billion, the most since February.The cascade of announcements came as the S&P 500 Index was erasing a loss that swelled to more than 5% after the U.K. voted to exit the European Union.The Fed's vote of confidence in the ability of U.S. banks to withstand a severe economic shock cleared the way for large firms from Morgan Stanley (MS) to Bank of America (BAC) to outline planned share repurchases last week. Buybacks have been a primary source of buoyancy for the second-longest bull market in history -- a pillar of strength that the Fed has been happy to fuel with dovish monetary policy.""It was helpful to the market in the wake of Brexit that all those announcements came last week,"" said John Carey, a Boston-based fund manager at Pioneer Investment Management, which oversees about $230 billion. ""The central bank has signaled that they'll do what they can to support markets by continuing to supply cheap credit and bond-purchasing activity.""Resurgent buybacks may help ease or even erase a falloff earlier in the year. Through the first four months of 2016, announced repurchases were down 38% from a year ago.The S&P 500 slipped 3.6% on June 24, the first day of trading after the U.K. voted to leave the EU. That Friday loss marked its biggest daily decline since August. The benchmark index fell another 1.8% the following Monday before reversing course and rising in four straight sessions to end the week. The gauge's 5.1% increase over the period got it back within 0.5% of where it was before the Brexit referendum.Financial shares had the most at stake in the Fed's stress tests, and when the central bank gave the all-clear last Wednesday, they surged on the news. An index of financial stocks in the S&P 500 climbed 3.9% across the following two days.IBD's Take: Shares of JPMorgan, Bank of America, Citigroup, Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are all trading below their 50-day and 200-day moving averages.  All have reported declining earnings in some recent quarters as sluggish economic growth and flat yield curves weigh on results.JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) announced $10.6 billion in buybacks, the most out of any financial firm last week, according to Birinyi Associates data. Citigroup (C) authorized $8.6 billion in repurchases, while Bank of America and Morgan Stanley said they'll buy back more than $3.5 billion each.The U.S. stock recovery last week also received a boost from investors closing bearish options bets they'd made heading into the Brexit decision. Short sales had reached the highest since the financial crisis amid the uncertainty leading up to the referendum. The S&P 500 also got a lift from deal activity, as Mondelez International (MDLZ) bid $23 billion for Hershey (HSY) on Thursday.Still, U.S. stocks are going to need alternative sources of strength going forward, like improved growth for both profits and the overall economy, according to Carey. The S&P 500 is expected to see earnings contraction of 5.4% for the second quarter, according to a survey conducted by Bloomberg.""We're seeing some steps that could prop up the U.S. market in the near-term,"" said Carey. ""At some point we're going to need economic growth and improving earnings to keep the market going higher.""

27,HSY,"Politicians and policymakers continued to deal with the ramifications of the U.K.'s decision to vote to leave the European Union, but investors shrugged off ""Brexit"" with stocks enjoying solid gains. Big banks such as JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC) and Citigroup (C) hiked payouts after the Federal Reserve OK'd their capital plans in the second round of stress tests. Nike (NKE) ran ahead despite a sales stumble, the finance arm of General Electric (GE) is no longer ""too big too fail."" Tesla Motors (TSLA) faces a regulatory probe while Volkswagen (VLKAY) paid a hefty price to settle an investigation.Stocks started the week as they finished the prior week -- falling sharply in reaction to the Brexit vote. But financial markets roared back, with the S&P 500, Nasdaq and Dow industrials all up more than 3% for the week and above key support levels, helped by Bank of England signals Thursday that it would ease further this summer. Notable breakouts included NetEase (NTES) and Lockheed Martin (LMT).Thirty-one of the 33 biggest banks on Wednesday passed the second round of the Fed's annual stress tests, the industry's equivalent to final exams, clearing their plans to hike buybacks or dividends. The U.S. subsidiaries of Deutsche Bank (DB) and Banco Santander (SAN) were the only ones that failed the second half of the tests, which gauges whether banks' capital and shareholder-return plans would hold up in a downturn and evaluates banks' abilities to assess their own financial planning. The Fed passed Morgan Stanley (MS) on condition that it fix risk-management weaknesses and resubmit its capital plan – the financial forecast that banks submit to the Fed for the tests – by Dec. 29. But Morgan, along with Bank of America, JPMorgan and Citigroup, all announced bulked-up capital-return plans shortly after results were released.Wednesday's results follow the first round of the stress-test results during the prior week. All 33 banks passed that round.JPMorgan rose 2.8%, but failed to end the week above its 200-day line. Morgan Stanley climbed 5.7%. Deutsche Bank slid 5.5%, setting fresh record lows.The finance arm of General Electric is no longer deemed ""systemically important,"" according to the Financial Stability Oversight Council, ending the GE Capital ""too big to fail"" listing. With the ruling, GE will no longer have to follow minimum capital and liquidity requirements outlined in the Dodd-Frank Act. The nonbank Systemically Important Financial Institution (SIFI) label was put on GE Capital in 2013. But since then General Electric has slashed GE Capital assets as it refocuses on its industrial core.GE shares rose 5.6% to 31.49, near a 32.15 buy point.The ISM manufacturing index rose 1.9 points in June to 53.2, its best reading in 15 months. The new orders and production subindexes showed solid gains. The employment measure rose 1.2 points to 50.4, the first positive reading of 2016. The export orders gauge rose to its best level since late 2014.

But sales slightly missed views with a 6% gain to $8.24 billion, the third straight quarter to miss revenue estimates. Currency-neutral global futures orders rose 11%, below estimates. Nike sees high-single-digit reported revenue growth in fiscal 2017. Q1 guidance disappointed.

Lions Gate fell 3.9% to 19.45, while Starz jumped 3.35% to 29.67.Hershey (HSY): The chocolate giant rejected an unsolicited $107-a-share bid from snacks giant Mondelez (MDLZ), saying it sees no basis for further talks.

Last year's Prime Day was the biggest single-day shopping sale in Amazon's history and helped drive Prime memberships, even though many shoppers and analysts said the actual deals weren't that great.Wal-Mart, apparently in a pre-emptive strike against Amazon, announced it was offering a 30-day trial membership of its Prime-comparable ShippingPass, which also offers free two-day shipping. The membership fees are half that of Prime membership.Amazon shares rose 3.8%, Wal-Mart 1.2%.Alcoholic beverage maker Constellation Brands (STZ) reported a 50% per-share earnings bump to $1.55, while revenue rose 15% to $1.87 billion, topping Street views on both the top and bottom lines.

28,HSY,"So Twitter (TWTR) both beats and misses at the same time.......posting softer user growth - 320 mil avg monthly users vs. the expectation of 324 mil users - while also offering guidance that was less than upbeat.....BUT - they did beat on the top line - Revenues were $569 mil vs. exp of $559.6 mil.... the stock traded off 13% in after hours trading...but look....they had taken the stock up 30% off the lows of Oct 2 (the same day that they announced the appointment of Jack Dorsey as CEO) at $24.34.....so now they gave back 10% on this 'miss'.......so net net...the stock is still up 18% from those lows....was this is a classic 'buy the rumor/sell the fact' reaction? I mean it seems that Twitter always misses on user growth, so what's the big deal?
"
29,HSY," Now Apple  (AAPL) on the other hand - BEAT, BEAT, and slightly missed.... Beat on earnings, beat on revenue, but missed on IPhones sales targets - ..expectation was that they would sell 48.5 million units and they ONLY sold 48.05 mil units - Can you believe that? They ONLY sold 48.05 mil units! But even that still represents a 22% y/y increase in growth!.... So? What's the fuss? Now analysts pay very close attn to the 'units sold' to see if Apple can continue to grow this number - but the concern is - Will Apple become a victim of its own success? 
"
30,HSY,"The stock traded up $3 in afterhours trading or 2%. and is currently trading at $116.56 in the early morning session..... Now look - They have taken the stock up 12% from the Oct lows of $107.31.....Last week when the chatter started about a possible miss - they gave back 3.5% and churned there until today.....So - net net - the stock is still up 8% for the month....Now that is all well and good if you bought the stock on Oct 2.. but if you bought it on the 23rd...then yeah....You are NOT really happy.....But hey - trading is not for the faint of heart.... 
"
31,HSY,"Yesterday - for the most part traders continued to avoid making any big commitments ahead of today's FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee) monetary policy announcement.....Yesterday's action was a 'repeat' of the muted action on Monday as traders and investors really just sat on the sidelines...waiting and waiting.. 
"
32,HSY,"Now the broader mkt essentially traded flat, but the transportation index (otherwise known as the 'Trannies') got hammered. (The Dow Transport Index is an index of 20 US transportation stocks....Airlines, truckers, rails etc... all stocks that are directly connected to the transportation of goods) Now why would this be so? A couple of reasons that all suggest a building global slowdown...... 
"
33,HSY,"1. Yesterday's eco data - Durable Goods report - was not encouraging at all - it showed a continuing decline in durable goods orders for another month. Durable goods orders slid by 1.2% in September following a revised 3.0% decline in August. If we take out transportation equipment - durable goods orders still fell by 0.4% in September after declining by 0.9% in August. (Durable Goods are those goods that are not quickly consumed or replaced often - so think of appliances, cars, computers, home or office furnishings etc...) 
"
34,HSY,"2. Consumer confidence showed a sharp retreat in September 3. Continued oil weakness So taken together - these data points indicate that a slowdown and loss of confidence and means less goods will be shipped. And if companies are shipping less goods then it makes sense that the trannies get hammered. And they did...the index was off 2.6% or 218 pts. Small caps also took it on the chin...and why? Because if investors believe that a recession or slowdown is on the horizon - they would rather put their money in 'Value Stocks - defined as 'large, safer, dividend paying American Blue Chips vs. the risk of small cap 'growth stocks'. So today is FED day...as if you didn't know that.....and stocks will remain in this holding pattern until precisely 2 pm.....(or maybe 1:59:30 if you 'BUY' access to the headlines before they actually hit the tape....but that is another story for another day...). 
"
35,HSY,"The FED is not expected to change a thing.....rates will remain at zero....but do expect strategists and analysts to pull apart the statement 'word by word' looking for any clue as to FUTURE policy actions.....Really? Look - global stocks have been propelled higher because the ECB (European Central Bank) and the PBoC (Peoples Bank of China) launched additional stimulus - so now the only question is - Will Janet join in the party and serve up more Kool Aid? And if so - the stocks look relatively cheap in zero interest rate environment.....and cheap means a bargain and a bargain means that buyers will come in - at least for today.... Rue the day that all this free money just stops..... But let's not go there right now.... 
"
36,HSY,"Overnight in Asia - mkts were mostly lower.....volumes were light as investors await the FED action.......continued weakness in commodities - oil, copper etc keeping the lid on...... Japan was the standout - rising by 0.68% as many await the BoJ (Bank of Japan) policy announcement next week. The expectation is that they will announce MORE KOOL AID for everyone! In Europe - mkts are all a bit higher....because they believe that the FED will do nothing and if so - then stocks will rally..... couple that with some good earnings and it's off to the races! FTSE +0.39%, CAC 40 +0.34%, DAX +0.64%, EUROSTOXX + 0.61%, SPAIN +0.32% and ITALY +0.88%. US futures are up 4 pts in early trading.... finding support yesterday at 2060 which is also the , now flattening out, 200 dma.......If we hold here then a surge up to 2100 is not out of the question at all.....if the mkt becomes disappointed with what they hear out of the FED then the a move back to the 2035 level would not be a surprise at all..... 
"
37,HSY,"The focus is not about today...but about the future moves that the FED will make and that will depend upon how they position today's policy statement.... In the end though, I do not expect rates to rise in 2015 at all. They have successfully kicked that can into the 1Q of 2016..... Earnings today include: Hershey (HSY), General Dynamics (GD), International Paper (IP), Occidental Petroleum (OXY), Valero Energy (VLO) , and the owner of the NYSE - Intercontinental Exchange (ICE).

39,HSY,"A rising dollar, insolvency in Greece, economic sanctions on Russia and a stock market sell-off are weighing on an already slowing Chinese economy.

76,HSY,"Harry Burnett Reese had a sweet tooth for his business.The candy that bears his name is iconic — and delicious.An extraterrestrial named E.T. greatly enjoyed Reese's Pieces during his 1982 visit here.Milton Hershey, founder of his own candy empire, offered a Fortune magazine reporter who was doing a cover story on him in the early 1940s a box of Reese's Peanut Butter Cups as his gift. Reese bought the chocolate needed from the Hershey company.""Take these delicious treats home for your wife and family,"" Hershey said, as quoted by Andrew Reese, an H.B. grandson and author of the 2008 book ""Reese's Peanut Butter Cups: The Untold Story.""In 2012, according to Advertising Age and Euromonitor International, the Reese's brand was the No. 1 ranked candy in America, with annual sales of $2.6 billion. Globally, it stood at No. 4.That was just the way H.B. envisioned his company. ""If you make a product that both young and old enjoy, then your potential customers are limited only by the number of people on earth,"" he said.The CharmOn his third attempt to make good in the confection business, Reese (1879-1956) founded H.B. Reese Candy in 1923, the year he turned 44.Five years later, he invented Reese's Peanut Butter Cups.His firm and Hershey (HSY) merged in 1963. Reese's six sons received Hershey common stock valued at $23.5 million. The annual cash dividends alone add up to $31 million today.""H.B. Reese was able to envision how to operationalize his business; he actively searched for better ways to automate his manufacturing processes and improve the quality of his products,"" Andrew Reese told IBD. ""Over the years, many family members shared their stories of how they assisted him with testing his ideas with prototype devices that improved things like packaging and more.""There were many obstacles over the decades that could have derailed H.B. Reese. He did not let the Great Depression, world wars, sugar rationing and more deter him from pushing his company's business growth forward.""Born on a farm near Muddy Creek Forks, Pa., H.B. was ambitious as a kid. He worked the land and milked cows, dairy-operation skills that would come in handy.He even built a pond and expanded into raising frogs — and sold them to restaurants.He enjoyed music and mastered the French horn, playing in a local band in his late teens.By age 21 he was a married man, saying vows with the love of his life, Blanche Hyson. They would have 16 children.It helped that she came from a well-to-do family. ""The support H.B. received from his father-in-law played a big part in his family's early survival,"" Andrew wrote.After rotating between farming and managing his father-in-law's fishing business, Reese found his calling in 1916.He came upon a newspaper ad by Milton Hershey, who wanted people to operate dairy farms that helped create his milk chocolate.Reese had the experience and was hired by Hershey himself.The two got to know each other and began a lifelong friendship. When Reese learned that Hershey made $75 a minute, the younger man thought of starting his own candy business.Reese's first foray was with R&R Candy in 1919.He manufactured high-grade candy, chocolate almonds and raisins in a plant in Hummelstown, Pa., near the city of Hershey's famed chocolate factory.In order to get high-quality equipment, Reese raised money by issuing stock in a second newly formed business, Superior Chocolate & Confectionery.By May 1920 he'd raised today's equivalent of $290,000, but ultimately the business failed.From there, Reese worked a series of jobs, including at a paper mill and as a butcher. On the side, he canned vegetables.His father-in-law, Robert Hyson, bought a home for the Reese family in Hershey to help out.There, Reese went back to work for Milton Hershey.H.B.'s good work again earned him a promotion — to foreman at the Hershey plant.With Reese's family expanding even more, he restarted his candy business ambitions. He made confections in the basement of his house while working for Hershey and buying chocolate from him.""Hershey was sympathetic toward the young family man and wanted to encourage him,"" Andrew wrote. ""He took a liking to H.B., possibly because he saw how hard the man worked and that he was persistent in his efforts to do his best.""Sweet TimesBy 1923, business was good enough that H.B. Reese Candy was incorporated.Three years later, H.B. was doing well enough in Hershey to build his first factory and buy a huge home.Reese marketed his candy in specially made boxes. He made sure to make the sweets with real cocoa butter, cream, fresh grated coconut and freshly roasted peanuts.In 1927 came another big turning point. A commercial customer told Reese that he was having trouble keeping supplied with chocolate-covered peanut butter candy. He'd been buying the item from a supplier who couldn't keep up.""He asked H.B. if he could supply him with something like that,"" Andrew wrote. ""H.B. saw an opportunity and, with considerable persistence, seized it.""Reese quickly created a unique taste with his peanut butter cups.But when he bought new roasting machines for the peanuts, the taste suddenly went awry. He soon realized that the old machines had malfunctioned just enough to burn the peanuts just right.""Amused but challenged, H.B. and his crew immediately set out to duplicate the old roasting flavor,"" wrote Andrew, who also supplied this tidbit: ""One other ingredient must remain a mystery. Many competitors have tried to duplicate the Reese's Peanut Butter Cups, but their product sales did not take off. We can only reveal that the flavor of the peanut butter and the type of milk chocolate used make all the difference; further details are secret.""Wrote Andrew: ""Reese's Peanut Butter Cups would eventually become one of the most widely recognized candies in the world.""Solo DirectionReese first sold the peanut butter candy as part of an assortment. Then one of his salesmen said the special sweets would sell on their own, and the boss was convinced.During the Great Depression of the 1930s, Reese gained and gave.Since he sold his candy on consignment, he wouldn't be paid until the product sold, so cash flow could be a problem. Once, he had no money for chocolate and was turned down for credit by the Hershey company. Milton Hershey intervened and directed that Reese be supplied on faith and trust.A sign on a phone pole outside Reese's home said that the homeless and hoboes were welcome to eat there. Reese also offered employment to anyone seeking work.""In general, H.B. was a good-natured man and was friendly toward everyone; he rarely held a grudge,"" Andrew wrote.By 1935, H.B.'s company had 62 employees, in addition to his six sons, working at the factory.Driving the business were the peanut butter cups, packaged in 120 pieces per box and sold for a penny per cup. Customers were department stores and other venues.Andrew notes that with the country in economic trouble before World War II, chocolate was considered a luxury, and yet demand for Reese's products was solid.H.B. created such a positive work environment — paying his employees more than the going rate — that they voted not to unionize.""He built a fishing lodge and had a boat that he made available to his factory workers for a very small fee,"" Andrew said. ""H.B. Reese helped those around him, and in return these same people bent over backward to help him out.""Another grandson, Brad Reese, notes that the announcement made by the company upon H.B.'s death gave insight to what made him such a landmark businessman.It read in part: ""His utter devotion, his indomitable will and his amazing energy have been a constant guide and inspiration.""

77,HSY,"Chocolate and candy maker Hershey (HSY) grew sales 7% in each of the past two years.While growth investors are probably turning the page right now, income investors familiar with Hershey might see things differently for two reasons.First, Hershey surpassed 7% revenue growth only once in the past 14 years. In 2005, Hershey's sales advanced 9%, the faster growth due mainly to acquisitions, new products and price increases.Analysts expect revenue to grow 8% in 2012.Second, Hershey's revenue picture in the most recent quarter was encouraging. Sales expanded 11%. At the earnings call in April, Chief Financial Officer Humberto Alfonso said first-quarter international sales, excluding Canada, grew about 20%.Last year, international sales accounted for about 16% of total sales. Hershey sees an opportunity to grow internationally, and that is starting to prove lucrative.The company, a member of the IBD Big Cap 20, is particularly focused on growing sales in China, Brazil and Mexico. In those three countries, Q1 net sales also increased about 20%.Hershey's EPS grew 15%, 18% and 11% in the past three years. The Street expects a 13% pop this year.In Q1, earnings leapt 32%, the best growth in the past eight quarters.After-tax margin was 12.7% in Q1, the best in at least 17 quarters.Pretax margin was 16.4% last year, the best in five years. Hershey increased prices 9.8% in 2011, which helped margins and sales.Return on equity was 74%, partly due to the company's debt.The dividend yield is about 2%. The payout has more than doubled since the first half of 2003. The recessionary 2009 was the only year in almost four decades that the dividend was not increased.Recently, the company said its goal is to reach $10 billion in sales by 2017. The target implies an annual growth rate of almost 9% for six years.Hershey will report second-quarter results July 26. The Street expects earnings to rise 9% on 7% revenue growth. In the first quarter, the company topped the Street's EPS consensus by about 19%.

80,HSY,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for The Hershey Company (HSY  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 1.7% in that time frame.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is HSY due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.First-Quarter 2018 Results Hershey’s first-quarter 2018 adjusted earnings came in line with analysts’ expectation, while revenues beat the same. Growth in core chocolate brands and the acquisition of Amplify worked in favor of the company. However, cost pressures weighed on margins.Earnings & Revenue DiscussionAdjusted earnings per share of $1.41 were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Earnings increased 8.5% from the year-ago quarter.Net sales of $1.97 billion surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.94 billion. Net sales rose 4.9% year over year, courtesy of 3.4% and 0.5% benefit to net sales from acquisitions and foreign currency translation, respectively. Organically, excluding the impact of currency, sales increased 4.4%.Volumes were up 2.4%. Meanwhile, net price realization had an unfavorable impact of 1.4%.Quarterly Segment DiscussionNorth America (the United States and Canada) net sales improved 4.4% to $1.75 billion. Currency benefited sales by 0.2%. The Amplify acquisition had a 3.8% positive impact, while volumes provided a 1.8% benefit.First-quarter net sales in the International and Other segment grew 8.8% to $220.3 million. Currency had a positive impact on sales of 2.4% and volumes provided 8.1% benefit.Constant-currency sales were solid (about 12%) in Mexico, Brazil and India. Net sales in China inched up 1% year over year.Margins DetailAdjusted gross margin declined 260 bps to 44.9% due to unfavorable sales mix, higher freight and logistics costs as well as incremental investments in trade and packaging.Cost of sales increased 2.8% to $997.9 million in the first quarter. Again, total advertising and related consumer marketing expenses fell 5.3% from first-quarter 2017. Adjusted operating margin contracted 150 bps to 21.7%.2018 GuidanceNet sales are now expected to move toward the lower end of the previous range of 5-7%. Adjusted gross margin is now expected to decline around 125 bps (in line with the 2017 projection).Savings from the Margin for Growth program are estimated between $80 million and $90 million in 2018, compared with the previous range of $55-$65 million.The company expects adjusted tax rate to be approximately 19% to 20%.The company reaffirmed its adjusted EPS guidance at $5.33-$5.43, reflecting a 14-16% increase from 2017.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates. There has been one revision higher for the current quarter compared to four lower.Hershey Company (The) Price and Consensus  Hershey Company (The) Price and Consensus | Hershey Company (The) QuoteVGM ScoresAt this time, HSY has a nice Growth Score of B, though it is lagging a lot on the momentum front with a D. The stock was allocated a grade of C on the value side, putting it in the middle 20% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of B. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Our style scores indicate that the stock is more suitable for growth investors than value investors.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. Notably, HSY has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.

81,HSY,"The Hershey Company’s (HSY  -  Free Report) cost-cutting initiatives and productivity investments have been able to mitigate weak top-line performance to a great extent. The company’s latest cost-saving program, Margin for Growth, is expected to boost profits and will be reflected in the to-be-reported quarter. As part of this multi-year program, the company will reduce workforce outside the United States by 15%. The program is intended to improve overall operating margin through supply chain optimization, a streamlined operating model and reduced administrative expenses. Savings from these initiatives will be achieved in 2018 and 2019. These initiatives will enable Hershey to achieve adjusted operating profit margin target of about 22% to 23% by 2019. The company will incur pre-tax charges of $375 million to $425 million and provide benefits between $80 million and $100 million from the layoffs. The savings from Margin for Growth program in 2018 are estimated between $80 million and $90 million, implying an increase of approximately $25 million from the initial projection. The company expects to generate cost-savings at the high end of the $150 million to $175 million target by 2019-end.Apart from cost-saving initiatives, Hershey’s foray in key global markets and increased focus on product innovation bode well.Gaining Traction in International MarketHershey is expanding its business in key global markets to bolster international presence. The company is making measured investments in core markets of Mexico, Brazil and India, where it is witnessing solid marketplace gains. Hershey is steadily activating its five core brands in these markets. Constant-currency net sales in Mexico, Brazil and India increased 12% in the first quarter of 2018 and 11% in 2017.Among the emerging countries, the company’s primary focus is on China. The country has one of the largest consumer bases considering the growing number of middle-class and affluent households. The company plans to add additional manufacturing capacity and resources to boost growth in the region. It started the implementation of the Margin for Growth Program in the second quarter of 2017 to optimize the manufacturing operations to support the China business. Constant-currency net sales were up approximately 1% in the first quarter.Focus on InnovationHershey regularly brings innovations in core brands to cater to consumers’ demand. The company strategically creates a unique and holistic portfolio for every season, which can meet consumers’ seasonal shopping needs. Hershey’s core chocolate brands, Reese's, Hershey's, Kit Kat and Kisses, continue to drive growth. Also, Hershey's Cookie Layer Crunch’s have been performing well. The company expects innovative products to help it achieve long-term net sales growth target of 2% to 4%.High Cost Hurts MarginsThe increased costs related to packaging initiatives are hurting margins. Cost hikes also include unfavorable sales mix and fixed-cost absorption of overhead given lower volumes, unexpected manufacturing variances, higher freight and distribution costs and other supply chain expenses. This is expected to weigh on margins in 2018.In the first quarter of 2018, adjusted gross margin declined 260 basis points due to unfavorable sales mix, higher freight and logistics costs as well as incremental investments in trade and packaging.Hershey Company (The) Price  Hershey Company (The) Price | Hershey Company (The) QuoteZacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderHershey carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the Zacks Consumer Staples sector are United Natural Foods, Inc (UNFI  -  Free Report), Conagra Brands Inc (CAG  -  Free Report) and Lamb Weston Holdings Inc (LW  -  Free Report), each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

82,HSY,"Kellogg Company’s (K  -  Free Report) first-quarter 2018 adjusted earnings and revenues surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Higher sales, cost-saving initiatives as well as higher contribution from the acquisitions of protein bar maker RXBAR and Brazilian food group Parati helped the company offset the industry-wide soft consumption trends for packaged food items.Earnings BeatFirst-quarter comparable earnings of $1.19 per share came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.07. The bottom line increased 11.2% year over year banking on higher business delivery, lower effective tax rate and reduced restructuring charges.Revenues BeatKellogg reported revenues of $3.4 billion, increasing 4.7% year over year. The upside can be primarily attributed to the October 2017 takeover of RXBAR, improved business delivery along with favorable currency translation. The top line outpaced the consensus mark of $3.32 billion.Currency and acquisitions had a 2.5% and 1.6% positive impact on revenues in the quarter. Accordingly, organic revenues (excluding the impact of acquisitions, dispositions and foreign exchange) were up 0.6% compared with 1.5% decline in the previous quarter. This marks the company's best performance in several quarters. Except North America, organic sales increased across all other regions.Volumes increased 2.9% in the quarter, while remaining unchanged in the preceding quarter. Meanwhile, price/mix had a 2.3% adverse impact on sales versus 1.5% negative contribution in the last reported quarter.Kellogg Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Kellogg Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Kellogg Company QuoteMargin DetailsKellogg’s adjusted gross margin (currency-neutral adjusted) in the quarter was down 120 basis points (bps) from the year-ago level.Kellogg’s operating margin (currency-neutral comparable growth) was 14.7%, reflecting an improvement of 40 bps year over year. The uptick can be attributed to higher sales benefit and strong productivity savings related to the Project K restructuring program, particularly last summer’s exit from its U.S. Snacks segment's Direct Store Delivery (DSD) system.Segment DiscussionTotal North America: Kellogg’s North America sales improved 1.8% (down 0.6% organically) from the prior-year quarter to $2.3 billion. The upside was mainly driven by the acquisition of RXBAR and favorable currency translation. However organically, sales declined owing to the impacts related to the transition out of DSD in the U.S. Snacks business as well as continued consumption softness in U.S. cereal business. Volumes increased 1.5% against a decline of 0.7% in the last reported quarter. Price/mix was down 2.1% compared with 2.6% decline in the prior reported quarter. Adjusted (comparable) operating profit grew 3.7% in the segment.Europe: The segment’s revenues of $587 million improved 14.4% and currency had a 12.2% positive impact on the same. Organically, sales were up 2.2% in the quarter compared with 3% growth in the fourth quarter. Adjusted operating profit improved 1.1% as well.Latin America: Revenues of $232 million in the segment improved 5.3% (organically, sales were up 3.3%). Price/mix, volume and currency had a 0.5%, 2.8% and 2% positive impact on sales, respectively. However, adjusted operating profit plunged 32.8% in Latin America.Asia Pacific: The segment’s revenues of $252 million improved 11% on the back of strong growth in cereals in the emerging markets and continued expansion of Pringles. Organically, sales increased 6.2%, better than 4.3% growth in the fourth quarter. While volume increased 7%, price/mix had a negative impact of 0.8% on sales. Adjusted operating profit improved 17.3% in the Asia Pacific.2018 ViewKellogg expects revenue growth to be in the range of 3-4% (versus flat growth expected earlier) on a currency-neutral basis for 2018. On an organic basis, sales are expected to decline within 1-2%, of which 1% is related to the negative impact of U.S. Snacks’ DSD transition, including its list-price adjustment and rationalization.It still anticipates adjusted earnings to grow in the range of 9-11% on constant currency.Adjusted constant-currency operating profit growth is projected within 5-7% (versus 4-6% expected earlier). Cash from operating activities is expected to increase in the band of $1.7-1.8 billion for 2018 driven by higher net income, sustained working-capital improvement and benefits from the U.S. Tax Reform.Zacks RankKellogg carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

84,HSY,"As if the heart of Q1 earnings season wasn’t informative enough, before Thursday’s opening bell we also see economic headline reads hitting the doorstep — in bulk. Durable Goods Orders, Core Capital Equipment, Advanced Trade in Goods and, of course, weekly Initial Jobless Claims numbers are all out right now, and we await impact of these figures on regular-day trading today.Jobless Claims once again ratcheted down far below our years-long range between 225K-250K, which itself is indicative of a robust domestic labor market. But this morning’s 209K is the lowest read we’ve seen since 1969, the year Neil Armstrong first set foot on the moon. This marks a precipitous drop of 24K claims from the slightly revised 233K the previous week.Continuing claims also recede to historic lows, last week reaching 1.837 million from the previous read of 1.866 million, also a very low number. In fact, we haven’t seen continuing claims get anywhere near 2 million for a week since last summer’s dual hurricanes hit the mainland. U.S. employment continues to amaze and astound.Durable Goods came in a tick higher than expected at 2.6% for March, from a strong upward revision from 3.0% to 3.5% for February. However, strip out Transportation costs and that March number plummets to 0%, with non-defense, ex-aircraft actually going negative to -0.1%. Core Capital Equipment Orders sank from a healthy 1.4% in February to 0.9% in March, with the shipments vs. orders ratio at -0.7%. So it would appear new airplane orders had completely covered this economic metric last month.The U.S. Trade Balance surprised to the upside in March to -$68 billion, lower than the -$73.4 billion analysts had been expecting and a revised -$75.9 billion in February. This is relative good news — certainly better than we’d seen earlier in the year — although it’s tough to get excited about a deficit of $68 billion.After the closing bell today, we expect quarterly earnings results from Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), Intel (INTC  -  Free Report) and Expedia (EXPE  -  Free Report), among others. But ahead of today’s open, there is such a huge amount of earnings reports hitting the tape that we’re going to keep it to just a few of the Zacks Rank Buy and Sell stocks this morning:Zacks Rank #2 (Buy)-rated CME Group (CME  -  Free Report) topped earnings estimates by a penny to $1.86 per share, on quarterly revenues that narrowly missed our $1.12 billion Zacks consensus. Revenues were still up 19% year over year, and the company booked an all-time record 22.2 million orders in the quarter. For more on CME’s earnings, click here.Chicagoland MedTech major Baxter International (BAX  -  Free Report), also a Zacks Rank #2 stock, beat on the bottom line by nearly 13% to 70 cents per share, on $2.68 billion in revenues that surpassed the $2.62 billion expected. Baxter’s Q1 strength was in its core Renal Care segment, up 4% year over year. The company also raised full-year guidance. For more on BAX’s earnings, click here.Zacks Rank #4 (Sell)-based Southwest Airlines (LUV  -  Free Report) managed to meet bottom-line estimates of 75 cents per share, though its $4.94 billion in quarterly sales missed the projected $5.02 billion. PRASM — a key airline metric — fell 1% in Q1, and guidance for PRASM in Q2 is down another 1-3%. For more on LUV’s earnings, click here.Finally, The Hershey Company (HSY  -  Free Report), a Zacks Rank #4 ahead of its Q1 earnings report, also met estimates at $1.41 per share, while topping revenue expectations by posting $1.97 billion, compared with the Zacks consensus of $1.94 billion.

85,HSY,"Thursday, April 26, 2018As if the heart of Q1 earnings season wasn’t informative enough, before Thursday’s opening bell we also see economic headline reads hitting the doorstep — in bulk. Durable Goods Orders, Core Capital Equipment, Advanced Trade in Goods and, of course, weekly Initial Jobless Claims numbers are all out right now, and we await impact of these figures on regular-day trading today.Jobless Claims once again ratcheted down far below our years-long range between 225K-250K, which itself is indicative of a robust domestic labor market. But this morning’s 209K is the lowest read we’ve seen since 1969, the year Neil Armstrong first set foot on the moon. This marks a precipitous drop of 24K claims from the slightly revised 233K the previous week.Continuing claims also recede to historic lows, last week reaching 1.837 million from the previous read of 1.866 million, also a very low number. In fact, we haven’t seen continuing claims get anywhere near 2 million for a week since last summer’s dual hurricanes hit the mainland. U.S. employment continues to amaze and astound.Durable Goods came in a tick higher than expected at 2.6% for March, from a strong upward revision from 3.0% to 3.5% for February. However, strip out Transportation costs and that March number plummets to 0%, with non-defense, ex-aircraft actually going negative to -0.1%. Core Capital Equipment Orders sank from a healthy 1.4% in February to 0.9% in March, with the shipments vs. orders ratio at -0.7%. So it would appear new airplane orders had completely covered this economic metric last month.The U.S. Trade Balance surprised to the upside in March to -$68 billion, lower than the -$73.4 billion analysts had been expecting and a revised -$75.9 billion in February. This is relative good news — certainly better than we’d seen earlier in the year — although it’s tough to get excited about a deficit of $68 billion.After the closing bell today, we expect quarterly earnings results from Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), Intel (INTC  -  Free Report) and Expedia (EXPE  -  Free Report), among others. But ahead of today’s open, there is such a huge amount of earnings reports hitting the tape that we’re going to keep it to just a few of the Zacks Rank Buy and Sell stocks this morning:Zacks Rank #2 (Buy)-rated CME Group (CME  -  Free Report) topped earnings estimates by a penny to $1.86 per share, on quarterly revenues that narrowly missed our $1.12 billion Zacks consensus. Revenues were still up 19% year over year, and the company booked an all-time record 22.2 million orders in the quarter.

Baxter’s Q1 strength was in its core Renal Care segment, up 4% year over year. The company also raised full-year guidance.

87,HSY,"The Hershey Company (HSY  -  Free Report) is slated to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 26, before the opening bell.Hershey’s latest cost-savings program, Margin for Growth, is expected to boost profits, which will be reflected in the to-be-reported quarter. As part of this multi-year program, the company will reduce global workforce outside the United States by 15%. The program is intended to improve overall operating margin through supply chain optimization, a streamlined operating model and reduced administrative expenses. Savings from the Margin for Growth program are estimated in the range of $55-$65 million in 2018.Also, under its continuous improvement and productivity (CIP) program, management has optimized its North American manufacturing footprint, added manufacturing capabilities in international markets, increased supply chain productivity and improved the sales mix significantly. The productivity and cost savings from these efforts are being invested in brand building as well as to support growth and gain marketplace insights, which in turn are boosting the company’s margins.Let us delve into other factors that are likely to impact the company’s first-quarter 2018 earnings.Product Innovation to Support Top-Line GrowthThe company’s revenues are expected to rise 3.3% in the to-be-reported quarter, per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, as against a decline of 1.6% in the prior quarter. The consensus estimate for North America segment revenues, comprising 89% of total revenues, is pegged at $1.7 billion, reflecting an increase of 3.5% year over year. International and Other segment is likely to witness 4.4% increase in sales, per the consensus estimate.Products like Cookie Layer Crunch, Popped Snack Mix and Chocolate Dipped Pretzels have significantly contributed to the company’s growth in 2017. The trend is likely to continue in the to-be-reported quarter. The launch of Hershey's Gold in an instant consumable pack type is expected to contribute to revenue growth in the first quarter.Meanwhile, the implementation of Margin for Growth program in China is driving majority of the improvement. However, China SKU analysis and optimization efforts have dented gross sales volume in 2017 and will persist in 2018.Packaging, Freight & Logistics Costs to Hurt MarginsThe introduction of innovative products is not enough to offset sluggish sales performance. Packaging and marketing initiatives are also required to ensure strong customer outreach. The company is transitioning from lay-down bags to stand-up pouches on core chocolate candy products. These ensure that products get on the shelf quicker with less in-store labor and improve shopping experience. These packaging initiatives along with higher freight and logistics cost hurt margins adversely and affect gross margin.Nevertheless, Hershey’s productivity and cost-saving initiatives is likely to offset higher costs. Overall, Hershey’s bottom line is likely to increase 7.6% to $1.06 in the first quarter of 2018.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:Hershey has the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — which is required for an earnings beat.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Hershey is +0.65%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Hershey carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP.Meanwhile, last quarter, the company’s earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.8%.

88,HSY,"The Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report) is slated to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 24, before the opening bell. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 2.63%.In fact, this beverage giant delivered a positive earnings surprise in three of the trailing four quarters, with the average beat being 1.48%.A Look at Coca-Cola’s Revenue PerformanceCoca-Cola has been struggling to boost sales amid weak demand in certain emerging and developing markets, and shifting consumer preferences. The company has been witnessing a decline in revenues for the last 11 quarters, primarily due to weak volumes especially in the sparkling beverage category, and structural changes.Last quarter, Coca-Cola’s revenues declined 20% year over year due to the negative impact of structural items. Acquisitions/divestitures and structural items had a 26% impact on revenues. This time again, the company expects the same degree of adverse impact on net revenues from acquisitions, divestitures and other structural items. Moreover, the first quarter will have one less day than the same period last year. However, the company expects currency to have a positive impact on quarterly net revenues by 2%. Again, revenues will be positively impacted by 1% from Accounting Standards Update 2014-09.That said, the company’s organic revenues grew across the board in the last reported quarter. Coca-Cola has been firing on all cylinders to rejuvenate its portfolio. It has ramped up its efforts to transform into a total beverage company with a broad, consumer-centric brand portfolio and an asset-light business model. Coca-Cola is pursuing investments in newer revenue platforms to boost long-term sales and profits.Coca-Cola witnessed solid growth in the preceding quarter in its developed markets, mainly in Europe and North America, buoyed by improving execution in recently refranchised territories, higher pricing, improved product innovations and packaging strategies. Although other emerging markets were more challenging in the first half of 2017, the company saw an improvement in the key markets like India, Argentina and Brazil as it moved into the second half.Overall, for the first quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Coca-Cola’s total revenues stands at $7.43 billion, implying 18.6% year-over-year decline.Segment DiscussionNorth America, comprising about 30% of the total revenues, is expected to witness solid growth in the first quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment’s revenues of $2.49 billion reflects growth of 96.5% from the preceding quarter and 4.1% sequentially.Latin America revenues are likely to witness 9.3% decline sequentially but 9.4% growth year over year. On the other hand, the consensus estimate for Europe, Middle East and Africa segment revenues of $1.73 billion indicates a decrease from $1.75 billion in the last quarter but an increase from $1.63 billion a year ago. Bottling Investments revenues are likely to decrease to $1.1 billion from $3.9 billion a year ago and $1.1 billion last quarter. Again, Asia Pacific revenues are expected to increase 0.1% on a year-over-year basis and 17.3% sequentially.Cost Savings to Drive GrowthThe cola giant has been focusing on increasing efficiency and improving its margins amid tough business conditions. To that end, Coca-Cola’s strategy to refranchise its bottling operations facilitated improved margins by reducing its exposure to the capital-intensive bottling business. Refranchising efforts, though likely to hurt sales/profits in the near term, will result in higher operating margins, lower capital spending and improved return on invested capital over the long term.Coca-Cola’s adjusted EPS got a 5.4% and 2% boost in Q4 and Q3, respectively, from the year-ago level (after falling for nine consecutive quarters) despite weak revenues. The company’s earnings have topped the consensus mark in 13 of the past 14 quarters.The improvement was attributable to its ongoing productivity initiatives. Its adjusted gross margin expanded 480 basis points or bps in Q4. Comparable operating margin also grew 540 bps. The company’s plan to refranchise its low-margin bottling operations and transform into a capital-light business is helping to improve its margins. The trend is likely to continue in the to-be-reported quarter as well.Again, the company is on track to deliver annualized savings of about $3.8 billion by 2019 through its productivity programs. These include restructuring of its global supply chain, zero-based budgeting and streamlining its operating model.Overall, the beverage behemoth’s first-quarter revenues are likely to decline owing to structural changes. Nonetheless, pricing gains, cost cuts and productivity savings should continue to support the bottom line to some extent.For the first quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 46 cents, reflecting a 7% year-over-year increase.Here is What Our Quantitative Model Predicts:Coca-Cola does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — which are required to be confident of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Coca-Cola is -0.34%.Zacks Rank: Coca-Cola carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP.

89,HSY,"The Procter & Gamble Company (PG  -  Free Report), popularly known as P&G, reported third-quarter fiscal 2018 financial results, wherein both earnings and revenues surpassed expectations, benefiting from higher demand for skincare products, along with fabric and home care products. The company has also lifted its core earnings per share guidance.P&G’s fiscal third-quarter core earnings of $1.00 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 98 cents by 2%. The bottom line increased 4% from the prior-year quarter. Currency-neutral core earnings per share (EPS) also improved 1%. The upside was primarily driven by increased net sales and a lower core effective tax rate.Meanwhile, P&G agreed to acquire the consumer-health business of Germany-based Merck KGaA for approximately 3.4 billion euro ($4 billion). Per the terms, P&G will also acquire 51.8% stake in India-listed Merck Ltd. The deal is expected to close during the 2018/19 fiscal. The addition of Merck KGaA’s differentiated as well as physician-supported brands will enhance P&G's existing consumer healthcare capabilities, and brands such as Vicks, Pepto-Bismol and Oral-B. The buyout is expected to boost the company’s brand portfolio and category footprint. It will also expand P&G’s geographic footprint, as Merck KGaA’s consumer health business is active in 44 countries and includes more than 900 products.Sales in DetailsP&G’s reported net sales of $16.3 billion surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $16.2 billion. The top line grew 4% from the year-ago level, given strong sales from its beauty, and fabric and homecare businesses. Foreign exchange had a 4% positive impact on sales.    Organically (excluding the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange), revenues grew 1% (versus 2% growth seen in the preceding quarter) on the back of 2% increase in organic volumes. However, price had a 2% negative impact on sales.Of the five business segments, three registered positive organic sales growth. Beauty, Health Care, and Fabric & Home Care segments registered organic sales growth of 5%, 1% and 3%, respectively, in the quarter. Grooming and Baby, Feminine & Family Care segments, on the other hand, registered 3% organic sales decline each.Net sales of the Beauty, Fabric & Home Care, Health Care and Grooming segments grew 10%, 6%, 5% and 2%, respectively. However, Baby, Feminine & Family Care segment’s sales remained flat in the quarter.Procter & Gamble Company (The) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Procter & Gamble Company (The) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Procter & Gamble Company (The) QuoteMarginsCore gross margin decreased 110 basis points (bps) to 49.4%, as productivity savings and higher sales were more than offset by headwinds such as increased commodity costs, unfavorable geographic and product mix, unfavorable pricing impacts and product reinvestments.Core selling, general and administrative expense (SG&A) margin decreased 10 bps (as a percentage of sales) to 28.3%, driven by productivity savings from overhead, higher revenues, agency fee and ad production costs. Core operating margin decreased 100 bps year over year to 21.1%.Productivity cost savings contributed 310 bps of margin benefit in the quarter. P&G has been cutting costs aggressively to reduce spending across all areas like supply chain, research & development, marketing and overheads.FinancialsAs of Mar 31, 2018, the company’s cash and cash equivalents were $5.3 billion, down from $5.6 billion at the end of fiscal 2017 (as of Jun 30, 2017). Long-term debt was $22.4 billion as of Mar 31, 2018, up from $18 billion at the end of fiscal 2017.Cash flow from operating activities was $10.7 billion in the first nine months of fiscal 2018, up from $9.1 billion a year ago.The company returned $3.2 billion of cash to shareholders through $1.8 billion of dividend payments and $1.4 billion of common stock repurchase.Earlier this month, P&G’s board of directors declared a 4% hike in its quarterly cash dividend to 71.72 cents per share, in a bid to impress investors. This consumer goods giant has consistently increased its dividend and has been paying dividends for 128 years, ever since its incorporation in 1890. In fact, the latest increase marks P&G’s 62nd consecutive year of dividend hike.Fiscal 2018 GuidanceThe Cincinnati, OH-based company maintained its projection for the year and expects organic sales growth in the range of 2-3% for fiscal 2018. However, P&G expects organic sales to be at the low end of the range. All-in sales growth is expected to be about 3%.The company has lifted its core EPS growth projection to 6-8% (versus 5-8% expected earlier) compared with fiscal 2017 core earnings of $3.92 per share.On a GAAP basis, EPS is expected to decrease 31-33% (unlike the 30-32% decrease expected earlier) versus the fiscal 2017 GAAP EPS of $5.59, which included a significant benefit from the Beauty Brands transaction that was completed in October 2016. The fiscal 2018 GAAP EPS estimate includes approximately 14 cents per share of non-core restructuring costs and 25 cents per share of non-core charges related to the Tax Act.P&G carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

90,HSY,"The Procter & Gamble Company (PG  -  Free Report) is set to report third-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Apr 20, before market opens. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 3.48%.In fact, this consumer goods company delivered a positive earnings surprise in each of the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 4.11%.Factors to ConsiderWeak volumes and slowing market share growth have been hurting sales of Procter & Gamble for quite some time. However, the company has been witnessing improved sales environment and thereby earnings in the recent times, thanks to higher volumes driven by innovation, proficient distribution, and in-store activity.In the last reported quarter, sales grew 3%, increasing in 14 of the 15 largest markets and 8 out of 10 categories. Overall organic sales were up 2% comprising 2% volume growth. Market share trends are improving modestly, with Procter & Gamble holding or growing shares in 27/50 top category-country combinations (versus 22 last year). In fact, the company’s sales grew 2% in the first six months driven by 2% volume growth.We expect this improving sales trend to follow in the to-be-reported quarter as well, driven by growth in key markets, product categories, as well as e-commerce and in-store operations. Notably, the company’s premium offerings like Olay have been registering solid growth in China. In the fiscal second quarter, Olay in China achieved its third consecutive quarter of double-digit growth.That said, various top-line headwinds continue to persist. Overall, the soft category growth rate in developed countries and higher competition in the United States from brands like Dollar Shave Club and Harry’s Razor in the male grooming category are likely to hurt the company’s razors and blades’ sales. Again, challenges in the baby care category, lower pricing owing to increased competition in the shave care category and higher commodity costs are added woes. Meanwhile, the Algerian government’s import ban on finished products and lower subsidies in Saudi Arabia are added concerns.Despite the above-mentioned headwinds, Procter & Gamble reiterated its fiscal 2018 sales projection. The company expects organic sales growth in the range of 2-3% for fiscal 2018. All-in sales growth is expected about 3%.Overall, for the fiscal third quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues is pegged at $16.2 billion, reflecting year-over-year growth of 3.5%.Apart from the sales improvement, let’s take a look at the company’s margin story. Despite muted sales growth, the company has exceeded analysts’ expectations on earnings for the 11th consecutive quarter. Procter & Gamble has managed to post higher earnings despite tepid sales owing to productivity and cost-saving plans in order to boost margins, thereby lifting profit level.However, the company failed to expand margins in the last three reported quarters, as productivity savings were more than offset by headwinds such as increased commodity costs, unfavorable geographic and product mix, and product reinvestments. Then again, the company’s focus on reducing its SG&A (selling, general, and administrative) costs, and lowering its marketing and advertising spending has helped it in supporting its operating margins to some extent. The trend is unlikely to change in the to-be-reported quarter as well.Overall, for the quarter to be reported, the company’s margins are likely to remain subdued due to higher input costs. The company expects higher commodity costs including pulp, kerosene, ethylene and propylene to adversely impact its profitability by $300 million in fiscal 2018.Again, unfavorable mix and lower pricing in the shave care category are likely to impact margins further. Procter & Gamble’s investing in price to drive sales of its razors and blades, due to increased competition from shave clubs, have affected its market share. Yet, productivity savings and share repurchases will partly offset these woes.For the fiscal third quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 98 cents, reflecting growth of 2.1% year over year.Here is What Our Quantitative Model Predicts:Procter & Gamble does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — to increase the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP:  Procter & Gamble has an Earnings ESP of -0.58%.Zacks Rank: The company carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP.

91,HSY,"B&G Foods, Inc. (BGS  -  Free Report) reported lower-than-expected results for the fourth quarter of 2017.Adjusted earnings of 57 cents missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 59 cents by 3.4%.

The upside was favored by an increase in unit volume, partially offset by a decrease in net pricing.The increase in unit volume was primarily driven by an additional six weeks of net sales at the spices & seasonings business. It was also favored by additional four weeks and three months of net sales at Victoria and Back to Nature businesses, respectively.Net sales at the company’s Base business totaled $380.9 million, a mere 0.3% decline from the year-ago quarter.Net sales of Green Giant frozen products rose 23.4% year over year favored by innovative product launches, whereas, that of Pirate Brands increased 11.4% due to efficient promotional events and distribution gains. The net sales growth in these brands was somewhat offset by weak consumption trends in shelf-stable and maple syrup products. Heightened competition also partially marred revenue growth.B&G Foods, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise B&G Foods, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | B&G Foods, Inc. QuoteOperating HighlightsGross profit margin in the fourth quarter was 21.4%, a decline of 440 basis points (bps) year over year. The downside was primarily due to increased expenses in warehousing and distribution. A decrease in net pricing also partially affected gross profit margin.Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 0.4% to $59 million from the prior-year quarter, primarily due to acquisition-related expenses.The company reported net income of $129.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, up from $13.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The upside was driven by a tax benefit.Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) increased 10.5% to $68.9 million during the quarter.Balance SheetB&G Foods ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $206.5 million, as of Dec 30, 2017, compared with $28.8 million as of Dec 31, 2016.

92,HSY,"General Mills Inc. (GIS  -  Free Report) is foraying outside of food for human consumption, as it intends to buy Blue Buffalo Pet Products Inc. . Notably, this buyout is the latest by the food giant, seeking to expand in the $30 billion U.S. pet food market and reshape its portfolio as it struggles with weak demand amid changing consumer preferences.The DealGeneral Mills will pay Blue Buffalo shareholders $40 per share or $8 billion in cash to acquire the company, which will operate as a new pet operating segment. This represents a premium of 17.2% to Blue Buffalo’s closing price as of Feb 22. General Mills’ other four segments are North American retail, convenience stores and foodservice, Europe & Australia and Asia & Latin America.Will General Mills Be Able to Boost Sales With Blue Buffalo Buyout?The U.S. pet food market is a $30 billion industry, growing in the 3-4% range each year. Founded in 2002, Blue Buffalo is the leader in the fastest-growing Wholesome Natural category with double-digit growth in each of the last three years. The Wholesome Natural market represents approximately 10% of the pet food market in volume and 20% in value. Blue Buffalo generates more than $1 billion in yearly sales, profiting from robust demand for its BLUE brand of dog and cat food made with whole meats, fruits and vegetables. Blue Buffalo’s revenues have advanced at an annual compound rate of 12% over the past three years. This reflects significant demand from consumers of upmarket pet food brands.General Mills expects the addition of Blue Buffalo to help the company boost its top as well as bottom line. The company expects Blue Buffalo to be immediately accretive to the company’s top-line and operating margin profile, with bottom-line growth expected in fiscal 2020.

As a result of this, food companies, namely General Mills and Kellogg Company (K  -  Free Report), have been witnessing weak sales over the past few quarters.Big food giants are gradually re-shuffling their shelves and are making niche acquisitions, given tepid demand. For example, in a bid to go beyond chocolate and gain a solid footing in the fast-growing market for healthy snacks, Hershey Co. (HSY  -  Free Report) inked a deal last December to acquire Amplify Snack Brands Inc. — the maker of SkinnyPop and Tyrrell’s potato chips.Kellogg acquired protein-bar maker, Chicago Bar Company in 2017. Chicago Bar Company makes RXBAR, which is considered to be the fastest growing nutrition bar brand in the United States. The addition of “clean-label, high-protein” RXBAR can be expected to revive Kellogg’s wholesome snacks business, which has been weak over the past few quarters.Meanwhile, Conagra Brands Inc (CAG  -  Free Report) took over Boomchickapop popcorn maker, Angie's Artisan Treats, in September 2017.General Mills, a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company, has been focusing on various strategies for fiscal 2018 to combat weak sales trajectory. The latest addition is expected to place General Mills as the leader in the U.S. Wholesome Natural pet food category, which is the fastest growing section of the overall pet food market, and accelerates its portfolio reshaping strategy.""In pet food, as in human food, consumers are seeking more natural and premium products,"" said General Mills CEO Jeff Harmening.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

94,HSY,"Over time by, Valentine’s Day has become not just a special day for lovers, but a day for business too. Exchanging chocolates, precious metals and gifts to shower affection in turn brings a lot of business opportunities. This year, cupid struck Americans quite successfully if we go by data provided by the National Retail Federation (NRF). American spending on this Valentine’s Day is expected to rise 7.7% to $19.6 billion, marking the second-highest level in the survey’s 15-year history but a tad short of $19.7 billion recorded in 2016. U.S. consumers are likely to spend an average $143.56, higher than last year’s record-high of $136.57.So, it’s natural that people will start searching for innovative gift ideas for the event. In this regard, below we describe ETFs and stocks that should be admired this Valentine’s Day.Go for Candies Now and Cocoa ETFs With a Strong StomachA big share of Valentine’s Day spending is on candies, teddies, flowers, wine and champagne. As per the National Retail Federation, around 55% of people plan to spend on candies or chocolates, up from 50% last year. Candy makers will draw around $1.8 billion this year.However, this year, cocoa – the key ingredient of chocolate – is a boring bet from an investing point of view. However, as per Reuters, cocoa prices should gain strength by the end of the year, improving after two successive annual declines. Constricting supplies are the reason behind this bet. So, you can buy your valentine cocoa ETF iPath Pure Beta Cocoa ETN  with a long-term focus.In the United States – the biggest chocolate market globally – retail sales growth of chocolate candy improved at moderate pace (up 3.2% in 2017 on an annualized level). So, one can go for the final product candy and bet on confectionary products maker The Hershey Company (HSY  -  Free Report).Leisure and Entertainment Stocks and ETFs Good BetAs many as 35.2% of the population spends on an evening out. And dining out means splurging on food and drinks and going to some exotic restaurants. The whiskey and spirits sector, a niche within the consumer discretionary space, could thus gain ahead, leaving Spirited Funds/ETFMG Whiskey&Spirits ETF  and Ambev S.A. (ABEV  -  Free Report) as good picks. The stock belongs to a top-ranked Zacks industry (top 29%).Some hotels including Marriott International (MAR  -  Free Report) and Hyatt Hotels Corporation H also come under the spotlight. The stocks represent a top-ranked Zacks industry (top 40%). If you consider restaurants, one can target the likes of Darden Restaurants Inc. DRI, Del Frisco's Restaurant Group Inc. DFRG and Ruth's Hospitality Group Inc. RUTH. These stocks are all placed within the top-ranked Zacks industry (top 29%).Precious Metals to DazzleAs much as $4.7 billion is likely to be spent on jewelry (around 19% of total expenditure and up 9.3% year over year). With diamonds or platinum ornaments or cufflinks to take the spotlight as V-Day gifts, gold bullion ETF SPDR Gold Shares (GLD  -  Free Report) could shine especially after the latest market selloffs. Traders may turn to ETFS Physical Platinum (PPLT  -  Free Report) and iShares Silver Trust (SLV  -  Free Report) (read: Must-Follow ETF Moves as Finally Selloffs Set In).If precious metals stay subdued on economic reasons, then investors can easily try Tiffany & Co. TIF.

With these, VanEck Vectors Retail ETF (RTH  -  Free Report) and SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT  -  Free Report) emerge as good V-Day ETF gifts.And who can forget online retail ETF – the most important medium of shopping? In-store purchases have been hitting the brakes lately with surging demand for technologies. This makes Amplify Online Retail ETF (IBUY  -  Free Report) an intriguing ETF deal for Valentine’s Day (read: Holiday Sales At 6-Year High: Best Consumer ETFs & Stocks).Florists & Gift Shops Will See a Rosy Valentine Day As much as 36% of spending (worth $2 billion) will be on flowers, giving companies like 1-800 Flowers.Com Inc.

95,HSY,"Welcome to a Winter Olympics edition of the Full-Court Finance podcast from Zacks Investment Research. On this week’s episode, we explore the companies driving the 2018 Games in Pyeongchang, South Korea.The next two weeks are massively important for NBC Universal and its parent company Comcast (CMCSA  -  Free Report), as the media conglomerate has spent billions of dollars to broadcast the Olympics for years to come.NBC outbid Fox (FOXA  -  Free Report) and Disney’s (DIS  -  Free Report) ABC and ESPN to earn its domestic broadcast rights. The company has since sought to innovate its coverage through a recent streaming push and future-looking partnerships with firms such as Snap Inc. (SNAP).One of the main reasons NBC can justify spending this money is because advertisers are willing to shell out the cash to promote their brands during the global athletic showcase. This year, Google (GOOGL  -  Free Report), Famers Insurance, Hershey (HSY  -  Free Report), and many others are official NBC partners.But there are also 13 top dogs: the firms that spend over $100 million to become official International Olympic Committee sponsors. This list includes Visa V, Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report), Procter & Gamble (PG  -  Free Report), and General Electric (GE  -  Free Report), along with recently added tech giants Alibaba (BABA  -  Free Report) and Intel INTC—which will give fans a taste of its virtual reality capabilities from Pyeongchang.The Olympics are also a time for companies and apparel brands to attach themselves to athletes. Ralph Lauren (RL  -  Free Report) outfitted Team USA with gear for the opening ceremonies, while medal winners will sport Nike (NKE  -  Free Report) on the podiums. Even Under Armour (UAA  -  Free Report) got back in the action after some athletes panned its gear in 2014.And this year’s games were awarded to South Korea, due in large part to a push from the former head of one of the world’s most well-known technology companies.

The bottom line increased 5.5% year over year banking on higher operating profit and lower restructuring charges.Revenues BeatKellogg reported revenues of $3.21 billion, increasing 3.6% year over year.

Adjusted operating profit improved 9.9% in the Asia Pacific.2018 ViewsKellogg’s expects revenues to remain flat on a currency-neutral basis for 2018.

Cash from operating activities is expected to increase in the band of $1.7-1.8 billion for 2018 driven by higher net income, sustained working-capital improvement and benefits from U.S. Tax Reform.Zacks RankKellogg carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

98,HSY,"The Hershey Co. (HSY  -  Free Report) is likely to acquire Nestle's U.S. confectionery business, which includes brands such as Butterfinger, Baby Ruth, Sno-Caps and Laffy Taffy, per media reports. The chocolate giant may have submitted its final bids on Jan 5, 2018.However, Ferrero, best known for its Nutella chocolate spread and Ferrero Rocher bonbons, is also believed to be among the potential bidders. Ferrero, Hershey and Nestle all declined to comment on the news.In June 2017, Nestle revealed that it was exploring strategic options that include a possible sale of its U.S. chocolate and candy business. In July, Nestle said that the business attracted considerable interest from bidders.Nestle's U.S. confectionery business unit is expected to be worth as much as $2.5 million.Hershey, in a bid to go beyond chocolate and gain a solid footing in the fast-growing market for healthy snacks, inked a deal last month to acquire Amplify Snack Brands Inc. (BETR), the maker of SkinnyPop and Tyrrell’s potato chips for $1.6 billion. In the last two years, Hershey acquired brands like Krave meat jerky and Ripple Brand Collective's barkTHINS as well.Hershey’s president and CEO, Michele Buck, had earlier expressed that the company is optimistic about its chocolate portfolio and is expected to leverage its snack business through potential mergers and acquisitions.Notably, the company’s top-line performance was weak since 2014.  Sales increased a meager 0.7% in 2016 and 1.9% in the first nine months of 2017. Much of the sales debacle could be attributable to consumers’ changing eating patterns and their evolving preferences for healthy, fresh and organic food products. Hence, Hershey is looking for ways to boost its top line.Currently, Hershey and other food companies, like General Mills Inc. (GIS  -  Free Report), Kellogg Co. (K  -  Free Report), Conagra Brands Inc. (CAG  -  Free Report) and others, are regularly adding new products and innovating its core brands to meet consumer demand and needs that are not addressed by its current portfolio.

99,HSY,"Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and The Hershey Company (HSY  -  Free Report) may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Hershey is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings—with the most up-to-date information possible—is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for HSY in this report.Analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for HSY, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +0.87% heading into earnings season.Hershey Company (The) Price and EPS Surprise Hershey Company (The) Price and EPS Surprise | Hershey Company (The) QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10 year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here).Given that HSY has a Zacks Rank #3 and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings.

101,HSY,"In a bid to go beyond chocolate and gain a solid footing in the fast-growing market for healthy snacks Hershey Co. (HSY  -  Free Report) inked a deal to acquire Amplify Snack Brands Inc.  — the maker of SkinnyPop and Tyrrell’s potato chips.Consequently, Amplify's shares were up 71.6% on Dec 18 while Hershey gained a mere 0.1%.Terms of the DealHershey agreed to buy all outstanding shares of Amplify Snack Brands for $12 a share, which is a 71% premium to Friday’s closing price. Valued at approximately $1.6 billion, the deal includes net debt and a make-whole payment of $76 million related to the Tax Receivable Agreement (TRA).Per the company, the transaction is slated to close in the first quarter of 2018 and will be funded with cash on hand and new debt.  In fact, the acquisition is expected to be accretive to Hershey's earnings in the first year following the deal closure..The accord is also anticipated to generate approximately $20 million in annual run-rate synergies over the next two years.However, the takeover is not expected to affect Hershey’s full-year 2017 guidance, projected earlier.Hershey and Other Food Biggies Diversify to Combat Fading DemandThe packaged food industry is suffering from waning consumer demand due to the shift in consumer preferences to healthier options. In this context, Austin, TX-based Amplify seems to be gaining ground as it offers the better-for-you food products. Apart from owing Skinny Pop popcorn and Tyrrells potato chips, Amplify also owns Oatmega bars made with whey protein from grass-fed cows in New Zealand.Over the past two years, Hershey acquired brands like Krave meat jerky and Ripple Brand Collective's barkTHINS as well. Notably, the company’s top-line performance was weak since 2014.  However, sales increased a meager 0.7% in 2016 and 1.9% in the first nine months of 2017. Persistent macroeconomic challenges in China continued to hurt the company’s result. Notably, soft international sales due to macro headwinds, changing consumer shopping habits and intense competition from the broader snacking environment in the United States were mainly responsible for the sales results.Apart from Hershey, other big food giants are gradually re-shuffling their shelves and are making niche acquisitions, given tepid demand.In a separate press release, Campbell Soup Company (CPB  -  Free Report) unveiled deal to buy Cape Cod chips-maker Snyder's-Lance, Inc.  for $4.87 billion in cash to fight declining soup sales. The No. 5 U.S. healthy savory snacks maker — Snyder's-Lance — also owns brands like Eatsmart veggie snacks.Although Campbell and Hershey operate in different section of food industry, their core products have been suffering from lower demand. Much of the sales debacle could be attributable to consumers’ changing eating patterns and their evolving preferences for healthy, fresh and organic food products.Other biggies like General Mills Inc. (GIS  -  Free Report) and Kellogg Co (K  -  Free Report) are also acquiring or investing in healthier options to boost sales and thereby profits. In line with the strategy to diversify its organic offerings, Kellogg entered into an agreement in October 2017 to acquire protein bar maker — Chicago Bar Company. Chicago Bar Company makes RXBAR, which is considered to be the fastest growing nutrition bar brand in the United States. The addition of “clean-label, high-protein” RXBAR can be expected to revive Kellogg’s wholesome snacks business, which has been weak over the past few quarters.Meanwhile, Conagra Brands Inc (CAG  -  Free Report) took over Boomchickapop popcorn maker — Angie's Artisan Treats — in September 2017.Currently, Hershey and these food companies are regularly bringing innovations to its core brands to meet consumer demand and needs that are not addressed by its current portfolio. Hershey expects innovation to help it achieve its long-term net sales growth target of 2% to 4%.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have gained 10.5% year to date, as against the industry’s loss of 20.6%. Although the Hershey’s earnings estimates for the current quarter and current year remained unchanged, successful innovation and progress in multi-year productivity, and cost-saving initiatives are likely to drive growth for this largest producer of quality chocolate products.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. Zacks Editor-in-Chief Goes """"All In"""" on This StockFull disclosure, Kevin Matras now has more of his own money in one particular stock than in any other.

102,HSY,"The U.S. stock market seems to have defied the eerie All Hallows’ Eve by maintaining its bull run, and the ‘Halloween Strategy’, a technique in which investors start placing big bets on All Hallows' Eve after restraining in the preceding six months, gives us even more optimism right now.Demand for candies and costumes in the Halloween season drives sales at U.S. retailers, including discount stores. Sales of such items are poised to beat the previous year numbers, courtesy of upbeat consumer sentiment. The finances of consumers have, largely, benefitted from an improving economy with lower unemployment and better wages.Spooky Stock Market Ghosts, Goblins and GhoulsThe fears and apprehensions concerning the broader market are unsubstantiated.For instance, has the war of words between North Korea’s Kim Jong-Un and Trump scared investors? Apparently not, as the market continues to gain unhindered.Another fear is that the Fed will hike rates, killing a bull market fueled by cheap borrowing. But, policymakers haven’t hiked rates yet. They fear that a rate hike will strengthen the dollar, eventually denting U.S. exports and hampering economic growth.Finally, should a lofty valuation give you goosebumps? Nope and nope. Bull markets often scale to a string of record highs. So, if you succumb to the fear of highs, you eventually lose money.Halloween Drives Record Sales of CandyWith more money expected to pour in, candy sales are expected to rise. In fact, Halloween accounts for about 10% of the industry’s total annual sales, which in turn leads to fierce competition among confectioners.According to IHS Markit data, candy sales are set to rise 4.1% from last year, reaching a seasonally adjusted $4.1 billion. This is particularly impressive given that candy prices have declined 0.9% from last year, marking the second successive drop in Halloween candy prices.Halloween is like Super Bowl Sunday for North America’s largest chocolate maker — Hershey Co (HSY  -  Free Report). Banking on this upbeat sales forecast, the maker of Kisses, Reese’s, Krackel, Symphony and Mr. Goodbar expects sales to go up 8% from last year. The company has seen its earnings grow over the last five years, driving its share price from $70 to nearly $105.Another major player, Mondelez International Inc (MDLZ  -  Free Report), is expected to gain immensely from this year’s rise in candy sales. It is a successor to Kraft Foods Inc, which owns household names in the candy industry like Nabisco, Cadbury and Toblerone. It has seen its share price climb from around $27 the year it was introduced to almost $40 today.Halloween to Boost Costume and Discount Store SalesA large chunk of Halloween spending will go to costumes as well. According to a survey by the National Retail Federation (NRF), Americans are expected to spend $3.4 billion on costumes. The survey also shows that majority of consumers will shop online for costumes, while about 30% will do so at retail stores.In fact, as per the NRF, spending on All Hallows' Eve this year will be more than $9 billion. This marks a rise from around $8.5 billion last year.Consumer Confidence Rides HighThe upbeat reading on Halloween sales says a lot about consumer sentiments, which have been improving on a strengthening economy. The U.S. economy expanded at a solid seasonally adjusted 3% annual rate in the third quarter of 2017, according to the Commerce Department. Such an expansion came on the heels of 3.1% growth in the second quarter. It also marks the first time of two consecutive quarters of 3% growth or more since mid-2014.The economy was boosted by solid consumer spending, and a steady job market buoyed household optimism. The unemployment rate declined to 4.2% in September, the lowest since February 2001, while wages increased 0.5% to an average of $26.55 an hour, per the Labor Department. In fact, in the last 12 months, hourly pay increased 2.9%, up from 2.7% in the prior month and also in line with a post-recession high (read more: US GDP Hits 3% Despite Twin Hurricanes: 5 Top Gainers).4 Solid PicksHere we look at four publicly traded companies from the aforesaid areas that are positioned to gain the maximum this Halloween. These companies flaunt a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy).PepsiCo, Inc. (PEP  -  Free Report) is a global food and beverage company. It is known for manufacturing different types of candies and is among the top 50 candy producers in the world. The stock has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Big Lots has moved north over the past 90 days, with estimates rising from $4.18 per share to $4.22 per share.

103,HSY,"Kellogg Company (K  -  Free Report) posted better-than-expected third-quarter 2017 results. Cost-saving initiatives as well as higher demand for its frozen foods and Kashi snacks helped the company offset the industry-wide soft consumption trends for packaged food items.Earnings BeatThird-quarter comparable earnings of $1.05 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 93 cents by 12.9%. Earnings increased 9.4% year over year banking on higher operating profit that offset a higher tax rate.Adjusted earnings exclude costs associated with a mark-to-market loss and certain other items. Including these items, however, the company reported earnings of 85 cents per share, higher than the year-ago earnings of 82 cents.Revenues BeatKellogg reported revenues of $3.27 billion, increasing 0.6% year over year after several quarters of revenue decline. The upside can be primarily attributed to the December 2016 acquisition of Parati in Brazil, as well as favorable currency translation. Revenues surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.21 billion by 1.8%.Currency had a 0.6% positive impact on sales in the quarter. Acquisitions also had a 1.6% positive impact on revenues. However, Venezuela deconsolidation had a 0.2% negative impact on the top line. Accordingly, organic revenues (excluding the impact of acquisitions, dispositions and foreign exchange) fell 1.4% compared with a 3.1% decline in the previous quarter. Except Asia Pacific, organic sales decreased across all other regions.Volumes decreased 1.6%, a shade better than the 4.9% decrease in the preceding quarter. On the other hand, price/mix added 0.2% to sales, lower than the 1.8% contribution in the last quarter.Profits RiseKellogg’s operating margin (currency-neutral comparable growth) was 17.6%, reflecting an improvement of 280 basis points (bps) year over year, as the company benefitted from strong productivity savings related to the Project K restructuring program, particularly this year's exit from its U.S. Snacks segment's Direct Store Delivery (DSD) system and its related elimination of overhead during the quarter.Comparable operating profit grew 18.3% year over year in the quarter to $568 million.Segment DiscussionTotal North America: Kellogg’s North America sales declined 1.6% (also organically) year over year to $2.18 billion, due to the impacts related to the transition out of DSD in the U.S. Snacks business, as well as continued consumption softness in U.S. cereal in traditional retail channels. Volumes decreased 1% compared with a decline of 3.7% witnessed in the previous quarter. Price/mix decreased 0.9% compared with 1.8% growth in the prior quarter. Adjusted (comparable) operating profit increased 19.1% in the segment.Europe: Segment revenues of $599 million improved 0.8% and currency had a 1.2% positive impact on revenues. Organically, sales were up 0.1% in the third quarter compared with a decline of 7% in the last quarter. Adjusted operating profit declined 0.9%.Latin America: Segment revenues of $240 million improved 21.5% (organically, revenues were up 1.1%) owing to 6.1% price/mix growth and 3.2% positive impact from currency. Acquisitions also had a 24.4% positive impact of revenues. This was partly offset by a decline of 8.2% in volume. Adjusted operating profit decreased 6.9% in Latin America.Asia Pacific: Segment revenues of $254 million improved 2.9% on the back of strong growth across the region for Pringles and continued broad-based growth in Asia. Organically, sales increased 2.9%, better than 2.1% growth in the last quarter. Volumes increased 2.7%, while price/mix had a negative impact of 0.7% on sales. Adjusted operating profit improved 10.9% in the Asia Pacific.2017 Views ReaffirmedThe company continues to expect revenues to decline about 3% on a currency-neutral comparable basis.The company expects adjusted constant currency earnings to grow in the range of 8-10% in the range of $4.03-$4.09 per share.Adjusted constant-currency operating profit growth projection was maintained in the range of 7-9%. Operating margin is expected to improve more than a full percentage point, and is well on track to achieve its goal of 350 basis points expansion from 2015 through 2018.Zacks RankKellogg carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

105,HSY,"General Mills Inc. (GIS  -  Free Report) is set to report second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Dec 20, before market open. Last quarter, the company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 7.79%.This branded consumer foods’ company delivered a positive earnings surprise in two of the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 1.74%.Factors to ConsiderGeneral Mills has been reporting dismal revenues for the last few quarters. Much like other U.S. food giants, General Mills too is having a tough time due to the shift in consumer preference toward natural and organic food.Although General Mills is making significant efforts to drive revenue growth through consumer-focused innovations and marketing initiatives in its key businesses, the company is expected to witness muted sales growth in the second quarter of fiscal 2018. This is due to continued volume declines in North America.Although the company expects organic sales to improve in the second quarter sequentially, we believe that the company needs time to register growth. The company expects product innovations, promotions during key seasons for soup and refrigerated dough, and investments in compelling media campaigns to strengthen its brands, will bring in improvements.Sales and profits at the North America Retail segment, accounting for about 65% of the company’s total sales, have been soft due to lower demand amid weak food industry trends and changing consumer preferences.Again, lower volumes and higher input costs are creating pressure on margins despite having profound cost-cutting initiatives to boost margin amid soft sales. General Mills’ adjusted gross margin contracted 230 basis points (bps), while its adjusted operating margin plunged 210 bps year over year in its last reported quarter. The downside was mainly due to continued decline in volumes, higher input costs on imported products, increase in advertising media expenses, and unfavorable mix that offset the benefits of its cost-saving plan.For the to-be-reported quarter, the company expects the factors to turn favorable. Primarily, General Mills anticipates its volume to improve, banking on innovation in brand building. Hence, the rate decline of the company’s adjusted operating margin is expected to lessen in the second quarter (Read more: Will General Mills Witness Improved Margins in Q2?).Overall, an expected decline in volumes, primarily in North America, higher promotional expenses, as planned for the second half of fiscal 2018, and rising input costs are likely to remain a drag on its bottom line in the to-be-reported quarter. Then again, General Mills’ focus on reducing its cost of goods sold through its margin-improvement plan along with lower share count is anticipated to give support for its EPS growth to some extent.For the fiscal second quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 82 cents, reflecting a decline of 3.2% year over year. Meanwhile, the consensus estimate for revenues is pegged at $4.06 billion, implying a 1.2% decline.Here is what our quantitative model predicts.General Mills does not have the right combination of ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP  and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — which increase the odds of an earnings beat. Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for General Mills is -1.93%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.   Zacks Rank: General Mills carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

106,HSY,"Palantir Technologies is a privately-held software and services company that has taken Silicon Valley by storm since its launch back in 2004. It was founded by Peter Thiel, Nathan Gettings, Joe Lonsdale, Stephen Cohen, and Alex Karp (now CEO) with the idea of “creating the world’s best user experience for working with data, one that empowers people to ask and answer complex questions without requiring them to master querying languages, statistical modeling, or the command line.”While its name is derived from the palantÍr, a “seeing stone” in J.R.R. Tolkein’s fantasy series Lord of the Rings—even its motto is “Save the Shire,” in reference to the home of the hobbits of Middle Earth—Palantir actually emerged from mobile payments giant PayPal’s (PYPL  -  Free Report) anti-fraud efforts (its co-founder Thiel also co-founded PayPal).It’s also often considered to be one of the most secretive tech unicorns out there today. And by secretive, I mean a couple of things. For one, many people just haven’t heard of the company, especially outside of the tech and investing worlds; its Big Data focus is not nearly as flashy and exciting as ride-hailing or home-sharing. For another, Palantir and its technology is still best known for antiterrorism and spycraft, two avenues that must be secretive in order to thrive. It’s “Minority Report come true,” writes The Guardian.What They DoIf you have heard of Palantir, then you know that the company’s technology has been used in several notable cases, including the discovery of the infamous Chinese espionage networks, GhostNet and the Shadow Network. There’s also their rumored-but-never-confirmed efforts to help take down Osama Bin Laden.Even though its role in Bin Laden’s takedown will likely never be established as fact, what can be recognized, however, is Palantir’s extensive relationship with the U.S. government. Just as recently as six years ago, Palantir sold exclusively to the government sector.  The FBI, CIA, IRS, CDC, Department of Homeland Security, Department of Defense, and several branches of the armed forces have all been customers, and up to 50% of the company’s business is tied to the public sector. Even In-Q-Tel, the CIA’s venture arm, was an early investor.For instance, The Guardian goes on to note that the Pentagon “used Palantir software [in Iraq] to track patterns in roadside bomb deployment and worked out garage-door openers were being used as remote detonators by predicting it.”Palantir also has commercial customers that rely on them to detect fraud, study consumer behavior, and search for a competitive edge against rivals; these clients include JPMorgan Chase (JPM  -  Free Report), Hershey (HSY  -  Free Report), and Bridgewater Associates, a global investment management firm, among others. Overall, private customers make up about 75% of Palantir’s revenue, notes Fortune.Big Data PioneerAs a whole, Palantir prides itself on being one of the world’s Big Data solutions experts. It’s a term that refers to a collection of structured and multi-structured data from traditional and digital sources inside and outside a company, representing a source for ongoing discovery and analysis. Examples of structured data include tweets (TWTR  -  Free Report) and other social media posts, while multi-structured data is something that can be derived from interactions between people and machines.To help tackle Big Data, Palantir created two software suites for which it’s best known for. Formerly known as Palantir Finance, Palantir Metropolis is software for data integration, information management, and quantitative analytics. The software connects to commercial, proprietary, and public data sets and discovery trends, relationships and anomalies, including predictive analytics. And yes, this software suite is named after the home city of Superman.For users like hedge funds, banks, and financial services firms, Metropolis provides a number of integrated applications in order to build up interactive models using all the data that is available in their system. This includes Custom Metric, Dashboard, Date Set, Explorer, Regression, and Spreadsheet applications.The other is Palantir Gotham, formerly known as Palantir Government. This software integrates structured and unstructured data, provides search and discovery capabilities, knowledge management, and secure collaboration. Like Metropolis, Gotham is named after the home city of fellow superhero Batman.Gotham provides a suite of tools that are optimized for semantic, temporal, geospatial, and full-text analysis. Users can seamlessly drag and drop data objects from one application to the next, and applications include Graphs, Maps, Object Explorer, Browser, and Mobile.IPO BuzzWith a valuation at $20 billion, Palantir is one of the world’s most valuable venture-backed tech startups, but the company has yet to lay out any specific plans for an initial public offering. However, that hasn’t stopped IPO buzz from building, and investors have been excited for a while now about the potential for a Palantir market debut.The hype grew even more once President Trump took office, as co-founder Thiel is one of his closest tech advisors and CEO Karp joined with some of the industry’s biggest names—including executives from Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report), and Facebook (FB  -  Free Report), just to name a few—during the president’s transition period.Despite its impressive valuation and presidential connections, Palantir is still not profitable, though the company expects to reach profitability in 2017. Palantir doesn’t report current revenue, but according to Fortune, it brought in over $1 billion in 2014, and that commercial bookings in 2015 almost doubled year-over-year.But with buzz certainly comes controversy. In September 2016, Palantir was sued by the U.S. Department of Labor for discriminating against Asian applicants by routinely eliminating them in the screening process; Palantir recently settled, and will need to pay nearly $1.7 million in ""back pay and other monetary relief.”For now, talks of a Palantir IPO remain a combination of speculation and anticipation. Last October, Karp told The Wall Street Journal that the company was “positioned so [it] could go public,” a positive sign that Palantir could hit the market in the near future. And with its Big Data-focused business—something that will only become more prevalent with the rise of artificial intelligence—unique user base, and fundamentally secretive operations, Palantir’s potential IPO could be one for the books.An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that Garry Tan was a co-founder of Palantir; he came on board as employee number 10. This version has been corrected.<!--{cke_protected}{C}%3C!%2D%2Dtd%20%7Bborder%3A%201px%20solid%20%23ccc%3B%7Dbr%20%7Bmso-data-placement%3Asame-cell%3B%7D%2D%2D%3E-->Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

107,HSY,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for The Hershey Company  (HSY  -  Free Report). Shares have added about 4.5% in that time frame, outperforming the market.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Third Quarter 2017 Results Hershey’s earnings and revenues beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in third-quarter 2017. Growth in its core brands, successful innovation and progress in multi-year productivity, and cost-saving initiatives drove the outperformance. Earnings & Revenue Discussion Hershey’s third-quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.33 beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.28 by 3.9%. Earnings also improved from the year-ago level of $1.29 by 3.1%. Net sales of $2.03 billion surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2 billion. Net sales also improved 1.5% year over year owing to strong demand for Kisses, Kit Kat and Chocolate Dipped Pretzels. This marked the sixth straight quarter of sales rise after a few quarters of no growth. Organically, excluding the impact of currency, sales increased 1.1% as demand strengthened in the United States. Volume grew 0.7%, while net price realization had a 0.4% benefit. Currency favorably impacted revenues by 0.4%. Quarterly Segment Discussion North America (United States and Canada) net sales increased 1.6% to $1.79 billion and currency drove sales by 0.3%. Pricing made a 0.3% positive impact, while volumes contributed 1.6%. Third-quarter net sales at the International and Other segment grew 0.8% to $240.7 million. Currency had a positive impact on sales of 1.3%. Excluding currency, sales declined 0.5% due to pricing gains. While volumes posed a 5.2% headwind, pricing benefited sales by 4.7%. Constant currency sales were solid (about 8%) in Mexico, Brazil and India. Net sales in China remained on par with the year-ago level. Margins Detail Hershey’s adjusted gross margin declined 30 basis points (bps) to 45.3% due to higher freight rates as well as manufacturing and distribution costs. Again, unfavorable sales mix had a negative impact on gross margins. Cost of sales dropped 5.2% to $1.1 billion in the third quarter. Again, total advertising and related consumer marketing expenses increased 3.7% from the third-quarter 2016 level. Adjusted operating margin contracted 30 bps to 22%. The adjusted effective tax rate was 30.4%, lower than 30.7% in the prior-year quarter. Hershey’s also approved a new $100-million stock repurchase authorization. 2017 Guidance Net sales are expected to increase around 1.25%. Adjusted gross margin will likely increase about 25 bps compared with the prior expectation of about 50 bps. The company now expects foreign currency to have a neutral effect on sales. Previously, it was expected at around 0.25%. The company reaffirmed its adjusted EPS guidance at the range of $4.72-$4.81, reflecting a 7-9% increase from last year.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then? Fresh estimates followed a downward path over the past two months.VGM ScoresCurrently, Hershey's stock has a subpar Growth Score of D, however its Momentum is doing a bit better with a C. However, the stock was allocated a grade of D on the value side, putting it in the bottom 40% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of F. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.The company's stock is suitable solely for momentum based on our styles scores.OutlookThe stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We are expecting an inline return from the stock in the next few months.

108,HSY,"In line with the strategy to diversify its organic offerings, Kellogg Company (K  -  Free Report) entered into an agreement to acquire protein bar maker, Chicago Bar Company.Chicago Bar Company makes RXBAR, which is considered the fastest growing nutrition bar brand in the United States.Transaction DetailsThe acquisition, valued at $600 million or $400 million net of tax benefits, is anticipated to close by 2017-end. Chicago Bar Company will operate as an independent business within Kellogg.RXBAR expects to generate net sales of $120 million in fiscal 2017. Kellogg expects the multiple on projected 2018 EBITDA to be in the 12x-14x range, inclusive of the tax benefits to the purchase price. The acquisition however will not be accretive to earnings in 2017 and 2018, excluding one-time costs.Buyout BenefitsThe addition of “clean-label, high-protein” RXBAR can be expected to revive Kellogg’s wholesome snacks business, which has been weak over the past few quarters. The U.S. snacks business has been struggling since 2013 owing to weak volumes. Though Pringles has been performing well, the deterioration in U.S. snacks is stemming from weakness in weight-management products like Special K bars, Special K cracker chips and Right Bites' 100-calorie cookie packs. In the first six months of 2017, the snacks segment’s net sales dropped 3% year over year.Kellogg is poised to benefit from RXBAR’s immense brand appeal and strong online presence. RXBAR, on the other hand, will be able to capitalize on Kellogg's scale and resources to accelerate growth.Kellogg is innovating and diversifying its line of offerings to keep up with changing consumer needs and counter the weak sales trajectory, similar to food giants like General Mills Inc. (GIS  -  Free Report), Conagra Brands Inc. (CAG  -  Free Report) and The Hershey Company (HSY  -  Free Report).Persistently soft sales have led to a 18.4% decline in the company’s shares in the past year. The stock has also been trading below its industry. Current-year estimates for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock went down 0.3% in the last 30 days but remained stable for next year. Though Kellogg is facing tepid sales, such organic products can be expected to boost demand.  Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.     Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021. Early investors stand to make a killing, but you have to be ready to act and know just where to look.   See the pot trades we're targeting>>

109,HSY,"Palantir Technologies is a privately-held software and services company that has taken Silicon Valley by storm since its launch back in 2004. It was founded by Peter Thiel, Nathan Gettings, Joe Lonsdale, Stephen Cohen, and Alex Karp (now CEO) with the idea of “creating the world’s best user experience for working with data, one that empowers people to ask and answer complex questions without requiring them to master querying languages, statistical modeling, or the command line.”While its name is derived from the palantÍr, a “seeing stone” in J.R.R. Tolkein’s fantasy series Lord of the Rings—even its motto is “Save the Shire,” in reference to the home of the hobbits of Middle Earth—Palantir actually emerged from mobile payments giant PayPal’s (PYPL  -  Free Report) anti-fraud efforts (its co-founder Thiel also co-founded PayPal).It’s also often considered to be one of the most secretive tech unicorns out there today. And by secretive, I mean a couple of things. For one, many people just haven’t heard of the company, especially outside of the tech and investing worlds; its Big Data focus is not nearly as flashy and exciting as ride-hailing or home-sharing. For another, Palantir and its technology is still best known for antiterrorism and spycraft, two avenues that must be secretive in order to thrive. It’s “Minority Report come true,” writes The Guardian.What They DoIf you have heard of Palantir, then you know that the company’s technology has been used in several notable cases, including the discovery of the infamous Chinese espionage networks, GhostNet and the Shadow Network. There’s also their rumored-but-never-confirmed efforts to help take down Osama Bin Laden.Even though its role in Bin Laden’s takedown will likely never be established as fact, what can be recognized, however, is Palantir’s extensive relationship with the U.S. government. Just as recently as six years ago, Palantir sold exclusively to the government sector.  The FBI, CIA, IRS, CDC, Department of Homeland Security, Department of Defense, and several branches of the armed forces have all been customers, and up to 50% of the company’s business is tied to the public sector. Even In-Q-Tel, the CIA’s venture arm, was an early investor.For instance, The Guardian goes on to note that the Pentagon “used Palantir software [in Iraq] to track patterns in roadside bomb deployment and worked out garage-door openers were being used as remote detonators by predicting it.”Palantir also has commercial customers that rely on them to detect fraud, study consumer behavior, and search for a competitive edge against rivals; these clients include JPMorgan Chase (JPM  -  Free Report), Hershey (HSY  -  Free Report), and Bridgewater Associates, a global investment management firm, among others. Overall, private customers make up about 75% of Palantir’s revenue, notes Fortune.Big Data PioneerAs a whole, Palantir prides itself on being one of the world’s Big Data solutions experts. It’s a term that refers to a collection of structured and multi-structured data from traditional and digital sources inside and outside a company, representing a source for ongoing discovery and analysis. Examples of structured data include tweets (TWTR  -  Free Report) and other social media posts, while multi-structured data is something that can be derived from interactions between people and machines.To help tackle Big Data, Palantir created two software suites for which it’s best known for. Formerly known as Palantir Finance, Palantir Metropolis is software for data integration, information management, and quantitative analytics. The software connects to commercial, proprietary, and public data sets and discovery trends, relationships and anomalies, including predictive analytics. And yes, this software suite is named after the home city of Superman.For users like hedge funds, banks, and financial services firms, Metropolis provides a number of integrated applications in order to build up interactive models using all the data that is available in their system. This includes Custom Metric, Dashboard, Date Set, Explorer, Regression, and Spreadsheet applications.The other is Palantir Gotham, formerly known as Palantir Government. This software integrates structured and unstructured data, provides search and discovery capabilities, knowledge management, and secure collaboration. Like Metropolis, Gotham is named after the home city of fellow superhero Batman.Gotham provides a suite of tools that are optimized for semantic, temporal, geospatial, and full-text analysis. Users can seamlessly drag and drop data objects from one application to the next, and applications include Graphs, Maps, Object Explorer, Browser, and Mobile.IPO BuzzWith a valuation at $20 billion, Palantir is one of the world’s most valuable venture-backed tech startups, but the company has yet to lay out any specific plans for an initial public offering. However, that hasn’t stopped IPO buzz from building, and investors have been excited for a while now about the potential for a Palantir market debut.The hype grew even more once President Trump took office, as co-founder Thiel is one of his closest tech advisors and CEO Karp joined with some of the industry’s biggest names—including executives from Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report), and Facebook (FB  -  Free Report), just to name a few—during the president’s transition period.Despite its impressive valuation and presidential connections, Palantir is still not profitable, though the company expects to reach profitability in 2017. Palantir doesn’t report current revenue, but according to Fortune, it brought in over $1 billion in 2014, and that commercial bookings in 2015 almost doubled year-over-year.But with buzz certainly comes controversy. In September 2016, Palantir was sued by the U.S. Department of Labor for discriminating against Asian applicants by routinely eliminating them in the screening process; Palantir recently settled, and will need to pay nearly $1.7 million in ""back pay and other monetary relief.”For now, talks of a Palantir IPO remain a combination of speculation and anticipation.

110,HSY,"On Aug 18, we issued an updated research report on The Hershey Company (HSY  -  Free Report), the leading chocolate manufacturer of North America.Hershey’s second-quarter 2017 earnings and revenues surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Earnings also increased 28.2% from the year-ago level on higher sales, solid gross margin expansion and operating income improvement in the International segment. Net sales also improved 1.5% year over year owing to strong performance by the North America segment and the acquisition of barkTHINS brand. This marks the fifth straight quarter of sales improvement after a few quarters of no growth.Hershey’s shares have gained 4.3% so far this year compared to its industry’s 21.8% decline. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s earnings estimates for 2017 remained stable over the last 30 days. Notably, Hershey has been able to beat earnings estimates in all of the past four quarters. The company’s productivity improvement and cost-saving initiatives should drive the stock’s performance as well.Key PositivesHershey regularly brings innovation to its core brands to meet consumer needs. Its initiatives have been able to drive net sales by 2.2% so far this year.The company’s new cost savings program, Margin for Growth, bodes well. As part of the multi-year program, it will reduce its global workforce outside the U.S. by 15%. It will also improve the overall operating margin through supply chain optimization, a streamlined operating model and reduced administrative expenses, with savings likely to be recorded in 2018 and 2019.These moves are anticipated to boost efficiency, leverage global shared services and common processes and increase capacity utilization. For 2017, Hershey expects $25 million in savings from the Margin for Growth program, more than $15 million anticipated earlier.ConcernsThe North American food industry has been witnessing sluggish growth and slowdown in consumption over the last few quarters. The industry is experiencing changes in consumer preference toward organic food items. As a result, Hershey, like a number of U.S. food producers like Mondelez International, Inc. (MDLZ  -  Free Report), B&G Foods, Inc. (BGS  -  Free Report) and General Mills, Inc. (GIS  -  Free Report), has been grappling with declining demand.Moreover, weak consumer shopping trends and the softening chocolate category trends have been hurting Hershey’s sales in China since 2015. China’s foreign exchange-neutral sales declined 29% in the second quarter of 2017 due to continued softness in the chocolate category throughout modern trade and select SKU rationalization.4 Surprising Tech Stocks to Keep an Eye onTech stocks have been a major force behind the market’s record highs, but picking the best ones to buy can be tough.

112,HSY,"The Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report) is slated to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 25, before the opening bell.Coca-Cola has been struggling to boost sales amid weak demand in certain emerging and developing markets and shift in consumer preference. The company has been witnessing a decline in revenues for the last nine quarters, primarily due to weak volumes especially in the sparkling beverage category, and structural changes.Coca-Cola’s second-quarter revenues declined 16% year over year due to currency headwinds and negative impact of structural items. Acquisitions/divestitures and structural items had a 17% impact on revenues, while currency headwinds hurt sales by 2%. The company’s soon-to-be reported quarter is also expected to be adversely impacted by 19-20% in net revenues from acquisitions, divestitures, and other structural items. The company also expects currency headwinds to hurt quarterly net revenues by 1-2%.Segment Discussion: North America, comprising about 30% of the total revenues, is expected to see tepid growth in third quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment revenues of $2.6 billion reflect growth of 1% from the year-ago quarter.Latin America revenues are likely to witness 4.8% growth. On the other hand, consensus estimate for Europe, Middle East and Africa segment revenues of $1.9 billion indicates a decrease of 7.1% from the prior quarter and Bottling Investments revenues are likely to decrease 54% year over year. Again, Asia Pacific revenues are expected to decrease 0.4% on a year-over-year basis.Coming to the company’s bottom line, i.e. EPS, the cola giant has surpassed analysts’ expectations for earnings in 12 of the past 13 quarters. However, the company’s adjusted EPS, excluding one-time items, have fallen for the past nine consecutive quarters.As mentioned earlier, Coca-Cola expects net impact of acquisitions, divestitures, and other structural items to have a headwind of 9-10% on profits before taxes in the to-be-reported quarter. Currency fluctuations are anticipated to have an adverse impact of 2-3% on quarterly profits before taxes.That said, Coca-Cola is taking aggressive cost-cutting and strategic measures to mitigate the impact of lower sales and weak volumes. Adjusted consolidated gross margins expanded 210 basis points (bps) year over year to 62.6% in the second quarter of 2017, as currency headwinds were offset by positive pricing and productivity gains. We expect to witness similar trends in the to-be reported quarter as well.Overall, the beverage behemoth’s third-quarter revenues/profits are likely to decline owing to structural changes and currency headwind. We feel pricing gains, cost cuts and productivity savings should continue to support bottom line to some extent. The refranchising efforts, though hurting sales/profits in the near term, will result in higher operating margins, lower capital spending, and improved return on invested capital in the long run by reducing exposure to the low-margin bottling operations.For the third quarter, Coca-Cola’s Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 49 cents, reflecting a 0.7% year-over-year decrease. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues is pegged at $8.84 billion, implying 16.9% decline.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:Coca-Cola has the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — which is required to be confident of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.  Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Coca-Cola is +0.17%.Zacks Rank: Coca-Cola carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which increases the predictive power of ESP.Coca-Cola Company (The) Price and EPS Surprise  Coca-Cola Company (The) Price and EPS Surprise | Coca-Cola Company (The) QuoteStocks Worth a LookHere are a few consumer staples stocks you may consider, as they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.The Hershey Company (HSY  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.13% and a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

114,HSY,"The Procter & Gamble Company (PG  -  Free Report)) is set to report first-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Oct 20, before the market opens. This consumer goods company has exceeded analysts’ expectations for nine consecutive quarters despite lower sales.The company has been struggling to boost sales for the last few years. Weak volumes and slowing market growth along with foreign exchange headwind have been hurting its sales. Soft consumer-spending environment in developed markets, particularly in the United States and the United Kingdom, also adds to the worries.The trend is unlikely to change for the to-be-reported quarter. Softness in the United States, United Kingdom and volatility in developing markets is likely to adversely impact Procter & Gamble’s results. In fact, categories in the company’s largest and most profitable market, the United States (accounting for 42% of total net sales in fiscal 2017), grew barely above flat in fiscal fourth-quarter 2017. The U.S. market growth slowed to just above 1% in fiscal 2017 from over 2% in fiscal 2016. Overall, the company expects fiscal 2018 organic sales growth of 2-3%.Importantly, Procter & Gamble expects first quarter to witness the lowest organic sales and core earnings per share (EPS) growth of the year, as the period compares against the highest organic growth base period. Top-line headwinds from portfolio choices and the recent Gillette price reduction in the United States will primarily impact the first half of fiscal-2018 results.Segment Discussion: Fabric & Home Care, comprising about 32% of the total revenues, is expected to get a boost in the first quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Fabric & Home Care revenues of $5.4 billion reflect growth of 3.5% sequentially and 1.3% from the year-ago quarter. The consensus estimate for Baby, Feminine & Family Care revenues of $4.6 billion indicates an increase of 0.5% from the prior-year quarter.Again, revenues from Beauty segment are expected to increase 2.1% on a year-over-year basis. Health Care revenues will most likely witness 0.9% growth. However, Grooming revenues is likely to register 2.1% year-over-year revenue decline.Here are the other factors that might influence Procter & Gamble’s Q1 results:To counter the tepid sales growth, Procter & Gamble has been benefiting from its ongoing restructuring program aimed at reducing costs and driving efficiency. The company has been taking various restructuring initiatives aimed at generating higher profit and lowering costs. These initiatives have helped the company to accelerate margins growth amid the slowdown in sales.The company’s focus on reducing its SG&A (selling, general, and administrative) costs and lowering its marketing and advertising spending could boost its operating margins in the coming quarters.However, lower pricing owing to increased competition in the shave care category, higher commodity costs, a tough retail environment, an unfavorable mix, and year-over-year comparables are anticipated to continue being a drag in its bottom-line growth rate.For the fiscal first quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $1.07, reflecting an increase of 4.3% year over year. Meanwhile, the consensus estimate for revenues is pegged at $16.6 billion, implying a 0.8% growth.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:Procter & Gamble has the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — which is required to be confident of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Procter & Gamble is +0.33%.Zacks Rank: Procter & Gamble carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP.Procter & Gamble Company (The) Price and EPS Surprise  Procter & Gamble Company (The) Price and EPS Surprise | Procter & Gamble Company (The) QuoteStocks Worth a LookHere are a few consumer staples stocks worth considering as they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.The Hershey Company (HSY  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.13% and carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

115,HSY,"The time is ripe for picking chocolate stocks as cocoa prices continue to melt down. This is primarily due to copious supply and fading demand, as growing health consciousness continues to grip consumers. As per a recent Bernstein research, the price of cocoa has plunged 37% since last summer and is expected to trickle down for the next few years.This makes The Hershey Company (HSY  -  Free Report), the largest chocolate manufacturer in North America as well as a global leader in chocolate and non-chocolate confectionery, a special treat for chocolate investors.Analyst Alexia Howard of Bernstein stated, “Easing cocoa prices could be a major tailwind as we move out into 2018, more than offsetting the relatively mild inflation in dairy prices.” This is assuming that cocoa comprises an estimated 10% to 15% of Hershey’s cost of goods sold or COGS. Also, considering that cocoa will account for 10% of Hershey COGS, Howard's estimates a 30% decline in input prices, which in turn is likely to boost gross margin to 47.8% from 46.2% in a year, thereby lifting earnings per share by 8.6% or 42 cents.Moreover, Howard’s thesis is backed by the U.S. chocolate industry’s growth prospects driven by the snacking trends among millennials and more product innovation, as Mondelez International Inc. (MDLZ  -  Free Report) increased its competition.What Hershey’s Q2 Numbers Have to SayHershey’s second-quarter 2017 earnings per share improved from the year-ago profit level by 28.2%, driven by higher sales, solid gross margin expansion and operating income improvement in the International segment.More precisely, the company’s adjusted gross margin expanded 160 basis points (bps) to 47.1%. The company stressed that this upside was driven by supply chain productivity, cost-saving initiatives and lower input costs. For the full year, the chocolate maker also expects adjusted gross margin to rise about 50 bps, buoyed by lower input costs (higher than earlier anticipated) and by productivity and cost-savings initiatives. These positives is likely to offset fixed costs volume absorption due to lower sales, unfavorable product mix and the rollout of new packaging formats.It is to be borne in mind, Hershey has been reporting weak top-line growth for the last few years due to persistent macroeconomic challenges in China as well as a shift in consumer preference toward products with less artificial sweeteners, sodium and saturated fat. As a result, Hershey, like a number of U.S. food producers such as Mondelez, B&G Foods, Inc. (BGS  -  Free Report) and General Mills, Inc. (GIS  -  Free Report), has been grappling with declining demand.That said, the company’s net sales improved 1.5% year over year in the second quarter owing to strong performance by the North America segment and the acquisition of barkTHINS brand. This marks the fifth straight quarter of sales rise after a few quarters of no growth.Again, adjusted operating profit increased about 16.9% from the year-ago period, resulting in operating profit margin of 20.8%, an increase of 270 basis points. The increase was driven by higher gross profit and lower SG&A due to productivity and cost savings.Other Relevant MetricsHershey’s shares have gained 1.7% so far this year compared with the industry’s decline of 22.5%. Estimates for 2017 and 2018 have remained stable over the last 30 days. Hershey has been able to beat earnings estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, resulting in an average positive surprise of 10.35%. The company’s productivity improvements and cost-saving initiatives should drive the stock’s performance in the upcoming quarters as well.Moreover, sales and earnings for the current year is expected to increase nearly 1.1% and 8.9%, respectively. This top-line as well as bottom-line performance is reflected in the growth style score ranked B. Overall, Hershey has a VGM Score of B.Hershey’s ROE of 119.7% compared with the industry average of 9.7% manifests the company’s efficiency in utilizing shareholder’s funds. Again, based on last day's closing price of $105.16 per share, the company's current dividend yield is 2.49%, a lot higher than the industry’s 0.00%.Hence, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has good prospects and is expected to make value addition to your portfolio.

117,HSY,"B&G Foods Inc. (BGS  -  Free Report) is set to report second-quarter 2017 results on Aug 3, after market close.Last quarter, this NJ-based shelf-stable and frozen food company posted a positive earnings surprise of 5.45%. However, the company surpassed estimates in three of the past four quarters, resulting in an average positive surprise of 1.95%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderA look at estimate revisions lends us an idea of analyst expectations right before a company’s earnings release. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter earnings per share remained stable over the past 30 days at 49 cents. This reflects a year-over-year decrease of 41.9%. The stock also saw dismal trading over the past three months, with the share price slipping 11.7%.B&G Foods’ weak base business growth raises concern. The company's base sales declined 2% in 2016 and 2.4% in the first quarter of 2017, thanks to declining unit volumes. Also, the North American food industry has been witnessing sluggish growth and slowdown in consumption over the last few quarters due to a shift in consumer preference toward healthier options.Meanwhile, we are encouraged by the company’s aggressive acquisition strategy, cost-saving initiatives and productivity improvements. In 2016, the company's sales increased 44%, while in the first quarter it had risen 18.4%. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $382.70 million, implying a 24.9% increase.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that B&G Foods will beat estimates this quarter.

Earnings grew 15.3% year over year on significant gains because of cost-savings initiatives.SalesReported sales of $6.68 billion fell shy of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.69 billion marginally by 0.2% and also declined 1.7% year over year due to soft consumer demand in North America and Canada. Notably, Kraft Heinz’s sales have now declined in five of the last six quarters and the company expects sales growth to ramp up in the second half of 2017. The reported figure includes an unfavorable 0.8% impact from currency.Organically (excluding currency), sales declined 0.9%.Volume/mix decreased 0.5% in the quarter against a 3.7% decrease in the previous quarter. The slump was due to weak demand of cheese, meats, and food services in its biggest market, the U.S. However, these were partly offset by positive contributions from condiments and sauces in all business segments. Pricing declined 0.4% in the quarter compared with 1% increase in the preceding quarter.The company has been witnessing weakness in top line for the last several quarters. Soft spending by U.S. shoppers along with rapid changes in consumer preferences and behavior are hurting the company’s categories. Kraft Heinz, like many other U.S. food producers, Mondelez International, Inc. (MDLZ  -  Free Report) and General Mills, Inc.

124,HSY,"The Q2 earnings season has picked up pace, with 97 companies in the S&P 500 cohort having released their quarterly numbers. According to the latest Earnings Preview, total earnings for these companies are up 8.4% from the same period last year on 5.1% higher revenues, with 78.4% beating earnings estimates and 72.2% surpassing revenue estimates.Total Q2 earnings are expected to be up +8.6% from the same period last year on a 4.7% revenue improvement. Coming to the Consumer Staples sector, earnings are expected to increase 3.1% in Q2 compared with 4.7% in the previous quarter. Revenues are expected to rise 1.2%, lower than 3% recorded in the last quarter.The Food industry, within the Consumer Staples sector, has been performing dismally for quite some time now. Major U.S. food companies are striving to retain market share as easy-to-prepare and ready-to-eat convenience food items are gradually losing ground. A shift in consumer preference toward healthier options and a higher level of price consciousness is hurting the industry, making it hard for legacy brands like General Mills Inc. (GIS  -  Free Report) to boost sales. Nonetheless, effective promotional strategies, introduction of nutritious products, cost-saving and restructuring initiatives might prove beneficial for the food industry at large.Coming to the Beverage (soft drinks) industry within the Consumer Staples sector, persistent decline in carbonated soft drinks or CSDs and impressive growth in noncarbonated beverages are raising concerns for established players like PepsiCo Inc. (PEP  -  Free Report).  Cola companies are gradually reshuffling their portfolio toward healthier options to counter the tepid sales and volumes environment.Given this backdrop, let’s try to determine how these players – The Hershey Company (HSY  -  Free Report) and The Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report) – are placed ahead of their second-quarter earnings releases before the opening bell on Jul 26.Hershey, the largest North American manufacturer of quality chocolate and confectionery products, reported a positive 3.97% earnings surprise in the last quarter. Also, the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 7.65%.Currently, the company has an Earnings ESP of -3.30% as the Most Accurate estimate is 88 cents, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged higher at 91 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Hershey Company (The) Price and EPS Surprise  Hershey Company (The) Price and EPS Surprise | Hershey Company (The) QuoteAlso, Hershey carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Notably, Hershey has been delivering weak performance in international markets since 2015, primarily due to soft results in China. In fact, China chocolate category sales in the first quarter was flat and also below the market level. The company had earlier expressed that considering the timing of Easter and the projected decline in China sales, second-quarter net sales growth is expected to lag the full-year growth rate (read more: Hershey Q2 Earnings: Disappointment in the Cards?)For the second quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 91 cents, reflecting an increase of 6.5% year over year, while the consensus for revenues is at $1.65 billion, implying 0.9% year-over-year growth.Soft drink giant, Coca-Cola posted a negative earnings surprise of 2.27% in the last quarter. However, the company managed to surpass earnings estimates in three of the last four quarters, with an average surprise of 1.51%. Per our model, the company is likely to disappoint this earnings season as it has an Earnings ESP of -1.72% and a Zacks #3.Coca-Cola Company (The) Price and EPS Surprise  Coca-Cola Company (The) Price and EPS Surprise | Coca-Cola Company (The) QuoteThe company’s net revenue is also expected to face a 17–18% negative impact from acquisitions, divestitures and other structural items.

125,HSY,"The Hershey Company (HSY  -  Free Report) is slated to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 26, before the opening bell. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 3.97%.The chocolate maker surpassed earnings estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 7.65%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors to ConsiderChanges in consumer preference and consumer dynamics, demographic shifts, and also a spending shift toward lower-priced products have been a dampener for Hershey’s sales since 2014.To add to the woes, Hershey has been delivering weak performance in international markets since 2015, primarily due to soft results in China. In fact, China chocolate category sales in the first quarter was flat and also below the market.Nevertheless, Hershey regularly innovates its core brands to meet consumer demand and needs that are not addressed by its current portfolio. The company’s initiatives have been bearing fruit of late, with net sales increasing 2.8% year over year in the first quarter. This marks the fourth straight rise in quarterly sales after a few quarters of no growth.Given this changing scenario, we expect Hershey to see modest sales growth in the to-be-reported quarter.The company had earlier expressed that given the timing of Easter and the expected lower sales in China, second-quarter net sales growth is expected to be lower than full-year growth rate. For 2017, net sales are expected to be at the low end of the previously stated range of 2–3%.To counter the soft sales environment, major food companies like Mondelez International, Inc. (MDLZ  -  Free Report), Kellogg Company (K  -  Free Report), and The Kraft Heinz Company (KHC  -  Free Report) have been relying on productivity savings to boost its bottom line. Hershey too is banking on restructuring initiatives, which will likely help the company increase its EPS despite weak sales growth.Hershey’s adjusted gross margin and operating margin expanded 70 basis points (bps) and 170 bps, respectively, in the first quarter driven by favorable trade, supply chain productivity and costs-saving initiatives and lower input costs. The trend is expected in the to-be-reported quarter as well.Overall, Hershey will likely register higher quarterly EPS depending on its ability to increase prices, along with productivity and cost-cutting initiatives.For the second quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 91 cents, reflecting an increase of 6.5% year over year, while the consensus for revenues is at $1.65 billion, implying 0.9% year-over-year growth.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Hershey is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is -3.30%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is 88 cents, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 91 cents.Zacks Rank: Hershey currently carries a Zacks Rank #3. Although a Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP, a negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Ranks #4 and 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Hershey Company (The) Price and EPS Surprise  Hershey Company (The) Price and EPS Surprise | Hershey Company (The) QuoteMore Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

126,HSY,"On Jul 14, 2017, we issued an updated research report on The Hershey Company (HSY  -  Free Report), the leading chocolate manufacturer in North America.Hershey’s shares have outperformed the Zacks categorized Food-Confectionary industry year to date. The company’s shares have gained around 1.3%, while the broader industry declined 10.2%.The company’s strong brand portfolio, focus on innovation and productivity improvements and cost savings programs are encouraging. However, the changing North American food industry raises concern.Cost Saving Plans Combatting Weak SalesThe North American food industry has been witnessing sluggish growth and slowdown in consumption for the last few quarters. The industry is experiencing changes in consumer preference (for example, shift toward products with less artificial sweeteners, sodium and saturated fat), changes in consumer dynamics, demographic shifts, and also a spending shift toward lower-priced products.Given these changes, Hershey, like a number of U.S. food producers namely Mondelez International, Inc. (MDLZ  -  Free Report), ConAgra Foods Inc. (CAG  -  Free Report) and food giant General Mills, Inc. (GIS  -  Free Report), has been facing the brunt of shifting consumer preference.Hershey has been experiencing top-line pressure since 2014. In 2016, the company’s sales experienced a meager 0.7% growth. Meanwhile, the U.S. chocolate category is gradually slowing. In fact, the company is witnessing chocolate category softness in key international markets such as China. The chocolate category sales in China were flat and below the market level in first-quarter 2017.Nevertheless, Hershey regularly brings innovation to its core brands to meet consumer demand and needs that are not addressed by its current portfolio. The company’s initiatives have been bearing fruit of late with net sales increasing 2.8% year over year in the first quarter. This marks the fourth straight rise in quarterly sales after few quarters of no growth.Again, under its continuous improvement and productivity (CIP) program, management has optimized its North American manufacturing footprint, added manufacturing capabilities in international markets, increased supply chain productivity, invested in cost saving projects and improved the sales mix significantly.The productivity and cost savings from these efforts are being invested in brand building and supporting growth and gaining marketplace insights, which in turn are boosting the company’s margins.In the last reported quarter, Hershey’s adjusted gross margin expanded 70 basis points (bps) to 47.5% buoyed by favorable trade, supply chain productivity and costs-savings initiatives and lower input costs, which offset other higher supply chain costs. Operating margin also expanded 170 bps to 23.2%.Additionally, the company unveiled a new cost-savings program, Margin for Growth, to boost profitability. The international division is expected to significantly narrow its operating loss in 2018 on the back of the new cost-reduction program.As part of its Margin for Growth multi-year program, it will reduce its global workforce outside the U.S. by 15%. This multi-year program is intended to improve overall operating margin through supply chain optimization, a streamlined operating model and reduced administrative expenses, with savings primarily being achieved in 2018 and 2019. These moves are anticipated to boost efficiency, leverage global shared services and common processes and increase capacity utilization.These initiatives will enable Hershey to achieve its adjusted operating profit margin target of around 22–23% by 2019. The company will incur pre-tax charges of $375 million to $425 million, and provide benefits between $80 million and $100 million from the layoffs.Hershey holds a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

130,HSY,"Generally, investors love stocks with a low price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. The perception is that the lower the P/E, the higher is the value of the stock. The simple logic that a stock’s current market price does not justify (is not equivalent to) its higher earnings and therefore has room to run is behind investors’ inclination toward low P/E stocks.But stocks with a rising P/E can be equally worth buying. We’ll tell you why.Why Rising P/E a Valuable Tool?Investors should note that stock price moves in tandem with earnings performance. If earnings come in stronger, the price of a stock shoots up. Solid quarterly earnings and the forward guidance boost earnings forecasts, leading to stronger demand for the stock and an uptrend in its price.So, if the price is rising steadily, it means that investors are assured of the stock’s fundamental strength and expect some strong positives out of it. Also, studies have revealed that stocks have seen their P/E ratios jump over 100% from their breakout point in the cycle. So, if you can pick stocks early in their breakout cycle, you can end up seeing considerable gains.The Winning StrategyIn order to shortlist stocks that are exhibiting an increasing P/E, we chose the following as our primary screening parameters.EPS growth estimate for the current year is greater than or equal to last year’s actual growthPercentage change in last year EPS should be greater than or equal zero(These two criteria point to flat earnings or a growth trend over the years.)Percentage change in price over four weeks greater than the percentage change in price over 12 weeksPercentage change in price over 12 weeks greater than the percentage change in price over 24 weeks(These two criteria show that price of the stock is increasing consistently over the said timeframes.)Percentage price change for four weeks relative to the S&P 500 greater than the percentage price change for 12 weeks relative to the S&P 500Percentage price change for 12 weeks relative to the S&P 500 greater than the percentage price change for 24 weeks relative to the S&P 500(Here, the case for consistent price gains gets even stronger as it displays percentage price changes relative to the S&P 500.)Percentage price change for 12 weeks is 20% higher than or equal to the percentage price change for 24 weeks, but it should not exceed 100%(A 20% increase in the price of a stock from the breakout point gives cues of an impending uptrend. But a jump of over 100% indicates that there is limited scope for further upside and that the stock might be due for a reversal.).In addition, we place a few other criteria that lead us to some likely outperformers.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Only companies with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) rating can get through. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Average 20-day Volume greater than or equal to 50,000: High trading volume implies that the stocks have adequate liquidity.Just these few criteria narrowed down the universe from over 7,700 stocks to just 40.Here are five out of the 40 stocks:The Hershey Company (HSY  -  Free Report)): This is a global confectionary company.

Trump’s announcement in early March that the United States will impose a 25% tariff on steel imports and a 10% tariff on aluminum imports first spooked the market.The situation eased a little when Trump administration granted a temporary relief from tariffs to some of its key allies like European Union, Canada, Mexico, Argentina, Australia, Brazil and South Korea. However, China was not part of that exemption and a tussle over trade with China has been going on since March (read: ETFs to be Impacted by Trump's Tariff Exemptions).Trump Flip-Flops on Trade United States and China announced a $50-billion import tariff on each other, only to put the war “on hold” for a while. Then again, at May-end, Washington announced a 25% tariff on $50 billion worth of goods from China and imposed new limits on Chinese investments in the United States (read: Trump, Tariff & Geopolitics Lead May: 10 Top ETF Stories).Plus, tariffs on metal imports from the EU, Canada and Mexico will be put into effect from Jun 1, as exemption offered earlier in the year lapsed. Needless to say, the United States now needs to be prepared for a chain of tit-for-tat tariffs on a range of products.Retaliations in Cue Mexico has already retaliated by levying measures on U.S. farm and industrial products, targeting pork legs, apples, grapes and cheeses. Investors should note that about 22% of U.S. pork is exported out of which Mexico buys the maximum.Canada plans to slam retaliatory tariffs on $12.8 billion worth of U.S. exports and contest the steel and aluminum tariffs under the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the World Trade Organization (WTO), per Reuters. The EU is also planning a legal challenge via the WTO.Against this backdrop, we highlight some industries that could be impacted the most by the tariffs.Food and Meat Producers The S&P 500 Packaged Foods and Meats index shed about 2% on the retaliation news, per Reuters. A professor of agricultural economics at Purdue expects this tariff along with supply glut in the meat market to cause average losses for U.S. hog farmers of about $9 per animal in 2018 and $13 in 2019. No wonder, Tyson Foods Inc. TSN, processor and marketer of chicken, beef, and pork, lost about 4.3% on May 31 on Mexico’s tit-for-tat tariff announcement.  Food and beverage companies like Kraft Heinz Company KHC (down 2.3% on May 31) and Hormel Foods Corporation HRL (down 3.4% on May 31) also featured in the losers’ list.Consumer Staples ETFs like First Trust Nasdaq Food & Beverage ETF FTXG, First Trust Consumer Staples AlphaDEX Fund (FXG  -  Free Report), VanEck Vectors Agribusiness ETF MOO and PowerShares Dynamic Food and Beverage (PBJ  -  Free Report) and S&P 500 Equal Weight Consumer Staples Portfolio (RHS  -  Free Report) have exposure to the afore-mentioned companies and could thus be hit hard.Semiconductor U.S. chipmakers have the largest sales exposure to China. So, renewed tariff tensions with China could bring back pain in the semiconductor space. iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF (SOXX  -  Free Report) was down about 0.7% on May 31 (read: 4 Best Performing Sector ETFs of May).AerospaceU.S. aerospace industry thrives on steel and aluminum imports to construct aircraft. About 80% of an aircraft is made of aluminum. Companies like Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) (down 1.7%) and Lockheed Martin (LMT  -  Free Report) (down 1.9%) may come under pressure.Also, China is a key market for Boeing where it serves as the largest exporter of America. So, any tension with China doesn’t bode well for Boeing. Aerospace and defense ETFs like iShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense ETF (ITA  -  Free Report) and SPDR S&P Aerospace & Defense ETF (XAR  -  Free Report) may also feel the pinch.CandyAluminum foils are used to wrap chocolates. So, the tariff could lead to higher input costs for Hershey Company HSY (down 1.7%) and Mondelez International Inc. MDLZ (down 0.9%).BeerImported aluminum is used to make beer cans. Companies like Molson Coors Brewing Company (TAP  -  Free Report) (down 1.1%) and Constellation Brands Inc. STZ) (down 0.8%) may face the rising cost issue. At the same time, the announcement puts Spirited Funds/ETFMG Whiskey & Spirits ETF  in focus.Auto Both steel and aluminum are vital to the production of cars and trucks sold in America and would drive the sale prices of those vehicles considerably. Also, the Trump administration has initiated a national security investigation into auto imports. All these put First Trust NASDAQ Global Auto Index Fund (CARZ  -  Free Report) in an edgy spot (read: U.S. Auto Tariff Risk Put These ETFs and Stocks in Focus).Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week. Get it free >>

135,HSY,"PepsiCo, Inc. (PEP  -  Free Report) is set to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 26, before market open. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 0.77%. The company also surpassed expectations in each of the trailing four quarters, with the average being 4.05%.Let’s See How Things are Shaping Up for Q1Sluggish CSD (carbonated soft drinks) volumes are the pressing concerns for this beverage giant as well as other non-alcoholic beverage companies. PepsiCo’s CSD volumes declined 5% in 2017 in the North America Beverages business.Consumer taste is rapidly shifting from CSDs to non-carbonated beverages. Keeping this in mind, PepsiCo is gradually reshuffling its portfolio toward healthier alternatives. To this end, the company has stepped up its innovation efforts and investments toward e-commerce, R&D and social/digital marketing/design for enhancing its top line.PepsiCo has delivered organic revenue growth in the past four quarters, banking on significant innovation, revenue management strategies, along with better market execution.If we look back at PepsiCo’s Q4 performance, the company’s total organic revenue growth was modest at 2.3%, driven by 2% pricing on 2% volume growth in food/snacks, offset by a 2% volume decline in beverages. However, its total revenues remained unchanged from the year-ago level.Notably, results of North America Beverages (NAB) segment — comprising beverage businesses in the United States and Canada — remained soft in Q4. The company’s NAB segment was negatively impacted by higher input costs, operating cost inflation and restructuring charges that substantially offset productivity gains. Moreover, the 53rd reporting week in the prior year and hurricane-related costs also added to the woes. Organic sales and beverage volumes were down 3% and 2%, respectively, in the quarter.Segment DiscussionNorth America Beverages or NAB business (which includes beverage businesses in the United States and Canada) accounts for about 33% of PepsiCo’s total revenues. Revenues at the segment declined 6% in the fourth quarter, 3% in the third quarter and remained unchanged in the first two quarters of 2017. The trend is unlikely to reverse in the to-be-reported quarter as well. For the first quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for NAB segment revenues is pegged at $4.39 billion, implying a decline from $$5.9 billion in Q4 and $4.46 billion in the year-ago quarter.For Frito-Lay North America or FLNA business (accounting for 25% of revenues), the company had a good balance of volume growth, net price realization and operating margin expansion. However, the segment’s revenues decreased 1% last quarter but increased 2% in 2017. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment revenues is pegged at $3.64 billion, implying a decline from $4.83 billion in the prior quarter but an increase from $3.5 billion in the year-ago period.Quaker Foods North America segment revenues decreased 5% in the fourth quarter and 2% in 2017. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment revenues is pegged at $605 million versus $774 million in the fourth quarter and $598 million in the first quarter of 2017.Europe Sub-Saharan Africa segment revenues grew 11% in the fourth quarter and 8% in 2017. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment revenues is pegged at $1.6 billion, implying an increase from $1.4 billion in the prior-year period but a decrease from $3.7 billion last quarter.Latin America segment revenues grew 6% in the prior quarter as well as 2017. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment revenues is pegged at $1.1 billion compared with $1.1 billion in the first quarter of 2017 and $$2.4 billion in the fourth quarter.Asia, Middle East and North Africa segment revenues remained unchanged year over year in the fourth quarter but decreased 5% in 2017. The segment’s revenues are likely to improve to $1 billion in the first quarter of 2018 from $970 million registered in the year-ago period, per the consensus estimate. However, it is likely to decline from $1.9 billion in the prior quarter.Overall, for the first quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for PepsiCo’s total revenues stands at $12.4 billion, implying a 3% year-over-year increase.Other Factors to Influence PepsiCo’s First-Quarter Performance:Coming to the company’s margins, PepsiCo had earlier indicated that as commodity inflation is expected to continue in 2018, the company’s gross margin might face some pressure in the to-be-reported quarter.Notwithstanding the above-mentioned concerns, the company beat expectations in the last eight quarters. The company’s productivity programs will likely support its core operating margin expansion. PepsiCo’s productivity programs are on track to achieve annual $1 billion target.For the first quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings stands at 92 cents, reflecting a 2.1% year-over-year decrease.Quantitative Model PredictionHere is what our quantitative model predicts:PepsiCo does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — to increase the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: PepsiCo has an Earnings ESP of -0.97%.Zacks Rank: PepsiCo carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings surprise.Pepsico, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Pepsico, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Pepsico, Inc.

136,HSY,"The Fearless Girl facing the Manhattan financial district's famous Charging Bull near Wall Street will get a new permanent home by the end of this year in front of the New York Stock Exchange. Despite several criticism, the statue has become a tourist destination and a global symbol of female business prowess since its installation more than a year ago.About The Fearless GirlShe is a ponytailed, young, four-foot-tall bronze monument with fists on hips and chin held high as a symbol of empowerment. State Street Global Advisors at Bowling Green Park on Broadway Street originally installed the sculpture on the eve of International Women’s Day 2017. The Fearless Girl is a growing symbol for gender equality and the power of women in leadership. It spreads a message to encourage companies to recruit women to their board. The plaque at the statue’s feet reads “Know the power of women in leadership. SHE makes a difference.”The ‘Fearless Girl’ is part of a campaign by State Street to encourage companies to add more women to their boards and to advertise SPDR SSGA Gender Diversity Index ETF (SHE  -  Free Report), which comprises gender-diverse companies that have a relatively high percentage of women among their senior leadership.Inside SHEThis ETF offers exposure to U.S. companies that demonstrate greater gender diversity within senior leadership than other firms in their sector by tracking the SSGA Gender Diversity Index. Holding 168 stocks, it is moderately concentrated on the top firms as each account for less than 5.8% of assets. Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report), Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report) and Mastercard Inc. (MA  -  Free Report) are top three holdings. From a sector look, information technology takes the largest share at 22.2%, followed by healthcare (16.4%), consumer staples (13.1%) and consumer discretionary (12.0%). SHE has returned 10.2% over the past year versus the gain of 15.45% for the broad market fund (SPY  -  Free Report).Impact On Women-LeadershipOut of 700 companies in the United States, Britain and Australia that had no women serving on their boards, more than 150 companies have added a female director to their boards since the placement of the bronze girl statue, with another 34 pledging to do so. Currently, women make up 5% of CEOs in the Fortune 500 companies and 17% of the corporate board members among Fortune 500 companies.Today, a record number of women are in power this year. In the United States, 32 Fortune 500 CEOs are women, three women are in the Supreme Court, and three of the last eight U.S. Secretaries of State were women. Last year, 15 of 146 world leaders were women, eight of whom served as their country’s first female leaders. Some of the famous women leaders include Angela Merkel and Dilma Rousseff.In the corporate world, Indra Nooyi, CEO of PepsiCo (PEP  -  Free Report); Sheryl Sandberg, COO of Facebook (FB  -  Free Report); Mary Barra, CEO of General Motors (GM  -  Free Report); Angela Ahrendts, Senior Vice-President of Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report); Denise Morrison, CEO of Campbell Soup Company (CPB  -  Free Report); and Michele Buck, CEO of Hershey (HSY  -  Free Report) are leaders in their own right. Per several researches, companies led by women have a long history of outperformance.Bottom LinePlacing the Fearless Girl right next to the NYSE is the perfect metaphor to promote more companies to hire women to their boards, according to the State Street Global Advisors. With the move, the Fearless Girl will be more powerful standing alone outside NYSE than the her current home turf, which she shares with the Charging Bull. Hopefully, she will continue to stimulate the power of having women in leadership.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

137,HSY,"The Q2 earnings season has so far seen releases from 41.9% of the consumer staples companies in the S&P 500 cohort. According to the latest Earnings Preview, 53.8% of the companies in the Consumer Staples sector have surpassed earnings and 61.5% have beat revenue expectations. Total earnings for these consumer staples companies increased 2.9%, while revenues declined 2.6%.Some of the key players in the sector – General Mills Inc. (GIS  -  Free Report), The Hershey Company (HSY  -  Free Report) – have already released their quarterly numbers. Hershey beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings and revenues in second-quarter 2017 by 19.8% and 0.7%, respectively. General Mills’ cost-saving initiatives have helped it come up with better-than-expected fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results along with solid adjusted operating profit margin expansion. Total revenue however declined 3% year over year owing to lower organic sales.The Food industry, within the Consumer Staples sector, has been performing dismally for quite some time now. Major U.S. food companies are striving to retain market share as easy-to-prepare and ready-to-eat convenience food items are gradually losing ground. A shift in consumer preference toward healthier options and a higher level of price consciousness are hurting the industry, making it hard for legacy brands to boost sales. Nonetheless, effective promotional strategies, introduction of nutritious products, cost-saving and restructuring initiatives might prove beneficial for the food industry at large.Given this backdrop, let’s try to determine how these players – Kellogg Company (K  -  Free Report). The Kraft Heinz Company (KHC  -  Free Report) and Treehouse Foods, Inc. (THS  -  Free Report) – are placed ahead of their second-quarter earnings releases on Aug 3.Kellogg Company, the world's leading producer of cereal and convenience foods, posted a positive earnings surprise of 4.9% in the last quarter. The company surpassed estimates in all of the past four quarters at an average of 6.16%.Currently, the company has an Earnings ESP of +2.17% as the Most Accurate estimate stands at 94 cents while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 92 cents. Also, the stock carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Our proven model shows that Kellogg is likely to beat earnings this quarter.

138,HSY,"General Mills Inc. (GIS  -  Free Report) has been benefiting from continued strength in its snacks and frozen products, higher net price realizations, and improved mix. However, inflation in commodity prices, and higher freight and logistics costs continue to hurt margins.Recently, the food giant reported third quarter of fiscal 2018 results, wherein the company’s earnings met the Zacks Consensus Estimate but revenues lagged the same. Meanwhile, the company’s shares have plunged 26.5% in the last three months, comparing unfavorably with the industry’s 12.6% decline.Earnings estimates for the current quarter and year have moved south by 4.7% and 1.3%, respectively, in the last seven days. The company’s weak sales growth trajectory and margin woes may impact the stock’s performance in the upcoming quarters. A Look at the Company’s Sales Performance and OutlookGeneral Mills, like many other U.S. food producers, has been struggling due to the shift in consumer preferences toward natural and organic food. Management is trying to turn around the U.S. Retail business through consumer-focused innovation and marketing.After sales declined 3.5% in the fiscal first quarter, General Mills’ sales showed marked improvement in the fiscal second quarter. Total revenues of $4.2 billion grew 2.1% year over year, owing to higher sales across the board.General Mills also continued its sales growth momentum in fiscal third quarter. The company’s sales of $3.9 billion improved 2.3% from the prior-year quarter owing to higher sales across the board. Higher net price realizations and improved mix helped General Mills report improved sales performance. Favorable currency translation rates also supported its top line.The company’s legacy North America Retail segment’s revenues grew 1% to $2.52 billion due to 6% growth in the Canada operating unit, 3% in U.S. Snacks, and 2% in U.S. Meals & Baking business units. Continued strength in its snacks and frozen products has helped the company post better numbers. Moreover, the Soup and Baking segments also positively impacted the company’s sales.The company’s focus on consumer-focused innovation seems to be bearing fruits. New products like Chocolate Peanut Butter Cheerios, Oui by Yoplait, and Yoplait Mix-Ins have been generating solid demand. Nature Valley snack bars have also witnessed higher demand.That said, yogurt and cereals continue to remain a drag on its top line. Net sales were down 8% in the U.S. Yogurt and 1% in U.S. Cereal in the recently reported quarter. In the first nine months of fiscal 2018, U.S. Cereal net sales were down 1% and sales in the U.S. Cereal unit were down 14% from the year-ago level. While management is taking initiatives to reinvigorate this priority business through innovation and increased promotional support for new products, we are yet to see significant growth.For fiscal 2018, General Mills reiterated its sales guidance and expects its organic sales to remain flat. The company’s sales are expected to benefit from its new products as well as from its acquisition of Blue Buffalo Pet Products. However, sales weakness in cereals and yogurt remain a headwind.Higher Costs to Compress MarginsGeneral Mills continues to disappoint on the margins front. Gross margin and operating margin contracted 250 basis points (bps) and 120 bps, respectively, in the fiscal third quarter. The downside was due to higher input, freight and manufacturing costs.A tepid sales environment, higher spending to support top-line growth and price competition among retailers are expected to hurt margins of the packaged food manufacturers like General Mills, Kellogg (K  -  Free Report), Kraft Heinz (KHC  -  Free Report), Hershey (HSY  -  Free Report), and others.General Mills expects inflation in commodity, transportation and other operational costs to adversely impact its fiscal 2018 margins. Hence, the company cut its operating profit and earnings guidance for the fiscal year. General Mills expects its operating profit to register a decline of 5-6% in fiscal 2018. Earlier, it had expected its operating profit to either decline 1% or remain flat.Also, the company, with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), has slashed its expectation for adjusted earnings per share (constant currency) growth from flat to up 1% versus prior expectation of 1-2% growth.

139,HSY,"The Hershey Company (HSY  -  Free Report) regularly innovates to cater to changing consumer behavior. Products like Cookie Layer Crunch, Popped Snack Mix and Chocolate Dipped Pretzels have significantly contributed to the company’s growth in 2017.Hershey has already launched Hershey's Gold in an instant consumable pack type. The company plans to launch take-home packages in the second quarter of 2018, which is likely to drive sales in the second half of the year. The same holds true for Reese's Outrageous. The company’s core chocolate brands — Reese's, Hershey's, Kit Kat and Kisses — continue to drive growth. In 2017, the combined retail takeaway on these power brands increased about 5%. The momentum is expected to continue in 2018. Moreover, the company plans to improve the performance of select candy brands, which are likely to be positive contributors to marketplace performance in 2018.The acquisition of Amplify broadens participation in salty snacks, one of the fastest growing sub segments. The transaction is slated to close in the first quarter of 2018 and is expected to be accretive to Hershey's earnings in the first year following the closure. Overall for 2018, the company expects sales to increase 5-7%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $7.94 billion, reflecting an improvement of 5.7% year over year.Apart from product innovation, let us delve into some of the key factors which are likely to affect the company’s performance in 2018.Marketing Initiatives to Increase VisibilityConsidering the sluggish sales performance, introducing innovative products is not enough. Packaging and marketing initiatives are also required to ensure strong customer outreach. The company is transitioning from lay-down bags to stand-up pouches on core chocolate candy products. These ensure that products get on the shelf quicker with less in-store labor and improve shopping experience.While these packaging initiatives will adversely impact gross margin in 2018, the company believes that this is the right long-term investments which will improve shelf presence and visibility in 2018. Hershey has also made solid progress in key capabilities, such as multiyear ERP program and e-commerce.Cost-Saving Initiative to Offset ExpensesHigher freight and logistics cost hurt margins and are expected to be a headwind in 2018. Also, increased packaging costs and unfavorable mix are dampeners. Adjusted gross margin in 2018 is expected to be flat year over year. Nevertheless, Hershey’s productivity and cost-saving initiatives should offset higher costs. Savings from the Margin for Growth program are estimated in the range of $55-$65 million in 2018.China Business to Mar Sales VolumeThe implementation of Margin for Growth program in China is driving majority of the improvement. However, China SKU analysis and optimization efforts dented gross sales volume in 2017 and will continue to do so this year.Meanwhile, Hershey expects operating income to increase in North America and International as well as Other segments in 2018. Considering the planned capability investments — such as digital commerce — North America will not improve as much on a percentage basis as the International and Other segment.Bottom LineHershey’s strong U.S. marketplace presence and solid financial position provide the flexibility to invest in confectionery and other salty snacks as well as in the capabilities that lend the company a competitive edge over peers like The J. M. Smucker Company (SJM  -  Free Report), Hostess Brands, Inc. (TWNK  -  Free Report) and The Simply Good Foods Company (SMPL  -  Free Report).Product innovation, acquisition of Amplify and savings from Margin for Growth program are expected to boost earnings in 2018 despite higher expenses. The company expects adjusted earnings per share in the range of $5.33-$5.43, reflecting a 12-14% increase from last year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $5.36, showing an improvement of 12.6% year over year.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

144,HSY,"The food industry has been dealing with a slew of issues of late. Major U.S. food companies are striving to retain market share as easy-to-prepare and ready-to-eat food items are losing ground. A shift in consumer preference toward healthier options and a higher level of price consciousness are hurting the industry, making it hard for legacy brands to boost sales.In order to combat weak sales, food majors are aggressively trying to improve their products through innovation as well as by pursuing strategic acquisitions and divestitures. They are channeling funds toward product and packaging innovation as well as reformulating a number of existing products to meet the rapidly changing consumer view on health and wellness. Apart from this, companies have adopted multi-year restructuring initiatives with focus on improving operational efficiency to generate cost savings.Therefore, though the companies’ sales have been relatively soft, cost savings have led to better margins. Again, savings are being re-invested in the business for innovation, brand building and marketing to stimulate top-line growth.Among the food companies that have already reported their numbers, McCormick & Company (MKC  -  Free Report) posted solid fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results, with earnings and revenues outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate and improving year over year. Last month, General Mills (GIS  -  Free Report) delivered in-line earnings in second-quarter fiscal 2018, after a negative earnings surprise of 7.79% in first-quarter fiscal 2018.Q4 ExpectationsAs we take a closer look at the Q4 earnings season, we see a steady improvement over the past few quarters. According to the latest Earnings Preview, of the 133 S&P 500 members that have reported Q4 results as of Jan 26, 81.2% have surpassed EPS estimates and 78.9% have come up with top-line beats. The proportion of companies beating both EPS and revenue estimates is 65.4%.Total Q4 earnings are expected to be up 11.6% from the same period last year on 7.5% higher revenues compared with 6.7% earnings growth in the third quarter of 2017 on 5.9% rise in revenues.For Q4, total earnings for the companies in the Consumers Staples sector (which includes food stocks) are projected to grow 6% year over year, more than 3.9% in the previous quarter. Revenues are expected to increase 2.5% compared with 1.9% in the third quarter. Let’s see what awaits the following food stocks that are queued up for earnings releases on Feb 1.Our research shows that when a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) stock has a positive Earnings ESP, the chance of beating earnings estimates is high.The Hershey Company (HSY  -  Free Report) is slated to report fourth-quarter 2017 results, before the opening bell.We expect the top line to remain subdued in the to-be-reported quarter, as has been the case for quite some time now owing to changes in consumer preference in North America and soft international sales.In the fourth quarter, the company had plans of introducing retail-ready packaging at select outlets. Also, Hershey is transitioning the packaging of its core chocolate products. Though these initiatives will improve shelf presence and visibility over the long haul, it is expected to affect fourth-quarter gross margin. Moreover, higher advertising expenses in China and the United States related to product innovation are expected to impact results in the to-be-reported quarter.Overall, for the fourth quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $1.06, reflecting a 9.4% year-over-year decline. The consensus estimate for revenues is pegged at $1.98 billion, implying a 0.3% increase.Last quarter, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.9%. The company beat the consensus mark in all of the last four quarters, resulting in an average earnings beat of 9%.

145,HSY,"The Hershey Company (HSY  -  Free Report) is slated to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 1, before the opening bell.We expect the top line to remain subdued in the to-be-reported quarter, as has been the case for quite some time now owing to changes in consumer preference in North America and soft international sales.Food companies are suffering as the North American food industry is experiencing changes in consumer preference (shift toward products with less artificial sweeteners, sodium and saturated fat), consumer dynamics (such as increased demand for portable and on-the-go products) and increased demand for lower-priced products. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for North America segment revenues, comprising 89% of total revenues, is pegged at $1.67 billion, reflecting a decline of 1% year over year in the fourth quarter.To add to the woes, Hershey has been witnessing weakness in international markets since 2015. International sales declined 14% (including acquisitions/divestures and currency headwinds) in 2015 and 0.5% in 2016, primarily due to weakness in China. Again, in the first nine months of 2017, sales increased a meager 0.3% year over year. The trend is expected to continue in the fourth quarter as well. International and Other segment is likely to witness 1.4% increase in sales, per the consensus estimate.Overall, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter revenues stands at $1.98 billion, implying 0.3% year-over-year growth.Let as delve deeper into other factors that are likely to impact Hershey’s Q4 performance:To combat weak sales, Hershey regularly innovates core brands to meet consumer demand and needs that are not addressed by its current portfolio. In the fourth quarter, the company launched Hershey's Gold and Cookie Layer Crunch Triple Chocolate. However, sales of these products are not expected to be as great as the Cookie Layer Crunch sale in the prior-year quarter.In the fourth quarter, the company had plans of introducing retail-ready packaging at select outlets. This initiative enables products to get on the shelf quicker, with less in-store labor and also improves the shopping experience in the aisle. Also, Hershey is transitioning the packaging of its core chocolate products. Though these initiatives will improve shelf presence and visibility over the long haul, it is expected to affect fourth-quarter gross margin.Moreover, higher advertising expenses in China and the United States related to product innovation are expected to impact results in the to-be-reported quarter. Again, supply chain costs that dented third-quarter operating profits are expected to remain an overhang in the fourth quarter as well.Overall, Hershey’s bottom line is likely to decline 9.4% to $1.06 per share in the fourth quarter of 2017. Last quarter, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.9%. The company surpassed the consensus mark in all of the last four quarters, resulting in an average earnings beat of 9%.On the bright side, we are encouraged by Hershey’s productivity improvement and cost-saving initiatives. The company expects $25 million in savings from the Margin for Growth program. As part of this multi-year program, it will reduce its global workforce outside the United States by 15%. This program is intended to improve overall operating margin through supply chain optimization, a streamlined operating model and reduced administrative expenses.International and Other segment’s operating income increased substantially in the third quarter on the implementation of the Margin for Growth program and the favorable timing of select investments and expenses. The trend is expected to reflect in the fourth-quarter results as well.Quantitative Model PredictionHere is what our quantitative model predicts:Hershey has the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — which is required for an earnings beat.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Hershey is +0.87%.

146,HSY,"The U.S. equity markets welcomed 2018 on a strong note as the Dow broke the historic milestone of 25,000 for the first time, while other leading benchmark indices scaled record highs on solid economic data across the globe. The stock market euphoria is likely to extend further on the corporate tax overhaul and relatively healthy job data.   As investors employ a wait-and-see approach in a classic example of “backing and filling” in the market, they could benefit from ‘cash cow’ stocks that garner higher returns.However, singling out cash-rich stocks alone does not make for a solid investment proposition unless they are backed by attractive efficiency ratios like return on equity (ROE). A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting its cash at a high rate of return.Why ROE?ROE = Net Income/Shareholders’ EquityROE helps investors distinguish profit-generating companies from profit burners and is useful in determining the financial health of a company. In other words, this financial metric enables investors to identify stocks that diligently deploy cash for higher returns.Moreover, ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry — the higher, the better. It measures how well a company is multiplying its profits without investing new equity capital and portrays management’s efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk-adjusted returns.Parameters Used for ScreeningIn order to shortlist stocks that are cash rich with high ROE, we have added Cash Flow greater than $1 billion and ROE greater than X-Industry as our primary screening parameters. In addition, we have taken a few other criteria into consideration to arrive at a winning strategy.Price/Cash Flow less than X-Industry: This metric measures how much investors pay for one dollar of free cash flow. A lower ratio indicates that investors need to pay less for a better cash flow generating stock.Return on Assets (ROA) greater than X-Industry: This metric determines how much profit a company earns for every dollar of asset, which includes cash, accounts receivable, property, equipment, inventory and furniture. The higher the ROA, the better it is for the company.5-Year EPS Historical Growth greater than X-Industry: This criterion indicates that continued earnings momentum has translated into solid cash strength.   Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Here are five of the 15 stocks that qualified the screen:Waste Management, Inc. (WM  -  Free Report): Headquartered in Houston, TX, Waste Management is the largest provider of comprehensive waste management services in North America. The company provides collection, transfer, recycling and resource recovery, as well as disposal services to nearly 20 million residential, commercial, industrial and municipal customers.

147,HSY,"The Hershey Company’s (HSY  -  Free Report) cost-cutting initiatives and productivity investments serve as effective hedges to a weak top-line performance. The company has been witnessing sluggish sales growth owing to changing consumer shopping habits, intense competition from the broader snacking environment in the United States and soft international sales. In 2016, sales increased a meager 0.7%, while the first nine months of 2017 saw a rise of only 1.9%.Therefore the company resorts to various cost-saving initiatives to drive growth. Under its continuous improvement and productivity program, management has optimized its North American manufacturing footprint, added manufacturing capabilities in international markets, increased supply chain productivity and improved the sales mix significantly.The company’s new cost-saving program, Margin for Growth, bodes well. As part of the multi-year program, Hershey plans to reduce its global workforce outside the United States by 15%. It will also improve the overall operating margin through supply chain optimization, a streamlined operating model and reduced administrative expenses, with savings likely to be registered in 2018 and 2019.For 2017, Hershey’s expects $25 million in savings from the Margin for Growth program. Also, this program will likely generate cash savings at an annual run-rate of $150 million to $175 million and enable Hershey to achieve adjusted operating profit margin target of about 22-23% by the end of 2019.Productivity improvement and cost-saving initiatives have helped the stock gain 11.2% so far this year compared with the industry’s decline of 20%.Apart from cost-saving initiatives, Hershey is accelerating its business in key global markets to bolster its international presence. The company is making measured investments in core markets of Mexico, Brazil and India, where it is witnessing solid marketplace gains. Combined constant currency net sales growth in these markets was 8% in the last reported quarter.Among the emerging countries, the company’s special focus is on China. It started implementing the Margin for Growth program in the second quarter of 2017 to optimize manufacturing operations in order to support the China business. Going forward, the company has devised a measured and disciplined strategy in China that is focused on the brand's messaging, continued e-commerce penetration and smaller store format expansion.Moreover, Hershey regularly innovates its core brands to meet consumer demand and needs that are not addressed by its current portfolio. An important strategy of the company is to create a unique and holistic portfolio for every season, which can meet consumers’ seasonal shopping needs. Hershey’s core chocolate brands, Reese's, Hershey's, Kit Kat and Kisses, continue to drive growth. Also, Hershey's Cookie Layer Crunch’s have been performing well. The company expects innovative products to help it achieve its long-term net sales growth target of 2% to 4%.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderHershey carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the Zacks Consumer Staples sector are Flowers Foods, Inc. (FLO  -  Free Report), Nomad Foods Limited (NOMD  -  Free Report) and Lamb Weston Holdings Inc. (LW  -  Free Report), each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

148,HSY,"Palantir Technologies is a privately-held software and services company that has taken Silicon Valley by storm since its launch back in 2004. It was founded by Peter Thiel, Nathan Gettings, Joe Lonsdale, Stephen Cohen, and Alex Karp (now CEO) with the idea of “creating the world’s best user experience for working with data, one that empowers people to ask and answer complex questions without requiring them to master querying languages, statistical modeling, or the command line.”While its name is derived from the palantÍr, a “seeing stone” in J.R.R. Tolkein’s fantasy series Lord of the Rings—even its motto is “Save the Shire,” in reference to the home of the hobbits of Middle Earth—Palantir actually emerged from mobile payments giant PayPal’s (PYPL  -  Free Report) anti-fraud efforts (its co-founder Thiel also co-founded PayPal).It’s also often considered to be one of the most secretive tech unicorns out there today. And by secretive, I mean a couple of things. For one, many people just haven’t heard of the company, especially outside of the tech and investing worlds; its Big Data focus is not nearly as flashy and exciting as ride-hailing or home-sharing. For another, Palantir and its technology is still best known for antiterrorism and spycraft, two avenues that must be secretive in order to thrive. It’s “Minority Report come true,” writes The Guardian.What They DoIf you have heard of Palantir, then you know that the company’s technology has been used in several notable cases, including the discovery of the infamous Chinese espionage networks, GhostNet and the Shadow Network. There’s also their rumored-but-never-confirmed efforts to help take down Osama Bin Laden.Even though its role in Bin Laden’s takedown will likely never be established as fact, what can be recognized, however, is Palantir’s extensive relationship with the U.S. government. Just as recently as six years ago, Palantir sold exclusively to the government sector.  The FBI, CIA, IRS, CDC, Department of Homeland Security, Department of Defense, and several branches of the armed forces have all been customers, and up to 50% of the company’s business is tied to the public sector. Even In-Q-Tel, the CIA’s venture arm, was an early investor.For instance, The Guardian goes on to note that the Pentagon “used Palantir software [in Iraq] to track patterns in roadside bomb deployment and worked out garage-door openers were being used as remote detonators by predicting it.”Palantir also has commercial customers that rely on them to detect fraud, study consumer behavior, and search for a competitive edge against rivals; these clients include JPMorgan Chase (JPM  -  Free Report), Hershey (HSY  -  Free Report), and Bridgewater Associates, a global investment management firm, among others. Overall, private customers make up about 75% of Palantir’s revenue, notes Fortune.Big Data PioneerAs a whole, Palantir prides itself on being one of the world’s Big Data solutions experts. It’s a term that refers to a collection of structured and multi-structured data from traditional and digital sources inside and outside a company, representing a source for ongoing discovery and analysis. Examples of structured data include tweets (TWTR  -  Free Report) and other social media posts, while multi-structured data is something that can be derived from interactions between people and machines.To help tackle Big Data, Palantir created two software suites for which it’s best known for. Formerly known as Palantir Finance, Palantir Metropolis is software for data integration, information management, and quantitative analytics. The software connects to commercial, proprietary, and public data sets and discovery trends, relationships and anomalies, including predictive analytics. And yes, this software suite is named after the home city of Superman.For users like hedge funds, banks, and financial services firms, Metropolis provides a number of integrated applications in order to build up interactive models using all the data that is available in their system. This includes Custom Metric, Dashboard, Date Set, Explorer, Regression, and Spreadsheet applications.The other is Palantir Gotham, formerly known as Palantir Government. This software integrates structured and unstructured data, provides search and discovery capabilities, knowledge management, and secure collaboration. Like Metropolis, Gotham is named after the home city of fellow superhero Batman.Gotham provides a suite of tools that are optimized for semantic, temporal, geospatial, and full-text analysis. Users can seamlessly drag and drop data objects from one application to the next, and applications include Graphs, Maps, Object Explorer, Browser, and Mobile.IPO BuzzWith a valuation at $20 billion, Palantir is one of the world’s most valuable venture-backed tech startups, but the company has yet to lay out any specific plans for an initial public offering. However, that hasn’t stopped IPO buzz from building, and investors have been excited for a while now about the potential for a Palantir market debut.The hype grew even more once President Trump took office, as co-founder Thiel is one of his closest tech advisors and CEO Karp joined with some of the industry’s biggest names—including executives from Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report), and Facebook (FB  -  Free Report), just to name a few—during the president’s transition period.Despite its impressive valuation and presidential connections, Palantir is still not profitable, though the company expects to reach profitability in 2017. Palantir doesn’t report current revenue, but according to Fortune, it brought in over $1 billion in 2014, and that commercial bookings in 2015 almost doubled year-over-year.But with buzz certainly comes controversy. In September 2016, Palantir was sued by the U.S. Department of Labor for discriminating against Asian applicants by routinely eliminating them in the screening process; Palantir recently settled, and will need to pay nearly $1.7 million in ""back pay and other monetary relief.”For now, talks of a Palantir IPO remain a combination of speculation and anticipation. Last October, Karp told The Wall Street Journal that the company was “positioned so [it] could go public,” a positive sign that Palantir could hit the market in the near future. And with its Big Data-focused business—something that will only become more prevalent with the rise of artificial intelligence—unique user base, and fundamentally secretive operations, Palantir’s potential IPO could be one for the books.An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that Garry Tan was a co-founder of Palantir; he came on board as employee number 10. This version has been corrected.<!--{cke_protected}{C}%3C!%2D%2Dtd%20%7Bborder%3A%201px%20solid%20%23ccc%3B%7Dbr%20%7Bmso-data-placement%3Asame-cell%3B%7D%2D%2D%3E-->Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.
