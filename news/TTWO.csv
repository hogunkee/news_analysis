Major publishers Activision Blizzard (ATVI), Electronic Arts (EA) and Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO) are looking healthy heading into the back half of 2018, Wall Street analysts say.Benchmark analyst Mike Hickey raised his targets on Activision, EA and Take-Two following meetings at the three-day conference, which ended Thursday. He rates all three stocks as buy.He upped his target on Activision to 93 from 80, on EA to 164 from 141, and on Take-Two to 156 from 135.Activision rose 0.6% to 77.87 on the stock market today.

Privacy Policy & Terms of UseActivision's upcoming shooter game ""Call of Duty: Black Ops 4"" is likely to continue the momentum of last year's successful ""Call of Duty: WWII"" game, Hickey said.One knock on ""Black Ops 4"" is that it doesn't have a single-player campaign. The game has bet the farm on multiplayer online play. Activision also has added a battle-royale mode called ""Blackout,"" which should add to player excitement, Hickey said. ""Black Ops 4"" comes out on Oct. 12.However, gamers are complaining on social media about Activision charging for additional maps as part of a downloadable content pass. That could end up splitting the community of players, GameRevolution reported.Meanwhile, EA's game slate looks solid, including ""Battlefield 5,"" due out Oct. 19; ""Anthem,"" out Feb. 22; plus its annual FIFA, Madden NFL and NBA Live games, Hickey said.Take-Two's focus is on the release of its highly anticipated Western game ""Red Dead Redemption 2,"" due out Oct. 26, as well as ""NBA 2K19,"" out Sept. 7.KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst Evan Wingren upped his price targets on Activision and EA after the E3 show.He raised his target on Activision to 90 from 83 and on EA to 168 from 152.

But we're not going to redefine our product line through the lens of someone else's success.""Take-Two hopes to imitate its own success in""GTA Online"" by creating an online subscription service for ""Red Dead"" players.""There will be an online offering for 'Red Dead,'"" he said. ""(Game studio) Rockstar hasn't given out a lot of detail yet on what that will look like, but I'm quite certain it will stand alone and it will look like nothing you've seen before.""A big topic at E3 this year has been the growth of esports and professional video gaming. Take-Two has partnered with the National Basketball Association for the NBA 2K League.Take-Two isn't planning any more esports offerings, Zelnick said.""We're focused on NBA 2K,"" he said. ""Right now, the esports business is largely driven by 'League of Legends' in terms of revenue and the business.

Critics wonder whether fans will want to follow a virtual sport when a real-world version of the game already exists.Brendan Donohue, NBA 2K League managing director, said the league has a number of business advantages compared with other esports for games like ""League of Legends"" from Tencent (TCEHY)-owned Riot Games or ""Overwatch"" from Activision Blizzard (ATVI).Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

20,TTWO,"Facebook (FB), the esports industry and media companies like Disney (DIS) could be in for a revenue boom due to the Supreme Court's decision to legalize sports betting.XBarclay's analyst Ross Sandler believes Monday's decision has massive implications for both the social media giant and the rapidly growing pastime of competitive video game playing. Tencent (TCEHY), Activision Blizzard (ATVI) and Take-Two (TTWO) are all seen as potential winners.""(The) ruling should pave the way for more widespread access to betting on professional esports, which is a clear positive for traditional sports betting sites, many of which have recently begun to offer esports betting,"" Sandler said in a research note.""This news is also a net positive for video game publishers Tencent (Riot Games) and Activision (Blizzard), which operate several of the most-watched esports globally, as well as Take-Two, which recently launched an esport in partnership with the NBA.""While video game companies are perhaps not the most obvious beneficiaries from the ruling, the analyst expects them to get material gains in a variety of ways.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

""This trial didn't really get very far, but structurally everything is in place for users and developers to leverage Facebook as a gaming and sharing channel when online betting goes live.""The figures that could be funneled into online advertising are substantial, with Barclay's estimating the opportunity to be worth around $3 billion. However, it stressed there is precedent for the sums being even higher.""However, if the same situation that happened in 2015 plays out whereby DraftKings and FanDuel spent 180% of revenue on customer acquisition (the scorched-earth land-grab phase), this figure could easily top $10 (billion) in digital ad (spending),"" Sandler said.Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley analyst Thomas Allen believes media companies could also be in line to benefit from legal sports gambling, ""including sports team and rights owners,"" such as Liberty Media (BATRA) and Madison Square Garden (MSG).However, there will also be wider benefits, with the likes of ESPN parent Disney and MSG Networks, which will cash in ""from increased advertising on live sports content.""""Online gaming companies typically spend 20%-30% of sales on marketing in order to consolidate share, and so TV networks and sports leagues could be beneficiaries,"" Allen said in a research note.Sports betting is not out of the woods yet, as Congress could step in, according to Cowen analysts.But the firm pointed out that opponents to gambling lack the votes needed to enact a ban.

""Our stellar results were highlighted by record recurrent consumer spending on both 'Grand Theft Auto Online' and 'NBA 2K18,' robust ongoing sales of 'Grand Theft Auto 5,' and the successful launch of 'WWE 2K18.'""Take-Two raised its guidance for fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings per share to $3.23 at the midpoint, up from prior guidance of $2.90 and Wall Street's target of $3.07.

22,TTWO,"First things first: Strauss Zelnick is neither a gamer nor a designer of the imaginative video games that put the company he leads, Take-Two Interactive (TTWO), on the forefront of digital entertainment.He insists as much. What's more, he is neither an entertainer nor a creative type of any kind.""I know what I'm not good at,"" he said in a recent interview from the New York offices of the video game publisher he has guided for more than a decade. ""I always wanted to be an entertainer, to be creative, but I just didn't have the requisite talent on that side.""What he does have is an abundance of management skill, a knack for identifying talent and a passion for developing it.With both a law degree and an M.B.A. from Harvard University, Zelnick, 60, built an executive career that spans decades and various corners of the entertainment industry — from a four-year run as president of motion-picture power 20th Century Fox in the 1980s, to heading music giant BMG Entertainment when the recording industry still thrived in the 1990s, to his current role leading Take-Two.Zelnick has been executive chairman of Take-Two since 2007 and CEO since 2011. The company publishes the wildly popular Grand Theft Auto and NBA2K series of video games.All of his business leadership endeavors have proved successful. Analysts say his latest stands out as particularly impressive.Back in 2007, when Zelnick agreed to help turn around Take-Two, the company was mired in woe. It was coming off an annual loss that approached $200 million, its former chief executive had pleaded guilty to falsifying records, regulators swirled with demands, and its stock was battered.The company had its Grand Theft Auto franchise of games but not much else. Zelnick said he focused first on the things he had to do: Rein in costs, shore up controls, rebuild Take-Two's reputation and push the company out of the shadow of controversy.Zelnick said his previous experience taught him an important lesson: Do not put off tough decisions, and act swiftly when changes are necessary or problems need fixing.Along the road to redemption for Take-Two, Zelnick focused intently on recruiting talent — and in some cases parting with underperforming employees — both on the creative and business sides. He created a vision and worked to build a team that bought into it.He believed that video game technology at the time was powerful. It enabled designers to incorporate into games not just impressive graphics but also rich characters and evolving stories that users found engrossing, even gratifying.And Zelnick believed that, as long as Take-Two's games evolved with fast-developing technology and expanded in number to meet the interests of a wider audience, the company would not only recover but also flourish. He was right.It took time and an infusion of prominent video game developers. Zelnick ensured that the creative forces of the company had the resources and runway to develop the best games possible. And when a new offering was ready to go public, he made sure the company was ready to market it aggressively and shrewdly.Pressed to set aside what appears an instinctive modesty, Zelnick acknowledges that he is uniquely gifted at identifying talented people and unwaveringly committed to making sure they get the backing needed to excel.""I'm very devoted to the success of the enterprise,"" he said.Accessibility and responsiveness to staffers' needs and questions, Zelnick added, go a long way toward successful retention. ""We have very low turnover,"" he said. ""I don't want it to be hard for anyone to get to me. It needs to be easy. That makes a big difference.""Today, Take-Two has annual revenue of about $2 billion, nearly three times the level it was at when Zelnick took over. It has no debt and is flush with cash.The company has nurtured and made increasingly sophisticated its GTA series, and it continues to generate robust sales. ""Grand Theft Auto 5,"" released in 2013, had sold more than 90 million copies by early 2018. It is the best-selling console video game ever made.""It was — and remains — the standard-bearer for the industry as far as quality, entertainment and fun,"" Zelnick said of GTA.But Take-Two also has broadened its offering considerably, venturing successfully into sports with the NBA2K (basketball) and WWE2K (wrestling) series, and into a range of other popular adventure offerings such as XCOM and ""Sid Meier's Civilization,"" among others.The company's stock has climbed more than sevenfold over the past five years. Over the 12 months ended Feb. 28, shares of Take-Two soared more than 80%. Its market capitalization tops $11 billion.For its fiscal 2018 third quarter ended Dec. 31, 2017, Take-Two posted net income of $25.1 million, or 21 cents per diluted share, on net revenue of $480.8 million.Its outlook is bright. Take-Two and larger rivals Activision Blizzard (ATVI) and Electronic Arts (EA) are benefiting from a steady shift from packaged games to digital delivery, which includes full-game downloads and add-on content and services. Take-Two said its digitally delivered net revenue in the December quarter increased 8% from a year earlier to $258.4 million. It made up 54% of total net revenue.Piper Jaffray analysts predicted in a report that, by 2023, 100% of console video games will be sold as digital downloads.Digital delivery enables video game publishers to pass over retailers, sell directly to consumers and bolster profit margins in the process. The trend bodes well for the likes of Take-Two and helps explain why the company is upbeat on both revenue and earnings.It projected net revenue in a range of $460 million to $510 million for its fiscal 2018 fourth quarter. Net income is forecast to come in between $87 million to $99 million.The company recently raised full-year fiscal 2018 guidance, projecting adjusted earnings per share of $3.23 at the midpoint, up from $2.90 previously. Its fiscal 2018 revenue guidance of $2.02 billion was up from $1.98 billion.For its fiscal 2019, it looks for revenue to top $2.5 billion.""They have a lot of positives in their corner,"" analyst Neil Macker of Morningstar said in an interview.He said the fall 2018 release of Red Dead Redemption 2 — think GTA in the 1800s Wild West — should prove an important indicator of how strong the tailwinds are. If Red Dead can enter the realm of GTA5's online sales performance, Take-Two's favorable outlooks are likely to prove prescient, Macker said.While some observers wish Zelnick would pick up the pace with launching new products, he prefers to give projects the time and attention they require.While analysts such as Macker applaud the breadth of Take-Two's catalog today compared with a decade ago, some also wish Zelnick and company would expand deeper into potential growth areas such as sports and launch new versions of its existing games at a faster pace in order to gain ground on the notably larger Activision and Electronic Arts.""Management gets high marks,"" Macker said. ""They have a much more robust profile of franchises. But there is still room for more.""Zelnick understands. Investors do not like waiting long stretches for new catalysts. Development costs per new game tend to run high.But Zelnick said Take-Two's success ultimately is premised on the splendor of its games — not just the visuals, but also the nuances of the stories and uncommon challenges within the games. Game developers cannot be rushed. Taking time to get it right may leave gamers waiting longer than they like, but when they are truly dazzled with the product once it does come out, they tend to form stronger attachments to it and pass along positive reviews that help fuel long-term sales.Take-Two's average Metacritic ratings — an aggregation of game reviews — are consistently on the high end for the industry. The sales follow. And that validates one of the three pillars of leadership that Zelnick adheres to: Never compromise integrity. The others: Listen emphatically, and show up early and work hard.The last one comes naturally for Zelnick. From his college days, through the course of his career, and in his personal time — he is famously devoted to physical fitness, working out daily with people half his age — Zelnick digs in full-bore. But he views it more as devoting himself to cherished pursuits than hard work.""I'm not in the coal mines. I'm blessed,"" he said. ""This is very cool place to work.""Executive posts span music, movie and video game giants.Overcame: Steep losses to resurrect Take-Two into a video game power.Lesson: Show up early and work hard. Listen emphatically. Never compromise integrity.""I know what I'm not good at."" Realize your strengths and capitalize on them.

Meanwhile, Tesla (TSLA), Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO) and Yelp (YELP), fell in overnight trading on earnings, though Tesla's loss was relatively modest. Tesla, Take-Two Interactive and Yelp had closed near buy points.X In Wednesday's stock market trading, the S&P 500 index and Dow Jones industrial average were turned back from trying to retake their 50-day moving average lines as Treasury yields resumed their rise.

62,TTWO,"Snapchat parent Snap (SNAP) crashed on revenue that was far below views, but then pared losses on news that Chinese internet giant Tencent (TCEHY) has taken a big stake. Meanwhile, Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO), which has best-possible 99 Composite Rating, soared on strong sales and guidance.XS&P 500 index futures fell 0.1% vs. fair value. Nasdaq 100 and Dow futures lost a fraction.Snap revenue was $207.9 million, up 62% vs. a year earlier but decelerating once again and badly missing the consensus of $236 million.

Daily active users rose to 178 million, up 17% vs. a year earlier but below estimates for 181.8 million.Snap CEO Evan Spiegel even admitted that Snapchat is sometimes ""difficult to understand or hard to use.""Shares fell 17% to 12.53 late Tuesday. But shares bounced back before the open in the stock market today on news that Tencent has bought a 12% stake. Snap briefly turned slightly positive, but had faded to trade down about 8% at 13.93.Snap's performance from its IPO to today offers three key lessons for investors.Wait for a proper buy point. Don't try to guess the bottom. And be wary of investing in an upstart rival trying to mess with the established FANG internet giants, in this case Facebook (FB).IBD'S TAKE: Take-Two has a best-possible 99 Composite Rating, which combines several IBD ratings into one overall score. All-time stock winners often have Composite Ratings of 95 or above near the start of their big runs. To learn more about Take-Two, and how it stacks up vs. rivals, check out Stock Checkup.It can be tempting to buy a hot IPO when it debuts, but you should wait for the new stock to prove itself. You should always wait for a proper buy point, such as breaking past a sound entry from a bullish base pattern. But that's especially true for IPOs, which have no frame of reference.Snap, which priced its IPO at 17 a share, rose on its first day of trading, and again on its second. But since then shares trended lower.Snap hit a record low of 11.28 on Aug. 14, soon after its disappointing Q2 results. Shares rallied somewhat, and for the past couple of months have been moving sideways around their 50-day line.But unless you're Warren Buffett, you don't want to try to guess the bottom. You might end up just catching a falling knife. Snap showed some positive action in late March and early May, only to head for new lows.Snap seems headed for a big loss Wednesday, though it currently doesn't seem to be threatening its record low.It is very, very hard for companies to compete with Facebook, Amazon.com (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL). They are huge and have vast resources to fight off upstarts. Most of them generally benefit from network effects. The more people who use their network, the more valuable it becomes.Snap has a strong audience of teens and young adults in North America and Europe. But outside of those regions and age groups, Snap now seems surrounded. Facebook has rapidly copied many of Snap's most popular features, especially via Instagram Stories, which has far more users than Snap. So if you haven't already become a regular Snapchat user, there are strong network effects encouraging you to go with the much-larger Facebook ecosystem.Tencent's entry might change this equation. Upstart Tencent now has a huge backer, one that could potentially help fuel growth in new markets.As for Facebook, the social networking giant recently reported blowout third-quarter earnings and accelerating revenue growth, despite its massive size. More than 2 billion people use Facebook. Its shares are currently in buy range from a proper base.Take-Two Interactive, best known for its ""Grand Theft Auto"" video game series, reported stronger-than-expected fiscal second-quarter revenue growth. The video game publisher also guided revenue higher for the holiday Q3, as well as for the full year.Rival video game makers Electronic Arts (EA) and Activision Blizzard (ATVI) both gave weak revenue guidance for the holiday quarter. Shares of both companies retreated since their results.Take-Two shares shot up more than 10% to 117.50 in early trading, suggesting that they'll set a record high Wednesday.The stock has run strongly since gapping out of a base three months ago following its Q1 results. The stock hasn't provided a new entry point, just pulling back modestly in recent days from a record high.RELATED:The Big Picture: These 5 Stocks Made Big MovesTencent Buys 12% Of Snap; Snapchat Parent's Stock Off LowsSnap Revenue, User Growth Short Of Views; Stock DivesTake-Two Interactive Software Beats Sales Target, Guides HigherSquare, Monster Beverage, Roku, Alarm.com Lead Investing Action Plan

Meanwhile, reports surfaced that 21st Century Fox (FOXA) had held talks to sell the bulk of itself to Disney. Iger refused to address ""press speculation"" on the call. Disney rose solidly more than 6%. 21st Century Fox, which reported solid results, shot up 15.5%.On Monday, oil prices rose to their highest levels since mid-2015 on political unrest in the Middle East.

76,TTWO,"As several thousand people file into the KeyArena in Seattle to cheer on their favorite players, the excitement builds. Contestants warm up, fans get charged, and broadcasters speculate breathlessly on what's about to take place.Once the action gets underway, the on-air commentators don't hold back their enthusiasm. At one point, the arena erupts in thunderous cheers when a rather conspicuous player occupying a patch of grass on the field of battle is suddenly blown to bits.""Get off my lawn,"" gushes the wry play-by-play man.A dystopian nightmare? Far from it. It's the International Dota 2 Championship for video-game players, known as ""the Super Bowl of esports,"" all captured for posterity on YouTube. And that ill-fated contestant was an animated character in the game.Some might scoff, but it's no joke — esports are growing up fast. They've been touted as the next big thing in professional sports, attracting millions of young fans and threatening the likes of sporting titans like the National Football League and National Basketball Association — both of which are suffering from declining viewership. At stake for video-game publishers is a potentially lucrative new business that could generate billions in advertising, sponsorships, ticket sales, broadcast rights and related business.Backers of esports believe that the world of professional competitive video games will eventually yield Michael Jordan-level stars that fans will idolize and try to emulate. More than 40 players have racked up earnings in excess of $1 million each from esports tournaments so far. There's even talk about adding esports competitions to the 2024 Olympics in Paris.To be sure, though, video games are not your typical spectator sport.At the recent ""Dota 2"" gathering in Seattle, held in August, the teams of actual live humans operated in relative anonymity behind glass fortresses — an occasional camera shot might have focused on a tense-looking player.Most of the attention, though, went to the spectacular hologram characters selected in an ersatz draft for the coming battle, played out on large video screens over the center stage. Spectators watched the action on a large stage for a prize pool worth $24.8 million. The winners, Europe-based Team Liquid, took home the top prize of $10.8 million, besting a team called Newbee.The hype around esports reached new heights in July as Activision Blizzard (ATVI) started selling teams in its new Overwatch League for a reported $20 million each.The idea of competitive video games as a sport is bound to strike many adults of a certain age as odd. Players sit at PCs or game consoles and control the on-screen action with hand controllers or keyboards and mice. Quick thinking and fast hand-eye coordination are traits of the best esports ""athletes.""""People have yet to legitimize gaming as a credible pastime,"" Benchmark analyst Mike Hickey said. ""It's like the argument over whether golf is a real sport.""But indications are that many young people would rather watch online gaming competitions than traditional sports like football, basketball and soccer. Esports games range from military-strategy shooter games and fantasy role-playing combat games to simulations of real-world sports.""Kids like to watch esports, whether they're players or not,"" Hickey said. And the youthful demographic is highly sought after by advertisers, who have trouble reaching that age group through traditional ads.Esports is ""a big deal,"" Hickey said.Research firm Newzoo predicts that the global audience for esports will reach 385 million this year, made up of 191 million esports enthusiasts plus 194 million occasional viewers. Most of their viewing takes place online. The Asia-Pacific region is expected to account for 51% of the esports enthusiasts this year, with North America making up 13%.Newzoo is forecasting the esports audience to reach 589 million worldwide in 2020, with 51% of those being core esports enthusiasts.Newzoo estimates that the esports market will generate $696 million in sales this year, up 41% from 2016. Of that, sponsorships will account for 38% of revenue, followed by advertising with 22%, game publisher fees at 17%, media rights taking in 14% and merchandise and tickets ringing up 9%.Esports revenue is seen rising to $1.49 billion in 2020, according to Newzoo. But that big number is fragmented by different games and tournament organizers.Companies best positioned to capitalize on the growing esports trend are those that own the games being played, analysts say.The leading publishers in esports now are Activision, Tencent (TCEHY)-owned Riot Games with ""League of Legends,"" and privately held Valve with ""Counter-Strike: Global Offensive"" and ""Dota 2.""Santa Monica, Calif.-based Activision owns the ""Overwatch,"" ""Starcraft,"" ""Hearthstone"" and ""Call of Duty"" franchises, which are already popular in competitive gaming.While Valve allows other companies to run competitions featuring its games, Activision, Tencent's Riot and Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO) are seeking to manage all aspects of esports with their games.On July 12, Activision announced the sale of the first seven team franchises in its upcoming Overwatch League, which is billed as the first major global professional esports league with city-based teams. Those new teams will be based in Boston, New York, Miami-Orlando, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Shanghai and Seoul.On Sept. 20, it completed the first season lineup of 12 city-based teams. It added teams in London, Philadelphia, Dallas and Houston, plus a second team in Los Angeles. The inaugural season for the new arena-based league begins Jan. 10, with preseason matches starting Dec. 6.Meanwhile, Riot Games announced in June that it will franchise the North American League of Legends Championship Series starting in 2018, with teams becoming permanent partners.And Take-Two has launched the NBA 2K esports league with the National Basketball Association. In May, the league announced that 17 NBA teams will participate in the inaugural season, set to debut in 2018.While some video-game publishers like Activision view esports as a significant new revenue stream, others like Electronic Arts (EA) view it as mostly a promotional tool to sell more games and downloadable content.""Esports is going to be an important part of most large-scale video games going forward,"" Baird analyst Colin Sebastian said. ""It's a great way to create more usage and engagement with games.""Plus, esports tournaments offer ""real revenue-generating opportunities on their own,"" he said.In the past, video games mirrored the movie business, with titles generating the bulk of their revenue in a short period of time. Now games can generate significant revenue for years through downloadable content, online services and esports, DFC Intelligence analyst David Cole said.Esports communities can keep a game relevant for a long period of time, Cole said.Most esports tournament viewing is online today through services like Amazon.com (AMZN)-owned Twitch and Alphabet (GOOGL)-owned YouTube. Traditional broadcasters have joined the fray as well, including Walt Disney's (DIS) ESPN and Time Warner's (TWX) Turner Broadcasting. Esports promoters hope to grow the audience for watching competitive gaming in person at arena events, some of which already draw thousands of fans for tournaments.One open question is whether esports fans will take to following the city-based teams proposed by Activision for ""Overwatch"" and Take-Two for ""NBA 2K.""Much of esports viewing centers on major championships for games, not run-of-the-mill matches.Also, esports activity around the top games developed organically over many years, while Activision and Take-Two are trying to drive the esports aspect of their games.""League of Legends"" generates the most online viewership in video games today, getting about 40% to 50% of viewers for competitions and instructional videos, Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter said. ""Dota 2"" and ""CS:GO"" are the next two biggest. ""Overwatch,"" released in May 2016, is fourth, with perhaps 10% of online viewership, Pachter said.The top three games are compelling to watch, while science-fiction shooter game ""Overwatch"" for now isn't, he said. The same goes for Take-Two's pro basketball video game, Pachter said.""EA and Take-Two talk about their sports simulation games,"" Pachter said. ""But the problem is we can already watch real athletes play real sports, so why would we want to watch video gamers play simulated sports?""Analysts will be closely watching the rollout of the Overwatch and NBA 2K leagues to see if they live up to the hype.""The indications seem to be very positive at this point,"" Sebastian said.RELATED:Activision Blizzard Earns Kudos For 'Overwatch' E-Sports MovesThese 3 Stocks Are Plays On The Fast-Growing E-Sports Market

He also called for immigration reform and $1.5 trillion in infrastructure spending.Meanwhile, investors will digest earnings from many top companies today, including Boeing (BA) before the open as well as Facebook (FB) and Microsoft (MSFT) after the close.Workday rose 3.2% to 120.26 in Tuesday's stock market trading after Morgan Stanley upgraded the cloud-based business software firm and William Blair said it recently won two big financial-software deals. That move pushed Workday to the edge of a buying range from a 111.98 cup-with-handle entry point. But it was the first time Workday's breakout seemed impressive.The initial Jan. 23 breakout came on volume that was well below average, and it remained light for the next several sessions. Also, the relative strength line, which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, was lagging. Even as the stock moved into all-time highs, the RS line remained stuck below even short-term peaks.But on Tuesday, trading volume was 51% above normal. And with Workday posting a big gain on a bad market day, its RS line rose to a two-month high.Salesforce fell 0.9% to 112.23, a modest loss on below-average volume. The maker of on-demand customer relationship software is comfortably above a 109.29 flat-base buy point. Salesforce initially cleared the entry point on Jan. 12, but volume was only 25% above normal. That's OK, but you'd really like to see a 40%-50% minimum gain as a sign that institutional buyers are stepping in. The next session, the stock fell back below the entry on similar volume. Salesforce then retook the entry, but on a series of low-volume moves.Also, Salesforce's RS line really hasn't made any progress from short-term levels since the breakout.Red Hat broke out past a 131.03 flat-base entry on Jan. 25, then rose to near the top of the 5% buy zone the next session. Shares have pulled back the last two sessions, including Tuesday's 1.1% on volume that was 34% below normal.The Linux software firm's breakout came on volume that was just above average. The RS line has not made much improvement since then.Electronic Arts closed up 0.9% to 118.70, working toward a 112.89 buy point. After the close, the video game maker met fiscal third-quarter earnings estimates and fell short on revenue. But EA guided higher for the current March quarter.EA shot up 7.8% to 127.95 in premarket trading Wednesday, suggesting a breakout into a buy zone.Keep in mind that extended trading does not always translate into how a stock will open and close the following session.Also, EA's RS line is well below where it was at the start of the five-month consolidation, though it did top a very short-term high this week. Hopefully, EA's after-hours action does carry over to Wednesday with a high-volume price spike.Take-Two fell 0.8% to 118.31 on Tuesday. The stock has topped a 120.28 buy point from a handle in the last two sessions, but failed to close above it. Take-Two rallied early Wednesday in sympathy with peer EA, climbing 1.5% to 120.05, just below the entry.Take-Two's RS line has some distance to the consolidation's highs, but a solid breakout would give it at least a short-term high.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:The Big Picture: Stocks Suffer 2nd Distribution Day; Leaders Hit AgainAlibaba Likely To Show Strongest Revenue Growth In 15 QuartersAbiomed, Arista, Align, YY: How To Read A Stock Rebound3 Fast-Growing Sector Leaders Telling Different Stories Ahead Of EarningsWhat Apple's Stock Chart Is Telling Us Going Into Earnings, iPhone X OutlookAs Market Sold Off, This Small-Cap Tech Stock Rocketed Up; Why?

91,TTWO,"Investors hoping that esports will be a near-term driver of sales and earnings for the major video game publishers are going to be disappointed, a Wall Street analyst said Tuesday.""Over the long run, we believe that esports will be a meaningful new revenue stream for the video game industry,"" Cowen analyst Doug Creutz said in a note to clients. ""However, we expect progress to remain somewhat slow, probably frustratingly so, for any investors basing nearer-term investment theses on esports growth.""Esports involves playing video games competitively for cash prizes in front of audiences, both in person and online. Esports has seen tremendous growth in popularity over the last few years and publishers Activision Blizzard (ATVI), Electronic Arts (EA) and Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO) are angling for a piece of the pie.But there are likely to be few major winners in esports, Creutz said.""We expect that professional esports will come to be dominated by a relatively small number of successful titles (six to eight on a global basis), similar to traditional sports,"" Creutz said.Currently three games dominate the esports scene: Tencent's (TCEHY) ""League of Legends"" and Valve's ""Dota 2"" and ""Counter-Strike: Global Offensive."" Those three games accounted for over 60% of total esports prize money in 2017 and well over half of total esports viewership, Creutz said.""While we think this leaves room for other successful professional esports franchises, the window is not enormously wide,"" he said.Activision is best positioned to break into that group of esports leaders, because it already has esports titles in ""Overwatch,"" ""Hearthstone,"" ""StarCraft"" and ""Heroes of the Storm,"" Creutz said.Earlier this month, Activision officially launched its Overwatch League, which features city-based teams competing in the science-fiction shooter game ""Overwatch."" It's off to a ""respectable start,"" but will need to grow its audience to become a meaningful contributor to Activision's financials, Creutz said.Activision shares fell 1.2% to close at 71.61 on the stock market today.IBD'S TAKE: Activision stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 88, meaning it has outperformed 88% of stocks in key metrics over the past 12 months. For more analysis on Activision and its publicly traded peers, visit the IBD Stock Checkup.Media rights and advertising revenue are keys to making esports a growth driver for publishers, he said.High-water marks in media rights so far are Walt Disney (DIS)-owned BamTech Media paying $300 million for a seven-year deal to stream ""League of Legends"" tournaments and Amazon (AMZN)-owned Twitch paying a reported $90 million for a two-year deal to stream the Overwatch League.""Neither (deal) is terribly material to their respective company's bottom lines (we estimate the Overwatch League deal is worth about 2 cents EPS to Activision),"" Creutz said.Electronic Arts is pushing its FIFA, Madden and Battlefield franchises as esports contenders, while Take-Two is touting NBA 2K as an esport. But those games need to develop esports interest and infrastructure to be successful, Creutz said.By contrast, the top esports games, such as ""League of Legends"" and ""CS:GO,"" developed organically with players and organizations creating tournaments and building audiences online.""While we are relatively bullish on the long-term future of esports, we think its contributions over the next two to three years (at least) are likely to remain small and not terribly incremental to existing business models,"" Creutz said.RELATED:Take-Two Seen Getting Boost From 'Doomsday Heist'Can Esports' Armchair Gladiators Vanquish Hulking NFL Players?

92,TTWO,"The major market averages were on track to start the week on a down note, carrying modest losses in early trade Monday as Wynn Resorts (WYNN) cratered in the stock market today. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite, S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average all moved down around 0.3%.X Among the Dow Jones industrials, Apple (AAPL) fell further under its 50-day line, trading nearly 2% lower. The stock has been a significant underperformer even as it tried to break out above a 176.34 buy point in mid-December. Shares are about 5% below that level ahead of Thursday's earnings release.Elsewhere in the Dow, Goldman Sachs (GS) paced the advancers with a 1.2% rise early Monday. The stock is hitting a new 52-week high and is extended from a 247.17 buy point in an eight-month saucer with handle after a recent test of the 50-day line.FANG stocks Amazon.com (AMZN) and Netflix (NFLX) bucked the market's early fall with rises of 0.6% and 2%, respectively. Both are well-extended from recent buy points after strong advances in 2018.Among companies reporting earnings, Lockheed Martin (LMT) notched a new high with an over-2% rise after the defense contractor topped the Street's Q4 estimates. The stock moved out of buy range from a 322.29 flat-base entry Friday. Shares are now about 9% from that level.Leaderboard name Weibo (WB) fell 3% after the Chinese government suspended several of the company's internet portals for obscene content. Shares are still extended from a cup with handle's 122.31 buy point.Wynn Resorts fell heavily for a second straight day, down another 6% early Monday. On Friday, the casino operator faltered 10% after reported allegations of sexual misconduct by CEO Steve Wynn. Over the weekend, Wynn resigned as finance chief of the Republican National Committee. The stock had been on a tear in 2018, but today's sell-off brings it back to its 50-day line, a key support level.Video game maker Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO) was breaking out with a 1% gain. The stock exceeded a 120.28 buy point in a cup-with-handle base. A potential flaw is the stock's lagging relative strength line.Inside the IBD 50, Chinese leader China Lodging (HTHT) recovered from heavy early losses, but still fell 4%. Shares were testing a 142.90 cup-shaped base entry.Meanwhile, Lam Research (LRCX) fell 3%, as the stock continued lower from last Thursday's earnings-related retreat. The stock looks to be adding a handle to its cup formation, but its relative strength line is weakening.RELATED:What Apple's Stock Chart Is Telling Us Going Into Earnings, iPhone X GuidanceGrubhub, Redhat Lead These Four IBD 50 Stocks In Buy Range7 Reasons The Stock Market Isn't What You Think It IsLooking For Breakout Stocks Like Nvidia?

93,TTWO,"The major market averages again hit record highs Monday amid reports that the U.S. Senate has enough votes to reopen the government. 2018 has already seen quite a few high-quality breakouts, and Monday was no different.  X Halliburton (HAL) is breaking out in the stock market today with a 5% surge above a 53.79 cup-with-handle entry.…
"
94,TTWO,"Investors should be looking for leading stocks breaking out of bullish bases in volume, with their relative strength lines — which track stocks' performance vs. the S&P 500 index  — leading or confirming the breakout.Weibo (WB), Atlassian (TEAM), Match Group (MTCH) and Align Technology (ALGN) cleared buy points in proper bases Tuesday morning with RS lines that were already right at or close to at least short-term highs. But the stocks pulled back or turned negative with the broader market reversal. Only Weibo is in buy range now.X Take-Two Software Interactive (TTWO) also is near a buy point in a proper base with strong RS lines, though it also reversed lower.Weibo and Align Technology have best-possible 99 Composite Ratings, while Atlassian has a 98 Composite Rating. Match Group and Take-Two Interactive are at a solid 92.In recent weeks, many stocks have been hit buy points in lackluster volume with RS lines signaling the stock is just keeping pace with or falling behind the fast-rising S&P 500. Some of those breakouts have not fared well.Weibo, a top Chinese short-message social network, cleared a cup-with-handle base with a buy point of 122.31. Shares rose 1.4% to 123.19 in heavy volume on the stock market today after spiking to 128.37 intraday.Closing near session lows is not great action, but that's better than the general market, which reversed from strong gains to close lower, near the day's worst levels.Weibo's RS line edged past a short-term peak around the handle and neared the old all-time high on the left side of the consolidation. (The RS line is the blue line in the stock charts below.)Keep in mind that Weibo broke out of a late-stage base, which are less likely to succeed or be big winners than a first- or second-stage pattern.Weibo parent Sina (SINA) has been flirting with a double-bottom base buy point of 113.05, briefly crossing that level Friday. Sina fell 0.9% to 111.97 after climbing to 116.11 intraday. Its RS line is lagging more than Weibo's. Sina's RS line was trading right at very short-term highs.Atlassian, a collaboration software maker, is in a cup base with a 53.55 buy point, shot up to 55.25 intraday but pulled back to close with a 0.5% gain at 52.82.The RS line has moved above the short-term high around a pseudo-handle, providing some confirmation of the stock price action. The RS line is still lagging its November highs.Atlassian reports earnings on Thursday.IBD'S TAKE: With the market now in a confirmed rally for 100 days, it can be hard to see who are the true leading stocks and which are in the middle of the pack. See why IBD's relative strength line is so important.Match Group, which operates Match.com, Tinder and other dating sites and apps, is in a consolidation with a 32.97 buy point. That's 10 cents off the old intraday high on Nov. 8 following earnings, but the stock closed well below that peak that day. So as Match Group has consolidated and moved toward its old highs, the RS line has actually moved into new-high ground, bullish and uncommon for base-building stocks in the current market uptrend.Match.com briefly topped the buy point on Jan. 3 but closed lower. Shares ended Friday at 32.64.Match Group rose to 33.08 intraday but reversed to fall 3.8% at 31.40.Take-Two Interactive Software fell 2.85% to 113.96 intraday Tuesday, finding some support just above its 50-day line. As a result of Tuesday's action, the video game stock now has a handle for its consolidation, slightly lowering the potential buy point to 120.28.Take Two's RS line took a hit with Tuesday's sell-off. However, if the stock can break out strongly, the RS line could retake its short-term high around the handle.Align Technology, which makes the Invisalign transparent braces, tumbled from late November to just before Christmas. Shares have rebounded since then, building the right side of a consolidation with a 266.51 entry. Align rose 2.1% to 263.88 after reaching 268 intraday, briefly clearing that entry point.Align's RS line is moving higher, though still off its late November peak. It has risen above a very-short-term high. It also helps that the RS line had such outperformance in 2017, as Align was one of the big stock winners of the year.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Apple's Move Into Buy Range Left Much To Be Desired — And Then There's ThisFacebook Tumbles Below Buy Point; Why Breakout Was Never 'Meaningful'When Will You Know The Top Stocks' Big Runs Are Over?

95,TTWO,"Like big-game hunters zeroing in on their quarry, the co-managers of $1.7 billion Buffalo Discovery Fund (BUFTX) are single-minded about how they stalk stocks. ""We focus on looking for companies whose innovation produces durable growth and competitive advantage,"" co-manager Dave Carlsen said about the process he and co-managers Clay Brethour and Elizabeth Jones use.X Their process has worked. The fund's average annual return was better than the S&P 500's over the trailing one, three, five and 10 years ending Dec. 31. That makes it eligible to earn an IBD Best Mutual Funds Award. Mutual funds that are members of that elite club are in the small minority of funds outperforming in all four time periods. In 2017, the fund was up 25.44% vs. 23.92% on average for midcap growth rivals tracked by Morningstar Direct and 21.83% for the S&P 500.The fund achieved its gain last year with help from leading stocks Align Technology (ALGN), Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO) and Red Hat (RHT), which are up 143%, 131% and 78% respectively since the start of 2017.MSCI (MSCI), Amazon (AMZN) and Facebook (FB) are additional leaders that helped to boost the fund, gaining 67%, 61% and 60%.MSCI is a member of the IBD 50 list of top-performing growth stocks. It's up 5% in this young year.IBD readers recognize that Amazon is near a buy point. Shares broke out Thursday but closed just below the flat base's buy point. Now the stock is back above its proper entry of 1213.51.Facebook, another IBD 50 stock, is also near a buy point — 184.35 in its case, having broken out from a new flat base last week.Brethour, Carlsen and Jones are with Kornitzer Capital Management. They subadvise the fund for Buffalo. The trio — who are ages 48, 49 and 53 — talked with IBD from their offices in Mission, Kansas, about how they hunt for winning stocks.List Of Mutual Fund Quarterly LeadersList Of Mutual Fund Six Month LeadersMF Category PerformanceClick Here To See All Articles In The Best Mutual Funds Performance ReportIBD: What's the central theme in your overall investment approach?Dave Carlsen: This is about seeking innovation in companies. We're looking for companies with innovation, with a new idea that's accepted in the marketplace and leads to shareholder wealth creation or a competitive advantage. We're looking for disruptive ideas that lead to significant share gain or the creation of a brand-new marketplace.We buy positions in growth companies that can grow and gain a competitive advantage regardless of the overall macro economy.IBD: The fund's outperformance over four time periods is rare. How has the fund achieved that consistency?Elizabeth Jones: We've been working together since 2004. That helps. And we each have our strengths and weaknesses. That diversification of strengths has led to more consistent results. When one of us has an interest in a stock that is out of favor, the others might choose stocks that are in favor.That minimizes our downside and maximizes our upside.IBD: Clay or Dave, would you add anything?Clay Brethour: Our process seeks companies that are beneficiaries of 26 secular growth trends. With those growth trends, they have a tailwind no matter what the macro economic situation looks like.IBD: What are some of those trends?Brethour: They're things like the aging demographics, the push for health care cost containment. We look for areas that benefit from durable trends and stay away from here-today-gone-tomorrow fads.IBD: As of your latest disclosure, what do you like about Facebook and what if any are your concerns?Carlsen: The growth in digital advertising impresses us. It's a big market that continues to disrupt. Google and Facebook are winning the lion's share of growth in digital advertising.The time that users spend on Facebook is remarkable, so advertisers like it. Revenues were up 45% in the September quarter vs. the prior year. That gives them pricing (power), which contributes to earnings growth.They're investing in short-form video content, which should build their community and drive consumer engagement higher. And with mobile revenue growth especially robust, Facebook remains well positioned.IBD: Why did you add to your Amazon stake recently?Jones: In Q2 we added to it. We gravitate to smaller companies but make exceptions for exceptional companies. And despite its size, Amazon is still growing rapidly, and it's probably the most innovative company in the world.We define value as translating an idea or innovation into a good or service that customers are willing to pay for. That's what (Amazon founder Jeff) Bezos has done. And he took a risk. He had to create an online marketplace with enough inventory and low enough prices to create value.He innovated in other ways. He needed Amazon Web Services to run his own infrastructure, and he monetized that by offering it to other companies. He realized he could provide content, so we got Amazon Prime Video, Music, Reading. And he wrapped that around the membership offering.We should have owned Amazon sooner. We're happy to own it now.IBD'S TAKE: Amazon is on IBD's exclusive Leaderboard list of top stocks. On Dec. 26, the company trumpeted its biggest holiday sales season ever.IBD: Align Technology (ALGN), the dental braces maker, has pulled back recently. As of your latest disclosure, if you still liked it, tell me why?Brethour: They dominate the clear aligner market and take market share from metal braces, and they continue to expand outside the U.S.(After) they got added to the S&P 500 (in June), they were one of the top four or five performing stocks in the S&P for the year, so some of the (recent) pullback is profit-taking.People underestimate the complexity of manufacturing a customized product (like Align's). And the company is aggressive about expanding into more complex treatment cases.We like it because it benefits everyone. It gives consumers a product they prefer. It helps dental and orthodontic practices. And it gives shareholders good returns and margins.IBD: Any concern about Red Hat's recent pullback after reporting third quarter results?Carlsen: The pullback was basically a case of (not meeting) high expectations. Still, its 20% quarterly (earnings per share) growth is not something you see from everyone in the tech sector. We expect it to continue.What we like is that Red Hat is in the right spot for the evolution of the cloud. They've built a big installed base of users for their Linux enterprise operating system on corporate servers and in the public and private cloud infrastructure. They allow a company's on-premises infrastructure to mesh with the public cloud infrastructure like Amazon's AWS or Microsoft's Azure. The public cloud is cheaper and more efficient for some uses. A company might keep its email on the public cloud, for example, but they may want to keep product development on-premise for security.Red Hat is positioned to bridge the gap between the private and public cloud, making innovation more efficient going forward.IBD: Why did Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO) drop recently after making a great run up?Jones: I don't think the pullback was anything in particular. A lot of growth stocks pulled back. Also, Electronic Arts (EA), another gaming company, made some changes to a new release, reducing the number of microtransactions that players buy on the side, and maybe that caused collateral damage to Take-Two and Activision (ATVI).But we don't believe those will impact the company's ability to meet our projections in the long run.Historically, the company is at a disadvantage by the boom-bust cycle in games releases. They'd have a lot of sales, then dramatic declines. But that's changing due to online gaming and multiplayer gaming, which are extending individual game lifetimes. Instead of new releases every five to seven years, the company is shifting to incremental releases delivered digitally, which have a higher margin and more opportunities for microtransactions, those side purchases by players that give them an advantage in a game. Those are why the stock has done well this year.In addition, the market anticipates two new releases next year. One will be Red Dead Redemption 2, which is highly anticipated.IBD: Why do you like MSCI (MSCI), which for example runs many indexes tracked by investors?Brethour: About 98% of their revenues are recurring. They have significant cash flow. And they only need a low capital expenditure to build their business going forward.They're a beneficiary of the shift to passive investing. As active managers, we are aware of that shift and want to seek ways to benefit from it. MSCI is a clear choice. Trillions of dollars are benchmarked to their indices.And now they're laying the groundwork to become the standard for ESG (environmental-, social- and governance-impact) investing. That should provide an additional avenue of growth going forward.IBD: Elizabeth, you are an M.D. How do you use that expertise as a manager for this fund?Jones: My experience in pricing medicine has given me unique insight to health care. I spend 70% to 75% of my time on health care in the fund, looking for things that offer consumers a good value. As Dave mentioned, we look for innovators. The key for them is having value. It's got to be a good deal for the consumer.With my background, I can assess that, especially in terms of the interface between doctors and patients.IBD: Dave and Clay, do either of you have unusual career trajectories?Carlsen: Like Clay, my career path has been pretty traditional.RELATED:Stock To Watch: Who Joins Apple, BofA On List Of New Buys By Top FundsIf You're Looking For Actionable Stocks, Check Our Stock Lists Page For Stocks Near Buy Zones, Stocks Hitting New Highs, Sector Leaders, Tech Leaders, IPO Leaders And MoreYou Need This Much Retirement Savings At Your Age And IncomeWhere To Find Income Without Taking Big Risks

96,TTWO,"Early gains faded in late-afternoon trading Wednesday as the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq waged a battle at their 50-day moving averages, a key support level.X The Dow Jones industrial average added 0.4%, helped by strength in Boeing (BA), Walmart (WMT) and United Technologies (UTX), which showed gains of around 2% or more. The S&P 500 added 0.1% and the Nasdaq composite lagged with a decline of 0.3%. Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq was tracking well below Tuesday's levels.The 10-year Treasury yield was up 4 basis points to 2.84%, near the 2.86% level hit Monday when indexes sold off violently.Semiconductor stocks and oil and gas names lagged badly.At the New York Mercantile Exchange, U.S. crude oil futures settled at $61.79 a barrel, down 2.5%, after the Energy Information Administration said U.S. crude production hit 10.25 million barrels last week, the first time production has topped the 10 million mark in about four decades.Chipmakers fell hard, hurt in part by weak earnings from Macom (MTSI) and Microchip Technology (MCHP). Shares of Macom, one of the worst performers in the group, crashed 35% while Microchip gave up support at the 200-day moving average, falling 8%.In the stock market today, heavy-volume gainers included Wynn Resorts (WYNN). Shares jumped nearly 8% to 175.70 on news CEO Steve Wynn is resigning due to sexual misconduct allegations.Lululemon Athletica (LULU), meanwhile, jumped 3% to 81. CEO Laurent Potdevin announced his resignation earlier in the week, in part due to a relationship with a female employee. Canaccord Genuity on Tuesday mentioned former Ralph Lauren (RL) CEO Stefan Larsson as a possible successor.Inside the IBD 50, Nvidia (NVDA) followed through after rising nearly 6% Tuesday and reclaiming the 50-day moving average. Shares were up 2% to 230.28. Earnings are due Thursday after the close.Tesla (TSLA) picked up 2% ahead of its earnings report after the close. Tesla is trading just above the 200-day moving average, but its 50-day line is below the 200-day line, indicating generally sluggish price performance in recent months. Tesla has been in a consolidation since September.Video game maker Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO) also reports after the close. It's trading just above the 50-day moving average but slightly below a 120.72 entry. Shares edged higher to 118.45 ahead of the results.RELATED:Tesla Model 3 Production Will Be Key Focus Of Quarterly ReportThese 2 Top Retail Stocks Are Hitting New Highs In Volatile MarketThinking Of Buying FANG Name Facebook?

97,TTWO,"The Nasdaq led the market's weak start to the final week of September as investors continue to fret about the possibility of military conflict between the U.S. and North Korea.XInvestors also seem frustrated with the inability of Congress to pass meaningful reforms in either health care regulations or in the American tax code.The tech-driven Nasdaq composite lost 0.9%, its worst decline since a 1.9% sell-off on Aug. 17. At one point the index was down as much as 1.3%.At 6370, the leading major index of 2017 is making a test of the rising 50-day moving average for at least the third time since August.The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrials both fell around 0.2%. Volume jumped sharply on both major exchanges, according to early data, and pointed to a fresh distribution day, or a session of unusually intense institutional selling.IBD's TAKE: A flurry of distribution days in a short span of time to can mark the moment that stocks are headed into a significant correction and drag all equities lower. In a distribution day, either the Nasdaq composite or the S&P 500 must fall at least 0.2% and volume must rise vs. the prior trading session. Keep track of these important sessions in the market by seeing the Market Pulse table in The Big Picture column.While breadth on the Nasdaq exchange is negative with losing issues beating winners by roughly 300 stocks, on the NYSE, the opposite was the case as advancers led decliners by a nearly 4-3 margin, according to preliminary figures.Meanwhile, a growing number of leadership-quality names fell below their 50-day moving averages, which can be seen as a sign that the bull market is tired and some stocks may be poised for a serious correction.Electronic Arts (EA) sank below its 50-day moving average as shares dropped nearly 4% to 114.20. Volume jumped around 65% above typical levels. The video game publisher survived a test of intermediate-term support back in the end of June.On June 29, when EA dipped below the 50-day moving average, volume was slightly heavier than normal, but the stock ended the session above that support level. In the next four trading sessions, EA explored further below the 50-day line, but volume was light. The stock eventually retook the 50-day in mid-July.EA's Computer Software-Gaming industry group has been a huge winner this year and is currently ranked No. 4 out of 197 industry groups in terms of six-month relative price performance. However, on Monday the sell-off in EA was not isolated. Fellow group leaders Activision-Blizzard (ATVI) and Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO) both dropped sharply, and the former clipped its own 50-day moving average in turnover that tracked 59% above its 50-day average.Adobe Systems (ADBE) dropped almost 2.7% to 144.57 and fell further below the 50-day line. Volume was sharp, easily more than double its 50-day average. Judging by the action on a daily chart, it appears the digital marketing and graphics software firm is poised to make a new base.When Adobe undercut its 50-day line sharply in November last year, it went on to challenge support at the 200-day moving average and eventually bottomed out. Today, Adobe's 200-day moving average is currently around 133, rising and catching up with the stock.Indian lending giant HDFC Bank (HDB) gapped lower at the open and undercut its 50-day line with a 3.2% drop to 94.09. Shares are still up a solid 28% since a mid-March breakout past a 73.42 buy point in an excellent cup with handle. However, keep in mind that taking gains in most of your stocks at 20% to 25% can lead to handsome long-term results.Apple (AAPL) spent a fourth straight session below its 50-day moving average as the stock slipped 0.9% to 150.55. Volume was heavy.

98,TTWO,"Video game software will disappear from retail store shelves in about six years, investment bank Piper Jaffray predicts, as 100% of console video games to be purchased as digital downloads around 2023.This year, about 40% of console video games will be purchased as digital downloads, Piper Jaffray analyst Michael Olson said in a report Monday.The shift to digital downloads of full games and add-on content is already boosting the bottom lines of major video game publishers such as Activision Blizzard (ATVI), Electronic Arts (EA) and Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO). By selling direct to consumers, publishers skip the retail middlemen and pocket a higher profit margin.""It's possible the market reaches 'critical mass' at 70% to 80% full-game downloads in a few years and spikes to 100% more rapidly,"" Olson said. ""Also, streaming games from the cloud, while still in very early stages, could drive more rapid digital shift. In any case, the major publicly traded video game publishers will see margin expansion and (earnings) growth as the industry approaches 100% digital.""IBD'S TAKE: Electronic Arts is currently ranked No. 16 on the IBD 50 list of top-performing growth stocks.The shift to digital downloads has weighed on specialty retailer GameStop (GME), which has been diversifying into mobile phones, consumer electronics and pop-culture products to offset declining game sales.Digital sales are expected to make up 80% of revenue this year for Activision Blizzard, including full-game downloads, add-on content and subscription services. Meanwhile, digital is expected to account for 65% of revenue this year for EA and 66% for Take-Two, Olson said.Olson rates shares of Activision, EA and Take-Two as overweight. He has a price target on Activision stock of 69, with EA at 128 and Take-Two at 100.By the closing bell on the stock market today, Activision surged 4% to 64.26. EA was up 1.9% to 119.03, and Take-Two was up 3.2% 94.95.RELATED:Activision Stock Gets Blizzard Of Price-Target IncreasesElectronic Arts Stock Climbs Back Into Buy ZoneVideo Game Publisher Take-Two Rockets On June-Quarter Beat

For more analysis on Take-Two and its peers, visit IBD Stock Checkup.""In the past, the knock against the company had always been that it was overly reliant on just a few games, most notably 'Grand Theft Auto,' creating a lumpy, unpredictable, and risky earnings stream,"" Johnson said.""But in the digital era this is a competitive advantage,"" he added. ""By having some of the highest-quality games, and periodically dropping additional content, Take-Two can keep its players engaged and spending in its games without having to reinvent the wheel every 3-5 years. The company's earnings stream is now predictable, reliable, and much less risky.""RELATED:'Grand Theft Auto' Game Maker Crushes Views; Stock Seen As A Steal

111,TTWO,"The S&P 500 index and other major averages had their first down week of 2018, and it was their worst showing in two years. Apple (AAPL) guided lower, as many suspected. Amazon (AMZN) and Boeing (BA) delivered strong results while Facebook (FB) touted strong ad rates. Alibaba (BABA) missed on earnings. PayPal (PYPL) crashed as former parent eBay (EBAY) moved to cut ties. A move by Amazon, JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) to team up to tackle health care costs hit insurers and pharmacy benefit managers. The Bitcoin meltdown continuedX After a hot start to 2018, the major averages suffered their worst weekly losses in two years, with the S&P 500 down 3.9%, the Dow 4.1% and the Nasdaq 3.5% as rising bond yields worldwide pressured stocks. UnitedHealth (UNH), CVS Health (CVS) and many other insurers fell on an Amazon-JPMorgan-Berkshire health care joint venture. Amazon, Boeing and Facebook were earnings winners, Alibaba was a notable loser, while Apple (AAPL) did OK.Bitcoin plummeted below $8,000 as 2018 losses accelerate as Facebook joined a chorus of regulators worldwide cracking down on cryptocurrencies.Apple (AAPL) earnings per share rose 16% year over year, on sales of $88.3 billion, up 13%, for the fiscal first quarter. Both narrowly beat expectations. Apple sold 77.3 million iPhones vs. the consensus for 80 million units, but average selling prices due to its new iPhone X and iPhone 8 models fueled overall results. For the March quarter, Apple expects sales of $61 billion, based on the midpoint of guidance, below official estimates for $65.4 billion. Shares fell 4.3% on Friday to a new three-month low.The e-commerce leader reported adjusted earnings of $3.75 a share, smashing the consensus of $1.85. A big benefit from tax cuts helped. Revenue rose 38% to $60.5 billion, also beating. Revenue from Amazon Web Services rose 46% to $5.1 billion. Sales of its Echo line of smart speakers far exceed expectations, Amazon (AMZN) said. Shares gained 3%, hitting a new high intraday.Facebook (FB) reported robust earnings and revenue growth that topped Q4 forecasts.

Shares hit a record high Thursday.Alphabet (GOOGL) shares fell after the Google parent reported Q4 adjusted earnings were $9.70 a share, up 28% from a year earlier, missing views. Traffic acquisition costs, what Google pays partner websites to carry ads, soared 33% to $6.45 billion. Google expects the rise in TAC to moderate after Q1. Google's rising TAC has been linked to a contract renewal with Apple as well as internet searches shifting to mobile phones. Revenue rose 24% to $32.32 billion, topping consensus. The adjusted EPS excluded the impact of tax reform, which resulted in additional expense of $9.9 billion.Amazon's Jeff Bezos, JPMorgan's Jamie Dimon and Berkshire's Warren Buffett said the new nonprofit company is aimed at reducing costs for their employees.

Earnings per U.S. share climbed 25%, but slightly missed forecasts. Alibaba will buy a 33% stake in Ant Financial, a former unit that runs payments service Alipay. That replaces a deal in which Alibaba got 37.5% of Ant Financial's pretax profit. Alibaba will provide some intellectual property but not cash. The move clears hurdles for a possible Ant Financial IPO. Alibaba shares 8.7% for the week, tumbling below a recent buy point.The U.S. added 200,000 jobs in January, better than expected. Average hourly wages surged 2.9% vs. a year earlier, far above views and the best since 2009. The ISM manufacturing index continued to point to raid employment gains. While fast growth and wage gains are good news, they could spur the Federal Reserve to raise rates more aggressively this year.The software leader reported adjusted earnings per share of 96 cents, up 20% year over year, on sales of $28.9 billion, up 12%, for its fiscal second quarter. Analysts expected 86 cents and $28.4 billion. Microsoft got a lift from its cloud computing businesses, including Azure, Office 365 and Dynamics.

Visa also OK'd a $7.5 billion buyback. That follows American Express (AXP), which just suspended its buyback. Visa also hiked its quarterly cash dividend to 21 cents a share.Homebuilder stocks continued to struggle even as some big builders reported better-than-expected earnings after the prior week's surprise miss by NVR (NVR). Housing demand and prices are strong, but concerns are growing over rising labor and material costs. Mortgage rates, though low, are rising. America's largest homebuilder D.R. Horton (DHI) beat on both EPS and revenue Wednesday, but shares met resistance at their 50-day line. PulteGroup (PHM) stock kept falling on sliding gross margins, even though earnings and sales topped views. Smaller Meritage Homes (MTH) also beat while smaller M/I Homes (MHO)  and M.D.C. Holdings (MDC) missed on EPS.A slew of biotechs and drugmakers reported earnings, including Pfizer (PFE), Eli Lilly (LLY), Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX), AstraZeneca (AZN) and Merck (MRK), all of which topped Wall Street's fourth-quarter earnings expectations.

Both shares plunged below their 50-day lines, with Chevron undercutting a recent buy point. Separately, U.S. crude production continues to hit fresh longtime highs, while crude supplies rose for the first time in 11 weeks. Crude futures remain near three-year highs.Ferrari (RACE) gapped into a buy zone after reporting strong earnings Thursday. Meanwhile, U.S. auto sales slumped in January, with big declines from Ford (F) and Fiat Chrysler (FCAU). GM (GM) sales edged higher, but missed views. Toyota (TM) sales skyrocketed on strong truck sales.

112,TTWO,"Stock fought to a positive finish on Wednesday, as health care and construction stocks booked some of the day's widest losses, while video-game stocks notched a bevy of breakouts.X The Dow Jones industrial average led, ending up 0.3%, boosted by Boeing's (BA) monster 5% advance, on the heels of its glowing Q4 results. The Nasdaq Composite rose 0.1%, while the S&P 500 struggled to a fractional gain.Markets dropped sharply after the Fed's 2 p.m. ET announcement. The committee held its target interest rate unchanged, but offered a slightly more wary tone on inflation. The day's other economic news was positive, with early data from ADP showing January hiring slipped less than expected, while December pending home sales and a Chicago-region manufacturing for January gauge easily topped expectations.The Dow was held back some by medical components Merck (MRK), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Pfizer (PFE), which all dropped more than 2%. Drugmaker Eli Lilly (LLY) tumbled 5%, following a generally positive fourth-quarter report. But drug sector investors were apparently still reacting to Tuesday's news of an innovative health care partnership between Amazon.com (AMZN), Berkshire Hathaway (BRKA) and JPMorgan (JPM).Amazon advanced 1.5%, putting it 20% past its 1213.10 buy point and in a profit-taking zone. The other three FANG stock tech leaders lost ground. Netflix (NFLX) fell furthest, down nearly 3%, but still extended after its early January breakout.Tesla (TSLA) rose 2.5% in average trade, for its third gain in four sessions. Shares are now up more than 20% from their November low and back above support at their 10- and 40-week moving averages, climbing the right side of a possible four-month base pattern.The video game trade was among the day's winners, with Ninetendo (NTDOY), Take-Two Interactive (TTWO) and Electronic Arts (EA) all clearing buy points or adding to entries. Ninetendo trimmed gains in afternoon trade, but remained just beyond buy range above a cup-base buy point at 54.06. Electronic Arts pared its advance and held in its buy range, after topping a 122.89 buy point, also from a cup base.Take-Two chalked up a 7% surge to end at the very top of a buy range above a 120.72 cup base buy point.Concrete and aggregates suppliers took the session's worst performance among industries, with U.S. Concrete (USCR) tumbling more than 6%, Eagle Materials (EXP) down 5% and Martin Marietta (MLM) and Vulcan Materials (VMC) falling 3% apiece. Eagle materials posted a mixed fourth quarter report before the open, but the reaction could also have been linked to public-private infrastructure cost-sharing questions raised in President Trump's State Of The Union address.Among IBD 50 names, telecom software developer Casa Systems (CASA) gained more than 6% in soft trade. The stock is attempting to start the right side of its first base, ending about 10% below its Jan. 16 high and 46% above its December IPO price.Argentina-based bank Grupo Servielle (SUPV), also an IBD 50 name, jumped almost 5% in nearly average trade. The move technically placed the stock in a buy range on a rebound from support at its 10-week moving average. But volume would need to kick in over the next day or so in order to confirm the buying opportunity.At the bottom of the IBD 50 list, MiMedx Group (MDXG) and Daqo New Energy (DQ) each shed about 5%.Other Important Market News For Wednesday:Bring Your Game As Apple, Amazon, Alphabet Report: Action PlanBiggest U.S. Homebuilder Hits Resistance, Despite 40% Earnings GainHow To Sell: Don't Freeze If Double-Digit Gain In A Stock Shrinks FastLooking For Breakout Stocks Like Nvidia?

EA shares surged 7% to close at 126.96 on the stock market today. Earlier in the session, EA carved an all-time high of 131.The highlight of EA's fiscal third-quarter report was the acceleration in its Live Services business due to strength of Ultimate Team for FIFA and Madden NFL games, Credit Suisse analyst Stephen Ju said in a report to clients.""The trade-off for better-than-expected recurring revenue in Live Services vs. unit volume sales from a new release is one that we will gladly make as it creates a greater upward bias to our long-term estimates,"" Ju said. He reiterated his outperform rating on EA stock and raised his price target to 143 from 131.Late Tuesday, EA delivered adjusted earnings per share of $2.19, in line with estimates, on adjusted sales of $1.97 billion, below the consensus target of $2.07 billion, for the December quarter.For the March quarter, EA guided to non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.14 on sales of $1.2 billion, both topping views. Analysts were modeling $1.08 and $1.18 billion.Strength in EA's sports games helped to offset disappointing sales of the company's big holiday game ""Star Wars Battlefront 2.""IBD'S TAKE: Electronic Arts stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 87 out of a best-possible 99.

The Japanese company said it could have sold more, but was supply constrained during the period.RELATED:Electronic Arts Stock Rises Late On Upbeat March-Quarter GuidanceEsports Business Likely To Frustrate Investors: AnalystTake-Two Seen Getting Boost From 'Doomsday Heist'Activision Gets Price-Target Hike On 'Call Of Duty: WWII' Strength

114,TTWO,"The 2018 outlook for video game publishers is bright, thanks to secular trends such as higher margin full-game downloads and in-game microtransactions, a Wall Street brokerage firm said Thursday.""We remain positive on the group and believe digital revenue growth, both add-on content and full-game downloads, can provide an underlying tailwind through 2018,"" Piper Jaffray analyst Michael Olson said in a note to clients. ""In particular, we expect to see accelerating momentum around the mix shift toward full-game downloads.""He reiterated his overweight ratings on Activision Blizzard (ATVI), Electronic Arts (EA) and Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO).Despite some recent concerns about the use of microtransactions to drive incremental sales, game publishers are likely to continue the practice, Olson said. ""Star Wars Battlefront 2"" from Electronic Arts was criticized for making microtransactions more of a ""pay to win"" strategy than about purchases of cosmetic items. EA suspended in-game purchases in the title to rework its strategy.Cowen analyst Doug Creutz on Thursday lowered his price target on EA, largely on the company's missteps with ""Star Wars Battlefront 2."" He reiterated his market perform rating on EA, but trimmed his price target to 104 from 106.IBD'S TAKE: For a roundup of 2018 predictions for the stock market, visit the IBD page ""2018 Stock Market Outlook: What To Watch For In The New Year.""EA shares dropped 0.4% to close at 107.97 on the stock market today. Activision was up 1.1% to finish at 65.08, and Take-Two climbed 1.6% 110.46.""We believe that 'Star Wars Battlefront 2's' performance (lower units plus the indefinite delay of microtransactions) has been disappointing enough to more than offset any strength elsewhere in the model,"" Creutz said. He cut his estimate for unit sales of the new Star Wars game to 11 million from 14 million for fiscal 2018.The three major independent game publishers have solid pipelines of new titles coming in 2018, Piper Jaffray's Olson said. Leading the pack is the release of Western action game ""Red Dead Redemption 2"" from Take-Two in the second quarter of 2018. The biggest game of the year could be Activision's ""Call of Duty: Black Ops 4,"" due out next November.RELATED:Activision, Take-Two Nab Fresh Buy Ratings, EA Started At Neutral

115,TTWO,"LGI Homes (LGIH), NVR (NVR), Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO), Activision Blizzard (ATVI), Lending Tree (TREE) and Interactive Brokers (IBKR) had a terrific 2017 — and so did the industry groups of which these winning stocks form a part.X The top industry groups of 2017 include homebuilders, video game makers, mortgage firms and trading brokerages. Meanwhile, apparel and shoe retailers, coal producers and oil-and-gas drillers enjoyed a year-end burst of performance. Momentum in those groups is worth watching into 2018.LGI Homes and NVR have surged 161% and 102% this year, while homebuilding peers KB Home (KBH), D.R. Horton (DHI) and Pulte Group (PHM) have fared almost as well, with gains ranging from 81% to 102%. They are benefiting from pent-up millennial demand as well as broad strength in the economy.The residential/commercial-building industry group, as a whole, soared 99.4% for the year and 23.1% in the final quarter of 2017. But headwinds loom.The housing sector tumbled in early November after the GOP tax reform plan set a cap on deductions for mortgages and property taxes. It has recovered since, but critics maintain the cap knocks back homebuilding and housing-related companies by making homeownership less affordable.Take-Two Interactive and Activision Blizzard soared 123% and 75%. Video game publishing peers Nintendo (NTDOY), NetEase (NTES), Zynga (ZNGA) and Electronic Arts (EA) follow, with gains of 74%, 60%, 56% and 33% respectively.The stocks have gained ground as the industry shifts to higher-margin digital distribution and looks for opportunities to monetize downloadable content. Esports, or professional video game competitions, are seen as another long-term growth driver.The gaming software industry group gained 78.7% this year, despite a 1.2% retreat in the fourth quarter.Lending Tree skyrocketed 236% higher, while Essent Tree (ESNT), CoreLogic (CLGX) and HFF Inc. (HF) boast gains ranging from 70% to 25%.These mortgage and mortgage insurance providers benefit, as homebuilders do, from housing's growth and strength in the sector. Essent expects robust expansion of the housing market over the next few years.The mortgage and related financial services group has risen 70.9% for the year and 17.6% in the final quarter of 2017.IBD'S TAKE: For a roundup of 2018 predictions for the stock market, visit the IBD page ""2018 Stock Market Outlook: What To Watch For In The New Year.""Interactive Brokers jumped 62% this year.

126,TTWO,"A possible crackdown by the Securities and Exchange Commission on companies reporting adjusted revenue and earnings could have a big impact on video game companies, Baird analyst Colin Sebastian said in a research report Thursday.The SEC says it may place restrictions in the near term on the use and reporting of non-GAAP revenue and eventually non-GAAP earnings. Unlike Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, non-GAAP reporting lets companies factor out items, such as stock-based compensation, from earnings. The great majority of tech companies report non-GAAP earnings and some report non-GAAP revenue, though as required they also report GAAP earnings and provide a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP numbers.""While these changes should not impact company operations, cash flow, or intrinsic values, investors should be aware of the potential for headline confusion and/or some additional modeling complexity,"" Sebastian said, in one of the first analyst reports to deal with this issue. At an address at a conference this month, Mary Jo White, chairwoman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, criticized the prevalent use of non-GAAP financial reporting.SEC changes that could restrict non-GAAP accounting would impact video game publishers, including Activision Blizzard (ATVI), Electronic Arts (EA), Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO) and Zynga (ZNGA), Sebastian said.IBD Take: Activision ranks third in its group, find out why at IBD Stock Checkup.Today, video game publishers defer a portion of revenue for online-enabled games over a period of time when users are likely to access online content and services, he said.""As such, non-GAAP revenues excluding the impact of deferrals would be higher than GAAP revenues in video game launch quarters, but lower than GAAP in subsequent quarters,"" Sebastian said. ""On an annualized basis, the difference between GAAP and non-GAAP revenues is limited; however, on a quarterly basis, there can be significant differences that we believe could cause some headline confusion.""For instance, for the June quarter, EA guided to GAAP revenue of $1.25 billion and non-GAAP revenue of $640 million.Video game publishers use non-GAAP revenue because it is arguably more representative of quarterly operating performance and business trends, Sebastian said.Among the top publicly traded video game publishers, it appears that Take-Two would face the largest impact an SEC restriction on non-GAAP revenue reporting, according to the analyst.He said such changes, though, would allow better apples-to-apples comparisons of video game publishers.Sebastian rates Activision and EA stocks as outperform and Take-Two and Zynga stocks as neutral.As stocks continued to rebound from their post-Brexit fall, shares of Activision closed up 4.2% in the stock market today, and and Zynga rose 2.9%, while shares of EA added 2.7% and Take-Two rose 3.55%.

129,TTWO,"With the Electronic Entertainment Expo, better known as E3, drawing to a close in Los Angeles, Wall Street analysts are chiming in with their thoughts on which publicly traded companies performed the best at the annual trade show and which came up short.Several analysts proclaimed ""Battlefield 1,"" a World War I combat game from Electronic Arts (EA), as the title with the most positive buzz at E3.Baird analyst Colin Sebastian said “Battlefield 1” stole the show. He also was impressed with EA's sci-fi action game ""Titanfall 2.""""Given the initial positive feedback on 'Battlefield 1,' coupled with improved 'Titanfall 2' functionality (now includes single-player campaign), we believe management's current guidance could prove overly conservative,"" Sebastian said in a research report. He rates EA stock as outperform, with a price target of 80. EA rose 0.8% to 75 on the stock market today.Meanwhile, Activision Blizzard (ATVI) overcame negative pre-show buzz for its game ""Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare"" and won over some skeptics.“Before E3, many investors were concerned about the negative reception for (Activision's) ‘Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare’ trailer,” Pacific Crest Securities analyst Evan Wilson said in a report. “However, we think CoD showed better this week.”Wilson rates Activision stock as overweight with a price target of 43. Activision climbed 1.8% to 39.03 on Thursday.Still ""Infinite Warfare"" faces ""stiff competition"" from ""Battlefield 1,"" Piper Jaffray analyst Michael Olson said in a report. “Infinite Warfare” is set for release on Nov. 4, following two big EA titles. “Battlefield 1” comes out on Oct. 21 and “Titanfall 2” drops on Oct. 28.The highlight for Activision at E3 came not from the show floor, but from an upbeat report about its recently launched sci-fi shooter game ""Overwatch."" Activision announced during the show that it has over 10 million users for ""Overwatch"" worldwide since the game's release on May 24.Baird's Sebastian raised his price target on Activision stock to 43 from 42 on Thursday based on the ""Overwatch"" news. He maintained his outperform rating on the stock.“While users will likely exceed unit sell-through due to time-based usage in Asia and disc-sharing, we now expect material upside to our original 6 million unit expectation,” he said. “As such, we are increasing our Q2 fiscal 2016 estimates to reflect 8.5 million unit sales.”What’s more, his firm’s checks in China suggest that “Overwatch” is taking significant share from Tencent’s (TCEHY) “League of Legends,” at least temporarily, Sebastian said.On the downside, Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO) disappointed analysts and fans at E3 by not announcing any big new titles.“The Street’s biggest takeaway from Take-Two’s E3 2016 will be the lack of an announcement for the next ‘Red Dead’ (or any other new IP), despite a strong showing for ‘Mafia 3’ and ‘Civilization 6’ at the event,” Piper's Olson said. “‘Mafia 3’ in particular could be the critical cog for the company to reach its internal goals. However, little was discussed related to ‘Borderlands,’ ‘Red Dead’ or any other new IP, which is the primary focus of most investors.”Here's our interview with Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick from E3.Olson rates Take-Two stock as overweight with a price target of 40. Take-Two rose 0.7% to 37.77 on Thursday.Pacific Crest's Wilson called Take-Two's game slate this year ""uninspired.""Another letdown at E3 was the lack of major AAA game titles for new virtual-reality headsets from Sony (SNE), HTC and Facebook's (FB) Oculus.The major game publishers are unwilling to devote resources to VR games until the installed base of headsets makes the market opportunity worthwhile, Jefferies analyst Brian Pitz said in a report.“From a publisher perspective, VR looks more like a 2018 story (at the) earliest,” Pitz said. “Every management team we spoke with had the same two concerns about VR. First, what kind of games will succeed on VR? Second, how long will gamers be willing to wear the headsets?”The three-day E3 conference officially opened Tuesday at the Los Angeles Convention Center, but several large companies held pre-show events.RELATED:‘Clash Of Clans’ Game Maker Possible $9 Billion Takeover TargetElectronic Arts Impresses At E3; Why Take-Two’s Stock Sold OffWedbush’s Pachter On The ‘Conspiracy Theory’ Behind EA’s E3 Snub

Meanwhile, Brexit fears sent bond yields tumbling worldwide. The German 10-year bund went negative for the first time and the 10-year Treasury yield hit 2012 levels, though both closed well off those lows. The S&P 500 joined the Nasdaq and Dow in undercutting its 50-day line. The Nasdaq fell below its 200-day average.  Energy stocks fell with oil prices, while American Air and global peers tumbled on Brexit and terror fears.The Federal Reserve left interest rates alone, as expected, in the wake of the weak May jobs report and concerns over the looming Brexit vote.

Meanwhile, Sony (SNE) set an Oct. 13 release date for PlayStation VR.Analysts say Electronic Arts (EA) games ""Battlefield 1"" and ""Titanfall 2"" captured the most positive buzz, though EA was not on E3's show floor but at its own event across the street. Take-Two Interactive (TTWO) shares fell amid the absence of new game title announcements. Analysts said the lack of major game titles for new virtual-reality headsets was a letdown, but publishers don't want to devote their resources until the VR market becomes more established.Meanwhile, Chinese messaging giant Tencent Holdings (TCEHY) reportedly is close to a $9 billion takeover deal for ""Clash of Clans"" creator Supercell. Tencent owns Riot Games, which runs the popular ""League of Legends"" game.Oracle (ORCL) reported fourth-quarter earnings per share minus items of 81 cents, up 4% from a year earlier, meeting views and ending a four-quarter string of year-over-year EPS declines.Revenue fell 1% to $10.6 billion, the fifth straight quarterly decline but slightly above the consensus of $10.47 billion.  The business software powerhouse is shifting from on-premise software licensed for the long term to software-as-a-service delivered via the cloud.

It was Alibaba's first financial preview since coming public in 2014, and comes as the company faces an investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission into accounting practices.Meanwhile, China search engine leader Baidu (BIDU) late Monday cut its Q2 revenue forecast about 10%, citing advertising cuts and delays by health care firms. Baidu faced public outrage and regulatory probes after the death of a college student who accused Baidu of leading him to a false cancer treatment. Baidu has tried to address the problem with changes to its paid search program, which promote paid content above other listing results.Baidu stock is off 1% for the week. Alibaba rallied 1.4%.Kroger (KR) first-quarter sales rose 4.7% to $3.46 billion, a bit lighter than analysts' consensus, hurt by low fuel prices at its gas stations. Same-store sales minus fuel rose 2.4%. Earnings per share climbed 13% to 70 cents, beating estimates by a penny, as cost curbs lifted operating margins. But the grocery giant sees full-year  EPS at the low end of its guidance due to gas margins.Kroger shares fell 4.4% this week.Meanwhile, the FDA accused Whole Foods Market (WFM) of ""filth"" and other unsanitary conditions at an Everett, Mass., facility. Shares of the organic and natural foods grocer have tumbled nearly 10.9% so far this week.Symantec (SYMC) stock rocketed 15.5% this week to a 52-week high after the No. 2 cybersecurity firm said it would buy Blue Coat Systems for $4.65 billion before the privately held cloud security firm could launch an initial public offering. Blue Coat is a market leader in secure web gateway products and other segments. Blue Coat CEO Greg Clark will head up Symantec. Symantec CEO Mike Brown announced last month he would step down, as the company reported fiscal Q4 sales that missed expectations and said it would cut 1,200 jobs and close a quarter of its offices.The Energy Information Administration said U.S. crude production fell 0.3% to 8.716 million barrels of oil per day after rising the week before. Stockpiles fell by 993,000, less than expectations for a decline of 1.4 million barrels, but below the American Petroleum Institute's estimate that U.S. stockpiles rose by 1.2 million barrels. The International Energy Agency said it saw its first ""significant drop"" in supply since 2013 in May and that oil markets will likely balance in the second half of the year. OPEC also sees oil markets in balance by year-end. Meanwhile, U.S. rigs in operation rose for a third straight week to an eight-week high, a sign of stabilization after oil prices rebounded strongly from January lows.But prices fell sharply as Brexit fears raised growth worries and propped up the dollar. Oil prices fell 2.2% to $47.98 a barrel, but closed well off weekly lows.The ISIS-inspired mass shooting of a gay nightclub in Orlando, Fla., that killed 49 plus the shooter sent shares of gunmakers Smith & Wesson (SWHC) and Sturm Ruger (RGR) sharply higher Monday as Wall Street anticipated higher gun sales spurred by regulatory concerns. Smith & Wesson reported strong earnings and guidance late Thursday. Smith & Wesson stock rose 10.5% this week. Sturm Ruger climbed 5.6%.Meanwhile, airline stocks tumbled, partly on fears that the Orlando attack could deter travel as well as concerns that the U.K. could vote June 23 to exit the European Union.

But Synchrony said Tuesday that it expected to write off slightly more consumer debt as a loss over the next year. A day later, Capital One said it would not change its loss forecast even as its net charge-off rate and delinquencies rose in May. Warnings have increased about rising credit-card and auto-loan debt. Synchrony crashed 16.3% this week, and Capital One 8.35%. American Express (AXP) lost 4.8% and Discover Financial Services (DFS) fell 6.2%.

132,TTWO,"The Electronic Entertainment Expo in Los Angeles is expected to be somewhat smaller this year as major video game publishers Activision Blizzard (ATVI) and Electronic Arts (EA) will be absent from the show floor, but that doesn’t mean there won’t be any game-changing announcements.This year’s E3 is focused on the prospect of hardware updates from Sony (SNE) and Microsoft (MSFT) as analysts and industry experts call for a shorter console upgrade cycle.It’s been four years since Sony's PlayStation and Microsoft's Xbox have released new consoles, and the gaming community has sighed at the sluggish pace.But with virtual reality headsets and games now hitting the consumer market, it could be time for a refresh since powerful consoles are needed to handle the complex virtual reality graphics.""We view this event as a directional positive change to transform the traditional (roughly) 5-year console upgrade cycle to a more small-steps/iterative series akin to what PC and mobile hardware see currently,"" said Credit Suisse analyst Stephen Ju in a June 9 report.Ju says the result ""may be a decreased incentive for the consumer to wait for new hardware as well as alleviated development gyrations for the publishers,"" and calls that a ""win-win.""Sony launches its PlayStation VR gear this fall for $399, and a report from the Wall Street Journal in late March said the company has plans to unveil a new console ahead of the headset’s release.E3, with a show floor open Tuesday through Thursday and press conferences several days prior, is an ideal venue for such an announcement and has been the selected location for big-name product debuts in years past.Speculation also has surfaced that Sony rival Microsoft will unveil new Xbox hardware at the show. The HoloLens, Microsoft’s augmented reality headset, is still in the developer stage. But Xbox currently partners with Facebook (FB)-owned Oculus VR, with its Xbox One controller included with a $599 Rift purchase.Some analysts have even asserted an expansion on an Xbox-Oculus partnership, since Oculus currently does not have its own console and requires expensive PCs to run its games.Adding to the tone of the event is the absence of major video game publishers Electronic Arts and Activision Blizzard from the show floor. EA will be holding its own separate event that's open to the public, dubbed ""EA Play,"" at a nearby venue.According to Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter, the decision has a ripple effect.""EA's move to its own space a block away from E3 will benefit EA but will hurt the industry, and we fear that if EA's choice creates a template that others follow, E3 will suffer mightily in future years,"" Pachter said in a June 6 report.He's ""less critical"" of Activision's decision. It has opted to relocate its floor presence to the PlayStation booth, with its ""Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare"" among the games to be displayed. Activision on Thursday announced the September launch of ""Destiny: Rise of Iron.""The third major publicly traded video game publisher, Take-Two Interactive (TTWO), will have a booth at the show.E3 is typically a trade and media-only event, but in late May the Entertainment Software Association announced the debut of ""E3 Live,"" which will be a public event held at the same time as E3. It's also at the same location as EA Play.With significant announcements, the event could be a catalyst for a number of stocks. EA, Activision, Take-Two are all currently trading 5% or less below their recent highs.Sony broke out of a cup-with-handle base with a 28.21 buy point on Monday, but fell below that level Friday. It lost 2.6% to 28.03 in the stock market today.Microsoft is finding support at its 200-day line, but its recent attempts to retake the 50-day line were met with resistance. Shares are trading 8% below their late December high and ticked down 0.3% to 51.48.Facebook has been trading sideways for more than a month, but it's still holding within buy range from a cup-with-handle base cleared in April after the social media giant's earnings report.

134,TTWO,"The E3 gaming expo is in Los Angeles next week and IBD will be covering the show.On the surface, E3 may seem like an event that only concerns gamers, but investors have reasons to be interested.The consumer adoption of virtual reality gear is ramping up, and some notable publicly traded tech companies are involved in this space: Sony (SNE) with its PlayStation VR and Facebook (FB) with its Oculus Rift.There could be announcements related to the gear surrounding next week’s event.Speculation has already risen about such an announcement from Sony. Reports in late March said that Sony has plans to release a new console to accommodate its PlayStation VR headset, which will launch this fall.Rumors have also surfaced that rival Microsoft (MSFT) will unveil new Xbox hardware at the show. Microsoft’s HoloLens is an Augmented Reality device in the developer stage. But Xbox is currently partners with Facebook's Oculus, with its controller included with Rift purchases.Meanwhile, Alphabet (GOOGL)-owned Google is also developing products for the VR space, but its Cardboard uses a smartphone, not a video game console.Sony fell 1.4% in the stock market today while Microsoft dipped 0.8%. Alphabet dipped 0.1% while Facebook edged up 0.1%.And big-name video game publishers Electronic Arts (EA), Take-Two Interactive (TTWO) and Activision (ATVI) will be thrust into the spotlight, though not all of them will be present on E3’s show floor. Still, any information or announcements about new games could impact their stocks.EA is trading near its all-time high set in Tuesday’s session, but fell 3 cents to 76.25 Thursday, as it continues to struggle to break out of a consolidation.Take-Two is also hovering near a recent high, falling 0.2% Thursday. The stock recently broke out of a flat base and is still trading in buy range.And Activision is extended from a breakout past a cup-with-handle base. Shares are trading slightly below their high set earlier this month, climbing 1.1% Thursday as Activision unveiled a new game in its ""Destiny"" franchise.

135,TTWO,"Video game publisher Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO) posted better-than-expected fiscal-fourth-quarter earnings late Wednesday, as older game titles continued to drive sales.Take-Two earned 46 cents a share excluding items on sales of $377 million in the quarter ended March 31. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had expected the New York-based company to earn 26 cents a share on sales of $306 million. On a year-over-year basis, earnings per share fell 6%, and sales fell 12%. The company faced tough comparisons to the year-earlier quarter, when ""Evolve"" was released.Take-Two's fiscal Q4 earnings were bolstered by older titles like ""Grand Theft Auto 5,"" which first launched in September 2013; ""NBA 2K16,"" released last September; and ""WWE 2K16,"" released in October. The company's ""Grand Theft Auto Online"" service also posted strong results. New game ""XCOM 2"" contributed to sales as well.Take-Two stock rose 4.5%, to 37.29, on the stock market today. Its shares hit a record high of 38.52 on April 4.Two other big game publishers also are trading near all-time highs, but fell Thursday. Activision Blizzard (ATVI) stock fell 1.7% to 37.80. Activision hit a record high of 39.93 on Dec. 29. And Electronic Arts (EA) stock fell 1.3%, to 73.50. Shares scored a record high of 77.15 on Monday.Take-Two’s guidance for the current fiscal year, however, disappointed, as the company will not release an anticipated sequel to its “Red Dead” Western game this year.At the midpoint of its guidance, Take-Two expects to earn $1.13 a share on sales of $1.55 billion in fiscal 2017. Analysts were modeling $1.91 and $1.76 billion, respectively.Take-Two’s game slate includes the release this month of “Battleborn”; “NBA 2K17” in September; and “Mafia 3,” Civilization 6” and “WWE 2K17” in October.Piper Jaffray analyst Michael Olson reiterated his overweight rating on Take-Two stock with a price target of 40.“While fiscal 2017 guidance is below consensus, most investors will likely give Take-Two a pass on the outlook, given it does not include a new version of 'Red Dead,' and management is hinting that fiscal 2018 will be a year of strong growth,” Olson said.In a statement, Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick said the company’s Rockstar Games studio is “hard at work on some exciting future projects that will be revealed soon.” Rockstar is the studio behind the ""Red Dead"" and ""Grand Theft Auto"" franchises.Take-Two noted that “Grand Theft Auto 5” to date has sold 65 million units, up 5 million in the last quarter.The lack of a Rockstar game this year leaves Take-Two stock without a major catalyst, said Pacific Crest Securities analyst Evan Wilson. Fiscal 2017 will be the second consecutive year without a Rockstar game, he said in a research note. Wilson rates Take-Two stock as sector weight.Baird analyst Colin Sebastian maintained his neutral rating on Take-Two stock but cut his price target to 37 from 38.Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter reiterated his neutral rating on Take-Two but raised his price target to 32 from 30.50.“We continue to be impressed by Take-Two’s ability to consistently deliver upside to both its guidance and consensus expectations,” Pachter said in a report. “Grand Theft Auto 5’s phenomenal catalog sales and the ongoing robust performance of Grand Theft Auto Online position the company to deliver profits for the foreseeable future; however, we remain unwilling to recommend Take-Two shares until we have greater visibility into its long-term release pipeline.”RELATED:EA Scores Positive Reviews From Investor Day; Stock Gets PT HikeActivision Blizzard Ready To Rack Up Points From E-SportsDisney’s Exit From Toys-To-Life Video Games Could Boost Activision.

136,TTWO,"Video game publisher Electronic Arts (EA) on Tuesday laid out its plan to add $1 billion in incremental revenue within the next three to five years.EA earned mostly positive reviews for its presentation at the company's investor day event, held at its headquarters in Redwood City, Calif.Oppenheimer analyst Andrew Uerkwitz reiterated his outperform rating on EA stock but raised his price target to 88 from 78. EA stock fell 0.9% to 74.49 on the stock market today. Electronic Arts shares hit an all-time high of 77.15 on Monday.“We came away more confident in EA’s growth strategy and ability to engage existing and potential customers with new tools,” Uerkwitz said in a research report Wednesday. “We believe secular tailwinds such as the move to digital and mobile will support multiyear margin expansion and profit growth for the company.”EA sees future sales growth coming from action games, shooter games and international expansion. It projects that digital growth, including sales of full-game downloads and extra content spending, will boost profitability.Another area of growth is e-sports. EA says competitive gaming initiatives will drive game sales, plus deliver advertising and sponsorship revenue.The next potential catalyst for EA is the E3 video game conference in mid-June, Piper Jaffray analyst Michael Olson said in a note Wednesday. He maintained his overweight rating on EA stock with a price target of 87.EA’s game lineup for its current fiscal 2017 is more attractive than last year’s slate, Olson said. Upcoming releases include “Mirror’s Edge Catalyst,” due out June 7, and “Battlefield 1,” due out Oct. 21. Also in the pipeline are “Titanfall 2,” scheduled for fiscal Q3, and “Mass Effect: Andromeda,” set for late Q4. EA's fiscal 2017 started April 1.EA ended fiscal 2016 with non-GAAP revenue of $4.57 billion, up 6% year over year.

Of more than 4,000 video game respondents, 78% own a current-generation game console or expect to in the next two years, up from 73% in the fall survey.Plus, teen video game spending intentions reached new highs in the survey.Piper analyst Michael Olson, in the investment bank's research report, reiterated his overweight ratings on Activision, EA, Take-Two Interactive and retailer GameStop (GME).Teens in the survey expect to spend, on average, $214 this year on video games, up from an 11-year average of $152.“The rising level of interest and ownership in consoles is a clear positive for the game publishers (ATVI, EA, TTWO) and GameStop (GME) as it speaks to the console cycle’s potential to drive software growth in 2016 and 2017,” Olson said in the report Tuesday.Male teens surveyed said they allocate 20% of their overall spending on food, 15% on clothing, and 13% on video games.“Amazingly, video games ranks higher than cars (10%) and electronics (9%),” Olson said. “We believe this is yet another sign that video game consoles are not losing mindshare and, in fact, may be more popular than ever.”Current-generation game consoles include Microsoft’s (MSFT) Xbox One, Nintendo’s (NTDOY) Wii U and Sony’s (SNE) PlayStation 4.Olson anticipates strong spending on video games in the next 12 months, driven by an uptick in the overall quality and quantity of major games.

Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had expected Take-Two to earn 50 cents a share ex items on sales of $452.8 million.

He upped his price target to 135 from 123 and reiterated his buy rating.""The solid beat during a slow quarter underscores how EA is becoming more predictable and profitable with its event-driven live services model,"" such as Ultimate Team, he said in a report.EA's upcoming game ""Star Wars Battlefront 2"" is its most important launch this year, he said. It is set for release on Nov. 17.""If this game is a hit, it could drive meaningful upside to (earnings),"" O'Shea said. ""EA says the game could sell 14 million units in Year One, and this seems achievable. … But the more important question is whether the player base will be deeply engaged.

Shares are 4.6% below a buy point at 156.75. Investors will be looking to hear an update from Apple on the upcoming iPhone due out this fall, which has seen production delays.Universal Display (OLED) makes OLED screens, and Apple has plans for an OLED version of its upcoming phone. Universal Display is forming a cup base, with shares 7% below a 130.75 buy point.Match Group (MTCH) is 3.7% below a cup-with-handle entry ahead of its results. Match's buy point is at 19.28 as a handle has formed above the 50-day line. Match Group runs dating sites Match.com and Tinder.

155,TTWO,"Video game publisher Electronic Arts (EA) late Thursday disappointed investors with its sales forecast for the September quarter and full fiscal year, which came in below Wall Street's targets.EA guided to sales of $955 million in the current quarter and $5.075 billion this fiscal year. Analysts were looking for the company to generate sales of $1.18 billion in the September quarter and $5.19 billion for the year.In its fiscal first quarter ended June 30, EA posted earnings per share of $2.06, up 47% year over year, on revenue of $1.45 billion, up 14%.Analysts track the company's results on a non-GAAP basis, which EA no longer reports, making comparisons difficult.In a note to clients, Baird analyst Colin Sebastian said EA's June-quarter sales were in line with expectations, but its non-GAAP earnings of 31 cents a share were above the consensus target of 27 cents.IBD'S TAKE: Which companies are reaching new 52-week highs this week? Head to IBD Stock Lists for a peek.In the June quarter, 61% of revenue came from digital sources, such as game downloads and online services, while the rest came from traditional sales of packaged games at retail.Shares were down 3.8% in after-hours trading on the stock market today.

158,TTWO,"Alex Naffziger estimates that he has spent as much as $400 on character costumes and other digital tchotchkes while playing a video game that costs $60 at retail — Activision Blizzard's (ATVI) 2016 ""Overwatch.""With gamers like him spending freely to outfit characters with new ""skins,"" in-game purchases are booming and digital content now generates more revenue for Activision than physical games do.""They had a lot of cool skins, and I wanted to make sure that I got them, so I probably spent a good $150"" during the game's most recent sale, he said while standing in line at Activision's booth during the E3 gaming conference in June.Back in the day, buying a new console game was a one-off transaction. That single shiny disc bought from the local game shop (or cartridge, depending on when you played your first title) contained everything needed to become immersed in a far-off digital realm. Now it could be just the start of a long-term relationship with so much profit potential that game publishers like Activision and Electronic Arts (EA) are transforming their businesses into a ""games as a service"" model that keeps players engaged with a title long after it hits shelves.The video game industry's revenue boom comes despite an aging demographic and niche user base, issues that might set off alarms for investors of other tech firms like Twitter (TWTR) or Snapchat-parent Snap (SNAP).The soaring business in virtual goods via in-game ""microtransactions"" also contrasts with the troubles that have beset other industries shifting to a digital-first mindset (see: retail, entertainment). Gamers, it turns out, are happy to spend money online to extend the life of a game they love.IBD'S TAKE: To find the best stocks to buy, focus on the groups that currently are leading the stock market. The Computer Software-Gaming industry recently ranked No. 2 in price performance among 197 groups tracked by IBD, and Activision was the No. 2 stock in the group. Timing, however, is key. Use IBD Stock Checkup to see how Activision, Electronic Arts, Take-Two Interactive and other game stocks rate.""(There's) clear evidence people are willing to spend vast sums of money when given the opportunity for the right experience,"" Jefferies analyst Timothy O'Shea told Investor's Business Daily.And unlike an actual sword or machine gun, a digital version to arm a game character costs almost nothing to produce.Virtual goods vary from game to game. They can include anything from coins to weapons to trains to horse armor. The practice certainly isn't new to PC gamers or enthusiasts of mobile addictions like ""Candy Crush Saga.""But for gamers who play on consoles like the Sony (SNE) PlayStation and Microsoft (MSFT) Xbox, the concept really only took off three or four years ago, spurring a massive growth-engine for publishers.""The R&D costs are minimal; the economics on that sale are incredible,"" said O'Shea.Creating widgets out of pixels takes very little time. ""Maybe for the developers it's like 30 minutes at lunch,"" he joked. But the profits are serious: Microtransaction margins can be a whopping 85%-90%.On top of that, the add-ons can draw players deeper into a game, making it a ""really, really intriguing model,"" said O'Shea.This model involves cultivating an overarching stream of ""live services,"" of which microtransactions of virtual goods are just a part. It also includes e-sports competitions as well as expansion packs or ""map packs"" that unlock new areas of an existing game — essentially, any content updates provided after a game's initial launch.Game publishers ""don't look at a game as a new release and then it's done; they look at a game as something that consumers want to interact with for years rather than weeks,"" said NPD Group's Mat Piscatella. ""And that's leading to the success that's going on in the market right now.""""GTA Online,"" the web extension of Rockstar Games' ""Grand Theft Auto V,"" has reportedly raked in over half a billion dollars from microtransactions. That's according to a legal complaint filed against Rockstar and parent company Take-Two Interactive (TTWO) by the game's producer and former Rockstar North president, Leslie Benzies.""These purchases have a nearly 100% profit margin, subject only to nominal development costs and app store commissions,"" reads the document.And ""GTA Online"" continues to chug along in popularity, despite being released in 2013 — a lifetime ago in gaming years.""Plenty more content is coming"" for that particular title, said Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick on the company's May earnings call. ""Consumers love it. It remains an enormous focus of everyone's attention.""Piper Jaffray analyst Michael Olson says the ""bigger, better, fewer"" approach has taken hold of video game publishers in the last five years, a safer alternative to trying their luck on untested new titles.""A few weeks ago we set a new (daily active user) record on the back of these new content updates,"" said Blizzard head Michael Morhaime in Activision's Q1 call in May. ""This reflects the evolution of our business from focusing primarily on full game releases to also providing a consistent stream of content for our players. Even without any full game launches this year, we're continuing to add to the depths of our games to serve a very highly engaged community with more content across our portfolio than we ever have before.""In 2016, in-game revenue made up $3.6 billion of Activision Blizzard's $6.6 billion in sales — more than half of the total pie and up 126% from the prior year, notably helped by the takeover of ""Candy Crush Saga"" maker King Digital.And as more people bought entire console titles online and acquired more downloadable content, the overall digital-revenue segment shot up 94% to account for almost three-quarters of total revenue for the year.At Electronic Arts, digital revenue accounted for 61% of the year's nearly $4.9 billion in net sales, as it too embraced the industry's shift.Case in point: the online multiplayer fantasy-soccer mode in EA's popular ""FIFA"" series sells 12-packs of virtual trading cards, which can include coveted star players that gamers can add to their teams. On its own, ""Ultimate Team"" accounted for $832 million in net sales for the year, or about 17% of EA's 2016 revenue.""EA's games today are live services — amazing experiences that we update and evolve to deliver ongoing fun that keeps players engaged, connects them to their friends, brings them more content and grows our network,"" said EA CEO Andrew Wilson on the company's Q4 earnings call in May. ""This strategy has been at the core of our digital transformation, and today our live services are some of the strongest and most vibrant in the industry.""EA management pegged features like virtual cards as one of the key growth drivers for the current fiscal year, alongside its mobile business and ""Star Wars Battlefront II."" Officials touted Ultimate Team as a ""gateway"" to e-sports competitions, another budding revenue stream.""It's like selling airline tickets; some people pay much more to fly first class and many opt for the coach experience,"" Jefferies' O'Shea wrote in a note. ""Applied in the right way, the trading card business model results in larger audiences, deeper engagement  and higher profits.""Still, even as the live-services model takes hold, some gamers complain about microtransactions and the industry's efforts to make them shell out for more content after they've already bought a game. The idea of paying for more powerful weapons or more lives strikes some as unfair.Another common complaint is that the microtransaction model promotes ""pay to win"" instead of ""play to win.""""I'm OK if it's just an extra option,"" said 27-year-old Joseph Vasquez at E3. ""But they've kind of turned it into where, if you want to really unlock a lot of things, unless you're willing to play months-on-end straight, then you're going to want to spend some extra money on top of the $60 you've already spent, which is kind of a cheap tactic — a cheap business tactic, I think.""But such opposition might not rattle the bottom lines of Activision and Electronic Arts.In fact, Wall Street remains bullish on the video game sector.""You don't need huge growth among the player base to drive continued increase in revenue per player,"" according to Piper Jaffray's Mike Olson. He said solid sales of PlayStations, Xboxes and other consoles point to an expanded addressable market that is ""hungry for new technology.""Piper Jaffray's biannual teen survey still shows great interest from Gen Z. So even though the average gamer is older, the overall age range of the video gaming community is actually widening, Olson says. That translates to more, not fewer, revenue opportunities.Underscoring that cross-generational opportunity is 37-year-old Aurelio Rubio and his four kids: two daughters and two sons. Between the five of them, the family currently uses three PS4s, one Xbox One and one Nintendo Switch.Since everyone has his or her own TV and console, Rubio is used to buying several copies of each game — and by extension, several copies of the same expansion packs and other digital content.""For us, it's the way we bond,"" said Rubio, who estimates that he has spent thousands of dollars on video games in his lifetime. ""As a family thing, we bond together. It adds that value.""

159,TTWO,"Stocks closed Friday with modest gains as volume declined. While earnings results sent some leading issues flying higher or crashing lower, the latest jobs report (a 209,000 jump in U.S. payrolls for July, well above expectations) appeared to justify Wall Street's months-long bullish stance.XThe Nasdaq composite added nearly 0.2% for only its second gain in seven sessions. However, at 6351, the premier major U.S. index is keeping an air pocket above the critical 50-day moving average.The Nasdaq also lost just 0.4% for the week after going on a three-week 4% run that began in early July. The tech-heavy index also lies less than 2% below its all-time peak of 6460.The S&P 500 added 0.2% and rose about the same amount for the week, while the Dow Jones industrial average, getting a nice boost from its financial components JPMorgan Chase (JPM) (up 2.6%, just below a 94.08 entry in a 3-1/2-month saucer base pattern), Goldman Sachs (GS) (in saucer building mode) and Visa (V) (in buy range, 4.3% above a 96.70 narrow flat-base entry), advanced 0.3% and closed above the 22,000 level.IBD's TAKE: For new investors who are willing to learn the chart-reading techniques by highly skilled professionals on Wall Street, getting a thorough command of the cup with handle and the flat base is one important step that can be taken by all. Learn the details, market concepts and psychology behind these two bullish chart patterns that help you make money at the best time in the stock market by reading about them as well as other key topics in Investor's Corner.Small caps outperformed. The S&P SmallCap 600 rallied 0.4% while the Russell 2000 gained 0.5%.Volume fell on both exchanges.Despite the solid jobs report, which also showed a 4.3% unemployment rate and a 2.5% year-over-boost in average hourly earnings, some observers stress the importance of an overall rise in inflation, not just wages, in convincing the Federal Reserve to make another hike in short-term interest rates.""This report should move projections (for the fed funds rate to go to a 1.25%-1.5% target range) above the 50% mark, but there needs to be more evidence of higher inflation to get to a 90% chance of one more rate hike,"" Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial, told IBD.Wages also rose 0.3% on a month-to-month basis.Back to equities, Apple (AAPL) rallied 0.5% in quiet trade to 156.39. Shares rallied 4.6% for the week and are just beneath a new breakout point of 156.75. Apple had formed a nearly three-month flat base, then broke out Wednesday following an acceleration in quarterly EPS and revenue growth.In addition to the prospect of further top- and bottom-line growth, two more reasons why Apple shares can continue to flourish:One, Apple's most recent base is just second stage. On Jan. 6-9, the iPhone giant hurdled over a 118.12 entry in a first-stage cup with handle. Early stage bases have a higher chance of succeeding.Two, Apple's valuation may be considered good value on both the growth and value sides of the investment management landscape. In addition to strong fundamentals, Apple continues to pay a healthy dividend (1.6% annualized yield and rising) and buy back shares.The current price-to-earnings ratio for Apple is 18, and just 14.5 times the estimated FY 2018 EPS forecast of $10.76 a share (up 20% from FY 2017), according to William O'Neil + Co. Apple is expected to earn $8.97 a share in fiscal 2017 (ending in September this year), up 8%.In the just-ended fiscal third quarter, Apple's earnings grew 18% to $1.67 a share. That represented a third quarter in a row of EPS acceleration, following a 15% drop in Q4 2016 (September), a 2% rise in FY Q1 2017 (December) and a 11% hop higher in FY Q2 (March).Revenue rose 7% to $45.4 billion, up from year-over-year changes of -15%, -9%, +3% and +5% in the prior four quarters.The Street sees fiscal Q4 earnings rising 13% to $1.88 a share on a 9% top-line increase to $50.99 billion.Apple's RS Rating, as seen in IBD Stock Checkup, has improved to an 87 vs. a lowly 59 at the start of 2017 on a scale of 1 to 99. Yet, while most smaller companies may break out of fine bases while their Relative Price Strength Rating is 80 or higher, in the case of big cap like Apple, a stock that forms long bases or goes sideways for six to 12 months or longer may show a lower RS Rating and still succeed.The Composite Rating for Apple has brightened to a very respectable 93 on a scale of 1 to 99. This proprietary rating takes into account all of IBD's special ratings plus the stock's recent price action. (Notice on the Stock Checkup how the Checkup doctor is not grinning, but not frowning either. But as for the SMR Rating, Apple's A grade puts a smile on the Checkup doctor's face.)The SMR rating stands for Sales + Profit Margins + Return on equity. In general, growth investors should focus only on those companies with a return on equity of 17% or higher.Other big winners for the week included Grubhub (GRUB) (a top play in online food ordering services, now up 15% since its July 12 debut on Leaderboard), Stamps.com (STMP) and video game software developer Take-Two Interactive (TTWO), featured in IBD's new special Stocks Near A Buy Zone feature on Monday.RELATED:When Did Apple Recently Show A Follow-On Entry?What Is A Bottoming Base, And How It Helped Investors Make Money In AppleWhy Did These 4 Companies In IBD 50 Plunge?The Latest In Investor's CornerStrong Large-Cap Growth Firms: Peer Inside IBD Big Cap 20The Newest Additions To IBD LeaderboardHow To Prepare For The Next Major Market Top: First, Learn IBD's Simple Method

But the stock rose 6.55%, clearing its 50-day moving average.Here's What Analysts Like And Don't Like About Tesla EarningsBefore Ordering A Tesla Model 3 Or Chevy Bolt, Look At This ChartApplied Optoelectronics sees weak revenue for the current quarter, shocker given that the optical stock had raised or beaten guidance several times this year. It cited some slower demand from a large customer, which could be Amazon. Applied Opto, the No. 1 stock in the No. 1-rated Telecom-Fiber Optics group, crashed 34% Friday. Acacia Communications (ACIA) and Infinera (INFN) also had bad news late Thursday. Earlier in the week, Macom Technology Solutions Holdings (MTSI), an optical-related chipmaker, sees weak China demand.

Meanwhile, ISM surveys signaled still-strong manufacturing growth while some decelerating growth in the service sector.Grubhub (GRUB) and Yelp (Yelp) both topped second-quarter earnings and revenue estimates late Thursday. As part of a long-term partnership, Grubhub will pay $287.5 million in cash to acquire Yelp's online food ordering and delivery business, Eat24.

Aetna (AET) and Humana (HUM), which will both complete their exit from the individual insurance markets at year end, both sailed past earnings estimates thanks to momentum in their Medicare Advantage businesses, and their shares vaulted to record highs. Aetna earnings ballooned by 55% and Humana earnings grew 6%, both smashing views. Cigna (CI) and WellCare Health Plans (WCG) also reported strong earnings. But Molina Healthcare (MOH), which saw the exchanges as a big growth opportunity, reported a loss of $4.10 a share in Q2, largely blaming its ObamaCare exchange business.

Facebook's fellow FANG stock Amazon.com (AMZN) is on tap Thursday evening, with Amazon shares currently in buy range. Electronic Arts (EA), Baidu (BIDU) and Mastercard (MA) also are in buy zones with earnings set for Thursday.XAmazon, Electronic Arts and Mastercard all have stellar Composite Ratings of 95 or above, while Baidu's is a solid 83. But three of the four stocks have already moved into the upper half of their 5% chase zones, with Amazon's chart offering additional reasons to be wary.S&P 500 index futures rose 0.15% vs. fair value. Nasdaq 100 futures were up 0.55%, with Facebook trading 4% higher in the after-hours session. PayPal (PYPL) and Lam Research (LRCX) also contributed with after-hours earnings gains.

But those won't be included in Q2's results.IBD'S TAKE: Buying or holding a stock can be risky heading into an earnings report. Here's an earnings options strategy that can help you cash in on post-earnings stock gains, while minimizing the risk from a weak quarter. That options strategy is highlighted in IBD's weekly Earnings Preview column.Amazon rose 1.2% to 1,052.80 in Wednesday stock market trading. That's above a 1,016.60 flat-base buy point. The 5% chase zone rises to 1,067.43, so Amazon is still buyable. However, it's always better to buy as close to the entry point as possible to minimize the potential losses. Amazon is 3.6% above the entry as of Wednesday, and was trading at 1,061.50 in premarket trading.Meanwhile, Amazon cleared a fourth-stage base. Late-stage patterns are more prone to failure. Also, Amazon's breakout came on lackluster volume.On the upside, Amazon's relative strength line is at new highs, a bullish sign and reflecting the stock's outperformance of the S&P 500.Amazon has a 98 Composite Rating, which means it outperforms 98% of all stocks based on a variety of fundamental criteria. Big stock winners often have 95+ Composite Ratings near the start of their big runs.The Chinese search giant has struggled in recent quarters, especially in comparison to many other Chinese internet giants. Baidu is making a big throw on autonomous driving and artificial intelligence. In the meantime, analysts expect Baidu to report Q2 EPS of $1.42, up 16%, on revenue of $2.78 billion, up 1%.Baidu climbed 2.1% to 201.17 on Wednesday. The stock was still within buy range from a cup base at a 193.84 entry, though it's nearly 4% above that point. You could also view Baidu as being within a pattern going back into 2016, but the buy point would remain the same.Baidu has the opposite problem of Amazon. Baidu is in a first-stage base, but because the stock has largely gone sideways over the past year, its relative strength line is lagging.Electronic Arts is expected to report EPS of 28 cents, up 300% vs. a year earlier. Revenue should climb 12% to $766 million.The video game publisher's stock broke out on Wednesday, rising 3.8% to 118, clearing a 116.14 flat-base buy point with volume that was 41% above normal. Electronic Arts has a 95 Composite Rating and a strong RS line.Activision Blizzard (ATVI) is at new-high ground, while Take-Two Interactive (TTWO) cleared an entry point on Tuesday.Mastercard reports before the market open. Analysts expect an 8% EPS gain to $1.04 with revenue up 10.5% to $2.978 billion.Mastercard rose 0.8% to 130.99, its 14th straight gain, mostly in small doses. The stock cleared a flat-base entry of 126.29 on July 14 and is now 3.7% above that level. Mastercard has had a few above-average-volume days in its breakout move, but not many.Visa (V) and American Express (AXP), which reported earnings last week, are in the upper end of buy ranges. PayPal, which topped views late Wednesday, and Square (SQ), are among the other recent stock breakouts in the finance-payment group, though they are both extended.RELATED:Facebook Earnings Soar; Users Hit New Milestone4 Big Earnings You Can't Miss Thursday: Investing Action PlanVideo Game, Chip Stocks Climb To New Buy PointsHere's What Analysts Are Saying About Amazon Ahead Of Earnings

170,TTWO,"Activision Blizzard won the holiday season in video game sales with its hit title ""Call of Duty: Black Ops 3,"" while specialty retailer GameStop was a loser because of e-commerce and digital downloads, according to Pacific Crest Securities.""With the success of 'Call of Duty: Black Ops 3,' we believe Activision (ATVI) was the big winner this holiday season,"" Pacific Crest analyst Evan Wilson said in a report Monday. ""Our checks have consistently mentioned 'CoD' as the top game this holiday season and that sales are up year over year due to the first three-year development cycle for Black Ops and the return of the ever-popular Zombies mode. We remain positive on ATVI headed into 2016.""A Veteran Hot Seller""Black Ops 3,"" the latest in Activision's long-running military combat series, is likely to exceed expectations, Wilson said. He rates Activision stock overweight, with a price target of 41.Activision stock rose 0.56, or more than 1%, to end at 39.58 in Tuesday's trading. Volume was dull, ending more than 40% below its 50-day average.Earlier in the session, shares hit an all-time high for the fourth time in the past 15 trading days, at 39.93. Activision stock has nearly doubled in 2015.Meanwhile, GameStop (GME) continues to be hammered by the consumer shift to buying games as digital downloads rather than as packaged media, Wilson said.He rates GameStop stock as sector weight.""GameStop's business model is being seriously challenged, and we would stay away from it in the near- to midterm,"" Wilson said.GameStop stock ended virtually flat Tuesday, down 0.04 to 28.43. Shares are down 15% this year.Wilson is neutral on game publishers Electronic Arts (EA) and Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO), rating both stocks as sector weight.EA's ""Star Wars Battlefront"" generated significant buzz this holiday season, but sales were largely driven by retailer discounts, he said.""We continue to think sales are only around the 13 million unit guidance,"" Wilson said. ""There was much talk of 'Battlefront's' potential, and it clearly missed a much bigger opportunity.""Many customers seem to have purchased the game right away or when the game was on sale for an extended period of time. We did not get much evidence of a reacceleration in purchases after the movie release. We would stay on the sidelines as shares look for a next catalyst beyond Star Wars.""Take-Two had a ""relatively successful holiday,"" thanks to strong sales of its pro basketball game ""NBA 2K16,"" he said.Activision scores a 96 Composite Rating out of a maximum 99.

172,TTWO,"GameStop (GME) sneezed and gave the video game sector a cold on Monday. GameStop shares fell 4.2% to 37.61 after the video game retailer reported fiscal third-quarter results that missed Wall Street's targets and gave Q4 guidance below views.Game publishers Electronic Arts (EA) and Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO) fell on GameStop's report. EA dropped 4.8%, to 68.98, and Take-Two dipped 1.9%, to 34.91, on the stock market today. Rival publisher Activision Blizzard (ATVI) slipped a fraction, to 37.35.EA stock was down the hardest because GameStop executives said initial sales of EA's ""Star Wars Battlefront"" game were below expectations and that digital game downloads likely were not to blame for the shortfall. Some Wall Street analysts, however, said digital downloads probably were the reason.Sales of the Star Wars game should pick up as the Dec. 18 premiere of the Walt Disney (DIS) movie ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" approaches, GameStop Chief Operating Officer Tony Bartel said on a conference call with analysts.""So while Star Wars is off to a bit of a slow start, we do think that it is going to rally very strong, as we get to closer to the movie,"" he said.GameStop also said Microsoft's (MSFT) ""Halo 5: Guardians"" and Ubisoft's ""Assassin's Creed Syndicate"" fell short of expectations during the period.'Duty, 'Fallout' Meet ViewsOn the bright side, the recent launches of Activision's ""Call of Duty: Black Ops 3"" and Bethesda's ""Fallout 4"" have met initial expectations, Bartel said.GameStop Chief Financial Officer Rob Lloyd told IBD that typical AAA game releases nowadays see about 20% of unit sales from digital downloads. GameStop is not seeing a major shift in that percentage, he said.Most gamers still prefer physical game discs because of the resale value and not wanting to fill up the hard-disk drives on their game consoles, Lloyd said.Cowen analyst Doug Creutz disagrees with GameStop executives and sees an acceleration in digital downloadsg.""GameStop suggested on their call that three of the five big holiday games are underperforming expectations (Star Wars, Halo 5, Assassin's Creed) and that the other two are in line (Call of Duty, Fallout 4),"" Creutz said in a research report Monday. ""It seems unlikely to us that what amounts to a buyers strike is really going on amid the most powerful hardware cycle on record.""We suspect that the average underperformance vs. their expectations is really being driven by an acceleration of digital downloads.""Piper Jaffray analyst Michael Olson maintained his overweight rating on GameStop stock, but cut his price target to 43 from 57.GameStop ""is clearly seeing some impact from increasing digital software sales, but we would expect digital expansion to ease in the holiday quarter,"" Olson said in a report Monday.In the quarter ended Oct. 31, GameStop's sales fell 3.6% year over year to $2.02 billion. Earnings per share dropped 5.3% to 54 cents. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected GameStop to earn 58 cents a share on sales of $2.14 billion.For the holiday sales quarter, GameStop expects to earn $2.22 a share, based on the midpoint of guidance, vs. analyst expectations for $2.37 a share.Follow Patrick Seitz on Twitter @IBD_PSeitz and on Facebook.

173,TTWO,"""Star Wars Battlefront,"" the much-anticipated video game from Electronic Arts (EA), appears to have found its dark side: mediocre reviews. The game, released Tuesday, has earned an early score of 73 out of 100 on Metacritic, based on 13 critics using a version of the game for Microsoft's (MSFT) Xbox One console. That falls in the range of ""mixed or average reviews,"" Metacritic said. The version of the game for Sony's (SNE) PlayStation 4 earned a score of 78, which equates to ""generally favorable reviews,"" based on reports from 11 critics.Critics praised ""Star Wars Battlefront"" for its visuals and cinematic quality, but knocked it for limited gameplay and lack of options. The game rides a wave of enthusiasm ahead of Walt Disney 's (DIS) holiday movie ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens,"" a sequel to the classic science-fiction trilogy.Mizuho Securities analyst Neil Doshi said the initial reviews for ""Battlefront"" are ""disappointing,"" but the game likely still will sell 13 million units in the company's fiscal 2016, which ends March 31.""In our view, the game should be a holiday hit, boosted by the upcoming theatrical release of 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens' on Dec. 14,"" Doshi said in a research note Tuesday.""Reading user reviews, many of the lowest scores were from people who expected a single player campaign,"" he said. ""There were also some complaints regarding a lack of content, which we believe the company will address with upcoming DLC (downloadable content).""Also, major gaming sites like IGN and Game Informer have yet to post their reviews, Doshi said.Doshi reiterated his buy rating on EA stock, with a price target of 84.EA stock was up 1%, near 69, in midday trading on the stock market today.Piper Jaffray analyst Michael Olson said ""Star Wars Battlefront"" is a game that can ""rise above"" reviews because of enthusiasm for the ""Star Wars"" franchise.""Early reviews agree the game looks good, but suggest the dearth of overall content limits replay,"" Olson said.Olson rates EA stock as overweight, with a price target of 87.The major game publishers are benefiting from the sweet spot in the console upgrade cycle.

174,TTWO,"Video game publishers Activision Blizzard (ATVI) and Electronic Arts (EA) are ""well positioned this holiday"" with hot game titles and because there will be less competition this year, an analyst said Wednesday.XAfter attending the first day of the E3 convention in Los Angeles on Tuesday, Timothy O'Shea of Jefferies came away more confident about prospects for Activision and EA during the fourth quarter, according to his note to clients.The most important holiday game releases include ""Destiny 2"" and ""Call of Duty: WWII"" from Activision, along with ""Star Wars Battlefront 2"" from EA and ""Assassin's Creed Origins"" from France-based Ubisoft.Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO) recently moved its highly anticipated ""Red Dead Redemption 2"" to spring 2018 from this fall. And privately held Bethesda Softworks won't provide much competition this holiday season either, O'Shea said.""Heading into E3, it was unclear whether Bethesda planned to release a game this holiday,"" O'Shea's note said. ""Remember at E3 2015, Bethesda announced a major title, 'Fallout 4,' a huge game that eventually played spoiler to several competitive games that holiday. But this year Bethesda has nothing on the order of 'Fallout 4,' and this absolutely reinforces the view that ATVI and EA will have strong holidays.""Activision's ""Call of Duty: WWII"" is attracting the most attention at the show, which runs through Thursday.""In conversations with gamers (and) developers around the expo, the buzz around the 'Call of Duty: WWII' gameplay was overwhelmingly positive,"" Baird analyst Colin Sebastian said in a report Wednesday. "" 'Destiny 2' feedback (was) more mixed, although a marked improvement from the original.""IBD'S TAKE: For the latest news on the E3 conference, check out IBD's E3 news page. E3, short for Electronic Entertainment Expo, runs Tuesday through Thursday in downtown Los Angeles.Piper Jaffray analyst Michael Olson said gamers at the show appeared most excited to play ""Call of Duty: WWII"" and ""Star Wars Battlefront 2.""Key themes among publishers at the show include digital sales growth and e-sports.Publishers get higher profit margins for direct sales of digital downloads of full games and for add-on content. E-sports, or competitive video gaming, is an emerging area with opportunities for advertising, sponsorships and other revenue.Activision gained nearly 1% to close at 58.45 on the stock market today.

""If that is the case, we expect Project Scorpio to underwhelm at retail, as has PS4 Pro, which costs $399.""NPD Group analyst Mat Piscatella said Microsoft's Project Scorpio is what he's most interested in hearing about at E3. He wants to get details on pricing, software support and services at the show, he said in a report.Nintendo's (NTDOY) Switch console has gotten off to a brisk start since its supply-constrained launch on March 3. But to keep the momentum going it will need to announce a rich game software slate at E3, Pachter said.Big upcoming releases for Nintendo Switch include ""Super Mario Odyssey"" and ""Splatoon 2,"" both of which will be highlighted at E3, Pachter said.Virtual-reality gaming will be a popular topic at E3 again, with Sony expected to announce multiple new games for its PlayStation VR headset, Pachter said. Sony announced Monday that it has sold over 1 million units of PlayStation VR.Another hot topic will be e-sports, or professional video game tournaments.

All have buy ratings or the equivalent on the stock, except for Baird and CFRA, which rate it as neutral and hold, based on valuation.Analysts shrugged off Take-Two's announcement that it is postponing the release of its Western shooter game ""Red Dead Redemption 2"" until spring 2018 from this fall.""We do not view such a delay negatively, especially with recurring revenue continuing to roll in from 'Grand Theft Auto Online' and 'NBA 2K,' as the company is known to sacrifice release dates for the sake of quality,"" BMO analyst Gerrick Johnson said in a report.IBD'S TAKE: The IBD 50 list of top-performing growth stocks includes two video game firms: Activision Blizzard and NetEase.Take-Two's fiscal 2019, which will start on April 1, 2018, is shaping up to be a record year, with the launch of ""Red Dead Redemption 2"" and a major unannounced title, likely ""Borderlands 3,"" Johnson said.The focus at Take-Two has shifted from big game releases to long-term recurring revenue from major game properties through downloadable content and online services.Video game publishers like Take-Two, Activision Blizzard (ATVI) and Electronic Arts (EA) have been benefiting from the shift to higher-margin digital downloads and away from sales of packaged media.RELATED:Take-Two's Strong Sales, Earnings Ease Pain Of 'Red Dead' Delay

""I do think the VR market, as exciting as it is for me - general consumers haven't been into it too much. So, Sony was out there early, and their stuff is mostly good but there are some issues. It kind of makes sense for Microsoft to take a step back and make sure they get it right for the living room, so I'm not going to read too much into this yet. And the VR market is still growing.""But, he added, the hefty price point will pose a problem for Microsoft this holiday season.Watch the video for the interview, and for more E3 2017 coverage and details on Activision Blizzard (ATVI), Take-Two Interactive (TTWO) , Facebook (FB) and others, head to IBD's E3 news hub or check out our live-streamed videos on Facebook.

Its stock surged to a record high on the news.New York, N.Y.-based Take-Two earned 89 cents a share, up 85% year over year, on sales of $572 million, up 52%, in its fiscal Q4 ended March 31.The biggest contributors in the quarter were ""Grand Theft Auto 5"" and ""Grand Theft Auto Online,"" ""Mafia 3,"" ""NBA 2K17,"" ""Sid Meier's Civilization 6"" and ""WWE 2K17.""On a non-GAAP basis, Take-Two earned 67 cents a share on sales of $407 million in the March quarter, vs. analyst expectations of 57 cents and $355 million.Take-Two shares soared to a record high of 76.70 in morning trading on the stock market today.

Big game releases later this year include Activision's ""Destiny 2"" (Sept. 8) and ""Call of Duty: WWII"" (Nov. 3) and EA's ""Star Wars: Battlefront 2"" (Nov. 17).Activision Blizzard stock was up 1%, near 57.70, in morning trading Tuesday.

Before that, IWM rose 10% from a flat-base breakout in November.The fund, launched in May 2000, has attracted $36.6 billion in assets.

Twitch is the market leader in the segment with about 10 million daily active users. Alphabet's (GOOGL) YouTube is another big player in the e-sports streaming space.Finally, Microsoft is best positioned among the console makers to become a major player in e-sports, Wingren said.

344,TTWO,"Video game publishers are starting to benefit from the console upgrade cycle hitting the sweet spot and the shift to digital distribution, investment bank Jefferies said Wednesday.Jefferies analyst Brian Pitz said he is broadly positive on the video game sector following the annual E3 trade show last week in Los Angeles.Pitz on Wednesday upgraded his ratings on game publishers Electronic Arts (EA) and Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO) to buy from hold. He also has a buy rating on Activision Blizzard (ATVI).Pitz sees ""two powerful, multiyear tailwinds"" for the sector: faster-than-expected sales of next-generation consoles and the transition to digital distribution and other digital revenue streams.He expects the installed base of the latest consoles, specifically Sony's (SNE) PlayStation 4 and Microsoft's (MSFT) Xbox One, to reach 48 million to 49 million by the end of 2015, two years after they launched. By comparison, it took the previous generation consoles, Sony's PS3 and Microsoft's Xbox 360, 3.5 years to hit the same milestone of roughly 50 million consoles sold, he said.The installed base of current consoles could approach 100 million units by year-end 2017, he said.Another positive for game publishers is the move to digital revenue. Publishers get higher profit margins on games sold as downloads than ones sold as packaged media in retail stores.""Today, around 15%-20% of new games are digitally downloaded, up from low single digits two years ago, and up to 40% of catalog titles are downloaded,"" Pitz said. ""We expect the percentage of downloads to continue to rise, and the objections (large file sizes, can't resell a download, some people don't have credit cards) will be resolved over time. This is a very positive trend for publishers given gross margin for digital downloads can be 10 to 20 percentage points higher than retail copies of the same game.""Looking at specific publishers, Pitz said EA's multiyear game pipeline is ""the best we've ever seen (from the company), starting this holiday with 'Star Wars Battlefront.'""He raised his price target on EA stock to 80 from 58. EA stock was up 1.6%, near 68, in afternoon trading on the stock market today.Pitz upped his price target on Take-Two to 35 from 29. Take-Two stock was up more than 2%, near 29, in afternoon trading Wednesday.Pitz has a price target of 26 on Activision.

348,TTWO,"The S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite hit record highs on Thursday, completing a quick recovery from the May 17 market plunge as FANG stocks Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) led the way. Oil prices, which had been steadily rising ahead of OPEC's key meeting, tumbled after the cartel extended production cuts. Meanwhile, Best Buy (BBY) and Ulta Beauty (ULTA) were among the few retailers to defy the sector sell-off with strong earnings and share gains. Ford (F) ousted its CEO amid woes for the auto sector.The S&P 500 rose 1.4% and the Nasdaq 2.1%, both hitting record highs. The Dow advanced 1.3% Amazon (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) rose strongly to new highs, with Amazon and Alphabet nearly hitting the 1,000 price level. Oil prices retreated after OPEC extended but didn't deepen production curbs, leaving intact a status quo that encourages shale producers. Best Buy (BBY) and Ulta Beauty (ULTA) soared to record highs as they prove to be Amazon-resilient, while Lowe's (LOW) and Tiffany (TIF) struggled. Red-hot Chinese social media and live-streaming video app Momo (MOMO) cooled off despite crushing views.At its meeting Thursday, OPEC extended production cuts through March 2018 but didn't deepen output curbs as some had speculated, while keeping Libya and Nigeria exempt for the foreseeable future even as their output rises. Oil prices tumbled 4.8% that day, wiping out gains made in the weeks leading up to the meeting. On Wednesday, EIA data showed U.S. oil inventories fell for the seventh consecutive week, while production rebounded from its first dip in three months. After a Friday rebound, U.S. crude futures closed the week down 1.8% to $49.80 a barrel.Ulta Beauty (ULTA) posted a beat-and-raise Q1 that surpassed expectations, sending shares jumping to an all-time high Friday. The specialty beauty retailer's same-store sales growth of 14.3% defied conventional wisdom about traditional sellers and beat consensus for 11% comps. Profit rose 32% to $1.91 a share on 22.5% revenue growth to $1.31 billion. E-commerce sales popped 70.9%.Costco (COST) beat on both the top and bottom lines as same-store sales rose 5%, sending shares upward Friday morning. The membership warehouse is upping its annual fee next week. Dollar Tree (DLTR) fell short of views by a penny with 98 cents EPS and met sales forecasts for $5.29 billion. Comps edged up 0.5%. Outlook for Q2 was light. Burlington Stores (BURL) EPS beat by 9 cents though sales of $1.35 billion were just a hair short of estimates. The midpoint of full-year profit guidance exceeded current estimates. Burlington's shares rose Thursday but erased those gains Friday.Consumer electronics retailer Best Buy (BBY) and video game vendor GameStop (GME) each reported April quarter results that beat views. But while Best Buy guided Wall Street higher for the current quarter, GameStop gave an in-line outlook. Best Buy stock soared to a record high, while GameStop sank below its 50-day moving average.The China-based social media and live-video streaming app on Tuesday reported adjusted first-quarter earnings that skyrocketed 630% vs. a year a year ago, with revenue rising 421% to $265.2 million. Those were well above estimates. But Momo (MOMO), which had reversed lower from a record high on Monday, kept falling, losing 10% as of Friday afternoon, though it did find support at its 50-day line.Video game publisher Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO) galloped 14% to a record high stock price after delivering better-than-expected March-quarter results. Investors shrugged off the news that Take-Two is delaying its highly anticipated Wild West shooter game ""Red Dead Redemption 2"" to spring 2018 from this fall. The focus at Take-Two has shifted from big game releases to long-term recurring revenue from major game properties like ""Grand Theft Auto Online"" and ""NBA 2K"" through downloadable content and online services.Ford (F) dumped Mark Fields after the stock and earnings had fallen sharply, lagging peers. New CEO Jim Hackett, who had run Ford's autonomous driving unit, is seen as a turnaround specialist. Meanwhile, the Justice Department sued Fiat Chrysler (FCAU), accused it of cheating on emission tests on many diesel pickup trucks. General Motors faced a new private lawsuit for allegedly installed software 'defeat devices' for various diesels as well. The diesel emissions saga took off in 2015, when Volkswagen (VLKAY) came under scrutiny.Toll Bros. (TOL) topped fiscal second-quarter earnings estimates, helped by demand for ""affordable"" luxury homes. But shares of Toll and other builders retreated as U.S. new-home sales for April fell to a level well below expectations. Existing-home sales also sank more than expected. Home-improvement retailer Lowe's (LOW) Q1 results missed.Investors punished suppliers of automotive replacement parts for big earnings misses. AutoZone (AZO) gapped down 12% Tuesday to its lowest level in more than two years. Advance Auto Parts (AAP) sank nearly 5% Tuesday, then fell 5% Wednesday after its own miss. O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY), which tumbled below its 50-day line after its April 27 earnings report, fell 1.1% for the week, well off weekly lows. Their weak results and stock performances come as Amazon (AMZN) reportedly mulls breaking into the auto parts market.Adjusted profit per share advanced 47% while revenue grew 32% to $157.9 million, both comfortably topping Wall Street estimates. The cloud-based software maker for the life sciences industry also gave guidance above the Wall Street consensus. Veeva (VEEV) shares jumped 8.2% to a new record high Friday.Dycom said its adjusted Q3 earnings were $1.30 a share, up 20% from a year earlier, with revenue rising 18% to $786.3 million for the period ended April 29. Both topped views. But the telecom installer forecast EPS in a range of $1.35 to $1.50 and revenue in a range of $789 million to $810 million vs. consensus estimates of $1.79 and $849.4 million. Dycom shares plunged more than 22% for the week.Upscale jeweler Tiffany (TIF) reported better-than-expected Q1 earnings Wednesday, but revenue fell short and same-store sales unexpectedly declined. Signet Jewelers (SIG), parent of mall-based Kay Jewelers, Zales, and Jared The Galleria of Jewelry, missed on earnings. Shares of both retailers tumbled.NetApp (NTAP) topped earnings and sales views, but gave weak guidance. Shares, which fell late Wednesday, rallied 3.5% in Thursday's regular session, retaking its 50-day line. But NetApp gave up some of those gains Friday.Splunk (SPLK) reported a smaller-than-expected Q1 adjusted per-share loss while revenue topped views, but shares fell 7% Friday, dropping back below a buy point. The data analytics firm gave in-line guidance.

350,TTWO,"Even though Apple (AAPL) has shown no appetite for making large acquisitions, Wall Street analysts continue to speculate that the iPhone maker will use its massive cash stockpile to make a game-changing deal.Investment bank Citigroup is the latest to weigh in on what Apple might do with its war chest, which totaled $256.8 billion in cash and marketable securities as of April 1. Of that amount, 93% is outside the U.S.Citi analyst Jim Suva says internet television network Netflix (NFLX) is the most likely target for Apple if it decides to make a big acquisition. He puts 40% odds on a Netflix buyout, according to media reports citing the firm's note to clients Friday titled ""Addressing the Problem of Too Much Cash.""Any major deal would be contingent on U.S. corporate tax reform, specifically a better rate for repatriating foreign profits. Citi thinks a 10% repatriation tax on foreign cash would entice Apple to make a big M&A deal.Another possible acquisition target is entertainment conglomerate Walt Disney (DIS), Suva says. He puts the odds of Apple buying Disney at 25%.Other companies that Apple might have an interest in buying include luxury electric car maker Tesla (TSLA), streaming video service Hulu, and video game publishers Activision Blizzard (ATVI), Electronic Arts (EA) and Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO). He put their odds of being acquired by Apple at 10% or less.IBD'S TAKE: Apple is on IBD's Leaderboard list of actionable stocks with the potential for big gains.A Netflix acquisition would make the most sense for Apple, Suva said.""Netflix is global, has no noncore assets (like Disney) and is disrupting the global video ecosystem,"" Suva said. ""Apple could help accelerate this disruption. That is, since Apple is very cash generative, it could help Netflix accelerate — and deepen — its push into original content.""Netflix has a market capitalization of $67.5 billion. Apple's largest acquisition to date was its $3 billion purchase of headphone maker Beats Electronics and its fledgling streaming music service in 2014.In an interview with CNBC on Tuesday, Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook said his company wants to be a player in online video.""The video world has kind of hit an air pocket,"" Cook said. ""Where cord-cutting has been happening on some kind of basis, we think it's accelerating massively and that it's clear what the end story looks like here. The trajectory is a debate. But we'd like to play in this.""To date, Apple's focus in the streaming video market has been on selling third-party services like Netflix, Hulu and Time Warner's (TWX) HBO through its App Store and taking a fee for managing payments. Recode reported Friday that Apple is nearing a deal to offer Amazon.com's (AMZN) Amazon Prime Video service through its Apple TV set-top box, possibly by the third quarter.Apple also is funding some original video content for its Apple Music service. That content will include shows like ""Carpool Karaoke.""Apple stock rose 1.7% to 148.96 on the stock market today.

It's slated to arrive this spring. The available games are Xbox One and Xbox 360 titles from Microsoft, Take-Two Interactive (TTWO), Warner Bros.

GameStop has a Composite Rating of just 19. For a look at top-performing stocks, check out IBD'S Tech Leaders.GameStop has had a rough couple of years, hurt mainly by the shift to digital game downloads and away from packaged media.In response, GameStop has diversified its business from video games to mobile devices and pop-culture collectibles.In addition to GameStop stores, it also runs shops that sell AT&T (T) and Apple (AAPL) products.GameStop in mid-January reported that its same-store sales plummeted nearly 19% during the nine-week holiday period through December.

410,TTWO,"George Soros took stakes in Facebook (FB) and Dow component Goldman Sachs (GS) in the fourth quarter, while Appaloosa cut its stake in Apple (AAPL), and both followed Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BKRB) in appearing to find a bargain in airlines. Here's a look at how some big investors managed their portfolios in the last quarter of last year.Soros Fund Management bought 353,686 shares in Facebook and bulked up its stake in Alphabet (GOOGL) by nearly 60% to 20,200 shares, according to a regulatory filing out late Tuesday. Soros also increased his T-Mobile (TMUS) stake to 685,700 shares.Soros bought 62,100 shares in Goldman Sachs. Dan Loeb's Third Point last week disclosed that it had scooped up shares of Goldman, Bank of America (BAC) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM).Bank stocks have risen on greater expectations of lighter regulations, higher interest rates and greater volatility, which Goldman's trading desk could benefit from in particular.Soros also took a 40,000-share stake in Delta Air Lines (DAL), but dropped United Airlines (UAL).Shares of Apple ended regular trading up 0.4% to 135.51 on the stock market today, after hitting a record high yesterday. Facebook fell 0.3% to 133.44, while Goldman Sachs rose 0.4% to 250.54. Delta climbed 2.6% to 51.17, American rose 2.1% to 47.54, and United gained 2.7% to 75.75.IBD'S TAKE: Even as big investors flocked to the airlines last year, Cowen analysts last month said shares of airlines could be ""due for a break"" after taking off in Q4. Meanwhile, Soros dropped Activision Blizzard (ATVI), Herbalife (HLF), Harley Davidson (HOG), PepsiCo (PEP) and JCPenney (JCP). He also dissolved his stake in Nordstrom (JWN)Soros also offloaded his position in consumer-care products giant Procter & Gamble (PG), which got a lift Tuesday after activist investor Trian took a more than $3 billion stake in the company.Hedge fund Appaloosa Management increased its stake in Facebook by 47% to 2.2 million shares. The fund also upped its holdings in Qualcomm (QCOM) and more than doubled its stake in Southwest (LUV). Appaloosa also took a 160,000-share stake in United Airlines.The fund loaded up on the health sector, taking new stakes in companies like Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY), Centene (CNC), McKesson (MCK) and Pfizer (PFE). It also took a new stake in JCPenney.Appaloosa cut its position in Apple by 350,000 shares, slashed its stake in Yahoo (YHOO) and rid itself of Bank of America and General Motors (GM).Along with boosting its stake in Apple, David Einhorn's Greenlight Capital dissolved its stake in Take-Two Interactive (TTWO), U.S. Steel (X) and Michael Kors (KORS).Like Buffett, Greenlight also took a stake in Monsanto (MON).But the moves by Soros and Appaloosa into airlines are notable in that they could signal other big investors are following Buffett, who announced Q3 stakes in the sector last year.Buffett, after years of avoiding the airlines, has come around to the industry. Airlines last year showed more signs of discipline, and the wave of consolidation over the past several years has kept the major airlines relatively insulated from new competition.""When we launched on the sector late last year, we found most investors generally in agreement that airlines represented deep value,"" Barclays analyst Brandon Oglenski wrote in a research note dated Tuesday.""The biggest question remains: when will the market and, more importantly, large long-term investors begin to care? We think tonight's Berkshire Hathaway 13F will go a long way to attract sector interest.""RELATED:Airline Stocks Tumble On Fears Capacity May Creep Back UpDelta, American, United Go Guns Blazing Into Battle Of The AtlanticJPMorgan Sets Fresh High, Goldman Hits Highest Since 2007 On Yellen

412,TTWO,"LAS VEGAS – Wearable fitness tracker maker Fitbit (FIT) is looking to get people exercising more using financial incentives and gameplay, Fitbit CEO James Park told IBD at CES 2017, the annual consumer electronics show.Fitbit has accomplished a lot by providing users of its devices with automated words of encouragement and vibrations for reaching activity goals, such as 10,000 daily steps. But now it is looking for ways to get people moving by providing tangible benefits.For instance, Fitbit is participating in a wellness program offered by UnitedHealth (UNH) that gives members up to $4 a day in rewards for meeting activity goals.Participants can earn up to $1,500 a year in Health Savings Account (HSA) or Health Reimbursement Account (HRA) credits. And employers can obtain premium savings based on participants' combined results.IBD'S TAKE: CES is the tech industry's biggest show by far in the U.S., providing a start-of-the-year way to gauge what's ahead on the tech front, and IBD, as always, was there with print and video coverage of CES 2017.Fitbit is offering a customized Fitbit Charge 2 wristband for UnitedHealthcare Motion program participants.The Motion program ""is the first insurance company initiative … where people are being paid money for physical activity,"" Park said Friday. ""That's a big step forward.""The program marks a ""pivotal moment in the health care insurance industry,"" Park said. ""We anticipate that other insurers will look at the details of this partnership and announcement to figure out what their play is.""In November, Fitbit announced a partnership with Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO) involving its ""NBA 2K17"" basketball video game. Players who achieve 10,000 steps in a day tracked with their Fitbit device will receive a temporary attribute boost to their MyPlayer in ""NBA 2K17,"" enhancing their character's performance in the game.Park said he hopes to see more Fitbit partnerships with game companies in the future.Providing incentives is a good way to prod people to be more active, Park said.""Fitness and health a lot of times is really tedious for people and so there's a lot of different motivations – gamification is one, incentives are another, support of the community is a third,"" he said.Among the software updates Fitbit announced for its devices at CES is a Community feature. That feature allows users to share more activity accomplishments on Facebook (FB) and Instagram and connect with friends and groups for added support and inspiration.Fitbit stock was down 1.4% to close at 7.79 on the stock market today, and amid ever tougher competition it's been trading below 10 for two months.RELATED:Winners And Losers From CES 2017: Nvidia, Amazon, Apple, Qualcomm

414,TTWO,"After stumbling with its poor-selling Wii U video game console, Nintendo (NTDOY) is hoping for a comeback with its upcoming Switch console.Nintendo late Thursday detailed pricing and availability for the device, which can function as a living-room console player or a portable gaming machine. The Nintendo Switch will cost $299.99 and be available March 3.Nintendo stock fell Friday on the news because the device is more expensive than expected. Many analysts expected the Switch to retail for $200 to $250. Also, some game industry pundits have cast doubt on its prospects.Nintendo's U.S. shares tumbled 6.3% to 25.85 on the stock market today.IBD'S TAKE: Nintendo stock ranks ninth out of 15 companies in IBD's Computer Software-Gaming industry group. The No. 1 company is Chinese online games company NetEase. For more information on NetEase, visit the IBD Stock Checkup.Nintendo is a distant third to Sony's (SNE) PlayStation 4 and Microsoft's (MSFT) Xbox One in the current generation of video game consoles, but it is hoping for better luck this go-round. Nintendo sold 13 million Wii U consoles, compared with 53 million units so far for Sony's market-leading PS4 console.SuperData Research analyst Joost van Dreunen told GamesIndustry.biz that he questions whether the Nintendo Switch will have broad appeal.""I have my reservations with regards to the breadth of the audience it targets,"" he said. ""The Switch will likely be most popular among a younger audience: Its functionality is uniquely geared toward pre-teens and teenagers.""The Switch can convert from a living room system into a mobile game device. It features controllers that snap to the sides of a 6.2-inch tablet display in one gameplay mode and can be removed and played wirelessly in another mode. People also can use traditional batwing-style controllers with the console.Graphics chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) is providing a custom Tegra processor for the Nintendo Switch.Nintendo announced several major first-party titles for the Switch, including ""The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild,"" ""Super Mario Odyssey,"" ""Mario Kart 8 Deluxe"" and ""Splatoon 2.""It said third-party game publishers such as Activision Blizzard (ATVI), Electronic Arts (EA), Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO) and Ubisoft will support the new console.RELATED:Nintendo Unveils Versatile Video Game Console: Nintendo Switch

455,TTWO,"Video game publisher Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO) has a bright outlook for 2017, especially with the release of western action game ""Red Dead Redemption 2,"" investment bank Cowen said Monday.Cowen analyst Doug Creutz reiterated his outperform rating on Take-Two stock and raised his price target to 58 from 54. He also elevated the stock to ""best idea"" status for 2017.""Fundamentals for the video game space remain strong and TTWO has the best catalyst path into 2017,"" Creutz said in his research report.Take-Two stock rose 0.5% to 50.03 on the stock market today, nearly 9% extended from a breakout at 45.97 touched on Nov. 3. Take-Two hit an all-time high of 50.56 on Friday.IBD'S TAKE: Take-Two stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 62, meaning it has outperformed 62% of stocks in key metrics over the past 12 months. It ranks No. 3 out of 15 stocks in IBD's Computer Software-Gaming industry group. To see which stocks lead the group, visit the IBD Stock Checkup.""We believe that with fiscal 2017 results largely derisked due to the strong performances of 'NBA 2K17' and 'Mafia 3,' the case for owning the stock ahead of what we expect to be a very successful 'Red Dead Redemption 2' launch in fall 2017, and a significant uptick in fiscal 2018 EPS, is very straightforward,"" Creutz said. ""On average earnings power, Take-Two continues to trade at a discount to peers.""Take-Two's fiscal 2017 ends March 31.Take-Two historically has traded at a discount to rivals Activision Blizzard (ATVI) and Electronic Arts (EA) because of its volatile product release schedule tied to big games.But with the success of the ""NBA 2K"" and WWE series games as well as ""Grand Theft Auto Online"" that has become less of a factor, Creutz said.RELATED:Activision Shot Down By 'Call Of Duty' Sales ConcernsRetailers Heavily Discount Video Games To Drive SalesHoliday Video game Gifts: Wrapped Present Or Digital Download?

456,TTWO,"The kickoff to the holiday shopping season was marked by steep discounts on top-end, or AAA, video-game titles as retailers sought to drive consumer traffic into their stores.""We saw greater discounting of high-profile new video games this Black Friday compared to last year,"" Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter said in a research report Monday.Games that usually maintain their list prices were discounted 40% or more this Black Friday weekend, he said.For instance, Wal-Mart (WMT) was selling ""Battlefield 1"" and ""Titanfall 2"" from Electronic Arts (EA) for $27 each and Microsoft's (MSFT) ""Gears of War 4"" and Take-Two Interactive Software's (TTWO) ""Mafia 3"" for $35 each. Wal-Mart also offered Activision Blizzard's (ATVI) ""Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare, Legacy Edition"" for $57, a $23 discount. Standard editions of those games have a list price of $59.99.During Black Friday last year, top-flight games like Activision Blizzard's ""Call of Duty: Black Ops 3,"" Bethesda Softworks' ""Fallout 4"" and EA's ""Star Wars Battlefront"" maintained their list prices, at $60 each.IBD'S TAKE: Take-Two Interactive Software, Activision Blizzard and Electronic Arts are ranked third, fourth and fifth, respectively, in IBD's Computer Software-Gaming industry group. To see which company leads the group, visit the IBD Stock Checkup.Meanwhile, game hardware discounts for Microsoft's Xbox One and Sony's (SNE) PlayStation 4 consoles was similar to those seen a year ago, Pachter said.A plethora of big game software and new game consoles has given consumers pause, he said.""A combination of desirable new hardware and new software all hitting the market largely within a month appears to have caused hesitation among consumers about how to allocate their spending, with that hesitation increasing further following the emergence of compelling Black Friday ads earlier this month,"" Pachter said.New midcycle consoles include Microsoft's Xbox One S and Sony's PlayStation 4 Pro and PS4 Slim.Many of the game discounts were likely retail ""loss leaders,"" designed to get shoppers into stores, Cowen analyst Doug Creutz said in a report Monday.The only new games not seeing big discounts were ""Pokemon Sun"" and ""Pokemon Moon"" from Nintendo (NTDOY), he said.Game software sales have become more difficult for analysts to track lately since a growing percentage are digital downloads direct from the publishers.Benchmark analyst Mike Hickey on Monday reiterated his sell rating on GameStop (GME) stock and lowered his price target to 20.11 from 20.67. He believes the retailer will be hit hard by the shift to digital downloads.Hickey said he is ""largely unimpressed"" by GameStop's diversification strategy, moving more into sales of mobile phones and pop-culture collectibles.Shares of Take-Two and EA were both down a fraction in afternoon trading in the stock market today, while Activision stock was up a fraction. GameStop stock, though, finished the trading day down 2.6% to 25.15 and facing a test at its 50-day line.RELATED:GameStop Jumps On Q3 Earnings Beat, Diversification StrategyHoliday Video-Game Gifts: Wrapped Present Or Digital Download?

457,TTWO,"The video-game industry is at a crossroads this holiday season as consumers must decide in what form they want to purchase new game software.Will they buy packaged game software so their kids will have something to open on Christmas morning? Or will they buy game software as digital downloads?How consumers respond will impact the top and bottom lines for game publishers and retailers.The biggest game publishers such as Activision Blizzard (ATVI), Electronic Arts (EA) and Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO) lately have been benefiting from the move to digital downloads, which carry fatter profit margins.IBD'S TAKE: IBD Swing Trader uses CAN SLIM technical and fundamental research to find potential hits, not home runs. The goal is 10% profit within five to 10 days, with losses cut at 3%. Take-Two has been a Swing Trader stock of late.Retailers like GameStop (GME) and Best Buy (BBY) have been hurt by the shift to digital game distribution. But they might be able to compensate for that this holiday season thanks to the availability of new midcycle game consoles and the launch of virtual-reality headsets.""Nothing is better under the Christmas tree than a box to open that has an actual gift,"" NPD analyst Mat Piscatella told IBD.Piscatella said he's seen no data yet to indicate that digital game download rates will be higher this holiday season. Video-game publishers have said top titles can sell 30% of units as digital downloads now. But what percentage is gifted is not known, Piscatella said.Many of those downloads probably are purchased by adult gamers who just want to play a new game right away, without having to get a physical game disc, he said.But game downloads have some disadvantages, such as having to wait for a huge digital file to download and install.""You get it on Christmas Day and hopefully you're playing by New Year's,"" joked DFC Intelligence analyst David Cole.Publishers are offering special editions of games with collectibles and other extras to entice gamers to buy physical copies.At the same time, publishers are incentivizing gamers to get digital downloads by bundling in online season passes and pre-release game play.GameStop has been a canary in the coal mine for changes in the industry. On Tuesday, it reported disappointing fiscal third-quarter sales due in part to the increase in game software downloads.GameStop said new game titles sold below expectations for its fiscal Q3 ended Oct. 29. Analysts say Activision's ""Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare"" was among the games that came up short in physical game sales at GameStop last quarter.On the plus side, GameStop said the Nov. 18 release of Nintendo's (NTDOY) ""Pokemon Sun and Moon"" was the retailer's biggest game launch of the year. Nintendo games tend to have a lower digital download rate than those from other publishers. Nintendo customers tend to be younger.Other major game releases this fall include ""Battlefield 1"" and ""Titanfall 2"" from Electronic Arts and ""Mafia 3"" from Take-Two Interactive Software.Annual sports titles are likely to be big sellers this holiday season, including EA's ""Madden NFL 17"" and ""FIFA 17"" and Take-Two's ""NBA 2K17"" and ""WWE 2K17.""Other games looking to rack up big sales this Christmas include ""Watch Dogs 2"" from Ubisoft, ""Dishonored 2"" from Bethesda Softworks, and ""Final Fantasy 15"" from Square Enix.Publishers are cashing in on the sweet spot of the current game console cycle, where there's a large installed base of consoles in which to sell big game titles.Sony (SNE) is expected to have an installed base of 50 million PlayStation 4 consoles worldwide by year's end, DFC Intelligence said. Rival Microsoft (MSFT) is seen having 28 million Xbox One consoles in use by the end of 2016, DFC said.Game hardware revenue has been in decline this year because of market saturation and lower prices for consoles. Sony and Microsoft are hoping to change that with the recent launch of redesigned and souped-up versions of current consoles. Microsoft has the Xbox One S and Sony has the PlayStation 4 Pro and PS4 Slim. Plus, Nintendo has a retro console in its NES Classic Edition, which comes preinstalled with 30 games.Next year will bring two next-generation consoles: the Nintendo Switch and Microsoft Scorpio.This is the first Christmas season for virtual-reality headsets, including the games-focused Sony PlayStation VR. Other VR headsets include Facebook's (FB) Oculus Rift and HTC's Vive. Plus, there are low-cost VR headsets that use smartphone screens as their display, such as the Samsung Gear VR.Among the big VR games already out are ""Batman: Arkham VR"" from Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment, a unit of Time Warner (TWX), and ""NBA 2KVR Experience"" from Take-Two. Electronic Arts is releasing its ""Star Wars Battlefront Rogue One: X-Wing VR Mission"" on Dec. 6.""PS VR launch bundles being sold out pretty much everywhere is a positive sign"" for adoption of virtual reality, Piscatella said. ""There's a lot of excitement around (gaming) hardware and accessories this holiday.""But this could be just a get-to-know-you period for VR. Best Buy, GameStop and others are offering demonstrations of VR systems in their stores to acquaint shoppers with the technology.""Consumers haven't really been introduced to it yet,"" Cole told IBD. ""2017 is the year that VR really gets started.""Best Buy rolled out virtual-reality products to all of its stores during its fiscal third quarter ended Oct. 29, and it has dedicated virtual-reality departments in more than 700 stores, CEO Hubert Joly told analysts on a conference call Nov. 17.Best Buy has given more than 300,000 virtual-reality demonstrations to customers so far, Joly said.And GameStop Chief Operating Officer Tony Bartel said the new gaming hardware products are ""bright spots"" for GameStop.""We're seeing strong demand for new consoles, the PS4 Pro is off to a strong start and VR is generally on the shelves for less than 10 days,"" he said on a conference call with analysts. ""We're also seeing solid consumer interest for the upcoming launch of Switch from Nintendo.""The Switch uses physical media and Nintendo products have historically had a low digital download rate, so we expect this to be a console that drives strong sales of physical product along with the console.""Activision stock fell a fraction to 37.22 in the stock market today, a half-day session that ended at 1 p.m. ET. Shares touched an all-time high of 45.55 on Oct. 25, but also hit a four-month low of 36.32 on Wednesday.EA stock also fell a fraction Friday, to 79.17.

458,TTWO,"Wearable fitness device maker Fitbit (FIT) earned a cautious upgrade from Pacific Crest Securities on Wednesday based on its low valuation.Pacific Crest analyst Brad Erickson raised his rating on Fitbit to sector weight, or neutral, from underweight, or sell. He continues to view fair value for Fitbit stock around 8. Fitbit fell 1% to 9.46 on the stock market today.""While our views of maturity for wearables driving headwinds to growth remain, the stock now more fully reflects the skepticism we expressed in our Sept. 29 downgrade to underweight,"" Erickson said in his research report. ""Fitbit faces increasingly stiffening headwinds to growth, driven by a lack of utility and poor user trends.""IBD'S TAKE: Fitbit stock has a lowly IBD Composite Rating of 9, meaning it has been outperformed by 91% of stocks in key metrics over the past 12 months. For a list of better investment opportunities, check out the IBD 50 list of superior stocks.For Fitbit to regain its footing, it will need to show continued consumer demand for its devices and traction for corporate health care initiatives, Erickson said.He expects Fitbit unit sales growth to decelerate to the high single-digits in 2016 and then decline by 6.7% in 2017.""We think fitness trackers are hitting saturation in developed markets, with opportunities in emerging geographies appearing much more limited, at least for Fitbit-like price points,"" Erickson said.Fitbit needs to compete more with Garmin (GRMN) and others in the sports watch category, Erickson said.""The main opportunity where Fitbit could improve meaningfully in 2017 is in running watches,"" he said. ""Fitbit needs to crack into the specialty channel, not to necessarily drive volume, but to drive consumer street credit as more than a tracker.""Fitbit shares tumbled after the San Francisco-based company on Nov. 2 posted disappointing third-quarter results and badly missed Wall Street's targets for the December quarter.On Wednesday, video game publisher Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO) announced that it has partnered with Fitbit to give players of ""NBA 2K17"" in-game rewards for healthy activity tracked by Fitbit devices.Players who achieve 10,000 steps in a day tracked with their Fitbit device will receive a temporary attribute boost to their MyPlayer in ""NBA 2K17,"" enhancing their in-game performance on the court.It's not the first tie-up between a wearables maker and a video game company.In September, Apple (AAPL) announced that it would bring ""Pokemon Go"" to the Apple Watch. The popular augmented reality game from Niantic has encouraged players to be more active by going for walks to look for and hatch digital creatures in the game.RELATED:Wireless Headphones, 4K TVs, Drones Top Christmas Wish ListsTake-Two Jumps To New High On Slam-Dunk Q2 Earnings

459,TTWO,"Here is your Investing Action Plan for Friday: What you need to know as an investor for the coming day.JCPenney (JCP) reports third-quarter results, following results from Macy's (M), Kohl's (KSS) and Nordstrom (JWN) on Thursday. Weekly rig-count data is due out from Baker Hughes (BHI).Meanwhile, several top stocks are trying to break out or hold buy points amid significant sector rotation following Tuesday's presidential election.Microsoft (MSFT) closed down 2.4% at 58.70 dipping below buy range from a 58.80 flat-base entry in August but still performing better than some of the other big tech players. Microsoft fell as low as 57.63 intraday Thursday, below its pivot point and its 50-day moving average.Papa John's (PZZA) fell 0.6% to 81.27 as its morning breakout attempt met resistance. Shares hit 83.10 intraday, briefly clearing an 82.64 buy point of a flat base begun in September.Data-security software provider Proofpoint (PFPT) also is trying to break out. It rose to 82.96 early then reversed to end down 0.7% at 79.01.Proofpoint has formed a cup-with-handle base with a 79.88 buy point.Take-Two Interactive (TTWO) gapped 4.2% lower to 46.97, still just above a 46.88 buy point. The stock broke out last week following the video-game developer's earnings report.Analysts expect the department-store giant to post a per-share loss of 21 cents, an improvement from the 47-cent per-share loss seen a year ago. Overall sales are seen rising 2% to $2.951 billion.Shares bolted 5.4% higher in the stock market today, but found resistance intraday at their 50-day and 200-day averages. Those key support lines crisscrossed over the past year and did so again this week.JCPenney's results will come as shopping-mall mainstays like Sears (SHLD) and Macy's close stores and cut jobs amid a migration to e-commerce. JCPenney hasn't been immune to that trend, but it has tried to put more effort toward better customer service and new items on its shelves as its rivals struggle.Before Thursday's market open, Macy's reported weaker-than-expected earnings while Kohl's topped views. After the market close, Nordstrom reported a surprise increase in quarterly earnings and sales that also topped views, while lifting its earnings outlook above consensus as well.Shares surged 6.5% late and pushed Macy's, Kohl's and JCPenney higher after hours too.Baker Hughes will report weekly U.S. rig count data. More rigs have come back online in recent months as oil prices have rebounded from longtime lows earlier this year.

460,TTWO,"Activision Blizzard (ATVI) stock tumbled to a two-month low Friday after the video game publisher gave a holiday sales forecast that undershot Wall Street's expectations.Activision shares fell as much as 5.8% in early trading on the stock market today, and closed down 3.85% to 41.70. Activision stock hit a record high of 45.55 on Oct. 25.Santa Monica, Calif.-based Activision late Thursday reported third-quarter results that beat estimates. It earned 52 cents a share excluding items, topping the consensus estimate of 42 cents. Sales rose 57% to $1.63 billion, above analyst estimates for $1.57 billion.Under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), Activision earned 26 cents a share in Q3, up 53% and beating the estimate of 11 cents EPS.For the December quarter, Activision forecast non-GAAP earnings per share of 74 cents on sales of $2.38 billion. Wall Street was modeling 80 cents and $2.48 billion.IBD'S TAKE: Activision stock has a best-possible IBD Composite Rating of 99. It ranks No. 15 on the IBD 50 list of top-performing stocks.Video game companies Electronic Arts (EA) and Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO) this week both raised their Q4 guidance, though EA's outlook still came in a tad below Wall Street expectations. They both also posted Q3 beats, and their shares popped on the news.Analysts have been expecting a big holiday season for Activision, led by futuristic combat game ""Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare,"" which was released Friday.Activision's below-the-Street guidance ""is likely due to the company factoring in a healthy layer of conservatism around 'Call of Duty',"" Piper Jaffray analyst Michael Olson said in a research report. ""Activision management has historically under-promised and over-delivered, exceeding its original EPS guidance on average by 19% in the past 7 years.""Olson reiterated his overweight rating on Activision stock with a price target of 51.Activision could see ""meaningful upside to estimates as management pursues large new opportunities in e-sports, in-game advertising, and micro-transactions,"" Jefferies analyst Brian Fitzgerald said in a report. ""Advertising is a potential billion-dollar business and is not included in Street estimates.""Fitzgerald rates Activision stock a buy with a price target of 55.At least three brokerages raised their price targets on Activision stock after its Q3 beat: Baird, Cowen and Wedbush.Activision's Q3 results were driven by its deep portfolio of game franchises, which include ""World of Warcraft,"" ""Overwatch,"" and ""Call of Duty,"" Baird analyst Colin Sebastian said in a report.Sebastian upped his price target on Activision to 50 from 46 and maintained his outperform rating.Take-Two shares rose 1 cent to 48.30 Friday while EA dipped 0.4% to 80.22.RELATED:Take-Two Jumps To New High On Slam-Dunk Q2 EarningsElectronic Arts Stock Gets Price-Target Hikes On Upbeat Q2 Report

Activision is on the IBD 50 list of top-ranked stocks.Piper Jaffray analyst Michael Olson on Monday reiterated his overweight rating on Activision stock with a price target of 51.""We see potential upside to revenue and EPS guidance driven by 'World of Warcraft' expansion 'Legion,' 'Overwatch' and other digital revenue sources,"" Olson said in a report.Meanwhile, U.S. shares of Chinese online services firm NetEase (NTES), which distributes Activision Blizzard games in China, rose 1.4% to 267.18 on Monday.

Earnings season slows down but highly rated stocks like Nvidia (NVDA), NetEase (NTES) and Acacia Communications (ACIA) will report, along with Walt Disney (DIS) and department store chains. Also keep an eye on shares of Apple (AAPL) and Facebook (FB).Political scores will finally be settled on Tuesday, when Americans vote. Stock indexes in the U.S. and elsewhere sold off over the past week as poll numbers showed Hillary Clinton's once-comfortable lead over Donald Trump shrinking or even disappearing. The S&P 500 dropped for eight consecutive sessions, marking its longest losing streak since the financial crisis in 2008.Some analysts believe that the possibility of a Trump victory still isn't fully priced into markets, suggesting a further dive if he wins Tuesday night. Results of House and Senate races will also determine how much gridlock the next president could face. But close calls in key battleground states may add another wrinkle, if any recounts delay a final result for the presidential contest.With the market uptrend under pressure and distribution days piling up, growth stocks presenting actionable buying opportunities have been few and far between. But three names — VMWare (VMW), T-Mobile (TMUS) and Take-Two Interactive (TTWO) — are trading in or near buy range.IBD 50 member VMWare, a provider of corporate data center software, jumped past a 77.09 buy point from a flat base after issuing an estimate-beating quarterly report on Oct. 26.

The stock gapped up 9.5% that day and has since pulled back within buy range from a flat base with a 48.21 buy point.Take-Two Interactive on Thursday popped into buy range from a flat base with a 46.88 pivot with a nearly 8% gain, as adjusted EPS surged 50% to top views late Wednesday. The video game publisher is now 3% above the buy point, with a stock's buy range extending 5% past a buy point.Meanwhile, tech giants Facebook and Apple have been trading lower since issuing their quarterly earnings reports.Facebook triggered sell signals after plunging well below its 132.08 and 128.43 buy points. The stock is 9.6% below its all-time high reached Oct. 25. And after breaching its 50-day line, the social media leader is now looking for support at the 200-day line.Apple hit its lowest level since mid-September on Friday after breaking below the 50-day line several sessions prior. With a loss of 4.3% for the week, the iPhone maker's shares are now below a 110.33 buy point initially cleared several weeks ago.RELATED:Facebook, Alphabet Fall Below Recent Buy PointsCloud Deals Drive Top Software Stock To HighsThe graphics chipmaker is expected to post its sixth consecutive quarter of accelerating sales growth when it reports Q3 earnings on Thursday.

Despite the success of ""Finding Dory,"" the quarter lacks the string of blockbusters that fiscal Q3 enjoyed, though home video sales will benefit. The theme parks business will likely see a bounce from the June opening of Disney's Shanghai resort. Still, subscriber losses at ESPN and other cable channels remain a sore point.Comparisons in the current quarter will get more difficult as results come up against year-ago results from the megahit ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens,"" which is unlikely to be topped by the December release of ""Rogue One: A Star Wars Story.""Management's conference call with analysts may also shed some light on Disney's streaming strategy as AT&T's (T) $84.5 billion deal for Time Warner (TWX) is the latest sign of the tech and media sectors converging.RELATED:Hulu Live Service Gets Fox And Disney, Waiting On CBS, NBCU Disney-Netflix Deal?

617,TTWO,"Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO) saw its shares fall Wednesday, despite getting an upbeat report from research firm Benchmark.Benchmark analyst Mike Hickey reiterated his buy rating on the video game publisher and raised his price target to 51.79 from 45.92.Take-Two stock, though, sank 1.6% to 45.36 on the stock market today.

""This decision may cause near-term share price volatility.""Creutz reiterated his outperform rating on Take-Two stock with a price target of 45, but said it is under review. Fundamental business trends remain favorable for the company, he said.Take-Two's valuation should benefit from the ongoing transition to digital sales and related margin expansion, Hickey said.However, the company's game-release slate is still lacking a new title from its Rockstar studio, which has delivered blockbusters like the ""Grand Theft Auto"" and ""Red Dead"" franchises.Take-Two's latest big release is its annual pro basketball game ""NBA 2K17,"" which went on sale on Sept. 20.Upcoming releases from Take-Two include crime saga game ""Mafia 3,"" due out Oct. 7, and wrestling game ""WWE 2K17,"" out Oct. 11.The fall and holiday shopping seasons are expected to be highly competitive for the major video game publishers this year.

623,TTWO,"Shares of Electronic Arts (EA  -  Free Report) rallied to a new 52-week high of $148.74, eventually closing a tad lower at $148.61 on Jul 12. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has a market cap of $44.6 billion.Shares of Electronic Arts have been witnessing an upside, appreciating 41.5% in the year-to-date period compared with the industry’s rally of 25.2%.Electronic Arts is well-positioned to benefit from strength in its digital business and its popular franchises. Notably, digital business contributed 68% to its total revenues of $5.2 billion in fiscal 2018.Additionally, the company has been the primary beneficiary of the ongoing shift from physical to digital versions of video games. Therefore, to cash in on the booming digital games market, EA plans to expand its mobile portfolio by releasing a few more games in the coming months.Moreover, its recent acquisition of Industrial Toys will help it further deepen its roots in the digital games market.EA has a solid lineup for fiscal 2019 with releases such as Battlefield V, Anthem, NBA LIVE 19 and Madden NFL 19.EA to Boost Presence in Digital MarketsAs consumers are increasingly spending more on smartphones and portable devices compared with traditional devices for playing online games, EA is well poised to benefit from this ongoing shift.Moreover, according to Newzoo’s market research data, more than 50% of the revenues will come from mobile games by 2020.EA is expected to derive benefits from a growing mobile games market as it launched The Sims mobile game this March, after the success of Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes and FIFA Mobile. Furthermore, the company’s entry into cloud gaming technology with the buyout of wholly owned subsidiary of Gamefly Inc will help it enrich its presence in digital markets.With more and more people having access to portable games, we believe that EA’s move in this direction will lead to top-line growth.New Titles to Boost GrowthEA’s popularity is primarily driven by its well-known franchises, which will continue to fuel top-line growth. EA SPORTS titles FIFA, Madden NFL, NBA Live, NHL, and UFC, along with Battlefield, Titanfall and Star Wars are some of its biggest franchises.Notably, in the last reported quarter its digital revenues increased 18% to $1.102 billion on Battlefield 1, Ultimate Team and Madden NFL 18 full game downloads. Additionally, management believes that the launch of Battlefield 2 and Anthem in fourth-quarter fiscal 2019 will help it cater to a larger audience and drive long-term growth.Furthermore, EA’s e-sports category is helping the company to grow internationally in regions like China, Korea, the Middle East and more. Notably, e-sports has been gaining popularity since the last few years and is currently worth more than $500 million.Moreover the company’s strong foothold in this category will help it face competition from both Activision (ATVI  -  Free Report) and Take-Two Interactive (TTWO  -  Free Report).Estimate RevisionsEA has a strong earnings surprise history. It beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in the trailing four quarters with an average positive surprise of 26.79%.Over the last 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2019 increased a couple of cents to $5.04, indicating year-over-year growth of 24%.

624,TTWO,"Shares of Activision Blizzard (ATVI  -  Free Report) surged over 3.8% following an announcement that it landed a multi-year deal with Disney (DIS  -  Free Report) that will see its esports Overwatch League broadcast live on both ESPN and ABC during the July postseason and beyond. Now let’s dive into why this deal matters not only for Activision Blizzard but for Disney and the future of live TV as well.The Deal Activision Blizzard and Disney announced on Wednesday that this year’s Overwatch League playoffs, which begin Wednesday night, will be broadcast across ESPN, ESPN2, Disney XD, ABC, and various Disney-owned streaming services through the end of July. The deal also includes Overwatch League Season 2 and will amount to hundreds of hours of live coverage and highlights, some of which will be broadcast in primetime on ESPN.The deal marks the continuation of ESPN’s push into esports, which currently includes podcasts and its own vertical on ESPN.com. “The Overwatch League Grand Finals is by far our most comprehensive television distribution for an esports event over a single weekend: 10 total hours over four networks and three days,” ESPN executive Justin Connolly said in a statement.“This overall collaboration with Disney/ABC, ESPN and Blizzard represents our continued commitment to esports, and we look forward to providing marquee Overwatch League coverage across our television platforms for fans.”Disney secured the deal for an undisclosed amount, and it is worth noting that its TV and streaming contract will not impact existing rights agreements the Overwatch League has with partners such as Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) widely popular Twitch streaming platform.Why It Matters The Overwatch League is set to conclude its inaugural season this summer. The league is a huge step in the right direction for esports, which have been on the rise for years, since it features city-based teams competing in a regular season followed by a postseason. This could prove key to converting non-gamers and sports fans into esports watchers.Activision Blizzard’s league already features 12 teams, spread across the U.S., Europe, and Asia—including Los Angeles, London, and Shanghai. The league also boasts some big name owners, from New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft to Los Angeles Rams and  Denver Nuggets owner Stan Kroenke, with all the groups having paid $20 million per team to reserve franchise spots this season. And there are already rumors that the new teams expected to join next season could pay even more.That might seem rather crazy to people who don’t know much about esports, but the Overwatch League said it would hand out $3.5 million in performance bonuses during the first season, including $1 million during the postseason. On top of that, all the players started on a league minimum salary of $50,000, plus health insurance and retirement plans—which already puts them up with some WNBA and MLS players.Meanwhile, the overall esports economy is expected to total $906 million in 2018, up from $696 million in 2017,according to market research firm Newzoo—with the potential to hit $1.5 billion by 2020.The firm also noted that 77% of this revenue will be generated directly from marketing, sponsorships, and media rights.Intel (INTC  -  Free Report), T-Mobile (TMUS  -  Free Report), and HP (HPQ  -  Free Report) all sponsored Activision Blizzard’s Overwatch League during the first season, which is set to run from last December’s preseason through the All-Star weekend in August.Disney’s push into esports demonstrates just how important live sports are, because even if some don’t see esports as a “real” sport, they are games that have that all-important live aspect. This is why Amazon spent millions to broadcast the NFL again over the next two seasons, and why both Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) and Twitter (TWTR  -  Free Report) have continued their push into live sports in the age of Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report), where advertisers are willing to spend big on anything and everything live.Bottom Line Disney hopes to continue to gobble up more and more content as it aims to launch its own over-the-top streaming service in late 2019, while also bolstering its ESPN streaming offerings. And Disney is not alone, with Amazon’s Twitch currently streaming Take-Two Interactive (TTWO  -  Free Report) and the NBA’s inaugural NBA 2K League season.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

625,TTWO,"On Jul 5, we issued an updated research report on Activision Blizzard (ATVI  -  Free Report).The company, one of the leading developers and publishers of console and online games, has been continuously drawing strength from its well-known franchises and engaging content releases.The content addition makes it more attractive to players, increases its engagement levels and thereby leads to higher in-game purchases.Notably, the company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters and matched the same in the remaining quarter. The company delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 27.98% and came up with a positive earnings surprise of 8.57% in the last reported quarter.Moreover, shares of Activision have gained 34.7% in the past year, outperforming the industry’s 26.3% rally.Popular Franchises Drive Top-Line GrowthActivision’s outperformance is primarily driven by its well-known franchises, which will continue to fuel top-line growth. It currently has eight franchises worth $1 billion. Call of Duty is one of the biggest growth drivers for the company. King Digital’s Candy Crush also continues to contribute significantly to the company’s revenues.Notably, Call of Duty: WWII was the top-selling console video game in 2017 globally. The launch of Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 this October is expected to further driver user engagement.We note that at the end of the last reported quarter, Activision had 51 million Monthly Average Users (MAU), up 7% year over year and 12% sequentially, driven by Call of Duty: WWII, Destiny 2 and Crash Bandicoot. Additionally, the company set a new first-quarter record of $1 billion in-game net bookings across its portfolio of franchises.Improving User Engagement PositiveMoreover, the company is leaving no stone unturned to boost its user experience.Last month, it announced the inclusion of a battle royale (BR) game mode called Blackout in Call of Duty: Black Ops 4. This is not only expected to boost Activision’s competitiveness against its traditional rivals but also Fortnite, a free game played by more than 45 million people worldwide. In September 2017, Epic Games introduced a BR mode for Fortnite on computers and gaming consoles.Additionally, the company is strengthening its presence in the lucrative e-sports market and it also has a strong gaming lineup for the second half of the year.However, the growing craze for Epic Games’ Fortnite is an overhang on Activision as we fear a decline in engagement levels.Also, significant competition from the likes of Electronic Arts (EA  -  Free Report), Take Two Interactive (TTWO  -  Free Report) and Glu Mobile (GLUU  -  Free Report) is a concern.Zacks RankActivision currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

628,TTWO,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. (TTWO  -  Free Report). Shares have added about 4.8% in that time frame.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is TTWO due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Recent EarningsTake Two Interactive Software reported earnings of 77 cents per share for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, which declined13.5% from the year-ago quarter. Adjusted earnings came in at 69 cents per share compared with 83 cents in the year-ago period. The Zacks Consensus Estimate was pegged at 64 cents.The company's net revenues came in at $450.3 million, declining 21.2% from the year-ago period. Underperformance of NBA 2K was a dampener.However, continued increase in digital revenues and strength in games like Grand Theft Auto V, Grand Theft Auto Online, WWE 2K18 and WWE SuperCard, Sid Meier’s Civilization VI, and Dragon City and Monster Legends remain positives.Quarter DetailsNet bookings of $411.4 million increased 1% on a year-over-year basis. Digitally delivered net bookings (81% of total net bookings) grew 11.6% to $380 million, driven by Grand Theft Auto Online, Grand Theft Auto V, NBA 2K18, Sid Meier’s Civilization VI, WWE 2K18 and WWE SuperCard.Bookings from Physical retail and other segments plunged 28% to $78.2 million. Recurrent consumer spending net bookings increased 42% and represented 44% of total net bookings.In the free-to-play games space, Social Point's mobile games Dragon City and Monster Legends contributed meaningfully to net bookings. Social Point is also expected to provide a long-term growth opportunity to the company.Per the company, digital revenues (67% of total revenue) increased 8.1% to $301.4 million while revenues from Physical retailer and other segments (33% of total revenue) were down 49.2% to $148.9 million.Region-wise, revenues from the United States (57% of total revenue) were down13.6% to $255.7 million. International markets revenues (43%) declined 29.4% to $194.6 million.On the basis of platform, revenues from console (81%) dropped 29.4% to $194.6 million. Revenues from PC and other (19%) declined 5.2% to $86.8 million.MarginsTake Two’s gross margin of 58% expanded 1310 basis points (bps) year over year due to a decline in software development costs.Operating expenses grew 19% to $173 million on the back of higher R&D expense and cost associated with Social Point. As a result, income from operations declined 21% year over year to $87.8 million.Operating margin of 19.5% remained flat on a year-over-year basis.Balance SheetAs of Mar 31, 2018, Take Two had $1.42 billion in cash and short-term investments, compared with $1.32 billion as of Dec 31, 2017.The company repurchased 1.51 million shares of its common stock for $154.8 million in fiscal 2018.OutlookFor the first quarter, the company expects net bookings to be in the band of $215–$265 million, driven by Grand Theft Auto Online, Grand Theft Auto V and NBA 2K18 as well as the acquisition of Social Point.  GAAP net revenues are projected in the band of $345–$395 million.The company projects operating expenses to be in the range of $190 million to $200 million, up 12% at mid-point due to higher expenses for R&D and stock compensation. The company projects GAAP income per share in the range of 53–63 cents.For fiscal 2019, net bookings are projected in the band of $2.67–$2.77 billion. The company expects Red Dead Redemption 2 (to launch on Oct 26) and NBA 2K to drive growth. Launch of NBA 2K19 and WWE 2K19 in fall 2018 is expected to boost the top line in the fiscal year.However, lower net booking from Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online will remain a drag.Net bookings from current consumer spending are expected to witness modest increase while digitally-delivered net bookings are projected to increase 15%. The company expects Rockstar Games to contribute 55% of net bookings, followed by 2K with 40% and the rest from Social Point and others.GAAP net revenues are likely to be in the band of $2.50–$2.60 billion. The company now projects earnings per share in the range $1.53-$1.80.The company projects operating expenses to be in the range of $885-$925 million, which reflects an increase of 19% at mid-point, owing to higher marketing, personnel and software development costs.Operating cash flow is reiterated to be around $710 million.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates.

630,TTWO,"Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) just secured the live rights for a small, but very important number of Premier League soccer games starting in the 2019 season. The move is part of a slow, methodical effort by Amazon to build up its live sports offerings, which has long been the last great hope for linear television. And this should strike at least some amount of fear in TV powers and fellow streaming services such as Hulu and Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report).The DealAmazon, which announced the deal just a week before the World Cup, now owns live and “exclusive” rights for 20 Premier League games a season in the UK. The three-year deal will see Amazon Prime live stream the first December midweek round and the festive Bank Holiday round of games. This includes the December 26 or Boxing Day—a national holiday—slate of games that regularly features matchups between a large chunk of the 20-team league. Boxing Day games are highly important in the soccer-obsessed land.The Premier League deal was for an undisclosed amount, but it is hugely important as Sky Sports (SKYAY  -  Free Report) and BT Sport (BT  -  Free Report) have come to dominate Premier League coverage recently. The two cable giants won the rights earlier this year to broadcast nearly all of the remaining Premier League games starting in 2019, reportedly paying a combined $6 billion.UK soccer fans with an Amazon Prime membership will be able to watch all of these games at no extra charge. Amazon’s deal also marks the first time that a full round of Premier League fixtures will be broadcast live in the UK. “Prime Video will be an excellent service on which fans can consume live Premier League football—including for the first time in the UK a full round of matches—and we look forward to working with them from season 2019/20 onwards,” Premier League Executive Chairman Richard Scudamore said in a statement.Why It MattersOn the surface level, the deal will likely encourage tons of people in the UK to sign up for an Amazon Prime subscription during the vitally important holiday shopping period. But let’s go a little deeper.Amazon’s push into one of the most popular sports leagues in the world, for a fun and highly anticipated slate of games, is pretty impressive and will likely frighten streaming and cable companies alike. For the non-soccer fans out there, imagine if a UK-based streaming service bought the exclusive rights to broadcast the NBA’s Christmas Day games, beating out ESPN and TNT  or better still, think about the same situation but with NFL games on Thanksgiving on CBS (CBS  -  Free Report) and Fox (FOXA  -  Free Report).The Premier League deal also follows Amazon’s infiltration into NFL programming. The e-commerce behemoth paid $50 million to broadcast 10 Thursday Night Football games this past season, a deal the two sides renewed for the 2018 and 2019 seasons. Amazon’s push into the NFL, which came on the heels of Twitter’s (TWTR  -  Free Report) Thursday Night Football partnership for the 2016 season, has been pretty well publicized.With that said, its long-term impact on the way we consume lives sports has been somewhat understated. Amazon beat out the likes of Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) and others for its NFL deal. Meanwhile, the company has more quietly built up a strong relationship with the NBA.Amazon now streams the NBA’s growing minor league, known as the G-League, through its widely popular Twitch streaming platform. More recently, the company landed the rights to stream the NBA’s new esports league, which they started in partnership with Take-Two Interactive TTWO.Live sports programming is one of the last remaining reasons that many people still cling to their cable subscriptions. But, if five or ten years from now, sports fans can watch live NFL, NBA, and Premier League games, among others on Prime, Amazon could easily become the cord cutters go-to new home.Furthermore, Amazon Prime now boasts an array of original programming and is expected to spend roughly $5 billion on new original programming this year. Amazon committed $250 million on one new Lord of the Rings series. These moves come as it prepares to do battle with Disney’s (DIS  -  Free Report) over-the-top streaming service that is scheduled to launch in late 2019, as well as Netflix, HBO, and others.Going forward, expect Amazon to continue to bolster its live sports offerings and its original programming to better compete against the likes of Hulu, Google’s (GOOGL  -  Free Report) YoutTube TV, Netflix, Comcast (CMCSA  -  Free Report), and almost anyone else.Live sports, TV shows, and movies, paired with free Amazon shipping, all for Prime’s $12.99 a month or $119 a year price tag, seems like almost too good of a deal. Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

631,TTWO,"Take Two Interactive Software (TTWO  -  Free Report) dropped to the cellar of the Zacks Rank after a disappointing Q4 fiscal 2018 report delivered in mid-May. The maker of video games such as Grand Theft Auto reported earnings of 77 cents per share which declined 13.5% from the year-ago quarter.  The company's net revenues came in at $450.3 million, declining 21.2% from the year-ago period. Underperformance of NBA 2K was a dampener. The EPS was a beat, but the top line was miss. Headed into the report, analysts were already taking down estimates for the company with the current June quarter dropping from $0.54 to $0.49. And the full fiscal year 2019 (began in April) fell from $5.15 to $5.06. But after the company's outlook, estimates have continued their slide for the company's key game franchises and this year's EPS projection is now $4.65. The trend is expected to persist into next year with analysts bringing down fiscal 2020 from $5.77 to $4.83 in the past 60 days. Quarter Details Take-Two Interactive is a leading developer, publisher and marketer of interactive entertainment for consumers around the globe. The company develops and publishes products principally through its two wholly-owned labels Rockstar Games and 2K. Net bookings of $411.4 million increased 1% on a year-over-year basis. Digitally delivered net bookings (81% of total net bookings) grew 11.6% to $380 million, driven by Grand Theft Auto Online, Grand Theft Auto V, NBA 2K18, Sid Meier’s Civilization VI, WWE 2K18 and WWE SuperCard. Bookings from Physical retail and other segments plunged 28% to $78.2 million. Recurrent consumer spending net bookings increased 42% and represented 44% of total net bookings. In the free-to-play games space, Social Point's mobile games Dragon City and Monster Legends contributed meaningfully to net bookings. Social Point is also expected to provide a long-term growth opportunity to the company. Per the company, digital revenues (67% of total revenue) increased 8.1% to $301.4 million while revenues from Physical retailer and other segments (33% of total revenue) were down 49.2% to $148.9 million. Region-wise, revenues from the United States (57% of total revenue) were down 13.6% to $255.7 million. International markets revenues (43%) declined 29.4% to $194.6 million. On the basis of platform, revenues from console (81%) dropped 29.4% to $194.6 million. Revenues from PC and other (19%) declined 5.2% to $86.8 million. Company Outlook For the first quarter, the company expects net bookings to be in the band of $215–$265 million, driven by Grand Theft Auto Online, Grand Theft Auto V and NBA 2K18 as well as the acquisition of Social Point.  GAAP net revenues are projected in the band of $345–$395 million. The company projects operating expenses to be in the range of $190 million to $200 million, up 12% at mid-point due to higher expenses for R&D and stock compensation. The company projects GAAP income per share in the range of 53–63 cents. For fiscal 2019, net bookings are projected in the band of $2.67–$2.77 billion. The company expects Red Dead Redemption 2 (to launch on Oct 26) and NBA 2K to drive growth. Launch of NBA 2K19 and WWE 2K19 in fall 2018 is expected to boost the top line in the fiscal year.   However, lower net booking from Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online will remain a drag. Net bookings from current consumer spending are expected to witness modest increase while digitally-delivered net bookings are projected to increase 15%. The company expects Rockstar Games to contribute 55% of net bookings, followed by 2K with 40% and the rest from Social Point and others. GAAP net revenues are likely to be in the band of $2.50–$2.60 billion. The company now projects earnings per share in the range $1.53-$1.80. The company projects operating expenses to be in the range of $885-$925 million, which reflects an increase of 19% at mid-point, owing to higher marketing, personnel and software development costs. Operating cash flow is expected to be around $710 million. The revenue outlook of $2.72 billion (mid-point) compares to the Street at $2.87 billion and EPS of $4.12 vs. the Street at $4.81. From what I read from Wall Street analysts, the primary motivations for reducing estimates has been the weaker-than-expected bookings projections. Yet several investment banks reiterated their Buy ratings and price targets near $130, including Stifel Nicolaus and Piper Jaffray. Apparently, they still like the projected 41% revenue growth and 67% EPS growth this year. Bottom line for TTWO: As gaming platforms become more competitive and differentiated, it seems that new blockbuster franchises are required to keep sales and profits flowing. Until the estimates stop going down and start going back up for TTWO, it may be best to sit this game out. The Zacks Rank will let you know. Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest Strategies It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

633,TTWO,"The liquidity position is indicative of whether a company’s business is heading in the right direction. Favorable liquidity may help a company see strong business growth, which in turn may drive its price performance. Liquidity is a measure of a company’s capability of meeting its debt obligations by converting its assets into liquid cash and equivalents.However, one should exercise caution before investing in such stocks. While a high liquidity level may imply that the company is meeting its obligations at a faster rate compared to peers, it may also indicate that the company is failing to use its assets efficiently.Hence, one may consider the efficiency level of a company in addition to its liquidity to identify potential winners.Measures to Identify Liquid StocksLiquidity ratios like Current Ratio, Quick Ratio and Cash Ratio are primarily used to identify companies with strong liquidity.Current Ratio: It measures current assets relative to current liabilities. This ratio is used for measuring a company’s potential to meet both short- and long-term debt obligations. Thus, a current ratio – also known as working capital ratio – below 1 indicates that the company has more liabilities than assets. However, a high current ratio does not always indicate that the company is in good financial shape. It may also mean that the company has failed to utilize its assets significantly. Hence, a range of 1 to 3 is considered ideal.Quick Ratio: Unlike current ratio, quick ratio – also called “acid-test ratio"" or ""quick assets ratio"" – indicates a company’s ability to pay short-term obligations. It considers inventory excluding current assets relative to current liabilities. Like the current ratio, a quick ratio of greater than 1 is desirable.Cash Ratio: This is the most conservative ratio among the three, as it takes into account only cash and cash equivalents, and invested funds relative to current liabilities. It measures a company’s ability to pay its current debt obligations using the most liquid of assets. Though a cash ratio higher than 1 may point to sound financials, a high number may indicate inefficiency in using the cash.So, a ratio of greater than 1 is desirable at all times but may not always underline a company’s financial health.Screening ParametersIn order to pick the best of the lot, we have added asset utilization, which is a widely used measure of a company’s efficiency, as one of the screening criteria. Asset utilization is a ratio of total sales over the past 12 months to the last four-quarter average of total assets. Though this ratio varies across industries, companies with a ratio higher than their respective industries can be considered efficient.In order to ensure that these liquid and efficient stocks have solid growth potential, we have added our proprietary Growth Style Score to the screen.Current Ratio, Quick Ratio and Cash Ratio between 1 and 3 (While liquidity ratios of greater than 1 are desirable, significantly high ratios may indicate inefficiency.)Asset utilization greater than industry average (Higher asset utilization than the industry average indicates a company’s efficiency.)Zacks Rank equal to #1 (Only Strong Buy-rated stocks can get through. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.) Growth Style Score less than or equal to B(Back-tested results show that stocks with a Growth Style Score of ‘A’ or ‘B’ when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 handily beat other stocks.)These criteria have narrowed down the universe of over 7,700 stocks to only nine.Here are four of the nine stocks that qualified the screen:Headquartered in Santa Clara, CA, Applied Materials Inc.

634,TTWO,"Many investors look for companies and industries they, or someone they’re close with, understand well and interact with in a tangible way. This is why consumer-facing firms can become investing staples.Yet, on its face, picking stocks just because they are familiar is far from a strong investment strategy. This is where pairing easily understood companies, from top performing industries, with strong fundamentals can prove very useful.Today we will look at three companies in the consumer-facing electronics world with great Zacks Ranks that also fall within highly ranked industries, whose businesses can also be easily explained.Sony Corp (SNE  -  Free Report)This electronics company is a household name around the world and has its hands in everything from cameras and televisions to video games and major motion pictures, as well as behind the scenes technologies such as semiconductors.Sony is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and sports an “A” VGM score. The company calls the “Audio Video Production” industry home, which is currently within the top 13% of the 265 different industries tracked by Zacks.Sony’s “A” grade for Value in our Style Scores system is backed up by its 0.66 P/S ratio, which marks a major discount compared to its industry’s average. The company’s P/B ratio of 1.61 also represents a discount against the “Audio Video Production” average. On top of that, Sony is currently trading below the industry average at 15.60x earnings.The maker of PlayStation also scored a “B” for Growth in our Style Scores system, based in part on our current Zacks Consensus Estimates that call for massive earnings increases.Based on our consensus projections, the company’s full-year earnings per share are set to skyrocket 362.75%. What’s more, Sony revenues are expected to pop 6.71% to touch as high as $74.75 billion. And within the last 60 days, Sony has received two upward estimate revisions for its full year earnings.Sony’s recent history is also something investors might want to consider. The company crushed earnings estimates in its last two quarters, and its shares have surged over 32% this year. Yet, the company currently sits over 10% below its 52-week high. This fact, accompanied by its large growth projections, and strong value metrics, helps make Sony a potentially enticing stock.GoPro, Inc. (GPRO  -  Free Report)The founding father of action cameras has taken its lumps since going public, to say the least.  But over the last three quarters, GoPro has topped earnings expectations and has seen its stock price climb 4.25% since the start of the year. Though GoPro’s small gain is well below the S&P 500 and the “Audio Video Production” average, it represents a trend in the right direction.GoPro is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock, which scored “A” grades for both Growth and Momentum in our Style Scores system. And within the last 60 days, GoPro has received four upward earnings estimate revisions for its current quarter, as well as three for its full year.GoPro’s revenues are projected to soar 30.65% in its current quarter, based on our current consensus estimates. On top of quarterly growth, the company’s sales are expected to hit $1.35 billion for the full year, which would mark a 12.85% jump. And after a string of down years, GoPro’s earnings are projected to skyrocket over 100% this quarter and 99% for its full year.In terms of its stock price movement, shares of GoPro have gained over 14% in the last 12 weeks.  This positive movement has been driven in part by a commitment to its bottom line, which involved restructuring some of its business, as well as new holiday season product launches.Still, shares of the action camera company sit well below their 52-week high—something many investors will like based on its current upward trajectory. GoPro is set to report its third-quarter earnings on Nov. 1.Take-Two Interactive (TTWO  -  Free Report)Video game powerhouse Take-Two Interactive, which owns titles such as NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto, and others, is currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Take-Two is also part of the “Toys – Games – Hobbies” industry that currently rests in the top 15% of companies tracked by Zacks.Take-Two has gone on a meteoric rise over the last few years. Shares of Take-Two have skyrocketed over 112% so far this year and currently rest just below their all-time high of $107.53—which they reached earlier this month.Take-Two could see its stock price continue to climb if investors keep seeing the growth projection they have come to expect. The company sports a “B” grade for Growth in our Style Scores system, and its 28% current cash flow growth blows away the industry’s average—helping show that Take-Two is on a solid growth trajectory.On top of that, the company has topped earnings estimates—often by a wide margin—in each of the trailing eight quarters.With that said, the video game giant’s earnings are projected to climb 65% in its current quarter, while revenues are set to pop by over 22%. For its full-year, Take-Two revenues are expected to gain 12% to hit $1.82 billion.Take-Two is set to report its second-quarter 2018 earnings on Nov. 7.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.

635,TTWO,"Welcome to the second episode of Full-Court Finance, a new podcast from Zacks Investment Research focused on the intersection of sports, business, and the stock market. This week, we explore the rapid rise of esports.Esports is essentially professional video gaming. The all-encompassing term covers different video games, leagues, tournaments, companies, countries, and much more. Industry revenues are projected to skyrocket 41% this year to hit $696 million while reaching 385.5 million fans,according to a report by gaming-focused market research firm Newzoo.By 2020, advertising, sponsorship, media rights, consumer spending, and video game maker investment will help make esports a $1.5 billion industry.The U.S. government has granted work visas for professional video gamers, the Olympic Council of Asia recently voted to include esports in the 2018 Asian Games after a push from Alibaba (BABA  -  Free Report) subsidiary Alisports, and the Paris Olympic committee has even considered testing video game competitions at the summer games in 2024.Television and news giants including ESPN, NBC, and TBS have already committed to broadcasting and covering esports, which includes a focus on multiplayer online battle arena games Defense of the Ancients and League of Legends, as well as the first person shooter games Counter-Strike: Global Offensive and Overwatch.Esports are a massive draw for marketers and advertisers because their average audience is made up of mostly employed men between 18 to 35 years old—a demographic that has become harder to reach than ever.On top of this, gaming giants—Electronic Arts (EA  -  Free Report), Tencent Holdings (TCEHY  -  Free Report), Activision Blizzard (ATVI  -  Free Report), and Take-Two Interactive (TTWO  -  Free Report)—are all invested in esports’ long-term viability and success.And major sponsors of more traditional sports are already trying to cash in on professional video gaming. Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report) sponsored last year's League of Legends World Finals. American Express (AXP  -  Free Report), Geico, Bud Light, Audi, Buffalo Wild Wings , and others are all esports sponsors.Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) got ahead of the esports curve when it purchased esports streaming giant Twitch for about $1billion dollars in 2014. Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL  -  Free Report) YouTube has its own “gaming” section that streams esports. And esports events have sold out the Staples Center in Los Angeles and Madison Square Garden in New York City.Activision Blizzard’s new Overwatch league, which will kick off its inaugural season in January, is set up much like many more common sports with city-based teams, regularly scheduled games, playoffs, and minimum salaries for team members. Investors, including New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft, Los Angeles Rams owner Stan Kroenke, and others paid $20 million to purchase one of 12 teams in the league’s first season.Other major players in the sports world, such as Magic Johnson, Shaquille O’Neal, and the Golden State Warriors ownership group are all also heavily invested in esports. And the NBA is set to launch its first ever video game league where NBA team-associated clubs will do battle on virtual NBA 2K courts starting in 2018.But you will have to listen to the whole episode to find out more about this sport of the future!If you have any questions about this episode of Full-Court Finance please feel free to shoot us an email over at podcast@zacks.com.

(GLUU  -  Free Report) increased 3.8% to a new 52-week high of $4.33 and closed at the same price on Oct 13.Notably, shares of Gluu have gained 114.4% over the last one year, substantially outperforming the industry’s 32.6% rally. The outperformance can be attributed to strong adoption of the company’s gaming portfolio.Moreover, we believe the announcement of the company’s new “digital-entertainment project” in partnership with Grammy Award winning pop star Taylor Swift is also positive.Currently, Gluu carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here.The company has a market capital of $514.6 million and a long-term expected earnings growth rate of 15%.Diversified Game PortfolioGlu Mobile’s roster of games, especially its evergreen titles like Cooking Dash, Racing Rivals and Kim Kardashian: Hollywood have been primarily driving growth. Notably, the company’s revenues have beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the past two quarters.The company’s celebrity titles Kim Kardashian: Hollywood and Restaurant Dash: Gordon Ramsay also garnered considerable success. The former recorded $40 million in sales in the first three months, while the latter has generated $30 million so far.However, the other titles such as Katy Perry Pop, Britney Spears: American Dream and Nicki Minaj have fallen short of expectations. To add to it, the company has been incurring losses.Therefore, the company’s latest shift toward creating a social networking app called The Swift Line for the popular pop star is prudent in our view. The app, which is set for launch later this year, will enable the company to gain the support of the wide fan base of the singer.Nick Earl, President & CEO of Gluu, believes that the company will be able to create a “deeply social environment” by connecting Taylor’s fans with her for an interactive communication session.Reportedly, the app will be updated with the singer’s latest songs every week. The usage of Taylor special emojis, Taymojis, in conversations will also help them express their views freely.  We believe this will enable the company to witness a rise in user engagement and thereby drive growth.However, rising competition from established players like Electronic Arts (EA  -  Free Report), Take-Two (TTWO  -  Free Report) and Activision Blizzard (ATVI  -  Free Report) remains a concern.Glu Mobile Inc.

637,TTWO,"The swimming pool and lifestyle product maker, Pool Corporation (POOL  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 numbers on Oct 19, before the opening bell.Last quarter, the company witnessed a negative earnings surprise of 1.34%. However, prior to that, its earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the three quarters with the trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise coming in at 6.32%.Pool Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Pool Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Pool Corporation QuoteMarkedly, these earnings beats along with solid fundamentals helped Pool’s shares gain 20.2% in a year’s time, outperforming the industry’s 12.9% rally.Will the stock’s rally continue post third-quarter earnings release? Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for Pool this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Unfortunately, that is not the case here as elaborated below.Zacks ESP: Pool has an Earnings ESP of -1.01%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Pool carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company’s negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Notably, we caution you against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Factors Likely to Affect Q3 ResultsPool marked year-over-year growth in sales, gross profit and operating earnings for the 29th consecutive quarter in the second quarter of 2017. The trend is expected to continue in the to-be-reported quarter as well, backed by solid business sales growth and favorable trends in the housing market.Furthermore, the company’s leading market share position and opportunistic expansion strategies is likely to propel the top-line growth. In fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-quarter’s earnings and sales is projected at $1.16 and nearly $728 million, representing a year-over-year increase of 12.3% and 5.3%, respectively.Also, continuous growth in the remodel and replacement sectors of its business is a major positive. In addition, stronger consumer discretionary spending along with a tight supply situation are expected to have driven continued growth in new pool construction.However, unfavorable seasonality might hamper the company’s business and, in turn, impact sales. Meanwhile, macroeconomic headwinds given the company’s considerable international presence along with higher expenses might dent the quarter’s profitability.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies to consider as our model shows they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. (TTWO  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release results on Nov 7. It has an Earnings ESP of +3.63% and flaunts a Zacks Rank #1. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Polaris Industries Inc. (PII  -  Free Report) is slated to release results on Oct 24. It has an Earnings ESP of +1.57% and holds a Zacks Rank #2.MGM Resorts International (MGM  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +10.78% and carries a Zacks Rank #3. The company is slated to release results on Nov 8.5 Trades Could Profit """"Big-League"""" from Trump PoliciesIf the stocks above spark your interest, wait until you look into companies primed to make substantial gains from Washington's changing course.Today Zacks reveals 5 tickers that could benefit from new trends like streamlined drug approvals, tariffs, lower taxes, higher interest rates, and spending surges in defense and infrastructure.See these buy recommendations now >>

638,TTWO,"Shares of video game giants—including Activision Blizzard (ATVI  -  Free Report), Take Two Interactive (TTWO  -  Free Report), and Electronic Arts (EA  -  Free Report)—sank on Monday after a bearish analyst report on the state of the industry.Today’s cautionary take comes from Cowen. The investment banking firm downgraded several industry giants, including Take-Two and Activision, as well as Ubisoft Entertainment (UBSFY  -  Free Report).Shares of Call of Duty maker Activision Blizzard dropped by over 3%, while industry peer Electronic Arts stock fell by more than 1.50%. Shares of Take-Two Interactive, which makes NBA 2K and other big-name video game titles, tanked by over 4%.Interestingly enough, Cowen’s note comes in contrast to other recent analyst coverage. Just last week, Barclays’ analyst Ryan Gee started coverage on four of the biggest video game companies. Gee gave Electronic Arts (EA  -  Free Report) an “Overweight” rating and a price target of $129 a share, which marked a roughly 7.42% upside to last week’s closing price.Part of the reason for Gee’s initial bullish coverage is because he thinks EA’s Live Services’ revenues will grow over the next two years.The analyst also initiated coverage of Take-Two Interactive with an “Overweight” rating and a $115 price target. Take-Two’s $115 per share price target marked a nearly 7.25% upside compared to Friday’s closing price of $107.23 a share. Gee noted that Take-Two is monetizing popular video games more effectively compared to its peers.Gee also initiated coverage of video game powerhouse Activision Blizzard with an “Equal-Weight” rating along with a $65 a share price target, which marked a 2.77% upside to Friday’s closing price.Still, despite these recent relatively bullish Barclays’ rating, shares of all four of these companies sunk on Monday.Sales ProjectionsThis downgrade and brief investor retreat comes just a few days before market research firm NPD Group is set to release its September video game sales report.Stifel Nicolaus analyst Drew Crum expects that the Oct. 12 report will be very important for investors, as it includes some the industry’s biggest games—including NBA 2K18 and FIFA 18. The analyst projects overall video game sales will gain about 20%, while hardware and console sales will fall year-over-year.Crum expects Activision Blizzard’s September sales will be $90 million—up from $20 million a year ago, due in large part to the recent release of Destiny 2. He projects Take Two Interactive’s sales will fall in the high-single digits to $100 million, while Electronic Arts sales are projected to gain slightly to hit approximately $80 million.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

639,TTWO,"Investors may consider allocating their assets in stocks with favorable liquidity positions for big returns. Liquidity indicates a company’s capability of meeting debt obligations by converting assets into liquid cash and equivalents.However, one should exercise caution before investing in such stocks. While a high liquidity level may imply that the company is meeting its obligations at a faster rate compared to peers, it may also indicate that the company is failing to use its assets efficiently.Hence, one may consider the efficiency level of a company in addition to its liquidity to identify potential winners.Measures to Identify Liquid StocksLiquidity ratios like Current Ratio, Quick Ratio and Cash Ratio are primarily used to identify companies with strong liquidity.Current Ratio: It measures current assets relative to current liabilities. This ratio is used for measuring a company’s potential to meet both short- and long-term debt obligations. Thus, a current ratio – also known as working capital ratio – below 1 indicates that the company has more liabilities than assets. However, a high current ratio does not always indicate that the company is in good financial shape. It may also mean that the company has failed to utilize its assets significantly. Hence, a range of 1 to 3 is considered ideal.Quick Ratio: Unlike current ratio, quick ratio – also called “acid-test ratio"" or ""quick assets ratio"" – indicates a company’s ability to pay short-term obligations. It considers inventory excluding current assets relative to current liabilities. Like the current ratio, a quick ratio of greater than 1 is desirable.Cash Ratio: This is the most conservative ratio among the three, as it takes into account only cash and cash equivalents, and invested funds relative to current liabilities. It measures a company’s ability to meet its current debt obligations using the most liquid of assets. Though a cash ratio higher than 1 may point to sound financials, a high number may indicate inefficiency in using the cash.So, a ratio of greater than 1 is desirable at all times but may not always underline a company’s financial health.Screening ParametersIn order to pick the best of the lot, we have added asset utilization, which is a widely used measure of a company’s efficiency, as one of the screening criteria. Asset utilization is a ratio of total sales over the past 12 months to the last four-quarter average of total assets. Though this ratio varies across industries, companies with a ratio higher than their respective industries can be considered efficient.In order to ensure that these liquid and efficient stocks have solid growth potential, we have added our proprietary Growth Style Score to the screen.Current Ratio, Quick Ratio and Cash Ratio between 1 and 3 (While liquidity ratios of greater than 1 are desirable, significantly high ratios may indicate inefficiency.)Asset utilization greater than industry average (Higher asset utilization than the industry average indicates a company’s efficiency.)Zacks Rank equal to #1 (Only Strong Buy-rated stocks can get through. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.) Growth Style Score less than or equal to B (Back-tested results show that stocks with a Growth Style Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 handily beat other stocks.)These criteria have narrowed down the universe of over 7,700 stocks to only seven.Here are four of the seven stocks that qualified the screen:Goleta, CA-based AppFolio Inc. (APPF  -  Free Report) offers cloud-based software solutions for property management and legal industries. The company has a Growth Style Score of A and an average four-quarter positive earnings surprise of 241.67%.

(AMAT  -  Free Report) is engaged in developing, manufacturing and marketing semiconductor wafer fabrication equipment and related spare parts for the semiconductor industry. The company has a Growth Style Score of A and an average four-quarter positive earnings surprise of 2.66%.

(CROX  -  Free Report) is a rapidly growing designer, manufacturer and marketer of footwear, under the CROCS brand. It has an average four-quarter earnings surprise of 83.89% and a Growth Style Score of A. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 earnings has narrowed down from 7 cents to 3 cents per share over the last 30 days.Based in New York City, Take Two Interactive Software Inc (TTWO  -  Free Report) is a leading developer and publisher of video games and peripherals.

640,TTWO,"The holiday season is the most important time of the year for video game developers and distributors. The majority of the companies tend to release their most important titles couple of months ahead, particularly from September, to attract the maximum number of players.Hence, a strong and innovative game pipeline is of utmost importance for the companies as well as investors.Moreover, availability on the latest consoles decides the games growth trajectory during the holiday season. Notable manufacturers like Microsoft Corporation (MSFT  -  Free Report), Sony Corporation (SNE  -  Free Report) and Nintendo Co. Ltd (NTDOY  -  Free Report) also launch their flagship devices prior to the holiday season.Market research firm, Newzoo expects consoles to be the second largest revenue generator after mobile gaming with $33.5 billion in 2017.Microsoft Banks on Xbox OneMicrosoft’s much-awaited Xbox One X is set to release on Nov 7. Preorder volumes have already surpassed all previous records. Per media reports, preorder of the device is expected to go live again on Sep 21.Microsoft expects the new console to help in bridging the gap with Sony’s PS4. Per Venturebeat, Sony’s market share in the console hardware market was almost double that of Microsoft’s 26% at the end of 2016.However, lesser number of exclusive games can be a headwind for Microsoft. Sony has a much enriched line-up of exclusive titles for PS4 Pro, namely Gravity Rush 2, Tales Of Berseria, Yakuza 0, Nioh, Horizon Zero Dawn and Persona 5 among many others.Moreover, Microsoft will face competition from Nintendo. The Japan-based video game giant is set to launch Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) Classic Edition across the United States on Sep 29. The company is well poised on strong sales of its Switch console. Per Nintendo, as of Jun 30, 4.7 million units of Nintendo Switch (launched in March) have been sold globally.Mobile Games: The Cash CowsDespite strong anticipated demand for consoles like Xbox One, we believe that mobile games are the cash cows for gaming companies. Newzoo projects mobile game revenues to grow in the range of 32% - 40% over 2017-2020 time frame.The strong growth can be attributed to growing adoption of high-end smartphones and tablets.  Consumers are increasingly spending more on buying in-game items that are driving up the top line of companies. Per Newzoo, mobile gaming will be extremely lucrative and account for 42% of the total gaming market in 2017.E-Sports -  The Game ChangerE-sports are fast emerging as a lucrative business opportunity. Like traditional sports, even these are held at stadiums and televised or broadcast online. Importantly, these tournaments have alluring prize money.With continued increases in viewership, corporate sponsorships and growing media coverage, e-sports is here to stay. Per the latest report from Newzoo, in 2017, revenues from e-sports are expected to be up 41.3% to $696 million.3 Gaming Stocks in FocusLet’s focus on three stocks that have the most attractive game pipeline for the upcoming holiday season.Activision Blizzard Inc. (ATVI  -  Free Report)The company recently released its much awaited online multiplayer game Destiny 2 on PS4 and Xbox One console. Activision is set to release the Call of Duty: WWII on Nov 3.Call of Duty has been the most important revenue generating franchise for Activision over the years. The company should keep its fingers crossed with the new installment, as the last one – Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare – was a dampener.Activision is also strengthening presence in the e-sports market. The company recently set up Blizzard Arena Los Angeles, a state-of-the-art facility for e-sports events at Burbank Studios. With Overwatch recording stupendous success with 30 million players and counting, Activision has announced a league for this franchise as well.Activision sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Shares have gained 78.1% year to date, significantly outperforming the industry’s 49.2% rally.Electronic Arts Inc. (EA  -  Free Report) The company’s digital business continues to gain traction. After the success of Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes and Madden NFL Mobile, EA is gearing up to release a few more mobile games in the coming months.EA has a strong pipeline of new launches, which includes FIFA 18, Star Wars Battlefront sequel (Nov 17), and  Need for Speed Payback that features BMW Group’s all-new M5 model. Moreover, the company and Maxis announced Nov 10 as the release date for The Sims 4 Cats & Dogs Expansion Pack on PC and Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) Mac.Additionally, the company’s increasing focus on the lucrative e-sports market is likely to fuel growth. EA and the National Football League (NFL) recently announced a partnership to organize the Madden NFL Club Championship that will involve 32 NFL clubs.EA carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Shares have gained 52.6% year to date outperforming the industry’s 49.2% rally.Take-Two Interactive Software Inc. (TTWO  -  Free Report) The company is well-known for franchises like GTA and NBA2K. Reportedly, it is launching the new NBA 2K18 in Sep 2017 and WWE 2K18 on Oct 17.Take-Two is also aggressively pushing into the e-sports market. In February this year, the company inked a deal with NBA to launch NBA 2K eLeague. This made NBA the only professional sports league to have its own e-sports league. The league will be functional in 2018.Earlier this year, Take Two acquired the popular simulation game, Kerbal Space Program. A new Kerbal game – Kerbal Space Program: Making History Expansion – is also slated for launch this year.Take-Two also has a Zacks Rank #3. Shares have gained 107.7% year to date, substantially outperforming the industry’s 49.2% rally.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

641,TTWO,"Activision Blizzard Inc. (ATVI  -  Free Report) recently released the much awaited online multiplayer game Destiny 2 on Sony’s PlayStation4 (PS4) and Microsoft’s (MSFT  -  Free Report) XBox One consoles. The game is available at a retail price of $59.99.The PC-version of Destiny 2 is set to release on Oct 24. This is the first non-blizzard game that will be launched for PCs through Blizzard's PC gaming platform, Battle.net.The company has two extensions planned for this game. The first one, The Curse of Osiris, is expected to be launched in December 2017, per media reports.Further, Destiny 2 fans will be treated with Destiny 2 – Game + Expansion Pass Bundle priced at $89.99. Destiny 2 Digital Deluxe Edition and Limited Edition are both priced at $99.99. The Collector’s Edition, which is priced at $249.99, will feature “a fully-wearable Destiny 2 – Frontier Bag, Expansion Pass, premium digital content and a Cabal-themed Collector’s Box.”We believe the new title will help to sustain the momentum in Activision’s shares, which have gained 77.2% year to date, significantly outperforming the industry’s46.7% rally.Destiny 2 – A Key Growth DriverDestiny- the first title under Activision-Bungie’s 10-year deal – developed by Bungie of Halo fame and published by Activision was released on Sep 9, 2014. Reportedly, it achieved over $500 million in pre-order and first day sales. Moreover, in the first month, the game sold 6.3 million units, which generated $47.5 million in revenues. However, the series never had a PC version.With the launch of Destiny 2 on PCs, the company will be able to cater to a broader audience. The title has already received positive feedback from most of the reviewers, which include IGN, GameSpot and Metacritic.In the last earnings conference call, management noted Destiny 2’s beta and pre-orders have fared much better than what the first Destiny achieved during its pre-launch. It also stated that Destiny 2 full game pre-orders “have the highest digital mix in Activision's history.”Activision Blizzard, Inc Revenue (TTM) Activision Blizzard, Inc Revenue (TTM) | Activision Blizzard, Inc QuoteThe attractiveness of the game is further reflected in the number of awards it has won or has been nominated for. Destiny 2 won in the “Best PC Game” category of “Game Critics Awards: Best of E3 2017”. The game has also won the title of “Best Multiplayer Game” and “Best Social / Online Game” at Gamescom Awards 2017.Other FranchisesActivision’s expanding franchise portfolio that includes offerings like StarCraft, World of Warcraft, Diablo, Hearthstone and Heroes of the Storm will drive growth in the long haul. Recently, the company also released the Call of Duty: WWII Private Multiplayer Beta for pre-order customers on PS4 and Xbox One.We expect Call of Duty: WWII and Destiny 2 to be a big revenue driver going ahead. These titles also provide a competitive edge over the likes of Electronic Arts (EA  -  Free Report) and Take-Two Interactive Software Inc. (TTWO  -  Free Report) who are stepping up their efforts for the holiday season.Reportedly, Take Two will launch the new NBA 2K18 in September 2017 and WWE 2K18 on Oct 17.

642,TTWO,"Video game publishing giant, Activision Blizzard Inc. (ATVI  -  Free Report) released the Call of Duty: WWII Private Multiplayer Beta for pre-order customers on Sony’s PlayStation4 (PS4) systems over the last weekend. Reportedly, the second Private Multiplayer Beta weekend will begin on Sep 1 and run through Sep 4 on PS4 as well as Microsoft’s (MSFT  -  Free Report) Xbox One.Per the company, players of the Private Multiplayer Beta will receive the Private Multiplayer Beta Combat Pack, which will include a “specially-themed Private Multiplayer Beta helmet, calling card and emblem.” Apart from that, at select retailers, pre-order customers will also get Divisions Pack comprising “five Premium Gear Sets inspired by the five Divisions in Call of Duty: WWII multiplayer.”Developer Sledgehammer Games revealed that the beta version will deliver only a part of the full multiplayer experience as it plans to implement the feedback in the final game, which is set to release on Nov 3. The company seems to keep the interest of fans brewing by keeping out the brand new Headquarters social space from the beta version.Call of Duty – A Key Growth DriverActivision’s Call of Duty: WWII is the fourteenth installment of Call of Duty and the second game in the series set against the backdrop of World War II after Call of Duty: World at War released in 2008. World at War was one of the bestselling games that year with more than 2.75 million units sold. We believe the release of Call of Duty: WWII in November will have a similar impact and enable the company to make the most of the holiday season.Call of Duty is one of the most important revenue generators for the company. It has always lifted investors’ sentiment and raised expectations for future titles. The company has witnessed strong growth across all the Call of Duty franchises, except the Infinite Warfare title, which recorded relatively lower sales.Notably, last year, the company’s shares were up following the Call of Duty XP event. Earlier, in 2015, Call of Duty: Black Ops 3 earned over $550 million, globally, in its opening weekend.We believe the new title will help to sustain the momentum in Activision’s shares, which have gained 73.8% year to date, significantly outperforming the industry’s 46.7% rally. Other FranchisesActivision’s expanding franchise portfolio that includes offerings like StarCraft, World of Warcraft, Diablo, Hearthstone and Heroes of the Storm will drive growth in the long haul. Notably, the company is also set to launch Destiny 2 on Sep 6, ahead of the holiday season. We believe along with Call of Duty: WWII, Destiny 2 will also be a big revenue driver going ahead.Activision Blizzard, Inc Revenue (TTM) Activision Blizzard, Inc Revenue (TTM) | Activision Blizzard, Inc QuoteCompetition Activision faces severe competition from its peers like Electronic Arts (EA  -  Free Report) and Take-Two Interactive Software Inc. (TTWO  -  Free Report) who are stepping up their efforts to gear up for the holiday season. The holiday season is the most important time of the year for video game stocks. Most of the companies generate maximum sales during this time of the year. They go by the idea of ‘saving the best for the last’ and release their most important titles during the holiday season.Take Two, one of the leading names in the video game publishing arena, is driven by its well-known franchises like GTA and NBA2K as well as other franchises like WWE 2K, Mafia, Sid Meir’s Civilisation, BioShock, Battleborn, Max Payne and Red Dead. Reportedly, it is launching the new NBA 2K18 in Sep 2017 and WWE 2K18 on Oct 17.EA’s popularity is driven by franchises like EA SPORTS titles, along with Battlefield, Titanfall and Star Wars.

643,TTWO,"Share price of Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. (TTWO  -  Free Report) rallied to a new 52-week high of $95.11, eventually closing a tad lower at $94.95 on Aug 22. The stock has rallied 92.6% year to date, substantially outperforming the 48.1% gain of the industry it belongs to.The stock price momentum can be attributed to consistent results. We note that the company has beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, delivering an average positive surprise of 107.07%.We note that increasing digital revenues and strength in franchises like Grand Theft Auto and NBA 2K are primarily responsible for this strong growth. These factors are expected to help the stock sustain the momentum going ahead.Currently, Take-Two carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). The company has a market capital of $9.69 billion and a long-term expected earnings growth rate of 14%.Franchise Strength, Digital Revenues - Key CatalystsTake-Two, one of the leading names in the video game publishing arena, continues to benefit from its popular offerings like Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online, along with its other releases like NBA 2K and WWE 2K. In fact, higher sales of the digital version of the games add to the company’s margins.  Moreover, the company anticipates continuous growth in digital revenues driven by higher sales of full game downloads and increases in recurrent consumer spending.Additionally, Take-Two’s acquisition of game developer, Social Point is expected to boost its performance. Management expects Social Point to contribute 6% of net revenue in the current fiscal.Also, the company’s foray into the fast emerging e-sports market is a positive. In February this year, Take Two inked a deal with NBA to launch NBA 2K eLeague, which will be functional in 2018. We believe this will enable the company to grab a share of the growing e-sports industry and boost its top line.However, stiff competition from other game makers such as Activision Blizzard Inc. (ATVI  -  Free Report), Electronic Arts (EA  -  Free Report) and Glu Mobile Inc. (GLUU  -  Free Report) remains a major concern.Outstanding Q1 Results, Solid ViewTake-Two reported first-quarter fiscal 2018 earnings of 60 cents per share which came in much better than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 20 cents. The strong earnings performance was driven by higher net sales (excluding deferred revenues) of $348.3 million, which also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $287.1 million.For the second quarter, the company expects GAAP net revenue to be in the range of $400–$450 million. The company projects earnings in the range of 15–25 cents per share.For fiscal 2018, the company has increased its outlook for net sales, which is now projected in the band of $1.65–$1.75 billion compared with the previous guidance of $1.42–$1.52 billion.Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. Price and Consensus Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. Price and Consensus | Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. QuoteEstimate RevisionsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Take-Two moved up in the past 30 days, which reflects the optimistic outlook of analysts.

644,TTWO,"Electronic Arts Inc. (EA  -  Free Report) and the National Football League (NFL) recently announced a partnership to organize the Madden NFL Club Championship that will involve the 32 NFL clubs. Reportedly, players above 16 years who excel in EA’s Madden NFL in the United States, United Kingdom and Germany can play the tournament.Per media reports, the winner of this “largest competitive gaming commitment ever by a U.S. professional sports league” will get a lions’ share of the cash prize of $403,000 and two tickets to the Super Bowl 52 to be played in Minnesota.Growing E-Sports Market – Key CatalystE-sports, which are live video game tournaments, are fast emerging as a lucrative business opportunity. Like traditional sports, even these are held at stadiums and televised or broadcast online. Importantly, these tournaments have alluring prize money. Per NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, e-sports and competitive gaming are very attractive to the “younger and digitally savvy NFL audience”.EA’s involvement with NFL to attract e-sports gamers is a significant move for the company. With continued increases in viewership, corporate sponsorships and growing media coverage, e-sports is here to stay. Thus, the company’s initiatives to strengthen its presence in the e-sports market will help drive the top line.Per the latest report from Newzoo, in 2017, revenues from e-sports are expected to be up 41.3% to $696 million. From 2015 to 2020, revenues are likely to record CAGR of 35.6% to $1.49 billion.We believe this will help to sustain the momentum in EA shares, which have gained 51.1% year to date, outperforming the industry’s 44.4% rally.Stiffening Competition a HeadwindGiven the sound business opportunity, competition in this space has intensified.  Other video game companies like Activision Blizzard (ATVI  -  Free Report) and Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO  -  Free Report) are also making big moves to grab a share of this pie.With Overwatch recording stupendous success with 30 million players and counting, Activision has announced a league for this franchise as well. Activision has recorded first seven team (city-based) sales for the Overwatch league. A few days back, the company added that it has sold the London and Los Angeles teams for the league.Activision has long been making efforts to build its presence in this arena. In fact, the company has set up an exclusive e-sports unit spearheaded by former ESPN CEO Steve Bornstein. Also, it acquired MLG, a leading e-sports player for an estimated $46 million. Activision has already established Call of Duty World League.  After treading cautiously initially in the lucrative e-sports market, Take Two has accelerated its efforts. In February this year, the company inked a deal with NBA to launch NBA 2K eLeague. This made NBA the only professional sports league to have its own e-sports league. The league will be functional in 2018. Take Two has been conducting an NBA e-sports tournament for the last two years.Electronic Arts Inc. Price Electronic Arts Inc. Price | Electronic Arts Inc.

The upward revision is largely attributable to lesser-than-expected impact of foreign exchange rates.

647,TTWO,"Activision Blizzard Inc. (ATVI  -  Free Report) posted second-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of 51 cents and revenues (excluding deferrals) of $1.418 billion, easily beating the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate of 25 cents and $1.214 billion. However, on a year-over-year basis, revenues were down approximately 10%. Shares were down over 2% in the aftermarket trading.Quarterly NumbersIncluding deferral revenues, Activision reported sales of $1.631 billion, up 3.9%. The top line was driven by continued strength in digital revenues, success of Overwatch and the buyout of King Digital Entertainment.Activision earned $1 billion of in-game revenues in the quarter. Also, the company announced the first seven-team sales for its Overwatch league.Activision Blizzard, Inc Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Activision Blizzard, Inc Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Activision Blizzard, Inc QuoteSegment wise, product sales were $481 million, down 4%, whereas subscription, licensing and other revenues grew 7.6% to $1.150 billion.On the basis of distribution channels, Activision reported retail channel sales of $260 million (down 30% year over year) and digital online revenues of $1.309 billion (up 15%). Digital revenues contributed 80% of total revenue in the quarter. Other revenues grew 13% year over year to $62 million.On a geographical basis, revenues from North America were flat at $858 million, while that from EMEA grew 6% to $538 million. Revenues from Asia Pacific grew 16% to $235 million.On a non-GAAP (redefined) basis, operating income was $576 million compared with $480 million reported in the year-ago quarter.Notably, Activision and a host of other video-game companies have changed the way they report their non-GAAP fiscal results to meet stricter guidelines imposed by the SEC. The company will no longer include the impact from revenue deferrals accounting treatment on certain online-enabled products.The company had over 407 million monthly active users (MAUs) at quarter end.Activision and Blizzard divisions’ online player community MAUs were 47 million and 46 million, respectively. King Digital reported MAUs of 314 million due to the absence of any big releases.Financial PositionActivision exited the quarter with $3.278 billion in cash and cash equivalents.

On a non-GAAP basis, revenues and earnings are likely to be $1.385 billion and 34 cents per share, respectively. Deferral revenues are expected to be around $315 million.Our TakeActivision has been benefiting from its focus on broadening its franchise portfolio, innovation and initiatives to expand to new geographies. Its offerings like StarCraft, World of Warcraft, Heroes of the Storm and Call of Duty are widely popular and should continue to contribute to the bottom line.Activision is aggressively working on becoming a media entertainment giant, somewhere on the lines of The Walt Disney Company. Apart from launching a movie studio, the company is also strengthening its presence in the lucrative e-sports market. Recently, the company announced the launch of Overwatch e-sports league. It also introduced a new consumer product division to be spearheaded by an ex-Walt Disney executive, Tim Kiplin. The higher adoption of free-to-play games and significant competition from the likes of Electronic Arts (EA  -  Free Report) , Take Two Interactive (TTWO  -  Free Report) and Glu Mobile (GLUU  -  Free Report) remain near-term headwinds. Also, an uncertain macro-economic outlook adds to its woes as video games form a part of discretionary spending. Also, the company’s dependence on a handful of mega franchises (Call of Duty, World of Warcraft) for the lion’s share of its revenues makes it highly vulnerable.Zacks Rank & Stock Price MovementCurrently, Activision carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Net sales (operational metric) are projected in the band of $465–$515 million.For fiscal 2018, the company has increased outlook for net sales and net cash provided by operating activities whereas reducing expectations for net revenue and net income. Reduction of outlook stems from the fact that company is extending life of Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online for purposes of calculating deferral. Though this will not impact net sales, the company will incur higher internal royalties, hence the downgrade.Net sales are projected in the band of $1.65–$1.75 billion compared with $1.42–$1.52 billion. Operating cash flow is estimated to be around $200 million compared with $150 million expected earlier.GAAP net revenues are likely to be in the band of $1.62–$1.72 billion compared with $1.95–$2.05 billion projected earlier. The company now projects earnings per share in the range of $1.00–$1.25.Our TakeThe company continues to benefit from its popular offerings like Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online, along with its other releases like NBA 2K and WWE 2K.

QuoteFactors at PlayTake Two is likely to benefit from its popular offerings like Grand Theft Auto V, Grand Theft Auto online, NBA 2K18 and WWE 2K18. The company banks on growth in digital revenues driven by higher sales of full-game download and increase in recurrent consumer spending.Per SuperData’s March 2018 report, NBA 2K18 and GTA V ranked among the top 10 digital game sales on console. In fact, increased sales of the digital version of the games are adding to the company’s margins.Additionally, the acquisition of game developer, Social Point, which enabled the company to foray into free-to-play games space, has been a positive. Games like Dragon City and Monster Legends, which were also updated in the soon-to-be reported quarter are expected to drive results.Further, Take Two remains optimistic about its new publishing label Private Division, the publisher of the popular simulation game, Kerbal Space Program, which released new contents in the fourth-quarter.However, the growing popularity for Epic Games’ Fortnite is an overhang on Take Two. This is evident from SuperData’s February report, which states that monthly active users of Fortnite were more than that of GTA V.Rising competition from the likes of Electronic Arts (EA  -  Free Report), Activision Blizzard (ATVI  -  Free Report) and Zynga  remains a headwind.

Notably, Overwatch League had a scintillating start with more than 10 million viewers watching the event in the first week of the inaugural season. We note that the launch of Overwatch League is driving viewership, corporate sponsorships and media coverage for Activision.However, the growing craze for Epic Games’ Fortnite is an overhang on Activision as many analysts fear that engagement will decline due to this.Also, higher adoption of free-to-play games and significant competition from the likes of Electronic Arts (EA  -  Free Report), Take Two Interactive (TTWO  -  Free Report) and Glu Mobile (GLUU  -  Free Report) are concerns.Activision Blizzard, Inc Price and EPS Surprise Activision Blizzard, Inc Price and EPS Surprise | Activision Blizzard, Inc QuoteWhat Does Our Model Say?According to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP.

660,TTWO,"Welcome to the latest episode of the Full-Court Finance podcast from Zacks Investment Research. On this week’s episode, we dive into BodyArmor as the sports drink newcomer looks to take on Gatorade. Next, we discuss the NBA’s latest deal with Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) Twitch, before we close with a look at a deal that could impact Disney’s (DIS  -  Free Report) brand new ESPN+ streaming service.BodyArmor—which has no relation to Under Armour (UAA  -  Free Report)—is ready to take on PepsiCo’s (PEP  -  Free Report) Gatorade and Coca-Cola’s (KO  -  Free Report) Powerade in the multibillion-dollar sports drink market. Those unfamiliar with BodyArmor might soon see the company a lot more after it launched its latest national television campaign, which features some big stars, including James Harden.The company could also get a real boost from one of its largest investors, Kobe Bryant, who also happens to play a big role in BodyArmor’s creative vision. BodyArmor has a long way to go to try to catch up to Powerade and Gatorade, but the drink market is going through a massive shake-up recently. And with Dr Pepper Snapple Group  as another major investor, BodyArmor could be poised to become a legitimate long-term player in the sports drink market.Full-Court Finance then transitions into the NBA’s latest streaming rights deal with Twitch for its brand new esports league, which the NBA created in partnership with Take-Two Interactive (TTWO  -  Free Report). The NBA has been on the cutting edge of a lot of media trends, and its growing relationship with Amazon could end up playing a much bigger role as streaming TV providers, from Hulu to YouTube TV (GOOGL  -  Free Report), slowly look to enter the live sports business.We then close with a look at a possible partnership between ESPN and Fox (FOXA  -  Free Report). The two companies reportedly proposed to split a UFC TV package last week that, if completed, would see some UFC fights move to Disney’s brand new ESPN+ streaming service (also read: Should Disney Investors Worry As ESPN Plus Underwhelms?).Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

GameOn, which was built on Amazon’s AWS cloud infrastructure, will also allow gamers to win prizes, most of which Amazon will offer through its e-commerce site.Amazon sees its new cloud gaming division as a way to profit from the proliferation of gaming and the rise of esports. The basic idea is that millions of people play video games and want to experience high-level competition with real monetary benefits on the line, but not all of them are at the level of professional gamers.“Game developers have consistently told us they are looking for ways to increase player engagement and retention,” Amazon’s Director of Competitive Gaming, Marja Koopmans, said in a statement. “We built Amazon GameOn to give developers simple, yet powerful tools to foster community through competitive gameplay.”Some relatively well-known gaming companies and esports teams, including nWay, Game Insight, and Millennial Esports’ Eden Games, are currently using GameOn.Amazon’s new competitive gaming platform comes nearly four years after the company purchased esports streaming platform Twitch for nearly $1 billion.The esports ecosystem is expected to expand by almost 40% in 2018 to become a $905.6 million business, based on new estimates from market research firm NewZoo.

Take-Two Interactive (TTWO  -  Free Report) and Electronic Arts (EA  -  Free Report) have also bolstered their partnerships with more mainstream sports.Amazon looks poised to capitalize on esports while also infusing its e-commerce business with another potential revenue stream through GameOn-based prizes. The company is also set to take on Microsoft’s (MSFT  -  Free Report) quickly expanding gaming unit.Microsoft recently purchased a similar tournament and leaderboard-based gaming service called PlayFab, and also just launched its own cloud-based gaming division.Breaking News: Cryptocurrencies Now Bigger than VisaThe total market cap of all cryptos recently surpassed $700 billion – more than a 3,800% increase in the previous 12 months.

663,TTWO,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. (TTWO  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 5.3% in that time frame.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is TTWO due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Recent EarningsTake Two Interactive Software reported earnings of $1.26 per share for the third quarter of fiscal 2018, which increased 46.5% from the year-ago quarter.The company's net revenues came in at $480.8 million, marginally higher than $476.5 million reported in the year-ago period.Continued increase in digital revenues and strength in games like Grand Theft Auto V, Grand Theft Auto Online, NBA 2K18, WWE 2K18 , WWE SuperCard and L.A. Noire boosted results.Given the continuous growth in digital revenues, driven by increase in recurrent consumer spending, Take Two increased its outlook for fiscal 2018.Quarter DetailsNet bookings of $653.9 million declined 12.2% on a year-over-year basis due to a 29% fall in bookings from Physical retail and other segments. However, digitally delivered net bookings (58% of total net bookings) grew 6% to $380 million. Recurrent consumer spending net bookings increased 44% and represented 40% of total net bookings.In the free-to-play games space, Social Point's mobile games Dragon City and Monster Legends contributed meaningfully to net bookings. Social Point is also expected to provide a long-term growth opportunity to the company.Per the company, digital revenues (54% of total revenue) increased 7.6% to $258.4 million while revenues from Physical retailer and other segments (46% of total revenue) were down 5.9% to $222.4 million.Region-wise, revenues from the United States (55% of total revenue) were up 1.9% to $262.3 million. International markets revenues declined 0.2% to $218.5 million.MarginsTake Two’s gross margin of 44.3% expanded 960 basis points (bps) year over year, backed by fall in software development costs. Management expects shift to digital distribution to drive margins moving forward.Income from operations was $8.9 million against loss from operations of $28.4 million reported in the prior-year quarter.Balance SheetAs of Dec 31, 2017, Take Two had $1.32 billion in cash and short-term investments, compared with $1.26 billion as of Sep 30, 2017.OutlookTake Two provided guidance for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2018. Strength in franchises like Grand Theft Auto, NBA 2K and WWE 2K will boost the top line in the fiscal year.Take Two formed a new publishing label Private Division this quarter, which is the publisher of the popular simulation game, Kerbal Space Program, acquired by the company in May 2017. The company expects Private Division to be a key growth driver going ahead. Kerbal Space Program is also viewed “as a long term franchise” that complements Take Two’s “portfolios of own intellectual property.”For the fourth quarter, the company expects net bookings to be in the band of $410–$460 million. GAAP net revenues are projected in the band of $460–$510 million.The company projects operating expenses to be in the range of $190 million to $200 million, up 34% at mid-point due to higher acquisition costs as well as higher marketing and R&D expenses. The company projects GAAP income per share in the range of 73–83 cents.For fiscal 2018, net bookings are projected in the band of $1.99–$2.04 billion, compared with $1.93–$2.03 billion. Net bookings from current consumer spending are expected to increase 50% while digitally-delivered net bookings are projected to increase 25%.GAAP net revenues are likely to be in the band of $1.80–$1.85 billion compared with $1.74–$1.84 billion projected earlier.

664,TTWO,"Perhaps no entertainment medium is as universally beloved as video games. From the days of arcade cabinets to the console revolution and the advent of virtual-reality gaming, people around the world have always loved video games.Today, the global gaming industry is adjusting to its latest trend: esports. Video games tend to be competitive by nature, but esports bring the intensity of this competition to the next level. And just like a traditional physical contest like a soccer game or boxing match, esports require high-level training, sportsmanship, and clutch performance.Competitive gaming at a professional level is a relatively new concept, but money is already flowing into the industry at a rapid pace. Pro gamers are now facing off in international tournaments, racking up corporate sponsorships, and battling for multi-million dollar prizes.But is this just another quirky trend, or should investors consider esports a legitimate growth industry? There are certainly plenty of publicly-traded video game companies, but will any of them feel the effects of esports? Is there any money to be made here? Let’s take a closer look.Market SizeThe global esports economy is expected to grow to more than $905 million in 2018, according to market research firm Newzoo. That figure would represent year-over-year growth of roughly 38%.About 77% of this cash will be generated directly through sponsorships and advertising and indirectly through media rights and content licenses. Game publisher fees are expected to account for 13% of this year’s economy, while merchandise and event ticketing will bring in about 10%.“As a business, esports is now entering a new and critical phase toward maturity. Big investments have been made, new league structures have been launched, sponsorship budgets have moved from experimental to continuous, and international media rights trade is starting to heat up,” said Newzoo CEO Peter Warman.But as one would expect with any young business, rising revenue does not necessarily mean profits are being realized yet.“Profitability and return on investment is, for many organizations at the heart of the Esports Economy, a challenge,” Warman added.Nevertheless, we can see that the scope of the esports industry—and its rapid rate of growth—should put it every investor’s radar. With this much money pouring in, people need their own strategies if they want to be among the first wave that profits from esports.Investment IdeasOne low-exposure method for investing in esports is buying shares in Wall Street darling Nvidia (NVDA  -  Free Report). This trendy company makes high-end graphics processing units (GPUs) that are marketed towards PC gamers. These GPUs are a top choice for professional gamers, who understandably need their machines to perform at the highest level.Nvidia has attracted attention because of its investments in machine learning, artificial intelligence, and self-driving cars, but gaming is still the company’s core business. The rise of esports promises to generate even more interests in its GPUs, and the stock is already sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).The more direct approach to investing in esports is through the video game publishers. Millions of people are tuning in to watch professional gamers play some of the world’s most-popular games, which increases brand awareness and drives licensing fees for these companies. And these brands are certainly looking for ways to cash in further from this business.For example, Electronic Arts (EA  -  Free Report) recently launched its “EA Competitive Gaming Division.” This new group focuses on operating professional leagues for games like FIFA, Madden NFL, and Battlefield. Meanwhile, Take-Two Interactive (TTWO  -  Free Report) partnered up the National Basketball Association to launch the “NBA 2K eLeague,” which will feature a team operated by each of the NBA’s 30 franchises (also read: Esports Goes Mainstream with NBA, FIFA Deals).Another video game publisher that stands to benefit from esports is Activision Blizzard (ATVI  -  Free Report). Activision recently purchased a major esports company, Major League Gaming, for $46 million.  ATVI also just started a professional league for its immensely-popular Overwatch game. The new “Overwatch League” is the first pro league of its kind, with 12 teams representing cities from around the globe.But one of the most promising “esports stocks” right now is Chinese internet giant Tencent Holdings (TCEHY  -  Free Report). Tencent owns Riot Games, the developer of one of the world’s most-popular games, League of Legends. According to Newzoo, League of Legends was the second-most watched game on Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) Twitch streaming platform during the month of January.Tencent is also uniquely positioned to succeed in Asian markets, which continues to be the hottest region for esports. Tencent is currently sporting a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Want more market analysis from this author?

665,TTWO,"Electronic Arts’ (EA  -  Free Report) Maxis division recently launched The Sims Mobile — the much awaited latest version of the popular The Sims franchise — worldwide on iOS and Android devices.Notably, The Sims is one of the most important revenue generators for EA. The Sims FreePlay recorded enormous success in the last quarter.Moreover, player base for the PC and Console-version The Sims 4 grew more than 35% year over year driven by the launch of “highest performing expansion pack to date”.Markedly, the company’s strength in digital business is boosted by live services and mobile games. In the prior quarter, a 12% improvement in Digital net bookings year over year was driven by 39% and 5% increase in Live services and Mobile delivery net bookings, respectively. In fact, net bookings from Live services’ were backed by robust performance by The SIMS 4 and Ultimate Team.Mobile Games – A Key Growth DriverAfter the success of Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes and Madden NFL Mobile, EA has been gearing up to expand its mobile business.Per market research firm Newzoo, by 2020, more than 50% of the revenues will stem from mobile games. Therefore, to cash in on the booming mobile games market, EA plans to expand its mobile portfolio with the launch of two games this year and more in the coming years.In fact, FIFA Mobile is one of the key growth drivers for the company. Last quarter, it added 26 million players.Electronic Arts Inc. Revenue (TTM) Electronic Arts Inc. Revenue (TTM) | Electronic Arts Inc. QuoteNew Titles to Provide Competitive EdgeEA has two other games slated to release in the current quarter. Burnout Paradise Remastered will be available from Mar 16 on Sony’s PlayStation 4 and Microsoft’s Xbox One. Meanwhile, A Way Out is scheduled to be released on Mar 23.In February, EA and Swedish studio Zoink Games released Fe for players on Xbox One, PS4, Nintendo Switch, and Origin for PC. EA also launched UFC 3 for Xbox One and PS4 in the same month.We believe the new titles will help EA to counter intensifying competition and offset lackluster performance from Star Wars Battlefront 2, which had been a setback for the company. In a year’s time, shares of EA have surged 42.9% underperforming its peers like Activision (ATVI  -  Free Report), Take-Two (TTWO  -  Free Report) and Gluu Mobile (GLUU  -  Free Report) that gained 52.5%, 87.1% and 106.8%, respectively.Currently, EA carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

666,TTWO,"Direxion launched a new fund on Feb 15, 2018, focused on providing 1.25x exposure to the mid-cap space of the U.S. equity markets.Portfolio+ S&P Mid Cap ETF (PPMC  -  Free Report) tracks the S&P Mid Cap 400 Index (+125%) and provides leveraged access to the mid-cap space of the U.S. equity markets.Fund CharacteristicsThe fund’s index seeks to provide investment results that closely track the performance of mid-cap companies in the U.S. markets. The S&P Mid Cap 400 Index measures the performance of 400 American mid-sized companies and is a float-adjusted market capitalization weighted index. It has amassed AUM of $25 million within a few days of trading and has a moderate expense ratio of 40 basis points a year.From a sector look, Information Technology, Financials and Industrials are the top three allocations of the index, with 17.5%, 17.1% and 15.8% exposure, respectively. From a top holdings perspective, the index has 0.7% exposure each to Take Two Interactive Software Inc (TTWO  -  Free Report), SVB Financial Group (SIVB  -  Free Report) and NVR Inc (NVR  -  Free Report). However, investors should note that investing in mid-cap stocks requires a steady appetite for risk, as they are more volatile than their large-cap counterparts.How Does it Fit in a Portfolio?U.S. markets recently suffered a sell-off owing to fears of rising interest rates. The S&P 500 entered correction territory, as it declined more than 10% from the record high set in January.However, mid-caps appeal to investors as they still have some growth potential and are relatively less risky than their small-cap counterparts.  U.S. economic fundamentals seem to be strong with a slew of upbeat economic data, strong corporate fundamentals and President Donald Trump's tax-reform signed into law. Mid-caps have less international exposure compared to large-caps and are expected to benefit greatly from the tax reform and provide diversification benefits to investors.CompetitionThe fund faces a lot of competition from other funds in the space. Below we discuss a few ETFs that seek to provide exposure to the mid-cap space of the U.S. equity markets (see all Leveraged Equity ETFs here).Direxion Daily Mid Cap Bull 3X Shares (MIDU  -  Free Report)    This fund provides 3x leveraged exposure to mid-sized U.S. equities.It has AUM of $63.7 million and charges a fee of 109 basis points a year.

Take-Two Interactive (TTWO  -  Free Report) and Electronic Arts (EA  -  Free Report) have also bolstered their partnerships with more mainstream sports.Take-Two and the NBA’s new “NBA 2K League” is set to tip off its inaugural season this spring. When it does, the NBA will become the first major North American sports league to run an esports league.The NBA’s new esports league does yet have a media rights partner. There are, however, a few likely frontrunners. The league already works with Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) Twitch platform to stream G League games, and Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) and Twitter (TWTR  -  Free Report) are both actively trying to expand their streaming content options.At the same time, the most popular sport in the world, soccer, is hoping to grow its reach through joint ventures between EA’s FIFA video game and pro leagues around the world, including the MLS.Esports have been on the rise for years. Yet, its growth has been largely tied to games such as Tencent-owned (TCEHY  -  Free Report) League of Legends and other multiplayer battle games. Now, esports have the chance to become even bigger with the successful adoption and integration of widely popular games for mainstream sports, like Madden and NBA 2K.If you have any questions about this episode of Full-Court Finance please feel free to shoot us an email over at podcast@zacks.com.

Noire boosted results.Given the continuous growth in digital revenues, driven by increase in recurrent consumer spending, Take Two increased its outlook for fiscal 2018.Quarter DetailsNet bookings of $653.9 million declined 12.2% on a year-over-year basis due to a 29% fall in bookings from Physical retail and other segments. However, digitally delivered net bookings (58% of total net bookings) grew 6% to $380 million. Recurrent consumer spending net bookings increased 44% and represented 40% of total net bookings.In the free-to-play games space, Social Point's mobile games Dragon City and Monster Legends contributed meaningfully to net bookings.

QuoteMarginsTake Two’s gross margin of 44.3% expanded 960 basis points (bps) year over year, backed by fall in software development costs. Management expects shift to digital distribution to drive margins moving forward.Income from operations was $8.9 million against loss from operations of $28.4 million reported in the prior-year quarter.Balance SheetAs of Dec 31, 2017, Take Two had $1.32 billion in cash and short-term investments, compared with $1.26 billion as of Sep 30, 2017.OutlookTake Two provided guidance for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2018. Strength in franchises like Grand Theft Auto, NBA 2K and WWE 2K will boost the top line in the fiscal year.Take Two formed a new publishing label Private Division this quarter, which is the publisher of the popular simulation game, Kerbal Space Program, acquired by the company in May 2017. The company expects Private Division to be a key growth driver going ahead. Kerbal Space Program is also viewed “as a long term franchise” that complements Take Two’s “portfolios of own intellectual property.”For the fourth quarter, the company expects net bookings to be in the band of $410–$460 million. GAAP net revenues are projected in the band of $460–$510 million.The company projects operating expenses to be in the range of $190 million to $200 million, up 34% at mid-point due to higher acquisition costs as well as higher marketing and R&D expenses.

670,TTWO,"We are in the thick of the Q4 earnings season with 251 of the S&P 500 members having released their quarterly numbers (as of Feb 2) and another 92 scheduled to report.Per the latest Earnings Preview, 80.5% of the S&P 500 companies that have reported have surpassed earnings estimates, 78.1% beat revenue estimates and 64.9% outpaced both earnings and revenues.Further, total earnings for these companies have increased 16% from the same period last year on 10.5% higher revenues. The report projects a 13% year-over-year rise in earnings for the S&P 500 companies with total revenues likely to increase 7.7%. This compares favorably with the year-over-year increase of 6.7% and 5.9% for earnings and revenues, respectively, in the third quarter.A Mixed Bag for Consumer DiscretionaryWhile a few sectors are expected to put up a stellar show, the widely diversified Consumer Discretionary sector is likely to post mixed results.Total earnings for the sector are likely to decline 3.7% year over year against 0.9% growth in the last quarter. Total revenues are projected to grow 3.7% year over year in Q4, slightly higher than the 3.5% growth recorded in the preceding quarter. Margins in the quarter are likely to decline 0.8% from the year-ago quarter, comparing unfavorably with the prior quarter’s decline of 0.3%.The Toys - Games – Hobbies Industry under consumer discretionary is expected to have recorded growth in Q4 on rising demand for entertainment services, including video games. The industry performed remarkably well in the past year gaining 49.8%, outpacing the S&P 500’s 21.1%.Traditional Toy Makers in a FixToy companies have been grappling with declining demand for traditional toys for quite some time now. Pressure from the recent Toys ‘R’ Us bankruptcy have affected their third-quarter results and might have dented growth in Q4 as well. As a result, we have seen Mattel (MAT  -  Free Report) report fourth-quarter 2017 adjusted loss of 72 cents per share, comparing unfavorably with the Zacks Consensus Estimate and the prior quarter’s earnings. Net sales also missed the consensus mark and declined year over year.Meanwhile, another leading U.S. toymaker Hasbro (HAS  -  Free Report) is expected to deliver strong revenues and earnings owing to the company’s efforts to counter the prevailing challenges in the operating environment. The company is expected to report its quarterly results on Feb 7.The consensus estimate for Q4 earnings is pegged at $1.82, mirroring nearly 11% year-over-year growth. We believe that this growth is attributable to the company’s efficient cost structure coupled with various sales-boosting efforts in some key markets.Meanwhile, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $1.73 billion, reflecting 6.4% year-over-year growth. The projected sales growth is primarily backed by strong performance of the company’s Franchise Brands, Partner Brand, Hasbro Gaming and Emerging Brand. Also, entertainment initiatives and higher consumer product sales are likely to drive revenues.However, the Toys ‘R’ Us bankruptcy will keep Hasbro’s top line under pressure. The bankruptcy disrupted the company’s growth plans in Q4 and had even paused shipments for a short period. Taking the adverse impacts into account, the company has slashed its Q4 revenue growth guidance to a range of 4% to 7%.

QuoteVideo Game Developers Enjoy an EdgeWithin the industry, th video game marketers and developers are well poised for growth. Strength in digital business and mobile games are key growth drivers for these companies.A big name in the space, Electronic Arts (EA  -  Free Report) recently reported an earnings beat in third-quarter fiscal 2018. Meanwhile, Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. (TTWO  -  Free Report) — a leading developer and publisher of video games and peripherals — is scheduled to report third-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Feb 7.The company’s expectation of growth in digital revenues driven by higher sales of full-game downloads and increase in recurrent consumer spending is encouraging. Subsequently, the consensus estimate for third-quarter revenues is pegged at $673.28 million, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 41.3%.The consensus estimate for EPS stands at $1, showing a year-over-year increase of 16.3%. We believe increased sales from the digital version of games are driving margins. Moreover, strength in franchises has backed the company’s earnings growth projection.Take-Two Interactive has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of +1.93, a combination that suggests a beat.

671,TTWO,"Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. (TTWO  -  Free Report) may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Take-Two Interactive Software is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings—with the most up-to-date information possible—is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for TTWO in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $1.02 per share for TTWO, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.00 per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for TTWO, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +1.93% heading into earnings season.Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10 year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here).Given that TTWO has a Zacks Rank #3 and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Clearly, recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for Take-Two Interactive Software, and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - Q1 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 11X over. Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we're willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation.See Them Free>>

672,TTWO,"Electronic Arts Inc. (EA  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fiscal third-quarter 2018 results on Jan 30.The company has beaten the Zack Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, delivering an average positive surprise of 24.78%.Last quarter, the company reported non-GAAP earnings of 66 cents per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 55 cents. Net bookings, which matched the consensus mark, came in at $1.18 billion, up 7.4% year over year.However, Electronic Arts’ outlook for the third quarter of fiscal 2018, which includes the important holiday season, is lower than expected. For the quarter, the company expects net bookings to be $2 billion whereas the Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at $2.03 billion. Electronic Arts Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Electronic Arts Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Electronic Arts Inc. Quote Factors at PlayEA’s popularity is primarily driven by its well-known franchises, which has been the key growth driver for the company. EA SPORTS titles, along with Battlefield, Titanfall and Star Wars are some of its biggest franchises.In third-quarter fiscal 2018, Electronic Arts released the highly-awaited Star Wars Battlefront II game, Need for Speed Payback and The Sims 4 (Console). The quarter will also include the sale of FIFA 18 that was released on Sep 29, 2017. FIFA remains one of the most popular titles among gamers.Apart from popular titles, it is the shift to digital that has proved to be a major growth driver for Electronic Arts. Digital sales now contribute to the majority of revenues. Additionally, the live services component (includes revenues from extra content and subscriptions, advertising, and others) of EA games has also emerged as a big growth driver.However, the launch of Battlefront 2 was a disappointment for the company. The game did not receive very positive reviews. The outrage over the exorbitant pricing of in-games purchases compelled EA to temporarily turn off all micro transactions in the game, apparently.The controversy regarding Battlefront 2 has been a dampener and thus sales are anticipated to be lower than its predecessor, which recorded tremendous success in the third quarter of fiscal 2017.  The underperformance of The Sims 4 will also remain an overhang on results.In the quarter, the company also completed the acquisition of Titanfall maker, Respawn Entertainment in a cash and stock deal worth $315 million.Rise in operating expenses, mainly due to higher investments in games and live services will weigh on the bottom line.  Stiff competition from other game makers like Activision Blizzard Inc. (ATVI  -  Free Report), Take Two Interactive (TTWO  -  Free Report) and Glu Mobile Inc. (GLUU  -  Free Report) remains a major concern.What Our Model SaysAccording to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP. The Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) are best avoided.

673,TTWO,"Welcome to the eighth episode of Full-Court Finance, the podcast from Zacks Investment Research focused on the intersection of sports, business, and the stock market. On this week’s episode, we jump into the business of college basketball to help provide investors deeper insights into the world of big-time NCAA hoops, as the likes of Nike (NKE  -  Free Report), CBS (CBS  -  Free Report), ESPN, and others continue to fuel the sport.Big-time programs engulfed in scandal, debate surrounding the one-and-done rule, and the NCAA’s role in enforcing amateurism are likely to remain some of the biggest storylines during the 2017-18 college basketball season, even as the regular season begins to heat up.Still, in an era where blue chip college basketball programs, such as the University of Kentucky, Indiana, and Duke, could be worth upwards of $340 million on the open market, the sport is seemingly more profitable than ever.CBS and Turner  are set to spend billions of dollars on the rights to the roughly one month NCAA March Madness tournament through 2032. On top of that, major sponsors of one of the biggest U.S. sporting events such as Coke , AT&T (T  -  Free Report), and Capital One (COF  -  Free Report) aren’t likely to leave anytime soon. And this just covers the most mainstream portion of the college hoops season.Disney’s (DIS  -  Free Report) struggling sports media network, ESPN, is deeply invested in college basketball. The nearly five-month regular season is fueled by marquee games presented by the likes of Lowe’s (LOW  -  Free Report) and sponsor-laden in-season tournaments tied to Progressive (PGR  -  Free Report), Gildan (GIL  -  Free Report), 2K TTWO, and many more. Even social media powerhouse Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) bought the rights to live stream college basketball this season.Lastly, as many college basketball fans and investors already know, Nike, Adidas (ADDYY  -  Free Report), and Under Armour UAA might be the real lifeblood of NCAA hoops.If you have any questions about this episode of Full-Court Finance please feel free to shoot us an email over at podcast@zacks.com.

674,TTWO,"Growth stocks can be some of the most exciting picks in the market, as these high-flyers can captivate investors’ attention, and produce big gains as well. However, these can also lead on the downside when the growth story is over, so it is important to find companies which are still seeing strong growth prospects in their businesses.One such company that might be well-positioned for future earnings growth is Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. (TTWO  -  Free Report). This firm, which is in the Electronics - Miscellaneous Components industry, saw EPS growth of 21.4% last year, and is looking great for this year too.In fact, the current growth estimate for this year calls for earnings-per-share growth of 14.3%. Furthermore, the long-term growth rate is currently an impressive 15.4%, suggesting pretty good prospects for the long haul.Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.

675,TTWO,"Activision Blizzard’s (ATVI  -  Free Report) Overwatch League had a scintillating start with more than 10 million viewers watching the event in the first week of the inaugural season.Worldwide fans of Overwatch viewed all the actions of the league through Twitch, MLG.com and the MLG app (on iOS and Android). The event was also available in the OverwatchLeague.com and the Overwatch League companion app.Moreover, Activision added Toyota to its list of sponsors which already includes the likes of Intel and Hewlett-Packard.The automotive manufacturer plans to have additional broadcast integrations and a vehicle presence at Blizzard Arena Los Angeles, where all the games of the inaugural season are scheduled.The first season of the Overwatch League will run until June, with playoffs and finals scheduled for July. Activision Blizzard, Inc Price and Consensus  Activision Blizzard, Inc Price and Consensus | Activision Blizzard, Inc Quote Overwatch: Key Catalyst in 2018     Shares of Activision surged 5.6% since the beginning of the Overwatch League (January 10). Activision’s shares have returned 83.1% in the past year, substantially outperforming industry’s rally of 48.2%.  We expect Activision to benefit from the massive viewership, expanding corporate sponsorships and growing media coverage of the Overwatch League.E-sports, which are live video game tournaments, are fast emerging as a lucrative business opportunity. Activision has long been undertaking efforts to build its presence in this arena.Apart from setting up an exclusive e-sports unit spearheaded by former ESPN CEO Steve Bornstein, the company acquired MLG, a leading e-sports organization for an estimated $46 million to boost its presence in the market.The massive viewership along with expanding sponsor-base provides Activision a competitive edge over the likes of Electronic Arts (EA  -  Free Report) and Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO  -  Free Report). These companies are stepping up their efforts to match Activision’s growing dominance in the e-sports market.EA partnered with the National Football League (NFL) to organize the Madden NFL Club Championship. In February 2017, Take Two inked a deal with NBA to launch NBA 2K eLeague, which will be functional in 2018.Portfolio Strength to Drive GrowthMoreover, Activision’s strong innovative portfolio that includes offerings like StarCraft, World of Warcraft, Diablo, Hearthstone, Heroes of the Storm, Call of Duty: WWII and Destiny 2 will drive growth in the near term.According to NPD, GfK/GSD and Activision’s internal estimates (through October 2017), Call of Duty: WWII and Destiny 2 were the #1 and #2 top-selling console video game of the year, respectively, in North America.Activision anticipates fourth-quarter 2017 non-GAAP revenues and earnings to be $1.7 billion and 36 cents per share, respectively.

676,TTWO,"Welcome to the latest episode of Full-Court Finance, the podcast from Zacks Investment Research focused on the intersection of sports, business, and the stock market. On this week’s episode, we explore the growing international business of the NBA at the halfway point of the 2017-18 season.Last season, NBA attendance hit a new high for the third year in a row. This year, television ratings are up as much as 25% on ESPN and TNT, while the NFL’s linear TV struggles draw near-constant headlines.The NBA’s multibillion-dollar media rights deals with Disney (DIS  -  Free Report) and Time Warner  helped lift the league’s salary cap almost single-handedly. The league also tipped off its new Nike (NKE  -  Free Report) jersey sponsorship deal this season, which not only marked a 245% increase from the previous deal with Adidas (ADDYY  -  Free Report), but also led the NBA to add sponsorship patches on jerseys for the first time.Japanese tech power Rakuten RKUNY reportedly shelled out $20 million per year to sponsor the Golden State Warriors, while the likes of Goodyear (GT  -  Free Report), General Electric (GE  -  Free Report), Fitbit (FIT  -  Free Report), eBay’s (EBAY  -  Free Report) online ticket giant StubHub have also jumped on the first major U.S. jersey sponsorship deal.Meanwhile, at a time when the average NFL and MLB fan is getting older, the NBA has been able to keep the average age of its fans down. This has been driven in part by a push on social media, where the NBA outpaces the NFL on both Twitter (TWTR  -  Free Report) and Instagram (FB  -  Free Report) in terms of followers.The league also recently announced a new partnership with Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) Twitch streaming service as it explores the possibilities of a streaming future. What’s more, through a partnership with Take-Two Interactive (TTWO  -  Free Report), the NBA is set to become the first major North American professional sport with its own esports league later this year.The league and its management have also focused a lot of resources to expand the NBA outside of the U.S., and this effort has helped the NBA become increasingly popular in the world’s second-largest economy, China. But the NBA’s popularity in China might just be heating up as the league continues its attempt to become an expanding global sports powerhouse. If you have any questions about this episode of Full-Court Finance please feel free to shoot us an email over at podcast@zacks.com.

677,TTWO,"Shares of Activision Blizzard (ATVI  -  Free Report) surged to a new all-time high on Thursday after the video gaming powerhouse debuted its new “Overwatch” esports league to much fanfare on Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) live-streaming site Twitch on Wednesday night.The inaugural matches of the regular season of the 12-team Overwatch league kicked off yesterday. Fans were able to take in the three-match slate on Twitch, Major League Gaming platforms, as well as OverwatchLeague.com and its new app.Overwatch team owners reportedly paid $20 million to purchase franchises. Ownership groups include Robert Kraft, owner of the New England Patriots, along with other owners of mainstream U.S. professional sports franchises (also read: Esports is The Next Billion Dollar Industry: 3 Stocks to Watch).Esports have been on the rise for the last few years, but Activision Blizzard’s Overwatch league is one of the first major tests of a model similar to that of other professional sports. In the first season, the league features 12 city-based teams split into two divisions.Teams from Los Angeles, Dallas, London, Shanghai, Seoul, and other major metropolitan areas are set to compete in the six-month regular season that runs from Jan. 10 until June 16. A postseason and an all-star weekend are also scheduled.Game days currently feature three different head-to-head matchups a night. Teams are set to play twice a week during a slate of games that run Wednesday through Saturday nights.The Overwatch league’s long and packed schedule, with an array of different viewing options for fans, should give Activision Blizzard the chance to cash in from advertisers.

According to market research firm Newzoo, the average esports fan is between 21 and 35, which is a highly sought after advertising democratic—and much younger than the NFL and MLB’s audience on average. On top of that, the firm projected that around 191 million people around the world would watch at least one esports competition a month in 2017.Activision Blizzard stock surged over 3% to reach a new all-time high of nearly $69 per share on Thursday, as investors seem pleased with the prospect of a potentially massively popular world-wide esports league. Before today’s climb, shares of Activision Blizzard had soared over 70% in the last 52-weeks.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

680,TTWO,"Electronic Arts Inc (EA  -  Free Report) has been in the news since the messed-up launch of its highly anticipated game, Star Wars Battlefront 2 last week.Released on Nov 17, Battlefront has received mostly okayish kind of reviews but apparently it was the outrage over the exorbitant pricing of in-games purchases that compelled EA to temporarily turn off all micro transactions in the game. EA’s shares have lost 1.1% of their value since Nov 17.EA’s move to stall in-game micro transactions has found support from The Walt Disney Company's (DIS  -  Free Report) Lucasfilm, the production company behind Star Wars. The Washington Post quoted Lucasfilm saying, “Star Wars has always been about the fans--and whether it's Battlefront or any other Star Wars experience, they come first. That's why we support EA's decision to temporarily remove in-game payments to address fan concerns.""Electronic Arts Inc. Revenue (TTM) Electronic Arts Inc. Revenue (TTM) | Electronic Arts Inc. QuoteIn a SEC filing, EA said that the removal of in-game purchases will not impact fiscal 2018 guidance. EA also added that the in-game purchases will be available at a later date.However, an analyst with KeyBanc Capital Markets said that the anger was exaggerated. He was quoted by CNBC saying “Gamers aren't overcharged, they're undercharged (and we're gamers). … This saga has been a perfect storm for overreaction as it involves EA, Star Wars, reddit, and certain purist gaming journalists/outlets who dislike MTX.""He further added, “If you take a step back and look at the data, an hour of video game content is still one of the cheapest forms of entertainment. Quantitative analysis shows that video game publishers are actually charging gamers at a relatively inexpensive rate, and should probably raise prices.”Electronic Arts found tremendous success with Star Wars Battlefront. Battlefront sold 14 million copies in fiscal 2016. Given this, it was widely expected that Battlefront 2 sales will also be somewhat around that mark. However, this controversy has been a dampener and analysts expect sales to be lower than its predecessor.Given the controversy, month to date, shares are down over 10%. Year to date, shares are up 37% but have underperformed the 48.2% rally seen in the industry.Currently, Electronic Arts has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Stocks to ConsiderBetter-ranked stocks in the video game space are Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.

681,TTWO,"Momentum investing is built on the belief that once a trend is established, it is more likely to continue in that direction than to reverse the trend. Overall, the current bull market has been a momentum investor’s dream, and this belief has been confirmed by our major indexes, which have broken into new highs several times this year.As 2017 starts to wrap up, an optimistic global economy and strong earnings growth seem to indicate that our long-running bull market will continue. There are certainly a number of domestic and international political sagas that could threaten this bullishness, but until our fundamental picture changes, stocks should keep surging.With that said, it’s time for investors to focus in on strong momentum stocks that have continued to test new highs. Luckily, our proven Zacks Rank works in conjunction with these specific stock trends, and our Style Scores system includes a “Momentum” category that highlights these surging stocks.Today we have highlighted three stocks that are all currently sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and a Momentum grade of “A.” Check out these three momentum stocks to buy now:1.       Take-Two Interactive (TTWO  -  Free Report)Thanks to strong digital revenues, Take-Two has emerged as 2017’s hottest video game stock. Shares are up over 134% year-to-date, and TTWO is continually testing new highs. What’s more, strong guidance has led to rising earnings estimates, a strong Zacks Rank, and impressive growth projections. For Take-Two’s upcoming fiscal year, our consensus estimates are calling for EPS growth of 67% and sales growth of 40%. If those estimates hold up, it won’t be long until TTWO is skyrocketing into new highs. 2.       Deutsche Lufthansa AG The struggles of the domestic airline industry have been well-documented, but foreign carriers like Lufthansa have actually been soaring recently. In fact, the stock is up more than 143% in 2017 alone. On top of its strong Zacks Rank and impressive momentum, DLAKY is also sporting an “A” grade for Value. With a Forward P/E ratio of 7.09 and a TTM P/S ratio of 0.39, the stock is trading at a discount compared to its industry average. While investors do inherent certain risks with airline stocks, DLAKY looks like a strong option for various reasons. 3.       STMicroelectronics NV (STM  -  Free Report)Semiconductor stocks have dominated the tech landscape this year, and companies like STMicroelectronics, which designs chips that are perfect for use in the Internet of Things, have led the pack. STM has gained more than 111% year-to-date and is showing no signs of slowing down. In fact, after a fiscal 2017 that is expected to finish with earnings growth of 200%, STM is expected to see EPS growth of 33% and sales growth of 10% next year. This could result in further share price gains, especially if STM can outperform these estimates. Want more stock market analysis from this author?

682,TTWO,"Snap Inc. (SNAP  -  Free Report) recently disclosed an investment by Shenzhen, China-based Tencent Holding Limited and its affiliates. Following the announcement, the Chinese game maker expressed its intention to help Snapchat in publishing video games on its platform and improving ad sales.Reuters quoted Tencent management saying, ""The investment enables Tencent to explore cooperation opportunities with the company on mobile games publishing and newsfeed as well as to share its financial returns from the growth of its businesses and monetization in the future.""We believe moving toward video games will be a positive for Snap, which has been experiencing a slowdown in its user base and revenue growth rates over the last few quarters.Notably, shares of Snap have lost 47.9% of its value since its listing date of Mar 2, 2017 against 17.9% growth of its industry.Mobile Games Hold Solid PotentialSnapchat’s association with Tencent, the leading gaming company in the world, will help it to bring popular games on its platform, which in turn will drive user growth.Per Newzoo, Riot Games’ (owned by Tencent) League of Legends is the United States and Europe’s most popular PC game.Despite strong demand for gaming consoles like Microsoft’s (MSFT  -  Free Report) Xbox One, Sony’s PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch, we note that mobile games have become one of the fastest growing segments in the video game market.Newzoo projects mobile game revenues to grow in the range of 32% - 40% from 2017 - 2020. Per Newzoo, mobile gaming will be extremely lucrative and account for 42% of the total gaming market in 2017.Snapchat’s major rival Facebook Inc. (FB  -  Free Report) launched Instant Games on both Facebook and Messenger platforms last year. For Instant Games, Facebook collaborated with the likes of Bandai Namco, Konami, Zynga as well as Activision Blizzard’s King Digital Entertainment.Snapchat’s foray into the video game space might help it to overshadow the growing dominance of Instagram whose total addressable market (TAM) is three times that of Snap.Advertising Revenues – Primary ContributorAs advertising forms the mainstay of Snap’s revenues, a slowdown in user base growth rate may look unattractive to advertisers. This may dampen the company’s growth opportunities.In the last reported quarter, ad impressions witnessed a 400% year-over-year surge. However, management noted on the last conference call that the company’s transition to programmatic auction resulted in over 60% year-over-year decline in cost per thousand (CPM), which impacted advertising revenues. We believe the company will benefit from such an auctioning model in due course.The company’s investment in third-party measurement solution for advertisers has yielded positive results. Notably, Take-Two Interactive’s (TTWO  -  Free Report) video game publishing subsidiary, 2K benefited from Snap Ads and Lenses, which helped it to find out the demand for NBA 2K18 video game and its popularity among users.Snapchat’s new conversion tracking tool, Snap Pixel, to help advertisers measure traffic growth on their websites, is being tested. We believe once the feature is rolled out, it will help the company to attract advertisers.If the company can channel the investment from Tencent in the right direction, it may prove to be a key driver going ahead in our view.Snap Inc.

683,TTWO,"SeaWorld Entertainment, Inc. (SEAS  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 numbers on Nov 7, before the opening bell.Last quarter, the company pulled off a positive earnings surprise of 251.61%. Prior to that, this Florida-based theme park and entertainment company delivered negative earnings surprises in the trailing three quarters.SeaWorld Entertainment, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  SeaWorld Entertainment, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | SeaWorld Entertainment, Inc. QuoteNotably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter earnings is pegged at 79 cents, reflecting an increase of 2.6% over the prior-year quarter.    Generally, the second and the third quarters of each year are seasonally strong for SeaWorld. Therefore, the company expects the trend to continue in the to-be-reported quarter as it has come up with a robust lineup of products that include new rides and attractions. Meanwhile, SeaWorld is increasingly focusing on its marketing strategy to highlight brand attributes and new additions. All of these are expected to boost attendance in the quarter.However, California, Texas and Florida markets continue to witness a fall in attendance. Even promotional offerings have not been able to arrest the decline in traffic trends.Nevertheless, SeaWorld is making every possible effort to regain customers’ confidence. Evidently, it continues to organize consumer events to drive attendance. Additionally, extended hours at SeaWorld Parks, strategic season pass promotions and more such strategies are expected to offset the prevailing negatives to some extent and attract customers, thereby improving attendance.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for attendance in the third quarter of 2017 is pegged at 7,961, up more than 30% sequentially but down 4.6% year over year.We are optimistic about the company’s sincere efforts to control costs without harming efficiency and improve its financial standing through debt refinancing, which might help in improving margins in the to-be-reported quarter. The consensus estimate for third-quarter earnings is pegged at 79 cents, reflecting an increase of 2.6% over the prior-year quarterIn the meantime, SeaWorld’s total revenue per capita has been under pressure mostly due to lower attendance, especially from Latin American and the UK visitors. The company also believes that though Latin American visitation has been stabilizing, it will take a long time to return to its previous glorious levels. For the quarter, the consensus estimate for total revenue per capita is pegged at $57, down 1.7% year over year.Furthermore, it has launched tactical pricing initiatives at several of its locations. Thus, though the combination of direct price increases and dynamic pricing initiatives may somewhat drive admissions per capita in the quarter, ticket product and park mix issues might hamper the same. The consensus estimate for admissions per capita is pegged at $34.38, down 2.7% on a year-over-year basis.In fact, the consensus estimate for the quarter’s revenues is pegged at $455.3 million, reflecting a year over year decline of 6.2%.Additionally, costs related to marketing and reputation campaigns as well as investments in new attractions might hurt profits in the third quarter.Taking into account the headwinds, our quantitative model predicts that SeaWorld does not have the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.Zacks ESP: SeaWorld has an Earnings ESP of -2.11%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: SeaWorld carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).As it is we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Strong Sell) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies to consider as our model shows they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. (TTWO  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +3.97% and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Planet Fitness, Inc.

684,TTWO,"Investors seeking strong returns may allocate their assets in stocks with favorable liquidity positions. Liquidity is an important yardstick that indicates a company’s capability to meet debt obligations by converting assets into cash.A company with a favorable liquidity position always has the potential to provide higher returns as liquidity drives growth. However, one should exercise caution before investing in such stocks. While a high liquidity level may imply that the company is meeting its obligations at a faster rate compared to peers, it may also indicate that the company is failing to use its assets efficiently.Hence, one may consider the efficiency level of a company in addition to its liquidity to identify potential winners.Measures to Identify Liquid StocksLiquidity ratios like Current Ratio, Quick Ratio and Cash Ratio are primarily used to identify companies with strong liquidity.Current Ratio: It measures current assets relative to current liabilities. This ratio is used for measuring a company’s potential to meet both short- and long-term debt obligations. Thus, a current ratio – also known as working capital ratio – below 1 indicates that the company has more liabilities than assets. However, a high current ratio does not always indicate that the company is in good financial shape. It may also mean that the company has failed to utilize its assets significantly. Hence, a range of 1 to 3 is considered ideal.Quick Ratio: Unlike current ratio, quick ratio – also called “acid-test ratio"" or ""quick assets ratio"" – indicates a company’s ability to pay short-term obligations. It considers inventory excluding current assets relative to current liabilities. Like the current ratio, a quick ratio of greater than 1 is desirable.Cash Ratio: This is the most conservative ratio among the three, as it takes into account only cash and cash equivalents, and invested funds relative to current liabilities. It measures a company’s ability to meet its current debt obligations using the most liquid of assets. Though a cash ratio higher than 1 may point to sound financials, a high number may indicate inefficiency in using cash.So, a ratio greater than 1 is desirable at all times but may not always reflect the condition of a company’s financial health.Screening ParametersIn order to pick the best of the lot, we have added asset utilization, which is a widely used measure of a company’s efficiency, as one of the screening criteria. Asset utilization is a ratio of total sales over the past 12 months to the last four-quarter average of total assets. Though this ratio varies across industries, companies with a ratio higher than their respective industries can be considered efficient.In order to ensure that these liquid and efficient stocks have solid growth potential, we have added our proprietary Growth Style Score to the screen.Current Ratio, Quick Ratio and Cash Ratio between 1 and 3 (While liquidity ratios of greater than 1 are desirable, significantly high ratios may indicate inefficiency.)Asset utilization greater than industry average (Higher asset utilization than the industry average indicates a company’s efficiency.)Zacks Rank equal to #1 (Only Strong Buy-rated stocks can get through. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.) Growth Style Score less than or equal to B (Back-tested results show that stocks with a Growth Style Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 handily beat other stocks.)These criteria have narrowed down the universe of over 7,700 stocks to only eight.Here are four of the eight stocks that qualified the screen:Tampa, FL-based WellCare Health Plans Inc. (WCG  -  Free Report) is a leading managed care company. It primarily focuses on providing government-sponsored managed care services. The company has a Growth Style Score of A and an average four-quarter positive earnings surprise of 64.34%. Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 earnings has climbed by $1.03 per share to $8.04 over the last 30 days.The Boston Beer Company Inc. (SAM  -  Free Report), based in Boston, MA, is among the leading craft brewers in the domestic market. The company has a Growth Style Score of B and an average four-quarter positive earnings surprise of 63.35%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 earnings has risen by 51 cents a share to $6.08 over the last 30 days.San Jose, CA-based Adobe Systems Inc. (ADBE  -  Free Report) is one of the largest software companies in the world. The company has a Growth Style Score of B and an average four-quarter positive earnings surprise of 7.80%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 earnings has remained steady at $4.20 per share over the last 30 days.Based in New York City, Take Two Interactive Software Inc (TTWO  -  Free Report) is a leading developer and publisher of video games and peripherals. The company has a Growth Style Score of B and an average four-quarter positive earnings surprise of 107.07%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 earnings has increased by a couple of cents to $2.21 per share over the last 30 days.Get the rest of the stocks on the list and start putting this and other ideas to the test.

In September 2017, Epic Games introduced a BR mode for Fortnite on computers and gaming consoles.Call of Duty: Activision’s Cash CowCall of Duty is one of the biggest growth drivers for Activision. Notably, Call of Duty: World War II was the top-selling console video game in 2017 globally.In the last reported quarter, Activision garnered 51 million monthly active users (MAUs) up 12% sequentially. This increase can primarily be attributed to Call of Duty: WWII, Destiny 2 and Crash Bandicot.Revenues (including deferrals) of $1.38 billion surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.32 billion.

Additionally, strong quarterly revenue projections from Take-Two Interactive Software also boosted investor sentiment. However, concerns remained over the timing and implementation of Trump’s tax cut plans after Republicans lost elections to the governorship of Virginia and New Jersey on Tuesday.

688,TTWO,"Match Group, Inc. (MTCH  -  Free Report) is set to report third-quarter 2017 earnings results on Nov 8.The company went public in November 2015 and in its first earnings announcement, as a publicly-traded company, Match Group had missed earnings estimates by 5.3%.The succeeding quarters proved to be slightly better, as the company’s earnings beat estimates twice for as many misses in the trailing four quarters, for a modest average positive surprise of 3.4%. Last quarter, it missed estimates by 15.8%.However, we anticipate Match Group to score an earnings beat in the to-be-reported quarter.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Match Group has the right combination of the two key ingredients. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is perfectly the case here as you will see below:Zacks ESP: Match Group has an Earnings ESP of +6.29%,as the Most Accurate estimate of 23 cents is pegged above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 22 cents.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: The company carries a Zacks Rank of 2, which when combined with a positive ESP, makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Conversely, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Ranks #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.Factors Driving the Better-than-Expected ResultsMatch Group is the world’s foremost provider of dating products and operates a portfolio of more than 45 brands. Three of its biggest and best known brands are Match.com, OkCupid and Tinder. The company’s reputation, established user base and size are anticipated to prove to be favorable in the upcoming earnings.About 60% of the company’s revenues come directly from users of its dating services in North America, mostly in the form of membership subscriptions. Online dating has been expanding, as users from more demographics join the fray. Most of Match Group’s users connect from mobile devices, where conversion to paid members is also higher. Last quarter, its average PMC (paid-member count) rose 15% year over year, driven by solid contribution from Tinder, PlentyOfFish, Pairs and OkCupid. This momentum bodes well for the company’s top-line growth in the quarter under review.Match Group has been reaping profits for the past three years and recording top-line growth as well. The company is currently enjoying strong growth, driven by robust growth momentum at Tinder, solid performances from Meetic and Match, as well as the recently acquired — PlentyOfFish.Match Group, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Match Group, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Match Group, Inc. QuoteMatch Group recently rolled out a Tinder Gold subscription package, which is anticipated to drive incremental ARPPU as well as incremental PMC. Early results of the service are very promising, and it should benefit the results of the quarter under review.In the last quarterly report, Match Group had given its revenue projections for third-quarter 2017 in the range of $322-$332 million (reflecting 14% year-over-year growth at the mid-point), with an adjusted EBITDA of $110-$115 million for the quarter.However, a slight delay in launching Tinder Gold globally and weaker-than-expected ad revenue growth trends might dent the company’s top line in this quarter. Further, profits might be impacted due to higher investments in Tinder, which are also driving higher-than-expected data costs.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. (TTWO  -  Free Report), with an Earnings ESP of +5.69% and a Zacks Rank of 1, is expected to release quarterly numbers around Nov 7.

689,TTWO,"Large Caps vs. Small CapsU.S. small-caps have been continuously lagging their large-cap counterparts this year. Large-cap stocks have been growing on stepped-up global economy, owing to their high international exposure. Small-cap stocks on the other hand are more domestically focused and exhibit higher volatility than their large-cap counterparts.The largest small-cap ETF tracking the Russell 2000 index, iShares Russell 2000 ETF is up 10.7% so far this year, while the SPDR S&P 500 ETF is up about 15%.The primary reason for this underperformance can be attributed to investors piling onto blue chips and shunning the small-caps. However, with robust domestic economic growth and rising hopes of President Donald Trump’s tax reform, small-cap stocks are expected to perform well.Economic DataU.S. equities have been rallying owing to multiple factors. GDP increased 3% annually in the July-September period compared with a 3.1% increase in the third quarter. Also, it surpassed expectations of a 2.5% increase (read: 5 ETFs to Soar After Solid Q3 GDP Data).Trump is expected to announce his decision on the Federal Reserve chair this week. Markets believe that Trump is expected to choose Fed governor Jerome Powell as Janet Yellen’s replacement. Powell is being seen as a dovish candidate who will not steer much from the current Fed policy. Markets widely expect the Fed to hike rates in its December meeting.On Oct 19, the Senate passed a budget of $4 trillion in a 51-49 vote which will allow the Republicans to move ahead with the tax cuts with a simple majority instead of the 60-vote supermajority that is generally required (read: GOP Nears Tax Reform: Buy These ETFs).The tax reform is expected to significantly boost earnings. This led to a rally in the stock markets as investors grew more optimistic about Trump delivering on his campaign promises. Moreover, it will significantly boost the performance of small-caps owing to their domestic focus.However, the markets are worried about the tax cuts rolling in gradually, instead of an immediate cut. This will be contrary to Trump’s wishes and markets’ expectation of an immediate cut.Let us now discuss a few ETFs focused on providing exposure to U.S. small-cap equities.iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM  -  Free Report)This fund seeks to provide exposure to small cap U.S. companies and tracks the Russell 2000 index.It has AUM of $43.6 billion and charges a fee of 20 basis points a year.

On a year-over-year basis, net bookings were up 20%.Continued increase in digital revenues and strength in games like Grand Theft Auto V,Grand Theft Auto Online, NBA 2K17& 2K18, Monster Legends and XCOM 2 were the driving factors. Recurrent consumer spending net bookings increased 84% and represented 42% of total net bookings.Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. QuoteThe company's net revenues came in at $443.6 million, higher than $420.2 million reported in the year-ago period.Per the company, digital revenues (68% of total revenue) increased 31.3% to $302.9 million while revenues from Physical retailer and other segments (32% of total revenue) were down 25.7% to $140.7 million.Region-wise, revenues from the United States (62% of total revenue) were up 9.3% to $276 million. International markets revenues were flat at $167.6 million.Given the strong performance of Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, NBA 2K17, WWE2K17, XCOM2 and WWE: SuperCard, digitally-delivered net sales (68% of total net revenue) were up 31% to $302.9 million.MarginsTake Two’s gross margin was 44.4%, compared with 51.1% reported in the prior-year quarter.Loss from operations was $11.3 million, compared with income from operations of $47.2 million reported in the prior-year quarter.Balance Sheet and Cash FlowAs of Sep 30, 2017, Take Two had $1.26 billion in cash and short-term investments, compared with $1.39 billion as of Mar 31, 2017. During the first six months of fiscal 2018, net cash used in operating activities was $1.1 million.OutlookTake Two provided guidance for the third quarter and fiscal 2018. Strength in franchises like Grand Theft Auto, NBA 2K and WWE 2K will boost the top line in the fiscal year, despite a light slate of new releases along with Social Point.The company has pushed the release of its much-anticipated Red Dead Redemption 2 from fall of 2017 to spring of 2018. Earlier this year, Take Two acquired the popular simulation game, Kerbal Space Program. A new Kerbal game, Kerbal Space Program: Making History Expansion, is also slated for launch this year.For the third quarter, the company expects net bookings to be in the band of $610–$660 million. GAAP net revenues are projected in the band of $440–$490 million.The company projects operating expenses to be in the range of $220 million to $230 million, up 16% at mid point due to higher acquisition costs as well as higher R&D expenses. The company projects GAAP loss per share in the range of 25–35 cents.For fiscal 2018, net bookings are projected in the band of $1.93–$2.03 billion, compared with $1.65–$1.75 billion.

The company now projects earnings per share in the range of 55–80 cents compared with $1.00–$1.25 projected earlier.Our TakeThe company continues to benefit from its popular offerings like Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online, along with its other releases like NBA 2K and WWE 2K. In fact, higher sales of the digital version of the games add to the company’s margins. Take Two continues to expect growth in digital revenues, driven by higher sales of full game downloads and increase in recurrent consumer spending.The company recently forayed into the free-to-play games space with the acquisition of game developer, Social Point. The acquisition will help it to boost its performance, going ahead. Management expects Social Point to contribute 5% of the net bookings in the current fiscal.Nonetheless, stiff competition from other game makers such as Activision Blizzard Inc. (ATVI  -  Free Report), Electronic Arts (EA  -  Free Report) and Glu Mobile Inc. (GLUU  -  Free Report) remains a major concern.Currently, Take Two carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

692,TTWO,"MGM Resorts International (MGM  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 numbers on Nov 8, before the opening bell.Last quarter, the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings owing to an improvement in revenues. Also, MGM Resorts has a decent earnings surprise history.Evidently, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 161.64%.MGM Resorts International Price and EPS Surprise  MGM Resorts International Price and EPS Surprise | MGM Resorts International QuoteHowever, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter earnings of 33 cents reflects a year-over-year decline of 43.1%.Also, a look at the company’s price performance shows that it underperformed the industry. Shares of MGM Resorts have gained around 2.8% in the last six months, underperforming the industry’s growth of 15.6%.Will the upcoming earnings release give a boost to MGM Resorts’ stock? Well, this depends largely on whether the firm is able to post a beat in the third quarter.Our quantitative model predicts that MGM Resorts does not have the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.Zacks ESP: MGM Resorts has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: MGM Resorts has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).  As it is we caution you against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Strong Sell) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Factors Likely to Affect Q3 ResultsPer the Macau Gaming Inspection and Coordination Bureau, gross gaming revenues increased in all the three months of the quarter, thereby continuing the revival in Macau. This, in turn, is likely to boost revenues at MGM China in the third quarter.Despite significant improvement in the VIP market, the company’s VIP business has been largely struggling and this may weigh on MGM China’s results. Increased competition from new openings in Cotai may further hamper the company’s market share and business in the quarter and result in underperformance at MGM China.Meanwhile, higher demand at its properties in Las Vegas on the back of improving employment rate trends and increasing tourism numbers in the region are expected to propel results. However, higher-than-normal table games hold and solid revenue per available room (RevPAR) growth at Las Vegas Strip resorts in prior-year quarter is set to provide tough year-over-year comparisons in the third quarter.Moreover, higher than anticipated disruption at Monte Carlo as the property undergoes its transformation to Park MGM is likely to hamper results. In fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the property’s revenues is pegged at $68 million, reflecting a decrease of 6.8% on a year-over-year basis.Nevertheless, given its strong event calendar, the company expects Las Vegas Strip revenues in the third quarter to increase slightly, with its strip RevPAR expected to improve 2-3%. Additionally, the diversification of its resort portfolio and non-gaming options is likely to boost the top line. Notably, the consensus estimate for the quarter’s revenues is pegged at $2.77 billion, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 10.2%.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies to consider as our model shows they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.

This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for TTWO, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +3.97% heading into earnings season.Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.

694,TTWO,"Per media reports, Nintendo Co Ltd (NTDOY  -  Free Report) is set to unveil its third smartphone game (both iOS and Android) namely Animal Crossing – Pocket Camp this November end. Two of its other games launched for the mobile platform include Super Mario Run and Fire Emblem Heroes.It is free-to-play game and the company looks to make money through in-game transactions. Analysts observe this game to be Nintendo’s big bet in the mobile gaming space.Bloomberg quoted a Goldman Sachs Group Inc analyst saying that Nintendo could earn double the revenues than the total collective sales of its earlier two mobile games. Meanwhile, a Citigroup analyst estimated in April that (assuming the game will have 18 million users) the game could generate 4 billion yen in sales in the current fiscal year.Nintendo Co. Price Nintendo Co. Price | Nintendo Co. QuoteAfter remaining aloof for quite some time now, Nintendo has been focusing on growing its footprint in the smartphone games arena. Analysts observe that Nintendo was trying to protect its console business by not letting its well-known characters like Mario and Zelda appear on mobile platforms. However, mobile games started emerging as a lucrative business option as titles like Candy Crush and Angry Birds caught the imagination of the world.Video games will generate a whopping $108.9 billion in revenues in 2017, up 7.8% year over year, per the latest report from Newzoo. Mobile games revenues will grow 19% to $46.1 billion, representing 42% of the total revenue. By 2020, more than 50% of the revenues will come from mobile games.Pokémon Go’s success gave it the much needed impetus. Though the success of the game didn’t directly benefit Nintendo’s financials, we believe that it has strengthened the Japanese video game publisher’s position in the lucrative mobile games space. It was created by Niantic in association with Nintendo. Consequently, most of the benefit was netted by Niantic.Nintendo launched the first game in the Animal Crossing franchise in 2001. It is a game in which players move to villages and live with the animals (anthropomorphic) and carry out a variety of tasks. The game has garnered a positive response and reportedly has sold over 30 million copies (4 major games and 2 spin off games).Currently, Nintendo carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). We note that Nintendo has massively outperformed the industry in the past year. While the stock has returned 87.7%, the industry gained 45.1%.Key PicksOther stocks worth considering in the video game space include Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc (TTWO  -  Free Report), Electronic Arts Inc (EA  -  Free Report) and Glu Mobile Inc.

695,TTWO,"Wynn Resorts, Limited (WYNN  -  Free Report) is slated to report third-quarter 2017 numbers on Oct 26, after market close. Its revenues and earnings are expected to grow year over year.Last quarter, the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings owing to a substantial improvement in revenues.Notably, Wynn Resorts has a decent earnings surprise history. The company’s trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise is a positive 11.35%.Wynn Resorts, Limited Price and EPS Surprise  Wynn Resorts, Limited Price and EPS Surprise | Wynn Resorts, Limited QuoteAlso, a look at the company’s price performance reveals that it outperformed the industry year to date. Shares of Wynn Resorts have gained around 67.5% compared with the industry’s growth of 26%.Will the stock keep rallying post third-quarter earnings release? It majorly depends on whether it is able to maintain its earnings momentum.Our proven model shows that Wynn Resorts has the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase the odds of an earnings beat in the this quarter. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at +1.94%. This is a major indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise.Zacks Rank: Wynn Resorts’ Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) when combined with a positive ESP makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Moreover, Wynn Resorts’ business activities and prospects encouraged analysts to revise earnings estimates recently. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.37 for the just-concluded quarter has moved up 9.6% over the last 30 days. Additionally, it reflects a year-over-year improvement of a solid 82.1%.Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues of $1.56 billion for the to-be-reported quarter reflects year-over-year growth of 40.6%.Factors Likely to Affect Q3 ResultsPer Macau’s Gaming Inspection and Coordination Bureau (“DICJ”), gross gaming revenues (GGR) rose in all the three months of the quarter. This, in turn, indicates that the casino hub is firmly on its path to recovery. In fact, Macau’s VIP numbers is reported to have witnessed 35% expansion in the quarter, with VIP baccarat leading the surge of casino GGR.Thus, we expect Wynn Resorts’ consistent efforts to boost tourism and traffic in Macau to bolster third-quarter performance aided by the improved operating environment therein.Particularly, the company’s full-scale integrated resort in Cotai, Wynn Palace, continues to attract visits by tourists and leisure gamblers and should thus scoop up the quarter’s revenues. Provision of better non-gaming options might further propel results in the to-be-reported quarter.Meanwhile, the company’s properties in Las Vegas are likely to continue to cash in on the positive trends of improving employment rate and increasing tourism numbers in the region, thereby boosting the quarter’s top- and bottom¬-line growth.However, stringent capital controls by the Chinese government and increased audits of the junket industry by DICJ in order to stop money laundering might have somewhat restricted gaming revenues in Macau. Also, higher promotional allowances and distribution of higher incentives in the slots as well as in the mass market to hold market share might hamper the quarter’s profitability.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some other companies to consider as our model shows they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. (TTWO  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.94% and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Penn National Gaming, Inc.

696,TTWO,"Waste management firm Stericycle, Inc. (SRCL  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results after the closing bell on Nov 8. The company is likely to report lower revenues in Regulated Waste and Compliance Services segment that accounts for more than half of total revenues, due to stiff industry-wide competition.This is likely to result in lower earnings for the quarter.Top-Line WoesStericycle operates in a highly-competitive market. The barriers to entry into the regulated waste collection and disposal business and the pharmaceutical returns business are very low. Competitors also resort to aggressive pricing to gain market share. In the past, the company was forced to reduce prices for large-quantity account (hospitals, blood banks and pharmaceutical manufacturers) customers due to competitive pressures. This trend is likely to be seen in the impending quarterly results as well.Moreover, the Healthcare Reform Act might have a material adverse effect in the to-be-reported quarter. In addition, customers have also joined Group Purchasing Organizations and Integrated Delivery Networks to reduce costs through economies of scale. Changing regulations further impose new compliance requirements on Stericycle, alter its current method of doing business, and ultimately increase costs and compress margins. All these are likely to reduce the profitability of the company and impact earnings.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Regulated Waste and Compliance Services segment revenues is currently pegged at $508 million, down from $520.4 million reported in the year-ago quarter. Revenues from the Manufacturing and Industrial Services segment are anticipated to remain flat at $96 million. However, revenues from the Secure Information Destruction Services segment are expected to be $202 million compared with reported revenues of $187.1 million in the year-earlier quarter.Other Key FactorsA significant portion of Stericycle’s growth was due to the successful integration of acquisitions in both domestic and international markets. The company is continuously on the lookout for strategic acquisitions that will grow its market share and expand geographic base. However, the acquisition binge is leading to higher overheads and integration-related expenses, which are weighing on margins. A decline in the availability of potential acquisition candidates could adversely impact the company’s growth rate. Furthermore, many acquisitions have lower gross margins and higher selling, general and administrative expenses that often negate the positives.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Stericycle is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it does not possess the key components. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here as you will see below:Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and Zacks Consensus Estimate, is -0.32%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Stericycle, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Stericycle, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Stericycle, Inc.

697,TTWO,"Global cruise vacation company, Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. (RCL  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 numbers on Nov 7, before the opening bell.Last quarter, the company pulled off positive earnings surprise of 2.40%. In fact, Royal Caribbean’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters, with an average beat of 3.52%.Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. Price and EPS Surprise Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. Price and EPS Surprise | Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. QuoteNotably, this cruise operator’s shares have soared 63.6% in a year’s time, outperforming the industry’s 31.7% gain.Given the strength and diversity of its brands and itineraries, Royal Caribbean has successfully captured the potential and repeat cruise vacationers. Moreover, strong booking and demand trends along with various profit-generating initiatives (particularly its Double-Double program) are expected to drive the quarter’s top- and bottom-line performance.Markedly, the company’s bookings continue to be very robust as Royal Caribbean is benefiting from its global sourcing model, revenue management strategies and the price integrity program.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in the to-be-reported quarter is pegged at $3.43, reflecting an increase of 7.1% over the prior-year quarter. Additionally, the quarter’s revenues are anticipated to improve 0.5% year over year to $2.58 billion.Other Factors Likely to Affect Q3 ResultsWhile Royal Caribbean’s capacity growth is likely to aid in meeting increased demand, ship innovation and technology investments are expected to lead to higher yields. Per management, net yields are projected to increase in the range of 4.5-5%. Notably, solid demand trends for Europe and North America products are anticipated to drive improvement over an already strong previous year.  In fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter’s net yields reflect a rise of nearly 5% year over year.Furthermore, the company’s sailings in the Caribbean, Alaska and Asia-Pacific itineraries are likely to deliver strong results in the to-be-reported quarter. Meanwhile, increased investments in the Chinese cruise market are anticipated to further bolster the quarter’s results.However, lingering global uncertainties in key operating regions might limit revenue growth. Also, continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus the company’s basket of currencies is expected to hurt profits in the quarter. An increase in fuel prices may further hamper the company’s performance.Moreover, higher-than-anticipated load factors, timing and investment in revenue-generating activities are adding to the company’s costs. Net cruise costs (NCC), excluding fuel, are likely to be up about 4% to 4.5%. This increase in the cost metric primarily reflects year-over-year capacity reduction for the quarter. The consensus estimate for NCC, excluding fuel, also reflects a rise of 4%.Taking into account the headwinds, our quantitative model predicts that Royal Caribbean does not have the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.Zacks ESP: Royal Caribbean has an Earnings ESP of -1.10%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Royal Caribbean carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we also need a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings beat.Conversely, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are a couple of stocks, which as per our model have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.

700,TTWO,"Quanta Services, Inc. (PWR  -  Free Report) is slated to report third-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Nov 2.Quanta Services has had a dismal earnings surprise history, with three misses and one in-line earnings over the trailing four quarters, for an average negative surprise of 4.5%. Last quarter, the company’s earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 7.4%.However, we expect Quanta Services to score an earnings beat in the to-be-reported quarter.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Quanta Services has the right combination of the two key ingredients. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is perfectly the case here as you will see below:Zacks ESP: Quanta Services has an Earnings ESP of +1.05%, as the Most Accurate estimate of 60 cents is pegged above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 59 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: The company carries a Zacks Rank of 3, which when combined with a positive ESP, makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Conversely, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Ranks #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.Factors Driving the Better-than-Expected ResultsQuanta Services has been deriving sturdy benefits from the company’s diligent three-pronged growth strategy. The strategy focuses on the timely delivery of projects, leveraging on its core business areas to expand in complementary service lines and venturing into new service lines as well.Quanta Services’ thriving engineering and project management services are anticipated to bolster its revenues for the soon-to-be-reported quarter. Of late, the company has been witnessing a solid rebound in its end markets, on the back of key growth drivers, like an aging grid, shifting generation mix and implementation of clean energy initiatives. These factors will likely boost the segment’s top line.Moreover, the company is currently pursuing several high-voltage electric transmission award opportunities, amid substantial bidding activity, in Australia, Canada and the United States, which would reflect in the upcoming quarterly results. Quanta Services, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Quanta Services, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Quanta Services, Inc. QuoteQuanta Services raised its 2017 earnings and revenues guidance last quarter, and we believe its optimism stems from healthy backlog levels, which are anticipated to benefit the results in the to-be-reported quarter. Upbeat industry trends will act as major growth catalysts for the quarter to be reported.This apart, the company is likely to benefit directly from increasing U.S. production of liquid fuels. Also, Quanta Services wins more construction and engineering contracts as the performance and production levels of the energy sector increase. Robust pipeline projects in the oil and gas sector, supported by active bidding and negotiating environment, can also act as huge profit churners for the top line in the third quarter.In addition, Quanta Services’ previously completed acquisitions are likely to contribute significantly to the Electric Power Infrastructure Services segment’s top line. Particularly, the recent Stronghold acquisition will drive the company’s revenues with increased penetration in downstream and midstream petrochemical markets, which, in turn, will be beneficial for the quarter under review.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.

701,TTWO,"Melco Resorts & Entertainment Limited (MLCO  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Nov 2, before the opening bell. Its revenues and earnings are expected to improve on a year-over-year basis.Last quarter, this developer, owner and operator of casino gaming and entertainment casino resort facilities in Asia, witnessed a negative earnings surprise of 20%. However, prior to that, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing three quarters, with an average beat of 108.75%.In fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter earnings is pegged at 19 cents, reflecting an increase of 46.2% over the prior-year quarter. Also, revenues are expected to improve 11.6% year over year to $1.29 billion.Notably, a look at the company’s price performance also reveals that it outperformed the industry year to date. Shares of Melco Resorts have gained around 48.7% compared with the industry’s growth of 24.7%. Will the stock keep rallying post third-quarter earnings release? It majorly depends on whether it is able to maintain its earnings momentum.Our quantitative model predicts that Melco Resorts does not have the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.Zacks ESP: Melco Resorts has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Melco Resorts carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company’s 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Conversely, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Factors Likely to Influence Q3 ResultsPer Macau’s Gaming Inspection and Coordination Bureau (“DICJ”), gross gaming revenues (GGR) rose in all the three months of the quarter. This, in turn, indicates that the casino hub is firmly on its path to recovery. In fact, Macau’s VIP numbers is reported to have witnessed 35% expansion in the quarter, with VIP baccarat leading the surge of casino GGR. We thus expect the company’s performance in the region to get a boost in the to-be-reported quarter.Meanwhile, better performance at the non-gaming segments like rooms and food and beverages are further expected to drive the quarter’s results. Notably, the company’s large-scale resorts provide distinctive lodging, entertainment and retail options, which appeals to a broader audience from around the region.Additionally, Melco Resorts’ cost-control efforts including effective management of marketing expenses are likely to drive third-quarter profits and margins. Markedly, the addition of new VIP tables at the company’s Studio City property is also aiding in delivering a broader product offering to a wider breadth of customers. This, in turn, is expected to continue driving increased profitability in the quarter.Management expects Philippines’ gaming industry to be supported by the country's robust economic growth and its expanding inbound tourism strategy. Thus, Melco’s Entertainment City property therein is poised to largely benefit from this growth.However, stringent capital controls by the Chinese government and increased audits of the junket industry by DICJ in order to stop money laundering might have somewhat restricted gaming revenues in Macau. This may weigh on the company’s quarterly results as well. Stocks to ConsiderHere are some other companies to consider as our model shows they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.
