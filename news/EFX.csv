1,EFX,"A former Equifax (EFX) executive has been charged by the Securities and Exchange Commission for allegedly dumping his stock after learning of the company's massive data breach.X Jun Ying, who was the chief information officer, is facing insider trading charges for selling shares before the consumer credit reporting agency announced the cybersecurity failure last summer, which affected 147.9 million Americans.Ying exercised all of his vested Equifax stock, then sold the shares, reaping proceeds of nearly $1 million. He was able to avoid $117,000 in losses due to the illegal trades, according to the SEC.The U.S. Attorney's Office has also announced parallel criminal charges against Ying.""As alleged in our complaint, Ying used confidential information to conclude that his company had suffered a massive data breach, and he dumped his stock before the news went public,"" Richard R. Best, director of the SEC's Atlanta regional office, said in a press release. ""Corporate insiders who learn inside information, including information about material cyber intrusions, cannot betray shareholders for their own financial benefit.""The SEC's complaint charges Ying with violating the antifraud provisions of federal securities laws and seeks disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.Equifax stock closed down 0.4% at 123.19 on the stock market today. TransUnion (TRU) edged up 0.1% to 58.35.IBD'S TAKE: Despite the outrage against the company now, a JPMorgan analyst said Equifax will probably be fine. Equifax, which was founded in 1899, collects information on more than 800 million individual consumers and more than 88 million businesses worldwide.The Atlanta firm is one ""Big Three"" credit agencies along with Experian and TransUnion.Three other Equifax executives had previously drawn attention for disclosing stock sales just days before the breach was made public.CFO John Gamble sold almost $950,000 worth of shares, and U.S. information solutions president, Joseph Loughran, sold shares worth about $685,000 on Aug. 1. Workforce solutions president, Rodolfo Ploder, sold stock worth more than $250,000 on Aug. 2. However, Equifax found that none of those executives knew about the breach when they sold their securities.The big breach began in mid-May, but was not observed until July 29, according to Equifax. But the company waited until Sept. 7 to publicly disclose the hack.As well as the American customers, information on up to 44 million British residents as well as 8,000 Canadian residents were also compromised. It is one of the biggest data breaches in history.There was also a breach in March 2017, which was reported on Sept. 18, 2017. According to Bloomberg, a person familiar with the breach said this intrusion may have been carried out by the same hackers who breached the company's systems in May.YOU MAY ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Still Bullish On Bitcoin?

2,EFX,"MFS Mid Cap Growth Fund (OTCIX) is flexing its muscles. After topping 69% of its midcap growth rivals tracked by Morningstar.com last year with a 26.29% return, the $3.1 billion portfolio is outpacing 86% of its peers with a 15.33% gain this year going into June 21.It's also topping the S&P 500's modest 4.46% advance. The fund's strong performance this year has been fueled by holdings that include such leading growth stocks as Abiomed (ABMD), Netflix (NFLX), Lululemon Athletica (LULU), TransUnion (TRU) and Five Below (FIVE).Gains this year by those stocks range from 30% by TransUnion to 104% by Netflix and 118% by Abiomed.Relative performance has ramped up for this growth fund this year as many holdings have posted solid financial results. ""The first quarter was particularly strong for us with many stocks reporting good earnings and an unusually low number of misses (in comparison to analysts' forecasts),"" co-manager Paul Gordon said.Solid stock picking has been another factor. The market tide is no longer rising, lifting all boats. ""Volatility in markets has picked up and correlations have dropped,"" Gordon said. ""There is more separation between winners and losers.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseAmid tighter monetary conditions, investors have gravitated mainly into stocks posting the most attractive earnings gains, he adds.In addition, Gordon and his colleagues Eric Fischman and Matthew Sabel aim to control risk. ""We construct the portfolio so no single sector, industry or security will be more than 500 or 600 basis points over or under our benchmark, the Russell Midcap Growth Index,"" Gordon said.The growth fund began its current stake in Abiomed in Q1. ""(It's) key driver is a heart pump called Impella, which is focused on an unserved part of the heart disease market,"" Gordon said. ""It has been extremely successful because it improves patient outcomes — fewer deaths, fewer re-hospitalizations — and lowers cost to the system.""Abiomed is only 10% penetrated in what they call their total addressable market, Gordon says. ""But that TAM could increase as they expand into other indications in the future,"" he added.Netflix's earnings per shares grew at a triple-digit pace in four of the past six quarters. ""With 125 million paying subscriber base, there's a significant long-term runway for that number to go higher, based on the number of people in the world paying for TV and connected to the internet,"" Gordon said.Also, Netflix share price — which set all-time highs above 400 in June — got a boost when the company demonstrated pricing power in a series of price hikes. ""What the market really liked was that there was no significant change in the number of people who unplugged because of price increases,"" Gordon said.IBD'S TAKE: Keep your eye on Netflix by checking in to IBD's online page devoted to news and analysis focused on the content provider.Athletic apparel maker Lululemon's quarterly EPS growth has accelerated, growing 3%, 19%, 33% and 72% the past four stanzas. Share price is up more than 60% so far this year. Are there that many people taking up yoga? Or is the stock's jump due to an increasing number of people who want to wear stylist exercise garb even when they are nowhere near a yoga studio? Or is it a combination of the two?The stock's uptrend is a recovery from the slide that occurred from mid-2016 to mid-2017. Gordon attributes it to getting past quality and assortment problems that weighed on company performance.""After several years of operational issues that distracted the company, they've come out strong on the innovation side, both in women's and men's apparel,"" Gordon said.The growth fund began to buy TransUnion in November after deciding to exit Equifax (EFX) in the wake of its data breach scandal. ""We think there is a need for their (credit reporting) product,"" Gordon said. ""We think the Equifax issues were isolated and that it's possible TransUnion could gain market share as a result.""The MFS team likes TransUnion in its own right. ""We believe TransUnion could have above-industry growth from innovation in its core credit (business) that will make credit decisions more accurate and thereby drive pricing,"" Gordon said.He also says the company should benefit from further penetration into the health care, auto and insurance markets, and from greater exposure to emerging markets.Five Below's price discounts and focus on a teen market help insulate it from the problems dogging many brick-and-mortar retailers. ""They are more isolated from the Amazon (AMZN) threat,"" Gordon said. ""Like other dollar-store or off-price concepts, they offer a treasure hunt to their younger skewed demographic. It also has one of the longest runways for store growth in all of retail.""The chain now operates more than 400 stores, ""and long-term they believe they could operate over 2,000,"" Gordon said. ""It will take longer than five years at their current rate of growth.""The chain benefited last year from strong sales of Fidget Spinners. Five Below posted strong comparable sales in its latest quarter, surprising investors who expected a letdown after the Fidget Spinner fad.

4,EFX,"After being dominated by small-cap stock funds the year before, the best large-cap mutual funds came back strong in the third annual IBD Best Mutual Funds 2018 Awards.Winning Best Mutual Funds Awards isn't easy. The best large-cap mutual funds don't just beat their index for one year. The same goes for the best midcap mutual funds and the best small-cap mutual funds. They need to beat the S&P 500 Index in the one-, three-, five-, and 10-year periods.IBD looked at funds at least 10 years old with at least $100 million in assets. Out of 661 large-cap mutual funds meeting those criteria, 92 beat the S&P 500 in all four periods. Of 231 midcap mutual funds, only 16 qualified. And out of 295 small-cap funds, just 17 took top honors.Large-cap mutual funds hold stocks with large market capitalization, which is derived by multiplying number of shares outstanding by the share price. Morningstar Inc. defines large caps as stocks in the top 70% the capitalization of U.S. stocky market. This means a market cap greater than $20 billion.Of the five best large-cap mutual funds capturing IBD awards in 2018, four are index funds. The only actively managed award winning fund is $5.3 billion Fidelity OTC (FOCPX), which took top place in the first Mutual Fund Awards. After a manager shake-up in September 2017, Sonu Kalra who ran the fund from 2005 to 2009, returned to co-run it.OTC is an aggressive growth stock fund that seeks capital appreciation. Kalra looks for companies with a strong franchise, a high bar that other companies must clear in order to compete, and strong management team aligned with shareholders.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""Larger companies are doing better because the global economy is doing better,"" said Kalra. ""If you look at the indicators over the past several months, they indicate the global economy will continue on that path.""The fund holds many of the top tech stocks like Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOG), the parent of Google, Amazon.com (AMZN), Facebook (FB), Tesla (TSLA), and Nvidia (NVDA).Kalra also likes video game maker Activision Blizzard (ATVI). He said there many revenue opportunities with game makers like Activision. With digital downloads, they get revenue immediately and don't share any with retail stores. Consumers also purchase upgrades while playing to enhance their chances of winning. In addition, they are moving the franchise onto smartphones and away from consoles to widen their audience. Video game makers are now building leagues where people watch players in stadiums. This brings in ticket sales, merchandise revenue, food and other revenue streams.Chip Reed the co-portfolio manager of the Eaton Vance Capital SMID-Cap Fund (EISMX) has been managing the fund since inception. He said the midcap range starts around $6 billion to $8 billion.He says he's more cautious on the economy these days and spends a lot of time looking, but not a lot of time buying.He likes credit rating agency TransUnion (TRU), which should benefit from the sell-off in Equifax (EFX). He said TransUnion upgraded its technology and has been aggressive about picking up market share.Fair Isaac (FICO), which takes the credit bureaus' data and makes your credit score, has been a home run for the fund.Markel (MKL) is a specialty insurance company that takes nonstandard, higher-risk policies that larger firms can't make money on. ""They've figured out how to make money by underwriting these policies. It's one of our favorites,"" said Reed.Among the best small-cap mutual funds is Virtus KAR Small Cap Growth (PXSGX). Todd Beiley, co-portfolio manager, said he looks for three things when buying a business, durable competitive barriers, a compelling opportunity he can understand and a price that makes sense. He doesn't find many. The fund only owns 28 stocks and most of them it's owned more than five years.""We try to find great businesses and sit on our hands as much as possible,"" said Beiley. It seems to be working. Last year the fund returned 37%. It also beat its benchmark, the Russell 2000 Growth Index, in all time periods, as well.Among Beiley's top picks is the Rightmove ADR.  This firm is the U.K.'s leading online listings website for residential properties. He said it's a very profitable company because it doesn't require a lot of capital to operate, it has about 80% market share, which gives it pricing power, and operating margins are greater than 70%. It also distributes excess cash flow back to shareholders as dividends and share buybacks.Fox Factory Holding (FOXF), a maker of high-performance suspension products for mountain bikes, off-road trucks and all-terrain vehicles, has more than a 50% market share in a specific product category where brand and reputation are very important, Beiley says.YOU MAY ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Read The Full IBD Best Mutual Funds Awards 2018 Special ReportHere's The List Of The Best Mutual Funds Award Winners By CategoryBest Mutual Funds: News, Performance Reports And Investing IdeasHow To Invest Like Fidelity Stock Gurus Will Danoff And John RothWhich Stocks Are The Best Mutual Funds Buying — And Selling?

5,EFX,"Four Equifax (EFX) executives did not commit insider trading when they sold shares of the credit-rating bureau in the days after it discovered a massive security breach, according to findings from a special committee that were released Friday.XThe committee, which was formed in September to investigate those trades, said that ""none of the four executives had knowledge of the incident when their trades were made, that pre-clearance for the four trades was appropriately obtained, that each of the four trades at issue comported with Company policy, and that none of the four executives engaged in insider trading.""The committee, composed of independent Equifax board members, found that CFO John Gamble, president of U.S. information relations Joseph Loughran, investor relations director Douglas Brandberg, and workforce solutions president Rodolfo Ploder first learned that ""a security issue was being investigated"" at various points in August after the sales occurred.The stock sales were the subject of a criminal investigation by the Justice Department, Bloomberg reported in September. The breach led to the departures of CEO Richard Smith and other executives.Suspicions of the trades were first raised after Equifax detailed the timing of the breach, which left more than 145 million U.S. consumers vulnerable to identity theft and left many feeling hopeless about their ability to protect their personal information.The company said that the data breach — in which hackers likely accessed Social Security and driver's license numbers, birth dates and addresses — likely occurred from mid-May through July, and that it discovered the intrusion on July 29.CFO John Gamble sold $946,374 worth of the company's stock on Aug. 1. Joseph Loughran also sold shares on that date. Ploder and Brandberg made their trades on Aug. 2. Equifax disclosed the breach to the public on Sept. 7.Equifax shares were down 0.2% at 108.70 on the stock market today and are more than 25% off their high reached before the hack was revealed.  Rival TransUnion (TRU) rose 0.8% to 53.86, a record close.IBD'S TAKE: Despite the outrage against the company now, a JPMorgan analyst said Equifax will probably be fine. Yum Brands' (YUM) Pizza Hut, Amazon's (AMZN) Whole Foods and Sonic (SONC) and Hyatt (H) are among the companies that have disclosed security breaches in recent weeks. According to an Ars Technica report last month, Equifax's site was being used to send out fake, malicious Flash updates.That news was ""just Reason No. 10,000 why consumers should assume their personal information is already out there and act accordingly,"" Matt Schulz, a senior industry analyst from CreditCards.com, said in an emailed statement at that time.RELATED:Sonic Discloses That Hackers Breached Customers' Credit CardsEquifax CEO Richard Smith Retires After Mass HackKey Question On Equifax Options Trade Is Who Initiated OrderEquifax Stock Sales Said To Be Focus Of U.S. Criminal Probe

The company will search for a permanent CEO.Equifax shares fell 2.45% to 102.52 just before the opening bell on the stock market today.

7,EFX,"Getting to the bottom of an Equifax (EFX) options trade that has reportedly piqued the interest of congressional investigators will require a determination that plagues anyone looking for villains in markets.Namely, who made the trade. Not the person's name, necessarily, but whether he came to the market as a buyer or a seller. Getting an answer will be key to telling if the transaction is evidence of illicit intent, or just another weirdly timed options trade that doesn't amount to anything.And while it's impossible to be definitive, a couple traders see signs it was the latter.The question is of extra consequence in Equifax, where data show a surge in bearish put contracts weeks before the credit-reporting firm disclosed a security breach that sent its stock down 35%. CNBC reported Wednesday that a House committee is seeking information on the trades, which Business Insider said could've grossed $10 million.An Equifax spokeswoman didn't respond to a telephone call seeking comments on the options trades. The reported probe is separate from a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation of stock sales by Equifax insiders before the Sept. 7 disclosure.One piece of data the panel will be interested in is whether volume in the options was initiated by buyers or sellers. While puts in their simplest form are wagers that a stock will fall, in the through-the-looking-glass world of derivatives markets, an equally important consideration is whether the trader was bullish or bearish when he entered the transaction.In short, someone who sold the put — that is, had a bearish view on the contract, as opposed to buying it — would not have made money in the subsequent Equifax rout. While ""selling a put"" sounds absurd — betting on a decline in an option that itself is a bet on a decline in a stock — it happens all the time. Traders do it when they're convinced a stock won't fall and want to pocket the price of the option.Establishing who makes and loses money on a given options trade is as much art as science. In the case of Equifax, data compiled by Bloomberg show that almost 2,700 puts changed hands on Aug. 21, the most for any day since 2005, including two blocks of 1,250 September $135 puts each. At the same time, some see evidence those contracts were ""sold"" — that is, a seller approached market makers and asked the options be ""written"" and purchased from him.What evidence? Mainly that the two blocks of options changed hands at 70 cents and 75 cents, or near the ""bid,"" the market price set by a buyer (the options had a bid/offer spread of 70/95 cents). Normally, when a seller initiates a transaction, he must do it at his counterparty's terms.""The size is definitely unusual given the average total daily volume below 50 contracts, but the trade details suggest an opening seller initiated the trade, so it's not quite the smoking gun that some other reports have suggested,"" Henry Schwartz, president of analytics firm Trade Alert wrote in an email. ""Based on implied volatility and the bid-offer spread at the time of the trade, it seems very clear the options were sold given the $0.70 and $0.75 execution prices.""A sold option could conceivably be part of a larger, bearish trade, such a short sale on the underlying stock, but there's little evidence that was the case here, said Peter Cecchini, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald.""Based on the reading of the tape we don't see any indication there was a stock portion to this,"" Cecchini said. ""It looks like it was a seller, and either way it didn't work out very well for whomever sold the put unless they closed it prior to the news, and doesn't look like that happened.""

8,EFX,"The U.S. Justice Department has opened a criminal investigation into whether top officials at Equifax (EFX) violated insider trading laws when they sold stock before the company disclosed that it had been hacked, according to people familiar with the investigation.Prosecutors are looking at the stock sales by Equifax Chief Financial Officer John Gamble; President of U.S. Information Solutions Joseph Loughran; and President of Workforce Solutions Rodolfo Ploder, said two people, who asked not to be named because the probe is confidential.The company and the executives didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.Equifax disclosed earlier this month that it discovered a security breach on July 29. The three executives sold shares worth almost $1.8 million in early August. The company has said the managers didn't know of the breach at the time they sold the shares.To run afoul of laws that prohibit insider trading, a seller has to be aware of nonpublic information, said Stephen Crimmins, a former enforcement lawyer for the Securities and Exchange Commission.The probe will be handled by the U.S. attorney's office in Atlanta, where the credit firm's headquarters is located, said one of the people.  A spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office in Atlanta declined to comment.More than one third of U.S. senators have called on the Securities and Exchange Commission, in addition to the Justice Department, to get to the bottom of whether Equifax managers violated insider trading laws when they sold stock days after the company found out it was hacked.Separately, state and federal regulators and law enforcers are scrutinizing the company's data security practices and its response to the breach. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission and a Congressional committee with subpoena power last week joined the growing number of bodies scrutinizing the cyber attack that may have compromised the privacy of 143 million U.S. consumers.
"
9,EFX,"Heat continues to mount on credit reporting agency Equifax (EFX), which last week disclosed a massive breach in which hackers stole the personal identification information of as many as 143 million consumers.XOn Thursday, an open-source software organization said that it had publicly posted a patch for the vulnerability that hackers used to access Equifax data about two months before the hack, but that apparently Equifax did not install the patch before the breach took place, if it ever did.Separately on Thursday, the Federal Trade Commission said it is investigating the data breach. In addition, several congressional bills were filed that would hold Equifax and other data brokers accountable for such errors. And on Friday, U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren said she and other senators will introduce a bill to require credit bureaus to let consumers freeze their credit for free, according to Reuters news service. Some credit agencies charge around $5.A credit freeze blocks criminals from setting up bogus accounts whose purchases get charged to victims.The open-source software organization, the Apache Software Foundation (ASF), told IBD that it posted a patch for the vulnerability known as CVE-2017-5638 in the Apache Struts program on March 7.Equifax identified that as the vulnerability that hackers used. But the hack did not take place until mid-May through July, Equifax has said. Equifax realized it had been breached on July 29. Equifax disclosed the breach on Sept. 7.ASF suggested that an organization such as Equifax is presumed to be aware of such postings, but ASF does not know what if anything Equifax did know about the patch. It said that Equifax is not a customer of ASF and that ASF has no one-on-one relationship with Equifax.ASF spokeswoman Sally Khudairi told IBD by email: ""The Apache Software Foundation provides Open Source software that is freely available to all at no cost or restriction on its use. Those who wish to use our software projects simply download the projects from apache.org and/or one of many globally-distributed mirror sites.""Khudairi added: ""Any risks, along with patches, are announced and widely shared with Apache project communities. In addition, security vulnerabilities or exploits are disseminated on sites such as NIST (U.S. Department of Commerce National Institute of Standards and Technology) as well as dozens (if not hundreds) of software providers and security specialists (such as MITRE and Symantec).""Further, Khudairi said, ""As with all Apache software, patches are made available to the public at large. Financial services organizations are often known for being highly aware of security vulnerabilities in general, and are therefore particularly vigilant with their processes for patching any known exploits.""Equifax has not yet responded to IBD questions concerning the patch.ASF oversees more than 350 leading open source projects, including Apache HTTP Server — which it calls the world's most popular web-server software. ASF is a not-for-profit charitable organization, whose sponsors include high-profile corporations such as Capital One (COF), Comcast (CMCSA), Facebook (FB), Google (GOOGL), IBM (IBM), Microsoft (MSFT), Red Hat (RHT), Target (TGT) and Yahoo.Any entity can use ASF's software, even if they are not a sponsor. Equifax is not a sponsor.No one using the ""@equifax"" domain has communicated via email with ASF for almost two years, Khudairi says. ASF can't tell if an Equifax person communicated with ASF using a personal email address.On Sept. 8, the day after disclosing the breach, Equifax stock gapped down 14%. In the stock market today, its shares were trading near 91.40, down 37% from its 52-week high reached July 26.Shares in Symantec (SYMC), which owns credit monitoring service LifeLock, broke out above a 33.32 buy point in an irregular base Tuesday. It dipped below the buy point the next two days but rose back above it Friday. The stock ranks fourth in IBD's computer software security group, according to IBD's Stock Checkup. The industry group's ranking has risen to 60 from 177 three weeks ago. IBD tracks 197 industry groups.RELATED:Should You Join Lawsuits Mushrooming Against Equifax?Bogus Online Transactions Are Up In Wake Of Equifax BreachWhat You Should Do Now To Protect Yourself From The Equifax Data Breach

10,EFX,"In a season of disastrous hurricanes, beleaguered credit bureau Equifax (EFX) is in the volatile eye of a storm of angry consumers and investors. The credit reporting company has been hit by more than 30 lawsuits in the U.S., according to Reuters news service, including at least one suit accusing the company of securities fraud. And it appears to have backed off one maneuver that inflamed consumer ire.XThe suits stem from the massive theft of personal identification information from Equifax that the firm disclosed last week. The data breach took place from mid-May through July, Equifax said.Are you mad enough at Equifax to wonder how to start or join a lawsuit? Think you might feel that way if you discover that someone has bought, say, a new television and charged it to your name and address? And you begin to suspect the cyber crook got his information about you from Equifax?You can either start your own suit or join someone else who has already done so. If you do an online search for phrases like ""Equifax lawsuit how to join,"" you'll find news reports of people and lawyers who've already taken action. After a few more search steps, you'll have lawyers' contact information and you can reach out.You can also ask your own lawyer to recommend an appropriate counsel.One thing you can bet on is that multiple lawsuits will be filed independently of each other. ""The class action lawyer who represents the biggest damaged person or the biggest sheer number of victims will likely be appointed class counsel,"" said Chicago securities fraud lawyer Andrew Stoltmann. ""Eventually all will be consolidated into one (case).""Once someone is appointed class counsel, that lawyer in discovery gets to ask Equifax for the names and contact information of the people whose data was stolen from the credit reporting service. That pilferage involved information for as many as 143 million U.S. consumers, the firm says.The class-action counsel can then contact those people and invite them to join the suit.A class-action lawsuit will likely take three to six years, Stoltmann says.IBD'S TAKE: For advice about how to protect yourself from being victimized by identity thieves, read this IBD report about how to take real-world, practical steps to safeguard yourself and your personal identification information.In the first days after Equifax disclosed the data hack, people on social-media sites accused Equifax of not only endangering the financial health and peace of mind of millions of Americans, but also of forcing them to waive their right to sue the company if they wanted to find out from Equifax if their data had been among the information stolen. Critics said that the waiver came about when people logged in to use two Equifax websites. To proceed, users had to agree to the sites' terms of use, which include the waiver and the site user's consent to submit to arbitration instead.In apparent response to social-media criticism, Equifax reportedly had said it did not plan to hold victims of the data breach to their waiver and arbitration agreement. But securities fraud attorney Andrew Stoltmann told IBD that Equifax would still be free to hold victims to the waiver. ""It's my understanding that this is simply what they have said and the company isn't bound by it if they haven't taken the binding arbitration agreement out.""Apparently in part to quell criticism, Equifax says it has deleted the waiver and arbitration agreement. Spokeswoman Meredith Giffanti told IBD via email, ""To confirm (IBD's question), enrolling in the free credit file monitoring and identity theft protection products that we are offering as part of this cybersecurity incident does not prohibit consumers from taking legal action. We have already removed that language from the Terms of Use on the site www.equifaxsecurity2017.com.

Again, to be as clear as possible, we will not apply any arbitration clause or class action waiver against consumers for claims related to the free products offered in response to the cybersecurity incident or for claims related to the cybersecurity incident itself.""Equifax and the other two major national credit reporting services may seek a silver lining in this attack by selling products and services to consumers who want to protect their personal data. Credit freezes, for one, are subject to fees, which can vary depending on your home state. Nick Sloane of Sloane Wealth Management said, ""I anticipate (Equifax) will actually try to profit from this incident by selling upgraded stuff, like more frequent access to credit reports or extending the monitoring for a fee.""Sloane adds that he does not believe that inquiring about the status of one's data with Equifax would expose a consumer to additional security risk. But, he adds, he's not sure any consumer should believe Equifax if it says your data was not hacked. ""I don't think it is 'unsafe' to do so,"" he said. ""My comment is ... I would not believe them either way (why should you; they took how long to inform the public?).""Even if your data wasn't already hacked, you should consider security steps like a credit freeze, Sloane adds. ""If companies who have sensitive consumer information get their sites hacked (Target (TGT) comes to mind), then of course this will happen again. I really think it does not matter if you found out that you were or were not part of a data breach after it happened; it is likely going to occur to you and to me at some point.""Equifax disclosed the data breach last week. The company indicated that it realized it had been hacked on July 29.The data theft involved files that included people's names, Social Security numbers, birth dates, addresses and in some cases driver's license numbers. ""It poses an identity-theft threat to tens of millions of people,"" said Jocelyn Baird, associate editor of NextAdvisor, a consumer information website.Equifax shares sold off on Friday and Monday.

12,EFX,"Equifax (EFX), one of the three major U.S. credit bureaus, says online thieves stole sensitive data for as many as 143 million U.S. consumers. The theft involved files that included people's names, Social Security numbers, birth dates, addresses and in some cases driver's license numbers. ""It poses an identity-theft threat to tens of millions of people,"" said Jocelyn Baird, associate editor of NextAdvisor, a consumer information website.The hackers could misuse the information or sell it to criminals who then use it to make purchases that get billed to victims — people like you, perhaps you yourself — whose information was swiped from Equifax.So, what can you do to protect yourself? Baird recommends that you take these steps:In exchange, Equifax appeared initially to require people seeking that service to waive their right to participate in a class-action lawsuit against the Atlanta-based firm that was triggered by the cybertheft. That triggered a consumer backlash on social media sites.In reaction, late Friday Equifax reportedly said that the class-action waiver requirement in its terms of use for the Equifax site and TrustedID Premier, a related site, does not apply to this cybersecurity incident.More steps to protect yourself:Shares of Equifax (EFX), one of the three major U.S. credit bureaus, cratered on Friday, gapping down 14%. They plunged another 5% Monday to 166.61 to be 20% off their 52-week high.The sell-off followed both Equifax's Thursday disclosure of the data breach and its same-day disclosure that three senior executives sold shares worth almost $1.8 million in the days after the company realized on July 29 that it had been hacked. The company said the three executives had not been told of the breach when they sold shares on Aug. 1 and Aug. 2, Bloomberg reported.Some consumers expressed doubt that the executives sold shares without knowing about the breach. @rooroostar77 tweeted, ""4 days before announcing the #EquifaxBreach execs sold nearly $2 million worth of shares. How are they not in jail?""Yet Equifax insisted the executive sells were just a coincidence. Bloomberg reported on Thursday, ""The three 'sold a small percentage of their Equifax shares,' Ines Gutzmer, a spokeswoman for the Atlanta-based company, said in an emailed statement. They 'had no knowledge that an intrusion had occurred at the time.'""In addition, the hackers had accessed credit card numbers of about 209,000 consumers, Equifax revealed.

13,EFX,"Credit score service Equifax (EFX) late Thursday announced a major cybersecurity breach exposed up to 143 million U.S. consumers. The breach occurred from mid-May to July 2017, Equifax said.The company said it found no evidence of unauthorized use of its core consumer or commercial credit reporting databases. The data hackers accessed names, Social Security numbers, birth dates, addresses and, in some instances, driver's license numbers. Credit card numbers for about 209,000 U.S. consumers, and certain dispute documents with personal identifying information for approximately 182,000 U.S. consumers, were also exposed.""This is clearly a disappointing event for our company, and one that strikes at the heart of who we are and what we do. I apologize to consumers and our business customers for the concern and frustration this causes,"" Equifax CEO Richard Smith said in a statement.Equifax also identified unauthorized access to limited personal information for certain U.K. and Canadian residents.Equifax said it discovered the unauthorized access on July 29 and immediately acted to halt the intrusion.However, soon after the breach three top Equifax executives, including the CFO, sold a total of $1.8 million in shares, according to SEC filings that were not part of scheduled stock-sale programs, Bloomberg and others reported.The company said it will offer free credit monitoring for a year. It will mail notices to consumers with credit card numbers or dispute documents accessed.Equifax shares crashed 13% to 124.20 in late trading on the stock market today after tumbling much further.

15,EFX,"As manager Joseph Fath closes in on his fourth anniversary at the helm of T. Rowe Price Growth Stock Fund (PRGFX) in January, the $50.7 billion portfolio continues to outperform. Its 28.73% gain this year going into Thursday outpaced 88% of its large-cap growth peers tracked by Morningstar Direct. Over the past three years it has notched a 14.54% annual gain, topping 92% of its direct rivals.XThe fund has managed its torrid pace by targeting leading stocks like e-commerce powerhouse Alibaba Group (BABA), graphics chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) and online payment processor PayPal Holdings (PYPL). Those stocks are up 94%, 81% and 80% so far this year. Alibaba and PayPal have been in the portfolio since the third quarter of 2016 and fourth quarter of 2015, respectively.Nvidia has been in and out of the portfolio in recent quarters.Fath and his growth stock team look for companies that have one or more of these traits: superior growth in earnings and cash flow; sustainable earnings momentum even in economic slowdowns; and a lucrative niche in the economy and ability to grow — even amid slow GDP growth.Take Alibaba. ""Alibaba continues to benefit from improving user engagement amid its ongoing social commerce and mobile monetization efforts,"" Fath told shareholders in his semiannual report. ""The massive amount of data that its users generate also provide the company with a competitive advantage that could drive long-term earnings growth.""The Chinese Amazon's earnings-per-share growth has accelerated, having grown 30%, 37% and 60% the past three quarters. Annual EPS has grown for four years in a row. Consensus among analysts is that it will rise 44% this year.Alibaba is a longtime member of the Leaderboard — IBD's premium service that spotlights play-by-play moves of top stocks.Nvidia was been in and out of the portfolio in recent quarters as the fund initially took profits and then returned to the stock as we gained more conviction in the investment thesis, the growth stock team said.The stock's EPS growth is part of that process of persuasion. Its growth was at a triple-digit pace in four of the past five quarters. Still, operating costs have risen as the company invests in artificial intelligence and self-driving cars.The stock is ranked No. 1 in IBD's Electronics-Semiconductor Fabless industry group. That's due to achievements such as a 54% annual EPS growth rate over the past three years.IBD'S TAKE: You can see how Nvidia other fundamental and technical traits stack up against its rivals' in IBD's easy-to-understand Stock Checkup.PayPal EPS has also sped up, growing 9%, 13%, 17%, 19%, 28% and 31% in the past six quarters.The stock ranks No. 1 in IBD's Finance-Credit Card/Payment Processor industry group thanks to traits such as four straight years of annual EPS growth.The 31% September-quarter profit topped analysts' views. So did the 21% revenue increase. PayPal issued a current-quarter sales forecast that topped analyst estimates.PayPal is among the IBD 50 roster of fast-growing companies.""We have a high conviction in PayPal as digital online payments are growing significantly on a global scale,"" Fath told shareholders. ""The company's strong balance sheet and the potential to monetize its Venmo peer-to-peer payment platform could lead to further outperformance.""Can Fath keep his streak going? That hinges partly on the performance of new stock buys, such as credit reporting bureau TransUnion (TRU), credit-card payment processor Vantiv (VNTV) and security software firm Symantec (SYMC).TransUnion shares got clobbered in the second week of September amid consumer anger and congressional inquiries sparked by the Equifax (EFX) data breach. But shares have rallied since then, resuming an uptrend that began late in 2016.While credit bureaus suffered withering criticism after the Equifax cyberattack, most of TransUnion's business comes from corporations. Only 23% of its revenue is from what the company calls its consumer interactive segment.And TransUnion has reinforced the corporate-focused part of its business with steps like its acquisition of Datalink Services, a leading provider of vehicle and driving records. The acquisition should enable TransUnion's DriverRisk to offer insurers a full-driving record platform.TransUnion, due to report third-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Oct. 27, was expected by analysts to post a 21% increase in earnings.Vantiv provides credit, debit and prepaid payment processing. It ranks No. 10 in PayPal's IBD industry group.Last summer the company beat rivals like PayPal to the punch by acquiring British-based Worldpay Group. The deal greatly expanded Vantiv's online capabilities.Third-quarter EPS, reported Thursday, rose 27% to 90 cents, up from Q2's 19% gain. Charles Drucker, president and CEO of Vantiv, said in a release, ""We are investing in high growth segments of the market, including our combination with Worldpay, which will position us as a global acquirer with a leading position in e-commerce.""Symantec develops internet and network security, storage and systems management applications for consumers and enterprises.Shares initially jumped on news of the Equifax breach. They've pulled back a little since early October, but have found support at their 50-day moving average.EPS grew an average of 21% in each of the past three quarters. Analysts estimate a 43% increase for the current stanza and 53% for the current fiscal year.RELATED:You Need This Much Retirement Savings At Your Age And IncomeTop Mutual Fund Manager Has Several Stocks In Buy Zone

The situation was brought to Sonic's attention last week by its credit-card processor, which flagged ""unusual activity"" with cards used at its restaurants.""We are working to understand the nature and scope of this issue, as we know how important this is to our guests,"" the company said in a prepared statement. ""We immediately engaged third-party forensic experts and law enforcement when we heard from our processor. While law enforcement limits the information we can share, we will communicate additional information as we are able.""Brian Krebs, an independent journalist who investigates breaches, reported late Tuesday that the breach led to a ""fire sale"" on millions of stolen credit- and debit-card accounts. The information was put up for sale in a so-called theft bazaar called Joker's Stash, Krebs said.The shares fell as much as 4.4% to $23.52 on Wednesday, the biggest intraday drop since Aug. 8. The stock was down 7.2% this year through Tuesday's close, hurt by broader headwinds in the restaurant industry.The dangers of data breaches were thrown back in the spotlight this month after Equifax (EFX) exposed the data of 143 million Americans. The credit-reporting company said hackers accessed a vast trove of names, Social Security numbers, birth dates, addresses and driver's license numbers. Chief Executive Richard Smith stepped down in the wake of the revelations.Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) also disclosed a breach earlier this year, saying hackers had installed malicious software in order to grab customer data from point-of-sale devices.Sonic, based in Oklahoma City, serves about 3 million customers a day.

18,EFX,"Pretty much everyone hates Equifax (EFX) right now. But despite the outrage over its handling of a data breach that left vulnerable the core identifying information for up to 143 million American customers, it won't exactly strangle profits for the credit reporting agency in the near term, a JPMorgan analyst says.XWhile emphasizing that it was still too early to gauge the full financial impact from the hack, JPMorgan analyst Andrew Steinerman cut his 2018 earnings-per-share outlook for Equifax by 10% —  to $6.16 from $6.83. For this year, Steinerman cut his 2017 EPS forecast to $5.87 from $6.08 — a 3% hit.He also cut his price target on the stock to 135 from 167. He has an overweight rating on the stock.""Equifax is a well-capitalized company with strong free cash flow and an admirable innovative culture which should persist long after the effects of this data breach,"" he wrote in a research note on Thursday. ""That said, the congressional hearings bear risk.""Equifax CEO Richard Smith, who has apologized for the incident and vowed change, is set to testify before a House panel on Oct. 3. The Senate Finance Committee has also sought more information from the company related to the hack. The FTC also is investigating, the agency confirmed Thursday. Nearly 40 states have also joined an investigation of the matter, according to Reuters.Steinerman said new cybersecurity protocols, fines and an extended offering of the Equifax's TrustedID credit-monitoring service — which Equifax is currently giving out free for 12 months — could add to costs following those inquiries.The TrustedID offering seems likely to be the biggest cost for the company, Steinerman said. But exact numbers will depend on how many people actually use the service.""Notably,"" he said, ""the company is not automatically switching over paid customers to the free product, and we expect a 75% take rate for the free product amongst this paying population given a proven appreciation for credit monitoring offset by a natural level of nonswitching due to lack of awareness, laziness and other circumstances.""Lawsuits and security costs could pile up, and there are questions about how much insurance will cover amid questions about Equifax's due diligence in keeping security tight, he said.Equifax fell 2.4% to 96.65 in the stock market today after tumbling intraday to 89.59, the worst since February 2015.

Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., on Wednesday requested information from the CEOs of TransUnion and Experian to learn more about how the companies are handling their own security in the wake of Equifax's troubles.Equifax has drawn criticism for disclosing the breach weeks after the company learned of it, and faced accusations that it hadn't done enough to protect itself following other cyber-intrusions.What's more, the company drew outrage after many people said the support services it set up in the wake of the data theft were insufficient and did not make it clear if their personal data was affected. Equifax, following widespread anger, has temporarily waived fees to freeze credit files, a precaution many have advised consumers to take following the breach.Three executives also sold Equifax shares a few days after the company discovered the breach, although the company has said the trio hadn't yet learned of the hack at the time.

But — looking ahead — some investors have begun to take defensive steps at the margins of their portfolios, wondering how long the run-up can dodge such perils as increasingly high valuations, geopolitics tensions and political infighting in D.C.XIn July, the broad stock market notched its best monthly gain since February's 3.97% jump. Back then, the market was driven by investor optimism that the Trump era would usher in new policies lowering the regulatory burden on several industries, corporate tax reform and infrastructure spending.Despite July's negative headlines about the failure of health care reform and White House staff intrigue, the market rose last month because of encouraging corporate earnings. ""What's driving the appreciation is U.S. corporate earnings, which are surprising to the upside,"" said Lawrence Kemp, co-manager of $794 million BlackRock Mid-Cap Growth Equity Fund (BMGKX), which was among the top performing midcap stock mutual funds year to date through month end. ""They were up close to 15% in the first quarter and about 11% in Q2.""Low interest rates and global economic acceleration have been key factors, Kemp said.Large-cap growth funds — like $3 billion BlackRock Capital Appreciation (MAFGX), of which Kemp is sole manager — were up 3.00% last month. That led the July charge by U.S. diversified stock mutual funds. Counted among BlackRock Capital's recent top holdings, Microsoft, rose 5.5% and Visa 6.2% in July.Global science/technology funds gained 4.56% to lead all major sectors.World equity stock mutual funds gained 3.47% to top U.S. diversified stock funds. Latin American funds soared 7.42% to pace foreign stock funds.Taxable and tax-exempt bond mutual funds on average edged ahead.Aram Green, manager of tiny $28 million ClearBridge Select (LBFIX), another top-performing midcap growth fund year to date, said economic data and consumer confidence are ""rosy enough to continue to propel investors' expectations for the rest of the year.""Still, he cautioned that the lack of investor fear ""is surprising given the social and political unrest: actions by North Korea, skirmishes in the Middle East, rough dialogue between the U.S. and Russia, as well as the continued turnover in the Trump (White House) and lack of further movement on the health care bill or anything else promised to Trump constituents.""""I'd be surprised if we make it without a sell-off between now and year-end,"" Green added. ""That's not a forecast, but I would be surprised.""In anticipation, he has made defensive shifts in his portfolio. He has taken some profits and raised cash to an above-average 15% or so. He also has raised cash by selling calls on some positions with little if any near-term upside. In addition, he is shorting some stocks whose prospects he thinks are weak.One holding whose outlook he does like is software developer New Relic (NEWR). ""Their core business is monitoring applications and understanding where (problems) may develop,"" he said. The firm is also expanding into monitoring clients' information technology infrastructure. ""As more business is conducted on the internet, especially on the Cloud, New Relic will be a success,"" he said. Sales have mushroomed the past three fiscal years to $263 million from $63 million, but the company has yet to post an annual profit.Reflecting July's leadership by large-cap growth stocks in general and tech names, Tom Galvin, lead manager of $4.3 billion Columbia Select Large Cap Growth (CCWRX), says Amazon (AMZN) illustrates his outlook. He seeks stocks that are leading players in industries that are gaining wallet share. ""That's what Amazon is,"" he added.Amazon reported results on July 27. Earnings per share were only 40 cents, a 78% decline and missing Wall Street consensus expectations of $1.42 per share. The stock pulled back and is testing support at its 50-day moving average.IBD'S TAKE: To keep up with news about the large-cap internet consumer names, follow IBD's FANG — Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Google — stock news page.Galvin says Priceline (PCLN) also illustrates his view. ""They're a beneficiary of increased broadband online usage and mobile penetration in particular, which is driving demand for e-commerce solutions while demographics are driving demand for airlines, hotels and automobile rentals."" He said he expects growth in the mid teens are better ""for the next few years as they expand geographically and their already diverse product set.""The stock rose 8% in July, breaking out of a flat base in the process.Visa (V) is a third example of his expectations. ""Visa has an opportunity for a long and durable growth runway due to conversion from cash and checks to paying by credit cards and virtual payments by consumers and businesses globally,"" he said.Still, Galvin 's appetite for tech stocks is limited. ""In the past six months we have been trimming, given the strong year-to-date gains,"" he said. Before six months ago, his fund was overweight in tech vs. the Russell 1000 Growth index. Now the fund's tech weight is 33% weight vs. 37% for its bogey. ""We have reallocated some money into the consumer sector,"" he said.""In the consumer space, demographics have been a significant force in spending trends, which have created tail winds in leisure stocks, health care, education and entertainment,"" he added.In Kemp's large-cap BlackRock fund, he cites Alphabet (GOOGL) as an example of his outlook. ""It has the dominant global search engine,"" he said. ""It's used by everyone. They continue to improve their technology, which underlays its use across different types of cellular networks, fueling unit growth."" Kemp added that the 50-minute average daily time spent on-site by users is ""a hidden asset"" that the company keeps finding new ways to monetize through advertising.In his midcap fund, Kemp likes San Francisco-based First Republic Bank (FRC). ""They're very well run,"" he said. ""They're uniquely positioned to grow basically 20% a year as they open new offices around the country and penetrate existing (markets) more.""He also cites Equifax (EFX), whose consumer credit and additional data is used by mortgage lenders and other clients. Its data finds an increasing number of uses as advertisers seek to aim more highly targeted pitches at consumers, he said.The $9.8 billion Vanguard Primecap Core (VPCCX), a large-cap growth fund and an IBD 2017 Best Mutual Fund Awards winner, edged up 0.44% last month. China e-commerce giant Alibaba Group (BABA) was a key driver. The stock sports a 99 Comp Rating, and is a member of IBD's Leaderboard — IBD's premium service that spotlights play-by-play of top stocks — as well as the IBD 50 list.At an investor conference, Alibaba said it expects revenue to grow 45% to 49% this fiscal year, well above analysts' consensus estimate of 37%.RELATED:You Need This Much Retirement Savings At Your Age And Income7 Steps For Millennials Who Want To Become Rich Retirees

45,EFX,"In a strong market, Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) would be looking very attractive. The search giant's stock is close to a potential buy point, consolidating near record highs.In the current shaky market, investors should be cautious about making any purchases. But you should always be looking for quality stocks forming sound consolidations.Among those bullish patterns is the flat base, where leading stocks can catch their breath for several weeks before trying to make a new advance. Flat bases are common now given the market's subdued, sideways action until the last week or so.Alphabet leads four top-rated stocks that are in flat bases. All four -- the others are Nvidia (NVDA), Texas Instruments (TXN) and Equifax (EFX) -- have found support at or near the 50-day moving average recently.IBD'S TAKE: The flat base is a sideways pattern, with a smaller decline than in other patterns. It can be of short duration (minimum five weeks) and often forms after a breakout from a cup-with-handle or double-bottom base. Here's a quick explainer on how to identify a proper flat base.Alphabet is a fairly typical example of a flat base. The stock broke out of a double-bottom base with a 753.58 entry in late July. Shares peaked at 813.88 on Aug. 11, then began consolidating in a sideways. Shares never fell more than 4% from the high, finding support last week just above the 50-day moving average, closing Friday at 797.97. The flat base entry point is 813.98.Alphabet shares rose early but closed down 0.3% at 795.39 on the stock market today.Fundamentals: Q2 adjusted earnings rose 20% vs. a year earlier, picking up from 14% in Q1. Total revenue growth has trended higher, with Q2's 21% increase the best in two years. Core revenue, which excludes traffic acquisition costs -- what it pays partner websites to carry ads -- climbed 22%.RELATED:Google Rebounds With Big Q2 EPS, Revenue BeatNvidia makes chips for gaming, autonomous driving and artificial intelligence.The stock had a long run up before peaking at 63.50. Shares moved sideways, finding support at the 50-day line on Sept. 12 as rebounded last week. At five weeks, Nvidia now has a flat-base pattern with an 63.60 buy point. Nvidia closed Friday at 62.86.Nvidia rose 1.3% to 63.67 after climbing as high as 65.26. The stock closed just above the pivot point, but volume ended about average. It's a tough time to be making any new buys, in any caseFundamentals: Earnings skyrocketed 700% in the latest quarter.

49,EFX,"Both domestic and international stock ETFs spiked Thursday, as the hotly debated Brexit referendum got under way. The vote, whose outcome is expected shortly, is still considered too close to call.Financial stocks outpaced S&P 500 sectors ahead of the release of the first batch of results from the Federal Reserve's annual stress tests. Those exams assess banks' ability to withstand shocks to the market and their finances.SPDR S&P Regional Banking (KRE) and SPDR S&P Bank (KBE) each jabbed about 3% higher.

50,EFX,"After a mild pullback in April, and again in mid-May, low volatility ETFs are on the upswing again. These strategies cushion portfolios against big market drawdowns like the ones investors saw early this year.PowerShares S&P MidCap Low Volatility (XMLV) posted a fresh 52-week high of 38.09 on the stock market today. Its bolting RS line is a sign that it is outperforming the benchmark S&P 500.The exchange traded fund invests in roughly 80 of the least volatile midcap stocks, including salvaged-car auctioneer Copart (CPRT), ranked No. 1 by IBD in the auto parts industry group.Stocks with the lowest price volatility get the biggest weighting in the XMLV portfolio.However, two industry experts strike notes of caution about this popular asset class.Low volatility ETFs tend to be stuffed with more established, dividend-paying names. A potential Fed interest-rate hike in June or July could dent high-dividend sectors such as utilities or consumer staples, Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF research for S&P Global Market Intelligence, wrote June 1. His research note preceded Friday's dismal jobs report, which was perceived to set back the likelihood of an imminent rate hike.Rosenbluth suggests that investors may want to consider a small, new rival to the hugely popular iShares Edge MSCI Minimum Volatility (USMV) and PowerShares S&P 500 Low Volatility (SPLV).Like SPLV, PowerShares S&P 500 ex-Rate Sensitive Low Volatility (XRLV) invests in low volatility stocks in the S&P 500. But there's a difference.SPLV looks for the 100 stocks with the lowest volatility over the past 12 months. XRLV invests in the 100 stocks that show both low volatility and low interest-rate risk. It removes stocks that have historically lagged when rates are rising.XRLV has a zero weighting in utilities and 14.6% in consumer staples, both of which are rate-sensitive sectors. By comparison, SPLV has 21.1% and 20.8% weightings in the respective sectors. Also, XRLV has a 17.5% weighting in the financial sector vs. 13.0% for SPLV. Banks and some other financial services tend to benefit from increasing rates.Coca-Cola (KO), Waste Management (WM) and PepsiCo (PEP) and a host of other stocks are common to both portfolios.But medical equipment maker Thermo Fisher Scientific (TMO) and credit-ratings agency Equifax (EFX) are among XRLV holdings not to be found in SPLV.As a new ETF, XRLV should be traded with care.Moreover, low volatility stocks may be starting to look expensive. ""As more money has piled in (to low or minimum volatility ETFs), valuations have richened commensurately,"" Ben Johnson, director of global ETF research for Morningstar Inc., wrote in a May report.Johnson looked at the historical relationship between the beginning value of the MSCI USA Minimum Volatility Index's price-to-cash-earnings ratio and subsequent 3-year annualized returns. He found that the richer the starting valuation, the lower the ensuing return.""At current levels, newcomers to the low volatility part could be setting themselves up for disappointing future returns,"" Johnson cautioned.This year, low volatility ETFs focused on U.S. large caps have surged in popularity.IShares Edge MSCI Minimum Volatility (USMV) absorbed a staggering $5.37 billion in new money through May, more than any other equity exchange traded fund. PowerShares S&P 500 Low Volatility (SPLV) soaked in $1.04 billion over the same period.Smart fund investors are looking beyond large caps for less risky stocks. Both XMLV and PowerShares S&P SmallCap Low Volatility (XSLV) have positive net flow year to date.They're outperforming their large-cap peers too. XMLV was up 11.6% year to date through June 2 vs. 8.9% for XSLV, 6.8% for XRLV and 6.6% for SPLV.By comparison, SPDR S&P 500 (SPY), a proxy for the broad market, gained 4.0%.
"
51,EFX,"TransUnion (TRU) may not be the hottest name in the market or have the same brand recognition as, say, Apple (AAPL), but its stock has been on fire of late.A growing consumer credit market is benefiting the provider of consumer reports, risk scores and analytics, and TransUnion's diversification is helping it stand out from the pack. The company has transformed beyond its consumer credit roots and into a diversified risk management analytics firm. That's translated to soaring organic revenue growth and significant share price gains.Helping the Chicago-based company is what JPMorgan says is its extension into data sets that had been underutilized by consumer credit reporting vendors. That includes public records data such as court judgments, bankruptcies, liens, marriages and divorces. There's also driver history data as well as alternative data, including information on consumers with thin credit files.""While modest in scope currently, these unique offerings are growing quickly and morph TransUnion from a traditional (consumer reporting agency) into a diversified risk management solutions firm with an expanded addressable market,"" JPMorgan analyst Andrew Steinerman said in an April 27 note to clients.He added that this evolution helps distinguish the June 2015 initial public offering from its primary competitors, namely Experian and Equifax (EFX), which is a member of Investor's Business Daily's IBD 50 list of top-rated stocks. The analyst notes that TransUnion is increasing its comparability to companies such as privately held LexisNexis Risk Solutions and Verisk Analytics (VRSK) as well.A Zacks Equity Research report on May 10 noted the company’s financial appeal, saying it has highly recurring and diversified revenue streams, significant operating leverage, low capital requirements and cash flows that are ""strong and stable.""""Impressively, it deals with the 10 largest U.S. banks, the top 5 credit card issuers, the biggest 25 auto lenders, thousands of healthcare providers and federal, state and local government agencies,"" the Zacks report added.That recipe of a strong business model and notable client exposure had a positive impact on the company’s latest quarterly results. After the market close on April 26, TransUnion reported a 60% rise in first-quarter adjusted earnings to 32 cents a share, beating analyst estimates for 26 cents. Revenue climbed 15% to $406 million for the quarter, handily topping projections for $380 million.""In our view, a beat in (2016's first quarter) was perhaps foreseeable, but the extent to which (TransUnion's) results outperformed despite lapping tougher (year-over-year) comps was exemplary,"" JPMorgan's Steinerman said.TransUnion’s U.S. information services segment saw revenue grow 13% to $247 million, accounting for 57% of the top line total. Revenue from the company’s international business increased 7% to 68 million, with 5% of the growth due to acquisitions. The company said the international segment’s revenue growth would have been 22% on a constant currency basis.Consumer interactive revenue jumped 25% to $105 million, driven by strength in both direct and indirect solutions.""The new growth initiative investments, and productivity investments at Spark (a company analytics and technology investment project) are together helping to fuel not only impressive top line growth, but also notable margin expansion,"" said TransUnion Chief Executive Jim Peck during the company's quarterly conference call on April 26.TransUnion raised its full-year guidance, but it was on the conservative side. The company sees 2016 EPS in the range of $1.30 to $1.34, up from $1.24 to $1.28 previously. The midpoint of $1.32 was a hair below projections for $1.33.TransUnion upped its revenue expectation to $1.63 billion to $1.65 billion, from $1.6 billion to $1.62 billion, while analysts have modeled $1.66 billion.""While representing a slowdown from 2015’s remarkable growth rates, 2016 guidance is likely lower due to mortgage assumptions, tough year-over-year comps, and beginning-of-year conservatism,"" Steinerman said. ""We find these goals achievable and we note guidance’s implication that (TransUnion's) breadth and pace of growth will remain best-in-class.""Wall Street seems to have agreed. Shares vaulted 8.5% the day after the report to become extended from the 5% buy range from a cup-with-handle base it initially broke out of on March 29. Shares are now extended roughly 14% from the 27.15 buy point, after hitting a new all-time high and nearing the 20% profit-taking zone on May 10.TransUnion has risen roughly 38% from its June 2015 IPO price of 22.50. The stock earns an IBD Composite Rating of 98 out of 99, meaning it outperforms 98% of all stocks in the market as measured by fundamental and technical factors. Those factors include earnings and sales growth, profit margins, return on equity and relative share price performance.Looking ahead, TransUnion has more growth opportunities -- though it has strong prior-year metrics to compete against.""While we acknowledge tougher comps in the back half of the year, we are comfortable with (TransUnion's) forecasted margin expansion and continued strength in emerging verticals such as healthcare and insurance, in addition to the (2016's second half) launch of trended data with Fannie Mae that should boost performance,"" Cowen and Company analyst George Mihalos said in an April 27 research report.Steinerman says the company's management team is a ""critical component"" to the company's success.""Under current broad leadership, the company has diversified into tangential data sets/data analytics and has overhauled its technology infrastructure,"" he said.

"
71,EFX,"Since its initial public offering on June 25, credit reporting agency TransUnion has moved full speed ahead to assure that it stays on the right growth trajectory.
"
72,EFX,"That trajectory encompasses several growth areas for TransUnion (TRU), which provides risk and information services to businesses and consumers.
"
73,EFX,"Businesses use its information services for a number of functions, including acquiring new customers, assessing a consumer's ability to pay for services, measuring and managing debt portfolio risk, collecting debt and verifying consumer identities.
"
74,EFX,"Consumers use its services to view their credit profiles and access analytical tools that help them understand and manage their personal information and take precautions against identity theft.
"
75,EFX,"Different Take On Data
"
76,EFX,"TransUnion has identified three areas of growth, says Curt Miller, the company's senior vice president of global strategy and M&A.
"
77,EFX,"The primary drivers are new product development and growth in emerging businesses and geographic markets, he says. The company also continues efforts to boost its core business in such markets as financial services.
"
78,EFX,"One such product is CreditVision, which TransUnion launched in 2013 and which has been gaining momentum ever since.
"
79,EFX,"""CreditVision is an example of a different way of looking at the same credit bureau data,"" Miller told IBD.
"
80,EFX,"Here's why: A traditional credit report is a snapshot in time of a consumer's credit, he says. In contrast, CreditVision looks at the trends that happened to the consumer over time, before the snapshot, to indicate risk level.
"
81,EFX,"TransUnion is expanding CreditVision in the U.S., thanks partly to a deal with mortgage giant Fannie Mae (FNMA) to provide its trended consumer credit data in the assessment of mortgage applicants.
"
82,EFX,"During the middle of next year, Fannie Mae will require lenders to used ""trended"" credit data when underwriting single-family borrowers through its automated underwriting system.
"
83,EFX,"That's where TransUnion comes in. Fannie Mae will integrate trended views from TransUnion's CreditVision product offering into mortgage application assessments, starting in the middle of next year.
"
84,EFX,"Reporting bureau Equifax (EFX) will also provide trended data to Fannie Mae starting in mid-2016, Fannie Mae said in a press release.
"
85,EFX,"Stifel analyst Shlomo Rosenbaum says that TransUnion is the only company offering the kind of real-time trended data that CreditVision provides.
"
86,EFX,"""We understand that (Equifax) is investing to improve its trended data product to be ready for that mid-2016 deadline, and that (rival Experian) does not have a product in that area yet to speak of,"" Rosenbaum noted in a report.
"
87,EFX,"TransUnion is the last of the Big Three global credit reporting bureaus to go public. Equifax has been trading on the NYSE for a long time, and Experian trades on the London Stock Exchange.
"
88,EFX,"'Good Flywheel'
"
89,EFX,"TransUnion priced its IPO at 22.50, opened at 24.62 and closed the day at 25.40. The stock has since traded in a tight range and currently trades near 26.
"
90,EFX,"""People need to get more familiarity,"" Rosenbaum said. ""When they see it puts up good numbers and good growth, you will see more investors getting behind the story. It seems like they've built a good flywheel for strong growth.""
"
91,EFX,"TransUnion's third-quarter numbers were pretty decent. Revenue rose 15% from a year earlier to $389.1 million, well above analyst consensus estimates. Earnings came in at 30 cents a share, 2 cents above analyst consensus estimates, according to Thomson Reuters.
"
92,EFX,"""We experienced robust demand from business customers and consumers for core and new products across our markets,"" CEO Jim Peck said on a Q3 conference call.
"
93,EFX,"Among TransUnion's strengths during the quarter was its CreditVision business, which saw revenue more than double during the quarter.
"
94,EFX,"Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect TransUnion's full-year earnings to rise 24% in 2016 and another 12% in 2017.
"
95,EFX,"New products should help fuel that growth.
"
96,EFX,"""We continue to innovate around CreditVision,"" Miller said.
"
97,EFX,"For example, TransUnion in October released CreditVision Link, which combines alternative data with trended credit bureau data to help score even more of the population that can't normally be scored.
"
98,EFX,"CreditVision Link's alternative data assets include property, tax and deed records, checking/debit accounts and payday lending information. These alternative data sources have proven to accurately score more than 90% of applicants whom traditional models would otherwise return as no-hit or thin-file.
"
99,EFX,"Going International
"
100,EFX,"TransUnion also has taken CreditVision internationally to Canada and Hong Kong, and it has plans to continue expansion into more foreign markets.
"
101,EFX,"An example of an emerging business segment is in health care, where TransUnion provides hospitals with several solutions. Its products have helped more than 1,000 hospitals and thousands of physician partners identify over $5 billion in uncompensated care revenue, Miller says.
"
102,EFX,"As part of its initiatives in its core business, TransUnion is taking steps to get closer to its customers, he says. These steps include bringing on sales professionals and consultants who have experience and backgrounds working for TransUnion's customers.
"
103,EFX,"""This gives them the ability to see what customers' problems are and partner with customers to solve their problems,"" said Miller.
"
104,EFX,"TransUnion is a part of IBD's Financial Services-Specialty industry group. It has an 86 IBD Composite Rating out of a possible 99.

144,EFX,"Today's Weekly Review is laden with financials, and it's not just the spate of regional banks that have been making the screen. Companies in insurance and financial services appear up and down the list of high price and earnings performance stocks. A handful are forming bases, too.AmTrust Financial (AFSI) is shaping the right side of a cup-shaped base with a 71.97 buy point.The insurer has been growing through acquisitions. In September, it announced that it is buying Texas-based Republic Cos. and its affiliates, which provide property and casualty coverage, for about $233 million.Amerisafe (AMSF), a thinly traded workers comp provider, is in buy range from the 51.41 buy point of its latest base. The stock has been a slow mover traditionally, yet has a solid Relative Price Strength Rating above 90.Fair Isaac (FICO) is trying for a new base after a breakout in July failed. The new buy point is 97.66. If the company's ticker symbol sounds familiar it's because Fair Isaac created the FICO scores for individuals' creditworthiness.Equifax (EFX), one of the big three credit reporting agencies, is trying to break out past a 105.96 buy point. News last week that Australian rival Veda accepted a sweetened buyout offer from Equifax helped the stock climb the right side of its pattern.Among the well-performing credit card and payment processing industry group, Heartland Payment Systems (HPY) is in buy range after breaking out past 64.78.The group stood out after Global Payments (GPN) beat earnings and revenue expectations Oct. 7 and soared to a new high. The company also raised its profit outlook.Many regional banks and savings and loans continue to appear on Your Weekly Review. Southeast banks make up the largest bloc among the various groups representing regional banks.

145,EFX,"Credit reporting agency TransUnion — whose services include providing credit scores for consumers — fetched a pretty good score of its own from investors when it went public on June 25.TransUnion (TRU) priced its IPO at 22.50, opened at 24.62 and closed the day at 25.40. The stock has since traded in a tight range and currently trades near 26.TransUnion provides risk and information services to businesses and consumers. It offers consumer reports, risk scores and analytics to businesses, primarily in credit risk management.Businesses use its information services for a number of functions, including acquiring new customers, assessing a consumer's ability to pay for services, measuring and managing debt portfolio risk, collecting debt and verifying consumer identities.Consumers use its services to view their credit profiles and access analytical tools that help them understand and manage their personal information and take precautions against identity theft. TransUnion has operations in more than 30 countries.Favorable TrendsTransUnion's business has been heating up in the U.S. amid a strengthening housing market, rising auto sales and a brightening jobs picture. All of these trends have led to increased demand for financing and the credit checks that go along with it.Stifel analyst Shlomo Rosenbaum, who initiated coverage on TransUnion with a buy rating, says the stock provides a ""good opportunity"" for investors, in part because the company ""should have good numbers"" moving forward.""The consumer credit environment is getting better domestically,"" Rosenbaum told IBD. ""They're positioned well in some good growth markets internationally, and they've gotten into some other domestic areas that have growth, like public records data and parts of the health care market.""TransUnion noted in filings with the Securities & Exchange Commission that for the past three years, it has seen improvement in the U.S. consumer lending market, ""including mortgage refinancings resulting from low long-term mortgage rates, an improving housing market, increased auto loans, a decrease in unemployment, an increase in consumer confidence and an increase in demand for (its) marketing services.""These factors have helped drive improved financial results in all of its segments for the first three months of 2015 and all of 2014 and 2013.""The consumer credit environment is getting better in the U.S.,"" Rosenbaum said. ""We're seeing a little loosening of credit, banks (are) more willing to lend, and consumers are less nervous to borrow incrementally.""TransUnion is one of the three largest global credit reporting bureaus, and the last of the three to go public. The other two are Equifax (EFX) and Dublin-based Experian, which trades on the London Stock Exchange.TransUnion had filed for an IPO in 2011 but withdrew the offering a year later after it was sold by private equity firm Madison Dearborn Partners and the Pritzker family to Advent International and a unit of Goldman Sachs Group (GS). Post-IPO, Advent and Goldman continue to own a majority stake in TransUnion.Although consumer credit data is a core service at TransUnion, it has expanded beyond that core.In a report, JPMorgan analyst Andrew Steinerman said that the company has ""extended into data sets underutilized"" by the consumer credit reporting agencies. They include public records data such as court judgments, bankruptcies and driver history data, including traffic tickets and other court records.""While modest in scope, these unique offerings are growing quickly and morph TransUnion from a traditional (credit reporting agency) into a diversified risk management solutions firm with an expanded addressable market,"" Steinerman noted.TransUnion also has been upping its game internationally, especially in India, Africa and Hong Kong.For example, last year the company increased its equity interest in Credit Information Bureau (India) Ltd., or CIBIL, from 27.5% to a majority stake of 55%. CIBIL is the biggest credit bureau in India, Rosenbaum says.Bullish OutlookIn the U.S., TransUnion is a bit smaller than Equifax and Experian in terms of market share, but it's still a major player.The company should see strong earnings gains in coming years. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect TransUnion to post full-year adjusted EPS of 96 cents a share. They see EPS rising 23% to $1.18 a share in 2016 and another 12% to $1.32 in 2017.Rosenbaum figures that TransUnion can outperform those expectations.""I think it's going to do well and trade in tandem with Equifax, the closest public company to TransUnion,"" he said. ""In the near term, I see both of these companies being a 'beat and raise' story. That means when they report earnings, they will be above what people expected, and the guidance will go up after that.""TransUnion is well diversified in its customer base. It offers services to customers in financial services, insurance, health care, real estate and other industries.In financial services, it serves almost all of the major banks in all facets of the customer lifecycle, from acquisition through account management and collections. Its CreditVision product, for example, is designed to offer insight into the speed and magnitude of changes in consumer risk over time.Another offering, its AdSurety digital marketing product, lets banks deliver personalized messages on the Internet.In health care, thousands of providers and more than 1,000 hospitals use TransUnion's revenue cycle management product to verify a patient's identity; check a patient's insurance eligibility and ability to pay; estimate patient payment amounts; and, if needed, qualify patients for federal, state and local entitlement programs.Acquisitions have helped TransUnion broaden its lineup. For example, last year it acquired an 87.5% ownership interest in Drivers History Information Sales, which collects traffic violation and criminal court data.TransUnion is a part of IBD's Financial Services-Specialty industry group, where it has an 81 Composite Rating out of a possible 99. Equifax leads the group with a 93 rating. The group also includes CBOE Holdings (CBOE), which has a Composite Rating of 89.

152,EFX,"On Thursday, members of the Federal Communications Commission voted to overturn Obama-era net neutrality rules in a controversial decision that threatens to change the way Americans purchase and receive internet service and online content.At the core of the net neutrality debate is a disagreement over what the nature of the internet should be. To some, it seems that internet service providers are delivering a product, just like any other business, and should be free of unnecessary government regulations. To others, it feels appropriate for the government to protect the internet’s status as an equal playing field that is immune from conflicts of interest.Net neutrality is one of several important ongoing debates about how the internet should function, and with the number of connected devices worldwide set to grow exponentially over the next few years, these debates should become more and more consequential.Along with net neutrality, one of the more public conversations about the internet that is happening throughout our society relates to how web-based companies handle the private information of their users.The average person living in a nation with a developed economy and widespread internet infrastructure is online more frequently than ever before. But that also means that all the personal information associated with their online activity—including their name, address, credit card information, shopping habits, and personal relationships—is more vulnerable than ever before.Public awareness of digital privacy has been increasing for years, but scrutiny over the failure of companies to properly protect user data was punctuated by the devastating Equifax (EFX  -  Free Report) hack in 2017.What’s more, several notable social media companies have been forced to answer questions related to the use of its website to spread disinformation during the 2016 presidential campaign cycle. As it turns out, a large part of Russia’s concentrated efforts to interfere in the U.S. election took place on public internet forums, and new findings suggest that users on Twitter (TWTR  -  Free Report), Facebook (FB  -  Free Report), and Google (GOOGL  -  Free Report), among others, were subjected to the country’s propaganda campaign.Now, as we approache the New Year, it looks like user privacy will emerge as the most important tech topic of 2018. Before the “cooler” new trends—including the expansion of the Internet of Things, the deployment of self-driving cars, and the development of artificial intelligence—can really take off, internet companies will need to ensure that user data is secure.From an investing perspective, user privacy is even more important because we already know that our favorite internet firms are planning to spend tons of cash on security in the upcoming year (also read: One Thing That Could Slow Facebook Stock Down in 2018).“We're investing so much in security that it will impact our profitability. Protecting our community is more important than maximizing our profits,” Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a recent earnings call. “We already have about 10,000 people working on safety and security, and we're planning to double that to 20,000 in the next year to better enforce our Community Standards and review ads.”Meanwhile, Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) was recently compelled to publish a blog post explaining the details of its “differential privacy” practices, which are the company’s own strategies to protect user information—especially sensitive information like keystrokes and traffic history.Apple first introduced differential privacy in iOS 10 to support data collection that aims to improve QuickType, emoji, and media playback within Safari. In the company’s own words, differential privacy is “rooted in the idea that carefully calibrated noise can mask a user’s data.”“When many people submit data, the noise that has been added averages out and meaningful information emerges,” Apple continued.The collection of this highly-sensitive data is enough to make users uneasy in these hyper-aware times for online privacy. Apple’s recent blog is the seventh post in its “Privacy at Scale” series that attempts to explain its security techniques.Elsewhere, Twitter continues to find itself in the hot seat over its sluggish response to an influx of Russian bot accounts on its platform. According to the Daily Beast, the Jack Dorsey-led company had not provided congressional investigators with information on any additional Kremlin-linked bots nearly a month after identifying 36,746 such accounts at a hearing.It seems obvious that a social media company would want to reduce the number of malicious accounts on its website. But for Twitter, the problem has been attempting to draw the line between reasonable site maintenance and invading its users’ privacy.“The tools we use to fight malicious automation and disinformation have to be both globally applicable and scalable for the Twitter platform and the nearly half a billion Tweets served every day,” a Twitter spokesperson said. “We are constantly driving innovation and machine learning to improve our techniques in fighting these challenges across time zones and national borders. We also have to do all of this in a way that protects user privacy and security.”The security frustrations of Facebook, Apple, and Twitter are just a tiny sliver of a massive issue affecting every company that has the internet at the core of its business. The stakes are incredibly high right now, and it is an issue that will affect bottom lines throughout 2018—and beyond.As investors, we need to recognize this issue, as the bottom line performance of these companies affects our portfolios. And if you own any buy-and-hold internet stocks that you truly believe in, you might have to cut that company some slack when it decides to spend cash on security.Want more stock market analysis from this author?

153,EFX,"As the eventful 2017 comes to a close, we believe this is the right time to make your investment plans for the upcoming year. Among the various industries, we prefer cybersecurity stocks due to their remarkable run on the bourse, so far this year. The ETFMG Prime Cyber Security ETF (HACK  -  Free Report) is up 18.7% in the year-to-date period.A series of cyber attacks kept cybersecurity stocks hot throughout the year. Earlier in the year, there were two back-to-back ransomware attacks — WannaCry or WannaCrypt in May and Petya in June — followed by the massive data breach at Equifax (EFX  -  Free Report) in September. In addition to these, the disclosed data theft and ransom paid by Uber last month has further fueled the momentum.Notably, these data breaches were a reality check, showing how cyber attacks can escalate companies’ market and operational risks as well as tarnish the brand image. Hence, the firms now understand the immediate need for stricter security measures, which, we believe, will compel companies to further increase spending on cyber security.Per a recently-released report by Gartner, global enterprise security spending will reach $96.3 billion in 2018 — marking 8% growth from the 2017 expected level of $89 billion. Another market research firm, Markets and Markets in its July 2017 report stated that worldwide cybersecurity spending will likely reach $137.85 billion in 2017 and $231.94 billion by 2022.Encouragingly, cybersecurity companies will be the ultimate gainers due to this elevated spending. Here, we have picked three stocks which have the potentials to make the most of this opportunity and retain their impressive share price momentum in 2018 as well.FireEye Inc. (FEYE  -  Free Report) is a specialized provider of security platform against cyber-attacks to enterprises and governments. The company’s continued efforts toward bringing in new and advanced products have been attracting a wide range of customers.Additionally, last year’s acquisition of iSIGHT Partners has strengthened the company’s capabilities by offering an intelligence-led security model for enterprises of any size that other security providers find difficult to match. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has also taken over Invotas — a firm specializing in improving response times following a cyber-attack. Its product — Security Orchestrator — is designed to compile information from a range of security products and automate responses when an incident occurs.Check Point Software Technologies Ltd. (CHKP  -  Free Report) has evolved into a well-known provider of information technology (IT) security solutions across the world. The heightening security threats and potential hacking attacks led the company to turn to Software Blade architecture in 2009 from an appliance-led model. The company’s blade architecture is becoming increasingly popular as it enables customers to choose from an archive of software blades and customize the solution to suit users’ requirements.Rapid adoption of Check Point’s data-center appliances and consistent enhancements in data-center product lines are anticipated to provide ample top-line support. The company’s focus on boosting mobile capabilities will enable it to tap brighter prospects. The stock carries a Zacks Rank of 3. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (PANW  -  Free Report) enables firms, service providers and government bodies to impose tighter security measures through its network security platform. The company has been growing rapidly on the back of its innovative next-generation security platforms. Its security platforms have innovative traffic classification engines that help the company identify network traffic through application, user and content.Palo Alto’s security platforms simplify security infrastructure for organizations by eliminating the need for multiple, stand-alone security appliances, and software products. This reduces the total cost of ownership, thereby giving the organization a competitive edge.Also, we believe the company’s strategic acquisitions of LightCyber, Morta Security and Cyvera will continue to bolster revenues. These acquisitions helped this Zacks Rank #3 company expand the functionality of its enterprise security platform, in turn bringing in more and more customers.In addition to the above, Palo Alto has made strategic partnerships with the likes of VMware and Aruba Networks to expedite growth. These strategic partnerships bring in customers for Palo Alto, thus boosting its top line.Bottom LineConsidering the above discussed factors, it makes sense to invest in this hot industry group as cybersecurity players are likely to witness sturdy growth in the near term.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions. Apple sold a mere 1 billion iPhones in 10 years but a new breakthrough is expected to generate more than 27 billion devices in just 3 years, creating a $1.7 trillion market.Zacks has just released a Special Report that spotlights this fast-emerging phenomenon and 6 tickers for taking advantage of it.

154,EFX,"There are only a few more weeks of trading left in 2017, and as investors start to close the book on another bullish year for the stock market, it is clear that technology behemoths have dominated Wall Street. Of these, one of the year’s strongest stocks has been Facebook, Inc. (FB  -  Free Report).The market established Facebook as king of the social media world years ago, but in 2017, the Mark Zuckerberg-led company took another step in establishing itself as a diversified leader in the tech sector. The stock is now widely regarded as a must-own internet play, and recent investments seem poised to keep Facebook on the cutting edge for years to come.Shares of this Silicon Valley giant have gained more than 55% year-to-date. Based on our current consensus estimates, we expect the company’s fiscal 2017 to conclude with earnings growth of 37% and revenue growth of 45%.But it has not been entirely smooth sailing for Facebook in 2017. Indeed, the social media platform found itself embroiled in several of its fiercest public relations scandals on record—including one that threatens to slow the red-hot stock down in 2018.Throughout the year, Facebook has been forced to answer questions related to the use of its website to spread disinformation during the 2016 presidential campaign cycle. As it turns out, a large part of Russia’s concentrated efforts to interfere in the U.S. election took place on public internet forums, and new findings suggest that many American Facebook users were subjected to the country’s propaganda campaign.On top of this, increased public scrutiny over data security, punctuated by the devastating Equifax (EFX  -  Free Report) breach this year, has the entire internet industry rethinking how it protects its users’ private information.Facebook has already received criticism—from lawmakers and the general public—for its failure to properly vet content on its website. Now, the company is slated to increase spending on security and double down on its initiatives to prevent abuse.“Our community continues to grow and our business is doing well,” Zuckerberg said in Facebook’s latest earnings release. “But none of that matters if our services are used in ways that don't bring people closer together. We're serious about preventing abuse on our platforms. We're investing so much in security that it will impact our profitability. Protecting our community is more important than maximizing our profits.”Management would expand on this in its most recent earnings call, detailing plans to increase total expenses by 45% to 60% in 2018. While some of that new spending will go towards ongoing video content, augmented reality, and artificial intelligence projects, a sizeable chunk of it will be dedicated to security investments.“We're doing a lot here with investments both in people and technology. Some of this is focused on finding bad actors and bad behavior. Some is focused on removing false news, hate speech, bullying, and other problematic content that we don't want in our community,” Zuckerberg added.“We already have about 10,000 people working on safety and security, and we're planning to double that to 20,000 in the next year to better enforce our Community Standards and review ads.”In short, the biggest thing weighing on Facebook shares in 2018 will be Wall Street grappling with the fact that the company will not be as profitable as it probably could be. Nevertheless, Facebook should still witness solid top and bottom line growth next year.Based on our latest consensus estimates, Facebook is expected to post full-year 2018 earnings of $6.55 per share and revenues of $53.90 billion, which would represent year-over-year growth rates of +12.48% and +34.16% from 2017’s projected totals.How exactly will investors react to the company’s increased spending? Only time will tell.Want more stock market analysis from this author?

155,EFX,"Investor reaction to Equifax Inc.’s (EFX  -  Free Report) latest quarterly results were mixed as evident from yesterday’s late-hour trade. Following the company’s third-quarter 2017 results, the stock fell approximately 2.5%, then recovered and went up to nearly 1%. Finally, at the close of after-hour trading, it was down less than 1%.Analysts and investors were waiting for the credit information provider’s third-quarter results to have a better picture of the impact of the data breach incident on the company’s financial performance. Notably, this September, Equifax announced that very sensitive personal data of approximately 143 million consumers has been stolen from its database.The company recorded $87.5 million of costs related to the data breach, which was the main reason behind the 27.5% decline in its third-quarter GAAP earnings. The company reported GAAP earnings of 79 cents, down from $1.09 posted in the year-ago quarter.Equifax stated that it is still not sure how much its bottom-line results have been impacted by the above-mentioned data breach. In its 10-Q filing with the Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC), the company reported that over 240 class-action lawsuits have been filed against Equifax. It is currently facing probe from a number of investigating agencies and regulators.However, SEC’s rule of reporting financial results on a non-GAAP basis gave it a scope to overshadow the debacle. On non-GAAP basis (which excludes one-time items including the costs related to data breach), the company managed to report year-over-year earnings growth.Equifax’s non-GAAP earnings of $1.53 per share came in 6.3% higher than the year-ago quarter. Moreover, quarterly earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.49 and were toward the upper-end of management’s guidance rage of $1.50-$1.54 (midpoint: $1.52).It is quite possible that investors will have different opinions on the company’s bottom-line results, which may have resulted in such volatility during yesterday’s late-hour trade. Furthermore, it is possible that investors will be waiting for the third-quarter earnings conference call, which is scheduled to be held today before the market opens, for a better view on its growth prospects.Notably, the stock is on a downtrend since it reported the data-breach incident on Sep 8. It has lost 23.7% of its value since then, while the industry to which it belongs to has gained 6.4%.Let’s discuss quarterly results in detail.RevenuesEquifax’s top-line performance was also not impressive. Revenues of $834.8 million missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $847 million as well as management’s guided range of $853-$861 million. Although, the figure was up 3.8% on a year-over-year basis, it was the slowest growth rate in the last several quarters.Lackluster top-line performance was mainly due to the dismal performance at its U.S. Information Solutions (USIS) division which registered a year-over-year 3% decline in revenues to $307.7 million, reflecting a complete sign of impact from the data-breach scandal. The division witnessed revenue decline at all its sub-segments. Revenues from Online Information Solutions, Mortgage Solutions Services and Financial Marketing Services dropped 4%, 2% and 1%, respectively.However, the company’s other segments continue to perform well.Revenues from the International division (including Europe, the Asia Pacific, Canada and Latin America) advanced 12% year over year to $239.8 million. On a constant-currency basis, revenues increased 10%. Growth was mainly driven by the Veda Group acquisition, which increased the Asia-Pacific region’s contribution to revenues to $81.2 million, up 10% year over year. Moreover, revenues registered growth of 16%, 11% and 11% in Latin America, Canada and Europe, respectively.Revenues from the Workforce Solutions segment climbed 9% year over year to $186.4 million, primarily on the back of 13% revenue growth in Verification Services. Revenues from Employer Services remained flat year over year.Global Consumer Solutions contributed $100.9 million to total revenues. The figure was flat on a year-over-year basis.Operating ResultsEquifax’s adjusted EBITDA increased approximately 8.1% to $312.5 million. Adjusted operating EBITDA margin expanded 150 basis points (bps) to 37.4%. Adjusted net income came in at $185.9 million or $1.53 per share compared with $175.2 million or $1.44 per share reported a year ago.Equifax, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Equifax, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Equifax, Inc. QuoteBalance Sheet & Cash FlowEquifax exited the reported quarter with $315.4 million in cash and cash equivalents, down from the previous quarter’s balance of $403.9 million. Total long-term debt (excluding current portion) was $2.04 billion, flat quarter over quarter. During the nine-month period ended Sep 30, 2017, Equifax generated cash flow of $508.7 million from operational activities.In the first three quarters, the company paid dividend of $140.7 million. Also, Equifax’s board of directors approved a quarterly cash dividend of 39 cents to be payable on Dec 15 to shareholders of record date as of Nov 24. Notably, the company has a history of paying quarterly dividend for more than 100 years.Our TakeWe believe that due to ongoing uncertainty the company has not provided outlook for the forthcoming quarter. Therefore, we will have to wait for the company’s conference call today to have a clearer picture about its future prospects.Its escalating expenses related to the cyber attack will remain a drag on the company’s profitability. Also, per its 10-Q filing, the company expects to incur more expenses in the form of legal and professional services associated with the data-breach incident. Furthermore, it stated that its expenses might flare up due to increased investments in IT and security solutions as well as insurance services.The brand image and creditability of Equifax has been in question and is facing huge customer criticism, while cybersecurity companies are questioning its preparedness and response to the massive data breach. Moreover, with lawmakers and investigating agencies probing the mishap, its troubles are unlikely to end any time soon.We believe the entire issue may result in loss of customers and the company may also have to make huge compensation to its clients. This may have an adverse impact on the company’s financial performance in the near term.Currently, Equifax carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Some better-ranked stocks in the same space include Envestnet, Inc. (ENV  -  Free Report), Global Payments Inc. (GPN  -  Free Report) and Total System Services Inc. (TSS  -  Free Report), all carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

156,EFX,"Symantec Corporation (SYMC  -  Free Report) is slated to release second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Nov 1.The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at 43 cents, which represents year-over-year growth of 42.2%. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the past 30 days. Additionally, analysts polled by Zacks project revenues of roughly $1.28 billion, up 30.6% from the year-ago quarter level.Rise in demand for cybersecurity-related products due to the recent global hacking events, along with acquisitions, are likely to drive Symantec’s fiscal second-quarter overall results. However, divestment of the company’s high-margin certified authority business may undermine profitability.Symantec Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Symantec Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Symantec Corporation QuoteTo Benefit From Rising DemandCybersecurity companies stand to gain from data breaches as chances of security-related purchases shoot up. The demand for cybersecurity-related products have got fresh momentum by the two back-to-back ransomware attacks — WannaCry or WannaCrypt in May and Petya in June — which created global havoc.Apart from this, data breach at Equifax Inc. (EFX  -  Free Report), which was discovered this September, is likely to have a positive impact on cybersecurity-related products’ demand, particularly identity protection security providers. Symantec, which has been enhancing its identity-theft protection capabilities through acquisitions like LifeLock, will surely have cashed on this opportunity.Acquisitions to Drive RevenuesSymantec has taken the acquisition route to redeem its struggling business. In the last few quarters, the company acquired businesses like Blue Coat, LifeLock, Skycure and Fireglass. The acquisitions have helped Symantec broaden its product portfolio and enhance the company’s capabilities in areas such as identity, mobile and web protection, which is currently a huge concern for almost every sector, be it financials, retail or technology.The buyouts have helped it reduce its dependency on the PC market and strengthen position in the enterprise security market. It should be noted that the company was facing severe competition from Palo-Alto Networks and FireEye in the enterprise segment market.Additionally, the acquisitions have broadened Symantec’s customer base. Therefore, we anticipate this strategy to drive the company’s to-be-reported quarters’ revenues and earnings.Website Security Divestment Might Hurt profitabilityDuring the first-quarter fiscal 2018 results, Symantec announced that privately-owned DigiCert Inc. has agreed to buy its Website Security business for $950 million in cash and approximately a 30% stake in the latter’s business. Symantec’s Website Security solution verifies the identity of websites. We believe the latest move is Symantec’s effort to end the ongoing dispute with Alphabet’s (GOOGL  -  Free Report) Google, which has accused it for mis-issuing over 30,000 of web certifications. However, it should be noted that the company’s certified authority business was a very high-margin business. Therefore, we are increasingly cautious that the loss of high margin associated with this business may drag Symantec’s profitability in the near future.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Symantec is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Symantec has an Earnings ESP of +0.78% but carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Notably, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stock With Favorable CombinationAs per our model, NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA  -  Free Report) has the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter. The stock has an Earnings ESP of +0.53% and a Zacks Rank #1.

157,EFX,"Fiserv Inc. (FISV  -  Free Report) is set to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 31.Last quarter, earnings of $1.19 per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.23. However, it improved 10.2% from the year-ago quarter. Notably, the company has beaten the Zack Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, delivering an average positive surprise of 0.89%.Total revenue increased approximately 1.7% year over year to $1.39 billion but missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.42 billion.Notably, shares of Fiserv have gained 20.7% year to date, significantly underperforming the industry’s 31.8% rally.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Key FactorsFiserv holds a dominant position in the financial and payment solutions business backed by a broad customer base and key contract wins. We believe product-oriented acquisitions will drive growth for the company.Reportedly, in the third quarter, Fiserv completed the acquisitions of Monitise, PCLender and Dovetail Group.Moreover, Fiserv’s focus on expanding its product portfolio is also a positive. We believe the company’s launch of products like Prologue Credit Loss Manager, Instant Issue Advantage and Integrator Advance in the September quarter to have led to a steady flow of customers.Further, Fiserv’s digital banking solutions are gaining momentum among the financial institutions. The company announced in August that its Statement Advantage solution has been selected by about 600 banks and credit unions.However, we note that lower termination fees, EMV deferral and adverse foreign currency translations are negatively impacting the company’s sales.Moreover, increasing regulations in the banking and financial services industry and intensifying competition from the likes of Equifax Inc. (EFX  -  Free Report) and Fidelity National Information Services Inc. (FIS  -  Free Report) remain concerns. Given the attractive prospects in the financial services market, there are always new entrants who seek to leverage on shifts in technology or product innovation to attract customers.Fiserv’s policy of acquiring a large number of companies results in some integration risk. The company’s highly leveraged balance sheet will continue to weigh on its profitability.Fiserv, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Fiserv, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Fiserv, Inc. QuoteWhat Our Model SaysAccording to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP. The Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or #5) are best avoided. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Fiserv has an Earnings ESP of +0.44% and a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Therefore, our proven model does not conclusively show that the company is likely to deliver a positive surprise this quarter.A Key Stock to ConsiderHere is a company that you may also want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in their upcoming release:Kemet Corporation (KEM  -  Free Report) with an Earnings ESP of +7.46% and a Zacks Rank #1.

158,EFX,"Markets posted losses on Thursday following a decline in financial shares after banks tanked. Such losses were buoyed by decline in shares of JPMorgan and Citigroup. Further, shares of AT&T also declined and weighed on the broader markets. Meanwhile, initial jobless claims plummeted to hit a six-week low after business resumed in Texas and Florida — areas pummeled by two destructive hurricanes.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) closed at 22,841.01, declining 0.1%. The S&P 500 Index (INX) decreased 0.2% to close at 2,550.93. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite Index (IXIC) closed at 6,591.51, decreasing 0.2%. A total of 6 billion shares were traded on Thursday, lower than the last 20-session average of 6.1 billion shares. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1.22-to-1 ratio. On the Nasdaq, decliners outnumbered advancers by 1.10-to-1 ratio. The CBOE VIX increased 0.5% to close at 9.9.Benchmarks Post Losses After Bank Shares SwoonThe S&P 500 lost 4.31 points on Thursday to end in the negative territory. Of the 11 major sectors of the S&P 500, six ended in the red with financial and consumer discretionary shares leading the laggards. The Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLF) and the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLY) declined 0.8% and 0.7%, respectively. Financial sector tanked following a nosedive in bank shares. Shares of JPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report) and Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) declined 0.9% and 3.4%, respectively and weighed heavily on the broader markets. Both the companies possess a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.JPMorgan reported its third quarter earnings on Thursday, comfortably beating the expectations. However, the stock declined after the company’s fixed income trading revenue dipped around 27% to come in at $3.2 billion in the third quarter of this year. Meanwhile, Citigroup also reported third quarter earnings, surpassing the market expectations. However, the stock declined after the company’s operating expenses declined about 2% and the cost of credit increased 15% due to global consumer banking as well as high credit reserve build. Such losses weighed heavily on the financial sector.Moreover, weighing on the markets was a decline in shares of AT&T (T  -  Free Report), which lost 5.7%. Such losses followed an announcement from the company that it lost approximately 90,000 video subscribers within the United States in the third quarter in the wake of two big hurricanes and also because of stiff competition in the market. This weighed heavily on the telecom sector.The Dow declined almost 32 points to finish in the red and the Nasdaq ended 12.04 points lower to end in the negative territory.New Economic DataThe weekly initial jobless claims plummeted to 243,000 from last week — a decline of 15,000. This marked its lowest level in as many as six weeks. The consensus estimate for the period was 255,000 claims. Economists commented that only a few Americans applied for unemployment benefits in this period as business resumed in Texas and Florida, with more people resuming work, post the recent carnage by two destructive hurricanes.Moreover, initial claims in Puerto Rico were also lower not because of people going back to work but due to the absence of electricity after the island was ravaged by Hurricane Maria. Consequently, people could not file claims from the island nor could the claims be processed. As a result, the analysts expect such claims to show up in the coming weeks.Meanwhile, the Core PPI for the month of September increased by 0.4%, up from 0.1% in August. The consensus estimate for the period was 0.2%. However, PPI for September increased by 0.4%, in line with the consensus estimate for the period.Stocks That Made HeadlinesHP Inc Shares Jump on Positive Fiscal 2018 OutlookThe world’s largest PC manufacturer, HP Inc. (HPQ  -  Free Report), provided fiscal 2018 outlook in its recent Securities Analyst Meeting.

159,EFX,"Shares of Equifax Inc. (EFX  -  Free Report) fell yesterday after the website — Ars Technica — reported that the credit information provider may have been subject to another cyber attack. Per Ars Technica, Randy Abrams, an independent security analyst, discovered that the company’s web site is prompting to install Adobe’s (ADBE  -  Free Report) Flash updates which has been found containing malware.Following the above discussed report, the company’s shares were seen tumbling around 3% during mid-day on Thursday. However, later in the day, the stock recovered almost half of the loss, after Equifax announced that it is not subject to any another cyber attack and its systems have not been compromised.Equifax’s spokesmen Wyatt Jefferies said that the company was “aware of the situation identified on the Equifax.com Web site in the credit-report assistance link.” He further added, ""Our IT and security teams are looking into this matter, and out of an abundance of caution have temporarily taken this page offline.""The company in a statement noted that, “The issue involves a third-party vendor that Equifax uses to collect website performance data, and that vendor’s code running on an Equifax website was serving malicious content.” Equifax further stated that the vendor’s code has been removed from its webpage and it is conducting further analysis on this matter.Notably, the brand image and creditability of Equifax has already been in question ever since the company announced last month that very sensitive personal data of approximately 143 million consumers has been stolen from its database.Since then, Equifax has been facing huge customer criticism, while cybersecurity companies are questioning its preparedness and response to this massive data breach. Moreover, with lawmakers and investigating agencies probing the mishap, its troubles are unlikely to end any time soon.Shares of Equifax have lost approximately 24% of its value from the Sep 7 closing price. In the year-to-date period, the company has lost 8%, significantly underperforming the industry to which it belongs to, which has recorded growth of 31.7%.Investors seem concerned that the entire issue may result in loss of customers and the company may also have to make huge compensation to its clients. It is feared that this will have an adverse impact on the company’s financial performance in the near term.Sensitivity of the information exposed in Equifax’s data breach case makes it one of the worst cases in recent times. The latest data breach at the company will likely have a lasting impact as criminals can use the stolen resources for opening new accounts, applying for credit cards or loans, buying insurance, renting an apartment or even for tax frauds.It should be noted that banks and financial institutions rely on the United States’ three main consumer credit reporting agencies — Equifax, TransUnion (TRU  -  Free Report) and Experian. Therefore, with access to social security, driver’s license and credit card numbers, criminals can make such frauds due to which consumers will have to suffer for longer periods of time.Hence, we believe investors’ concerns are justified as the mishap will have a lasting impact on Equifax’s results, in the form of financial costs relating to settlement of lawsuits and litigation expenses. Moreover, it will be very tough for the company to repair its brand image, as well as retain the current customer base.Currently, Equifax carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).A better-ranked stock in the same industry is Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (FIS  -  Free Report) which carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

160,EFX,"Akamai Technologies Inc (AKAM  -  Free Report) is strengthening its security product portfolio. The company recently announced plans to acquire Nominum, a leading provider of DNS and enterprise security solutions for carriers.Akamai intends to integrate Nominum’s carrier-grade cybersecurity solutions with its enterprise security offerings and threat intelligence. This will help the company in expanding its presence among carrier and enterprise customers.Nominum is well-known for three of its DNS security products – Vantio CacheServer, Big Data Connector, and Vantio AuthServe. These products face competition from Cisco Systems Inc’s (CSCO  -  Free Report) OpenDNS Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) offering and Infoblox.Akamai believes that the integrated security product portfolio will be more effective in identifying, blocking and mitigating malware, ransomware, phishing as well as data exfiltration threats.However, Nominum’s acquisition will be dilutive to Akamai’s fourth-quarter earnings by almost a nickel. The acquisition is anticipated to negatively impact fiscal 2018 earnings by 11 cents. The company still expects to maintain EBITDA margin range within mid-30’s including Nominum. Moreover, management expects the buyout to be accretive in fiscal 2019.Notably, Akamai’s shares have lost 24.2% of its value year to date versus the 25.6% increase of its industry.Security: Key Catalyst for AkamaiSecurity is an area that holds a lot of promise for Akamai in our view. The cyber attacks at Equifax Inc (EFX  -  Free Report), Avast’s CCleaner and two back-to-back ransomware attacks — WannaCry or WannaCrypt in May and Petya in June — created global chaos, recently.We believe that the urgency for stricter security measures will compel enterprises as well as governments to increase spending on cybersecurity software. According to a Markets and Markets July-2017 report, worldwide cybersecurity spending will reach $137.85 billion this year and $231.94 billion by 2022. The solid spending trend bodes well for Akamai.We believe that the expanded security portfolio will help Akamai gain significant share in the security market in the long haul. Notably, the company’s cloud security business reported revenues of $115 million that increased 34% from the year-ago quarter.In the last quarter, the company launched two products — Enterprise Threat Protector and Bot Manager Premier. Akamai expects revenues from the security business to exceed $1 billion within the next four to five years driven by strong adoption of Kona Site Defender, Prolexic, Bot Manager and Web Application Protector product offerings.Moreover, expansion of the security product portfolio will lower Akamai’s dependence on the media delivery solutions. Further, rapid growth in security is expected to offset loss of large customers in the content delivery network (CDN) space.Zacks Rank & Key PickCurrently, Akamai has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

161,EFX,"Fresh off his Nobel Prize for Economics, University of Chicago Professor Richard Thaler has admitted to being puzzled and worried about the current market exuberance. “We seem to be living in the riskiest moment of our lives, and yet the stock market seems to be napping.” Thaler says he doesn’t understand it; anyone paying attention to global risks today surely would have made some investment adjustments by now. Yet stock indexes remain near all-time highs.Thaler proved that human beings are “predictably irrational,” helping shed light on how sound investment strategies can go awry. “Economic agents are human, and …economic models have to incorporate that,” Thaler was quoted as saying about his award-winning work. So what is it Thaler is so worried about now?In an interview with Bloomberg, Thaler explains his is puxzzled by not only record highs in the main indexes, but extremely low volatility as well. Outside forces have not been able to correct for potential headwinds or roadblocks; from a massive data breach at Equifax (EFX  -  Free Report) to saber-rattling between President Trump and North Korea’s Kim Jong-un regarding nuclear annihilation, nothing has been able to move the needle deeply to the negative, nor for long. Failures of major policy shifts in Congress — including repealing and replacing Obamacare, as well as sound immigration reform — have added to this perceived wall of worry.On top of this, we’ve seen an extraordinary amount of natural disasters in the Western Hemisphere in just the past 60 days — hurricanes in the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico, earthquakes outside Mexico City, and now devastating wildfires in Northern California — which are costing lives and livelihoods, and will require extraordinary capital outlays to make these regions whole again. And finally, the looming shadow of the investigation into Russia’s involvement with the Trump administration in affecting last November’s U.S. General Election has yet to be brought to light.So what does Thaler see as the biggest risk the stock market is avoiding currently, the one that is most likely to set a correction into play from our current lofty levels? “Surely [the markets’ record highs] can’t be based on the certitude that there will be a massive tax cut, given the seeming inability of the Republican Congress to get their act together.” Meaning Thaler thinks that, as with healthcare and immigration reform previously this year, Congress will again be unable to bring forth meaningful change on tax reform. And if this results in no windfall corporate tax cut — this year, next year, or ever — chances are this reality will set in and manifest as a new downward trend.President Trump will give an address this evening regarding his tax reform proposals, including how many Americans will stand to receive $4000 as a result of new tax policy. But deficit hawks on the right will not see much benefit in putting an additional $1-2 trillion back onto the books just to score a near-term cash windfall. And this is before even discussing whether anyone on the left side of the congressional aisle will have any interest in providing fiscal benefits to multi-billion-dollar corporations.

163,EFX,"Investors in Equifax Inc. (EFX  -  Free Report) need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Sep 22, 2017 $85 Put had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Equifax shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Equifax is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Financial Transaction Services industry that ranks in the Top 30% of our Zacks Industry Rank. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter has declined from $1.53 per share to $1.51 in the last 60 days.Given the way analysts feel about Equifax right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Often times, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Each week, our very own Dave Bartosiak gives his top options trades.

165,EFX,"Proofpoint Inc. (PFPT  -  Free Report) has demonstrated scintillating share price performance over the last two years. The stock, which was valued at $63 at the beginning of 2016, now currently trades close to $123, representing an approximately two-fold jump.Year to date, Proofpoint’s shares have appreciated nearly 41.6%, way better than the S&P 500’s gain of 3.8%. The stock has also outperformed its industry which recorded growth of 29.9% during the same time frame.This remarkable run can be primarily attributed to the company’s stellar financial performances. Notably, Proofpoint’s last quarterly results marked the ninth consecutive quarter of better-than-expected performance for the top and bottom lines. This apart, the company has witnessed significant year-over-year improvement on both the counts in these quarters as well. Let’s take a look at what factors are driving Proofpoint’s back-to-back impressive quarterly performances.Increased Migration to Office 365As more and more enterprises are migrating to cloud, demand for healthier cyber-security measures has been on the rise. For the past few quarters, Proofpoint has been witnessing strong demand for its cyber-security suites from enterprises transitioning to cloud, particularly to Microsoft’s (MSFT  -  Free Report) Office 365.Per the company, customers are looking for additional security capabilities that “complement and enhance the baseline solutions provided by Microsoft.” During 2017, a number of enterprises, which migrated to Office 365, bought the company’s security suit, including a significant number of Fortune 500 enterprises.We expect this bullish momentum to continue through 2018 as well, thereby boosting Proofpoint’s Protection and Advanced Threat segment’s top-line performance.Acquisitions Driving RevenuesProofpoint has made strategic acquisitions to expedite growth. In February 2018, the company signed a definitive agreement to buy Wombat Security Technologies, Inc. In 2017, the company made two important buyouts, Cloudmark, specializing in providing security protection for messaging services, and Weblife.io, a leader in browser isolation solutions. In 2016, the company acquired two businesses — FireLayers and the Email Fraud Protection (EFP) business unit from Return Path.The aforementioned buyouts have not only expanded Proofpoint’s product portfolio, but also its customer and revenue base as well. We believe the company will continue its strategy of growing through acquisitions, which will help drive revenues.Healthy Cybersecurity MarketRising incidents of cyber attacks are benefiting Proofpoint as government and organizations have increased their security-related spending. Some of the most notable cyber attacks in the recent past include the two massive ransomware attacks — WannaCrypt or WannaCry in May 2017 and Petya in June 2017 — and one major data breach at Equifax (EFX  -  Free Report) reported in September 2017.In early 2018, Expedia (EXPE  -  Free Report) reported a data breach where hackers stole customers’ information of 880K payment cards used on its consumer platform, as well as the partner’s platform where Orbitz is used as a booking engine.All these have spurred demand for security-related products among enterprises and governments across the world. Per the latest research report from Gartner (IT), worldwide cybersecurity spending is likely to reach $96 billion in 2018 — marking 8% growth from the 2017 level of $89 billion. Another report from Markets and Markets suggests that the cyber security market is expected to witness CAGR of 11% in the 2017-2022 period.We believe the demand for cyber-security solutions bodes well for Proofpoint as it will bring in new customers, thereby boosting its top-line performance.Proofpoint currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

166,EFX,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Equifax, Inc. (EFX  -  Free Report).

Earnings of $1.43 per share beat the consensus mark by 6 cents but declined 0.7% year over year. The year-over-year decline in the bottom line was due to buyout-related amortization expenses and costs associated with the investigation, rectification, legal and professional services and improved security services in relation to the cybersecurity incident.These headwinds offset the benefit from the new tax (Tax Cuts and Jobs Act) law. The company enjoyed a tax benefit of $3 million in first-quarter 2018. Notably, the company’s bottom line exceeded the guidance by 4 cents.

167,EFX,"Equifax Inc. (EFX  -  Free Report) shares have declined 15.7% over the past year against 34.9% increase recorded by the industry. Last year’s cyber-attack at Equifax, which resulted in theft of highly-sensitive personal data of approximately 143 million consumers, has heavily tarnished the brand image, reputation and credibility of the company.Equifax’s first-quarter 2018 earnings faced the brunt of a data breach, with the company’s earnings of $1.43, recording a 0.7% decline year over year. However, Its earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 6 cents. Revenues of $865.7 million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $854 million, and moved up 4.1% year over year on a reported basis and 3% on a local-currency basis.Notably, Equifax has an impressive earnings surprise history. It surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 3%. However, for the second quarter, the company’s consensus estimates edged down 1.9 % in the past 30 days.Aftermath of Cyber Attack The company is facing huge customer criticism while cybersecurity companies are raising doubts over its preparedness and line of actions to the massive data breach. We believe that breach-related troubles for Equifax are unlikely to end any time soon.In the first quarter of 2018, the company’s adjusted EBITDA margin decreased 250 basis points (bps) year over year, reflecting higher operating expenses associated with the breach fallout. We believe that the incident will certainly have an adverse impact on the company’s financial performance in the near term.Equifax, Inc. Net Income (TTM) Equifax, Inc.

168,EFX,"Wednesday, October 11, 2017Fresh off his Nobel Prize for Economics, University of Chicago Professor Richard Thaler has admitted to being puzzled and worried about the current market exuberance. “We seem to be living in the riskiest moment of our lives, and yet the stock market seems to be napping.” Thaler says he doesn’t understand it; anyone paying attention to global risks today surely would have made some investment adjustments by now. Yet stock indexes remain near all-time highs.Thaler proved that human beings are “predictably irrational,” helping shed light on how sound investment strategies can go awry. “Economic agents are human, and …economic models have to incorporate that,” Thaler was quoted as saying about his award-winning work. So what is it Thaler is so worried about now?In an interview with Bloomberg, Thaler explains his is puxzzled by not only record highs in the main indexes, but extremely low volatility as well. Outside forces have not been able to correct for potential headwinds or roadblocks; from a massive data breach at Equifax (EFX  -  Free Report) to saber-rattling between President Trump and North Korea’s Kim Jong-un regarding nuclear annihilation, nothing has been able to move the needle deeply to the negative, nor for long. Failures of major policy shifts in Congress — including repealing and replacing Obamacare, as well as sound immigration reform — have added to this perceived wall of worry.On top of this, we’ve seen an extraordinary amount of natural disasters in the Western Hemisphere in just the past 60 days — hurricanes in the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico, earthquakes outside Mexico City, and now devastating wildfires in Northern California — which are costing lives and livelihoods, and will require extraordinary capital outlays to make these regions whole again. And finally, the looming shadow of the investigation into Russia’s involvement with the Trump administration in affecting last November’s U.S. General Election has yet to be brought to light.So what does Thaler see as the biggest risk the stock market is avoiding currently, the one that is most likely to set a correction into play from our current lofty levels? “Surely [the markets’ record highs] can’t be based on the certitude that there will be a massive tax cut, given the seeming inability of the Republican Congress to get their act together.” Meaning Thaler thinks that, as with healthcare and immigration reform previously this year, Congress will again be unable to bring forth meaningful change on tax reform. And if this results in no windfall corporate tax cut — this year, next year, or ever — chances are this reality will set in and manifest as a new downward trend.President Trump will give an address this evening regarding his tax reform proposals, including how many Americans will stand to receive $4000 as a result of new tax policy. But deficit hawks on the right will not see much benefit in putting an additional $1-2 trillion back onto the books just to score a near-term cash windfall. And this is before even discussing whether anyone on the left side of the congressional aisle will have any interest in providing fiscal benefits to multi-billion-dollar corporations.Mark VickerySenior EditorQuestions or comments about this article and/or its author?

172,EFX,"Equifax Inc. (EFX  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 25, after market close.We expect expanding data and machine learning-based analytics solutions, increased penetration in the identity and fraud prevention market and continuous expansion of its verification business to drive its top line in the to-be reported quarter. The bottom line is likely to decline due to buyout-related amortization expenses and costs associated with the cybersecurity incident.We observe that shares of Equifax have rallied 11.2% over the past six months, significantly outperforming the S&P 500’s gain of 4.7%. Top Line to Improve Year Over YearEquifax operates through four segments — U.S. Information Solutions (USIS), International, Workforce Solutions and Global Consumer Solutions. While we expect strong performance of International and Workforce Solutions segments in the to-be-reported quarter on a year-over-year basis, the company’s business from USIS and Global Consumer Solutions are likely to decline.Revenues from the International division (including Europe, the Asia Pacific, Canada and Latin America) are expected to increase on the back of its expanding data and machine learning-based analytics solutions in Europe, Canada and Latin America, increased coverage in Australian and Latin American fraud prevention market and growing potential in debt management across the world. Revenues from product launches is another key growth catalyst. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for this segment’s revenues is pegged at $243 million, reflecting year-over-year growth of 12.5%.In fourth-quarter 2017, segment revenues advanced 15% year over year to $244.8 million.Revenues from the Workforce Solutions segment are likely to improve driven by continuous expansion of its verification business with progressive work culture and increasing associations, coupled with global expansion into Canadian and Australian markets. Within the segment, the Employer Services unit is likely to witness increase in hiring and on-boarding solutions. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for this segment’s revenues is pegged at $212 million, reflecting year-over-year growth of 6%.In fourth-quarter 2017, segment revenues climbed 6% year over year to $183.4 million (inclusive of 11% sales growth in Verification Services and 5% decline at Employer Services).Revenues from USIS division are expected to decline owing to a decline in mortgage market activity and the negative impact of the cybersecurity incident. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for this segment’s revenues is pegged at $306 million, reflecting year-over-year decline of 1.3%.In fourth-quarter 2017, segment revenues suffered a 1% year-over-year decline to $313 million.Revenues from Global Consumer Solutions segment are likely to get affected by a declining subscriber base.  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for this segment’s revenues is pegged at $93 million, reflecting a year-over-year decline of 12.3%. In fourth-quarter 2017, segment revenues amounted to $97.3 million, down 2% year over year.Strength across International and Workforce Solutions segments will contribute toward year-over-year growth of Equifax’s total revenues, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for which is currently pegged at $854.02 million, reflecting year-over-year growth of 2.6%.Notably, the consensus estimate falls within the company guided range of $850-$860 million, which reflects year-over-year growth of 2-3%. The guidance also includes a 1% benefit from foreign currency movements. In fourth-quarter 2017, revenues rose 4.7% from the year-ago quarter to $838.5 million. It included a 3% negative impact of the cybersecurity incident.Equifax, Inc. Revenue (TTM)  Equifax, Inc. Revenue (TTM) | Equifax, Inc. QuoteBottom Line to Decline Year Over YearThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share in the to-be-reported quarter is pegged at $1.37, indicating year-over-year decline of 4.9%.The decline is expected on the back of buyout-related amortization expenses and costs associated with the investigation, rectification, legal and professional services and improved security services in relation to the cybersecurity incident. Reduced benefits from foreign tax items are likely to act as another negative catalyst. Notably, these headwinds are expected to offset the tax benefits from the new tax (Tax Cuts and Jobs Act) law.Notably, the consensus estimate is in line with the midpoint of the previous guidance range. Equifax anticipates EPS for first-quarter 2018 to be in the range of $1.34-$1.39 (inclusive of a benefit of 1 cent from foreign currency movements). In fourth-quarter 2017, earnings declined 2% from the year-ago quarter to $1.39 per share.Our Model Doesn’t Suggest a BeatPlease note that according to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP.

Analysts polled by Zacks project revenues of roughly $152 million, up 34.3% from the year-ago quarter.Nonetheless, the earnings growth rate is likely to slow down in the to-be-reported quarter. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at 16 cents, representing year-over-year growth of 33.3%. Notably, in the fourth quarter of 2017, Proofpoint had registered non-GAAP earnings growth of 61%.We believe, although increased migration to Microsoft’s (MSFT  -  Free Report) Office 365 and a healthy cybersecurity market will drive the company’s top-line results, escalating expenses might dent profitability.Proofpoint, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Proofpoint, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Proofpoint, Inc. QuoteEscalating Costs to Impede ProfitabilityProofpoint recorded remarkable top-line growth in the past quarters, driven by healthy product demand, continued focus on product launches and acquisitions. However, the company’s escalating operating expenses continue to impact its bottom-line results.It should be noted that Proofpoint has invested heavily to enhance its sales and marketing capabilities, particularly by expanding the company’s sales force to survive in the highly competitive cyber-security market. Notably, the company’s sales and marketing expenses have recorded more than five-fold jump to $258.8 million in 2017 from $42.7 million in 2011. Also, operating expenses escalated more than six-fold to $441.4 million in 2017 from $71.7 million in 2011. This has impacted Proofpoint’s bottom-line performance.We expect soaring operating expense to partly mitigate the benefit of stellar revenue growth in the soon-to-be-reported quarter.Increased Migration to Office 365 to Drive RevenuesAs more enterprises are migrating to cloud, demand for better cyber-security measures is on the rise. For the last few quarters, Proofpoint has been witnessing solid demand for its cyber-security suites from enterprises which are transitioning to cloud, particularly to Microsoft's Office 365.Per the company, customers are looking for additional security capabilities that “complement and enhance the baseline solutions provided by Microsoft.” Throughout last year, a number of enterprises, which migrated to Office 365, bought the company’s security suits that also included a significant number of Fortune 500 enterprises.We anticipate this momentum to have continued into the first quarter as well, the favourable impact of which will likely reflect in the Protection and Advanced Threat segment’s top-line performance. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues for the segment is pegged at $115 million, which reflects a year-over-year jump of 36.9%.Healthy Cybersecurity MarketWe believe Proofpoint will continue to benefit from the increasing demand for cyber-security solutions, thanks to the slew of cyber attacks that hit the globe last year. It should be noted that in 2017, the world witnessed two back-to-back ransomware attacks, WannaCrypt or WannaCry in May, Petya in June, followed by the massive data breach at Equifax (EFX  -  Free Report) which was reported in September last year.All these have increased the demand for security-related products among enterprises and governments. Per the latest research report from Gartner (IT  -  Free Report), worldwide cybersecurity spending is likely to witness year-over-year growth of 8% this year and reach $96.3 billion.We believe the upswing in the overall cyber-security market bodes well for Proofpoint as it will bring in new customers, thereby boosting its top-line performance.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

174,EFX,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Equifax, Inc. (EFX  -  Free Report). Shares have added about 5.7% in that time frame.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is EFX due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Equifax Earnings and Revenues Beat Estimates in Q4Equifax reported fourth-quarter 2017 results, wherein revenues and non-GAAP earnings per share came ahead of the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate. This was the second quarterly results post the data breach incident. Notably, in September 2017, Equifax announced that very sensitive personal data of approximately 143 million consumers has been stolen from its database.During the fourth quarter, the company recorded $26.5 million of costs related to the data breach. Notably, in the third quarter it had incurred $87.5 million owing to the same.Despite incurring this huge cybersecurity expense, the company managed to record a year-over-year increase of 40.6% in GAAP earnings per share, courtesy of the latest Tax Cuts and Jobs Act benefit which lowered the effective tax rate. The company recorded a one-time tax benefit of $48.3 million due to the recent tax enactment. On a GAAP basis, Equifax reported earnings of $1.42 per share, up from $1.01 posted in the year-ago quarter.However, on non-GAAP basis (which excludes one-time items including the costs related to data breach and benefit from lower effective tax rate) the company’s non-GAAP earnings came at $1.39 per share, 3 cents lower than the earnings of $1.42 reported in fourth-quarter 2016. Here, it should be noted that the fall would have been much more, but the Securities & Exchange Commission‘s (“SEC”) rule of reporting financial results on non-GAAP basis gave it a scope to somewhat mitigate the debacle. Equifax’s non-GAAP earnings came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.35.Let’s discuss quarterly results in detail.RevenuesEquifax’s revenues of $838.5 million surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $825 million marking a year-over-year improvement of 4.7%. However, it should be noted that this was the second slowest growth rate in the last several quarters after the 3.8% it registered in third-quarter 2017.Lackluster top-line performance was mainly due to the dismal performance at its U.S. Information Solutions (USIS) division which suffered a year-over-year 1% decline in revenues to $313 million, highlighting the impact of the data-breach scandal. The division suffered revenue decline of 9% at Mortgage Solutions Services sub-segment, while sales at Online Information Solutions remained flat year over year and at Financial Marketing Services witnessed 1% increase.Revenues declined at Global Consumer Solutions and in turn dented overall sales growth. Revenues at this division plunged 2% year over year to $97.3 million.However, the company’s other segments continue to perform well.Revenues from the International division (including Europe, the Asia Pacific, Canada and Latin America) advanced 15% year over year to $244.8 million. On a constant-currency basis, revenues increased 12%. The company registered growth at every international region with revenues increasing 10%, 16%, 18% and 17% in Asia-Pacific, Latin America, Canada and Europe, respectively.Revenues from the Workforce Solutions segment climbed 6% year over year to $183.4 million, primarily on the back of 11% sales growth in Verification Services, partially offset by a 5% decline at Employer Services.Operating ResultsEquifax’s adjusted EBITDA remained flat year over year at $292 million. However, adjusted EBITDA margin contracted 170 basis points (bps) to 34.8%. Adjusted net income came in at $168.6 million or $1.39 per share compared with $172.4 million or $1.42 per share reported a year ago.Balance Sheet & Cash FlowEquifax exited the reported quarter with $336.4 million in cash and cash equivalents, up from the previous quarter’s balance of $315.4 million. Total long-term debt (excluding current portion) was $1.74 billion, down from $2.04 billion at the end of previous quarter. During the year ended Dec 31, 2017, Equifax generated cash flow of $816 million from operational activities.In 2017, the company paid dividend of $187.4 million. Also, Equifax’s board of directors yesterday approved a quarterly cash dividend of 39 cents to be payable on Mar 30 to shareholders of record date as of Mar 12. Notably, the company has a history of paying quarterly dividend for more than 100 years.OutlookThe company anticipates that the data breach incident will continue impacting its overall results throughout 2018 with having a greater impact during the first half. For the year, Equifax projects revenues in a range of $3.425–$3.525 billion (mid-point: $3.475 billion), representing a year-over-year growth in the range of 2% to 5%.Adjusted EBITDA margin is projected to decline significantly this year. The company expects ongoing costs associated with the free services including the Lock & Alert service as well as expenses related to IT & security will have 30 cents per share negative impact on earnings. Also, higher insurance expenses to cost the company 10 cents per share in 2018.Adjusted EPS for 2018 is projected to come between $5.80 and $6.00 per share. Effective tax rate for the year to remain around 27% as against 31.8% in 2017.For the first quarter of 2018, Equifax anticipates revenues to come between $850 million and $860 million, representing year-over-year growth of 2% to 3%. Expenses related to IT& security as well as legal and professional fees to be approximately $70 million. Adjusted EPS for 2018 is projected to come between $1.34 and $1.39 per share.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates. There have been three revisions higher for the current quarter compared to four lower.Equifax, Inc. Price and Consensus  Equifax, Inc. Price and Consensus | Equifax, Inc.

175,EFX,"A prudent investment decision involves buying stocks that have solid prospects and selling those that carry risks. At times, it is rational to hold certain stocks that have enough potential but are weighed down by tough market conditions. Here we discuss about Proofpoint Inc. (PFPT  -  Free Report), a stock with expected long-term earnings per share growth rate of 23.3% and Growth Score of A.In the last year, Proofpoint has outperformed the Zacks Computer Software-Service industry. The stock has returned approximately 55% in the said period, outperforming the industry’s gain of 26.9%.We believe the stock has the potential to exceed expectations next year as well. The reasons behind our optimism include a healthy cyber-security market, benefits from increasing migration to Microsoft’s (MSFT  -  Free Report) Office 365 as well as acquisitions.Let’s discuss them one by one.Healthy Cybersecurity MarketWe believe Proofpoint will continue to benefit from the increasing demand for cyber-security solutions, given the recent rise in cyber-attacks. These include two massive ransomware attacks — WannaCrypt or WannaCry in May 2017 and Petya in June 2017 — and one major data breach at Equifax (EFX  -  Free Report) reported in September 2017.Most recently, Expedia (EXPE  -  Free Report) reported a data breach where hackers stole customers’ information of 880K payment cards used on its consumer platform as well as its partner’s platform where Orbitz is used as a booking engine.All these have spurred demand for security-related products among enterprises and governments across the world. Per a latest research report from Gartner (IT), worldwide cybersecurity spending is likely to reach $96 billion in 2018 — marking 8% growth from the 2017 level of $89 billion. Another report from Markets and Markets suggests that the cyber security market is expected to witness CAGR of 11% in the 2017-2022 period.We believe the demand for cyber-security solutions bodes well for Proofpoint as it will bring in new customers, thereby boosting its top-line performance.Increased Migration to Office 365As more and more enterprises are migrating to cloud, demand for better cyber-security measures has been on the rise. In the last few quarters, Proofpoint has been witnessing strong demand for its cyber-security suites from enterprises transitioning to cloud, particularly to Office 365.Per the company, customers are looking for additional security capabilities that “complement and enhance the baseline solutions provided by Microsoft.” During 2017, a number of enterprises, which migrated to Office 365, bought the company’s security suit including a significant number of Fortune 500 enterprises.We expect this bullish momentum to continue through 2018 as well, thereby boosting Proofpoint’s Protection and Advanced Threat segment’s top-line performance.Acquisitions to Drive RevenuesProofpoint has made strategic acquisitions to expedite growth. In February 2018, the company signed a definitive agreement to buy Wombat Security Technologies, Inc. In 2017, the company made two important buyouts, Cloudmark, specializing in providing security protection for messaging services, and Weblife.io, a leader in browser isolation solutions. In 2016, the company acquired two businesses — FireLayers and the Email Fraud Protection (EFP) business unit from Return Path.The aforementioned buyouts have not only expanded Proofpoint’s product portfolio but also its customer and revenue base. We believe the company will continue with its strategy of growing through acquisitions, which will help to support its revenues.Bottom LineThe aforementioned factors have positively impacted Proofpoint’s financial performance. Notably, the stock has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters with an average positive surprise of 35.3%. We believe the upbeat performance will continue in the quarters ahead, giving investors reasons to remain optimistic on the stock.Currently, Proofpoint has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

176,EFX,"Shares of Equifax Inc. (EFX  -  Free Report) continue to hit new lows amid mounting scrutiny pressure from lawmakers, investigating agencies and regulators over the credit reporting company’s response to the data breach. The stock tumbled again yesterday due to a series of events which occurred during the entire day.Recent Additions in TroubleIntensifying troubles for Equifax, a group of 37 U.S. Senators, yesterday, vowed for investigation by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Department of Justice. They argued that there is possibly a higher chance of a potential insider trading, as three Equifax’s executives had sold shares in three days after the company discovered the data breach.Meanwhile, the state of Massachusetts announced yesterday that it is planning to file a lawsuit against the company on behalf of its residents. If the state goes ahead with its plan, then it will be no surprise if other states follow suit.Furthermore, a U.S. house panel is probing the data breach and announced that it would testify Equifax’s chief executive — Richard Smith — on Oct 3.Shares of Equifax plunged nearly 15% yesterday after the aforementioned news surfaced. It should be noted that the stock has lost over 30% of its value from last Thursday’s closing price. In the year-to-date period, Equifax has lost 16.3%, significantly underperforming the industry to which it belongs to, which has recorded growth of 27.3%.What’s Bothering Investors?On Sep 7, Equifax announced that highly sensitive personal data of approximately 143 million consumers has been stolen from its database. Reportedly, nearly two-third of the adult U.S. population has been impacted due to this cyber attack.Per the company, the data breach occurred between mid-May and July this year, which was discovered on Jul 29. Apart from some sensitive personal information, hackers have stolen credit card numbers of about 209,000 U.S. consumers and “certain dispute documents with personal identifying information” of nearly 182,000 U.S. consumers.The recent cyber attack has heavily tarnished the brand image, reputation and credibility of Equifax. The company is facing huge customer criticism, while cybersecurity companies are questioning its preparedness and response to this massive data breach. Moreover, with lawmakers and investigating agencies probing the mishap, troubles for Equifax are unlikely to end any time soon.Investors seem concerned that the entire issue may result in loss of customers and the company may also have to make huge compensation to its clients. This is feared to have an adverse impact on the company’s financial performance in the near term.Bottom LineThis is not the first instance when consumer data has been stolen from a company’s data base. Last December, Yahoo! Inc. reported a massive data breach, where private information of over one billion users was compromised. Other big companies like Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report), Anthem Inc. (ANTM  -  Free Report) and Sony Corporation (SNE  -  Free Report) have also been victims of cyber attack, when fraudsters stole large number of consumer data.However, sensitivity of the information exposed in Equifax’s data breach case makes it one of the worst in recent times. The latest data breach at the company will likely have a lasting impact as criminals can use the stolen resources for opening new accounts, applying for credit cards or loans, buying insurance, renting an apartment or even for tax frauds.It should be noted that banks and financial institutions rely on the United States’ three main consumer credit reporting agencies — Equifax, TransUnion (TRU  -  Free Report) and Experian. Therefore, with access to social security, driver’s license and credit card numbers, criminals can make such frauds due to which consumers will have to suffer for longer periods of time.Hence, we believe that investors’ concerns are justified as the mishap will have a lasting impact on Equifax’s results, in the form of financial costs relating to settlement of lawsuits and litigation expenses. Moreover, it will be very tough for the company to repair its brand image, as well as retaining its current customer base.Currently, Equifax carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

177,EFX,"Investors had mixed reactions on Equifax Inc.’s (EFX  -  Free Report) latest quarterly results as depicted from yesterday’s late-hour trade. Following the company’s fourth-quarter 2017 results, the stock rose approximately 2.2% but finally closed after hour trading at less than 0.5%. The share price movement apparently reflects uncertainty and cautiousness among investors pertaining to the last year’s data breach incident. However, the credit bureau company’s revenues and non-GAAP earnings per share came ahead of the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate.In September 2017, Equifax announced that very sensitive personal data of approximately 143 million consumers has been stolen from its database. Thus, analysts and investors waited with bated breath for the credit information provider’s fourth-quarter results, wherein updates on the data breach and its implication on the finances of the company were expected.During the quarter, the company recorded $26.5 million of costs related to the data breach. Notably, in the third quarter it had incurred $87.5 million owing to the same.Despite incurring this huge cybersecurity expense, the company managed to record a year-over-year increase of 40.6% in GAAP earnings per share, courtesy of the latest Tax Cuts and Jobs Act benefit which lowered the effective tax rate. The company recorded a one-time tax benefit of $48.3 million due to the recent tax enactment. On a GAAP basis, Equifax reported earnings of $1.42 per share, up from $1.01 posted in the year-ago quarter.However, on non-GAAP basis (which excludes one-time items including the costs related to data breach and benefit from lower effective tax rate) the company’s non-GAAP earnings came at $1.39 per share, 3 cents lower than the earnings of $1.42 reported in fourth-quarter 2016. Here, it should be noted that the fall would have been much more, but the Securities & Exchange Commission‘s (“SEC”) rule of reporting financial results on non-GAAP basis gave it a scope to somewhat mitigate the debacle. Equifax’s non-GAAP earnings came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.35.Diverse opinion among investors following the company’s fourth-quarter results might have led to the volatility in yesterday’s late-hour trade. Furthermore, investors focus will be on the company’s fourth-quarter earnings conference call, which is scheduled to be held today before the market opens, for a better understanding of its growth prospects.Notably, the stock is on a downtrend since it reported the data-breach incident on Sep 8. It has lost 13.1% of its value since then, while the industry to which it belongs to has gained 19.1%.  Let’s discuss quarterly results in detail.RevenuesEquifax’s revenues of $838.5 million surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $825 million marking a year-over-year improvement of 4.7%. However, it should be noted that this was the second slowest growth rate in the last several quarters after the 3.8% it registered in third-quarter 2017.Lackluster top-line performance was mainly due to the dismal performance at its U.S. Information Solutions (USIS) division which suffered a year-over-year 1% decline in revenues to $313 million, highlighting the impact of the data-breach scandal.

Therefore, we will have to wait for the company’s today’s conference call to have a clearer picture about its future prospects.Escalating expenses related to the cyber attack will remain a drag on the company’s profitability. We expect the company to incur more expenses in the form of legal and professional services associated with the data-breach incident. Further, its expenses might flare up due to increased investments in IT and security solutions as well as insurance services.The brand image and creditability of Equifax has been in question and is facing huge customer criticism, while cybersecurity companies are questioning its preparedness and response to the massive data breach.

178,EFX,"Equifax Inc. (EFX  -  Free Report) is expected to report fourth-quarter 2017 results this week. The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether this credit information providing company will be able to post a positive earnings surprise in the to-be-reported quarter.Last quarter, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 2.7%. Notably, Equifax outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters with an average positive earnings surprise of 2.4%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderWe believe last year’s data breach will continue to hurt Equifax’s fourth quarter’s financial results. Notably, in September 2017, the company announced that very sensitive personal data of approximately 143 million consumers has been stolen from its database.Since then, the brand image and creditability of Equifax has been in question and has been facing huge customer criticism, while cybersecurity companies are questioning the company’s preparedness and response to the massive data breach. Moreover, with lawmakers and investigating agencies probing the mishap, its troubles are unlikely to end any time soon.We believe the entire issue might result in loss of customers and the company will also have to make huge compensation to its clients. This will have an adverse impact on the company’s financial performance in the near term.It should be noted that in third-quarter 2017 the company had witnessed the slowest revenue growth rate in the last several years. This was mainly due to the dismal performance at its U.S. Information Solutions (USIS) division which registered a year-over-year 3% decline in revenues to $307.7 million, reflecting massive impact due to the data-breach scandal.Furthermore, escalating expenses related to the cyber attack will remain a drag on the company’s profitability. Per its 10-Q filing, the company expects to incur more expenses in the form of legal and professional services associated with the data-breach incident. Furthermore, it had stated that its expenses might flare up due to increased investments in IT and security solutions as well as insurance services.Equifax, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Equifax, Inc.

179,EFX,"Proofpoint, Inc. (PFPT  -  Free Report) is slated to release fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 6. The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether this cybersecurity firm will be able to post a positive earnings surprise in the to-be-reported quarter. Notably, the company has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 35.4%. So, let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.What to Expect?The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at 21 cents, representing year-over-year growth of 16.7%. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the past 60 days. Additionally, analysts polled by Zacks project revenues of roughly $139.8 million, up 30.9% from the year-ago quarter.Let’s take a look at the driving factors this quarter.Increased Migration to Office 365 Driving Security DemandAs more and more enterprises are migrating to cloud, demand for better cyber-security measures is on the rise. For the last few quarters, Proofpoint has been witnessing solid demand for its cyber-security suites from enterprises which are transitioning to cloud, particularly to Microsoft's (MSFT  -  Free Report) Office 365.Per the company, customers are looking for additional security capabilities that “complement and enhance the baseline solutions provided by Microsoft.” During the third quarter, a number of enterprises, which migrated to Office 365, bought the company’s security suits that also included a significant number of Fortune 500 enterprises.We expect this momentum to continue in the to-be-reported quarter as well, thereby boosting its Protection and Advanced Threat segment’s top-line performance. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues for the segment is pegged at $105 million, which signifies a year-over-year increase of 3.6.4%.Proofpoint, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Proofpoint, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Proofpoint, Inc. QuoteHealthy Cybersecurity MarketWe believe Proofpoint will continue to benefit from the increasing demand for cyber-security solutions, thanks to a number of cyber attacks that hit the globe last year. It should be noted that in 2017, the world witnessed two back-to-back ransomware attacks, WannaCrypt or WannaCry in May, Petya in June, followed by the massive data breach at Equifax (EFX  -  Free Report) which was reported in September last year.All these have increased the demand for security-related products among enterprises and governments. Per a latest research report from Gartner (IT  -  Free Report), worldwide cybersecurity spending is likely to witness year-over-year growth of 8% this year and reach $96.3 billion.We believe the upswing in the overall cyber-security market bodes well for Proofpoint as it will bring in new customers, thereby boosting its top-line performance.High Renewal RatesThe company maintains a high renewal rate of more than 90% which signifies that it has a better product portfolio and stickier customers. A high renewal rate indicates more predictable revenues and a lesser selling cost.Rising Costs to Dent ProfitabilityProofpoint has recorded remarkable top-line growth in the past quarters on the back of healthy product demand, continued focus on launching products and acquisitions. However, the company’s escalating operating expenses remain an overhang on its bottom-line results.It should be noted that Proofpoint has invested heavily to enhance its sales and marketing capabilities, particularly by expanding the company’s sales force to survive in the highly competitive cyber security market. Notably, the company’s expenses escalated approximately three-fold to $461 million in 2016 from $124 million in 2012. This has affected Proofpoint’s bottom-line performance.We expect increasing operating expense to partly mitigate the benefit of higher revenue growth in the to-be-reported quarter.Currently, Proofpoint carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

180,EFX,"As the eventful 2017 comes to a close, we believe this is the right time to make your investment plans for the upcoming year.A prudent investment decision involves buying stocks which have solid prospects and selling the ones that carry risks. At times it is rational to hold certain stocks that have enough potential but are weighed down by tough market conditions.Here we have discussed the performance of Proofpoint Inc. (PFPT  -  Free Report), a stock with expected long-term earnings per share growth rate of 23.3% and Growth Style Score of A. Notably, it has returned approximately 27.5% this year, outperforming the industry’s gain of 23.1%, to which it belongs to.We believe the stock has the potential to exceed expectations in the next year as well. The reasons behind our optimism include a healthy cyber-security market, benefits from increasing migration to Microsoft’s (MSFT  -  Free Report) Office 365 as well as acquisitions.Let’s discuss them one by one.Healthy Cybersecurity MarketWe believe Proofpoint will continue to benefit from the increasing demand for cyber-security solutions, thanks to a number of cyber attacks which plagued the globe in 2017, including the two massive ransomware attacks — WannaCrypt or WannaCry in May and Petya in June — and one major data breach at Equifax (EFX  -  Free Report) which was reported in September.All these have spurred the demand for security-related products among enterprises and governments across the world. Per a latest research report from Gartner (IT  -  Free Report), worldwide cybersecurity spending is likely reach $96.3 billion in 2018 — marking 8% growth from the 2017 expected level of $89 billion. Another market research firm, Markets and Markets, in its July 2017 report, stated that worldwide cybersecurity spending will likely reach $137.85 billion in 2017 and $231.94 billion by 2022.We believe the upswing in the overall cyber-security market bodes well for Proofpoint as it will bring in new customers, thereby boosting its top-line performance.Increased Migration to Office 365As more and more enterprises are migrating to cloud, demand for better cyber-security measures has been on the rise. For the last few quarters, Proofpoint has been witnessing strong demand for its cyber-security suites from enterprises which are transitioning to cloud, particularly to Office 365.Per the company, customers are looking for additional security capabilities that “complement and enhance the baseline solutions provided by Microsoft.” During the first three quarters of 2017, a number of enterprises, which migrated to Office 365, bought the company’s security suits that also included a significant number of Fortune 500 enterprises.We expect this bullish momentum to continue into 2018 as well, thereby boosting Proofpoint’s Protection and Advanced Threat segment’s top-line performance.Acquisitions to Drive RevenuesProofpoint has made strategic acquisitions to expedite growth. In 2017, the company made two important buyouts, Cloudmark, which is specialized in providing security protection for messaging services, and Weblife.io, a leader in browser isolation solutions. Last year also the company had acquired two businesses — FireLayers and the Email Fraud Protection (EFP) business unit from Return Path.The aforementioned buyouts have not only expanded Proofpoint’s product portfolio but also its customer and revenue base as well. We believe the company will continue with its strategy of growing through acquisitions which will help bolster its revenues.Bottom LineNotably, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has displayed an uptrend in terms of earnings as evident from its average positive earnings surprise of 35.4% in the trailing four quarters.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.We believe the stock still has much potential, which essentially filters the negatives, and focuses on the positives which drive share prices.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

This marked its biggest percentage gain since Apr 24. All of the S&P 500’s 11 sectors ended in the green, led by financials. The Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLF) advanced 1.7%.The financial sector gained from bullish sentiments following weaker than expected impact of Hurricane Irma. The hurricane was initially categorized as a Category 5 hurricane but lost strength after hitting the coast of Florida over the weekend. It has since been degraded to a tropical storm as the impact has been significantly lesser than what had originally been expected by the National Hurricane Centre.Biggest contributors to such gains were stocks of leading insurers..

Early last week, reports surfaced from South Korea that Pyongyang would test another missile over the weekend to celebrate its foundation day. In the event of North Korea not going ahead with the test, geopolitical tensions between Pyongyang and Washington were eased and markets were back to normal.Meanwhile, the United States urged the Security Council of the United Nations to impose fresh sanctions on North Korea. The Trump administration wants the United Nations to impose an oil embargo on Pyongyang. This gave rise to fresh tensions as North Korea reacted by saying that the U.S. would eventually pay a ‘due price’ for backing the imposition of sanctions on the Asian country.Stocks That Made HeadlinesEquifax (EFX  -  Free Report) Tanks as Massive Data Breach News SurfacesThe brand image and creditability of Equifax Inc. (EFX  -  Free Report) is in question as very sensitive personal data of approximately 143 million consumers has been stolen from the credit information provider’s database.

183,EFX,"Hey everybody, Dave Bartosiak here with Trending Stocks at Zacks.com giving you the four dumbest things about the Equifax (EFX  -  Free Report) hack.In case you haven’t heard, hackers breached the data of credit agency Equifax and made off with a few social security numbers and sensitive information. A few…million. Well, 143 million to be exact. So basically nearly half of the US population. That’s right folks, the place that tricks off on you for missing one credit card payment two years ago when you had the stomach flu and sets you up for a 20% loan on your Miata as punishment for your irresponsible behavior, allowed 143 million customer’s data to be hacked. Dumb. Oh, it gets better.Dumb fact number two, the hack wasn’t a one-time event. Hackers exploited a security flaw which was 9 years old, slowly accessing the data over several months. We have attained footage of the hackers cracking the code.The vulnerability was in a popular open-source software package known as Apache Struts. What’s even crazier is that at least 65% of Fortune 100 companies still use web applications built with the Struts framework. Information comprised includes names, Social Security numbers, birth dates, addresses and driver’s license numbers. About 209,000 consumer’s credit card numbers were stolen as well. Boy am I glad Equifax gets to tell potential lenders about how responsible I am with…life.Dumb fact number three, is that three Equifax execs, including the CFO, sold shares in early August. 6,500 shares by the CFO, 4,000 by the president of their US Information Solutions unit, and 1,719 shares by another president. Doesn’t sound like much money, but when you price them at $146, it’s a pretty good chunk of change. The company knew about the hack on July 29th. But, before you give these guys a black eye, they each have a history of selling shares and in the grand scheme of insider compensation, this is a drop in the bucket. All three of these guys still own over 40,000 shares.Dumb fact four, in an attempt to stop the bleeding, Equifax created a website that would allow consumers to check if they were affected by the breach. In the fine print you have to agree to in order to check if you are affected, they snuck in a line saying you would waive your rights to sue Equifax or be part of any class action lawsuit.I suggest everybody out there take a detailed look at your credit report using anyone but Equifax. When you do, dispute any inaccuracies. The bureau has 30 days to respond to your dispute. If they don’t respond within 30 days, the item is dropped from your report. With the flood of disputes Equifax is likely to get now, you may finally be able to resolve some lingering issues like that collection account from your days as an Enzyte customer.Equifax, Inc. Price and Consensus Equifax, Inc. Price and Consensus | Equifax, Inc. QuoteObviously the market didn’t like the breach, sending Equifax shares tumbling since the move. After trading over $142 last week, shares have tumbled down to $113. We’ve still got it as a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) right now as most analysts haven’t jumped out and dropped earnings estimates yet. Those which have commented on the breach believe the stock is oversold. I’d wait until the Congressional hearings to initiate a position for those looking to buy the dip.Every time you share this video, you help somebody with a 580 credit score buy a house with 3 ½ percent down.

184,EFX,"Cybersecurity stocks were seen soaring last Friday, after Equifax Inc. (EFX  -  Free Report) reported a massive data breach. Per the company, highly sensitive personal data of approximately 143 million consumers has been stolen from its database. Reportedly, nearly two-third of the adult U.S. population has been affected due to this cyber attack.The company late last Thursday announced that a data breach occurred between mid-May and July this year, which was discovered on Jul 29. Apart from some sensitive personal information, hackers have stolen credit card numbers of about 209,000 U.S. consumers and “certain dispute documents with personal identifying information” of nearly 182,000 U.S. consumers.This is not the first instance when consumer data has been stolen from a company’s data base. However, sensitivity of the information exposed in Equifax’s data breach case makes it one of the worst in recent times. The latest data breach at the company will likely have a lasting impact as criminals can use the stolen resources for opening new accounts, applying for credit cards or loans, buying insurance, renting an apartment or even for tax frauds.Shares of Equifax plunged nearly 14% last Friday after news of the cyber attack surfaced.Cybersecurity Stocks SoarThe recent cyber attack at Equifax proved that most organizations across the world lack proper security measures.Nonetheless, believe it or not, there is a positive side to this episode.  A cyber attack is good news for cybersecurity companies because it increases the chances of security-related purchases by the companies and governments. Hence, investors flock to these shares, shooting up share prices.Equifax’s Thursday’s announcement gave a sharp boost to cybersecurity stocks, particularly identity protection security providers.Symantec Corporation (SYMC  -  Free Report), which has been enhancing its identity-theft protection capabilities through acquisitions like LifeLock, gained the most with its shares witnessing a 3.4% rise.This was followed by FireEye, Inc. (FEYE  -  Free Report), which is specialized in providing web security, email security, file security and malware analysis. The stock gained 1.5% last Friday.Another cybersecurity company, Proofpoint, Inc. (PFPT  -  Free Report), went up 5.8% during trading hours. But it lost its momentum later to close at just 0.3% higher. The company is one of the leading security-as-a-service providers and focuses on cloud-based solutions for threat protection, compliance, archiving & governance, and secure communications.Computer and Technology Sector 5YR % Return Computer and Technology Sector 5YR % ReturnFresh Boost for Security StocksSo far, the year 2017 has witnessed massive cyber attacks, including the two ransomware attacks — WannaCrypt or WannaCry in May and Petya in June — which created global havoc. However, the silver lining to this entire episode will be the further rise in demand for security-related products among enterprises and governments across the world. This is anticipated to drive share prices to new highs in the rest of 2017.Furthermore, with rapid technological advancement, organizations are increasingly adopting the “bring your own device” (BYOD) policy to enhance employee productivity with anytime/anywhere access. This trend, in turn, calls for stricter data security measures.We believe the urgency for stricter security measures will compel enterprises, as well as governments to increase spending on cyber security software. According to a Markets and Markets report, worldwide cybersecurity spending will likely reach $101 billion in 2018 and $170 billion by 2020.Here we pick three stocks that are expected to benefit from this higher spending. Moreover, these have a favorable combination of a solid Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy), with a Growth Score of A or B. Back-tested results show that this combination can handily beat other stocks.Imperva Inc. (IMPV  -  Free Report) is engaged in the development of protection software and services for business applications and databases. The stock flaunts a Zacks Rank #1 and has a Growth Score of B. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Leidos Holdings, Inc. (LDOS  -  Free Report), along with its subsidiaries, provides technology and engineering services and solutions in the defense, intelligence, civil and health markets. The stock sports a Zacks Rank #1 and has a Growth Score of B.Varonis Systems Inc. (VRNS  -  Free Report) provides an innovative software platform that allows enterprises to map, analyze, manage and migrate unstructured data. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #2 and a Growth Score of B.Bottom LineConsidering the above discussed factors, it makes sense to invest in this hot industry group as cybersecurity players are likely to witness sturdy growth in the near term.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

185,EFX,"Markets suffered losses on Friday after Hurricane Irma gained traction, destroying swathes of the Caribbean and sending insurance stocks lower. Meanwhile, home improvement stocks rose ahead of Irma’s fallout. Investor sentiment was also hurt following reports that North Korea would likely test another nuclear missile over the weekend to celebrate their foundation day. Meanwhile, the House of Representatives passed the Hurricane Harvey relief legislation, extending the debt-ceiling deadline through Dec 8.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) closed at 21,797.79, gaining 0.1%. The S&P 500 Index (INX) decreased 0.2% to close at 2,461.43. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite Index (IXIC) closed at 6,360.19, declining 0.6%. A total of 6 billion shares were traded on Friday, higher than the last 20-session average of 5.8 billion shares. Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1.19-to-1 ratio.  On the Nasdaq, advancers outnumbered decliners by a 1.01-to-1 ratio.  The CBOE VIX increased 1.1% to close at 104.74.North Korea and Hurricane Irma Keep Investors on the EdgeMarkets suffered broad based losses on Friday after Hurricane Irma gained traction. Irma comes just weeks after Hurricane Harvey destroyed the Houston area of Texas. Hurricane Irma destroyed parts of the Caribbean on Thursday and was expected to make a landfall on the coast of Florida over the weekend. This sent insurance stocks lower on Thursday. The hurricane was later degraded to Category 4 on Friday.Insurance stocks did bounce back on Friday afternoon but closed lower for the week. Shares of XL Group (XL  -  Free Report) and RenaissanceRe Holdings (RNR  -  Free Report) declined 5% and 6.4% respectively for the week. On the contrary, home improvement stocks rose ahead of Irma’s fallout. Shares of Home Depot (HD  -  Free Report) and Lowe’s (LOW  -  Free Report) gained 1.1% each on Friday.  Markets also suffered losses on Friday following speculations about North Korea testing another nuclear missile over the weekend which coincides with their foundation day. HD possesses Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) whereas all the other companies possess a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.House of Representatives Pass the Hurricane Aid LegislationEarlier last week, President Trump placed his weight behind Democrats, supporting the extension of the debt ceiling deadline in order to fund a relief program to tackle the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey. The House of Representatives passed the Bill on Friday, extending the debt-ceiling deadline through Dec 8, 2017. The legislation includes $15.25 billion for the relief of victims of Hurricane Harvey. The amount also provides for possible recovery efforts in case of any casualties after Hurricane Irma’s expected landfall over the weekend.On the economic data front, wholesale inventories for the month of July increased 0.6% from the previous period, whereas the consensus estimate was an increase of 0.4%.Weekly UpdateFor the week the Dow, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq declined 0.9%, 0.6% and 1.2% respectively. Reports from South Korea indicated that Pyongyang would test another missile over the weekend to celebrate their foundation day. Such news led investors to rotate out of financial stocks into bonds, leading to broad based losses. President Trump reached an agreement with key members of Congress to extend the debt ceiling deadline. This was done to aid the relief funding for victims of Hurricane Harvey. Meanwhile, Fed’s Vice Chairman announced his plans to retire in mid-October, citing ‘personal reasons’ behind his decision. Meanwhile, the ECB decided unanimously that interest rates would remain unchanged.Stocks That Made HeadlinesEquifax (EFX  -  Free Report) Tanks as Massive Data Breach News SurfacesThe brand image and creditability of Equifax Inc. (EFX  -  Free Report) is in question as very sensitive personal data of approximately 143 million consumers has been stolen from the credit information provider’s database.

186,EFX,"The brand image and creditability of Equifax Inc. (EFX  -  Free Report) is in question as very sensitive personal data of approximately 143 million consumers has been stolen from the credit information provider’s database. Reportedly, nearly two-third of the adult U.S. population has been affected due to this cyber attack.The company late last Thursday announced that a data breach occurred between mid-May and July this year, which was discovered on Jul 29. Per Equifax, criminals stole consumer data like “names, Social Security numbers, birth dates, addresses and, in some instances, driver’s license numbers.”In addition to this, as per Equifax’s investigation, hackers accessed the credit card numbers of about 209,000 U.S. consumers and “certain dispute documents with personal identifying information” of nearly 182,000 U.S. consumers.Shares of Equifax plunged nearly 14% last Friday after news of the cyber attack surfaced. Notably, the stock has significantly underperformed the industry to which it belongs to in the year-to-date period. Equifax has lost 4.2% of its value during this period, while the industry recorded growth of 26.2%.Nonetheless, the financial information services provider further noted that its core consumer or commercial credit reporting databases seemed to be safe as it did not find any unauthorized activity. This implies that the consumers’ credit scores are safe.Among the Worst Data BreachesThis is not the first instance when consumer data has been stolen from a company’s data base. Last December, Yahoo! Inc. reported a massive data breach, where private information of over one billion users was compromised. Other big companies like Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report), Anthem Inc. (ANTM  -  Free Report) and Sony Corporation (SNE  -  Free Report) have also been victims of cyber attack, when fraudsters stole large number of consumer data.However, sensitivity of the information exposed in Equifax’s data breach case makes it one of the worst in recent times as well as bigger than those at the aforementioned companies. The latest data breach at Equifax is expected to have a lasting impact as criminals can use the stolen resources for opening new accounts, applying for credit cards or loans, buying insurance, renting an apartment or even make tax frauds.It should be noted that banks and financial institutions rely on the United States’ three main consumer credit reporting agencies — Equifax, TransUnion (TRU  -  Free Report) and Experian. Therefore, with access to social security, driver’s license and credit card numbers, criminals can make such frauds due to which consumers will have to suffer for a long time.Criticism MountingThe recent cyber attack has heavily tarnished the brand image, reputation and credibility of Equifax. The company is facing huge customer criticism, while cybersecurity companies are questioning its preparedness and response to this massive data breach.Various investigation agencies, including attorney generals of New York and Illinois, and the U.S. House Financial Services Committee, have already started probing whether the company met its risk management responsibilities or not. Equifax’s directors may be charged for negligence if the investigating agencies discover any loopholes in risk management.Also, per Reuters, two lawsuits have been filed against the company’s negligence over consumer data protection, one at Portland, OR, and one in Atlanta.Bottom LineWith the company facing huge criticism from customers, and lawmakers and investigating agencies probing the mishap, troubles for Equifax are unlikely to end any time soon. We opine that the entire issue may result in loss of customers and the company may also have to make huge compensation to its clients. This is feared to have an adverse impact on the company’s financial performance in the near term.The recent cyber attack proved that most organizations across the globe still lack proper cybersecurity measures. With cyber security becoming a matter of utmost importance, companies should regard it as part of safeguarding strategies and look for more stringent cybersecurity measures to plug the loopholes in the system.Currently, Equifax carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

187,EFX,"By this time Monday, we will have seen how the force and impact of Hurricane Irma will have struck the continental U.S. Current models show Miami to be the most at-risk, though Governor Rick Scott said all Floridians ought to evacuate, regardless which coast they may live on or near. We hope everyone remains safe and that the hurricane does not treat the Florida peninsula as a giant bull’s eye.Crops such as oranges and commodities such as frozen orange juice (recall the sub-plot to the 1980s Eddie Murphy movie “Trading Places”) are predicted to rise in price in the near term, and may continue at higher price points for an extended period of time, depending on the storm’s damage. Currently, frozen orange juice futures are up 5% in this morning’s pre-market (discounting any bad information from Clarence Meeks). Also commodities like cotton and timber are produced in the state of Florida, and we may see spikes in prices here, as well.But a far bigger concern for a far bigger portion of the American populace has struck the news feeds this morning: consumer credit reporting agency Equifax (EFX  -  Free Report) has announced it has suffered a major data breach, affecting as many as 143 million Americans. The compromised information includes such sensitive elements as birthdates, Social Security and driver’s license numbers.According to professionals in the field, there is a very good chance your information is included in the breach; Equifax is one of three major credit report companies, so anyone with a credit report is at risk. By some measures, there may be more than a 50% chance this has happened. It is reported the breach took place between mid-May and July of this year; the breach was discovered in late July, with no reports of intrusion at the company since.Also, more than 200K people have now had their credit card numbers stolen. In terms of how many people may have been affected, this breach pales in comparison to the hack we saw at Yahoo a few years ago, but the sensitivity of the information obtained by the hackers is much more potentially damaging to people’s wealth and credit access.This is not the first time Equifax information has been compromised, and cybersecurity analysts had criticized the company for not doing more to protect its customers following those previous attacks. Even worse, part of Equifax’s business is to backstop information to protect against security breaches. Now that this itself has been breached, this effectively erases the backstop. Scary stuff.For those who want to find out whether their information was included in the attack, Equifax has supplied a website: www.equifaxsecurity2017.com. The company has expressed deep regret, and so have shareholders: EFX stock is currently down 13.5% in this morning’s pre-market.

It is reported the breach took place between mid-May and July of this year; the breach was discovered in late July, with no reports of intrusion at the company since.Also, more than 200K people have now had their credit card numbers stolen. In terms of how many people may have been affected, this breach pales in comparison to the hack we saw at Yahoo a few years ago, but the sensitivity of the information obtained by the hackers is much more potentially damaging to people’s wealth and credit access.This is not the first time Equifax information has been compromised, and cybersecurity analysts had criticized the company for not doing more to protect its customers following those previous attacks. Even worse, part of Equifax’s business is to backstop information to protect against security breaches. Now that this itself has been breached, this effectively erases the backstop. Scary stuff.For those who want to find out whether their information was included in the attack, Equifax has supplied a website: www.equifaxsecurity2017.com. The company has expressed deep regret, and so have shareholders: EFX stock is currently down 13.5% in this morning’s pre-market.Mark VickerySenior EditorQuestions or comments about this article and/or its author?

189,EFX,"Shares of Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) were down nearly 3% in morning trading Thursday as concerns over the company’s plans to spend more cash outweighed its solid earnings results. Nevertheless, the social media stock’s brief retreat from all-time highs might actually present the perfect buying opportunity.Facebook released its third-quarter earnings report after the closing bell Wednesday. The company posted profits of $1.59 per share and revenues of $10.33 billion, beating our respective consensus estimates of $1.29 and $9.88 billion. These figures also represented year-over-year growth of 47.4% and 80.7%, respectively.In addition to strong top and bottom line expansion, Facebook once again reported impressive user growth, with daily active users surging roughly 16% to hit a staggering 1.37 billion (also read: Facebook Posts Q3 Earnings Beat, User Growth Hits 16%).But despite this estimate-crushing growth, investors seem to be concerned with the comments from the company’s polarizing founder and CEO, Mark Zuckerberg.“Our community continues to grow and our business is doing well,” Zuckerberg said. “But none of that matters if our services are used in ways that don't bring people closer together. We're serious about preventing abuse on our platforms. We're investing so much in security that it will impact our profitability. Protecting our community is more important than maximizing our profits.”Recently, Zuckerberg has emerged as the latest villain in the ongoing saga related to Russia’s interference in the U.S. election. As details chronicling the country’s use of Facebook to spread disinformation during the campaign cycle have emerged, Zuckerberg and the rest of his executive team have scrambled to save face and take accountability for the content published on their platform.On top of this, increased public scrutiny over data security, punctuated by the devastating Equifax (EFX  -  Free Report) breach this year, has the entire internet industry rethinking how its protects its users’ private information.For Facebook, it appears the response is to double down on security, and the promise of new spending has investors fleeing this morning. But should they be?In the wake of the company’s earnings announcement, at least 13 brokerages have already raised their price targets on the stock, with a median target of $208 representing a 13.9% premium to Wednesday’s record-high close.“Yes, we take foreign meddling in U.S. elections very seriously. Call it what it is—political warfare. And countering will—and should—raise the cost of doing business for FB. But that business is inherently extremely impressive,” said RBC Capital analyst Mark Mahaney.Mahaney’s firm made the most bullish call on Facebook, raising its price target to $230 from $195. In a similar vein, Susquehanna Financial’s Shyam Patil noted that Facebook has a history of outperforming.“While the initial expense growth outlook for 2018 may have been more aggressive than anticipated, we would note that [Facebook] has a history of underspending guide, and we are currently well below the low end for expense growth in 2018,” Patil wrote in a note.For now, Facebook remains a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). While this ranking could change based on possible estimate revisions in the near future, investors should understand that Zuckerberg’s plans to invest in security do not fundamentally change the remarkable growth story that his company has created.This fiscal year has seen impressive top and bottom line growth, and we expect that to continue into fiscal 2018. In fact, our current consensus estimates are calling for earnings and revenue to swell by 21.8% and 31.1%, respectively, next year.Want more stock market analysis from this author?

Shares have lost about  3.9% in that time frame, outperforming the market.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Equifax Q2 Earnings Top, Revenues Miss, Updates ViewEquifax reported mixed results for second-quarter 2017. The company’s adjusted earnings (excluding amortization expenses, Veda Group acquisition-related charges and other one-time items) per share from continuing operations of $1.60 surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.57 and also jumped 11.9% year over year.On a GAAP basis, the company reported earnings of $1.36 per share, up from the year-ago quarter tally of $1.08 per share. The strong year-over-year bottom-line growth can primarily be attributed to solid top-line performance and stringent cost management, which was partially offset by a marginal increase in the number of total outstanding shares.Details of the QuarterEquifax’s revenues of $856.7 million lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $861 million as well as management’s guided range of $857–$862 million. However, the figure was up 6% on a year-over-year basis.According to Richard F. Smith, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer at Equifax, ""Second quarter performance reflects outstanding execution by the team and the strength of our unique portfolio of businesses.""The company made slight changes in its reportable segments from first-quarter 2016.

Among its sub-segments, growth was recorded in Online Information Solutions (6%), Mortgage Solutions Services (10%) and Financial Marketing Services (15%).International revenues (including Europe, the Asia Pacific, Canada and Latin America) advanced 6% year over year to $231.4 million. On a constant-currency basis, revenues increased 10%. Growth was mainly driven by the Veda Group acquisition, which increased the Asia-Pacific region’s contribution to revenues to $76.5 million, up 6% year over year. Moreover, revenues registered an increase of 13%, 4% and 2% in Latin America, Canada and Europe, respectively.Revenues from the Workforce Solutions segment climbed 10% year over year to $194.5 million, primarily on the back of 19% revenue growth in Verification Services, which more-than offset 5% decline in Employer Services.Global Consumer Solutions contributed $98.9 million to total revenue, reflecting an 8% year-over-year decline. On a constant-currency basis, revenues dropped 7%.Operating ResultsEquifax’s adjusted EBITDA increased approximately 13% to $334.7 million. Consequently, adjusted operating EBITDA margin expanded 250 basis points (bps) to 39.1%. Adjusted net income came in at $194.8 million or $1.60 per share compared with $172.7 million or $1.43 per share reported a year ago.Balance Sheet & Cash FlowEquifax exited the quarter with $403.9 million in cash and cash equivalents, up from the previous quarter’s balance of $123.2 million.

191,EFX,"Equifax Inc. (EFX  -  Free Report) recently completed the acquisition of ID Watchdog in an all-cash deal. The company had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire ID Watchdog on Jun 16, 2017.Per the agreement, Equifax will pay approximately $63 million in cash, which translates to nearly 40 cents per share, to acquire all outstanding shares of ID Watchdog. The buyout is aimed to provide a boost to Equifax’s capabilities to serve customers better.Founded in 2005, ID Watchdog is one of the leading providers of identity theft protection and resolution services to the Employee Benefits marketplace. The acquisition is anticipated to further strengthen Equifax’s identity theft protection services and fortify its presence in the employee benefits space.According to Dann Adams, President of Global Consumer Solutions at Equifax, “""We are excited to have ID Watchdog's industry leading products become an important part of our organization."" Adams further added, ""Merging our Identity solutions and industry relationships will significantly increase the access, range, and depth of our employee benefits solutions.""Equifax is the world’s largest data management company which organizes and assimilates data related to more than 820 million customers, and 91 million businesses globally.The company has made strategic acquisitions to supplement its core business. In 2014, the company acquired TDX Group and Forseva, while it closed the Veda Group Limited buyout in first-quarter 2016.We believe that management’s efforts, such as strategic initiatives for product innovation, expansion of data assets through acquisitions and continuous share gains in North America, should act as tailwinds. Moreover, the company’s strong correlation with the consumer and financial markets, as well as exposure in the U.S. and Europe are likely to propel growth, moving ahead.However, we foresee the company’s investments in new initiatives to weigh on its upcoming quarterly earnings. Additionally, uncertainty surrounding IT spending and the strengthening U.S. dollar remain concerns.Moreover, increasing competition from the likes of Fiserv (FISV  -  Free Report), Automatic Data Processing Inc (ADP  -  Free Report) and Total System Services (TSS  -  Free Report) are other factors likely to affect earnings in the near term.Zacks' 10-Minute Stock-Picking SecretSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.

192,EFX,"Fiserv Inc.’s (FISV  -  Free Report) second-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings from continuing operations of $1.19 per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.23. However, it improved 10.2% from the year-ago quarter.Total revenue increased approximately 1.7% year over year to $1.39 billion but missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.42 billion. Adjusted revenues grew 2.2% year over year to $1.32 billion.Segment-wise, Payments and Industry Products adjusted revenues increased 3.3% year over year to $716 million. Financial Institution Services adjusted revenues were up 1.6% year over year to $623 million.Internal revenues rose 3% owing to 3% growth each in Payments and Financial segments.Source-wise, total Processing and services revenues increased 2.3% on a year-over-year basis to $1.19 billion while Product revenues decreased 2% year over year to $200 million.Lower-than-expected results pulled the company’s shares down about 2.5% in the after-hour trading session. Notably, shares of Fiserv have gained 21.7% year to date, slightly underperforming the industry’s 23.5% rally.MarginsAdjusted operating income increased 2.7% from the year-ago quarter to $424 million. The company’s adjusted operating margin of 32% increased 10 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis.Other Financial DetailsAs of Jun 30, 2017, Fiserv had cash and cash equivalents of $299 million compared with $308 million as on Mar 31, 2017.

Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Fiserv, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Fiserv, Inc. QuoteOur TakeFiserv commands a leading position in the financial and payment solutions business backed by a broad customer base and key contract wins. Additionally, the strong user base of Mobiliti ASP remains a major growth driver. The company remains focused on expanding its product portfolio. Product-oriented acquisitions are leading to a steady flow of customers.Investment in digital-oriented technologies is likely to improve its competitiveness. Fiserv’s digital banking solutions are gaining momentum among the banks and credit unions. The company is also rapidly expanding in the overseas markets.Fiserv expects revenues from base solutions like DNA and Agiliti to drive growth. Its new five-year cost cutting program is also likely to prove beneficial. In the second quarter, Fiserv added six DNA clients, four among which have over $1 billion in assets, and expects to add at least 10 more in 2017. Mobiliti ASP subscribers grew 30% to more than 6 million. The company’s $40 million savings in the first half of the year was driven by workforce optimization, progress in procurement and data center consolidation.However, lower termination fees, EMV deferral and adverse foreign currency translations are negatively impacting the company’s sales. Moreover, increasing regulations in the banking and financial services industry and intensifying competition from the likes of Equifax Inc. (EFX  -  Free Report), and Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (FIS  -  Free Report) remain concerns.Zacks Rank & Stock to Consider Fiserv carries Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

193,EFX,"Proofpoint, Inc. (PFPT  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 19.We believe increased migration to Microsoft’s (MSFT  -  Free Report) Office 365, healthy cybersecurity market and high renewal rates will likely drive the company’s overall third-quarter results.Let’s discuss them one by one.Migration to Office 365As more and more enterprises are migrating to cloud, demand for better cyber-security measures is on the rise. For the last few quarters, Proofpoint has been witnessing strong demand for its cyber-security suites by enterprises which are transitioning to cloud, particularly to Office 365.Per the company, customers are looking for additional security capabilities that “complement and enhance the baseline solutions provided by Microsoft.” During the second quarter, a number of enterprises, which migrated to Office 365, bought the company’s security suits that also included a significant number of Fortune 500 enterprises.We expect the momentum to continue in the to-be-reported quarter as well, thereby boosting its Protection and Advanced Threat segment’s top-line performance. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues for the segment is pegged at $97 million.Healthy Cybersecurity MarketWe believe Proofpoint will continue to benefit from the increasing demand for cyber-security solutions, thanks to a number of cyber attacks across the globe in the last few months. It should be noted that the current year has witnessed massive cyber attacks, so far, including the two ransomware attacks — WannaCrypt or WannaCry in May, Petya in June, and one major data breach at Equifax (EFX  -  Free Report)  which was reported last month.All these have increased the demand for security-related products among enterprises and governments across the world. Per a latest research report from Gartner (IT  -  Free Report), worldwide cybersecurity spending is likely to witness year-over-year growth of 7% this year and reach $86.4 billion.We believe the upswing in the overall cyber-security market bodes well for Proofpoint as it will bring in new customers, thereby boosting its top-line performance.High Renewal RatesThe company maintains a high renewal rate of more than 90% which signifies that it has a better product portfolio and stickier customers. A high renewal rate indicates more predictable revenues and a lesser selling cost.Proofpoint, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Proofpoint, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Proofpoint, Inc. QuoteEscalating Costs to Remain Overhang on ProfitabilityAlthough Proofpoint has witnessed remarkable top-line growth in the past quarters on the back of healthy product demand, sustained focus on launching products and acquisitions, the company has failed to deliver on the bottom line.It should be noted that Proofpoint has invested heavily to enhance its sales and marketing capabilities, particularly by expanding the company’s sales force to survive in the highly competitive cyber security market. Notably, the company’s expenses escalated approximately three-fold to $461 million in 2016 from $124 million in 2012. This affected Proofpoint’s bottom-line performance.Since Proofpoint continues to invest in sales and marketing, we anticipate this to remain a drag on the company’s third-quarter bottom-line results with Consensus Estimate of loss of 23 cents.However, we expect a year-over-year improvement in the bottom-line results, mainly due to higher top-line expectation. In the year-ago quarter, Proofpoint had posted a loss of 27 cents. Furthermore, the third-quarter Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $132 million, representing 32% year-over-year growth.Currently, Proofpoint carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

196,EFX,"Looking for economic data? You’ve come to the right week. Only trouble is, most of it is coming out after the opening bell today and beyond — which means, by definition, after the Ahead of Wall Street column is published. August New Home Sales and September Consumer Confidence reports come out at 10am ET. Also, Fed Chair Janet Yellen speaks this afternoon, as do other Fed players — specifically Lael Brainard, Loretta Mester and Raphael Bostic. After today’s closing bell, we will see fiscal Q1 2018 earnings results from Nike (NKE  -  Free Report).Ahead of today’s start to normal-day trading, the Case-Shiller Home Price Index report came in slightly better than expected: 5.9% versus 5.7% for the month of July. Yes, this data is from the middle of summer, but is considered to be the most accurate of all metrics regarding U.S. home pricing. This is something the Fed should be happy to see — that real estate price growth is higher than analysts were anticipating — because this lends itself to increased inflation, which will help the Fed (finally) see its 2% goal. Even if this takes longer than expected, increased home pricing is better than a decrease.The other side of the Fed’s dual mandate, apart from 2% inflation, is job growth. This has been solid for the past year and even previously. What has puzzled economists is the lack of wage growth, and on this issue, a new report released by The Hamilton Project, headed by a Brookings Institute fellow, indicates we have seen 0.2% wage growth over the past year. This report, which looks at more than four decades’ worth of data, tracks how productivity and wage growth has decoupled.From 1947 through roughly 1977, wage growth and productivity were in-line with one another. By the late 1990s, productivity had zoomed past wage growth. It flattened during the Great Recession in the last decade, and has been up only gradually ever since. But productivity is still far above wage growth in 2017.Companies like Target (TGT  -  Free Report) independently raising its minimum wage — reported on here by Zacks’ Maddy Johnson — should help a bit, but only if all other retailers, restaurants, etc. follow suit. One company is not enough to create wage growth pressure, which is exactly what is needed for that inflation metric to hit the Fed’s goals.As mentioned above, we expect some interesting statements from Fed Chair Yellen and other members of the Federal Reserve today. Perhaps markets will take direction from these statements later today and for the rest of the week.Equifax (EFX  -  Free Report) CEO Richard Smith is stepping down from his post effective today, a couple weeks after news that 143 million Americans’ data has been compromised by a breach at the company. The stock has fallen precipitously since this news report, and looks to open lower again today.Finally, Carnival Cruise Lines (CCL  -  Free Report) has beaten earnings estimates for at least the fifth consecutive quarter, topping fiscal Q3 2017 estimates by 9 cents per share and coming out ahead of revenue estimates as well. The company did report it expects hurricane and damages in the Caribbean to have a negative effect on Q4 results, but shares are trading up in today’s pre-market.

197,EFX,"Equifax Inc. (EFX  -  Free Report) yesterday announced that it has joined forces with Oplogic, a provider of CRM solutions for automotive dealerships, to reduce synthetic ID fraud. This type of fraud involves creation of a new identity by combining real (usually stolen) and fake information.Helping Auto Dealers Detect FraudDealerships can scan a potential buyer’s driving license using Oplogic CRM software. During the scan, license verification occurs against Equifax data and fraud tools.Ken Allen, SVP of Identity and Fraud at Equifax, stated that with the increase in complexity of fraudulent activities over the years, the company’s data analytics platforms have also become sophisticated. According to Allen, Equifax is making great strides in countering synthetic ID fraud by partnering with the likes of Oplogic.Attempt to Boost USIS RevenuesWe believe that the latest move will help Equifax generate more revenues from identity and fraud solutions. These solutions are included in the company’s Online Information Solutions, which forms a part of its USIS segment.In the first quarter of 2018, Online Information Solutions’ revenue of $219.7 million declined 2% year over year. Total USIS revenues of $306.9 million were down 1% year over year.Equifax, Inc. Revenue (TTM) Equifax, Inc. Revenue (TTM) | Equifax, Inc. QuoteShare Price MovementWe observe that shares of Equifax have declined 10.2% in the past year against the industry's rally of 40.8%. The cyber-attack at Equifax, wherein criminals stole highly sensitive personal data of approximately 143 million consumers, has severely tarnished the brand image, reputation and credibility of the company.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderEquifax has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked stocks in the broader Business Services sector include The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation (DNB  -  Free Report), FLEETCOR Technologies, Inc. (FLT  -  Free Report) and WEX Inc. (WEX  -  Free Report). While Dun & Bradstreet and WEX sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), FLEETCOR carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

198,EFX,"Equifax Inc. (EFX  -  Free Report) yesterday announced the launch of an instant alert — The Work Number Indicator — that will notify the existence of any individual’s employment and income record in The Work Number database. The Work Number database — a product of Equifax Verification Services — is one of the nation’s largest sources of authentic employment and income information with a current database of more than 5,500 employers from all over the United States.This is an initiative taken up by Equifax to aid the mortgage industry which is trying to adapt to consumer preferences and get more digitalized to strengthen its position.The Work Number Indicator, which comes with a credit report, provides lenders access to the current employment and income status of their borrowers, in order to help them analyze the latter’s payback ability. This not only saves time by avoiding the elaborate documentation process involved in granting a loan but also increases work efficiency, thereby making customer dealings easier than before. The indicator maintains a record of any changes in employment on any customer or client portfolio.Notably, Equifax’s The Work Number seems to have gained popularity in the market. On Apr 10, 2018, AmeriSave Mortgage Corporation reported a 15% improvement in mortgage origination efficiency by utilizing The Work Number report for verification of employment and income (VOE/VOI). On Jan 27, 2017, Equifax and Fiserv, Inc. (FISV) had collaborated to ease out the loan approval process by linking Equifax’s The Work Number with Fiserv's Automotive Loan Origination System.Bottom Line The offering is expected to complement Equifax’s growing Verification Services, thereby boosting its Workforce Solutions segment. The Workforce Solutions segment accounts for nearly 22-23% of Equifax’s total yearly revenues.In 2017, Verification Services contributed the largest chunk (around 66%) to Workforce Solutions revenues. Verification Services revenues increased almost 38% from $364.4 million in 2015 to $501.5 million in 2017. Additionally, in first-quarter 2018, the service reported 12% growth from the year-ago quarter due to robust government, financial, mortgage, and pre-employment activities along with continuous addition of new records to The Work Number database.Zacks Rank & Price PerformanceCurrently, Equifax has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. We observe that shares of Equifax have returned 0.6% but underperformed the industry’s gain of 19.2% in the past six months.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the broader Business Services sector include Verifone Systems, Inc. (PAY  -  Free Report), FLEETCOR Technologies, Inc. (FLT  -  Free Report) and WEX Inc. (WEX  -  Free Report). While Verifone and FLEETCOR Technologies currently carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), WEX sports a Zacks Rank #1.The long-term expected earnings per share growth rate for Verifone, FLEETCOR Technologies and WEX is 14.9%, 16.5% and 14.3%, respectively.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

199,EFX,"The financial services industry has transformed significantly in recent years, considering the notable changes in transaction techniques. Technology plays a major role, with digitalization taking center stage.In today’s fast-paced life, people rely heavily on digital technologies and gadgets – especially mobile, laptops and others – for day to day needs. Digitalization of banking and payment services has made it easier for them to conduct transactions.Companies in this industry are expanding their business and enhancing their product portfolio with the introduction of advanced products and services, and strategic acquisitions and partnerships.However, the industry is getting competitive with the entry of several non-banking bodies such as global and local IT product and services companies, payment service providers and processors – who are offering both customer facing and back office financial technology products and services. Going forward, competition is anticipated to increase as market entrants multiply in number and the existing ones expand their product lines and services.Given this backdrop, it is not a bad idea to undertake a comparative analysis of two Financial Transaction Services stock — Fiserv, Inc. (FISV  -  Free Report) and Equifax Inc. (EFX  -  Free Report). Both the stocks are part of the broader Business Services sector (one of the 16 Zacks sectors). While Fiserv has a market capitalization of $29.79 billion, Equifax’s market cap is $13.77 billion.Currently, both the stocks carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Price PerformanceFiserv clearly scores over Equifax in terms of price performance. Fiserv has gained 15.5% in a year’s time, outperforming the S&P 500’s rally of 11.5%. Equifax has declined 17.2%, underperforming the S&P 500. Earnings ExpectationsEarnings growth along with stock price gains is often an indication of a company’s strong prospects.Fiserv’s current-quarter earnings are projected to grow 23.3% while that of Equifax are expected to decline 3.7%.  Looking at the full-year 2018 picture, Fiserv’s earnings are projected to grow 21.9% while that of Equifax are expected to decrease 0.5%. For 2019, Fiserv’s earnings are expected to register 12.6% growth compared with 8.6% for Equifax. Moreover, the long-term expected earnings per share growth rate of 11.5% for Fiserv is higher than Equifax’s growth rate of 7.9%.Thus, Fiserv has an edge over Equifax in terms of quarterly and yearly projected earnings growth.Earnings Surprise HistoryThe earnings surprise history of a stock gives investors an idea of the stock’s performance in the previous quarters.Equifax has performed better than Fiserv, having surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the previous four quarters, delivering an average beat of 2.9%. Fiserv has delivered positive surprise in two of the prior four quarters with an average beat of 0.4%.Valuation Price to Earnings Ratio (P/E) metric is used to measure a company's value relative to its earnings. In general, a lower number or multiple is usually considered better than a higher one.The trailing 12-month price-to-earnings multiple for Fiserv and Equifax is 26.9 and 19.2, respectively, while that of the industry is 29.1. Although both the companies are undervalued relative to the industry, Equifax has an edge with a lower P/E ratio.The EV/EBITDA metric is used to compare two stocks within the same industry and offers a clearer picture of a company’s valuation because it includes debt. The ratio is often used in addition to the P/E ratio.We observe that while Fiserv and Equifax have EV/EBITDA ratios of 16.9 and 12.4, respectively, the industry’s figure stands at 16.3. Equifax has an edge with a lower EV/EBITDA ratio and is undervalued relative to the industry. Fiserv is overvalued relative to the industry.ROE and ROCReturn on Equity (ROE) is the measure of a company’s efficiency in utilizing shareholders’ funds. Fiserv’s ROE for the trailing 12 months looks impressive in comparison to Equifax. The current ROE for Fiserv is 44.1% compared with 38.4% for the industry. Equifax’s ROE stands at 22.6%. Return on Capital (ROC) for Fiserv and Equifax is 15.6% and 14.2%, respectively. While both the stocks have scored below the industry level of 20.6%, Fiserv scores over Equifax in this respect.Bottom LineOur comparative analysis shows that Fiserv scores over Equifax in terms of price performance, expected earnings growth, return on capital and equity. However, Equifax enjoys an advantage in terms of valuation.So, even though Fiserv seems expensive compared to Equifax, it is likely to generate higher capital appreciation.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the broader Business Services sector include Verifone Systems, Inc. (PAY  -  Free Report) and WEX Inc. (WEX  -  Free Report). Both the stocks carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).   The long-term expected earnings per share growth rates for Verifone and WEX are 14.9% and 14.3%, respectively.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions. Apple sold a mere 1 billion iPhones in 10 years but a new breakthrough is expected to generate more than 27 billion devices in just 3 years, creating a $1.7 trillion market. Zacks has just released a Special Report that spotlights this fast-emerging phenomenon and 6 tickers for taking advantage of it.

200,EFX,"Tuesday, September 26, 2017Looking for economic data? You’ve come to the right week. Only trouble is, most of it is coming out after the opening bell today and beyond — which means, by definition, after the Ahead of Wall Street column is published. August New Home Sales and September Consumer Confidence reports come out at 10am ET. Also, Fed Chair Janet Yellen speaks this afternoon, as do other Fed players — specifically Lael Brainard, Loretta Mester and Raphael Bostic. After today’s closing bell, we will see fiscal Q1 2018 earnings results from Nike (NKE  -  Free Report).Ahead of today’s start to normal-day trading, the Case-Shiller Home Price Index report came in slightly better than expected: 5.9% versus 5.7% for the month of July. Yes, this data is from the middle of summer, but is considered to be the most accurate of all metrics regarding U.S. home pricing. This is something the Fed should be happy to see — that real estate price growth is higher than analysts were anticipating — because this lends itself to increased inflation, which will help the Fed (finally) see its 2% goal. Even if this takes longer than expected, increased home pricing is better than a decrease.The other side of the Fed’s dual mandate, apart from 2% inflation, is job growth. This has been solid for the past year and even previously. What has puzzled economists is the lack of wage growth, and on this issue, a new report released by The Hamilton Project, headed by a Brookings Institute fellow, indicates we have seen 0.2% wage growth over the past year. This report, which looks at more than four decades’ worth of data, tracks how productivity and wage growth has decoupled.From 1947 through roughly 1977, wage growth and productivity were in-line with one another. By the late 1990s, productivity had zoomed past wage growth. It flattened during the Great Recession in the last decade, and has been up only gradually ever since.

One company is not enough to create wage growth pressure, which is exactly what is needed for that inflation metric to hit the Fed’s goals.As mentioned above, we expect some interesting statements from Fed Chair Yellen and other members of the Federal Reserve today. Perhaps markets will take direction from these statements later today and for the rest of the week.Equifax (EFX  -  Free Report) CEO Richard Smith is stepping down from his post effective today, a couple weeks after news that 143 million Americans’ data has been compromised by a breach at the company. The stock has fallen precipitously since this news report, and looks to open lower again today.Finally, Carnival Cruise Lines (CCL  -  Free Report) has beaten earnings estimates for at least the fifth consecutive quarter, topping fiscal Q3 2017 estimates by 9 cents per share and coming out ahead of revenue estimates as well.

201,EFX,"The Cybersecurity industry has been on a bullish trend, of late, thanks to the series of cyber attacks over the last few months. Among these, the recently reported cyber attack at Equifax Inc. (EFX  -  Free Report) is believed to be the most malicious, in which very sensitive personal data of approximately 143 million consumers was stolen from the company’s database.Reportedly, nearly two-third of the adult U.S. population has been adversely affected due to this cyber attack. The data breach at the company is likely to have a lasting impact as criminals can use the stolen resources for opening new accounts, applying for credit cards or loans, buying insurance, renting an apartment or even make tax frauds.While the world was still recuperating from this shocking attack, another massive cyber crime hit headlines last Monday (Sep 18), when Avast reported that its CCleaner security software has been infected with a malware, exposing over 2 million users. The sensitivity of this attack can be understood with the fact that the criminals tried to infect machines of technology and telecoms companies, including biggies like Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) and Intel (INTC  -  Free Report), per a report by Cisco Systems.Fresh Boost for Security StocksBased on the aforementioned back-to-back cyber crimes, cybersecurity stocks are on a roll now. ETFMG Prime Cyber Security ETF (HACK  -  Free Report) has gained 2.3% in a month’s time. In 2017, so far, the ETF has returned 12.8%, outperforming the S&P 500 (GSPC) gain of 11.4%.Apart from the above discussed attacks, the bullish momentum is well supported by the two back-to-back ransomware attacks — WannaCry or WannaCrypt in May and Petya in June — which created global havoc. In both cases, the malicious software reportedly seized control of computers and encrypted files with a password which only hackers have access to. After this, victims were asked to pay ransom in order to regain control of the systems. The hackers demanded ransom in bitcoin.Investors Should Bank on this OpportunityThough billions of dollars and data are lost due to cyber crime, there is a positive side to it. Cybersecurity companies stand to gain from data breaches as the chances of security-related purchase shoot up.Furthermore, with rapid technological advancement, organizations are increasingly adopting the bring your own device (BYOD) policy to enhance employee productivity, with anytime/anywhere access. This trend, in turn, calls for stricter data security measures.We believe the urgency for stricter security measures will compel enterprises, as well as governments to increase spending on cyber security software. According to a Markets and Markets July 2017 report, worldwide cybersecurity spending will likely reach $137.85 billion this year and $231.94 billion by 2022.Here we focus on three stocks that are anticipated to benefit from this elevated spending.FireEye Inc. (FEYE  -  Free Report) is a specialized provider of a security platform against cyber-attacks to enterprises and governments. The company’s consistent efforts toward bringing in new and advanced products have been attracting a wide range of customers. Notably, FireEye’s Essentials product, which is a lower-cost and simpler version of the FireEye Global Threat Management platform, targets smaller and mid-market companies. This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company’s Cloud MVX and MVX Smart Grid offerings, a lower-cost intelligent threat detection solution, targets large enterprises as well as mid-market businesses. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Furthermore, the company’s move of shifting its business model to subscription-based cloud services from selling software is praiseworthy. Though shifting the business model to subscription-based services will generate lower revenues initially, but the same will be stable over the long run, as organizations usually renew subscriptions with the existing products or even with higher versions. Moreover, subscription-based services generate higher gross margins.Additionally, last year’s acquisition of iSIGHT Partners strengthened the company’s capabilities by offering an intelligence-led security model for enterprises of any size that other security providers finds difficult to match. FireEye has also taken over Invotas, a firm specializing in improving response times following a cyber-attack. Its product, Security Orchestrator, is designed to compile information from a range of security products and automate responses when an incident occurs.Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (PANW  -  Free Report) allows firms, service providers and government bodies to impose tighter security measures through its network security platform. The company is growing rapidly on the back of its innovative next-generation security platforms. Its security platforms have innovative traffic classification engine that helps it identify network traffic by application, user and content. Palo Alto’s security platforms simplify security infrastructure for organizations by eliminating the need for multiple, stand-alone security appliances, and software products. This reduces the total cost of ownership, thereby giving the organization a competitive edge.Also, we believe its strategic acquisitions with the likes of LightCyber, Morta Security and Cyvera will continue to bolster revenues. These acquisitions helped this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company expand the functionality of its enterprise security platform, in turn bringing in more and more customers.Additionally, Palo Alto has made strategic partnerships with the likes of VMware and Aruba Networks to expedite growth. These strategic partnerships bring in customers for Palo Alto, thus boosting its top line.Check Point Software Technologies Ltd. (CHKP  -  Free Report) has evolved into a well-known provider of information technology (IT) security solutions across the world. The heightening security threats and potential hacking attacks led the company to turn to Software Blade architecture in 2009 from an appliance-led model. The company’s blade architecture is becoming increasingly popular as it enables customers to choose from an archive of software blades and customize the solution to suit the user’s requirements.Rapid adoption of Check Point’s data center appliances and consistent enhancements in data center product lines are likely to provide ample top-line support. The company’s focus on boosting mobile capabilities will enable it to tap brighter prospects.Bottom LineConsidering the above discussed factors, it makes sense to invest in this hot industry group as cybersecurity players are likely to witness sturdy growth in the near term.Can Hackers Put Money INTO Your Portfolio?Earlier this month, credit bureau Equifax announced a massive data breach affecting 2 out of every 3 Americans. The cybersecurity industry is expanding quickly in response to this and similar events. But some stocks are better investments than others.Zacks has just released Cybersecurity!

202,EFX,"The cyber-security industry has been putting up an impressive show on the bourse, of late, with the slew of cyber attacks, over the past few months, playing the supporting role. Cisco’s (CSCO  -  Free Report) latest report hints at another attack hovering over Ukraine, once again, which might cause a complete blackout in the country.Per the findings of Talos — a cyber-intelligence unit of Cisco — hackers have infected more than 500,000 routers and storage devices across 54 nations. It is feared that this sophisticated malware, VPNFilter, has infected the devices of Linksys, MikroTik, Netgear (NTGR  -  Free Report), TP-Link and QNAP.The sensitivity of this cyber attack can be understood with the fact that the malware codes discovered in the infected devices were similar to the ones used earlier to attack Ukraine.  In 2015 and 2016, cybercriminals had wrongfully accessed and paralyzed the country’s power utility networks, causing nationwide blackouts and factory shutdowns. Therefore, Cisco is suspecting another similar blackout, this time too, ahead of Ukraine’s Constitution Day on June 28.While the jitters sent across the globe by Cisco’s latest report had yet not dissipated, another massive cybercrime report hit headlines on May 28. This Monday, two of the largest Canadian banks reported fraudsters gaining access to the personal and financial information of almost 90K of their customers.Fresh Boost for Security StocksNevertheless, cyberattacks do not spell bad news for all companies. Particularly, cyber-security stocks have been on a roll since the second half of 2017, thanks to the plaguing attacks which created havoc across the globe last year.Some of the most notable ones included the two back-to-back ransomware attacks — WannaCry or WannaCrypt in May and Petya in June — followed by the massive data breach at Equifax (EFX  -  Free Report) in September. In addition to these, the data theft and ransom paid by Uber disclosed in November further fueled the bullish momentum of the stocks in this space.In 2018, so far, the ETFMG Prime Cyber Security ETF (HACK) has returned 19%, outperforming the Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLK) and S&P 500’s gains of 9.3% and 0.4%, respectively. The Cyber Security ETF has gained 4.3% in a month’s time. Computer and Technology Sector 5YR % Return Computer and Technology Sector 5YR % Return Encouragingly, the latest cyber attacks will spur demand for security-related products among companies and governments, thereby boosting top and bottom lines of cyber-security providers. We believe this would further drive the share prices of cyber-security stocks.Investors Should Bank on This OpportunityThough billions of dollars and data are lost due to cyber crime, there is a positive side to it. Cyber-security companies stand to gain from data breaches as the chances of security-related purchases shoot up.Furthermore, with rapid technological advancement, organizations are increasingly adopting the Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) policy to enhance employee productivity, with anytime/anywhere access. This trend, in turn, calls for stricter data security measures.We believe the urgency for stricter security measures will compel enterprises, as well as governments to increase spending on cyber-security software. Per the latest report by Gartner, global enterprise security spending will reach $96.3 billion in 2018 — marking 8% growth from the 2017 expected level of $89 billion.Another market research firm, Markets and Markets, in its July 2017 report, stated that worldwide cyber-security spending will likely reach $231.94 billion by 2022.Here, we focus on three stocks that are anticipated to benefit from this elevated spending.FireEye Inc.

Over the past few quarters, the company has been witnessing strong demand for its cyber-security suites from enterprises transitioning to cloud, particularly to Office 365.Additionally, Proofpoint has made strategic acquisitions to expedite growth.
