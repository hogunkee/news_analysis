7,TSCO,"With a year-to-date return of over 29.34%, Columbia Select Large Cap Growth Fund (UMLGX) is poised to end the year on a high note — doubling the performance of its Russell 1000 Growth benchmark and nearly doubling the S&P 500's 16.07% as of Oct. 16.This year's solid performance comes after a volatile 2016 full of macroeconomic events — like Brexit and the U.S. presidential election. Fund manager Thomas Galvin said the market has finally recalibrated its valuations for the type of quality growth stocks that the fund seeks, particularly in the technology and health care sectors. This has helped drive the fund's stellar performance.XQuality growth stocks are financially strong companies with compelling fundamental stories.The fund, comanaged by Richard Carter and Todd Herget, weights positions in its holdings based on the fund managers' level of conviction in the company. The conviction-weighted portfolio represents the management team's best ideas that could lead to significant price appreciation.The fund has seen significant success this year with high sector weightings in health care, technology and consumer cyclical. But in the latest reported quarter — as of Aug. 31 — the fund is reducing some of its exposure to the tech and health care sectors.As of Aug. 31, the fund had positions in 33 names. Of those 33 stocks, the IBD Best Mutual Funds 2016 Awards winner has made strong bets on two FANG stocks — Facebook (FB) and Amazon.com (AMZN) — and China-based Alibaba (BABA), amounting to almost 13% of the overall portfolio. These three firms are representative of the fund's search for high-quality secular growth stories.Facebook exemplifies what Galvin is looking for in companies, touting 17 consecutive better-than-expected quarterly earnings results and global brand awareness. Facebook's main site, Instagram and WhatsApp have unmatched global scale and allow precise targeting for advertisers.In the latest quarter, year-over-year earnings increased 69%, while revenue bumped up 45%. Looking forward to the current quarter — to be reported on Nov. 1 after the market close — analysts expect the firm's earnings to rise 42% on a 40% increase in sales.The social media giant moved past its 129.37 cup-with-handle buy point on Jan. 24 and never looked back. At its July 27 peak, the stock had advanced over 52% year to date. Now, the IBD 50 stock has formed a flat base with a 175.59 buy point. Shares are less than 3% away from the entry in the stock market today.The ""Amazon Effect"" has seen Amazon expand into a multitude of industries, including grocery stores with the late-summer acquisition of Whole Foods Market. Amazon is in the process of radically disrupting and transforming the e-commerce industry, to the benefit of its shareholders.Up until late July, Amazon was a top performing large-cap growth stock in 2017. On Feb. 16, the stock broke out above an 843.94 cup-with-handle entry. From there, the stock advanced as much as 28% to its record high on July 27.After suffering an earnings setback on that day — quarterly earnings declined 78% year over year — the stock would go on to fall 14% from its record high on Sept. 26 before rebounding. Now, the stock has gotten back above the 1,000 price level, and is forming a potential flat base with a 1083.41 buy point.Meanwhile, the fund also has an over-4% position in China-based e-commerce giant Alibaba (BABA). Alibaba has been one of the top leading growth stocks of 2017, rising more than 75% from a 104.67 classic cup-with-handle buy point. The stock pulled back to is 50-day moving average Monday, where it's testing support. It's 2.3% below a 177.10 ascending-base entry.Into the end of the year, the fund managers remain optimistic about chances that the fund will close out the year strongly. Galvin believes that unless there is an economic recession lurking around the corner, the market will continue to drift higher. Global economic growth and strong U.S. employment — the jobless rate is at a 16 year low — should create more upside potential for profit growth, leading to higher equity prices. However, the Nasdaq has already risen almost 23% this year, so potential upside may be more limited.The technology sector should remain strong through Q3 earnings season. Despite the expectation of continued strength, the fund has been reducing positions in that sector due to natural profit-taking.The fund is overweight in the consumer cyclical sector with Tractor Supply (TSCO) one of its newly added positions.Tractor Supply has rebounded in recent months after hitting multiyear lows in July 2017, but no proper buy point has emerged.RELATED:Looking For Top-Performing Mutual Funds?

Security experts believe another wave of computers will be hit by the attack this week.Proofpoint went public at 13 a share in April 2012. Currently, the stock holds a 79 Earnings Per Share Rating, but this rating is weighed down by net losses scored from 2008 to 2015. In 2016, the Sunnyvale, Calif., firm posted its first annual net profit as a publicly traded company, earning 37 cents a share.Now, the Street sees Proofpoint earning 12 cents a share in Q2, double vs. a year ago, and 58 cents a share for FY 2017, up 57%.Imperva (IMPV) broke out of a cup-with-handle base, rising past the 48.77 buy point in heavy volume. The base is part of a much larger pattern that stretches out to the start of 2016. Imperva is another member of the security software industry group, but is not a leader like Proofpoint or Symantec.Energy, chip and cyclical stocks such as machinery makers were among the best performing in today's trading.Yet on the downside, building products firms have been struggling lately.W.W. Grainger (GWW) fell 2% to the lowest level since January 2016. The building products company has been in a steep decline since peaking Jan. 25, exacerbated by an 11% plunge on its April 18 weak earnings report.Grainger holds a horrible Composite Rating of 18 from IBD Stock Checkup. Growth investors should focus on those with a 90 or higher.Its meltdown is part of a broad weakness in building products stocks. Beacon Roofing Supply (BECN), Tile Shop (TTS), Fastenal (FAST) and Tractor Supply (TSCO) are some of the stocks in the group struggling for many weeks.RELATED:This Top Software Stock Is Breaking Out; 3 Others Are In Buy RangeMicrosoft Lashes Out Over 'WannaCry' Hacks; Is Apple Next?

But the parent company of Google pulled back to a 0.4% advance to 864.40, with volume was tracking well below average. The mild price behavior also left something to be desired for the breakout. Alphabet may get into the auto insurance business as part of the growth in self-diving cars, a Morgan Stanley report said.The S&P 500 fell 0.1% while the small-cap Russell 2000 led with a 0.3% increase.The Dow Jones industrial average lagged with a 0.2% loss after a mysterious drop by Merck (MRK). The Dow component slid more than 2%, its biggest move since Feb. 2, when the pharmaceutical company announced earnings.

14,TSCO,"President Trump on Wednesday met with retail CEOs, promising to cut industry regulations and urging them to build more stores, while Target (TGT) afterward warned a proposed border tax would raise prices.Trump also promised a ""massive"" tax plan ""in the not-too-distant future."" That followed Trump's remarks to airline CEOs last week when he vowed to announce something ""phenomenal in terms of tax"" in the coming weeks.Wednesday's meeting included CEOs from Gap (GPS), AutoZone (AZO), Target, Tractor Supply (TSCO) and JCPenney (JCP), who were in Washington, D.C., to lobby the White House and Congress against the border tax.""We're cutting regulations big league,"" Trump said at the meeting, later adding, ""You have a very, very big regulatory problem, and we're going to take care of that, because I want more jobs.""He also pressed the executives on growth.""We want you to expand your stores,"" Trump said. ""You'll tell me why you will or why you won't. And tell me why you won't, we'll work on you a little bit.""The issue of a border tax did not come up specifically during the public remarks. But Target said later it was brought up, though didn't mention what Trump said about it.""They also discussed the … proposal for a border adjustability tax, which is a priority issue for Target because it will raise prices for American families on everyday essentials,"" Target said in a statement, according to CNBC.If enacted, Target said, such a policy ""would have profound implications for our guests and business, and at Target, we believe that anything that raises prices for families is not a good idea for America.""Trump did reiterate his administration's attempts to bring down the overall tax burden on businesses and simplify the tax code, so much so, that ""H&R Block probably won't be too happy — that's one business that might not be happy with what we're doing.""Shares of H&R Block (HRB) fell as much as 2% on the comment but pared losses and were down 0.8% to close at 20.80 on the stock market today.

"
15,TSCO,"Stocks wrapped Wednesday's session with modest gains, despite a powerful boost from Apple (AAPL), a spike in January job growth and a better-than-expected increase in January's manufacturing activity.The Nasdaq powered up 0.5%, while the Dow Jones industrial average added 0.1% and the S&P 500 booked a fractional gain. Small caps were under pressure during the session, leaving the Russell 2000 with a flat finish.The Dow and S&P 500 backed out of early gains ahead of the Federal Open Market Committee's midafternoon policy announcement, although the no-change, no-news release itself appeared to levy little impact on the rest of the day's trade.Today's stock market then turned its attention to Facebook (FB), which reported results after the close. The social media company beat sales and profit expectations, sending its shares up about 2% in extended trading. That would leave Facebook with an all-time high.Apple ended the day up 6% and at an 18-month high after blowing past analyst expectations in its fiscal first-quarter report delivered late Tuesday. At least nine analysts raised their price targets on the stock following the report, in which both sales and earnings growth turned positive after three quarters of declines.Chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) flashed 16% higher in a powerful rebound from support at its 10-week moving average. The company reported a narrow revenue beat and a 1-cent loss vs. expectations for a 2-cent loss.Office supplies brand Avery Dennison (AVY) filed a 9% advance, outpacing analysts' fourth-quarter revenue and earnings estimates and guiding full-year earnings above consensus forecasts.

16,TSCO,"Farm-equipment maker Deere & Co. (DE) reported fourth-quarter earnings on Wednesday that were much better than expected, helped by ongoing cost control efforts.Estimates: EPS down 63% to 40 cents, with revenue slipping 9.4% to $5.38 billion.Results: EPS fell 17% to 90 cents; equipment sales fell 5% to $5.65 billion.Outlook: Deere sees equipment sales falling 4% in fiscal Q1 and just 1% in fiscal 2017.Stock: Shares soared 11% to 102.17 in the stock market today, hitting an all-time high The stock is now greatly extended from breakout earlier this month from a cup base with an 88.73 buy point.AGCO (AGCO), which also makes farming equipment, rose 3.4%. Lindsay (LNN), a maker of irrigation systems, climbed 2%. Retailer Tractor Supply (TSCO) advanced 0.9%.Heavy construction and mining equipment maker Caterpillar (CAT), which does have some market overlap with Deere, rose 2.7% to its best levels since December 2014.Falling crop prices after massive harvests have reduced demand on farms for Deere's equipment. The company has expanded into Brazil, but the recession there and political upheaval combined with the stronger dollar have posed challenges to results. Still, the company's EPS in the third quarter far surpassed views.IBD'S TAKE: Goldman Sachs recently predicted Deere, Caterpillar, Cummins and Terex should see improved margins as key machinery end markets bottom out and manufacturing restructures. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB)  remains a shareholder in Deere but in August the holding company disclosed the sale of 1.32 million shares of Deere, a nearly 6% cut, bringing its stake down to 21.96 million shares.RELATED:Caterpillar Stock Soars On Trump Win On Hope For Coal; GE, Boeing UpDeere Crushes Profit Views On 'Great Job Cutting Costs'

17,TSCO,"Stocks were narrowly mixed Thursday afternoon amid another round of earnings reports. American Express (AXP) led the upside but Tractor Supply (TSCO) fell hard again, keeping its sharp downtrend intact.The Dow Jones industrial average eked out a small gain, while the Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 fell fractionally. Volume was running sharply higher on the Nasdaq but a touch lower on the NYSE. AmEx, part of the Dow, vaulted more than 10% to aid the blue chip average's cause.AmEx is trying to stop a downtrend that has lasted nearly two years. In late 2014, the charge account firm failed in an attempt to clear a saucer with handle base with a 92.69 pivot point. The large cap then proceeded to fall as much as 48% below its all-time peak of 96.24. But now shares are back above the 50- and 200-day moving averages.Aggressive traders may buy the stock if it surpasses 67.44, 10 cents above the April 21 peak.IBD'S TAKE: Do you know how to identify stocks that have bottomed out after a big price slide and may be breaking out? Read this Investor's Corner column to determine stocks that are turning around and potentially becoming new big winners.Among retailing stocks, Tractor Supply (TSCO) slid 4.5% to 64.33 in volume running nearly five times its usual level. The stock's 50-day average turnover is 1.98 million shares.Notice on a weekly chart how the former big winner and specialist in farm, pet and ranching products dived 19% in the week ended Sept. 9 in wild volume following news that it gave a sour outlook on same-store sales for the third quarter. Over the next five weeks, the stock made no attempt to recover, instead trading in a tight sideways range.Such action formed what IBD calls the L-shape pattern, a timely tool to help short sellers add to their winning positions.In Tractor Supply's case, one could have sold shares short on Oct. 17 when the stock took out the recent low of 66.43. As always, one must cut losses short at 7%-8% or less. But in this case, Tractor did not rally to force sellers to cover.Late Wednesday, Tractor posted a 5% increase in both earnings per share and sales; net margin dipped slightly to 5.8%.Elsewhere in the stock market today, HealthEquity (HQY) cooled off, falling 3% to 35.63 as it priced a follow-on offering, but is holding above its rising 50-day line. The HSA (health savings accounts) administrator has been in a sharp uptrend since breaking out past a 31.79 buy point in a nine-month cup with handle.NVR Inc. (NVR) got trampled by sellers as the luxury homebuilder fell nearly 4% to 1,556 in massive trading. An early-July breakout past a flat base at 1,820.10 failed, and the stock is now 14% off that peak.NVR reported a 5% bump up in Q3 earnings, down sharply from 31% growth in the year-ago quarter, as sales rose 10% to $1.54 billion. Both EPS and revenue missed views. It was the slowest top-line increase in seven quarters. Net margin slipped to 7.6%, down 70 basis points.RELATED:What Is The L-Shape Pattern?How Can I Quickly Get Started In The Art Of Short Selling?Which Companies Join HealthEquity As Elite Growth Names In Terms Of FY 2017 Earnings Estimates?Could AmEx Be Forming The Bottoming Base Pattern?

19,TSCO,"Tractor Supply (TSCO) shares plummeted to their lowest level in 22 months on Thursday after the farm-gear supply store slashed third-quarter and full-year forecasts late Wednesday.

But warning signs soon flashed.These signals should have spurred investors to sell. Even longtime holders -- Tractor Supply ran up 1,256% from its March 2009 low to its April 2016 peak -- would have wanted to book some profits as the stock broke key support levels.As for Wednesday night, Tractor Supply said it expects to earn 65 to 67 cents a share in Q3 and $3.22 to $3.26 for the year. Analysts had expected 71 cents in Q3 and $3.36 for the year. The retailer blamed weakness in oil-producing regions.CEO Greg Sandfort said in a statement: ""While the retail environment has become more challenging over the past several months, the most pronounced decreases in our traffic and sales are in energy and agricultural communities. With our customers generally being fiscally conservative, we believe many of them have responded to the economic uncertainty by reducing their purchasing patterns in some of our key geographic regions.""Signet Jewelers (SIG) -- parent of Kay's, Jared's and Zale's mall-based jewelry chains -- also recently warned about weak demand in the oil patch. 
"
20,TSCO,"Restoration Hardware (RH) reported better-than-expected second-quarter earnings and sales late Thursday, lifting shares of the upscale furnishings retailer and other stores after a bad day for many consumer stocks.Restoration Hardware earned 44 cents a share, crushing views for 29 cents. Sales were $543.3 million vs. views for $511.1 million. The retailer sees Q3 adjusted EPS of 13-18 cents, though that may not compare to analyst estimates fro 40 cents.

21,TSCO,"Stocks trimmed some losses, but remained down in generally weak trade on Thursday, as rising oil prices rescued the stock market today from a much deeper sell off.The Nasdaq slumped hardest, down 0.5%. The Dow industrials and the S&P 500 dipped 0.2% apiece.Oil prices traded up nearly 5%, sending West Texas Intermediate oil above $47 a barrel and to a gain of more than 7% so far this week. The gain, which followed a larger-than-expected draw on weekly oil supplies, puts oil on track for a potential rebound after a two-week pullback.Oil producers grabbed 14 of the 15 best gains among S&P 500 stocks, with Chesapeake Energy (CHK) and Diamond Offshore Drilling (DO) leading the charge, up 12% and 9%, respectively. Oil and energy groups posted seven of the 10 best gains among the 197 industry groups tracked by IBD. Department stores, gold miners and telecom-service providers posted some of the most hefty declines.Tractor Supply's (TSCO) 17% furrow was the S&P 500's worst decline.

Nike (NKE) also slumped more than 2%, hurt by a downgrade to neutral  from overweight by Piper Jaffray.Among IBD 50 stocks, Shutterstock (SSTK) notched the best gain, up more than 3%. Shutterstock has climbed 143% off a February low, and is extended above a 47.31 buy point after a July breakout.Veeva Systems (VEEV) rose more than 1%, edging back toward its Aug. 31 high. Veeva took the high after rebounding from 10-week support in powerful trade.

The deal values the acquired company at $4.4 billion. Following the acquisition, Liberty Media will change its name to the Formula One Group and trade under the ticker FWON.Home improvement retailer Tractor Supply (TSCO) collapsed nearly 16% to 70.23, good for a 52-week low.The Brentwood, Tenn.-based chain lowered its third-quarter sales and earnings guidance to below analyst views, and projected flat-to-lower comparable store sales, vs. a 2.9% gain a year ago.Also in the consumer sector of the market, luxury electric vehicle maker Tesla Motors (TSLA) shed 2% after Cowen & Co. initiated coverage with an underperform rating. Tesla shares have been mired in a five-month consolidation.Nike (NKE) fell nearly 2%, undercutting its 50-day moving average.

Nike has been consolidating since late March, and meeting resistance at its 40-week moving average for the past three weeks.Weekly unemployment claims eased slightly, to 259,000, in the week ended Sept. 3, the Labor Department reported. That was down from 263,000 claims in the prior week and a slight surprise for economists projecting an uptick to 264,000 new claims.The four-week moving average also dipped, to 261,250 -- its third straight decline.The Energy Information Administration reports weekly natural gas inventories at 10:30 a.m. ET, and oil supply data at 11 a.m. July consumer credit numbers are expected from the Federal Reserve at 2 p.m. ET.Oil rose nearly 2%, lifting West Texas Intermediate above $46 a barrel, ahead of the EIA data.

23,TSCO,"Some things are best judged if they aren't regarded in isolation. A film advertisement, for instance, once boldly trumpeted ""an endearing romantic comedy"" across a page and attributed the seemingly high praise to a movie review in a newspaper.The review actually read, ""political propaganda wrapped into an endearing romantic comedy that starts losing its laughs,"" but that was conveniently left out of the ad.Investing data can also be misleading if you are viewing only out-of-context facts.If a company reports a jump in revenue growth, an experienced investor will ask two questions: Is the company slashing prices to step up sales growth? Did the company make an acquisition that's boosting sales?Sales growth from an acquisition can be positive, especially if the acquisition is adding a higher-margin business.But sales growth driven by lower prices suggests the company's products are seeing weaker demand or that the products are being commoditized.Many products start out being high-margin items. But as more competitors emerge, they become lower-margin commodities. You want to catch a stock on the right end of that trend.So, when an investor notices an increase in sales, the first thing to check is IBD's SMR Rating, which stands for sales, margins and return on equity.IBD combines those three elements into one rating because they are interrelated. You can find the ratings at Investors.com in the stock quotes area and in Stock Checkup, and on the MarketSmith charts.The SMR rating's scale runs from A to E, with A being the best. Generally, you should avoid buying stocks with an SMR rating of D or E. Sometimes a turnaround candidate will have a C rating, but most top-rated stocks carry an A or B.The gauge is useful because sales growth built on low margins will hurt the SMR Rating. Return on equity is relevant because it measures how efficiently a company is using its net assets to make a profit.After the Dec. 20, 2011, follow-through day confirmed an uptrend was underway, the market remained in the uptrend for 67 sessions.In the first month after the follow-through, a number of quality stocks cleared buy points. They included InvenSense (INVN), Michael Kors (KORS), Monster Beverage (MNST), Sturm Ruger (RGR), Tractor Supply (TSCO) and Visa (V). Some of those entries were triggered by breakouts from bases and others from three-weeks-tight patterns. One was a short-stroke pattern.All of the companies mentioned above went on to rally 27% or more from their breakout points.(Editor's Note: This column originally published in the July 10, 2012, edition of IBD.)

24,TSCO,"Stock indexes remained mired near session lows Thursday afternoon as earnings news became the predominant factor in the the stock market today.The Nasdaq was down 0.4%, while the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.5%. The Dow transports fared worse, down 1.3%.Volume was tracking higher across the board. That indicates that institutional investors took some profits, though there's been little evidence of that the past few weeks. Losers led winners by 3-to-2 on the NYSE and by 9-to-5 on the Nasdaq.Mellanox Technologies (MLNX) tumbled 9%, enough to trigger the 8% sell rule for those who bought at the 50.79 buy point.

The chain of farming, pet and ranch supply stores announced Q2 profit and sales in line with estimates.

Insteel Industries (IIIN) shares soared more than 8% in heavy volume, sailing past the 31.93 buy point of a cup-with-handle base. The maker of reinforcing steel wire for concrete and construction jobs beat profit estimates. Despite flooding-related problems, the quarter's results benefited from both widening spreads between selling prices and raw material costs, as well as from an increase in shipments.

30,TSCO,"Despite the Brexit volatility, sparked by the U.K.'s June 24 vote to withdraw from the European Union, U.S. diversified stock mutual funds eked out a 1.79% gain on average in the second quarter, even as they lost 0.52% in June alone, according to Lipper Inc.The S&P 500 tacked on 2.46% in Q2, after inching up 0.26% in June.That's it for the good news. Stock fund managers are seeking durable-growth stocks as a hedge against the uncertainty, volatility and slowdown in corporate earnings that several told IBD they see in the months -- or longer -- ahead.Click Here To See A List Mutual Fund Quarterly Leaders""Before Brexit, the (investment) world was almost back to normal,"" said Matthew Ward, co-manager of Schroder U.S. Large Cap Equity strategy, which is run as a separate account. The Federal Reserve was edging toward an interest rate increase. First-quarter panic over the pace and sustainability of China's growth was subsiding. U.S. economic indicators were OK, with jobs and wages growing, home values inching up and consumers feeling confidence.""Then, Brexit,"" Ward said. ""We're back to uncertainty, and the market hates uncertainty.""As a result, going forward Ward says the stocks he wants are in a narrow group that have shown an ability to grow earnings regardless of the macro environment.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Six-Month Leaders""Our biggest overweight is in consumer discretionary,"" he said. ""It reflects our confidence in consumers. And in some durable secular trends. Amazon (AMZN) is at the top of our list.""Similarly, James Abate, sole manager of $156 million Centre American Select Equity (DHAMX) and of $53 million Multi-Asset Real Return (DHMUX), sees the best prospects for growth increasingly concentrated within an elite group. ""We're concentrating in names that somehow can buck the trend in terms of economic malaise,"" said Abate, who is also Centre's chief investment officer. ""The names in the new Nifty 50 bucket include Amazon, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Merck (MRK), Nvidia (NVDA) and General Mills (GIS).""Jim Swanson, lead manager of $3.4 billion MFS Diversified Income (DIFAX) and chief investment strategist of MFS Investment Management, was already bearish on stocks pre-Brexit.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Category Performance The outlook was already dim for corporate earnings growth, he said. He added that companies globally had already lost purchasing power. U.S. selling and general administrative costs, as well as labor costs, are rising. Productivity here, in Europe and in China is falling.Post-Brexit, the dollar is up vs. the Chinese yuan, which will hurt U.S. exports and U.S. multinationals' earnings, he said. A global movement toward trade protectionism, if realized, would also hurt earnings.""Brexit or not, we need to see excess capacity come out of the world manufacturing system and the return of some inflation so that companies can pass along price increases,"" Swanson said.Despite the threats to U.S. corporate earnings, Swanson is overweight in U.S. stocks vs. their Japanese and European peers, which have growth outlooks that look even dimmer to him. And he is underweight in stocks vs. bonds and cash.""U.S. corporate bonds are the place to be,"" he said. He's favoring a mix of high-grade and high-yield debt.Small-cap growth funds led market-capitalization and style groups among U.S. diversified stock funds in Q2, gaining 3.85%.World equity mutual funds barely advanced in Q2, edging up 0.27% while losing 0.64% in June. Latin American funds led all foreign regions, advancing 8.72% in Q2 and 10.72% in June.Up 26.16% year to date, Latin American funds have benefited primarily from a rebound from an excessive sell-off last year, as well as a rebound in the Brazilian real vs. the U.S. dollar and a bounce for oil and other commodities, according to Peter Taylor, a manager of $7.4 billion Aberdeen Emerging Markets (ABEAX) and $3.5 million Latin American Equity Fund (ALEAX). Brazilian stocks have also benefited from the ouster, at least temporarily, of President Dilma Rousseff and in market-friendly fiscal reforms, he says.The quarter's volatility enabled precious metals funds to lead sectors by soaring 40.63% in Q2, more than half of that in June.Going forward, Swanson feels best about the technology sector among U.S. stocks. ""Its free cash flow is the highest of all 11 S&P 500 sectors,"" he said. ""Despite talk of bubbles, the sector is trading cheaper than utilities in Ohio. Yet tech companies change the world.""Software is due to benefit from an overdue upgrade cycle, he says.His second-favorite sector is health care. ""Health care spending keeps rising as a portion of U.S. GDP,"" he said. ""It's priced fairly, not cheaply. It has the best profit outlook after tech.""Consumer discretionary is his third-favorite sector. ""Forward price-earnings ratios are high, but we're seeing year-over-year profit growth that's almost as good as tech's,"" he said.Among tech stocks, Facebook (FB) is one that Ward likes. ""They have exceptional top-line growth,"" he said. ""And they're growing their opportunities."" For one, viewers are tolerating a tripling of videos being shown by advertisers, which allows Facebook to triple the number of ads it inserts among videos.In health care, Ward says share prices have been beaten down, largely by investor concerns that drug pricing will draw additional regulatory scrutiny. But he still likes individual stocks in the sector, including Amgen (AMGN).""It is the cheapest with pharmaceuticals,"" he said. And it is creating market opportunities with a number of biosimilars, which are harder than previous generation treatments for rivals to replicate.Among consumer discretionary stocks, Ward likes Amazon because of top-line growth and its use of Prime to draw new site users. He also likes Amazon's use of its warehouse for storing inventory without the expense of purchasing it.Tractor Supply (TSCO) is another consumer discretionary name he likes. It caters to customers whose income is double the national average and who pursue a rural lifestyle, he says. Its sales are triple its next six competitors combined. Its scale enables Tractor Supply to customize inventory for different regions.In staples, he likes Monster Beverage (MNST). Its new carbonated drink, Mutant, and its distribution arrangement with partner Coca-Cola (KO) should keep growth in the high single digits or low double digits, he says. Wall Street expects low single digits, which makes the stock attractively valued, he says.David Harden, president of Summit Global Investments and lead manager of two of its funds -- $125 million U.S. Low Volatility Equity (LVOLX) and $11 million Small Cap Low Volatility (LVSMX) -- says that amid volatility he likes stocks with stability of revenue and earnings. ""These companies offer downside protection,"" he said.One trait shared by stocks he likes is stability of revenue and earnings. ""These companies offer downside protection,"" he said.Another trait is low two-year beta. Each one's beta is below 1.0, which means each is less volatile than the overall stock market.

32,TSCO,"It may not have the cachet of a Home Depot (HD) or Lowe's (LOW), but Tractor Supply (TSCO) -- a home products retailer for the pastoral set -- is seeing strong growth thus far in 2016.After a rare dip in same-store sales in the last three months of 2015, as unseasonably warm weather dampened demand for heating products, Tractor Supply came roaring back in the first quarter of this year.Fueled by increased store traffic, same-store sales at outlets open more than a year grew 4.9% in an otherwise typically slow period, with gains across a number of product types and regions. For the fourth quarter, same-store sales slipped 1.2%.""We’re off to a good start,"" Chief Executive Greg Sandfort said in a recent interview with Investor's Business Daily. ""We got back to normal business in the first quarter. It’s a good thing the (business) model is resilient.""Despite its name, the company likes to say it sells ""everything except tractors,"" though some of its products can be used to repair the farm vehicles. The company was founded in 1938 as a mail-order tractor parts business and it opened its first retail store a year later in Minot, N.D.Now based in a suburb of Nashville, Tenn., its mission has morphed over time. Tractor Supply sells basic maintenance gear and other products to farmers, animal owners, ranchers, hobby farmers and other customers who live what it calls the ""rural lifestyle"" well beyond metro areas. It also sells things that help repair wells and build fences, weld gates, construct feed bins and take care of livestock and pets.Customers own horses, chickens, goats and various pets -- lots of pets. Livestock and pet merchandise accounted for 44% of sales last year, the biggest category by far.Tractor Supply's niche rural market has served the company well, as it continues to open new stores around the country, 114 last year and 36 in the first quarter. It has more than 1,500 stores in 49 states, and aims to grow to 2,500 stores, up from a target of 2,200 a year ago.Earnings have grown 20% on a compounded average rate since 2012, though the fourth quarter saw barely any gain. Sales have been growing around 11% on average over that time.""The most remarkable thing to me is their ability to drive traffic to their stores,"" David Magee, an analyst at SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, told IBD. ""They’ve shown positive year-over-year traffic growth for a number of years. Most retailers are showing flat to down traffic because of e-commerce (competition) and the (slow) economy.""Tractor Supply's e-commerce sales are tiny and for a reason, Magee says.""(The company's merchandise) is stuff people need pretty quickly,"" he said. ""Their stores are convenient and easy to get in and out of. It's not the type of transaction people are anxious to do on a computer. It's like a hardware-store transaction.""Rivals are typically independent farm stores rather than the much bigger footprints of big-box home centers such as Home Depot and Lowe's. But nearly half of Tractor Supply's outlets, much smaller by comparison, are located close to either of those chains.Unlike most retailers, though, Tractor Supply doesn't have to stick to conventional rules for opening a store by sticking to clusters in targeted areas.""We can open stores across the country, one or two counties out from the large cities, where our customers live,"" CEO Sandfort said.Its highest volume stores are in the South and Northeast. Texas has the most outlets of any state, with 165 at the end of December.Job and population losses in the oil patch have been a concern. Texas underperformed relative to the overall chain, analysts say. But oil-impacted markets generated positive comps in the first quarter, analyst Seth Sigman said in a research note for Credit Suisse.""While they underperformed the control group, the spread was the same as Q4, in the 4%-5% range,"" he wrote.Added SunTrust's Magee: ""Texas is probably doing OK because the state is pretty diversified.""The next largest state after Texas by store count is Ohio, followed by Pennsylvania, Michigan and New York, the latter largely in rural upstate regions.""Not New York City, for sure,"" Sandfort said.Tractor Supply began shipping in December from a newly opened distribution center in Arizona to better serve a growing number of stores in Western states, and with an eye on lowering transportation costs compared with shipping points further afield.Sandfort says the company has become more efficient through business-management technology. For example, it uses a pricing module from a third-party provider to fine-tune pricing by local markets.The company tweaked its inventory flow in the first quarter to five dates from three so that southern states could sell spring merchandise earlier and northern states their cold-weather products longer. That, along with pricing, helped margins as well as to reduce inventory levels, said Barclays’ analyst Matthew McClintock in a recent research note.Tractor Supply also has been rolling out a number of new products, many based on strong results from tests in select stores. A kayak was introduced last year after a successful test run and has since become a “tremendous hit,” Sandfort said.""Customers typically have a lake or pond on their property. This year we have a far larger assortment in stores,"" he said, adding that the plastic kayaks are similar to ones carried by Dick’s Sporting Goods (DKS) and privately held outdoor-products chain REI.After posting a scant 1% growth in per-share earnings in the fourth quarter vs. a year ago, Tractor Supply seems to be back on its usual double-digit track. First-quarter earnings jumped 19% to 50 cents and analysts expect 13% to 19% gains the next three quarters. They see the year ending up 16% vs. 2015 to $3.49 a share.Management kept its 2016 outlook at $3.40-$3.48 in per-share earnings and 3.5%-5% same-store sales growth.JPMorgan analyst Christopher Horvers wrote in a recent note to clients: ""We believe this will ultimately prove conservative given the strong start to the year and easier comparisons in the back half.""

35,TSCO,"The major indexes continued a slow burn in early-afternoon trading Thursday, hurt by another day of intense selling in one of the best-performing sectors this year -- the utilities.The Dow Jones utility average shot 2.2% lower amid the recent jump in long-dated U.S. Treasury bond yields. On Thursday, the 10-year yield headed toward 1.9%, up sharply from its Feb. 11 low of 1.63%. With positive economic data arriving week after week, it's possible that the market is anticipating higher inflation, which would justify the Federal Reserve's decision to press on with additional rate hikes.The U.S. central bank raised its fed funds rate target by 25 basis points in December last year to a range of 0.25% to 0.5%. Higher interest rates boost operating costs at utilities and also makes their dividends less competitive.The Dow Jones industrials and the S&P 500 each fell 0.4%. The Nasdaq composite was trading flat in the stock market today; volume was running at a moderately higher pace vs. the previous day on the NYSE and was roughly even on the Nasdaq.Back to the Dow utilities, all but one of the 15 components were seeing sharp declines. The Dow utility average, noted in the latest Big Picture column, and the SPDR Utilities (XLU) sector ETF were falling further below their respective 50-day moving averages in heavy volume, a key sell signal.Consolidated Edison (ED) fell more than 3% in volume running 91% above average. The provider of gas and electricity to New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania on Thursday said it's investing $975 million in a 50-50 gas storage and pipeline joint venture.Water supply and wastewater treatment firm American Water Works (AWK) gapped down early Thursday and fell 3% in below-average volume. The stock remains above its rising 50-day moving average and is up more than 15% past a 59.30 base-on-base buy point.On the upside, generic drug makers, apparel makers, educational software firms, specialty enterprise software names and biotechs all rallied sharply. Under Armour (UA) and farming and ranching goods retailer Tractor Supply (TSCO) continue to act well, rising 8% and 5%, respectively. UA, which reported Q1 results this morning, is nearly 5% past a 45.53 cup-with-handle buy point; Tractor, which serves rural communities throughout the U.S., is holding above a 92.10 entry on a long cup-like base.Tractor Supply late Wednesday posted a 19% rise in earnings to 50 cents a share, the biggest EPS increase since a 20% lift in the year-earlier quarter. Sales picked up 10% to $1.47 billion; the average year-over-year revenue increase in the prior four quarters was 9%. Wall Street continues to see modest double-digit EPS growth both this year and the next. Tractor earns an 86 Composite Rating from IBD Stock Checkup.
"
36,TSCO,"Tractor Supply (TSCO) reported accelerating earnings and sales growth late Wednesday, as the farming and ranching retail supply store topped Wall Street forecasts.The Brentwood, Tenn.-based company earned 50 cents a share in Q1, up 19% from a year earlier, and beating by four cents estimates of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. Revenue rose 10% to $1.47 billion, beating estimates of $1.45 billion. That ends a three-quarter string of decelerating EPS growth and two quarters of slowing sales growth.""Sales were broad-based, with all of our major product categories and geographic regions generating positive comparable store sales,"" Tractor Supply said in a release.Tractor Supply shares surged about 5% in late trading to around 95. That would be a breakout from a nine-month consolidation. Shares closed up 0.5% to 90.07. The stock had been finding support around its 200-day moving average for more than a month.Q1 comparable store sales rose 4.9%, largely on increased traffic, with pet and livestock food a strong segment. That's a deceleration from the 5.7% increase in the year-earlier quarter.Tractor Supply reaffirmed its full-year guidance for EPS of $3.40-$3.48 and net sales guidance of $6.9 billion and $7 billion. Both are in line with analyst forecasts. The retailer sees full-year same-store sales growth of 3.5%-5%.Tractor Supply targets hobby and small-scale farmers vs. large-scale operations. It has more than 1,500 stores, mostly in rural and exurban areas, They sell everything from tractor parts to horseshoes to steel fasteners to welding torches and farm-related apparel. A sizable share of each store's goods are localized for specific markets.In Q1, Tractor Supply opened 36 stores and closed three old ones. It plans to open 115-120 stores this year with an ultimate store-count goal of around 2,500 stores.Not surprisingly, Tractor Supply's business is highly seasonal. The winter Q1 tends to be Tractor Supply's slowest quarter, while the spring Q2 tends to be its busiest.""Although we are off to a solid start in the first quarter, we recognize the importance of the spring selling season to our first half performance,"" Tractor Supply CEO Greg Sandfort said in the release.Riding lawn mowers and fencing products did well in Q1 as early spring weather pulled sales forward.Many of Tractor Supply's products could be found at home improvement chains such as Home Depot (HD) or Lowe’s (LOW), but Tractor Supply believes it has the breadth of offerings in the right quantities for its customers. With less than 1% of sales online, Tractor Supply hasn't seen Amazon (AMZN) as a big threat so far.Tractor Supply has increased sales for 60 consecutive quarters, according to MarketWatch.The company's success comes amid challenging times for U.S. farmers overall. In February, the U.S. Department of Agriculture forecast that farm net income will be $54.8 billion this year, down 2.8% from 2015's estimate.If the forecast comes to pass, it will be the third consecutive year of slumping profits for U.S. farmers, after soaring to a record $123.3 billion in 2013. Excess crop and livestock production has sent prices downward and has forced some farmers to work through their supply gluts.Corn, the No. 1 crop in the U.S. by volume, earlier this year saw its price decline more than 50% since 2012.Soybeans and wheat prices have been cut in half during that period, but are bouncing back.Soybean prices have hit an eight-month high amid damaging rains in Argentina, increased China demand and expectations that U.S. and Argentine farmers won't plant as many acres of the crop in the upcoming months.Wheat prices are at a five-month high, boosted by market strength and investor-short covering by hedge fund managers.

44,TSCO,"Deere's (DE) fiscal fourth-quarter earnings blew away Wall Street estimates, and its stock gapped up Wednesday on the agriculture and construction equipment giant's upbeat comments about prospects in 2016.The company projected that its equipment sales will be down about 11% year-over-year in Q1 to around $5.31 billion, topping estimates of $4.89 billion.It sees full-year sales declining about 7% to around $23.98 billion, below Wall Street views of $24.24 billion.But Deere guided fiscal 2016 net income to $1.4 billion, a 28% dive but above consensus for $1.29 billion.""Although our forecast calls for lower results in the year ahead, the outlook represents a level of performance that is considerably better than we have experienced in previous downturns,"" Chairman and CEO Samuel Allen said in a statement.Deere closed up 4.8% Wednesday in trading on the stock market today, pushing the stock back above its 50-day average. Among other companies in the farm machinery group, AGCO (AGCO) rose 1.3% and Lindsay (LNN) was off a small fraction.Farm supply retailer Tractor Supply (TSCO) was up 0.2%. In the related construction and mining machinery group, Caterpillar (CAT) edged up 0.1%.Deere expects total industry sales for agricultural equipment in the U.S. and Canada to be down 15% to 20% for 2016. The decline, which reflects the impact of low commodity prices and stagnant farm incomes, is expected to be most pronounced in the sale of higher-horsepower models.In fiscal Q4, earnings per share minus one-time items dropped 49% to $1.08, beating analyst consensus by 33 cents a share. Deere has beaten quarterly earnings estimates for more than two years in a row. Equipment sales fell 26% to $5.93 billion in Q4, below consensus for $6.12 billion.The Q4 earnings beat came ""in the face of further weakness in the global agricultural sector and a slowdown in construction-equipment markets,"" CEO Allen said.Economic growth in emerging markets such as China has shrunk this year, and Deere cited a weak energy market in the U.S., which has led to lower purchases of construction equipment by oil and gas companies. Additionally, an unfavorable currency translation effect of 5% for the quarter and the full year impacted sales for the quarter.Deere's equipment net sales in the U.S. and Canada slid 23% in Q4. Outside the U.S. and Canada, net sales were down 31% for the quarter.Agriculture and turf sales fell 25% in Q4 to $4.66 billion.

46,TSCO,"Many retailers, especially those largely dependent on brick-and-mortar stores for sales and profits, are suffering through a rough patch, but home improvement chains such as Home Depot (HD) and Lowe's (LOW) should do just fine, analysts say.Home Depot will report third-quarter results Tuesday, followed by Lowe's on Wednesday. Both are expected to log double-digit profit growth on sales gains in the mid-single digits.The home improvement sector marches to its ""own drummer"" — the housing market — ""and should be less impacted by the recent retail malaise,"" said analyst Scot Ciccarelli of RBC Capital Markets in a client note.Private fixed-residential investment, viewed as a proxy for U.S. housing-related spending, was up 10.7% in the third quarter from a year earlier, the fourth straight quarter of double-digit growth, he noted.Home Depot's earnings are seen rising 19% from a year ago to $1.32 per share on revenue of $2.18 billion, up 6%, according to analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. Lowe's is expected to earn 78 cents per share, up 32% from last year, on revenue of $1.43 billion, up 5%.While an unseasonably warm autumn can disrupt retail sales patterns, it might actually have benefited the two home improvement chains by extending the busy summer/fall selling season, he said.And he noted ""fairly positive"" commentary from vendors such as Sherwin-Williams (SHW), Fortune Brands (FBHS) and Whirlpool (WHR) during the third quarter.However, rural lifestyle chain Tractor Supply (TSCO) faced ""modest weather-related headwinds"" on heat-related products during the warmer-than-usual quarter. But overall, Tractor Supply benefited from the extended summer selling season, the analyst said.Shares of Home Depot, which tumbled 3% on Friday, closed up 0.7% on the stock market today. Lowe's finished 2.2% higher after losing 3.6% Friday.Home Depot and Lowe's both earn Composite Ratings from IBD of 82 out of a best-possible 99, based on metrics such as growth in earnings and stock, but that is down from the low 90s three months ago.Follow Marilyn Alva on Twitter @IBD_MAlva.

83,TSCO,"In July 2011, Tractor Supply (TSCO) broke out of a flat base en route to a new high. The farm supply retailer rose 12% above the 65.10 buy point to a peak of 73.09 on July 7, 2011 (1). Investors had no reason to suspect that anything was wrong — until a few weeks later, when the stock began selling off in heavy volume. By Aug. 8 — just a month after it had hit a new high — Tractor Supply lost a third of its value.
"
84,TSCO,"What happened?
"
85,TSCO,"The short answer is that the market had fallen into a serious correction. The Nasdaq ultimately fell 20%, the technical definition of a bear market. Such a correction is a timely sell signal for your stocks.
"
86,TSCO,"When a correction happens, growth stocks tend to fall much faster than the overall market. Usually, the leaders will drop 1-1/2 to 2-1/2 times the market's decline. Investors must anticipate a major downturn coming before the sell-off does lasting damage to their portfolios.
"
87,TSCO,"The key to doing that? Pay attention to a rush of heavy distribution in the market.

89,TSCO,"Rising volume as the market sells off is a sign of heavy selling by institutional investors. So when you see a sharp increase in the number of distribution days, even as the market is rallying, it means that a correction could be just ahead.
"
90,TSCO,"An occasional distribution day won't hurt an uptrend. But a cluster of heavy selling days — usually five or six or more — within several weeks is a bad sign. Keep a lookout for sell signals in your stocks, with the aim of locking in profits, cutting losses short and raising cash quickly.

299,TSCO,"The Brentwood, Tenn.-based company is the largest farm and ranch chain in the U.S. Tractor Supply sells everything from riding mowers to tools to animal feed to clothing and footwear. It has more than 1,100 stores across 44 states.
"
300,TSCO,"Tractor Supply was hit by the tough economic times in 2008. That's when earnings dropped 9% to $1.10 a share from the previous year. But profit jumped 49%, 38% and 34%, respectively, over the next three years.
"
301,TSCO,"The company's earnings have nearly tripled since 2008, and analysts are expecting another double-digit gain for this year.
"
302,TSCO,"Tractor Supply is off to a good start toward that goal. Last month, it beat expectations with a 129% surge in Q1 EPS and a 22% gain in sales. Top-line growth has now accelerated for three straight quarters. Earlier, Tractor Supply had raised its full-year profit outlook.

310,TSCO,"Lead manager Matthew Kamm works the market like it's a garden with variety. He treats his young sprouts differently from his mature produce, and both of those differently from crops he's ready to reap.
"
311,TSCO,"This approach is working. It has made his $9.7 billion Artisan Mid Cap Fund a top performer among the largest diversified U.S. stock portfolios.
"
312,TSCO,"In the 12 months ended Jan. 31, its 31.18% return topped 91% of its midcap growth peers tracked by Morningstar Inc. Its 16.94% average annual gain in the past three years topped 92% of its rivals.
"
313,TSCO,"Kamm, 40 years old, discussed his investment course with IBD from his office in Milwaukee.
"
314,TSCO,"IBD: In addition to Mid Cap, you run $906 million Artisan Global Opportunities and $1.7 billion Small Cap . How does managing different cap-size and style funds help you?
"
315,TSCO,"Kamm: Our team includes a group of analysts and five portfolio managers who work collaboratively to identify best ideas. We've been at this over 15 years. That level of tenure and trust is important.
"
316,TSCO,"We look up and down the market-cap scale and globally. That gives us broad perspective. We like to think we're better midcap investors because we know small-cap competitors and international emerging markets competitors that U.S. midcap companies increasingly face.
"
317,TSCO,"IBD: You divide your portfolio into three types of stocks. What's the advantage?
"
318,TSCO,"Kamm: The nomenclature we use is garden, crop and harvest.
"
319,TSCO,"Garden stocks are ones we believe are just emerging. We try to be early into them. We guard against risk by keeping garden positions small.
"
320,TSCO,"When a garden position turns out right and profit growth plays out, we allocate more into it and push it into our crop bucket or portfolio. Those are our largest positions and fewest positions. That's where we feel the profit cycle has been largely de-risked.
"
321,TSCO,"The third area is harvest, where we reduce positions.
"
322,TSCO,"IBD: How are you tweaking new buys to cope with the expected slow-growth economy?
"
323,TSCO,"Kamm: We've been focused on uniquely positioned franchises that are exposed to some strong growth trends. You see some signs, especially in the U.S., that the economy is getting better. Housing and jobs are examples. But emerging markets are struggling to grow at the same rates they experienced a few years ago.
"
324,TSCO,"We're focused on durable, high-quality franchises. We're less interested in high-commodity businesses and materials. And those business models are very cyclical, economy sensitive, but tend not to meet our franchise characteristics criteria.
"
325,TSCO,"IBD: What are some real-world examples, please, as of your latest disclosure?
"
326,TSCO,"Kamm: We're focused on innovation in health care. We're 10 years past the first sequencing of the human genome. Now we're seeing benefits in novel drug targets.
"
327,TSCO,"Regeneron (REGN) is an example. They have a drug called Eylea, which is a retinal drug for age-related macular degeneration, the leading cause of blindness for the elderly. It was launched in 2011. In its second full year it sold $1.4 billion. It's a strong driver of company sales and profits.
"
328,TSCO,"Regeneron also has a diverse pipeline of additional opportunities to extend its profit cycle into the future.
"
329,TSCO,"They were all discovered in Regeneron's own labs, but primarily funded by Sanofi, a large French drug company, in return for the ability to market these drugs and share profits.
"
330,TSCO,"IBD: Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) recently gapped up after reporting strong results and guidance. Its 30% earnings per share growth was the second straight quarterly acceleration. What's your thesis?
"
331,TSCO,"Kamm: We think they're positioned for growth. They have a very strong brand associated with high-quality ingredients. They have a significant opportunity to grow their footprint of restaurants in the U.S., and ultimately internationally.
"
332,TSCO,"They're executing well. They're getting customers through serving lines quicker. They've enhanced menus. They're offering office catering. They're able to drive solid same-store comps year-over-year and make restaurants more profitable through higher volumes.
"
333,TSCO,"They've resisted increasing prices to the same extent that a lot of restaurants have. Instead, they're driving growth through higher volume and traffic.
"
334,TSCO,"IBD: Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) has had a great run and just gapped up the other day. What makes you think it still has room to run?
"
335,TSCO,"Kamm: It fits our innovation theme. Their sales and profits are driven by Solaris, a biologic drug that's approved for two ultrarare, very serious diseases, not just in the U.S. but globally.
"
336,TSCO,"They still have room to run because both uses of Solaris still have a lot of growth ahead of them. There's still a lot of opportunity to reach more patients.
"
337,TSCO,"Solaris is also being tested for three or four additional ultrarare diseases, where early clinical data are encouraging. In three or four years, there will be additional (treatment) approvals for Solaris.
"
338,TSCO,"They also have asfotase alpha (which targets certain bone diseases and tooth losses), which is expected to be approved later this year.
"
339,TSCO,"IBD: Is broker-dealer LPL Financial (LPLA) a play on a growing economy?
"
340,TSCO,"Kamm: They're the largest independent broker-dealer in the country. They've grown by attracting financial advisers away from big banks and wire houses, giving them independence to grow their practices in ways they see fit, and letting them keep a larger percent of their profits.
"
341,TSCO,"They continue to gain market share, and we like market-share gainers. We like companies that can outgrow the market in a sustainable way.
"
342,TSCO,"Also, LPL captures some of the float on cash balances that customers keep with them. (Float refers to earnings on cash between the time a customer authorizes disbursement and when the cash actually leaves the account.) While rates were low, there was not so much float to capture. But if rates rise as the economy improves, then LPL earnings will accelerate.
"
343,TSCO,"IBD: Where's the innovation in a stock like athletic wear seller Under Armour (UA)?
"
344,TSCO,"Kamm: The innovation is in new materials that deliver better performance, whether sweat-wicking or shielding athletes from heat or cold. Companies like Under Armour and Nike (NKE) and Adidas have been able to grow by innovating product lines and driving increased value to customers.
"
345,TSCO,"Under Armour has a great brand with athletes, especially young athletes, who are inclined to spend more. They're expanding into other categories, such as footwear via cleats. And that's translating into more traditional ware like running shoes.
"
346,TSCO,"They've been mostly a U.S. brand, but they're extending their brand internationally and driving additional growth outside the U.S. So we think they still have a long runway. They're in our bucket category.
"
347,TSCO,"IBD: Am I right in thinking you like Illumina's (ILMN) genomic sequencing advances?
"
348,TSCO,"Kamm: Gene sequencing is a transformational technology. In 2007 they launched a next-generation sequencing platform. Cost of sequencing began to fall, leading to big growth in the market. They launched (on Jan. 14) another new product (the HiSeq X Ten) that delivers the first $1,000 genome, a target that researchers have been fixed on for five or six years.
"
349,TSCO,"So they're the center of action in human genetic research and have significant growth opportunities as they make these tools even more affordable.
"
350,TSCO,"IBD: TripAdvisor (TRIP) has pulled back from its Nov. 15 high. And earnings per share fell in the most recent quarter. Why aren't you concerned?
"
351,TSCO,"Kamm: They're the leading review site for hotels and other travel destinations globally. They've moved toward a bidding model, where companies bid for placement on a TripAdvisor site. It's almost like bidding for Google (GOOG) search terms. Earnings have declined during this process because it is a transition. They're foregoing some older advertising measures as they move customers to the new bidding system. Until this new system starts to mature, their profits are lower.
"
352,TSCO,"This was expected. That's why it's a garden investment. It will move up as they get through the transitional period.
"
353,TSCO,"IBD: Cepheid (CPHD) has uptrended since June. Why has it shown so much volatility in quarterly earnings?
"
354,TSCO,"Kamm: This is a crop position. They make diagnostic systems that let hospitals easily identify molecular markers of disease in patients. That used to be a complex, time-consuming process that required highly trained staff. Cepheid made GeneXpert, which automated it. You put a blood sample into a plastic cartridge, which goes into the instrument, and you get the answer. So more hospitals can do molecular testing.
"
355,TSCO,"The company ran into manufacturing challenges, which hurt earnings. Over (the past year) they've addressed those issues, exited 2013 in a better place in terms of inventory and ability to provide test cartridges to customers. And they have a broad pipeline of new tests that they've brought to market. Now they have to leverage their new systems to do a broader range of tests.
"
356,TSCO,"IBD: Is Fortune Brands (FBHS) a play on the housing rebound?
"
357,TSCO,"Kamm: They're a leading housing-products company, and this is a crop position.
"
358,TSCO,"They have a leading position in fixtures for kitchens and bathrooms, cabinets, faucets and locks in what tend to be attractive segments. It became clear last year that the U.S. housing market was coming out of the depths of the downturn. Fortune has been gaining share in key markets. That's delivering strong margin expansion, and margins are still below the peaks of the last housing cycle, so it's reasonable to assume that margins can continue to rise.
"
359,TSCO,"IBD: The rate of growth of LinkedIn's (LNKD) earnings per share have declined for two quarters. You've added to your stake in several recent disclosures. What's your game plan?
"
360,TSCO,"Kamm: LinkedIn has transformed the recruiting and hiring market. The main advantage is that people update their resumes and profiles even when they're not actively looking for a job. People who are hiring can access a rich database of not just job-seekers but also of people who would be open to the right opportunity. That's valuable to corporate HR departments.
"
361,TSCO,"In recent years LinkedIn has been investing to improve its mobile smartphone and tablet tools and provide more content, more articles and experts who write on topics that are relevant. That brings people to the site more frequently and with a higher level of engagement. And that translates into more advertising dollars for LinkedIn. There's not only a growing number of recruiters who subscribe to the platform. There's also growing advertising business. All of this has a long way to run.
"
362,TSCO,"IBD: You began your current stake in Melco Crown Entertainment (MPEL) in September. Why do you like this particular casino stock?
"
363,TSCO,"Kamm: They're a leading casino operator in Macau and the Cotai Strip (in Macau), which is well known as a high-growth market, noticeably larger than Las Vegas. The subtle shift in the market in recent years is that the market is no longer driven primarily by high rollers, ultrahigh net worth individuals gaming in Macau. It is driven by the mass market today.
"
364,TSCO,"Melco's properties are well positioned to serve the mass market. And that part of the market is more profitable than the high-net-worth part. Melco is working to open new properties, which will expand its earnings potential.
"
365,TSCO,"Also, transportation to Macau is improving. And we're seeing changes that make it more attractive for destination travel, not just gambling demand.
"
366,TSCO,"IBD: Your stake in Tractor Supply (TSCO) has edged up.
"
367,TSCO,"Kamm: They're the leading supply store for recreational farms and the rural lifestyle. They have 1,300 stores today. We think they have potential for at least 2,100 stores. As they grow, they've done a good job of increasing productivity of existing stores. They've done a good job of understanding their business data.
"
368,TSCO,"They've done a good job with e-commerce to leverage their brand outside their physical stores. They've done a good job of laying in private label goods within the store to provide different price points and help expand their own margins. All of those drivers have potential in the coming years.Lead manager Matthew Kamm works the market like it's a garden with variety. He treats his young sprouts differently from his mature produce, and both of those differently from crops he's ready to reap.This approach is working. It has made his $9.7 billion Artisan Mid Cap Fund a top performer among the largest diversified U.S. stock portfolios.In the 12 months ended Jan. 31, its 31.18% return topped 91% of its midcap growth peers tracked by Morningstar Inc. Its 16.94% average annual gain in the past three years topped 92% of its rivals.Kamm, 40 years old, discussed his investment course with IBD from his office in Milwaukee.IBD: In addition to Mid Cap, you run $906 million Artisan Global Opportunities and $1.7 billion Small Cap . How does managing different cap-size and style funds help you?Kamm: Our team includes a group of analysts and five portfolio managers who work collaboratively to identify best ideas. We've been at this over 15 years. That level of tenure and trust is important.We look up and down the market-cap scale and globally. That gives us broad perspective. We like to think we're better midcap investors because we know small-cap competitors and international emerging markets competitors that U.S. midcap companies increasingly face.IBD: You divide your portfolio into three types of stocks. What's the advantage?Kamm: The nomenclature we use is garden, crop and harvest.Garden stocks are ones we believe are just emerging. We try to be early into them. We guard against risk by keeping garden positions small.When a garden position turns out right and profit growth plays out, we allocate more into it and push it into our crop bucket or portfolio. Those are our largest positions and fewest positions. That's where we feel the profit cycle has been largely de-risked.The third area is harvest, where we reduce positions.IBD: How are you tweaking new buys to cope with the expected slow-growth economy?Kamm: We've been focused on uniquely positioned franchises that are exposed to some strong growth trends. You see some signs, especially in the U.S., that the economy is getting better. Housing and jobs are examples. But emerging markets are struggling to grow at the same rates they experienced a few years ago.We're focused on durable, high-quality franchises. We're less interested in high-commodity businesses and materials. And those business models are very cyclical, economy sensitive, but tend not to meet our franchise characteristics criteria.IBD: What are some real-world examples, please, as of your latest disclosure?Kamm: We're focused on innovation in health care. We're 10 years past the first sequencing of the human genome. Now we're seeing benefits in novel drug targets.Regeneron (REGN) is an example. They have a drug called Eylea, which is a retinal drug for age-related macular degeneration, the leading cause of blindness for the elderly. It was launched in 2011. In its second full year it sold $1.4 billion. It's a strong driver of company sales and profits.Regeneron also has a diverse pipeline of additional opportunities to extend its profit cycle into the future.They were all discovered in Regeneron's own labs, but primarily funded by Sanofi, a large French drug company, in return for the ability to market these drugs and share profits.IBD: Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) recently gapped up after reporting strong results and guidance. Its 30% earnings per share growth was the second straight quarterly acceleration. What's your thesis?Kamm: We think they're positioned for growth. They have a very strong brand associated with high-quality ingredients. They have a significant opportunity to grow their footprint of restaurants in the U.S., and ultimately internationally.They're executing well. They're getting customers through serving lines quicker. They've enhanced menus. They're offering office catering. They're able to drive solid same-store comps year-over-year and make restaurants more profitable through higher volumes.They've resisted increasing prices to the same extent that a lot of restaurants have. Instead, they're driving growth through higher volume and traffic.IBD: Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) has had a great run and just gapped up the other day. What makes you think it still has room to run?Kamm: It fits our innovation theme. Their sales and profits are driven by Solaris, a biologic drug that's approved for two ultrarare, very serious diseases, not just in the U.S. but globally.They still have room to run because both uses of Solaris still have a lot of growth ahead of them. There's still a lot of opportunity to reach more patients.Solaris is also being tested for three or four additional ultrarare diseases, where early clinical data are encouraging. In three or four years, there will be additional (treatment) approvals for Solaris.They also have asfotase alpha (which targets certain bone diseases and tooth losses), which is expected to be approved later this year.IBD: Is broker-dealer LPL Financial (LPLA) a play on a growing economy?Kamm: They're the largest independent broker-dealer in the country. They've grown by attracting financial advisers away from big banks and wire houses, giving them independence to grow their practices in ways they see fit, and letting them keep a larger percent of their profits.They continue to gain market share, and we like market-share gainers. We like companies that can outgrow the market in a sustainable way.Also, LPL captures some of the float on cash balances that customers keep with them. (Float refers to earnings on cash between the time a customer authorizes disbursement and when the cash actually leaves the account.) While rates were low, there was not so much float to capture. But if rates rise as the economy improves, then LPL earnings will accelerate.IBD: Where's the innovation in a stock like athletic wear seller Under Armour (UA)?Kamm: The innovation is in new materials that deliver better performance, whether sweat-wicking or shielding athletes from heat or cold. Companies like Under Armour and Nike (NKE) and Adidas have been able to grow by innovating product lines and driving increased value to customers.Under Armour has a great brand with athletes, especially young athletes, who are inclined to spend more. They're expanding into other categories, such as footwear via cleats. And that's translating into more traditional ware like running shoes.They've been mostly a U.S. brand, but they're extending their brand internationally and driving additional growth outside the U.S. So we think they still have a long runway. They're in our bucket category.IBD: Am I right in thinking you like Illumina's (ILMN) genomic sequencing advances?Kamm: Gene sequencing is a transformational technology. In 2007 they launched a next-generation sequencing platform. Cost of sequencing began to fall, leading to big growth in the market. They launched (on Jan. 14) another new product (the HiSeq X Ten) that delivers the first $1,000 genome, a target that researchers have been fixed on for five or six years.So they're the center of action in human genetic research and have significant growth opportunities as they make these tools even more affordable.IBD: TripAdvisor (TRIP) has pulled back from its Nov. 15 high. And earnings per share fell in the most recent quarter. Why aren't you concerned?Kamm: They're the leading review site for hotels and other travel destinations globally. They've moved toward a bidding model, where companies bid for placement on a TripAdvisor site. It's almost like bidding for Google (GOOG) search terms. Earnings have declined during this process because it is a transition. They're foregoing some older advertising measures as they move customers to the new bidding system. Until this new system starts to mature, their profits are lower.This was expected. That's why it's a garden investment. It will move up as they get through the transitional period.IBD: Cepheid (CPHD) has uptrended since June. Why has it shown so much volatility in quarterly earnings?Kamm: This is a crop position. They make diagnostic systems that let hospitals easily identify molecular markers of disease in patients. That used to be a complex, time-consuming process that required highly trained staff. Cepheid made GeneXpert, which automated it. You put a blood sample into a plastic cartridge, which goes into the instrument, and you get the answer. So more hospitals can do molecular testing.The company ran into manufacturing challenges, which hurt earnings. Over (the past year) they've addressed those issues, exited 2013 in a better place in terms of inventory and ability to provide test cartridges to customers. And they have a broad pipeline of new tests that they've brought to market. Now they have to leverage their new systems to do a broader range of tests.IBD: Is Fortune Brands (FBHS) a play on the housing rebound?Kamm: They're a leading housing-products company, and this is a crop position.They have a leading position in fixtures for kitchens and bathrooms, cabinets, faucets and locks in what tend to be attractive segments. It became clear last year that the U.S. housing market was coming out of the depths of the downturn. Fortune has been gaining share in key markets. That's delivering strong margin expansion, and margins are still below the peaks of the last housing cycle, so it's reasonable to assume that margins can continue to rise.IBD: The rate of growth of LinkedIn's (LNKD) earnings per share have declined for two quarters. You've added to your stake in several recent disclosures. What's your game plan?Kamm: LinkedIn has transformed the recruiting and hiring market. The main advantage is that people update their resumes and profiles even when they're not actively looking for a job. People who are hiring can access a rich database of not just job-seekers but also of people who would be open to the right opportunity. That's valuable to corporate HR departments.In recent years LinkedIn has been investing to improve its mobile smartphone and tablet tools and provide more content, more articles and experts who write on topics that are relevant. That brings people to the site more frequently and with a higher level of engagement. And that translates into more advertising dollars for LinkedIn. There's not only a growing number of recruiters who subscribe to the platform. There's also growing advertising business. All of this has a long way to run.IBD: You began your current stake in Melco Crown Entertainment (MPEL) in September. Why do you like this particular casino stock?Kamm: They're a leading casino operator in Macau and the Cotai Strip (in Macau), which is well known as a high-growth market, noticeably larger than Las Vegas. The subtle shift in the market in recent years is that the market is no longer driven primarily by high rollers, ultrahigh net worth individuals gaming in Macau. It is driven by the mass market today.Melco's properties are well positioned to serve the mass market. And that part of the market is more profitable than the high-net-worth part. Melco is working to open new properties, which will expand its earnings potential.Also, transportation to Macau is improving. And we're seeing changes that make it more attractive for destination travel, not just gambling demand.IBD: Your stake in Tractor Supply (TSCO) has edged up.Kamm: They're the leading supply store for recreational farms and the rural lifestyle. They have 1,300 stores today. We think they have potential for at least 2,100 stores. As they grow, they've done a good job of increasing productivity of existing stores. They've done a good job of understanding their business data.They've done a good job with e-commerce to leverage their brand outside their physical stores. They've done a good job of laying in private label goods within the store to provide different price points and help expand their own margins. All of those drivers have potential in the coming years.

369,TSCO,"Jim Wright doesn't pay lip service to the corporate culture.He lives it.The CEO of Tractor Supply (TSCO) says an integral part of his job is to nurture the deep-rooted values that pervade every corner of the farm and ranch supplies' retailer.""The culture of a company is like the sand on a beach,"" Wright, 62, told IBD. ""Wind and water are always eroding it. It's the job of leadership to replenish the culture one grain at a time, all the time.""That attitude is apparent in the tools that Wright uses to instill the culture. He requires all employees to carry a card listing 10 corporate values at all times. First on the list is ethics: ""Do the right thing and always encourage others to do the right, honest and ethical things.""The other values are: respect, balance, winning attitude, communication, development, teamwork, change, initiative, accountability.The back of the card enumerates the elements of Tractor Supply's mission: ""To work hard, have fun and make money by providing legendary service and great products at everyday low prices.""The Wright TeamSaid Wright: ""I am the custodian of the mission and values. We hire to them, interview to them, and assess candidates against them. If someone breaches them, we say goodbye. They are nonnegotiable and foundational.""Wright has maintained that commitment to Tractor Supply's ""culture of mission and shared values"" since he became CEO in October 2004. He added chairman to his title in November 2007.Sales grew to $4.23 billion in 2011 from $1.74 billion in 2004. Its stock price has soared along with that revenue run: 420%.Wright has built Tractor Supply into the largest operator of retail farm and ranch stores in America, with 1,085 stores that sell everything from pet products to tools that meet the lifestyle needs of recreational farmers and ranchers.""Under his leadership, the company has transitioned into one of the best performers in hardlines retail,"" said Wedbush Securities analyst Joan Storms. ""That has translated to a strong stock performance, cash flow and earnings power.""The corporate values, developed in the 1980s, provide a ""straight line of normative behavior which we all walk, starting with me,"" said Wright, noting they're also posted in public areas and work spaces in its store support center at headquarters in Brentwood, Tenn.""We live to these values,"" said the firm's president, Greg Sandfort. ""When everyone in the company is truly focused on these values, you gain alignment, and through alignment you gain momentum.""Wright says the main drivers of the business are what he calls the retail engine, a concept he diagrams on paper.Listed at the top are the elements of the culture that protect the engine — including ""values, ethics, collaboration and risk taking.""Listed below are the aspects of the business that drive sales and profits. They are ""customer loyalty, team member loyalty, vendor loyalty and shareholder loyalty.""Wright says he makes sure his firm sustains a solid team that grasps its customers and markets. As the kingpin in the market, it enjoys a ""tremendous scale and speed advantage"" vs. small, privately held farm store retailers.Wright adheres to a philosophy that nurtures all crucial practices — from collaboration to risk taking — that boost the company.""I strive to be a servant leader and expect others on the team to do the same thing,"" he said. ""The reason I do so is no one in the company is farther from the customer than I am.""Wright acknowledged that most U.S. companies adhere to a ""hierarchical pyramid,"" with the CEO at the top of it. ""I turn it upside down and place myself at the bottom so I'm burdened, not privileged, by my job. That places me in a position where I stay humble, and encourage others to stay humble.""Good ConnectionThe idea, he said, is to ""educate and empower each successive layer"" leading to the top of the pyramid — where store associates reside — so they ""delight"" customers.He added that a leader must state a vision clearly so every team member knows it, ""internalizes it, owns their piece of it and takes pride in the pursuit of shared goals.""""He's an inspirational leader and really does instill that sense of ownership with the company,"" said Storms. Wright has ""done a phenomenal job"" of building a top-notch management team.Wright emphasizes to job candidates that Tractor Supply is all for one, one for all. And he pushes management to sustain that dynamic.When he sees someone in an environment of friction, he steps into the breach. ""We rarely have to step in,"" said the boss. ""Most people want to work collaboratively, and there's no tension.""Way AheadWright's collaborative approach helped the company weather the economic downturn.Looking at data collected at the stores, his team saw changes in customers' behavior early on. Shoppers were deferring discretionary purchases, doing their own repairs and using less credit.""Based on that, in January 2008 we called the recession,"" said Wright. ""We believed we were dealing with a concerned, conservative consumer who was acting like we were in a recession.""Two months later his team communicated a game plan to 1,200 employees, from store managers up. To save customers money in a way that would draw them in, Tractor Supply brought them the best prices it could on the most needed products, such as consumables and edible goods like animal feed. The firm also cut costs in the store support center. ""As an example, we asked people to go back to their work stations and see if they had more than two Post-it note pads or more than two pens,"" said Wright.If they did, they were asked to keep two and turn in the rest.It was a way to get people's ""hands and hearts"" involved in the initiative, as he put it.Then there was this Wright pledge to all Tractor Supply team members: ""If they were with us at that time and continued to contribute, they would have a job with us at the end of the recession or I would have failed in my job.""The effect was powerful. In 2008 and 2009, Tractor Supply added 165 stores, created over 1,600 jobs and achieved record sales and earnings both years.Wright, a 43-year veteran of retailing, came to Tractor Supply as president and chief operating officer in 2000 after serving as CEO of Tire Kingdom, a car service outfit.On From WisconsinWright, a native of Oshkosh, Wis., says that before he joined Tractor Supply he was in the market for a new opportunity and was contacted by a recruiter to consider it. After meeting with the board and team and studying the stores and customers, he grew interested.""This was a company in the retail industry with a significant opportunity to become bigger and ultimately better,"" he said.Wright has worked to achieve that goal ever since.

The S&P 500 and NYSE composite pulled back 0.5% and 1.1%, respectively.

391,TSCO,"How To Profit From MAKING MONEY: Third In A SeriesIt would be nice to have a crystal ball that lists the stocks that will be this year's big winners, wouldn't it? Alas, crystal balls have their proper place only in psychics' rooms and Harry Potter movies.In the real world, investors can benefit from a mechanical screen of stocks that are outperforming the broader market and have the potential to jump to new highs en route to outstanding gains.IBD research has shown that when a stock forms a key chart pattern, such as a cup with handle, then shoots out of that base to new highs in thundering volume, the probability of making gains of 20%, 50% or more over a relatively short period of time is at its greatest.Why? Big runs occur because demand for that stock is swamping supply. Think of IBD Stock Spotlight as the screen to help you find stocks ready to make that big run.A stock that doubles or triples in price must first possess the power to make new highs soon after the breakout. Spotlight acts as a wide net that helps you capture these emerging leaders, often while they are still in their bases.You'll notice that stocks making this feature may be large cap or small cap; trade millions of shares daily or fewer than 400,000 shares daily; either be a veteran name on Wall Street or a new issue.What they do have in common is an enviable combination of good fundamentals and unusual relative price strength. Each mini-chart shows EPS, RS and Composite Ratings and other relevant data. In Friday's IBD, the lowest Composite Rating was a 90 for AutoZone (AZO); 10 others had a 99, five had a 98.Remember: This is not a buy list, but a source to sculpt a watch list. The column next to the charts will help you pinpoint the right time to buy and if any sell signals have appeared.When Select Comfort (SCSS) was showcased in the Nov. 22 Spotlight column 1, the mattress store chain had already surged out of a deep, jagged base. But it soon flashed new buy points, such as a rebound off the 10-week moving average 2, and a breakout from a new cup with narrow handle 3.Other leaders featured in Spotlight before or just as they broke out included Tractor Supply (TSCO) (Nov. 25), Sturm Ruger ( (RGR) (Dec. 9) and SolarWinds (SWI) (Dec. 16).

October's IBD Top 10 New America list shows the tremendous diversity of the innovative companies continually emerging in America. Among this month's leaders is Buffalo Wild Wings, a fast-growing casual restaurant chain with 800 locations that has tapped into America's seemingly insatiable appetite for New York-style wings. On the other end of the spectrum are companies like Polaris Industries, one of the top suppliers of all-terrain vehicles to the military in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as an emerging manufacturer and seller of motorcycles, including the Victory and Indian brands. Buffalo Wild Wings and Polaris join Under Armour, Red Hat, Tractor Supply and five other top-rated companies recognized by Investor’s Business Daily in October. The bottom line is that these companies are producing results through their innovation. But it takes more than innovation to make this month's IBD Top 10 New America list. Consistently, these companies show strong earnings growth, a solid return on equity and nice profit margins. Most of these companies are also in market-leading industries.

499,TSCO,"How To Profit From MAKING MONEY: Last In The 11-Part SeriesThe IBD 50 list is the signature standard among IBD's CAN SLIM-focused arsenal of investing tools.Compiled weekly from stocks showing strong fundamentals and promising chart action, it is the top-shelf source for savvy investors building watch lists.The list leads the MAKING MONEY section on Mondays. It also runs on the eTables page at Investors.com and is updated daily on Leaderboard. Few leaders squeak by and into rally-leading roles without passing through the IBD 50 ranks near the beginning of their runs.The 50-stock roster lists the strongest stocks first. This week, Apple (AAPL), Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) and Lululemon Athletica (LULU) top the list. All carry a best-possible Composite Rating of 99 from IBD.The last three names on this week's list are no weaklings. Netease.com (NTES) carries a Composite Rating of 96 and is up 29% year-to-date. Ubiquiti Networks (UBNT) rates a 93 and has gained 56%. Salix Pharmaceuticals (SLXP) also rates a 96. It has gained 11% so far this year, and just cleared its first base, with a 50.86 buy point, since exiting a 14-month correction.The IBD 50 is not a buy list.In a market correction, even IBD 50 stocks can drop fast. In fact, leading stocks can fall 1-1/2 to 2-1/2 times the decline of the major indexes. So always make sure that the Market Pulse in The Big Picture points to a market in uptrend before putting cash to work.Also, pay close attention to the stock mini-charts, at the bottom of which you will find concise analysis of the stock's most recent action and guidance on the appropriate buy point.The left side of each page names each company and includes a blurb about fundamentals or news. This feature also includes 10 separate data points, including earnings, sales, relative strength, return on equity and management ownership data.The charts present a dense array of vital information on company fundamentals, share float, debt and numerous other factors.Going back to the NYSE composite's follow-through on Oct. 12 last year provides a good gauge of the list's effectiveness.Numerous stocks on the list, ranging from Tractor Supply (TSCO) to Fastenal (FAST), have gained 30% to 50% or more since the market's follow through. Not all were in bases or near buy points at the time of the follow through.Some, like Alexion, barely paused for the market's July-to-August correction. Others did not break out until January of this year.Don't treat the IBD 50 as a fool-proof investing advisor. Arco Dorados (ARCO) and Eldorado Gold (EGO) are just two examples of stocks on the list that have had problems since the Oct. 12 follow through.Investors must always keep their sell rules handy.

The stock is forming a deep base after tumbling nearly 53% from its Nov. 4 record high. Deep corrections make for riskier bases. JinkoSolar is a Chinese maker of solar cells and modules.

"
548,TSCO,"For the week, IBD 50 stocks actually managed to gain a little ground on average, edging up 0.2%.

558,TSCO,"Late on Nov. 3, the energy drinks maker reported third-quarter earnings per share that missed the Street's forecasts by a penny.

639,TSCO,"Market leaders advanced for a second straight week in 2011 as investors began digesting early results for the fourth quarter.Earnings season will heat up quickly despite a holiday-shortened week. Apple (AAPL), Google (GOOG), F5 Networks (FFIV) and IBM (IBM) all report results.This is one reason why buying breakouts can be tricky in January. An earnings beat or a buoyant outlook can send a stock surging past a buy point or padding its gains. An earnings miss or dismal outlook can send a stock crashing back into a base or below it.Techs continued to grab a leading role in the 4 1/2-month uptrend. VMware (VMW) added 2% last week. It's just barely above the 5% buying range after sneaking past a 92.05 buy point in a cup with a high handle.The base began to form when the virtualization and cloud software firm fell 2.5% for the week ended Oct. 1. That decline triggered a slide that lasted three more weeks, all in heavy volume.In the first of those three weeks down, VMware fell 7% and volume doubled from its weekly average. But the stock also closed within the upper 60% of its weekly range. Institutions likely stepped in and bought shares to support the stock. The losses were also small in the next two weeks.Illumina (ILMN) rallied for a second straight week and marked new highs.

Its dull EPS and RS Ratings put the Dow component well below the caliber of IBD 50 firms.While financials make up a 16.2% weighting within the S&P 500, the only financial firm in the IBD 50 is EZCorp (EZPW), which rose 1.07 to a new high of 29.63 Friday. Volume more than doubled vs. the daily average as the stock thrust above a 28.85 buy point from a three-weeks-tight pattern.IBD 50 stocks forming bases include Ebix (EBIX) and Semtech (SMTC). Rovi (ROVI) and Tractor Supply (TSCO) got support at their 10-week lines.For the week, stocks in the IBD 50 on average gained 2.6%, after a 1.4% advance the prior week. The Nasdaq rose 1.9% and the NYSE composite 2.4%.

"
678,TSCO,"The Nasdaq, which sank 2.2% over Wednesday and Thursday's sessions, slipped an additional 0.6% after rallying 0.7% in the first 30 minutes of the session. Volume rose on the NYSE and fell from Thursday's heavy levels on the Nasdaq.

679,TSCO,"Mega-caps played catch-up again as the Dow advanced 0.7% for the week and its eighth straight weekly gain. The Dow is up 2.5% since Jan. 1, tops among the major indexes. The small-cap S&P 600, in contrast, is down 1.3% for the year.
"
680,TSCO,"A number of IBD 50 stocks struggled Friday after taking big hits earlier in the week. This was especially the case for companies working to enhance the speed and efficiency of Internet networks. F5 Networks (FFIV) finished the week down 24%, Acme Packet (APKT) 12% and Riverbed Technology (RVBD) 8%. All three remained above their 50-day or 200-day moving averages.
"
681,TSCO,"VMware (VMW), the leader in server virtualization, held onto most of Friday's gains as it rose 1.5% and held above 90, formerly a level of resistance.
"
682,TSCO,"Polycom (PLCM) pulled back from its highs, yet still finished with a 15% gain. Volume cruised more than six times its 50-day average to its highest level since July of last year. The stock busted out of a seven-month consolidation in October and has rallied 32% past a 34.24 buy point. An investor might have been able to find an earlier entry point by drawing a trend line across the highs from the base's left side.
"
683,TSCO,"The videoconferencing gear firm posted strong Q4 earnings and sales growth, up 48% and 27%, respectively, as after-tax margin of 12.7% hit its highest level since Q4 2008. EPS growth has accelerated over the past three quarters (7% to 17% to 23% to 48%), a typical characteristic of great stocks. 
"
684,TSCO,"GE (GE) continued the Dow's unlikely charge as the U.S. market's top index so far in 2011. The diversified giant gapped up 7% in heavy volume and extended its gain from a breakout from a long cup with handle at a 17.59 buy point. The stock also pierced resistance near 20 seen in April of last year and will likely see its weak 39 Composite Rating improve significantly next week.
"
685,TSCO,"GE posted 29% growth in Q4 earnings to 36 cents a share, marking a third straight quarter of double-digit gains, as revenue edged up 1%, the first year-over-year increase in nine quarters.

704,TSCO,"Tractor Supply broke out of a base in 2002, but its real move didn't kick off until mid-2003.
"
705,TSCO,"The long post-bubble decline of 2000-02 caused a lot of damage, and not just among technology names. A look at the top stocks from October 2002 shows a slew of defensive issues: banks, HMOs and soap makers. It would have been easy to miss a potential winner just because it was a member of IBD's Your Weekly Review.
"
706,TSCO,"Tractor Supply (TSCO) was already falling when the tech bubble burst in March 2000. The ensuing chaos seemed to add some oomph to the stock's decline. It bottomed at 1.63 a share (adjusting for splits) in November 2000.
"
707,TSCO,"From there, Tractor Supply built a long and steady uptrend, braving some nasty market head winds along the way.
"
708,TSCO,"What made Tractor Supply so hot to begin with? Sales growth had ticked up preceding its breakout for two straight quarters, from 8% to 19% to 47%.
"
709,TSCO,"Quarterly profit hadn't yet kicked in, which would have caused some investors to wait for a future base. But annual EPS was slated to rise 34% in 2002 and 33% in '03.
"
710,TSCO,"Tractor Supply's compelling story: more than 300 stores serving hobbyist ranchers and farmers who enjoy the rural life. The average customer was 44 years old, with an income 15% above the national average.
"
711,TSCO,"When a market follow-through appeared Oct. 15, what would you have seen in Tractor Supply? A great business niche and a stock that had established a torrid prior uptrend. 
"
712,TSCO,"But the handle was loose 1. From top to bottom, it showed a 22% range. You really don't want to see much more than a 12% swing.
"
713,TSCO,"So the base was not identifiable as a clear cup with handle. You could have treated it as a rebound from the 10-week moving average, and that would have worked for a while.
"
714,TSCO,"In mid-October, volume exploded to almost five times its norm. The stock gapped up and surged 19%, closing near the day's high 2.
"
715,TSCO,"The stock gained more than 40% until it started a new correction.
"
716,TSCO,"Look at what proved to be the near-term peak, the Nov. 29 week 3.
"
717,TSCO,"Volume suddenly got squelched and stayed that way for weeks 4. The stock fell below its buy point and the 10-week moving average in the ensuing weeks.
"
718,TSCO,"But that decline was just Tractor Supply's setting-up process.
"
719,TSCO,"The stock carved a cup from that Nov. 29 peak to a trough in the March 7, 2003, week at 29.38 5.
"
720,TSCO,"As Tractor Supply moved up the right side of its base, it left in its wake a correction that ran 35%  quite acceptable.
"
721,TSCO,"The pattern was smoother than the earlier one.
"
722,TSCO,"Tractor Supply built a high handle from May 9 through May 30 6.
"
723,TSCO,"This handle ran 17% deep  still a bit more than the ideal. But most of the drop came in one week in which the stock reversed to erase most of its losses, closing in the same familiar neighborhood as other weeks in the handle. What's more, it made for three straight weeks of narrow price closes  a positive sign.
"
724,TSCO,"Tractor Supply broke out June 2 past its 46.31 buy point 7.
"
725,TSCO,"By this time, the stock market had made a follow-through that confirmed a new uptrend, one that would last much longer than what followed the October 2002 follow-through.

What's more, it made for three straight weeks of narrow price closes  a positive sign.Tractor Supply broke out June 2 past its 46.31 buy point 7.By this time, the stock market had made a follow-through that confirmed a new uptrend, one that would last much longer than what followed the October 2002 follow-through.The stock nearly doubled over the next five months and offered several follow-on buy areas along the way.

727,TSCO,"Stock funds delivered more gains in February, but the stock market's pullback at month-end took a big bite out of the advance. The pullback coincided with uprisings in the Middle East, especially in oil exporter Libya, which sent gold and oil soaring. The average diversified stock fund rose 3.47%, according to Lipper Inc.

728,TSCO,"Rural Americans have long known Tractor Supply Co. (TSCO) as a place to find rugged work clothes for men. Now, with its customer profile changing, the farm and ranch supply chain is doing the same for women. 
"
729,TSCO,"In September, Tractor Supply launched an expanded apparel and footwear section for women. It boasts a full line of work clothes — from premium Carhartt-branded jackets to Wrangler tops and jeans — and an array of footwear under high-end labels such as Ariat. 
"
730,TSCO,"With 320 stores in 28 states, Tractor Supply serves mostly part-time farmers and ranchers. Only 10% of customers are full-time farmers. Until recently, two-thirds of them were men. Today, 50% are women. 
"
731,TSCO,"""I expect we will continue to become a more important resource of basic clothes and maintenance products for women,"" said Chief Executive Joe Scarlett. 
"
732,TSCO,"Scarlett hopes a combination of print, direct-mail and TV advertising will drive more women into the stores. He also intends to tailor women's clothes to regional needs and styling preferences. 
"
733,TSCO,"But Tractor Supply isn't going after the trendy set. The firm is sticking to basic, utility-type fare, in part because fashionable clothes proved a flop in a recent 18-month test offering in 12 stores. 
"
734,TSCO,"That styling strategy should lessen the company's fashion risk and help it better meet the demands of its customers, says analyst Eric Marshall of First Dallas Securities Inc. 
"
735,TSCO,"The expanded apparel department, rolled out in 280 stores, also boasts a wider selection of work wear for men. That includes more Ariat leather footwear, a new line of hats under the Resistol label and more offerings under the Wrangler and Carhartt labels. 
"
736,TSCO,"Enhancing the chain's clothing selection is part of Scarlett's plan to turn Tractor Supply into a one-stop shop for rural lifestyles, watchers say. 
"
737,TSCO,"Also, by confining its offerings to a narrow niche — high-end work clothes — it's keeping with his ongoing merchandising strategy. 
"
738,TSCO,"""We tell our buyers to stay out of the headlights of the big-box retailers, because we don't want to go eyeball to eyeball with people who have more purchasing power and bigger stores than we do,"" Scarlett said. 
"
739,TSCO,"So he goes out of his way to distinguish Tractor Supply's products from those sold at the mass merchants and home superstores. 
"
740,TSCO,"""They stay away from the mass commodity items... and stick with specialty type, farm-related products,"" said Marshall. ""They're staying with mainly high-end, work-related clothes like Carhartt jackets, which you can't find at Wal-Mart (Stores Inc.).""
"
741,TSCO,"That's not all Tractor Supply does differently than Wal-Mart. It also carries a wider array of products such as feed, containment fencing, pitchforks and harvest equipment. 
"
742,TSCO,"""It's done a great job merchandising products and finding niches in their retail category where they can sell a lot of products outside the radar screen of home improvement centers and mass merchants,"" said analyst David Campbell of Davenport & Co.
"
743,TSCO,"In the tool category, it offers more metalworking supplies than the home centers, which typically focus more on woodworking, he says. 
"
744,TSCO,"Tractor Supply has come back strong from a lackluster 2000, when year-over-year earnings fell 4% due mostly to drought conditions in many areas where it operates
"
745,TSCO,"It also faced tough comparisons from 1999, when sales surged as people rushed to its stores for items like generators in anticipation of Y2K problems. 
"
746,TSCO,"Things are better now. In the third quarter, the company's earnings more than doubled from a year ago to 27 cents a share. Sales grew 14% to $199.4 million. Sales at stores open at least a year, or same-store sales, rose 6.8%. 
"
747,TSCO,"Analysts polled by First Call expect full-year earnings to rise 25% to $2.34 a share, then gain 12% to $2.62 in 2002. 
"
748,TSCO,"More normal weather conditions this year in Texas — even accounting for the recent storms — and other key markets have boosted same-store sales growth, Marshall says. People are spending more time baling hay and handling other chores, which helps drive traffic. 
"
749,TSCO,"The company's new merchandising programs have also given it a lift. It's doing a better job adjusting its product mix so it doesn't overlap with nearby home-improvement chains, Campbell says. 
"
750,TSCO,"And through better inventory management, it's carrying 10% less inventories per store. At the same time, Tractor Supply is staying in stock with about 97% of its top 400 items. 
"
751,TSCO,"Meanwhile, the company is weathering the weak economy well. 
"
752,TSCO,"""Their business is highly driven by maintenance products like fencing materials and equine products, and people take care of their pets and do repairs regardless of the economy,"" said Marshall.

753,TSCO,"Still, Scarlett remains cautious.

1316,TSCO,"If applying for certain retail jobs at Tractor Supply (TSCO), you'd better come with plenty of equine know-how and a green thumb.

1317,TSCO,"It pays to know the meaning of words like tack (leather products for horses) or hard keepers (horses that lose weight easily).
"
1318,TSCO,"Hiring people with special skills in horses or farming has become a staple and revenue booster at Tractor Supply, the biggest rural retailer in the U.S., with 976 stores in 44 states.

1319,TSCO,"Many players talk about knowing customers. But analysts say one sure way to reach them involves hiring the right employee who understands a client's concerns. Companies that recruit staff with specific know-how can enhance profitability. At the same time, experts say identifying the right job candidate can be tricky.

"
1323,TSCO,"James Wright, CEO of Brentwood, Tenn.-based Tractor Supply, says creating a reservoir of staff knowledge helps retain both customers and employees. ""Only with longevity of staff can we build deep category expertise,"" he said.
"
1324,TSCO,"Since many customers own horses, staffers with four-legged expertise can offer advice on horse training, nutrition and care, and speak the ""horse language,"" Wright says. The staffers, called team members at Tractor Supply, build rapport, develop close ties with customers and close a sale, which leads to return customers.
"
1325,TSCO,"In addition to technical smarts, Tractor Supply also seeks staffers with an upbeat attitude. ""We seek someone with a bounce in their step, who's gregarious, positive and not grumpy,"" Wright said. Indeed, when customers enter a store, staffers greet them with an upbeat hello and a smile.
"
1326,TSCO,"Wright describes the company's recruiting philosophy as ""hiring hard and managing easy."" Hence, hiring includes tough job descriptions and extensive interviewing. But once on board, staffers receive incentives for boosting sales and recognition for outstanding performance.
"
1327,TSCO,"Employee turnover used to be a problem. But over the last 10 years, the upbeat employee retention approach has cut turnover in the retail staff from 100% to 35% annually. On the store manager side, it's fallen from 43% to 15%.
"
1328,TSCO,"A stable staff helps to fuel store expansions. The company plans to open 75 to 80 stores in 2011, an 8% jump from the prior year. Robert W. Baird & Co. senior retail analyst Peter Benedict calls the plans ""a measured pace of growth"" rather than expanding too quickly.
"
1329,TSCO,"Benedict praised Tractor Supply's customer service. ""They are staffed with people who live that lifestyle,"" he said. If a customer has a broken riding mower or needs to mend a damaged fence, staffers offer problem-solving suggestions on how to repair or replace it.
"
1330,TSCO,"""They've identified their core customer and know how to serve them,"" Benedict said. He describes the primary customer as someone who owns property with large animals, which could be a farmer, a rancher or a banker who lives on rural property with horses.
"
1331,TSCO,"Benedict says everyone knows about Wal-Mart but Tractor Supply often falls under the radar screen. Rural clientele know it, but consumers won't find Tractor Supply in most malls or strip centers where the vast majority of customers shop. Yet, Benedict says, the company is executing its business model flawlessly.

Dan Erling, author of ""Match: A Systematic, Sane Process for Hiring the Right Person Every Time,"" says many companies go awry when hiring staff with specific know-how.

1346,TSCO,"It's often hard to figure out when to sell a stock.Ideally, you've bought a name that will become a tremendous stock market winner, like Apple (AAPL), Baidu (BIDU) or Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG).But realistically, you can't expect every stock in your portfolio to perform like a champ. While a few might, others will only provide a solid gain, rather than a remarkable one. And others will head south, offsetting your winners.Given this range of outcomes, IBD advises locking in your profits for at least some of your winners when the gains reach 20% to 25%.It can be a good idea to prepare in advance for this sale. When you buy a stock priced at, say, 100 a share, you can make a note to yourself to sell at 120 or 125.One reason to sell after a 20% or 25% gain is to avoid sitting through the stock's next consolidation. Time and time again, leading stocks catch their breath after advances of 20% or 25%.If you have plenty of conviction in a name, then you'll want to sit tight through that period of price consolidation, which IBD calls a base. But you probably won't be completely enamored with every stock, so you'll want to declare victory with some names and move on.Often, this will help you steer clear of a round trip with a stock. That means achieving a sizable profit, but then seeing it evaporate as the stock comes back to your buy point.At the same time, selling for a gain of 20% or 25% doesn't prevent you from buying the stock back. You could let it shape a new base, then establish a position again on the breakout from the new base.Earlier this year, Tractor Supply (TSCO) offered an opportunity to take a profit at 25%.The farming equipment retailer cleared a 75.58 buy point from a flat base in early January 1, not long after the Dec. 20 follow-through day that signaled a new market uptrend.You could have established a position at that level, then made a note to sell at about 94.48 — when your profit hit 25%. With this goal in mind, you would have sold in early April 2.This would have saved you from taking a round trip that was completed in July 3.

"
1385,TSCO,"Its 4.95% gain in 2011 topped its peers' -3.55% average and the S&P 500's 2.11% gain.
"
1386,TSCO,"The fund has done that by aiming for small caps with a multiyear growth cycle in front of them.
"
1387,TSCO,"Co-lead managers Thomas Ognar, age 41, and Joseph Eberhardy, 44, along with 51-year-old manager Bruce Olson discussed their strategy with IBD from their offices in Menomonee Falls, Wis.
"
1388,TSCO,"IBD: Many investors are looking for companies with the resources to weather a stormy market and with little European exposure. That leads them to large U.S. multinationals. As small-cap investors, how are you coping?
"
1389,TSCO,"Olson: To be effective and analyze companies and try to model their growth going forward, we need to take account of market environments.
"
1390,TSCO,"But we don't think of the world first from a macro perspective. We look for companies like LogMeIn (LOGM), which provides on-demand remote connectivity software. Once we identify it as a growth company with the characteristics we want, we ask how the macro environment can impact its growth. Is it factored into its stock price?
"
1391,TSCO,"We look for stocks with a gap between what we think a company's value is given its growth prospects and where the stock price is.
"
1392,TSCO,"When there's at least a 20% upside to where it should be valued in perhaps one year, that's a stock we want if it shows the other characteristics we want.
"
1393,TSCO,"IBD: That underappreciation is one of three characteristics you seek, right?
"
1394,TSCO,"Olson: Correct. We look for smaller, new, faster growing companies with three characteristics.
"
1395,TSCO,"One is a robust growth, in the top 25% of cash flow and earnings in its industry.
"
1396,TSCO,"It must be at least 10% annual revenue and earnings growth.
"
1397,TSCO,"Second is growth that is sustainable. It can do that by creating a new market or taking market share. It can have a differentiated product or service that can continually grow at least 10% annually.
"
1398,TSCO,"And third is that 20% upside.
"
1399,TSCO,"IBD: But what about the danger of investing in small caps when many investors are tilting towards large caps?
"
1400,TSCO,"Olson: Smaller caps can be more volatile. We just try to take advantage of that volatility. We look for those gaps between price and potential.
"
1401,TSCO,"IBD: So have you been buying and adding to names you like as they pull back?
"
1402,TSCO,"Olson: We do put money to work in volatile periods. One thing (shareholders) should realize is that U.S. corporations, if you look at their cash as a percentage of assets, is at an all-time high, going back 50 years. And corporations are using that cash.
"
1403,TSCO,"It is being deployed in smaller companies like Brigham Exploration (BEXP) (being acquired by Statoil (STO), NetLogic Microsystems (NETL) (being acquired by Broadcom (BRCM) and SonoSite (SONO) (being acquired by Fujifilm Holdings). Big companies put that cash into faster growing assets, which a lot of times are stocks that we've invested in. So small caps can benefit from how large caps redeploy their cash through M&A activity.
"
1404,TSCO,"IBD: Do you wear blinders to limit your vision just to small caps?
"
1405,TSCO,"Ognar: We've found that doing research on mid and large caps helps us with small caps.
"
1406,TSCO,"To be good investors in small caps like Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) or Hibbett Sports (HIBB) or Life Time Fitness (LTM), we have to research Nike (NKE), Under Armour (UA) and Wal-Mart (WMT). And we can own either in our multicap fund ($7.2 billion Wells Fargo Advantage Growth .
"
1407,TSCO,"IBD: I know you are bottom-up investors and do not invest based on sectors. Yet sector weights show where you expect to find leaders. Tech is still your largest sector. Through the 12 months ended Sept. 30 your weighting declined 11 percentage points to 24%. Mostly price action, or mostly sells?
"
1408,TSCO,"Olson: Both. When we take out assets, it's to deploy them into better ideas.
"
1409,TSCO,"IBD: Your weightings increased by about 5% in health care and 4% in industrials.
"
1410,TSCO,"Eberhardy: We look at the world bottom-up. When we see that valuation gap widen in names we like, we redeploy our cash.
"
1411,TSCO,"IBD: Akorn (AKRX) is a health name that you added to as of your latest disclosure. Sales have accelerated for two quarters. What's your thesis?
"
1412,TSCO,"Eberhardy: They focus on ophthalmology and hospital injectables, primarily generics. The main thesis is that this is an underappreciated name. The market has missed the fact that they have 27 abbreviated new product applications. That's a big pipeline. It shows what's before the FDA and has a chance to be approved.
"
1413,TSCO,"Those address about a $3 billion branded market. The company also plans to go into the private label ophthalmology market.
"
1414,TSCO,"And there's an underappreciated shortage of generic injectable drugs, due to manufacturing delays at some larger players like Hospira (HSP). So we believe Akorn is a 25% to 30% annual top line grower. It should have expanding margins, so it should get in excess of that on the bottom line.
"
1415,TSCO,"IBD: Zoll Medical (ZOLL) is another health name you added to. Return on equity jumped to 9.3% in 2011 from 6.4% the year before. What do you like here?
"
1416,TSCO,"Eberhardy: They have one main product, the LifeVest. It's a wearable defibrillator, which a patient can use while waiting to get an implantable cardiac defibrillator.
"
1417,TSCO,"There have been rule changes that the waiting period (during which a patient wears LifeVest while his doctor assesses his risk for sudden cardiac arrest and develops a treatment strategy) should be extended, and LifeVest is at the forefront of taking advantage of that.
"
1418,TSCO,"IBD: You added to your stake in Chart Industries (GTLS), an industrial. Sales growth has accelerated for six quarters. Earnings per share have grown at a triple-digit pace for three quarters but are decelerating. Your thoughts?
"
1419,TSCO,"Eberhardy: They're the leading manufacturer of equipment used in processing and storage of industrial gases and liquefied natural gas.
"
1420,TSCO,"There's a secular movement toward more use of LNG. This company is at the forefront of providing infrastructure for that distribution.
"
1421,TSCO,"Also, LNG is being used more as a fuel for transportation overseas.
"
1422,TSCO,"And here in the U.S. there is a big difference between the cost of producing gas and what it can be sold for overseas.
"
1423,TSCO,"IBD: Is Tractor Supply  (TSCO) doing well because it caters to people who ranch and farm more for fun than profit?
"
1424,TSCO,"Ognar: They don't sell to farmers. Their end market is more like the rural enthusiast, who has 10 acres, farms a little, has a horse and enjoys the rural lifestyle.
"
1425,TSCO,"They have an opportunity to double their store base. They're just starting to expand into the Western U.S. They've done a lot of productive things, from better merchandising, better inventory and distribution management — which are resulting in better sales experiences at stores — and (better) profitability and earnings.

1459,TSCO,"In late 2007, Gregory Sandfort, Tractor Supply's president and COO, saw customer buying patterns shifting. Clients of the farm and ranch equipment seller were moving away from buying large-ticket items. They wanted to mend equipment. If consumer buying was changing, Tractor Supply, with 1,135 retail stores in 45 states, needed to respond.
"
1460,TSCO,"It was a smart call for Sandfort, who at the end of September was named Tractor Supply's (TSCO) CEO effective Jan. 1 next year when current CEO James Wright becomes executive chairman of the Brentwood, Tenn.-based chain's board.
"
1461,TSCO,"As president, Sandfort helped managers focus on increasing the ""consumable, usable and edible products"" at company outlets to boost customer traffic. Management also came up with ""CUE"" as an acronym for their new strategy, and so far, it's working.
"
1462,TSCO,"Adapting product lines to shifting customer spending patterns is now critical to a company's success. They also honed their strategy without hiring a costly research firm. Tractor Supply compiles its own research on what customers are buying.
"
1463,TSCO,"Sensitivity on just how much clients are willing to spend is critical at the cash register. ""We sell riding lawn mowers, parts and accessories, so anything that sells for above $350 is considered a big-ticket item,"" Sandfort told IBD.
"
1464,TSCO,"Sandfort, a former chief merchandising officer at Michaels Stores, studies Tractor Supply's business in small chunks to see ""what's selling in spring, what's not, what needs to change. Sequence and timing are critical,"" he said.
"
1465,TSCO,"Sandfort described consumable items as things people use such as fertilizers and lubricants, usables as equipment that needs to be repaired and edibles as feed for pets and farm animals. He calls these CUE items necessary, not discretionary, and comparable to ""milk, eggs and butter"" in a supermarket.

"
1470,TSCO,"For example, when customers started to buy a premium branded dog food that was costing $45 to $48 a package, Tractor Supply saw an opening for a new product. It developed its own premium canine food but sold it for $7 or $8 less, which has proven popular. It keeps its prices down because it doesn't have to pay for marketing, Sandfort says.
"
1471,TSCO,"Most of its stores are located in rural areas, and 60% of those locales suffered droughts in 2012. Tractor Supply stocked more water storage tanks and hoses so customers could store and gain access to water, but cut back on buying lawn mowers. You don't need to cut your grass during a drought, Sandfort says.
"
1472,TSCO,"Adapting product lines is paying off. In 2011, Tractor Supply had an 8.2% increase in same-store sales following a 7% rise in 2010.
"
1473,TSCO,"Store sales are rising because Tractor Supply listens to its customers, says Joan Storms, a Los Angeles-based industry analyst with Wedbush Securities. ""When customers come in, it's like talking to their neighbors. Tractor Supply hires horse specialists and metal repair specialists,"" she said.

"
1476,TSCO,"Tractor Supply has a ""franchise in this farm and tractor category that no one else covers,"" Storms said. While they face competition from PetSmart (PETM) and Petco for some types of feed, most of their rivals are local feed stores, which don't carry its breadth of merchandise.

Volume was tracking lower compared with the same time Tuesday.The broad indexes deepened their losses after the National Association of Realtors reported a 5.5% plunge in pending home sales for April. That was well below even the most optimistic estimates. The SPDR S&P Homebuilders (XHB) ETF was down 2%.Relatively few leading stocks came under heavy fire in early trading. But the retail sector accounted for a large share of those.DSW (DSW) gapped down, shedding 3% in heavy volume. The stock remained above 57, a level of resistance it cleared a week ago. Rival Steven Madden (SHOO) also lost 3% in active trading.Tractor Supply (TSCO) continued its sell-off.

1509,TSCO,"A correction is no time to buy.Most disciplined investors probably aren't having much trouble following that rule these days. The month of May hasn't served up many breakouts.The sluggishness is making it easy for investors to do what they should be doing: looking for stocks that could be forming bases.A few stocks in the Stock Spotlight screen appear to be working on bases. These stocks also have relative strength lines at or near new highs, which points to outperformance vs. the S&P 500.Network management software developer SolarWinds (SWI) gapped up 20% in huge volume to close at 45.38 on April 26. The stock has essentially moved sideways since the gap-up, while the S&P 500 dropped about 7%.On the weekly chart, SolarWinds looks like it is only in the third week of a consolidation.

1513,TSCO,"In Monday's column, IBD noted that the shaky action of certain individual stocks affirmed the market's shift into a correction.However, it should also be noted that not all stocks are following the same script.As Monday's selection of 16 stocks showed, several have fallen minimally since IBD's Market Pulse went from ""uptrend under pressure"" to ""correction"" after the May 4 trading session.The leaders that fall the least during a general decline are sending an important signal to alert chart readers. When the market returns to an uptrend, the chances are greater for these stocks to power out of new bases first and go on strong price runs.Consider Sourcefire (FIRE), which gapped up 13% on May 1 in the second-highest turnover so far this year. That big move catapulted the network security specialist 24% past a 46.39 short-stroke entry. In other words, the stock is still well extended from a proper buy point.Recent declines have been modest, both in price and volume.The company, incorporated in 2001 and making its stock-market debut in March 2007, has accelerating top- and bottom-line growth.SXC Solutions (SXCI) soared 22% in the week ended April 20, while the market was still in rally mode. The fast-growing pharmacy benefits manager has recently announced new acquisitions to further bolster its market presence.Despite a 2.5% decline Monday, the stock is still 9% above its fast-rising 10-week line.Tractor Supply (TSCO), featured in today's Income Investor column on Page B6, is easing in a gentle fashion after rising as much as 44% from a 70.20 cup-with-handle entry. The leader in IBD's Retail/Wholesale-Building Products sports 38% annualized EPS growth in the past three years.

1515,TSCO,"Dividend-paying companies tend to be more mature, less volatile firms. W.W. Grainger (GWW) fits the bill. But the company has also delivered respectable growth.Last month, the industrial supplies retailer reported full-year 2011 adjusted diluted earnings per share of $9.04, up 33%. That marked the fourth straight double-digit gain in the past five years.The stock has a five-year Earnings Stability Factor of 9, indicating a steady stream of profit.Sales grew 12% to nearly $8.1 billion. It has now delivered back-to-back double-digit increases in annual revenue.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters see profit rising 16% to $10.51 this year. The estimate has been raised recently.W.W. Grainger is a member of the S&P Dividend Aristocrats index, which tracks the performance of blue chip companies that have increased their shareholder payouts for at least 25 years.The company has raised its dividend for 40 straight years. W.W. Grainger's dividend has nearly doubled since 2007. In its last dividend hike of almost a year ago, W.W. Grainger boosted its payout by 22% to a quarterly rate of 66 cents a share. It tends to announce dividend increases in late April.On an annualized basis, W.W. Grainger pays $2.64 a share. This works out to a current yield of 1.3%, which is on the low side of the eight dividend-paying stocks in the high-ranking Retail/Wholesale-Building Products group. The group is home to top-rated firms such as  Fastenal (FAST), Home Depot (HD) and Tractor Supply (TSCO).Despite the softer yield, W.W. Grainger has a Composite Rating of 97 and an Earnings Per Share Rating of 91. Both are among the highest of its peers.W.W. Grainger cleared a 156.95 buy point from a cup-with-handle base Sept. 13 in healthy volume. But it triggered the 8% sell rule about three weeks later.The stock staged a comeback after finding support near its 10-week and 40-week moving averages and has been in a sharp uptrend since. It has now formed a three-weeks-tight add-on pattern. The buy point is at 212.10, or 10 cents above the Feb. 28 peak.

"
1642,TSCO,"The company has been on a roll with double-digit sales and earnings gains the past four quarters. In the first quarter reported April 20, earnings popped 85% to 24 cents a share, topping views. Sales grew 18% to $836.6 million. Same-store sales increased 10.7%.
"
1643,TSCO,"""We continue to have strong traffic in our stores,"" Guiler said. ""The primary driver is the continued strength of what we call consumable, usable and edible products.""

"
1645,TSCO,"These categories have performed well over the past few years, says Guiler, and have driven new and current customers into the stores more frequently.
"
1646,TSCO,"To improve business and drive repeated customer visits as the economy turned south in 2008, Tractor Supply shifted gears. It switched its focus from big-ticket discretionary items like riding lawn mowers for $2,000-$5,000 to a bigger mix of lower-priced items people purchase every day.

1807,TSCO,"Think of some of the themes you've found in leaders in the past few years: technology, retail and high-growth economies. A good number of winners thrived on the wave of at least one of these themes, some enjoyed two.MercadoLibre (MELI) sits in the nexus of all three.The Argentina-based company is a sort of Latin American  eBay (EBAY), operating platforms that allow for auction-style sales and virtual stores in a dozen Latin American and Caribbean countries.MercadoLibre facilitates payments in six of these markets with its MercadoPago system, which works a lot like PayPal.This column in Tuesday's edition noted the rash of retailers that led the market's recent uptrend. They included  Lululemon Athletica (LULU), GNC Holdings (GNC), Tractor Supply (TSCO) and Michael Kors (KORS).Each of these retail stars found a niche to help it stand out. After all, if there's one thing we have no shortage of, it's stores.For example, GNC grabs prime retail space to sell its line of high-priced nutrients to the health-conscious workout crowd. Michael Kors has targeted the concept of affordable luxury fashion. And Lululemon Athletica sells its own line of yoga-themed exercise apparel and accessories.These niches are unique.But MercadoLibre, or the vendors that operate on any of its platforms, can sell anything or everything, just like eBay. What's special about everything?We're really looking at the upside of tapping into a fast-growing emerging market.True, introducing an online business in a region where penetration is rising and has room to grow seems like a winning idea.But that seems a normal part of the bigger story. Latin America is largely a fast-growing region. A middle class is emerging in countries such as Brazil (the region's anchor economy, which accounted for 56% of sales last year). Wealth is being created and spent.Nearly 76 million Brazilians were Internet users as of June 2011, according to Internet World Stats. That's 37.4% of the population. The government says the number of Internet users will grow 13.9% this year.Urban unemployment fell to 4.7% in December, an all-time low.And, crucially, per-capita GDP rose to $11,600 in 2011. That's up 2.6% for the year — and 53% in the past decade.The World Bank says Brazil's economy rose 7.5% in 2010. Credit-rating agency Fitch Ratings said in December that Brazil's GDP likely rose 2.8% in 2011.Morgan Stanley thinks growth will rise to 3.5% this year. The central bank is easing after a series of rate hikes. The new posture should help restore consumption and growth, Morgan Stanley said in December.MercadoLibre earned 47 cents per share in Q4 on sales of $86.5 million. Both results missed estimates, which seems to be traced to currency movements.MercadoLibre's chart shows a flat base developing, and a recently formed handle points to a buy point at 103.08.Volume has been light during the five-week correction, which combines with the tight price action to form a sound pattern.

"
1815,TSCO,"An investor learning to spot bullish chart patterns might do well to start with the easiest one: the flat base.As its name implies, a flat base is a shallow price contraction on a chart that forms as a stock digests an earlier advance.Simple enough, right?Of course, nothing in stock investing is quite so simple. Not every sideways consolidation is a flat base. From IBD's decades of studying successful stocks, here's what is known about the proper framework of the flat base:• It needs at least five weeks to form. Shorter patterns are not adequate enough to flush out weak or impatient shareholders.Usually, start counting with the first down week on a weekly chart.• The stock's price declines no more than 15% from its intraday peak to intraday trough. This means that in some cases, the ""flat"" base has kind of a ""U"" shape and doesn't look so flat. Yet, it is still a proper base.• The optimal buy point is determined by finding the highest price in the pattern and adding 10 cents to it.Usually, that highest price is at the start of the correction.But every once in a while, a stock forms a significant resistance area that's a bit lower than the prior high. This can provide an earlier entry point.As with the breakout from other key chart patterns, the stock should clear the buy point in volume at least 40% above its 50-day average.Flat bases tend to form as a second or third base in a stock's major advance, following a double bottom, cup with handle or another, larger base. Rarely, flat bases are the first base.In late 2011 and early 2012, Tractor Supply (TSCO) had all the makings of a good flat base: It had climbed from a cup-with-handle breakout, it corrected 14%, and it consolidated for eight weeks.The buy point was 78.32 (1) but an alternative buy point could be traced at 75.58. (2) The midcap stock broke out above both in heavy trading on Jan. 12, 2012, in volume nearly five times its average. (3)The farming supply chain rallied 29% from the higher buy point until it peaked three months later.When it broke out, Tractor Supply's Earnings Per Share Rating was a solid 94, meaning that its long- and short-term profit growth exceeds 94% of all stocks in IBD's database. Its Relative Price Strength Rating was 92.

1871,TSCO,"Investors with an interest in Retail - Miscellaneous stocks have likely encountered both Office Depot (ODP  -  Free Report) and Tractor Supply (TSCO  -  Free Report). But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now? Let's take a closer look.We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends, while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits.Right now, Office Depot is sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Tractor Supply has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). This means that ODP's earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive, so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook. But this is only part of the picture for value investors.Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.ODP currently has a forward P/E ratio of 8.88, while TSCO has a forward P/E of 18.99. We also note that ODP has a PEG ratio of 0.51. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. TSCO currently has a PEG ratio of 1.43.Another notable valuation metric for ODP is its P/B ratio of 0.73. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, TSCO has a P/B of 7.32.These are just a few of the metrics contributing to ODP's Value grade of A and TSCO's Value grade of C.ODP stands above TSCO thanks to its solid earnings outlook, and based on these valuation figures, we also feel that ODP is the superior value option right now.

1872,TSCO,"Tractor Supply Company (TSCO  -  Free Report) delivered lower-than-expected results in first-quarter 2018. However, both earnings and sales increased year over year. Also, management reiterated its guidance for 2018.Following the soft quarterly results, shares of this leading rural lifestyle retail store chain were down 1.8% in pre-market trading. In the past three months, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has lost 21.4% wider than the industry’s decline of 11%.Q1 HighlightsTractor Supply reported quarterly earnings of 57 cents per share, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. However, the bottom line increased 23.9% year over year backed by its growth initiatives.Also, the company’s revenues increased 7.6% to $1,682.9 million but fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,690 million. This year-over-year growth can be attributed to rise in comparable-store sales (comps), which improved 3.7% against a decline of 2.2% in the year-ago period. While comparable store transaction count grew 3.2%, average ticket inched up 0.5%. Furthermore, traffic and sales growth were aided by the company’s ongoing efforts to build customer loyalty and enhance digital capabilities. Additionally, comps gained from improvement across all geographic regions as well as major product categories.Tractor Supply also witnessed strength in everyday basic products across the consumable, usable and edible categories as well as winter seasonal products. Improvement in comps was somewhat compensated with soft sales across spring and summer seasonal products. Tractor Supply Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Tractor Supply Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Tractor Supply Company QuoteMargins & CostsGross profit rose 8.8% year over year to $563.6 million in the quarter, with gross margin expanding 36 basis points (bps) to 33.5%. The upside was driven by robust sell-through of winter seasonal products, somewhat offset by higher transportation costs due to a rise in carrier rates and diesel fuel expenses.Additionally, selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, including depreciation and amortization, as a percentage of sales, grew 89 bps to 27.9%. This increase can be primarily attributed to investments in team member wages, increased store expenses and investments in infrastructure and technology to support the strategic long-term growth initiatives.Financial PositionTractor Supply ended first quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $132.4 million, long-term debt of $679.6 million and total stockholders’ equity of $1,313.2 million.In the quarter under review, the company repurchased shares for $157.5 million. Additionally, it incurred capital expenditures of $45.1 million and generated cash flow from operating activities of about $21.9 million.Store UpdateIn the first quarter, Tractor Supply opened 15 namesake stores and four Petsense stores.As of Mar 31, 2018, the company operated 1,700 Tractor Supply stores in 49 states and 172 Petsense stores.GuidanceManagement remains impressed with its first-quarter results that witness margin expansions, comps growth and greater sales.

1874,TSCO,"Tractor Supply Company (TSCO  -  Free Report) is slated to release first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 26. Last quarter, the company reported a positive earnings surprise of 4.6%.Moreover, Tractor Supply delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 2.2% in the trailing four quarters. Notably, the company has been witnessing sales and earnings growth for more than two years now. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.What to Expect?The question popping up in investors’ minds is whether Tractor Supply will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first quarter is pegged at 59 cents, reflecting growth of 28.3% year over year. Moreover, earnings estimate for the current quarter has climbed in the last seven days, reflecting a positive momentum ahead of earnings.  Also, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $1.70 billion, up about 8.4% from the year-ago quarter.Tractor Supply Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Tractor Supply Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Tractor Supply Company QuoteFactors at PlayTractor Supply remains focused on store-growth initiatives, ONETractor plan and investment in everyday businesses. Evidently, it remains on track to attain the long-term domestic-store growth target of 2,500 stores. Further, the company is focusing on integrating its physical and digital operations to offer consumers a seamless shopping experience.The company remains on track with its “ONETractor” initiative that is aimed at connecting store and online shopping. In this regard, the company is reaping significant benefits from its Buy Online Pick Up in Store program while it continues to expand its Neighbor’s Club customer rewards program. Management expects both strategies to play a major role in boosting the top line. It also expects long-term results to benefit from its mobile POS and stockyard initiatives.Moreover, the company is benefiting from solid comps, driven by strength across all regions and major product categories, which fueled its fourth-quarter 2017 results.Going into 2018, Tractor Supply expects to balance investments between new-store growth and ONETractor strategic initiative, alongside investing in everyday businesses, to provide a seamless experience to customers. This will provide significant growth opportunities as the company will gain market share and leverage its physical stores while expanding digital capabilities. Consequently, it provided an encouraging guidance for the first quarter and full-year 2018.The company anticipates stronger comps and earnings per share in the first half of the year compared with the second half. Hence, it forecasts comps for the first half at or above 2-3% for 2018 while the second half comps are likely to be below this range.Further, the company revealed that the first quarter will include one extra comp day as its stores were open on New Year’s Day for the first time. This extra day is likely to add about 60-70 bps to comps for the first quarter and 10-15 bps to full-year comps. Additionally, the company projects highest comps growth and lowest operating-margin compression in the first quarter.However, the company expects continued cost pressures from rising freight rates, due to a shortage of drivers and higher diesel prices as well as inflationary wage pressures across retail locations and the supply chain. These headwinds, along with the company’s investments to grow business, are likely to keep operating margin for 2018 under pressure. Consequently, operating margin is anticipated to be nearly 8.8%, the mid-point of the company’s guidance range. Additionally, gross margin is anticipated to be flat to marginally down in 2018, with significant impact on SG&A expense.Further, the shares of Tractor Supply have declined 26.9% in the last three months, wider than the industry’s decline of 12.4%. However, the company’s focus on growth initiatives helped it to outperform the industry in the past year.Given the above iterations, let’s wait and see if the company’s strategic efforts can offset the margin-related constraints.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Tractor Supply is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

Meanwhile, the company continues reaping significant benefits from its Buy Online Pick Up in Store program, besides expanding its Neighbor’s Club customer rewards program. Tractor Supply expects long-term results to benefit from its mobile POS and stockyard initiatives as well. These factors clearly justify Tractor Supply’s commitment toward enhancement of its omni-channel network.Notably, this leading rural lifestyle products’ retailer opened 101 flagship stores in 2017, converted two Hometown Pet Stores to Petsense stores and closed nine Del’s stores. Further, it opened 25 new Petsense stores in the same year, including the aforementioned two conversions.

As of Mar 31, 2018, Tractor Supply operated 1,700 namesake stores across 49 states with an e-commerce website.In 2016, Tractor Supply acquired Petsense LLC — a leading specialty retailer of pet supplies and services — to fortify its presence in the flourishing pet specialty space.

The company revamped itself by concentrating on square footage growth and maximizing productivity from its existing store base. Also, Tractor Supply implemented significant changes in its store operations to make them simpler and customer-friendly.The Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s solid omni-channel efforts are paying off well. In the fourth quarter of 2017, Tractor Supply delivered an impressive performance, backed by solid comparable sales growth from its new stores. However, these efforts are not enough to elevate the company’s shares. In a year’s time, the stock has lost 10.9%, narrower than the industry’s decline of 16.4%. On the flip side, players like KAR Auction Services, Inc. (KAR  -  Free Report), Five Below, Inc. (FIVE  -  Free Report) and Build-A-Bear Workshop, Inc. (BBW  -  Free Report) outperformed the industry in the said time frame. Shares of KAR Auction Services, Five Below and Build-A-Bear Workshop have rallied 30.2%, 69% and 3.5%, respectively.While KAR Auction Services has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), Five Below and Build-A-Bear Workshop carry a Zacks Rank #3.

QuoteWhile gross profit fell 3.5% to $964.8 million, gross profit margin contracted 150 basis points (bps) to 35%.

1878,TSCO,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Tractor Supply Company (TSCO  -  Free Report). Shares have added about 11.3% in that time frame.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is TSCO due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Tractor Supply Misses on Q1 Earnings, Keeps '18 View    Tractor Supply delivered lower-than-expected results in first-quarter 2018. However, both earnings and sales increased year over year. Also, management reiterated its guidance for 2018.Q1 HighlightsTractor Supply reported quarterly earnings of 57 cents per share, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. However, the bottom line increased 23.9% year over year backed by its growth initiatives.Also, the company’s revenues increased 7.6% to $1,682.9 million but fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,690 million. This year-over-year growth can be attributed to rise in comparable-store sales (comps), which improved 3.7% against a decline of 2.2% in the year-ago period. While comparable store transaction count grew 3.2%, average ticket inched up 0.5%. Furthermore, traffic and sales growth were aided by the company’s ongoing efforts to build customer loyalty and enhance digital capabilities. Additionally, comps gained from improvement across all geographic regions as well as major product categories.Tractor Supply also witnessed strength in everyday basic products across the consumable, usable and edible categories as well as winter seasonal products. Improvement in comps was somewhat compensated with soft sales across spring and summer seasonal products.Margins & CostsGross profit rose 8.8% year over year to $563.6 million in the quarter, with gross margin expanding 36 basis points (bps) to 33.5%. The upside was driven by robust sell-through of winter seasonal products, somewhat offset by higher transportation costs due to a rise in carrier rates and diesel fuel expenses.Additionally, selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, including depreciation and amortization, as a percentage of sales, grew 89 bps to 27.9%. This increase can be primarily attributed to investments in team member wages, increased store expenses and investments in infrastructure and technology to support the strategic long-term growth initiatives.Financial PositionTractor Supply ended first quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $132.4 million, long-term debt of $679.6 million and total stockholders’ equity of $1,313.2 million.In the quarter under review, the company repurchased shares for $157.5 million.

Tractor Supply remains optimistic about the spring selling season going ahead. Furthermore, it expects to balance investments between new store growth and ONETractor strategic initiative, alongside investing in everyday businesses to provide a seamless experience to its customers.However, Tractor Supply reiterated its guidance for 2018. The company continues to project net sales in the band of $7.69-$7.77 billion, reflecting 6-7% growth year over year. Comps growth is anticipated in the range of 2-3% for the year. Further, earnings per share are envisioned in the band of $3.95-$4.15.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates.

1879,TSCO,"A smart beta exchange traded fund, the PowerShares Dynamic Building & Construction Portfolio (PKB  -  Free Report) debuted on 10/26/2005, and offers broad exposure to the Industrials ETFs category of the U.S. equity market.What Are Smart Beta ETFs?For a long time now, the ETF industry has been flooded with products based on market capitalization weighted indexes, which are designed to represent the broader market or a particular market segment.Market cap weighted indexes offer a low-cost, convenient, and transparent way of replicating market returns, and are a good option for investors who believe in market efficiency.On the other hand, some investors who believe that it is possible to beat the market by superior stock selection opt to invest in another class of funds that track non-cap weighted strategies--popularly known as smart beta.This kind of index follows this same mindset, as it attempts to pick stocks that have better chances of risk-return performance; non-cap weighted strategies base selection on certain fundamental characteristics, or a mix of such characteristics.While this space offers a number of choices to investors, including simplest equal-weighting, fundamental weighting and volatility/momentum based weighting methodologies, not all these strategies have been able to deliver superior results.Fund Sponsor & IndexThe fund is sponsored by Invesco Powershares. It has amassed assets over $289.70 M, making it one of the average sized ETFs in the Industrials ETFs. Before fees and expenses, PKB seeks to match the performance of the Dynamic Building & Construction Intellidex Index.The index is comprised of stocks of U.S. building and construction companies. The Index is designed to provide capital appreciation by thoroughly evaluating companies based on a variety of investment merit criteria, including fundamental growth, stock valuation, investment timeliness and risk factorsn.Cost & Other ExpensesCost is an important factor in selecting the right ETF, and cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive cousins if all other fundamentals are the same.Annual operating expenses for PKB are 0.63%, which makes it on par with most peer products in the space.It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 0.19%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsWhile ETFs offer diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk, a deep look into a fund's holdings is a valuable exercise. And, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.Representing 43.50% of the portfolio, the fund has heaviest allocation to the Consumer Discretionary sector; Industrials and Materials round out the top three.Taking into account individual holdings, Pultegroup Inc (PHM  -  Free Report) accounts for about 5.52% of the fund's total assets, followed by Tractor Supply Co (TSCO  -  Free Report) and Dr Horton Inc (DHI  -  Free Report).The top 10 holdings account for about 45.75% of total assets under management.Performance and RiskSo far this year, the ETF has lost about -10.18%, and was up about 7.33% in the last one year (as of 05/22/2018). PKB has traded between $28.31 and $36.11 in the past 52-week period.The ETF has a beta of 1.22 and standard deviation of 17.95% for the trailing three-year period, making it a high choice in the space. With about 30 holdings, it has more concentrated exposure than peers.AlternativesPowerShares Dynamic Building & Construction Portfolio is a reasonable option for investors seeking to outperform the Industrials ETFs segment of the market. However, there are other ETFs in the space which investors could consider.SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF (XHB  -  Free Report) tracks S&P Homebuilders Select Industry Index and the iShares U.S. Home Construction ETF (ITB  -  Free Report) tracks Dow Jones U.S. Select Home Construction Index. SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF has $890.20 M in assets, iShares U.S. Home Construction ETF has $1.57 B. XHB has an expense ratio of 0.35% and ITB charges 0.44%.Investors looking for cheaper and lower-risk options should consider traditional market cap weighted ETFs that aim to match the returns of the Industrials ETFs.Bottom LineTo learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.

1880,TSCO,"Benchmarks closed in the green on Wednesday after two straight days of declines. Boeing reached an all-time high after releasing upbeat fourth-quarter earnings results and a strong full-year projection, which in turn boosted key indexes. However, markets lost some of their gains after the Fed’s stated that inflation was likely to reach its desired level in the medium term and projected gradual increase in key rates. Although, key indexes finished marginally higher on the last trading day of January, all of them registered record gains for the month. While, the Dow and the S&P 500 registered their best monthly performance since March 2016, the tech-heavy Nasdaq posted its highest monthly increase since October 2015.How the Benchmarks Fared?The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) increased 0.3%, to close at 26,149.39. The S&P 500 rose 0.1% to close at 2,823.81. The tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index closed at 7,411.48, gaining 0.1%. The fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) decreased 12% to close at 13.01.

On Nasdaq, a 1.61-to-1 ratio favored declining issues.What Moved the Benchmarks?Shares of The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) rose 4.9% settling at its best levels ever, after the aircraft manufacturer posted fourth-quarter earnings per share and revenues that beat the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate. (Read More)For the full year, Boeing’s operating profit jumped 76% year-over-year to $10.3 billion. Net earnings for the company climbed 67% from 2016 to $8.2 billion in 2017.

(Read More)Fed’s Policy Statement in FocusOn Wednesday, the Federal Reserve opted to leave benchmark rates unchanged within the 1.25%-1.5% range. In its two-day Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) policy statement following the meeting ended Jan 31, the Fed indicated that economic activity has increased at a “solid rate” and will continue to grow at a “moderate pace.”Additionally, per the statement, labor market remains strong, while inflation will likely “move up” in 2018 and will reach the desired 2% rate in the “medium term.” The FOMC also said federal funds rate is likely to increase at a “gradual” pace in coming months.Rising rate hike prospects as early as Fed’s next policy meeting in March weighed on investor sentiment and limited some of Wednesday’s gains. Higher rate environment and optimism of steady economic growth and higher inflation weighed on bond prices.Lower bond prices supported the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield, which was at 2.722% on Wednesday, hovering near its highest settlement in almost four years. Also, 2-year yield was at around 2.15%. High treasury yields also weighed on broader equity markets to a certain extent.According to ADP’s (ADP  -  Free Report) private sector payrolls report for January, 234,000 new jobs were created during the month, Further, December’s results were revised downward by 8000 jobs, but still tallied at 242,000.

The passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which permanently slashes corporate tax rates from 35% to 21%, last December contributed to January’s gains. Additionally, in its Beige Book, the Fed provided an encouraging outlook about the U.S. economy, which in turn also boosted investor sentimentMoreover during the month, the Senate gave its consent to pass a short-term spending Bill that ends the recent government shutdown. Additionally, upbeat fourth-quarter earnings season, which include a very strong revenue momentum, an above-average proportion of positive surprises and an unusually positive revisions trend for the current and coming quarters, also contributed to strong market performance.Stocks That Made HeadlinesQualcomm Beats Q1 Earnings and Revenue EstimatesQualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report) reported strong financial results for first-quarter fiscal 2018, with the top and the bottom lines beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate.

1881,TSCO,"Ulta Beauty Inc. (ULTA  -  Free Report) has been gaining from its effective marketing initiatives, loyalty program, sturdy e-commerce business, superb salon operations and strength in prestige cosmetics. Additionally, favorable traffic is driving comparable store sales (comps) growth. The company’s notable growth in e-commerce sales has also helped it stand out amid intense online competition.However, declining margins and stiff competition remain impediments. The company shares have declined 13.6% in the past three months, underperforming the industry’s growth of 19.8%.Let’s delve deeper to analyze the pros and cons of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company stock.Splendid Earnings History & Robust OutlookUlta Beauty has maintained a solid earnings surprise trend having reported 16 straight quarters of earnings beat. Moreover, the company’s top line has surpassed estimates in 15 of the last 16 quarters. Of late, solid top- and bottom-line performances can be attributed to enhanced market share gains and benefits from attractive loyalty program offers. Additionally, the company is witnessing solid growth across all product categories with prestige cosmetics standing out. Further, robust traffic at stores is boosting comps, which improved double-digits in the most recent quarter.Looking ahead, the company expects to deliver comps growth (including e-commerce) in the range of 10-11% for 2017. Meanwhile, it anticipates e-commerce sales growth in a range of 50-60%. Earnings per share are envisioned to grow in the high twenties percentage range.Robust Online and Omni-Channel GrowthUlta Beauty has garnered goodwill in a short span amid stiff competition because of its strategy of striking the right balance between online and physical stores. Also, the company has successfully managed to grow both e-commerce and in-store sales. Evidently, the company registered whopping 62.9% growth in e-commerce sales, which reflects about 370 bps of the total comps growth. The increase in e-commerce sales was driven by traffic growth of 57% and mobile traffic surge of 92%. The omni-channel customers now form nearly 9.1% of the company’s loyalty members compared with 7.5% in the year-ago period.Effective Merchandise InitiativesUlta Beauty’s effective merchandising offerings largely contribute to growth of in-store sales. Notably, the company’s stores are a one stop shop for beauty enthusiasts, featuring prestige and discount beauty brands as well as offering salon products and services all under one roof. Also, the company remains keen on enhancing beauty products offerings and improving store traffic with superior services. In fiscal 2016, the company had added 69 new brands and executed more than 500 prestige brand expansions across new and existing stores.Adding to its portfolio of prestige brands, the beauty retailer also rolled out Estee lauder’s (EL  -  Free Report) most popular MAC brand this year. Ulta plans to expand this to about 120 stores by the end of fiscal 2017.Sturdy Loyalty ProgramUlta Beauty’s loyalty program was one of the major sales drivers in third-quarter fiscal 2017. Buoyed by its excellent marketing and merchandising endeavors and in-store conversions, Ulta Beauty saw 21% growth in Ultamate Rewards members to $26.4 million by the end of October. Moreover, sales per member, average member ticket, retention rates and frequency of shopping remained sturdy in the quarter.Final ThoughtsWhile all seems well, Ulta Beauty witnessed a decline in both gross and operating margins in the fiscal third quarter. Also, the company is exposed to risk in the customer-driven industry as cheaper alternatives may hinder customers’ loyalty for the brand and thus impacting the sale of products under Ulta banner. Nevertheless, we believe the solid initiatives taken by the company will help it to overcome these hindrances.Do Retail-Miscellaneous Stocks Grab Your Attention?

1882,TSCO,"The Clorox Company (CLX  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report its second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Feb 2, before the market opens. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 3.5%.Notably, the company has delivered positive earnings surprise for four trailing quarters, with an average beat of 2.4%.Clorox Company (The) Price and Consensus Clorox Company (The) Price and Consensus | Clorox Company (The) QuoteWhat to Expect?The question lingering in the investors minds’ is that whether this consumer products company will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at $1.22, reflecting a decline of 2.4% year over year. Earnings estimate for the current quarter has been stable in the last 30 days.  Moreover, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $1.43 billion were up about 1.7% from the year-ago quarter.The company’s shares have rallied 13.8% in the past three months, outperforming the industry’s growth of 3%, mainly driven by its 2020 strategy.Factors at PlayClorox is well on track with its 2020 strategy, which is aimed at bolstering growth for the improvement of categories and overall market share. The strategy is meant to be achieved through key accelerators like investment in brands, development of e-commerce, technological advancements, enhancement of growth culture and focus on the 3Ds - desire, decision and delight.Furthermore, the company’s potential is quite visible in its robust outlook, diversified brand portfolio and disciplined capital strategy. In fact, its solid brand portfolio places Clorox well in the challenging environment.Meanwhile, Clorox remains committed toward brand management and improvement in margins through cost saving and productivity initiatives. Also, the company’s Go Lean strategy remains focused on improving margins through operational efficiencies. These strategies are likely to aid in catering to the near-term challenges.However, management has trimmed its guidance for fiscal 2018 due to the Aplicare business divestiture and increase in costs related to the recent hurricanes. It now anticipates sales growth in the 1-3% range as the Aplicare sale is estimated to reduce fiscal-year sales by slightly less than one point. Further, gross margin is projected to be slightly down due to significant cost pressures related to the recent hurricanes. Hurricanes are also likely to impact earnings per share by nearly 10 cents, leading the company to lower EPS view to $5.47-$5.67 per share.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Clorox is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter.

1885,TSCO,"We expect Ralph Lauren Corporation (RL  -  Free Report) to beat expectations when it reports third-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Feb 1. The company posted positive earnings surprise of 4.7% in the last reported quarter.Moreover, the company has delivered positive earnings surprises consistently in the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 11.6%. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.What to Expect?The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether this designer, marketer and distributor of premium lifestyle products will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at $1.84, reflecting year-over-year decline of 1.1%. We note that earnings estimate for the current quarter has trended up in the last seven days. Moreover, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $1.65 billion, down about 3.9% from the year-ago quarter.Ralph Lauren Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Ralph Lauren Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Ralph Lauren Corporation QuoteRalph Lauren has outperformed the industry in the past month, reflecting increased optimism on the stock ahead of the earnings release. The company’s shares have surged 13.8%, compared with industry’s growth of 7.1%.Factors at PlayRalph Lauren has a robust surprise trend with positive earnings surprises delivered in 11 straight quarters. Favorable geographic and channel mix shifts along with lower promotions and reduced product costs have been aiding bottom-line performance. Additionally, results in recent quarters have been gaining from foreign currency tailwinds.The company’s third-quarter and updated fiscal 2018 guidance clearly reflect the gains from recent positive movements in foreign currency rates. The company expects foreign currency to benefit revenue growth by nearly 160-170 basis points (bps) and operating margin by 10-20 bps in the third quarter. Furthermore, it now estimates foreign currency to aid revenue growth by nearly 80 bps, compared with the previous guidance of minimal negative impact. Moreover, foreign currency is now anticipated to have a minimum effect on operating margin, compared with 40-50 bps negative impact predicted earlier.Looking ahead, management remains confident of Ralph Lauren’s performance, based on its efforts related to global brand reorganization, constant infrastructural investments and e-commerce enhancements. Further, the company’s efforts to evolve product and marketing bode well. All these factors make us optimistic about Ralph Lauren’s upcoming results.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model shows that Ralph Lauren is likely to beat earnings estimates because it has the right combination of two key components. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

1886,TSCO,"Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. (BBBY  -  Free Report) has been reeling under persistently sluggish mall traffic. This has significantly impacted the company’s stock performance, which declined significantly year to date.Bed Bath & Beyond’s shares have declined 43.6% year to date, significantly wider than the industry’s fall of 10.3%. Further, the stock has declined 6.7% since third-quarter fiscal 2017 earnings results (reported on Dec 20). Though the company beat on both top and bottom-line estimates in the quarter, earnings declined year over year while sales remained flat. Further, a bleak comparable store sales (comps) and earnings outlook for fiscal 2017 remain concerns. Nonetheless, the company’s transformation plan, shareholder-friendly moves and strategic expansion of stores bode well. That said, let’s analyze the pros and cons of the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company.What’s Troubling Bed Bath & Beyond?Earnings Continue to Decline, Comps Remain SoftThough the company’s top- and bottom-line surpassed estimates in the third quarter, earnings declined year over year. This marked the company’s first earnings and sales beat after two consecutive misses. Though sales gained from prudent marketing spend and increased promotional offerings, this led to higher advertising costs and lower margins which impacted the bottom line. Further, results were hurt by soft comps due to lower average transactions in stores, somewhat mitigated by greater average transaction amount. Comps at stores fell at a low-single digit percentage rate, while comps from customer-facing digital networks improved.Soft FY17 Outlook Mars EstimatesDriven by comps performance so far in the fourth quarter and expectations for the rest of the year, the company issued a bleak comps and earnings outlook for fiscal 2017. It expects comps to decline in the low single-digit percentage range. Further, the company continues to envision fiscal 2017 earnings per share of roughly $3.00, which reflects a decline of more than 30% from the year-ago period.Consequently, the company’s estimates witnessed a downtrend over the last seven days. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2017 moved down by 3 cents and 1 cent, respectively, to $1.38 per share and $3.00 per share. Moreover, estimates for fiscal 2018 moved north by 3 cents to $2.59 per share.Margin Pressures to Persist Bed Bath & Beyond has been grappling with soft gross and operating margins for six quarters now. While the gross margin contracted 180 basis points (bps) in third-quarter fiscal 2017, operating margin dipped 340 bps. Strained margins trend is attributed to higher shipping and coupon expenses as well as rise in SG&A expenses. Further, the company continues to anticipate the gross margin to decline in fiscal 2017, alongside expecting SG&A deleverage on account of higher payroll and payroll-related costs; advertising expenses; restructuring charges associated with store management incurred in the second quarter and expenses related to Hurricane Harvey and Maira.Will Strategic Initiatives Drive Growth?Transformation PlanThe company remains on track with various transformation efforts to become customers’ first preference. Firstly, the company focuses on improving operational efficiency, which includes transformation of information technology group and related business processes to meet consumers’ evolving demand. It has also set up a strategic portfolio management office (SPMO) to allocate resources toward more profitable areas.Secondly, the company is undertaking several customer-centric plans like enriching product assortment and improving services that in turn will continue to boost online sales, driving the company’s growth.Store ExpansionsBed Bath & Beyond is  expanding its store count strategically, while increasing the productivity of existing stores. Evidently, the company targets opening 25 new stores in fiscal 2017, which pertains to all store concepts — including new formats and underpenetrated markets. In the long run, it expects to operate over 1,300 stores across the United States and Canada, and also plans to expand other concepts from coast to coast. Moreover, the company remains focused on expanding, renovating and relocating stores to adapt to the changing market conditions.Capital Allocation: Boosting Omni-channel CapabilitiesBed Bath & Beyond continually reviews and prioritizes its capital needs. The company incurred $264 million as capital expenditure in the nine months of fiscal 2017, and anticipates deploying about $ 350-$400 million in fiscal 2017. Looking ahead, the company expects to allocate more than half of the capital spending planned for 2017 toward technology-related projects, in support of the growing omni-channel capabilities.Do Retail-Miscellaneous Stocks Grab Your Attention?

1887,TSCO,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Tractor Supply Company (TSCO  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Tractor Supply has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 18.8, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 21.5x. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, Tractor Supply’s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years, with the number having decreased rapidly over the past few months.However, the stock’s PE compares unfavorably with the broader industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 14.2. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively overvalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that Tractor Supply has a forward PE  ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 15.7, which is tad higher than the current level. So it is fair to expect an increase in the company’s share price in the near term.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Tractor Supply has a P/S ratio of about 1.1. This is a bit lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.5x right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years. If anything, TSCO is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P/S metric, suggesting some level of undervalued trading—at least compared to historical norms.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Tractor Supply currently has a Value Score of A, putting it into the top 20%  of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes Tractor Supply a solid choice for value investors.What About the Stock Overall?Though Tractor Supply might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of A and a Momentum Score of B. This gives TSCO a Zacks VGM score — or its overarching fundamental grade — of A. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have upbeat. The current quarter has seen three estimates go higher in the past sixty days, while the full year estimate has seen eight up and three down in the same time period.This has had just a small impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has risen by 9.4% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has surged by 7.4%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Tractor Supply Company Price and Consensus Tractor Supply Company Price and Consensus | Tractor Supply Company QuoteThe stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineTractor Supply is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Further, a strong industry rank (among Top 20% of more than 250 industries) instills investor confidence.However, with a Zacks Rank #3, it is hard to get too excited about this company overall.

Moreover, the company’s top and bottom line outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in fourth-quarter 2017, marking its second consecutive earnings and sales beat. Results were driven by solid sales and comparable store sales (comps) growth.Consequently, the stock has rallied 22.9% in the past six months outperforming the industry’s gain of 5.3%. Let’s analyze the factors driving this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock’s performance.Robust Store Growth InitiativesTractor Supply looks well poised to gain from its store growth initiatives, which include store base expansion and incorporation of technological advancements to induce traffic and drive the top line.

Incidentally, the company remains on track with its ONETractor initiative that is aimed at connecting store and online shopping.

Both of these programs are expected to boost the company’s top line.Also, the company expects long-term results to benefit from its mobile POS and stockyard initiatives. Clearly, these endeavors enhance the company’s omni-channel network along with enriching customers’ experience.Inventory Management: An Effective ToolTractor Supply remains committed toward managing its inventories efficiently over the years.

1889,TSCO,"Hibbett Sports Inc. (HIBB  -  Free Report) has been putting up a good show lately driven by robust earnings trend, growth of omni-channel capabilities, improved Rewards members, small market strategy and inventory management initiatives.The cumulative effect of the company’s strategies and strong third-quarter fiscal 2018 is visible in its stock performance. Notably, the stock has gained 46.7% in the past three months, outperforming the industry’s growth of 4.7%. Additionally, the stock has improved 41.8% since reporting third-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Nov 17.This has helped the stock improve significantly, and attain a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and a VGM Score of A. That said, let’s find out the reasons behind the stock’s upsurge.Robust Surprise TrendMuch of the recent momentum in Hibbett’s stock price can be attributed to robust earnings trend in recent quarters and a splendid performance in third-quarter fiscal 2018. The company retained positive earnings momentum in the fiscal third quarter, which marked its third straight bottom-line beat. Moreover, the company reversed its trend of having missed sales estimates in nine of the past 10 quarters. Results were driven by improvement in the company’s footwear and apparel businesses, alongside strong e-commerce sales, which now accounts for nearly 5% of total sales.Hibbett Sports, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Hibbett Sports, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Hibbett Sports, Inc. QuoteEncouraging Outlook Drives EstimatesFollowing the robust quarter, the company substantially raised guidance for fiscal 2018. The company now envisions earnings for fiscal 2018 in the range of $1.42-$1.50 per share, up significantly from the previous forecast of $1.25-$1.35.Consequently, the company’s estimates witnessed an uptrend in the last 30 days. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth quarter and fiscal 2018 moved up by 2 cents each to 27 cents per share and $1.44 per share, respectively.Growth Initiatives Bode WellWhile the external environment remains challenging, Hibbett is encouraged by the progress it is making on internal initiatives, including the launch of new e-commerce site and re-launch of loyalty program. The company observes that initial results from the website launch have exceeded expectations, while the new loyalty program has been well received by customers. E-commerce contributed 5% to net sales in fiscal third-quarter benefiting from the company’s early marketing plan and strong conversion from online traffic.Additionally, its ongoing marketing initiatives boosted sales by improving traffic and increased loyalty members, while also enhancing site navigation strength and product assortments. Rewards jumped to 57% of net sales in fiscal third-quarter, compared with 47% last year. Further, revenues from Rewards members improved 24% year over year. Going forward, the company anticipates its small market strategy along with the growth of omni-channel capabilities to enrich customers' experience, consequently positioning Hibbett well for long-term growth.Store Expansion & Inventory Management StrategiesHibbett is gaining from small market strategy as it continues to strengthen presence across the country. The company targets expansion in markets where it is needed and which offer increased potential for future growth. The company reiterated target of growing to over 1,500 stores in undeserved markets. In third-quarter fiscal 2018, Hibbett introduced 13 new stores, expanded one high-performing store and shut down 11 underperforming ones. With this, the company operated 1,082 stores in 35 states as of Oct 28, 2017.Additionally, the company is stringently working on inventory management initiatives despite a challenging environment. Overall, total inventory declined 9.2% from last year and 10.5% on per store basis at the end of fiscal third-quarter.Possible Deterrents – Strained MarginsThough the company’s fundamentals look strong, it has been witnessing strained margins for quite a while now. The company’s margins continue to be under pressure due to increased promotions and markdowns to maintain lower inventory levels, along with higher freight and SG&A expenses. In third-quarter fiscal 2018, the company’s gross margin marked the fifth straight decline, while operating margins contracted for the fourth quarter in a row.Looking ahead, we expect the margins to remain under pressure given the persistence of a highly promotion retail environment during the holiday season.Looking for Some Trending Picks?

The company stated that it had incurred $329 million in costs due to problems associated with production of its KC-46 aerial refueling tanker.

(Read More)Trump Keeps Investors on TenterhooksAmidst much speculation regarding who will go on to head the Fed, investors eagerly wait for President Trump’s decision to choose Janet Yellen’s successor, post the expiration of her term as the Fed Chief in February, 2018. In a surprising move, Trump sought help of the Senate Republicans on Tuesday to zero in on a potential candidate for the post of Fed Chief. In a show-of-hands, Senators from the GOP unanimously vouched for Stanford University Professor John Taylor to be the next Chief of Fed. Trump would reportedly announce the name of Yellen’s successor officially before he heads out on a trip to Asia. Some experts commented that ‘show-of-hands’ might possibly be a decisive factor affecting Trump’s decision.Meanwhile, broader markets gained from positive investor sentiment due to hopes that the existing tax code would soon be amended. The green signal to the budget blueprint ensures taxpayers that existing tax codes would be rewritten, more so because it has unlocked a procedure using which President Trump and his team can push through their tax reforms using only Republican votes.Economic DataOn the economic data front, new home sales surged to 667,000 in September, up from 561,000 in August — an increase of 18.9% from the previous figure.

1891,TSCO,"Leading retail farm and ranch store chain in the United States, Tractor Supply Company (TSCO  -  Free Report) has been facing a challenging economic backdrop at the agricultural and energy sectors for quite some time. Evidently, the company has delivered unsatisfactory performance in the first half of 2017.Let’s Delve DeepWe note that the company has witnessed negative earnings surprise of 1.6% in the second quarter of 2017, after in-line earnings in the previous quarter. Also, its top line has missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the most recent quarter. Though comparable-store sales (comps) increased 2.2% in the second quarter, comps growth was hurt to an extent of about 60 basis points (bps) due to lesser sales days this quarter compared with second-quarter 2016.Additionally, the company’s margins have remained under pressure, largely on account of higher freight expenses. Consequently, gross margin decreased 60 basis points (bps) and 10 bps in the first and second quarters of 2017, respectively. Going forward, gross margin is anticipated to be flat to down in 2017. Also, operating margin is expected to decline in the band of 80 – 100 bps.Markedly, management has stated that it witnessed favorable trends in early third quarter, given the continued solid demand for spring season products, thanks to favorable weather. Despite this, the company lowered its full-year 207 outlook owing to an unimpressive first-half performance. Thus, net sales are anticipated in a band of $7.13–$7.19 billion compared with $7.22–$7.29 billion, projected earlier.Further, comps growth is now guided in a range of 1.1–1.7%, down from the previously guided range of 2–3% growth. The updated comps view includes a negative impact of about 30% from deflation. Moreover, earnings per share are envisioned in a band of $3.22–$3.27 compared with its old forecast of $3.44–$3.52.Will Tractor Supply’s Initiatives Revive Performance?Tractor Supply’s growth initiatives including expansion of store base and incorporation of technological advancements to improve traffic and drive top line are noteworthy. In fact, the company leverages an extensive network of stores to penetrate into target markets, which in turn, enables it to generate healthy sales and gain market share. Also, it remains on track to attain its long-term domestic store growth target of 2,500 stores.Tractor Supply, which shares space with Five Below, Inc. (FIVE  -  Free Report), KAR Auction Services, Inc. (KAR  -  Free Report) and Sally Beauty Holdings, Inc. (SBH  -  Free Report) remains focused on integrating its physical and digital operations to offer consumers a seamless shopping experience as well. In sync with this the company remains on track with its One Tractor initiative, which is aimed at connecting store and online shopping.Though the company’s initiatives might spark a turnaround, it might take some time.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

1892,TSCO,"Tractor Supply Company (TSCO  -  Free Report) delivered better-than-expected results in fourth-quarter 2017, wherein both the top and bottom line topped estimates and surged year over year. Further, the company provided initial guidance for 2018.Shares of this farm and ranch store retailer have increased 27.8% in the last three months, outperforming the industry’s growth of 17.1%. The upside can be mainly attributed to growth initiatives.Q4 HighlightsTractor Supply posted earnings of 91 cents per share that outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 87 cents, alongside increasing 3.2% year over year.Tractor Supply Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Tractor Supply Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Tractor Supply Company QuoteThe company’s top-line advanced 1.9% to $1,952.8 million and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,947.4 million. Sales for the quarter included a nearly 6.7 percentage point negative impact due to an additional 53rd week in the prior-year quarter. Comparable-store sales (comps) improved 4%, compared with an increase of 3.1% in the year-ago period. On adjusting the 53rd week in 2016, comps would have increased 3.6% in the prior-year quarter.Comps gained from increases in both comparable store transaction count and average ticket. Comparable store transaction count grew 2.7% and average ticket rose 1.3%. Further, traffic and sales growth were aided by the company’s ongoing efforts to build customer loyalty and enhance digital capabilities. Additionally, comps gained from improvement across all geographic regions as well as major product categories. During the quarter, the company witnessed strength in everyday basic products across the consumable, usable and edible categories as well as winter and other seasonal products.Margins & CostsGross profit rose 3.5% year over year to $668.6 million with gross margin expanding 50 basis points (bps) to 34.2%. The upside was driven by lesser promotional activities and improved sell-through rates for seasonal products, somewhat offset by higher mix of freight intensive products and increased transportation costs due to a rise in carrier rates and diesel fuel expenses.Additionally, selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, including depreciation and amortization, as a percentage of sales, grew 120 bps to 24.8%. This increase was primarily due to higher occupancy and other fixed costs, greater incentive compensation, increased store payroll expenses and investments in infrastructure and technology to support the strategic long-term growth initiatives.Financial PositionTractor Supply ended 2017 with cash and cash equivalents of $109.1 million, long-term debt of $401.1 million and total stockholders’ equity of $1,418.7 million.The company repurchased 694,000 shares for $42.8 million in the quarter. With this, Tractor Supply bought back about 5.9 million shares for $369 million in 2017. The company had $870 million remaining under its current share repurchase authorization at the end of 2017. In all, the company returned about $503.2 million of capital to shareholders in 2017 through share buybacks and dividend payments.In 2017, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company incurred capital expenditures of $250 million, of which nearly 40% was spent for maintenance and the remaining 60% was slated for growth-oriented projects including new stores, investments to enhance digital capabilities and developing supply chain infrastructure. Further, it generated cash flow from operating activities of about $631.5 million.Going forward, management expects capital expenditures of $260-$300 million in 2018, directed toward construction costs related to a new distribution center, ONETractor investments and new store growth. Nearly 75% of this spending will be allocated towards initiatives to support long-term growth. Moreover, it anticipates share repurchases for the year to be at the high-end of its target to reduce share outstanding by 2.5-3.5%.Store UpdateDuring the fourth quarter, Tractor Supply opened 27 namesake stores and closed seven Del’s store. Also, it opened six new Petsense stores. In 2017, the company has opened a total of 101 namesake stores, converted two Hometown Pet Stores to Petsense stores and closed nine Del’s stores. Further, it opened 25 new Petsense stores in the year, including the aforementioned two conversions. This marks comfortably reaching its target of opening 100 flagship stores and 25 Petsense stores in 2017.As of Dec 30, 2017, the company operated 1,685 Tractor Supply stores in 49 states and 168 Petsense stores across 26 states.GuidanceGoing into 2018, Tractor Supply expects to balance investments between new store growth and ONETractor strategic initiative, alongside investing in everyday businesses to provide a seamless experience to customers. This will provide significant growth opportunities as the company will gain market share and leverage its physical stores and grow digital capabilities.Further, the company provided guidance for the first quarter and full-year 2018. The company projects net sales in the band of $7.69-$7.77 billion reflecting 6-7% growth year over year. Comps growth is anticipated in a range of 2-3%.Coming to costs and margins, the company anticipates continued cost pressures from rising freight rates due to a shortage of drivers and higher diesel fuel prices, as well as inflationary wage pressures across retail locations and the supply chain. Further, the company is working to strike a balance between initiatives and investments in stores and distribution centers with strict cost disciplines and operational efficiencies.The company’s investments to grow business and the aforementioned headwinds are likely to keep operating margin for 2018 under pressure. Consequently, operating margin is anticipated to be nearly 8.8%, the mid-point of the company’s guidance range. Higher freight costs, wage investments for employees at stores and distribution centers, pre-opening expenses and incremental operating expenses to ramp up a new distribution center in Upstate New York are among some factors that are expected to impact operating margin in 2018.The company expects distribution center costs to impact results in the second half of 2018, particularly the fourth quarter. Gross margin is anticipated to be flat to marginally down in 2018, with significant impact on SG&A expense.Consequently, Tractor Supply envisions earnings per share in a band of $3.95-$4.15. Moreover, the company anticipates stronger comps and earnings per share in the first half of the year compared with the second half. Hence, the company forecasts comps for the first half at or above the guidance range for 2018, while the second half comps are likely to be below the range.Further, the company revealed that the first quarter will include one extra comp day as its stores were open for the first time on New Year’s Day. This extra day is likely to add about 60-70 bps to comps for the first quarter and 10-15 bps to full year comps. Additionally, the company projects highest comps growth and lowest operating margin compression in the first quarter.Moreover, the company expects the recent Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, enacted in December 2017, to aid effective tax rate. Effective tax rate for 2018 is expected to be in the range of 23-23.5% for 2018, significantly below the current rate of nearly 36.7%.Interested in Retail?

The company delivered positive earnings surprise of 5.9% in the last reported quarter.Further, the company has posted positive surprise in two of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 1.6%. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.What to Expect?The questions popping up in the investors minds’ is that whether Tractor Supply will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth quarter is pegged at 87 cents, reflecting a decline of 7.5% year over year. Moreover, earnings estimate for the current quarter has climbed in the last 30 days.  Also, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $1.95 billion, up about 1.6% from the year-ago quarter.Tractor Supply has outperformed the industry in the past month, reflecting increased optimism on the stock ahead of the earnings release. The company’s shares improved 8.8% in the past month compared with the industry growth of 6%. Moreover, the stock has displayed a solid growth of 39.9% in the last three months mainly driven by its focus on store growth initiatives.Tractor Supply Company Price and Consensus Tractor Supply Company Price and Consensus | Tractor Supply Company QuoteFactors at PlayTractor Supply is well on track with its growth initiatives, which include expansion of store base and incorporation of technological advancements to induce traffic and drive the top line. It leverages an extensive network of stores to penetrate into target markets, which in turn, enables the company to generate healthy sales and gain market share. Meanwhile, the company remains on track with its target of opening about 100 Tractor Supply stores and 25 Petsense stores in 2017. It is also likely to reach its long-term domestic store growth target of 2,500 stores.Additionally, the company’s efforts to integrate physical and digital operations through its Tractor One initiative, is reaping returns for stockholders. The company is poised to gain particularly from its Buy Online Pick Up in Store program while it continues to expand the Neighbor’s Club customer rewards program.Furthermore, its expansion into the flourishing pet specialty business with the acquisition of Petsense is a welcome move. This buyout opens up doors to tap the roughly $60 billion pet market.Markedly, these efforts have been driving the company’s top- and bottom-line growth for more than two years and are likely to aid future results as well.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model shows that Tractor Supply is likely to beat earnings estimates because it has the right combination of two key components. A stock needs to have both — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — for this to happen.Tractor Supply has an Earnings ESP of +0.92% as the Most Accurate Estimate of 88 cents is pegged above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 87 cents.

"
1897,TSCO,"After missing both earnings and sales estimates in the second quarter of 2017, Tractor Supply Company (TSCO  -  Free Report) reported better-than-expected results in the third quarter. Also, the company’s top and bottom lines increased year over year. Consequently, management raised its outlook for 2017.However, shares of this Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) company declined 2.5% in the after-market trading session. Furthermore, shares of this farm and ranch store retailer have plunged 23.6% year to date, wider than the industry’s decline of 20.4%. The downturn can be mainly due to the company’s unsatisfactory first-half 2017 performance.Q3 HighlightsTractor Supply posted earnings of 72 cents per share that outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 68 cents, alongside increasing 7.5% year over year. This was driven by higher sales and gross profits.Moreover, the top line advanced 11.6% to $1,721.7 million and also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,683 million. Comparable-store sales (comps) improved 6.6%, as against a 0.6% drop witnessed in the year-ago period. On adjusting the 53rd week in 2016, comps would have decreased 1.1% in the prior-year quarter.The rise in comps was backed by 5% growth in comparable store transaction count and 1.5% increase in average ticket. Further, comps growth was fueled by improvement across all geographic regions as well as major product groups. This also includes robust performance in year-round, seasonal along with emergency response related areas.Margins & CostsGross profit rose 12.2% year over year to $600.5 million with gross margin expanding 20 basis points (bps) to 34.9%. The upside was driven by positive seasonal conditions, disciplined inventory management as well as robust sell through rates, somewhat mitigated by higher mix of freight intensive categories and average fuel expenses.Additionally, selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, including depreciation and amortization, as a percentage of sales, grew 80 bps to 26.3%. This improvement was primarily owing to greater incentive compensation from robust comps growth year over year, store payroll expenses as well as Petsense integration costs. These were partly offset by leverage in occupancy coupled comps growth and cost-savings initiatives.Furthermore, Tractor Supply made investments in infrastructure and technology in order to attain its strategic long-term growth targets.Consequently, operating income margin contracted 60 bps to 8.6% in the quarter under review. Nonetheless, operating income, in dollar terms, rose 4.4% to $148.3 million.Financial PositionTractor Supply ended the third quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $70 million, long-term debt of $487.2 million and total stockholders’ equity of $1,371.4 million.The company repurchased 1.4 million shares for $78.5 million in the quarter. With this, Tractor Supply bought back 5.2 million shares for $326.6 million on a year-to-date basis. Further, the company incurred capital expenditures of $152 million in the nine months of 2017 while it generated cash flow from operating activities of about $340.9 million.Going forward, management expects capital expenditures of $230-$250 million in 2017 versus $250-$270 million, projected earlier.Store UpdateDuring the third quarter, Tractor Supply opened 36 namesake stores and closed one Del’s store. Also, it opened two Petsense stores.Overall, the company inaugurated 74 namesake stores, closed two Del’s stores and converted two Hometown Pet stores to Petsense stores in the nine months of 2017. During this time frame, Tractor Supply opened 19 Petsense outlets (including the aforementioned conversions) as well. Meanwhile, Tractor Supply remains well on track to attain its target of opening 100 flagship stores and 25 Petsense stores in the current year.As of Sep 30, 2017, the company operated 1,665 Tractor Supply stores in 49 states and 162 Petsense stores across 26 states.GuidanceTractor Supply has started witnessing higher demand for cold weather seasonal products in the cold-weather regions, unlike the areas where the weather is warm. Therefore, management believes that it is well placed to benefit from the fall and winter season in the fourth quarter.Tractor Supply Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Tractor Supply Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Tractor Supply Company QuoteBased on the current trends and solid quarterly results, management raised its guidance for 2017. The company now projects net sales in a band of $7.17-$7.22 billion compared with $7.13-$7.19 billion, expected earlier. Comps growth is also guided in a range of 1.7-2.2%, down from the previously guided range of 1.1-1.7% growth. However, Tractor Supply anticipates deflation in the final quarter and 2017 to be about 30 bps.Gross margin is anticipated to be flat to marginally down in the fourth quarter, owing to the adverse product mix and transportation expenses. Further, operating margin is expected to decline by 70-90 bps.Also, Tractor Supply envisions earnings per share in a band of $3.25-$3.29 compared with its old forecast of $3.22–$3.27. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 is currently pegged at $3.25.Interested in Retail?

1898,TSCO,"This week I want to talk about the item Return on Equity.  
"
1899,TSCO,"Return on Equity, or ROE, is a commonly-used measure of management efficiency. It's a favorite screening criteria of many money managers and investors, including myself, because it tells you how successful a company is at using its shareholders' capital.  
"
1900,TSCO,"Moreover, companies with steadily-increasing ROEs are generally better managed with attention being paid to the details. Criteria Defined 
"
1901,TSCO,"Return on Equity shows how much profit a company is making on its shareholder equity (which includes reinvested earnings).  
"
1902,TSCO,"The formula for ROE is calculated as: Income / Average Shareholders Equity (past 12 months)
"
1903,TSCO,"The Income number for a company is listed on their Income Statement. Shareholders Equity is the difference between Total Assets and Total Liabilities and is found on a company's Balance Sheet.  
"
1904,TSCO,"ROE is always expressed as a percentage. So a company with a ROE of 10%, for example, means it created 10 cents of assets for every one dollar of shareholder equity in a given year. How to Use
"
1905,TSCO,"I think ROE is a great item to use regardless of what kind of investor you are  whether it be Growth & Income or Value or even Aggressive Growth or Momentum. Seeing how a company makes use of its equity and the return it makes on it are important measures to look at.  
"
1906,TSCO,"It can also alert you to problems when it's falling.  
"
1907,TSCO,"Another great way to use the ROE is to compare it to its Industry.  
"
1908,TSCO,"Some industries require greater assets than others to run their business. For example, take the Retail Industry versus the Steel Industry. (Retail has a median ROE of 11.8% while the Steel Industry has a median ROE of 5.8%.)  
"
1909,TSCO,"If you screened for only absolute numbers, you may miss some great stocks in some great groups.  
"
1910,TSCO,"So trying to find companies with the best ROEs relative to their group (Sector or Industry etc.) is one of the best ways of making an apples-to-apples comparison in an effort to find the top stocks. Conclusion 
"
1911,TSCO,"ROE can be a powerful screening criteria for investors in measuring how effective management has become and how profitable they are in using investors' cash.  
"
1912,TSCO,"And a better understanding of the factors that affect ROE and how to best use it will help make this criteria even more valuable to you.  
"
1913,TSCO,"The screen I'm running this week has me looking for companies with: ROE greater than or equal to 5 Year Avg. ROEROE greater than or equal to Median for their IndustryZacks Rank equal to 1 (Strong Buys)
"
1914,TSCO,"Here are 5 stocks from this week's screen (for 8/11/10):

1947,TSCO,"We expect Colgate-Palmolive Company (CL  -  Free Report) to beat expectations when it reports fourth-quarter 2017 results on Jan 26.The company has posted in-line earnings in three of the trailing four quarters. Moreover, the company beat its nearly four-year long trend of missing Zacks Consensus Estimate in the previous quarter. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.What to Expect?The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether this consumer goods behemoth will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at 75 cents, which is in line with the year-ago period figure. Also, the earnings estimate has been stable over the last 30 days. Notably, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $3,921 million, up 5.4% from the year-ago quarter.Colgate-Palmolive Company Price and EPS Surprise Colgate-Palmolive Company Price and EPS Surprise | Colgate-Palmolive Company QuoteColgate has outperformed the industry in the past month, reflecting optimism building on the stock recently. The company’s shares have surged 3.1%, compared with industry’s growth of 1%.Factors Driving this QuarterColgate is encouraged by the progress on the Global Growth and Efficiency Program along with additional savings anticipated from the recent expansion of the program. The company’s board on Oct 26 approved an expansion and extension of the program through Dec 31, 2019. This will enable the company to take advantage of the incremental opportunities in the process of streamlining operations. Additionally, it expects after-tax savings from the program to increase to $500-$575 million, compared with $425-$475 million estimated earlier. The projected savings target a three to four year average cash payback, with an after-tax rate of return above 30%.Moreover, innovation and in-store implementation have been the guiding principles for Colgate’s growth strategy over the years, enabling it to capture market share across all regions and categories. The company is coming up with Naturals, an innovation to counter local toothpaste brands, particularly in Asia and Eurasia. It has managed to tailor the Naturals offerings in each of its major markets. For example, the brand will be interpreted differently in India and China. Moreover, the company anticipates growing market share in 2017 via a series of innovative product launches lined up for the year.However, the company’s margins continue to be strained due to increased raw material and packaging costs, as well as higher advertising expenses. Further, it anticipates these costs to persist and impact margins in 2017. Additionally, management has perked up costs guidance related to charges arising from the expansion and extension of the Global Growth and Efficiency Program.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model shows that Colgate is likely to beat earnings estimates because it has the right combination of two key components. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. The company has an Earnings ESP of +0.13%. This along with the company’s Zacks Rank #3 makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.

Last quarter, the company reported a negative earnings surprise of 1.8%.In fact, Whirlpool has missed estimates in the last four quarters, with an average negative earnings surprise of 4.8%. Notably, third-quarter 2017 marked the company’s fifth straight quarter of negative earnings surprise and second consecutive quarter of sales lag. The primary concern for the company in recent quarters has been raw material cost inflation and unfavorable price/mix. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.What to Expect?The question lingering in investors’ minds now is whether Whirlpool will be able to post positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is $4.01, reflecting a year-over-year decline of 7.4%. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has been stable ahead of the earnings release.

However, this compares better than the industry’s 26.1% downside.Factors at PlayWhirlpool’s aforementioned dismal surprise trend has been a concern for investors. The company is clearly grappling with adverse product price/mix and raw material cost inflation has been denting the  operating margin for the last few quarters. Moreover, the company anticipates higher raw material prices to persist through 2018. This has resulted in a lowered earnings view for 2017.The company now envisions adjusted earnings per share for 2017 in a range of $13.60-$13.90 compared with $14.50-$15.00, guided earlier. On a GAAP basis, Whirlpool anticipates earnings in a range of $11.10-$11.40 per share compared with the previous estimate of $12.40-$12.90 for 2017.Further, we believe that volatility in commodity prices, particularly steel, may adversely affect the company’s operating performance. Additionally, Whirlpool derives a significant portion of revenues from international operations, which exposes it to risks in global market. Whirlpool’s customer concentration is also high which is likely to hurt the margins.However, Whirlpool’s robust product pipeline, solid innovations and cost productivity initiatives keep it on track to deliver long-term goals. It aims to deliver organic revenue growth of 3-5% every year through 2020. Further, it anticipates growth efforts to boost consumer demand and lead to enhanced price mix, which encouraged management to target EBIT margin to exceed 10% by 2020.Moreover, Whirlpool has been riding on innovation strategy that helps it to tap additional sales and gain market share. Further, the company is striving to improve margins through a series of measures including cost-based price increments and cost-reduction initiatives focused on enriching business efficiency.That said, let’s wait and see if the company’s strategic efforts can turnaround the aforementioned near-term challenges.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Whirlpool is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

1949,TSCO,"Tractor Supply Company (TSCO  -  Free Report) has been gaining from its store growth initiatives, omni-channel strategies, solid earnings and sales growth trend, and effective inventory management. Further, the recent Petsense acquisition is likely to bolster the company’s presence in the pet specialty space, which is a growing market.These factors helped the stock gain 18.9% in the last three months, surpassing the industry’s 4% growth. Also, the company has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and a long-term earnings growth rate of 14%.Let’s discuss the initiatives taken by the company to induce long-term growth.Sturdy Store Growth InitiativesTractor Supply is on track with its growth initiatives including expansion of store base and incorporation of technological advancements to induce traffic and drive sales. Additionally, the company leverages an extensive network of stores to penetrate into target markets, which in turn enables it to generate healthy sales and gain market share. Evidently, the company is planning to achieve its long-term domestic store growth target of 2,500 stores.Omni-Channel Capabilities to Drive SalesTractor Supply is keen on synchronizing its physical and digital operations to provide a seamless shopping experience to its customers. This is clear from progress on its One Tractor initiative, which focuses on connecting stores and online shopping. Of late, the company also initiated Buy Online Pick Up in Store program that has been successful in contributing nearly 75% to online sales in the third quarter. Meanwhile, Tractor Supply continues to expand its Neighbor’s Club customer rewards program. Both these initiatives are expected to boost the top line. The company expects long-term results to benefit from its mobile POS and stockyard initiatives as well.Inventory Management — A Key ToolTractor Supply has been stringently focusing on managing inventories to minimize effect of weather on its results and capitalize on seasonal demand. In fact, the key focus here has been enhancement of IT systems and supply chain. Additionally, it has been investing in various new systems including demand planning, improved pricing, inventory allocation, all of which are directed toward generating supply chain efficiencies in order to better manage global inventories.Furthermore, the company remains focused on the execution of its digital priorities lending support needed to bolster growth at merchandising, customer facing and logistics capabilities. In this regard, Tractor Supply expects to complete the construction of its planned New York distribution center by the third quarter of 2018.Petsense Acquisition a Boon to Pet BusinessTractor Supply is progressing well with the integration of the recently acquired Petsense LLC, which has opened its doors to the roughly $60 billion pet market. Notably, this acquisition complements its existing pet business operating under the HomeTown Pet Stores banner. As part of the integration, the company successfully converted its two HomeTown Pet stores to Petsense in the first quarter.In addition, the company is on schedule to launch a premium dog and cat food brand — True Source — in its Petsense stores. Tractor Supply also intends to launch an e-commerce site for Petsense toward the end of the fourth quarter with the Buy Online Pick Up in Store facility expected in spring 2018.Compelling Earnings & Sales Growth Trend, Strong Outlook Tractor Supply has a notable record of delivering earnings and sales growth for more than two years now. Following a miss in the second quarter, the company’s top- and bottom-line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in third-quarter 2017 backed by solid comparable store sales (comps) growth and effective inventory management. Comps were driven by strength across all regions and major product categories. Further, the top line was fueled by sales of emergency response products.For the fourth quarter, the company remains well-positioned to drive growth owing to increased demand for cold weather products. Backed by these trends, management raised its earnings and sales outlook for 2017.Bottom LineDespite the above-mentioned tailwinds, deflation remains a concern for Tractor Supply, which is likely to linger in 2017. Furthermore, management expects SG&A expenses deleverage in the fourth quarter. The headwinds related to unfavorable product mix and elevated transport costs are also likely to dent gross margin this year.Nevertheless, the company is poised for long-term growth driven by its inherent strength and growth initiatives.Do Retail-Wholesale Stocks Grab Your Attention?

1950,TSCO,"About a month has gone by since the last earnings report for Tractor Supply Company (TSCO  -  Free Report). Shares have added about 10.4% in that time frame, outperforming the market.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to the next earnings release, or is it due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Tractor Supply Misses on Q2 Earnings, Cuts Outlook Tractor Supply reported second-quarter 2017 results, wherein the company’s earnings of $1.25 per share were below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.27, but it increased 7.8% year over year.The top line advanced 8.9% to $2,017.8 million, while it missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,020.7 million. Comps improved 2.2%, against a 0.5% drop witnessed in the year-ago period. Well, comps growth was hurt to an extent of about 60 basis points (bps) due to lesser sales days this quarter, as compared to second-quarter 2016.The rise in comps was backed by 2.2% growth in comparable transaction count, while average ticket remained flat year over year. Further, comps growth was fueled by improvement in several product categories, with Livestock and Pet topping the list. Also, transaction count growth across all geographic regions contributed to comps.Margins & CostsThe gross profit rose 8.5% year over year to $704.7 million, while gross margin declined 10 bps to 34.9%. The Gross margin was hampered by greater freight costs, stemming from higher diesel fuel prices as well as mix shift toward products that are more freight intensive.Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, including depreciation and amortization, as a percentage of sales, increased 50 bps to 22.1%. This increase was primarily due to increased payroll expenses, infrastructural and technological investments and costs related to Petsense integration. In dollar terms, SG&A expenses (including depreciation and amortization) escalated 11.7% to $446.8 million.Consequently, operating income margin contracted 60 bps to 12.8% in second-quarter 2017.

Further, the company opened eight Petsense stores during the reported quarter.Including these, the company inaugurated 38 namesake stores, closed one Del’s store and converted two Hometown Pet stores to Petsense stores in first-half 2017. During this time frame, Tractor Supply opened 17 Petsense outlets (including the aforementioned conversions). As of Jul 1, the company operated 1,630 Tractor Supply stores in 49 states, and 160 Petsense stores across 26 states.The Road AheadAs mentioned earlier, management remains impressed with the early third-quarter trends, given the continued solid demand for spring season products – thanks to favorable weather. Thus, the company is set to exploit the advantages of this extended spring selling period. Additionally, the company remains on track with its “One Tractor” initiative that is strengthening the connection between its physical and digital operations, thus augmenting the top line. Evidently, the company closed the rollout of its Buy Online Pick Up in Store program and continued to expand its Neighbor’s Club customer rewards program in the second quarter. Notably, the Buy Online Pick Up in Store program was well-received and contributed more than 55% to online sales.However, based on the overall first-half 2017 results, the company lowered its 2017 guidance.Updated Numbers Management now projects net sales in a band of $7.13–$7.19 billion, compared with $7.22–$7.29 billion expected earlier. Comps growth is now guided in a range of 1.1–1.7%, down from the previously guided range of 2–3% growth. The updated comps view includes a negative impact of about 30% from deflation.Gross margin is anticipated to be flat to down in 2017, owing to the dismal numbers in the first half. Both, SG&A expenses (including depreciation and amortization) and operating margin are expected to decline by 80 – 100 bps.Finally, Tractor Supply now envisions earnings per share in a band of $3.22–$3.27, as against its old forecast of $3.44–$3.52. Tractor Supply also updated its capital expenditures target for the year, from $270–$290 million to $250–$270 million.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?Following the release, investors have witnessed a downward trend in  fresh estimates.

"
1985,TSCO,"As impressive as its second-quarter results were, it was rather anticlimactic when it came to earnings estimates. A few weeks before the earnings announcement, Tractor Supply announced sales results for the quarter and, more importantly, raised its 2010 earnings and sales guidance.  
"
1986,TSCO,"Now the company expects earnings per share between $4 and $4.10, instead of $3.48 to $3.60. Sales are now anticipated between $3.49 billion and $3.53 billion, compared to the previous outlook of $3.44 billion to $3.5 billion. As a result, the sharp gain in earnings estimates of late can be traced back to this announcement, rather than the second-quarter results.   
"
1987,TSCO,"The Zacks Consensus Estimate for this year is $4.10 per share, which is up 10.2% from 2 months ago. Out of 17 total estimates, there has been only one upward revision in the past 30 days, which led to a three-cent improvement in that time, or less than 1%.  
"
1988,TSCO,"Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for next year is $4.63 per share, or nearly 13% better than 2010. The outlook has advanced by 9.7% in the past two months. Unlike this year though, there has been a lot more interest lately. In the past 30 days, five estimates were revised upward out of 19 total estimates. Theres even been a downward revision in that time. The result of this activity is a 1.3% improvement in the past month. Second-Quarter Report  
"
1989,TSCO,"For the second quarter, Tractor Supply earned $2.05 per share, compared to $1.50 last year. The result moved slightly past the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.03 by 1%. While not dramatic, the result continued an impressive streak of better-than-expected quarterly profit that has now stretched for nine quarters. The surprise over the last 4 quarters is 7.4%.  
"
1990,TSCO,"As TSCO had previously announced, net sales reached $1.07 billion in the quarter, or 12.6% better than last year's $946.5 million. Same-store sales were up 6.1%, driven by continued strong results in core consumable categories, including animal and pet-related products, and agricultural and seasonal products, including outdoor power equipment.

1998,TSCO,"Carbo Ceramics (CRR  -  Free Report) recently pulled back a bit with the market after hitting a new 52-week high above $83 in late July. The long-term trend however is still very bullish, as shares continue to advance along a trend line that has been in play since last year. Estimates are strong here too, with the current year up 22 cents in the last two months to $3.03 and the next year up 15 cents to $3.70, a bullish 22% growth projection.
"
1999,TSCO,"Shares and earnings estimates for Barnes & Noble, Inc.  are on the rise as the bookseller heads to its fiscal second-quarter report tomorrow.  
"
2000,TSCO,"At the moment, the Zacks Consensus Estimates for the quarter is 10 cents per share, which is up a penny, or 11.1%, over the past 7 days. 
"
2001,TSCO,"With a gain of about 5.5%, BKS is a Zacks #1 Rank Top Performer for Wednesday. Volume is nearly 1.2 million shares, which is above its daily average of approximately 950,000.   
"
2002,TSCO,"BKS is part of the very broad retail-miscellaneous/diversified industry. It is 1 of 5 companies from that space on today's 232-stock Zacks #1 Rank List, but none of the other companies are booksellers. (This eclectic group includes home products retailer Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. (BBBY  -  Free Report), equestrian products specialty retailer Dover Saddlery, Inc. (DOVR), crafts specialty retailer Jo-Ann Stores, Inc. (JAS) and farm products company Tractor Supply (TSCO  -  Free Report).) Earnings Estimates  
"
2003,TSCO,"BKS has enjoyed upward revisions from analysts in the past 7 days. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for this fiscal year, ending January 2010, is at $1.35 per share, which is up 3.8% from $1.30 in the past week. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for next fiscal year, ending January 2011, has advanced 5.1% from $1.37 in that time.  
"
2004,TSCO,"Therefore, analysts currently expect profit for next fiscal year to advance about 6.6% from this fiscal year.  
"
2005,TSCO,"Earnings estimates have been on the rise for a while now. In fact, the past 2 months have seen gains of 8.9% and 11.6% for this fiscal year and next, respectively. Barnes & Noble College Booksellers 
"
2006,TSCO,"BKS made some news earlier this month when it announced an agreement to acquire Barnes & Noble College Booksellers, Inc. for $596 million.  
"
2007,TSCO,"B&N College Booksellers has a leading market position in the $10 billion college bookstore industry. For fiscal 2009, it generated revenue of $1.8 billion and same-store sales growth of 1%.  
"
2008,TSCO,"This acquisition will provide BKS with a stake in the growing digital textbook space; an important avenue for the company given the very challenging conditions for booksellers.  
"
2009,TSCO,"""In a rapidly changing environment, both companies will benefit from a unified digital platform and brand, which will enable the combined company to capitalize on the growing online college textbook and electronic book markets,"" said Irene Miller, Chairperson of the Special Committee of the Board. 
"
2010,TSCO,"(The Special Committee was established by the BKS Board of Directors due to the related-party nature of the transaction.) Fiscal First Quarter  
"
2011,TSCO,"BKS reported a loss of 4 cents per share for its fiscal first quarter, which bettered the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a 15-cent loss by more than 73%.  
"
2012,TSCO,"The result also exceeded the company's guidance, thanks to better-than-expected revenues, gross margins and expense management.  
"
2013,TSCO,"Total sales declined 4% to $1.1 billion. Barnes & Noble store sales of $989 million were down 3.5%, while same-store sales declined 5.7%. Sales at Barnes & Noble.com were off 7%. 
"
2014,TSCO,"From November 20, 2008 to January 6, 2009, the S&P Retail Index [RLX] rose 41%. Not a bad move for a group of stocks that had one of the worst holiday shopping seasons in recent memory. It appears that investors became more bullish on retailers because of seemingly cheap valuations, anticipated benefits from a federal government stimulus package, and a better economy in the second half of 2009.
"
2015,TSCO,"In our view, the 50-day upward move in retail stocks was a bear-market rally. Investors should begin to lighten up on exposure to retail stocks. We expect the group to give back those gains as it becomes apparent that many retail stocks are not cheap, that the stimulus will provide at best a short-term boost, and the economy will not turn until 2010.
"
2016,TSCO,"Our negative view of the group is based on the awful 2008 holiday season, a reduction of leverage in the financial system and, most importantly, consumer attitudes shifting away from borrowing to make discretionary purchases. These factors all point to continued pressure on consumer spending.
"
2017,TSCO,"As a result, we believe that consumer and retailer trends that began in 2008 will continue throughout 2009. Consumers will focus their spending on necessary items such as food, clothing, and staples. Discretionary purchases will be made when items are significantly marked down. In turn, retailers will focus on reducing square footage, reducing leverage and reducing inventory. This will lead to further negative earnings estimate revisions for retailers for the next few quarters.   
"
2018,TSCO,"OPPORTUNITIES
"
2019,TSCO,"We see few opportunities in the near term. That said, investors looking for exposure should focus on retailers with stable revenue and earnings. These include defensive plays including discounters, retailers with debt-free balance sheets, and supermarkets.
"
2020,TSCO,"Two stocks we like in this environment are Kroger (KR  -  Free Report) and PetMed Express (PETS  -  Free Report).
"
2021,TSCO,"Krogers sales should remain relatively intact. Consumers will still need to shop for groceries even with in a weak economic environment. Kroger is doing a good job of gaining market share by competing on price and selection.
"
2022,TSCO,"PetMed Express operates the nationwide pet pharmacy 1800PetMeds.com. The company markets its health products for dogs, cats and horses. PETS revenue is holding up well in this challenging retail environment. The company continues to manage its operating costs, which has enabled the company to produce strong earnings growth.
"
2023,TSCO,"Another long-time favorite of ours is GameStop (GME  -  Free Report), which reported blow-out numbers for the holiday season with same-store sales up 10%. The company also increased its EPS guidance for the fourth quarter.
"
2024,TSCO,"WEAKNESSES
"
2025,TSCO,"We would avoid most names in retail. The stocks that are least attractive in this environment are those companies with levered balance sheets, marginal businesses, or those retailers that rely on the credit markets to buy inventory or sell its merchandise. We have Sell ratings on department stores including JC Penney (JCP  -  Free Report) and Nordstrom (JWN  -  Free Report), specialty retailers Cost Plus (CPWM) and Tractor Supply (TSCO  -  Free Report), and e-commerce firms Overstock.com (OSTK  -  Free Report) and Priceline.com (PCLN).
"
2026,TSCO,"First-quarter earnings season is off to a good start from the standpoint of earnings surprises. Among the 249 companies within the S&P 1500 (S&P 500, S&P Midcap 400 and S&P Smallcap 600) to have reported as of Thursday evening, 151 have exceeded expectations and 64 have missed estimates. (The rest have matched forecasts.) This equates to a surprise ratio of 2.4, which is better than the 1.88 ratio we saw about the same time during fourth-quarter earnings season. 
"
2027,TSCO,"Growth rates, however, have been notably slower. Average growth, excluding outliers, has been running at 4.3% versus 14.1% in the fourth-quarter. Banking and semiconductor companies have been a drag on the average growth rate. Investors should keep in mind that less than a quarter of companies have reported, so both the surprise and growth numbers are not fully representative of all industries. The expectation is that the average growth rate will rise as more reports come in.
"
2028,TSCO,"Nearly 850 companies are confirmed to report during the week of Apr 23 - 27, 174 of which are members of the S&P 500. Dow components 3M (MMM  -  Free Report), Boeing (BA  -  Free Report), Du Pont (DD), Exxon Mobil (XOM  -  Free Report) and Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) are on deck.
"
2029,TSCO,"The economic calendar only has a few reports. March existing home sales and the Conference Board's April consumer confidence index will be released on Tuesday. Wednesday features March durable goods orders and new home sales data. Thursday features the weekly initial jobless claims report. Nothing is scheduled for Friday.
"
2030,TSCO,"Companies That Could Issue Positive Earnings Surprises During the Week of Apr 23 - 27
"
2031,TSCO,"Black & Decker (BDK) raised its guidance last Monday. Crediting ""better-than-expected sales and operating margin,"" the company expects to report profits of about $1.60 per share. BDK had previously forecast earnings to be in a range of $1.25 to $1.30 per share. Six brokerage analysts adjusted their projections in response, causing the consensus to rise to $1.60 per share. BDK could still surprise, if past trends hold. The company has topped estimates during three out of the past four quarters. Black & Decker is scheduled to report on Wednesday, Apr 25, before the start of trading.
"
2032,TSCO,"Silicon Motion Technology (SIMO  -  Free Report) raised its sales guidance in late-March, crediting what it described as ""unexpected strength"". The company is benefiting from use of its controllers by Samsung, demand in China for SD and micro SD controllers and a broader product offering. All four covering brokerage analysts raised their forecasts in response, pushing the consensus earnings estimate up three cents to 30 cents per share.
"
2033,TSCO,"Tractor Supply (TSCO  -  Free Report) recently raised its first-quarter guidance. Demand for winter-related merchandise received a boost from cold weather and helped lead to same-store sales growth of 8.5%. As a result, the company expects that quarterly profits will be in a range of 10 to 12 cents per share. All of the covering brokerage analysts took notice and pushed the consensus estimate up 10 cents to 11 cents per share. TSCO exceeded estimates by a penny last quarter. Tractor Supply is scheduled to report on Wednesday, Apr 25, after the close of trading.
"
2034,TSCO,"Refining company Valero Energy (VLO  -  Free Report) could give investors a chance to make back some of the money they have been spending on gasoline. Nearly half of the covering brokerage analysts have raised their profit predictions within the past 30 days, causing the consensus estimate to jump by 18 cents to $1.72 per share. The Most Recent Consensus is even more bullish at $1.83 per share. VLO has exceeded expectations during each of the past three quarters by an average margin of 13.7 cents per share. Valero Energy is scheduled to report on Thursday, Apr 26.
"
2035,TSCO,"Companies That Could Issue Negative Earnings Surprises During the Week of Apr 23 - 27
"
2036,TSCO,"Goodyear (GT  -  Free Report) missed fourth-quarter expectations by three cents per share. It was the second miss in four quarters for the tire company. Ahead of GT's first-quarter report, brokerage analysts have been lowering their profit projections. The current consensus forecast, which calls for a loss of two cents per share, is six cents below the forecast of a month ago and 25 cents below the forecast of two months ago. The Most Recent Consensus is even more bearish; it calls for a loss of 30 cents per share. Goodyear is scheduled to report on Friday, Apr 27, before the start of trading.

2041,TSCO,"Optimism appears to be creeping back into the retail sector at just the right time.  The second half of the year has been historically the most important for these companies, due to the usually vibrant holiday season.  While big department store chains like  Dillard's  (NYSE:  DDS ) and  J.C. Penney  (NYSE:  JCP ) were likely ecstatic at the positives displayed in the month of July, for those retailers that deal in miscellaneous and diversified merchandise (a.k.a. specialty retailers) the news was just icing on the cake.  It was these retailers that performed best during the darkest days of the downturn, and they still enjoy a Zacks Industry Rank of 2.74, according to Nick Raich's  ""Weekly Earnings and Sector Update,""  placing it 35th out of more than 200 industries.  With conditions apparently improving, analysts are seeing plenty of profit potential for starved investors.   
"
2042,TSCO,"Figures for July showed a more than +4% rise in same-store sales for the retail industry.  While such an improvement was surely a welcomed sign, analysts took heart more with what it could mean for the future.  Such an advance was reflected in the S&P Retail Index, which finished the August 27th session at 360.99.  That's less than four points off of its 52-week high.  Furthermore, major retailers such as  Wal-Mart  (NYSE:  WMT ) and  Sears  (NYSE:  S ) offered up encouraging outlooks for the month of August and second half.  This leaves many analysts very excited that the second half of 2003 will show the more traditional spending bonanza, rather than the 2002 performance that registered the most anemic sales gain in 30 years.   
"
2043,TSCO,"Miscellaneous and diversified retailers plan to be part of the uptrend.  These retailers, which focus more on one particular type of product or lifestyle, has been the most fashionable in regards to consumers' changing tastes.  These companies find a niche and develop an attractive concept to drive traffic and sales.  The most successful (or lucky) of which are able to latch onto segments of the economy that are thriving.  For example, Bed Bath & Beyond sells home décor items, which means that the impressive performance of housing over the past several years has brought millions of homebuyers into their stores.  Furthermore, with DVD rentals surging, Blockbuster has made itself into the Wal-Mart of its specific space.  The industry's narrower focus gave it an edge on the larger, more traditional department store chains, whose product offerings were slimmer than the specialties and oftentimes more expensive.   
"
2044,TSCO,"Better weather conditions, a strengthening economy, and easy comparisons are several of the reasons why analysts feel that the second half will show improvement.  Furthermore, since most Americans love to spend, tax cuts and still-discounted prices are expected to bring in more traffic in the coming months.  One could only hope that the employment situation (which is a lagging indicator) and consumer confidence figures can push forward.  But, in the meantime, investors should be aware that the retail space is still on shaky ground.  However, there is plenty of opportunity out there.  Many miscellaneous and diversified retailers have proven themselves to be consistent and steady growers for years now.  Several of them performed well while others struggled, and with an improving outlook for the overall retail space, investors would be wise to pay attention to what the All Stars have to say.  You may be in line for a shopping spree thanks to profits made with these intelligent and proven retailers.  What Do the All Stars Recommend? 
"
2045,TSCO,"Although there's a good deal of optimism surrounding retail in general right now, the space remains challenged.  However, if you were to totally ignore this industry until the economy comes back strong, you would miss out on a great deal of profit potential.  By consulting analysts, you can find the stocks that are ready to rise, while staying away from those that are running in place.  Zacks tracks the analysts who cover the specialty retail industry and ranks them based on the performance of stocks recommended. Analysts with the best track record of success include:  C. Augustine  of The Bear Stearns Companies, Inc.;  D. Brodie  of Research Capital Corporation;  L. Champine  of Morgan Keegan;  G. Giblen  of C.L. King & Associates; and  B.

2046,TSCO,"Below are the top-ranked stocks recommended by the most  5-Star  analysts in the miscellaneous and diversified retail industry.  Note that these collection of companies live up to the ""miscellaneous and diversified"" tag.  They all deal in different niches and have become leaders in their respective fields.  Read the profiles below, than do a little of your own homework and decided if any of these companies have a place in your portfolio.  Bed Bath & Beyond Inc.  (NASDAQ:  BBBY ) is a nationwide operator of superstores selling predominantly better quality domestics merchandise and home furnishings typically found in better department stores. The company offers a wide assortment of merchandise at everyday low prices that are substantially below regular department store prices and generally comparable to or below department store sale prices. The company's domestics merchandise line includes items such as bed linens, bath accessories and kitchen textiles, and the company's home furnishings line.  In June, Bed Bath & Beyond announced a $200 million all cash acquisition of Christmas Tree Shops, Inc., a privately-held retailer of giftware and household items.  The company's president and CEO stated that Christmas Tree's product mix is compelling and extremely well-priced, with a significant portion of its merchandise represented by self-developed items or opportunistic buys.  As a result of its first fiscal quarter performance and the above-mentioned acquisition, Bed Bath & Beyond revised its earnings expectation for fiscal 2003 upward by three cents to $1.23.   
"
2047,TSCO,"In its fiscal first quarter performance from June, Bed Bath & Beyond reported net earnings of 19 cents per share.  That surpassed the year-ago performance of 15 cents by more than +24%, and was also enough to edge out the consensus by a penny.  Furthermore, net sales improved by more than +15% to $893.9 million from $776.8 million in the year-ago quarter.  Same-store sales advanced by about +4.4% in the quarter.  Bed Bath & Beyond has been one of the more consistent companies in the retail industry for several years now, with per-share advances of over +25% in each year over the past decade.  It also has an excellent history of surpassing Wall Street's quarterly earnings estimates.  To further research Bed Bath & Beyond, click  BBBY .  Guitar Center, Inc.  (NASDAQ:  GTRC ) is the nation's leading retailer of guitars, amplifiers, percussion instruments, keyboards and pro-audio and recording equipment.

Musician's Friend, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Guitar Center, Inc., is the one of the largest catalog and Internet retailers of musical instruments in the United States through the Musician's Friend catalog and its website.  Guitar Center has succeeded since going public in 1996 because it addressed an under-served market.  Since that time the company has become a one-stop-shop for all of your musical instrument needs, selling a variety of brands.   
"
2048,TSCO,"For its second quarter 2003, Guitar Center reported earnings per diluted share of 25 cents on net sales of $291.6 million.  The earnings result was more than +31% atop the consensus expectation of 19 cents, and also well ahead of last year's 18-cent result.  Meanwhile, net sales advanced by almost +15%.  In the company's retail division, Guitar Center's same-store sales advanced by +5%.  Furthermore, as with many of the most successful retailers, much of Guitar Center's success and appeal can be traced to its Musician's Friend catalog and website, which was honored in June for production of one of the country's top catalogs and its leading e-commerce web site at the Annual Catalog Awards and I.MERCHANT Awards.  At about the same time, Musician's Friend reached the one-millionth-order milestone on the website.  Finally, Marty Albertson, President and Co-Chief Executive Officer, stated, ""We have improved the company's financial strength with our recently completed convertible debt offering.  Given our strong results at the halfway point of 2003, we are confident in our ability to meet our objectives for the year.""  To further research Guitar Center, click  GTRC .  Michaels Stores, Inc.

Very recently, Michaels Stores reported second quarter diluted earnings of 35 cents per share, which beat the consensus by 2 cents while also improving by +17% from the year-ago total of 30 cents.  In the quarter, total sales advanced by +7% to $616.5 million from $576.6 million, with same-store sales moving forward by +1%.

2049,TSCO,"Arts and crafts have always been a popular hobby, but Michaels Stores has taken it to the next levels and has become the leading presence in this niche.  That's one of the main reason why four All Stars are recommending this stock.  However, the company also has easier comparison to look forward to, which will be coming to the forefront just as industry conditions are expected to improve in the third and fourth quarters.  Michaels Stores expects a strong second half for the year, and most analysts are agreeing.  To further research Michaels Stores, click  MIK .  Tractor Supply Company  (NASDAQ:  TSCO ) is a specialty retailer that supplies the daily farming and maintenance needs of its target customers: hobby, part-time and full-time farmers and ranchers, as well as rural customers, contractors and tradesmen.  Despite conditions that made the second quarter quite challenging, especially a late spring and cool, wet weather, Tractor Supply was still able to report earnings that slightly exceeded the consensus while also improving upon last year.  Net sales of $449.4 million were approximately +14.6% higher than the year-ago performance, as same-store sales increased by +1.2%.  The company felt that it's sales performance would have been better were it not for the two above-mentioned factors, which impacted seasonal products such as lawn mowers and lawn tractors.  Tractor Supply said neither economic nor competitive factors had a significant impact on the sales performance.  The company was able to maintain strong top line performance in its core offerings, while keeping its overall bottom line performance in line with expectations.   
"
2050,TSCO,"More recently, in late July, Tractor Supply's Board of Directors approved a two-for-one stock split of the company's common stock.  The number of outstanding shares of common stock will increase to approximately 37.2 million from about 18.6 million.  Joe Scarlett, Chairman of the Board and CEO, stated, ""The Board's decision to approve a stock split recognizes our confidence in the ability to grow the Tractor Supply Company chain from 460 stores to approximately 700 stores over the next four years as well as the significant long-term opportunities for the business.""  He went on to say that the split would enhance liquidity while making its common stock more attractive to a broader range of investors.  To further research Tractor Supply Company, click  TSCO .

Blockbuster seems to be in the right place at the right time.

In late July, the company reported second quarter net income of 34 cents per diluted share on total revenues of $1.39 billion.  That earnings result came in almost +47% ahead of the year-ago performance and beat the consensus by more than +41%, while total revenues advanced by +9.5% thanks to the net addition of 535 company-operated stores.  Furthermore, worldwide same-store revenues advanced by +1%.  The company's leading position in an industry that appears to have excellent momentum moving forward is one of the main reasons why All Stars are keeping their attention on this company.   
"
2051,TSCO,"Furthermore, Blockbuster recently won a lawsuit brought on by independent video retailers.  The suit was brought against Blockbuster and the motion picture studios, which challenged the company's revenue sharing deals with the motion picture studios.  The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit upheld a lower court's decision from June of 2002.  The Court stated that a company can set ambitious goals without slipping into illegal means.  Ambitious goals are certainly what Blockbuster has been using to improve operating margin while maximizing profitability and cash flow.  To further research Blockbuster, Inc., click  BBI .

2052,TSCO,"Farm and ranch store retailer, Tractor Supply Company (TSCO  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 26, after the market closes. Last quarter, the company posted earnings in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Notably, the company has delivered positive earnings surprise in two of the trailing four quarters, recording an average earnings beat of 0.9%.Tractor Supply Company Price and EPS Surprise  Tractor Supply Company Price and EPS Surprise | Tractor Supply Company QuoteWhat to Expect?The question lingering in investors’ minds now is whether Tractor Supply will be able to post positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is $1.28, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 10.2%. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has been stable ahead of the earnings release. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $2.03 billion, up 9.4% from the year-ago quarter.However, we note that the stock has underperformed both the Zacks categorized Retail – Miscellaneous industry and the Retail-Wholesale sector in the last three months. The company’s shares have declined 20.2%, while the Zacks categorized industry has dipped 10.8%. Meanwhile, the sector has witnessed growth of 5.6%.Factors at PlayTractor Supply has been struggling for quite some time now due to challenging economic backdrop at the agricultural and energy sectors. This has been taking a toll on consumer spending and been weighing on its top-line performance.While the company’s revenues came marginally ahead of estimate in first-quarter 2017, comps declined due to a fall in comparable transaction count and average ticket. Further, comps were hurt by soft seasonal merchandise sales, along with deflationary pressure. Moreover, its margins continue to be under pressure due to increased markdowns, higher promotional activities as well as due to rise in freight expense for consumable, usable and edible (C.U.E.) products.Nevertheless, the company remains hopeful of the spring selling season, wherein it anticipates seasonal merchandise sales to witness some improvement. Further, its upcoming merchandise strategies and constant implementation of cross-network consumer-centric growth plans reflect its spring season prospects. Also, the company's focus on enhancement of IT systems and supply chain bode well.While the company’s growth prospects and optimism for the spring season are noteworthy, we cannot ignore the current trends in the agricultural sector and its dependence on seasons. So, let’s see if Tractor Supply’s initiatives can help it tide over the current trends.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Tractor Supply is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Tractor Supply has an Earnings ESP of -2.34% as the Most Accurate estimate of $1.25 is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.28. Further, the company has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.

2053,TSCO,"With the economy improving and the stock market rising, consumers are feeling more confident about opening their wallets again.
"
2054,TSCO,"This trend can be seen in monthly retail sales:
"
2055,TSCO,"This is great news for the retail industry, but does this mean that all retail stocks are worth buying?
"
2056,TSCO,"Not So Fast
"
2057,TSCO,"While the industry is expected to see solid growth overall this year, there will certainly be some retailers who see tremendous growth and those who get left behind.
"
2058,TSCO,"But how do you know which ones to buy and which ones to avoid?
"
2059,TSCO,"One important item to look at is same-store sales. This metric compares sales across stores open at least a year. This is also known as comp sales.
"
2060,TSCO,"This is beneficial because it allows investors and analysts to compare sales between different retailers and can alert them to shifts in consumer demand. Total sales growth, while important, will naturally be higher among retailers who are rapidly opening new stores. Same-store sales ignores this, however, and only focuses on sales at existing stores.
"
2061,TSCO,"It's also beneficial in that it excludes the ""honeymoon phase"" of strong sales typically experienced shortly after stores are opened in new locations. 
"
2062,TSCO,"Early Warning Signs
"
2063,TSCO,"It can also make it easier to spot shifts in consumer tastes or preferences. Although overall sales for a company might be up, a few consecutive months of negative comp sales can signal trouble ahead.
"
2064,TSCO,"Compare high-end retailer Nordstrom with off-price retailer TJX Companies, which owns T.J. Maxx, Marshalls and HomeGoods stores, during the heart of the recession:
"
2065,TSCO,"Clearly, consumer habits shifted away from luxury retailers and towards more value-oriented companies during the Great Recession.
"
2066,TSCO,"As the economy continues to pick up, however, which companies are now seeing consistent increases in same-store sales?
"
2067,TSCO,"Here are 4 companies seeing strong same-store sales:PriceSmart (PSMT  -  Free Report)
"
2068,TSCO,"PriceSmart operates 28 U.S.-style membership warehouse clubs in Central America and the Caribbean. Many might question whether this business model would work in Latin America. The same-store sales numbers speak for themselves:
"
2069,TSCO,"The company will be expanding into South America later this year with the opening of a store in Colombia. It is a Zacks #2 Rank (Buy) stock.
"
2070,TSCO,"Limited Brands (LTD)
"
2071,TSCO,"LTD operates well-known brands Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works. Same-store sales have been strong over the last several months, including a remarkable 24% increase in January (35% at Victoria's Secret):
"
2072,TSCO,"Valuation is attractive with a PEG ratio of 0.97. It is a Zacks #3 Rank (Hold) stock.
"
2073,TSCO,"Zumiez
"
2074,TSCO,"Zumiez (pronounced ""zoomies"") is a retailer focused on action sports like skateboarding, surfing, snowboarding, motocross and BMX. Same-store sales have been surging over the last several months:

2075,TSCO,"The company carries no long-term debt and is a Zacks #3 Rank (Hold) stock.
"
2076,TSCO,"Tractor Supply Co (TSCO  -  Free Report)
"
2077,TSCO,"This rural-focused retailer has been on a tear lately. Estimates have been surging after it recently delivered a strong fourth quarter in which EPS came in 8% above the Zacks Consensus Estimate.
"
2078,TSCO,"Rising agricultural prices have certainly played a role in Tractor Supply's strong results. The company reports sales each quarter rather than on a monthly basis, and the results have been impressive:
"
2079,TSCO,"Q4 Same-store sales: 13.1%
"
2080,TSCO,"Q3 Same-store sales:  5.0%
"

"
2082,TSCO,"Tractor Supply is a Zacks #2 Rank (Buy) stock.
"
2083,TSCO,"Conclusion
"
2084,TSCO,"When evaluating retail stocks, it's important to look at a company's recent same-store sales trends. These 4 are seeing strong demand for their products in existing locations, which should lead to rising earnings estimates and rising stock prices.
"
2085,TSCO,"Todd Bunton is the Growth & Income Stock Strategist for Zacks.com.
"
2086,TSCO,"Both estimates and shares of Tractor Supply Co (TSCO  -  Free Report) have been soaring over the last 12 months as the rural-based retailer continues to post impressive results.
"
2087,TSCO,"This trend continued in the fourth quarter, in which the company reported an amazing 13.1% increase in same-store sales. It is a Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stock.
"
2088,TSCO,"Fourth Quarter Results
"
2089,TSCO,"On January 26, the company reported fourth quarter earnings per share of 67 cents, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 62 cents. It was a 31% increase over the same quarter in 2009.
"
2090,TSCO,"Net sales were up 19.7% driven by an incredible 13.1% same-store sales increase.
"
2091,TSCO,"The only weak spot in the quarter was the gross margin, which fell slightly from 32.9% of sales to 32.6%. Meanwhile, operating income surged 36.0% year-over-year as the company was able to leverage its selling, general and administrative expenses. 
"
2092,TSCO,"Outlook
"
2093,TSCO,"Estimates have been surging over the last several months as Tractor Supply continues to deliver impressive results:
"
2094,TSCO,"It is a Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stock.
"
2095,TSCO,"The company expects to earn between $2.54 and $2.62 per share in 2011 on same-store sales growth of 2.5% to 4.5%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is at the upper end of guidance at $2.62, representing a 17% increase over 2010 EPS.
"
2096,TSCO,"The 2012 consensus estimate is currently $2.98, equating to 14% growth.
"
2097,TSCO,"Valuation
"
2098,TSCO,"The stock has been on a tear, more than doubling in the last 12 months:
"
2099,TSCO,"Because earnings estimates have been soaring too, valuation remains in check. Shares trade at 20.3x forward earnings, a premium to the industry average of 16.3x, but its PEG ratio is a reasonable 1.3.
"
2100,TSCO,"Tractor Supply operates 1,001 rural-based stores in 44 states throughout the U.S. Since it was added to the Focus List on August 5, 2010, TSCO is up 52%.
"
2101,TSCO,"Todd Bunton is the Growth & Income Stock Strategist for Zacks.com.
"
2102,TSCO,"The market's recent positive momentum reflects the solid second-quarter earnings season and the relatively reassuring guidance from management teams about the coming quarters. There is ample evidence that the economy appears to be moving into a moderate patch of economic growth in the next few quarters, but will most likely avoid some of the more dire outcomes.  
"
2103,TSCO,"The emerging narrative of moderate but sustainable domestic economic growth, solid corporate profitability, low interest rates and a robust emerging-market growth outlook should help the equity markets drift upwards in the coming months. While I am not necessarily looking for straight upward moves in the benchmark indices going forward, I do envision the overall trend to be positive.   
"
2104,TSCO,"But risks remain to this favorable view; the biggest being reversal in the recent positive, albeit very slow, improvement in private-sector hiring, as well as fears of deflation. Moderate Economic Growth 
"
2105,TSCO,"In-line with recent soft economic reports, estimates for second-half economic growth have been steadily coming down in recent days. These lowered market expectations put third- and fourth-quarter GDP growth rates at 2.2% and 2.8%, respectively. In the first and second quarters of this year, the economy generated growth rates of 3.7% and 2.4%.  
"
2106,TSCO,"An unbiased reading of the economic reports point to a temporary growth moderation in the next couple of quarters with enough fundamental support to resume normal growth next year and beyond. The corporate sector remains in excellent financial health, with growing evidence that firms have started using their record cash hoard towards capital investments. Corporate outlays for equipment and software continue to expand  with a gain of 17% in the second quarter after a 7.8% increase in the first quarter. As such, even though manufacturing activity levels appear to have softened lately, investment spending should remain supportive to growth in the coming quarters.  Slow-Healing Labor Market 
"
2107,TSCO,"While the corporate balance sheets remain in excellent shape, the same can't be said of the household sector. It is this lack of a clear handoff of the recovery from the corporate side to the household side that has been the source of uncertainty for the economic outlook. Deleveraging households in a backdrop of long-lasting labor market weakness remains the weakest part of this economic recovery.  
"
2108,TSCO,"In the absence of a solid turnaround in the labor market, we need the trend of positive private sector job creations in the last seven months to remain in place. Gains in temporary hirings, hourly earnings and the workweek all point to a slow-healing labor market. Reversal of these trends remains a major risk factor to our market outlook.  Supportive Fed 
"
2109,TSCO,"With benchmark short-term interest rates at historically low levels, many pundits are bemoaning the lack of arrows in the Fed's quiver. But counting the Fed out may be premature.   
"
2110,TSCO,"They can engineer quantitative easing through a number of ways in response to the moderating growth outlook and continued labor market issues. The most readily available tool being a resumption of the treasury-bond purchases that they discontinued in the spring. At a minimum, the markets can remain assured that the Fed's continued usage of the extended period reference means that interest rates will remain low for quite a long period.  
"
2111,TSCO,"I was initially looking for an early-2011 timeframe for the onset of the Fed's tightening phase. But now, I don't think the Fed will start removing the monetary stimulus before late 2011. An environment of low interest rates and a supportive Fed are key positives for stocks. Solid Corporate Profitability
"
2112,TSCO,"As referred to earlier, the turnaround in corporate profitability remains firmly in place. We had solid earnings reports in the second quarter, with year-over-year gains in excess of 40% and more than 75% of companies beating expectations. And not all of the gains have come from cost cutting alone. More than 59% of the firms have beat revenue expectations, with overall top-line gains in excess of 10%.   
"
2113,TSCO,"Not only have second-quarter earnings been solid, but management teams have been coming out with reassuring guidance for the coming quarters. Given the tendency for management teams to be inherently conservative with respect to guidance  often under-promising and over-delivering  the odds are looking good that current earnings expectations will be met, if not surpassed. Current expectations for full-year 2010 and 2011 earnings gains are approximately 34% and 19%, respectively.Portfolio Update 
"
2114,TSCO,"We made four changes to the Focus List portfolio last week; adding and deleting two each. We didn't make any changes to the Growth & Income portfolio. There were changes to the Timely Buys list as well.   
"
2115,TSCO,"A quick comment on the year-to-date performance of the Focus List and G&I portfolios is in order here. Returns on both the portfolios handily beat the S&P 500.  
"
2116,TSCO,"We added Carbo Ceramics (CRR  -  Free Report) to gain exposure to the fast-growing shale natural gas development scene. This $1.8 billion oilfield service player is a major supplier of a key chemical that is used in the development of shale natural gas fields, in addition to other services. A favorable outlook for shale natural gas development underpins the company's solid earnings prospects.   
"
2117,TSCO,"We added Tractor Supply Co. (TSCO  -  Free Report) to gain exposure to a favorable outlook for the rural economy given positive prospects for agricultural commodities. This $2.8 billion market operator of 930 retail farm and ranch stores in 44 states has a solid earnings track record, with beats in the last 9 consecutive quarters and estimates on the rise.   
"
2118,TSCO,"We dropped Cracker Barrel Old Country Store (CBRL  -  Free Report) after the stock fell to a Zacks # 4 Rank ('Sell'). While estimates have held up and the investment story remains intact, we don't see any near-term catalysts that can aid the stock price over the coming days. We had added the stock in June and took a roughly 2% loss on this one.  
"
2119,TSCO,"We exited our Parker Hannifin (PH  -  Free Report) position to get ahead of negative estimate revisions in the coming days, in our view. We had a 2.5% gain in the stock. The company reported solid results, but provided an under-whelming guidance for next year. We think that estimates would be coming down in the coming days to reflect the weak guidance. 
"
2120,TSCO,"We're going to stick with retailers a little while longer and today highlight Jo-Ann Stores, Inc. (JAS), a home decorating and crafts company that just surprised in its fiscal second quarter while boosting its full-year outlook.  
"
2121,TSCO,"Shares of this Zacks #1 Rank Top Performer are up approximately 9% Thursday. Volume is well above normal at about 715,000 shares, compared to the daily average of 187,000.  
"
2122,TSCO,"JAS is 1 of 4 companies from the retail-miscellaneous/diversified industry on today's Zacks #1 Rank List, which includes 229 stocks in total. The other 3 companies are Dick's Sporting Goods, Inc. (DKS  -  Free Report), Dover Saddlery, Inc. (DOVR) and Tractor Supply Company (TSCO  -  Free Report).Fiscal Second Quarter Results  
"
2123,TSCO,"Yesterday, JAS announced a loss per share of 13 cents in its fiscal second quarter. This loss was narrower than both the year-ago loss of 47 cents, and the Zacks Consensus Estimate for a loss of 39 cents.   
"
2124,TSCO,"Meanwhile, net sales advanced 4.1% to $419.4 million from $403 million, which sets JAS apart from many retailers who are beating quarterly profit expectations but still suffering through steep year-over-year declines in revenue.  
"
2125,TSCO,"Same-store sales were up 1.8%.  
"
2126,TSCO,"The company gave credit for its quarterly performance to continued sales growth, margin expansion and expense leverage.  
"
2127,TSCO,"""We continue to plan cautiously for the remainder of fiscal 2010, but our progress in the first half leaves us confident that sales and earnings will exceed our original expectation for the full year,"" said Chairman/President/CEO Darrell Webb. Fiscal 2010 Outlook  
"
2128,TSCO,"JAS is so confident in its full year performance that it raised its EPS guidance to between $1.35 and $1.50, compared to its previous outlook of 70 cents to 85 cents. The company also expects same-store sales to be flat to up 1%. Earnings Estimates  
"
2129,TSCO,"The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fiscal year ending January 2010 is currently at $1.08 per share, which is up 9% over the past month. 
"
2130,TSCO,"For next fiscal year, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has advanced to $1.37 from $1.29 - an improvement of 6.2% in the past 30 days. The result also suggests year-over-year profit growth of as much as 27%. 
"
2131,TSCO,"Tractor Supply Company (TSCO  -  Free Report) just jumped beyond a key level of resistance at $45 after reporting strong second-quarter results in late July.  
"
2132,TSCO,"Company Description
"
2133,TSCO,"Tractor Supply Company operates retail farm and ranch stores in the United States. The company was founded in 1938 and has a market cap of $1.69 billion. 
"
2134,TSCO,"Shares of TSCO have been on a nice rally for the last month as optimism has swung back into the market. The company helped its cause on July 22 when it reported solid second-quarter results that were ahead of expectations. 
"
2135,TSCO,"Second-Quarter Results
"
2136,TSCO,"Revenue was up 5% from last year to $946.5 million. Earnings came in at $1.50, one penny better than the Zacks Consensus Estimate. 
"
2137,TSCO,"Tractor Supply has beat the consensus in each of the last 4 quarters by an average of 4 cents, or 34%.
"
2138,TSCO,"Margin Expansion
"
2139,TSCO,"The company's results were helped by a dramatic improvement in its gross margin, which jumped 10.5% to 31.9% of sales. 
"
2140,TSCO,"Estimates Jump
"
2141,TSCO,"After word of the good quarter hit the street, analysts were quick to boost their earnings targets. The current year added 23 cents, climbing to $2.87 per share. The next-year estimate is projecting 9% earnings growth. 
"
2142,TSCO,"Valuation
"
2143,TSCO,"Not only does Tractor Supply have nice sales and earnings growth, it is also reasonably priced, trading with a P/E multiple of 16X, a slight discount to the overall market. 
"
2144,TSCO,"The Chart
"
2145,TSCO,"Shares of TSCO have been rallying since bottoming out with the overall market in early March. More recently, this stock jumped past a key level of resistance at the $45 mark. Take a look below. 
"
2146,TSCO,"Earnings season will hit full stride with reports from nearly 500 companies. Approximately 1 out of every 4 earnings release will be from a firm in the financial sector.
"
2147,TSCO,"Large-cap stocks will once again dominate the headlines, as 139 S&P 500 members are on the docket. Included are Dow components 3M (MMM  -  Free Report), American Express (AXP), AT&T (T  -  Free Report), Boeing (BA  -  Free Report), Caterpillar (CAT  -  Free Report), Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report), E.I. Du Pont (DD), Merck (MRK  -  Free Report), Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) and Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report).
"
2148,TSCO,"The highlight of the economic calendar will be Ben Bernanke's semi-annual report on monetary policy (aka Humphrey-Hawkins). The Fed Chairman will appear before a House committee on Tuesday and a Senate committee on Wednesday.
"
2149,TSCO,"Otherwise, there will not be much news on the economic front.

2150,TSCO,"Monday: June Leading Indicators
"
2151,TSCO,"Wednesday: weekly crude inventories

2153,TSCO,"Friday: Revised July University of Michigan consumer sentiment 
"
2154,TSCO,"Atlanta Fed President Dennis Lockhart will discuss his economic outlook with the Rotary Club of Nashville on Monday. No other Fed officials are scheduled to speak.
"
2155,TSCO,"The market really has not reacted much to better-than-expected earnings. Though a big rally did occur last Wednesday, volume outside the semiconductor group was generally light. And yesterday's afternoon rally was in reaction to comments made by Nouriel Roubini that were taken out of context.
"
2156,TSCO,"This raises the possibility that we could see more of the same for the coming week. If traders are not expressing joy over blowout earnings from Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report), then it seems unlikely that Jefferies Group (JEF) could say anything that would move the markets.
"
2157,TSCO,"If there is going to be a move to the upside, tech will have to be the catalyst. And we do have a handful of large-cap tech companies reporting (e.g. MSFT, Texas Instruments (TXN  -  Free Report), etc.), so there is the possibility of some good daily moves.
"
2158,TSCO,"But, investors should continue to eye volume, which continues to signal a willingness among many to simply sit on the sidelines.
"
2159,TSCO,"Companies That Could Issue Positive Earnings SurprisesIntersil (ISIL) raised its second-quarter revenue guidance late last month. The majority of the covering analysts responded by hiking their quarterly profit projections. These revisions led to a 5-cent increase in the consensus earnings estimate, to 9 cents per share. The semiconductor company has topped expectations during 5 out of the last 6 quarters. Intersil is scheduled to report on Wednesday, Jul 22, after the close of trading.
"
2160,TSCO,"Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report) is a riskier pick, given that it has disappointed investors for 2 consecutive quarters. But, the company did raise its fiscal third-quarter guidance last month, citing strong demand for wireless broadband. Furthermore, one analyst upped his quarterly forecast this week. The consensus estimate now calls for profits of 45 cents per share (up 2 cents from a month ago). The most accurate estimate is more bullish at 46 cents per share. Qualcomm is scheduled to report on Wed, Jul 22, after the close of trading.
"
2161,TSCO,"Last month, Texas Instruments (TXN  -  Free Report) updated its second-quarter forecast. This resulted in a sharp increase in the consensus estimate to 19 cents per share, the midpoint of TXN's suggested range. Could this forecast still be too conservative? Judging by the fact that 2 brokerage analysts just raised their second-quarter forecasts and the bullish results from other chip makers, the answer could well be yes. TXN has topped expectations for 2 consecutive quarters. Texas Instruments is scheduled to report on Monday, Jul 20, after the close of trading.
"
2162,TSCO,"Tractor Supply (TSCO  -  Free Report) anticipates reporting second-quarter earnings of $1.48 to $1.50 per share. The recent guidance was far above the consensus estimate and caused all of the covering analysts to revise their projections. Though the consensus estimate now calls for profits of $1.49 per share, there is still room for further upside given TSCO's streak of 4 consecutive positive earnings surprises. Tractor Supply is scheduled to report on Wednesday, Jul 22, after the close of trading.

2163,TSCO,"Companies That Could Issue Negative Earnings SurprisesCaterpillar (CAT  -  Free Report) has disappointed investors during 2 out of the last 3 quarters. Though the slowing pace of economic contraction should be a positive for CAT, 5 analysts have cut their second-quarter profit forecasts within the past 30 days. The revisions have caused the consensus earnings estimate to fall by 3 cents to 21 cents per share. The most accurate estimate is more bearish at 14 cents per share. Caterpillar is scheduled to report on Tuesday, Jul 21, before the start of trading.
