0,ALGN,"Medical products stock Align Technology pulled back in the four sessions through Friday, breaking its eight-week rally and tripping a stock-selling signal for swing-trade investors.The developer of the widely used clear orthodontic braces broke out of a cup-with-handle base on April 18. Align Technology (ALGN) immediately dropped more than 8% below the base's 277.41 buy point, triggering the automatic cut-loss rule. Shares turned and retook the buy point in healthy trade on May 10 and 11.The eight-week advance drove shares to as high as 371.55 on June 18, 34% above the April entry. CAN SLIM investors should have taken at least some profit as the stock climbed past the 20% gain mark at the end of May.Active short-term investors may also have carved off another piece of profit as the stock broke below its 10-day moving average on Friday. It was the first such break since retaking the buy point in May.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

But it's equally likely that the stock will either fall further, or settle into a weekslong consolidation likely to eventually produce another buy point.The odds suggest that taking a piece of the position off the table in defense of those possibilities leads to more gain than pain. But there is no reason to exit the stock entirely.The San Jose, Calif.-based company's prospects remain healthy. Analyst consensus projects a 30% EPS gain this year, followed by a 27% advance in 2019.Revenue is forecast to grow 32% and 24% for the two years. Consensus views look for a 27% EPS gain to $1.08 in the second quarter. Align has cleared consensus expectations over the past four quarters, with beats ranging from 16% to 24%.But the company could be due for some moderation in growth. The big-cap stock's annual revenue surged 36% last year, and it is set to break the $2 billion barrier in 2019. Annual earnings growth accelerated to 56% last year. Quarterly EPS growth rates hit 100% and 98% in Q4 and Q1. A sharp slowdown from those levels could trigger another form of sell signal.RELATED: Use The 10-Day Moving Average To Get Ahead Of Sell Signals Know This Sell Signal: Earnings Slowdown Says 'Sell,' But It Can Be ...How Far Will Abiomed, 3 More Growth Stocks In The Medical Sector Run?

1,ALGN,"With earnings on tap for Apr. 25, IBD 50 and Sector Leaders member Align Technology (ALGN) is trading approximately 2% below a 277.42 buy point.

2,ALGN,"Align Technology (ALGN), the company that helps straighten teeth, has to straighten out its own stock chart. X The stock is forming a cup-with-handle base with a buy point at 277.41. But much of the handle that has formed over the past four weeks is partly submerged under the 50-day moving average. A successful breakout seldom…

3,ALGN,"In the cup with handle or double bottom, success of the breakout depends on the way a stock rises and falls within the base.A third pattern shows that a stock can choose to take neither path before its big move north.Rather than go on an uptrend or downtrend, the stock moves sideways for weeks or months. This action — or lack of it — becomes what's called the flat base.This pattern often forms after a stock breaks out of a cup or other base, gains ground for a few weeks, then stalls. Why? The market might not be ready to rally strongly, or is still weak.A flat base reflects unusual strength. Instead of bending lower, it holds steady in price. This action tells you the stock wants to run higher.When the market finally begins to rally, the stock explodes out of its crouch position.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseA flat base must be at least five weeks in length. It can last much longer than that. Within the base, the percentage decline from the stock's high to low usually ranges within 10% to 15%. When the stock drops within the base, institutional investors step in to shore up the stock. The stock doesn't fall much more because investors overall feel comfortable with the stock's current price.When should you buy? Wait until the stock rises 10 cents above the highest price in the flat base. Sometimes the price high is found on the left end of the base. In other cases, the high is in the middle of the base or on the right. Just add 10 cents to that price to find the pivot. Buy it as close as possible to that price point. Don't chase it if it's already more than 5% above the pivot.Oracle (ORCL), the database and e-commerce software giant, muscled out of a seven-month cup with handle on Sept. 3, 1999 (1). In five sessions, the stock rose 18% and hit new highs. A fine start.The market suffered choppy action. From Sept. 13 the Nasdaq tumbled 7% over the next two weeks, yet held up above its 50-day moving average. Two weeks later, it strode to a new high. But the next two weeks saw the Nasdaq fall 10%, and briefly below the 50-day.Oracle dug in its heels. Growth stocks tend to fall 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 times the correction in the major indexes. Not Oracle. The stock held up above 40 during most of its seven-week flat base (2). On an intraday basis, it was no more than 15% below its high.The high on the left side of the flat base was 46.94. Add a dime to get the buy point. Oracle briefly poked above the flat base's 47.04 buy point during the week ended Oct. 15, 1999, but stumbled. A week later, Oracle dropped more than 8% below the prime entry, ushering the golden rule of investing. Some breakouts turn out to be fakeouts.However, one day after the Nasdaq staged a follow-through day on Oct. 28, Oracle broke out for real. It rallied on heavy volume for seven straight sessions (3). A follow-though is a critical signal that the market has possibly bottomed and is ready for a significant turn higher.At the time, Oracle scored an excellent 95 Earnings Per Share Rating, as seen in IBD Stock Checkup, and an A for SMR (Sales + Margins + Return on equity). The stock's relative strength line, painted in blue in every IBD daily and weekly chart, shoved into new high ground. The enterprise software group was ranked third among 197 groups.Oracle gained 273% through its March 2000 peak.Here are three more good flat bases that formed in 2016 and 2017 and yielded strong breakouts:Align Technology (ALGN), breakout on Feb. 21, 2017: The nine-week flat base began on Dec. 19, 2016, when the invisible braces marketer peaked at 102.10. Total decline within the base: 13%. Heavy volume was largely absent as Align cleared the 102.20 buy point, yet check out the strong gain on Feb. 1 following quarterly results.Align gapped up 6% and turnover boomed 272% above average. That was a clear sign of strong institutional buying.You can see historical charts of Align and all other U.S. stocks by going to MarketSmith, IBD's advanced charting and stock screening service.Control4 (CTRL), breakout on July 12, 2017: Volume powered 305% above the 50-day moving average on breakout day. In small-cap stocks, volume often rockets double or triple average levels. Total decline within the base: 13.5%.Notice on a weekly chart how as the base formed, the 10-week moving average contained the stock's move.The 10-week line is drawn in red on both an IBD chart and in MarketSmith.Arista Networks (ANET), breakouts on Nov. 14, 2016, and on Feb. 17, 2017: In the first flat base, Arista took the minimum five weeks to complete the base, which sat on top of a much larger first-stage construction. The proper buy point was 87.72. Total decline within the base: 10%.In the second flat base, Arista vaulted out of the base in a breakaway gap past 103.10. On Feb. 17, the data center networking play opened at 111, 7.7% above the proper buy point. Given the huge opening move and strong fundamentals, it would have been perfectly acceptable to buy right at the open. Arista finished the session at 119.06. Turnover mushroomed to 5.9 million shares, 609% above average. Total decline within the six-week base: 15.2%.(A version of this column was originally published in the March 26, 2002, edition of IBD.

The stock's fall triggered the 7%-8% loss-cutting sell signal from a 277.42 cup-with-handle entry.However, there were two major flaws in the stock's basing pattern. First, the cup with handle was a later-stage base, which increases the risk of failure. Second, the stock's breakout on April 18 could only be described as meek. The stock briefly poked above the entry before closing just under it, and volume was tepid.The breakout day should leave no doubt as to the stock's strength, with a volume increase of at least 40% above average.Elsewhere, LGI Homes (LGIH) faltered Thursday amid weakness within the overall homebuilder group.

70,ALGN,"Futures for the S&P 500 index, Dow industrials and Nasdaq 100 rebounded strongly Wednesday morning after the major averages suffered a bearish reversal from all-time highs on Tuesday, closing modestly lower.X Chip-equipment giant ASML Holding (ASML) surged before the open on strong earnings and guidance. ASML is one of several leading stocks, including Atlassian (TEAM), Align Technology (ALGN) and Scientific Games (SGMS) that tried to break out Tuesday but closed below buy points.But all four stocks closed higher, giving these stocks a day of outperformance vs. the S&P 500 index.Separately, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) nearly reached a buy point, closing near the top of its range.Keep in mind that several of these stocks are in late-stage patterns. Atlassian reports earnings on tap Thursday. So is Taiwan Semiconductor.S&P 500 futures rose nearly 0.6% vs. fair value. Dow futures jumped 0.8% against fair value, while Nasdaq 100 futures were up 0.6%. Keep in mind that stock futures were even stronger Tuesday, with the major averages booming at the open, before selling off.Dutch chip-equipment giant ASML reported a surprise earnings gain and better-than-expected revenue for the fourth quarter. ASML also hiked its dividend set a new stock buyback program. ASML is the leading maker of hugely expensive lithography machines, which help chipmakers make ever-smaller chips.Shares shot up 6.2% to 197.95 in early Wednesday stock market trading, suggesting a decisive gap-up above a 186.47 cup-base buy point.On Tuesday, ASML also gapped higher, rising to a record 189.38, but shares pulled back to close up about 3% to 186.38. Aggressive investors might have used 184.27 as an alternative entry just above a too-short handle.ASML's relative strength line rose above a short-term high Tuesday, though it is still well below its highs from the left side of the base.The RS line tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index. You want to see a stock's RS line lead or confirm a breakout by rising to at least short-term highs.Assuming ASML gaps higher in Wednesday's regular session, the RS line should confirm that move with a short-term high and a solid move toward longer-term highs.ASML is important because it's the first chip-equipment maker to report earnings for the latest quarter, really the first company from the broader chip sector to do so.IBD'S TAKE: Buying or holding a stock can be risky heading into an earnings report. Here's an earnings options strategy that can help you cash in on post-earnings stock gains, while minimizing the risk from a weak quarter. Here's how to apply that earnings options strategy with Atlassian.The collaboration software maker surged to 55.25 Tuesday morning, powering above a 53.55 cup-base entry. Shares then reversed sharply, briefly turning negative before closing with a 0.5% gain at 52.82. That was not a good afternoon for Atlassian. Still, the RS line is right at a short-term high and made up some ground vs. record highs from two months ago.Atlassian earnings are expected to rise 33% with revenue up 37%.Align briefly got to 268.17 on Tuesday, moving slightly past a 266.51 cup-base entry. Shares closed up 2.2% at 263.88. The Invisalign braces maker's RS line has been rising sharply in recent weeks, though it's still off its consolidation's peak.Scientific Games, which makes lottery-related products, edged up 0.5% to 54.10 on Tuesday after touching 55.15 intraday, eking past a 55.05 flat-base entry intraday.Taiwan Semi rose 2.5% to 42.23 on Tuesday, approaching a 42.67 buy point from a short cup-with-handle base. However, Taiwan Semi's RS line is still below a short-term high, let alone its late-November base.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Stocks Reverse Lower; Why A Pullback Now Seems More LikelyThese 4 Top Tech Stocks Hit Buy Points, But Only This One Held UpNew Highs Reverse Lower; Which Stocks Held Their Gains?False Leader Apple Loses Buy Point, But This iPhone Chip Stock Pops

71,ALGN,"Investors should be looking for leading stocks breaking out of bullish bases in volume, with their relative strength lines — which track stocks' performance vs. the S&P 500 index  — leading or confirming the breakout.Weibo (WB), Atlassian (TEAM), Match Group (MTCH) and Align Technology (ALGN) cleared buy points in proper bases Tuesday morning with RS lines that were already right at or close to at least short-term highs. But the stocks pulled back or turned negative with the broader market reversal. Only Weibo is in buy range now.X Take-Two Software Interactive (TTWO) also is near a buy point in a proper base with strong RS lines, though it also reversed lower.Weibo and Align Technology have best-possible 99 Composite Ratings, while Atlassian has a 98 Composite Rating. Match Group and Take-Two Interactive are at a solid 92.In recent weeks, many stocks have been hit buy points in lackluster volume with RS lines signaling the stock is just keeping pace with or falling behind the fast-rising S&P 500. Some of those breakouts have not fared well.Weibo, a top Chinese short-message social network, cleared a cup-with-handle base with a buy point of 122.31. Shares rose 1.4% to 123.19 in heavy volume on the stock market today after spiking to 128.37 intraday.Closing near session lows is not great action, but that's better than the general market, which reversed from strong gains to close lower, near the day's worst levels.Weibo's RS line edged past a short-term peak around the handle and neared the old all-time high on the left side of the consolidation. (The RS line is the blue line in the stock charts below.)Keep in mind that Weibo broke out of a late-stage base, which are less likely to succeed or be big winners than a first- or second-stage pattern.Weibo parent Sina (SINA) has been flirting with a double-bottom base buy point of 113.05, briefly crossing that level Friday. Sina fell 0.9% to 111.97 after climbing to 116.11 intraday. Its RS line is lagging more than Weibo's. Sina's RS line was trading right at very short-term highs.Atlassian, a collaboration software maker, is in a cup base with a 53.55 buy point, shot up to 55.25 intraday but pulled back to close with a 0.5% gain at 52.82.The RS line has moved above the short-term high around a pseudo-handle, providing some confirmation of the stock price action. The RS line is still lagging its November highs.Atlassian reports earnings on Thursday.IBD'S TAKE: With the market now in a confirmed rally for 100 days, it can be hard to see who are the true leading stocks and which are in the middle of the pack. See why IBD's relative strength line is so important.Match Group, which operates Match.com, Tinder and other dating sites and apps, is in a consolidation with a 32.97 buy point. That's 10 cents off the old intraday high on Nov. 8 following earnings, but the stock closed well below that peak that day. So as Match Group has consolidated and moved toward its old highs, the RS line has actually moved into new-high ground, bullish and uncommon for base-building stocks in the current market uptrend.Match.com briefly topped the buy point on Jan. 3 but closed lower. Shares ended Friday at 32.64.Match Group rose to 33.08 intraday but reversed to fall 3.8% at 31.40.Take-Two Interactive Software fell 2.85% to 113.96 intraday Tuesday, finding some support just above its 50-day line. As a result of Tuesday's action, the video game stock now has a handle for its consolidation, slightly lowering the potential buy point to 120.28.Take Two's RS line took a hit with Tuesday's sell-off. However, if the stock can break out strongly, the RS line could retake its short-term high around the handle.Align Technology, which makes the Invisalign transparent braces, tumbled from late November to just before Christmas. Shares have rebounded since then, building the right side of a consolidation with a 266.51 entry. Align rose 2.1% to 263.88 after reaching 268 intraday, briefly clearing that entry point.Align's RS line is moving higher, though still off its late November peak. It has risen above a very-short-term high. It also helps that the RS line had such outperformance in 2017, as Align was one of the big stock winners of the year.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Apple's Move Into Buy Range Left Much To Be Desired — And Then There's ThisFacebook Tumbles Below Buy Point; Why Breakout Was Never 'Meaningful'When Will You Know The Top Stocks' Big Runs Are Over?

The fund's average annual return was better than the S&P 500's over the trailing one, three, five and 10 years ending Dec. 31. That makes it eligible to earn an IBD Best Mutual Funds Award. Mutual funds that are members of that elite club are in the small minority of funds outperforming in all four time periods. In 2017, the fund was up 25.44% vs. 23.92% on average for midcap growth rivals tracked by Morningstar Direct and 21.83% for the S&P 500.The fund achieved its gain last year with help from leading stocks Align Technology (ALGN), Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO) and Red Hat (RHT), which are up 143%, 131% and 78% respectively since the start of 2017.MSCI (MSCI), Amazon (AMZN) and Facebook (FB) are additional leaders that helped to boost the fund, gaining 67%, 61% and 60%.MSCI is a member of the IBD 50 list of top-performing growth stocks. It's up 5% in this young year.IBD readers recognize that Amazon is near a buy point. Shares broke out Thursday but closed just below the flat base's buy point. Now the stock is back above its proper entry of 1213.51.Facebook, another IBD 50 stock, is also near a buy point — 184.35 in its case, having broken out from a new flat base last week.Brethour, Carlsen and Jones are with Kornitzer Capital Management. They subadvise the fund for Buffalo. The trio — who are ages 48, 49 and 53 — talked with IBD from their offices in Mission, Kansas, about how they hunt for winning stocks.List Of Mutual Fund Quarterly LeadersList Of Mutual Fund Six Month LeadersMF Category PerformanceClick Here To See All Articles In The Best Mutual Funds Performance ReportIBD: What's the central theme in your overall investment approach?Dave Carlsen: This is about seeking innovation in companies. We're looking for companies with innovation, with a new idea that's accepted in the marketplace and leads to shareholder wealth creation or a competitive advantage. We're looking for disruptive ideas that lead to significant share gain or the creation of a brand-new marketplace.We buy positions in growth companies that can grow and gain a competitive advantage regardless of the overall macro economy.IBD: The fund's outperformance over four time periods is rare. How has the fund achieved that consistency?Elizabeth Jones: We've been working together since 2004. That helps. And we each have our strengths and weaknesses. That diversification of strengths has led to more consistent results. When one of us has an interest in a stock that is out of favor, the others might choose stocks that are in favor.That minimizes our downside and maximizes our upside.IBD: Clay or Dave, would you add anything?Clay Brethour: Our process seeks companies that are beneficiaries of 26 secular growth trends. With those growth trends, they have a tailwind no matter what the macro economic situation looks like.IBD: What are some of those trends?Brethour: They're things like the aging demographics, the push for health care cost containment. We look for areas that benefit from durable trends and stay away from here-today-gone-tomorrow fads.IBD: As of your latest disclosure, what do you like about Facebook and what if any are your concerns?Carlsen: The growth in digital advertising impresses us. It's a big market that continues to disrupt. Google and Facebook are winning the lion's share of growth in digital advertising.The time that users spend on Facebook is remarkable, so advertisers like it. Revenues were up 45% in the September quarter vs. the prior year. That gives them pricing (power), which contributes to earnings growth.They're investing in short-form video content, which should build their community and drive consumer engagement higher. And with mobile revenue growth especially robust, Facebook remains well positioned.IBD: Why did you add to your Amazon stake recently?Jones: In Q2 we added to it. We gravitate to smaller companies but make exceptions for exceptional companies. And despite its size, Amazon is still growing rapidly, and it's probably the most innovative company in the world.We define value as translating an idea or innovation into a good or service that customers are willing to pay for. That's what (Amazon founder Jeff) Bezos has done. And he took a risk. He had to create an online marketplace with enough inventory and low enough prices to create value.He innovated in other ways. He needed Amazon Web Services to run his own infrastructure, and he monetized that by offering it to other companies. He realized he could provide content, so we got Amazon Prime Video, Music, Reading. And he wrapped that around the membership offering.We should have owned Amazon sooner. We're happy to own it now.IBD'S TAKE: Amazon is on IBD's exclusive Leaderboard list of top stocks. On Dec. 26, the company trumpeted its biggest holiday sales season ever.IBD: Align Technology (ALGN), the dental braces maker, has pulled back recently. As of your latest disclosure, if you still liked it, tell me why?Brethour: They dominate the clear aligner market and take market share from metal braces, and they continue to expand outside the U.S.(After) they got added to the S&P 500 (in June), they were one of the top four or five performing stocks in the S&P for the year, so some of the (recent) pullback is profit-taking.People underestimate the complexity of manufacturing a customized product (like Align's). And the company is aggressive about expanding into more complex treatment cases.We like it because it benefits everyone. It gives consumers a product they prefer. It helps dental and orthodontic practices. And it gives shareholders good returns and margins.IBD: Any concern about Red Hat's recent pullback after reporting third quarter results?Carlsen: The pullback was basically a case of (not meeting) high expectations. Still, its 20% quarterly (earnings per share) growth is not something you see from everyone in the tech sector. We expect it to continue.What we like is that Red Hat is in the right spot for the evolution of the cloud. They've built a big installed base of users for their Linux enterprise operating system on corporate servers and in the public and private cloud infrastructure. They allow a company's on-premises infrastructure to mesh with the public cloud infrastructure like Amazon's AWS or Microsoft's Azure. The public cloud is cheaper and more efficient for some uses. A company might keep its email on the public cloud, for example, but they may want to keep product development on-premise for security.Red Hat is positioned to bridge the gap between the private and public cloud, making innovation more efficient going forward.IBD: Why did Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO) drop recently after making a great run up?Jones: I don't think the pullback was anything in particular. A lot of growth stocks pulled back. Also, Electronic Arts (EA), another gaming company, made some changes to a new release, reducing the number of microtransactions that players buy on the side, and maybe that caused collateral damage to Take-Two and Activision (ATVI).But we don't believe those will impact the company's ability to meet our projections in the long run.Historically, the company is at a disadvantage by the boom-bust cycle in games releases. They'd have a lot of sales, then dramatic declines. But that's changing due to online gaming and multiplayer gaming, which are extending individual game lifetimes. Instead of new releases every five to seven years, the company is shifting to incremental releases delivered digitally, which have a higher margin and more opportunities for microtransactions, those side purchases by players that give them an advantage in a game. Those are why the stock has done well this year.In addition, the market anticipates two new releases next year. One will be Red Dead Redemption 2, which is highly anticipated.IBD: Why do you like MSCI (MSCI), which for example runs many indexes tracked by investors?Brethour: About 98% of their revenues are recurring. They have significant cash flow. And they only need a low capital expenditure to build their business going forward.They're a beneficiary of the shift to passive investing. As active managers, we are aware of that shift and want to seek ways to benefit from it. MSCI is a clear choice. Trillions of dollars are benchmarked to their indices.And now they're laying the groundwork to become the standard for ESG (environmental-, social- and governance-impact) investing. That should provide an additional avenue of growth going forward.IBD: Elizabeth, you are an M.D. How do you use that expertise as a manager for this fund?Jones: My experience in pricing medicine has given me unique insight to health care. I spend 70% to 75% of my time on health care in the fund, looking for things that offer consumers a good value. As Dave mentioned, we look for innovators. The key for them is having value. It's got to be a good deal for the consumer.With my background, I can assess that, especially in terms of the interface between doctors and patients.IBD: Dave and Clay, do either of you have unusual career trajectories?Carlsen: Like Clay, my career path has been pretty traditional.RELATED:Stock To Watch: Who Joins Apple, BofA On List Of New Buys By Top FundsIf You're Looking For Actionable Stocks, Check Our Stock Lists Page For Stocks Near Buy Zones, Stocks Hitting New Highs, Sector Leaders, Tech Leaders, IPO Leaders And MoreYou Need This Much Retirement Savings At Your Age And IncomeWhere To Find Income Without Taking Big Risks

90,ALGN,"A good economy had the odd effect of sinking the S&P 500 on Monday, amid concerns about higher prices and borrowing costs as central banks remove the crutches intended to support rebounds in the U.S. and abroad.X But for the individual companies in the S&P 500 index, quarterly results — that more granular measure of customer attitudes and one of the main drivers of any stock — are surpassing Wall Street forecasts at a particularly high rate, one not seen since the previous decade.The above-the-bar results have been helped, as ever, by tech, health care and financials, including Amazon (AMZN), Intel (INTC) UnitedHealth (UNH) and Mastercard (MA). But companies like DowDuPont (DWDP) and Eastman Chemical (EMN) have led suppliers of materials higher. Industrials — minus long-ailing General Electric (GE) — also look solid after a long drought.Among the 322 S&P 500 companies that have reported quarterly results so far this earnings season, 78% topped Wall Street estimates, according to Thomson Reuters data released Thursday. Eighty percent beat estimates for revenue.That's the best rate of above-estimate earnings since the third quarter of 2009, according to Thompson Reuters. For sales, it's the best since at least 2002.S&P 500 earnings are currently on track to deliver a 14.7% gain, with revenue up a robust 8%. That assumes that the remaining S&P 500 companies due to report will meet estimates.Analysts also appear optimistic about first-quarter earnings, even as the prospect of higher wages touches off investor fears of inflation, and economic growth stirs anxieties that the Federal Reserve will be more aggressive in raising interest rates to keep that growth honest.IBD'S TAKE: After the Thursday, Feb. 1, market action — and before Friday's and Monday's market drubbings — IBD changed its market outlook to ""uptrend under pressure"" from ""confirmed uptrend,"" the equivalent of a green light turning yellow. Make sure to read The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market's prevailing trend, so you'll know when it makes sense to be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.Still, the global recovery has brought new demand for technology, energy and infrastructure. And a rebound in oil prices has boosted demand for equipment of all kinds, lifting industrials and, in turn, demand for the suppliers of chemical materials.In the stock market today, the S&P 500 index, Dow industrials and Nasdaq composite sold off yet again as Treasury yields hit multiyear highs. Stocks rallied strongly to start 2018 in part on expectations for strong, broad earnings growth.Within Thomson Reuters' Materials sector, which includes companies like DowDuPont and Eastman, 94% of companies have beat on earnings for the most recent quarter — the highest percentage of all 11 industry sectors measured by the firm. Eighty-one percent of companies in the Materials segment have beat on revenue.Even as the troubles deepen at General Electric, which has weighed on growth in the industrial sector as it tries to focus more on aviation, power and health care — that segment overall has remained solid. Seventy-four percent have beat on earnings, 81% on revenue.GE earnings per share slid 41% in the fourth quarter. It faces an SEC investigation, and one analyst said the company could be removed from the Dow.Within the technology sector, 85% of technology companies have beaten earnings estimates, led by companies like Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), CA (CA), Intel (INTC) and Xilinx (XLNX). Ninety percent beat on revenue, amid strong growth in semiconductors and semiconductor equipment.More tech companies are also bringing in bigger businesses as consumers.""You're seeing a transition from consumer-based to business-based, which is a big driver,"" Aurelio said. ""So you're seeing things like data-center growth.""In the Consumer-Discretionary category, where around three quarters of companies have produced above-the-bar results, Amazon (AMZN) last week turned out earnings far ahead of analyst expectations, helped by the GOP's new tax law and the broader migration to e-commerce and smart devices.""Our 2017 projections for Alexa were very optimistic, and we far exceeded them,"" CEO Jeff Bezos said in a statement at that time. ""We don't see positive surprises of this magnitude very often — expect us to double down.""Earnings from 89% of companies in Thomson Reuters' Health Care segment — which includes biotech, pharmaceuticals and health care services — came in above analyst views; 91% beat on revenue.UnitedHealth, the nation's largest health insurer, was among them. But the companies that surpassed earnings estimates by the widest margin were pharma distributor Cardinal Health (CAH), ResMed (RMD) and Align Technology (ALGN), the maker of Invisalign dental braces.Those earnings follow a 2017 that BMO analyst Matt Borsch (who follows managed care companies, hospitals and other care providers) characterized as mediocre, in terms of volume — or the number of inpatient admissions, outpatient procedures, and doctor and emergency-room visits.But more of that volume, he said, has been packed into the end of the fourth quarter, as more people meet their deductible on their high-deductible plans, which have become increasingly common.""When you have the high-deductible health plans, you generally have a pretty strong dynamic of people, on average, increasing their utilization significantly after they've met the deductible, and therefore that is why you see that more late in the year,"" he said.The companies who have reported so far, largely, aren't benefiting from low expectations, either. Expectations have remained relatively similar for earnings this quarter compared with quarters past and were a tad higher for revenue, Aurelio said.As investors make their way through fourth-quarter results and the market's volatility, the outlook for the first quarter remains not so bad.""Typically as you get closer to the next earnings season, the expectations decrease,"" Aurelio said. ""So we'd see the growth rate for Q1 normally drop, and it's been going up.""At the beginning of the year, he said, expectations were for 12.2% earnings growth in the first quarter. On Thursday, growth expectations were for 17.8%. That's despite lowered guidance from Apple (AAPL) and many iPhone chip suppliers.""So that's a pretty bullish signal,"" he said.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:The Big Picture: Will Stocks Repeat The 2011 Bear Sell-Off?Big Wage Gain Sinks Stocks, Bonds: 3 Reasons To Doubt The DataDid Congress, Trump Just Crush The Stock Market Rebound?Will Brokerages Receive Fresh Lift From Tax Reform, Rate Hikes?ObamaCare Exchange Enrollment Shows Surprise Gain, Despite Trump's Attacks

At 165.94, the largest company on the Nasdaq by market cap is now 4% below its 50-day moving average, which flattened out last week.

As seen on a weekly chart, it continues to hug its slowly rising 10-week moving average (painted in red in all IBD and MarketSmith charts).On Monday, the Nasdaq notched its third distribution day, or instance of heavy professional selling, and its second in four sessions. Keep track of the distribution count for both the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 by reading The Big Picture column on a daily basis. When the current outlook for the market changes, you'll have a good strategy and motivation to take action to either sell stocks and reduce exposure, or hold on to your positions.At this point, a new investor in Apple shares has to decide where to draw the line in the sand. When a stock has gained 10% or more following a sound breakout, a good rule of thumb is to sell shares for a small profit to prevent a complete wipeout of gains. The stock can always be bought back when market conditions improve.From a longer-term point of view, however, Apple is still acting just fine.On Jan. 6, 2017, the iPhone, iPad and digital services giant broke out of a first-stage cup with handle at 118.12.

The S&P SmallCap 600 rose just 14.5%.Over that ascent, Apple survived normal-looking sell-offs that sent shares temporarily below the 50-day moving average in June and September. Notice on a long-term weekly chart how Apple did not venture too far below the 10-week moving average, which moves in similar form with the 50-day on a daily chart.Elsewhere in the stock market, investors sought to accumulate shares in select names in business and medical software.

The stock closed below its 50-day moving average on Monday for the first time since a breakout past a 24.53 buy point in a flat base in June 2017, marking a key sell signal.The homebuilder reported a 27% rise in Q4 profit to 85 cents a share, matching the consensus view. Revenue rose 12% to $2.79 billion, missing the Thomson Reuters estimate.A large number of Pulte's industry peers have also slid sharply below their 50-day lines, including NVR (NVR), LGI Homes (LGIH) and Toll Bros. (TOL). But a few reversed nicely off their lows, a good sign.After a healthy breakout and substantial price run, a sharp undercut below the 50-day line and failure to recover back to the support line is a key IBD defensive sell rule to help you preserve your profits.As a two-day Federal Reserve meeting on interest rate policy began on Tuesday, bond traders did not seem to actively seek bargains even after the recent sell-off in Treasuries. The yield on the benchmark U.S. 10-year bond is currently at 2.71%.The 3-month Treasury paper has a yield of 1.42% and the 2-year note a yield of 2.12%; thus, the yield curve continues to maintain a positive slope.The Building sector ranks No. 3 among 33 sectors as ranked by mid- and long-term relative price performance as of the latest IBD Weekly print edition.

That would mark the biggest year-over-year increase since a 72% gain in the first quarter of 2015.In the prior four quarters, Illumina showed a 5% EPS increase, declines of 11% and 5%, and a 14% gain.Illumina, down just 0.5% to 240.40 in light turnover, has rallied in steady stair-stepping fashion after breakouts past a 12-week flat base at 189.58 on Aug. 2, 2017, and from a base-on-base breakout past 214.44 on Nov. 22.(Follow Saito-Chung on Twitter at @IBD_DChung for additional commentary and analysis of breakouts, growth stocks, and financial markets.)RELATED:Can You Really Spot Major Market Tops?

131,ALGN,"X Since 1963, the S&P 500 delivered 19 years in which it rallied more than 15%. But each year following those big gains averaged a more modest 7.5% advance. That said, money managers and strategists still see plenty of investment opportunities in 2018.And some seem to already be at hand. Scarcely three days into the new year and the Dow has charged ahead 1.4%, in the process topping 25,000 for the first time ever.But some of the best gains for the full year may come in overseas stock markets and in value equities both in the U.S. and abroad. (Click here for a timeline and detailed chart of 2017's remarkable stock market.)That rotation of big portfolios into more foreign stocks is expected to take place despite economic uncertainty due to the U.K.'s Brexit and escalating tensions with Russia's Vladimir Putin and China's Xi Jinping, not to mention North Korea's nuclear threats.Two big reasons are the prospect of faster economic growth abroad and cheaper valuations for many foreign equities. GDP growth will likely continue strong in both China and Europe, where European Central Bank (ECB) President Mario Draghi says monetary stimulus will continue until at least September.Special Report: 2018 Personal Finance Action Plan & 2017 Stock Market ReviewThe U.S. economy looks positive too. Investors are heartened by incoming Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, and they're jazzed by a drum roll of moves by President Trump, including tax reform, opening the way for oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, throttling back on federal regulations and withdrawing from the Paris climate accord.But with many stocks up sharply from a year ago, investment strategists and fund managers expect more modest stock price gains in 2018. The S&P 500's 2017 return was more than double the big-cap bogey's 8.50% average annual gain over the past 10 years. The Nasdaq composite index shot up 29.64% and the Dow Jones industrials gained 25.08%.Align Technology (ALGN), part of the Nasdaq and a member of the IBD 50 list of top-performing growth stocks, jumped 131% in 2017. The company is known for its computer-assisted design approach to straightening teeth.Banking giant JPMorgan Chase (JPM), a key cog in the Dow, rose 24% in 2017. IBD Markets Editor Juan Carlos Arancibia analyzes 2017's top-performing stocks in a separate article.Against this backdrop, money pros say some of the best opportunities lie in non-U.S. stocks. And in both the U.S. and abroad, they see good potential in value-oriented stocks, including cyclical stocks whose performance swings up and down with economic conditions.""Stocks will be better than bonds once again in 2018,"" said David Joy, chief market strategist for broker and financial advisor Ameriprise Financial (AMP). ""And we like international markets better than domestic. That includes developed markets in the eurozone but not the U.K., and it includes Japan.""Joy cites three reasons why foreign stocks may shine. ""Economic growth relative to potential growth appears to be stronger in those international markets than in the U.S. even though the U.S. is doing well,"" he said. ""And central banks in those (foreign) geographies will be more accommodative than in the U.S., where the Federal Reserve as everyone knows is raising interest rates.""The third reason: Valuations. U.S. stocks as a group have grown expensive, Joy says. Other markets are more attractively valued. So there's more upside potential than in U.S. stocks overall.But Joy added, ""We do think U.S. stocks will go higher."" Ameriprise currently forecasts that the S&P 500 will hit 2865 in 2018, up 7% from its 2673.61 level at year-end 2017.Joseph Davis, Vanguard's global chief economist and head of its investment strategy group, says Vanguard expects the lowest returns for U.S. equities in roughly a decade. His group expects 4% to 6% annual gains for U.S. stocks in the next five years.Ameriprise forecasts 3.0% U.S. GDP growth in excess of inflation in 2018. Before Congress passed tax reform, Ameriprise was predicting 2.4%. China's pace should remain around 6.5%. The eurozone's economy should grow around 2.2% vs. 2.1% in 2017.As for interest rates Ameriprise, among others, expects the Fed to continue raising rates. That ""will be a lid on earnings multiples for U.S. corporations and may bring some (multiples) down,"" Joy said. Research firm Action Economics sees the fed funds rate around 2.12% by the end of 2018, up from its 1.25% to 1.50% band since June 2017.U.S. tax reform is a wild card. ""It should add incrementally to earnings growth and economic growth,"" Joy said. ""It should provide a little tailwind to stocks.""U.S. joblessness should drop to 3.6% by the end of 2018, the lowest rate since 1969, Ameriprise says. The unemployment rate was 4.1% in November 2017.David Polak, equity investment specialist at Capital Group, the parent of American Funds, sees investment opportunities in several geographic markets. Asia and the U.S. remain leading sites of technology innovators, he says.Manufacturers of logic chips are one group of innovators. Industry consolidation has left four key players, including Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) and California-based Intel (INTC). Fifteen years ago, there were 25.""Taiwan Semi and Intel are dominant,"" Polak said. ""Consolidation has left the space more disciplined, which should lead to more visibility of earnings and more pricing power.""Another Asia stock he likes is Japan's Murata Manufacturing. ""Their ceramic capacitors are crucial components for smartphones, but relatively inexpensive, so manufacturers can stuff phones with them without impacting their margins much,"" he said.Since the capacitors are used in Apple iPhones as well as Samsung Galaxy and other Android phones, ""It's a way to invest in the growth element without having to bet on which phone will do better,"" Polak said.In gaming, he likes the way Japan's Nintendo (NTDOY) has diversified its addressable market. ""They took their intellectual property away from just hardware,"" Polak said. ""You used to have to play their games only on their hardware. Now it's available on multiple devices.""Then there's Tencent (TCEHY), China's leading provider of messaging and mobile gaming services. Tencent also owns the popular WeChat app.For Polak, a key Tencent trait is its leadership in China's mobile payments services, enabling consumers to use smartphones to pay bills and make online purchases.Peter Bourbeau, co-manager of $9.3 billion ClearBridge Large Cap Growth (SBLYX) sees opportunities among U.S. stocks but says it's time to switch from FAANG stocks because their price run-ups have left less room to rise. The ClearBridge fund is on track to becoming a 2018 IBD Best Mutual Funds Award winner after outperforming the S&P 500 in 2017 as well as in the trailing three, five and 10 years.Schlumberger (SLB) should benefit from a bottoming among energy stocks, Bourbeau says. Oil and gas service companies have regained pricing power, he adds.""SLB currently generates incremental margins of 60%-plus (the highest in its history) and is benefiting from its OneStim U.S. joint venture with Weatherford International (WFT) for pressure pumping,"" he said. ""SLB is the only global service company that is using its balance sheet to invest alongside its customers.""Among health care stocks, Bourbeau likes Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN). He calls it ""a leader in ultrarare genetic disease treatments. The company recently cleared the decks with new management and a refocused research and development profile. Alexion also received additional approvals for its lead compound Soliris for (treating other maladies)."" Solaris also was being tested for new ways of being administered.Within the financial services stock group, he likes Visa (V). ""Visa is making very good progress on its recent acquisition of Visa Europe with synergies and client engagement,"" he said. ""Although incremental margins are extremely strong, Visa continues to innovate within its core debit/credit portfolio as well as (creating) new ways to integrate with merchants and cardholders.""What about some of the big stocks that padded his mutual fund's recent gains? FAANG stock Amazon (AMZN), up 56% in 2017, was among his top holdings as of Sept. 30. So was Microsoft (MSFT), which rose 38% for the year.""Amazon continues to execute its plan of disrupting adjacent verticals and margin-rich opportunities,"" Bourbeau said. ""It continues to focus on marketplace, Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Prime. The company has a huge opportunity outside the U.S. and will focus on countries like India, which is more hospitable to Western technology companies. We still see a large opportunity in AWS as we are in early stages of a generational shift to how technology is created and consumed.""Regarding Microsoft, Bourbeau said, ""We expect more of the same strong growth trends for Microsoft as the software maker helps its clients move workloads to the cloud. Its Azure cloud business is at a $20 billion run rate (in sales for 2018) and growing double digits. The company continues to focus on partnerships with service providers and competing technology, a departure from the strategy of previous management.""Celgene (CELG), another top holding, is an inexpensive stock, he said, adding that Celgene has a strategy for coping with the patent expiration of its flagship product, the cancer drug Revlimid, in the middle of the next decade. ""The biotechnology company should have 19 late-stage clinical readouts in 2019,"" he said. ""Cash continues to build and we expect some business development opportunities or acquisitions to further bolster its clinical pipeline.""MORE IBD COVERAGE FOR YOU:2018 Stock Market Forecasts: Read The Predictions For Top Stocks And IndustriesHow Tax Reform Impacts Your Tax Bracket And RateYou Need This Much Retirement Savings At Your Age And IncomeAI In Business: This Is What The Future HoldsBefore You Buy Bitcoin, Read This

136,ALGN,"Share-price gains by a combination of stocks with promise and stocks with solid earnings records have helped put $2.2 billion AB Discovery Growth Fund (CHCLX) among the top mutual funds.Big share-price gainers include Beigene (BGNE) and Loxo Oncology (LOXO) — both yet to post annual profits. More seasoned holdings with solid earnings include Arista Networks (ANET), Align Technology (ALGN), Grubhub (GRUB) and Copart (CPRT).Discovery Growth has joined the ranks of top mutual funds by outperforming 93% of its midcap growth peers tracked by Morningstar Inc. and the S&P 500 in 2017. The fund has also topped 94% of its direct rivals as well as the big-cap bogey this year going into Wednesday and 90% of them along with the benchmark over the past three years.Bruce Aronow, the management team's chief investment officer, says the secret sauce for AB Discovery Growth Fund's recent outperformance has two ingredients. One is ""getting fundamentals right,"" he said. ""That means identifying faster growing companies. The other is identifying companies that can outgrow consensus expectations, that can enjoy positive earnings revisions and surprises.""This top mutual fund uses fundamental research and quantitative modeling to find the companies it wants. ""That quant model triggers off such factors as earnings revisions, momentum, earnings surprises."" The fund wants companies whose growth potential is underappreciated and that post earnings surprises that lure more investors.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseArista makes cloud networking software and hardware. One thing that Aronow likes about Arista is that it does not have to try to make old technology solve new customer challenges. ""Our thesis is that Arista has better solutions to go after the data center market,"" Aronow said. ""It was designed from the ground up to target that, whereas legacy companies like Cisco Systems (CSCO) and Juniper Networks (JNPR) have to live with legacy code and technology, which makes it tougher for them to be as nimble as Arista.""Not having to adapt old technology has many benefits, Aronow says. ""Arista's solutions are more scalable,"" he added. ""It offers orders of magnitude better economies. It's been built to focus on what the market needs. That takes some bells and whistles out of the equation. But they provide solutions that the market values.""Arista's three-year earnings per share growth rate is 49%.

Check out IBD's easy-to-read Stock Checkup page to see how Arista's traits compare to its rivals'. Align Technology is another disruptive holding. In its case, the market it has upset is the one producing orthodontic braces. ""They make Invisalign, which is different from the traditional wire and bracket (orthodontic) solution. Invisalign holds big appeal for adults, who don't want to march around with metal braces as badges of honor. So there's a growing demand from adults.""Align has strengthened its growth by learning to provide aligners for increasingly complex cases, Aronow says. It is also expanding its market by developing products for older teenagers, not just adults.About 20% of North Americans needing orthodontic devices use clear aligners, Aronow says. Invisalign has about an 85% share of that market, he adds.Aronow thinks that clear aligners' market share can at least double. And with just a roughly 10% penetration internationally, ""there's an even better runway there,"" he said.EPS went from negative 2% five quarters ago to gains of 18%, 37%, 60% and 100% in the four most recent stanzas.Takeout food ordering platform Grubhub is an example of a company that benefits from being a first mover. ""This is a classic network effect model,"" Aronow said. He added, ""The model that has the most restaurants and diners continues to grow as a competitive leader because restaurants want broad reach (to the greatest number of prospective customers) and diners want variety.""Grubhub's acquisitions and alliances reinforce its network effect. Among those announced or completed in 2017 were its purchase of Eat24 from Yelp, OrderUp and food-ordering firm Foodler and its Dash delivery service. Grubhub also entered a partnership with Groupon to bring food delivery to Groupon customers across the U.S.Grubhub also agreed to integrate online ordering from all of its restaurants onto Yelp's platform and to make Grubhub the exclusive food-delivery provider for Yelp visitors in exchange for a referral transaction fee.And in February of this year, Yum! Brands said it would buy a 3% stake in Grubhub. Grubhub also said it would provide KFC and Taco Bell with online ordering, pickup and delivery services at their U.S. restaurants.Copart auctions off vehicles that have been declared total losses by insurers. Their inventory is up because more drivers are distracted by smartphones and because repair costs have soared. ""As vehicles have more sophisticated content in the form of sensors and electronics, the cost to repair more vehicles gets increasingly hard to justify,"" Aronow said.Copart share prices have not been hurt badly in the broad market's recent sell-off. Its shares are up about 68% in the past 12 months.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE:Hot Stocks Light A Fire Under AB Discovery GrowthYou Need This Much Retirement Savings At Your Age And Income

138,ALGN,"Buffalo Discovery Fund (BUFTX) turns to market disrupters like Align Technology (ALGN) and long-term secular trends in shaping its investment strategy, which has landed the fund among the top mutual funds in the third annual IBD Best Mutual Funds Awards.The $1.9 billion fund has been led by Clay Brethour, Dave Carlsen and Elizabeth Jones since 2004. ""We seek the early identification of attractively priced, financially strong, well-managed companies,"" Carlsen said. ""We take a patient approach to stock selection, looking for stock opportunities where long-term growth is underappreciated or where there's been an overreaction in the near term.""The approach has paid off for the top-performing mutual fund. It has beaten the S&P 500 in each of the past one, three, five and 10 years. In doing so it won IBD Best Mutual Funds Awards in both the Growth Fund and Midcap Fund categories.Over the last 10- and 15-year periods the fund has turned in average annual returns of 13.6% and 14.7%. These gains have handily surpassed those of midcap growth funds tracked by Morningstar, which have posted 9.6% and 11.4% returns for the same periods. Where does that put it among top mutual funds? Buffalo Discovery's 10- and 15-year annual average returns ranked among the top 3% and 2% of Morningstar midcap growth funds.In 2017, Buffalo Discovery returned 25.4%. It earned a top-three ranking in the IBD Best Mutual Funds 2018 Awards list for midcap funds.Innovation is essential for inclusion in the Buffalo Discovery portfolio. ""We've found that our focus on innovation is one of the best ways to hitch our wagon to share gainers and market disrupters,"" Carlsen said. ""We believe these companies will be the most likely to reap the rewards of the big secular growth trends.""Carlsen's team uses secular trends to home in on worthy portfolio candidates. ""The secular trends provide a growth tailwind and narrow our stock picking universe to a durable growth universe that we believe should grow faster and have less cyclicality than the overall market,"" he said.

Technology, industrials and health care were its three largest sector weightings.Top holding Align Technology has been a mainstay in the portfolio for much of Carlsen's tenure. The stock has surged more than 4,000% since the maker of Invisalign was added to the portfolio in 2005, and has climbed into large-cap territory. The Buffalo Discovery team still sees plenty of room to run. ""We believe robust growth is sustainable over the intermediate to long term,"" Carlsen said. ""Less than 15% of the orthodontic market has converted from metal braces to clear aligners. The company has also been focused on driving down the cost of its product resulting in tremendous growth internationally.""In Q4, Invisalign case shipments spiked 34% on a year-over-year basis.Carlsen sees the fund's stake in Nevro (NVRO) benefiting from an aging population and a government push away from opioids for pain management. ""The company makes high-frequency spinal cord stimulation (SCS) devices that treat chronic back and leg pain more effectively and with better clinical outcomes than competing SCS devices from traditional players,"" he said. ""It has rapidly gained nearly 15% market share and remains well positioned for further share gains and rapid growth. Continued product innovation like smaller footprint devices should expand the market and recent full-body MRI approval in Europe bodes well for future U.S. approval.""Xylem (XYL), the No. 2 holding of the fund, enables municipal and industrial customers to manage water systems more efficiently. ""They've incorporated sensors and analytics to proactively provide alerts when a problem requires attention, before it breaks and causes costly downtime,"" Carlsen said. ""They have also incorporated intelligence on pumps to use less energy and boost efficiency. The company should have earnings growth in the midteens over the next several years.""Shares of Xylem are up 50% from a year ago.In the tech space, the Buffalo Discovery team is bullish on the video game publisher Electronic Arts (EA). ""Video game companies have enjoyed a strong year as investors realize the positive business model effects of downloadable games and in-game content,"" Carlsen said. ""Emerging online player networks should help further expand the user base as players connect from around the world.""Electronic Arts has seen its stock price rise 43% over the past year.Buffalo Discovery bought shares of Praxair (PX) in 2015. The industrial gas supplier was a top 10 holding at year-end. ""It is a premier operator and serves a consumable (product) to a diverse set of industrial customers,"" Carlsen said. ""This tends to insulate it from negative flash points in the economy. Its strategy is to grow profitably regardless of the macroeconomic environment. The name brings some nice stability to our portfolio.""Shares of Praxair are up 31% versus a year ago.With an eye on its current holdings, the Buffalo Discovery team remains on the lookout for opportunities to add innovators to the portfolio.""We believe the market frequently overreacts to near-term events, which will create opportunities to buy premier stocks at attractive prices,"" Carlsen said.""The market volatility experienced this past February is the most recent example.

""While passage of tax reform may provide mid-single digit upside to the S&P 500, we also estimate that equity allocations for most investor types are near historical highs, potentially leaving them less willing to increase allocations to U.S. equities further.

215,ALGN,"Another quiet session for the major stock indexes Wednesday was far from quiet below the surface.XThe Nasdaq composite was up 0.3%, the S&P 500 added 0.1% and the Dow Jones industrial average fell fractionally. Volumes on the NYSE and Nasdaq were tracking slightly lower than Tuesday's levels in the stock market today.Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Wal-Mart (WMT) and Merck (MRK) outperformed in the Dow, with gains of more than 1%.

Managed-care firms and superregional banks lagged.Bullishness among newsletter writers rose in the latest week to 64.4, up from 63.5 the prior week, according to the latest day from Investors Intelligence. It was the fifth straight reading in the ""danger zone"" of this contrarian indicator, and up significantly from an 11-month low of 47.1 in early September. Just like extreme bearish readings have been seen at market bottoms in the past, excessive optimism has been seen near tops in the past.The Nasdaq composite is showing some signs of institutional selling but not much.

An earnings miss at Match was offset by a strong sales outlook.On the downside, Snap (SNAP) plunged 17.5% on a sales miss and weak user growth figures.

241,ALGN,"The $2 billion AB Discovery Growth Fund (CHCLX) is in a strong rebound, shaking off a tough 2016, thanks to leading stocks like Grubhub (GRUB), up 44% so far this year; Align Technology (ALGN), up 95%; and Planet Fitness (PLNT), up 31%.XThe fund's 22.65% gain over the 12 months going into Wednesday outperformed 88% of its midcap growth rivals tracked by Morningstar Direct and the S&P 500's 19.63%. That was a big step up from calendar 2016's 4.78% return, which beat only 45% of its peers and was less than half the S&P 500's 11.96% advance.Last year and even in much of 2014 and 2015, many investors were driven by skittishness mostly into value-oriented stocks and defensive names, says lead manager Bruce Aronow. ""Those were strong performers,"" Aronow said. ""But they tend not to be strongly represented in the (AB Discovery Growth) portfolio.""This year the market has rotated back into the types of growth names Aronow and his teammates prefer. And stocks they like have more room to run, Aronow says. ""Valuations of companies in the profile we look for, being out of favor before, are quite compelling now,"" Aronow said. ""Even with strong performance year to date, they are still at a discount to their long-term average.""The fund's other managers are N. Kumar Kirpalani, Samantha Lau and Wen-Tse Tseng.Diversification is another key aspect of the managers' overall approach. And the managers limit their sector weightings to plus or minus 800 basis points of their bench mark's. ""Over time, we're usually within half of that range,"" Aronow said.He added, ""Idiosyncratic stock performance is more important to us than sector allocation. We are bottom-up investors. By constraining sector bets, we don't give back outperformance by individual stocks.""The fund's four biggest sectors are packed in a tight range from weightings of 23% for producer durables to 17% for health care. Technology is the third-largest sector, at 19%.The fund began to buy its current stake in Grubhub in January. ""We believe this is a winner-take-most opportunity,"" Aronow said. ""The network with the most choices will attract the most diners. Restaurants will favor the network with the most diners.""Earnings per share grew 45% and 13% the past two quarters. Aronow does not mind the slowdown. ""They're the leader in online ordering. They've been investing to solidify their position. We're fine with that. It solidifies their opportunity to sustain high levels of growth for a long time.""Aronow gives a thumbs up to investments like Grubhub's acquisition of rival Foodler and its even more recent partnerships with Yelp and Groupon. In addition, the low consumer penetration of food-delivery services gives Grubhub a long runway, Aronow says.Grubhub is also on Leaderboard — IBD's premium service that spotlights play-by-play of top stocks.Align Technology is the No. 1 rated stock in IBD's Medical-Products industry group thanks to such traits as a highest-possible 99 Composite Rating from IBD and an expected 46% increase in EPS this year.IBD'S TAKE: You can compare Align Technology's other technical and fundamental strengths with its rivals' at IBD's easy-to-use Stock Checkup tool.Align makes transparent orthodontic tooth aligners. Consumers usually pay out-of-pocket for the devices, so the company benefits from a growing economy. Most customers are adults. Aronow sees Align expanding into a teen market and foreign markets. He also expects the percentages of users in both of those markets to expand.""And Align will put up healthy, consistent growth as they grow the complexity of (dental) cases they can correct for,"" Aronow said.Discovery Growth Fund has boosted its stake in Planet Fitness in recent portfolio disclosures. The stock is appealing because ""it is the ultimate unAmazonable retail story,"" Aronow said. Consumers can't exercise online.The stock is also appealing because ""it is very early in its growth runway,"" Aronow said. ""They have about 1,300 units, with the potential to more than triple that count.""The company is benefiting from a virtuous cycle. ""As the leading national brand, they can put more advertising dollars behind their brand,"" Aronow said. ""That drives new member growth, which fuels more advertising.""In addition, Aronow calls the fitness center chain very capital efficient because many of its centers are owned by franchisees.The stock happens to be ranked No. 1 in IBD's Leisure-Services industry group.Grubhub, Align Technology and Planet Fitness are all members of the IBD 50 list of stocks that have strong relative price strength and fundamentals.RELATED:Hot Stocks Light A Fire Under AB Discovery Growth FundYou Need This Much Retirement Savings At Your Age And IncomeThis Tax-Rule Change Could KO Your Retirement Account

258,ALGN,"Resistance and support are technical factors chart readers use to describe certain trends affecting a stock's price. Resistance holds a stock below a certain level and blocks it from going higher. Support keeps the stock above a certain price, and prevents the stock from breaking down.Here we will focus on resistance.Resistance is generally the effect of profit taking. Institutional investors may be committed to booking profits at a certain level, for instance. Every time the stock reaches that level, sellers step in and overwhelm buying demand, sending the stock price lower.You can see this again and again in many different ways in stock charts. A stock rally often peaks at a particular level. The stock falls back, then periodically rises to 'test resistance' at that level. When sellers step in, the stock generally falls back again into another period of price consolidation.Align Technology (ALGN) met resistance near the 65 level from January 2014 to March 2016. Priceline Group (PCLN) faced resistance around the 1,375 to 1,475 level for 28 months to July 2016.IBD'S TAKE: To stay on top of the market direction, read IBD's The Big Picture column, a key source that signals when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.But you will find that, once a stock pierces above resistance — especially when the stock has been contained for a long period of time — the release quite often marks a point, beyond which, sellers step back and unfettered demand drives the beginning of a winning stock rally. In these cases, the points at which the resistance is most likely to be overtaken is oftentimes marked by a buy point.These long periods of stasis, followed by breakouts are often signature charts for stocks executing turnarounds or which are in a recovering cyclical industry.Resistance can also occur over shorter periods. Look at Grubhub's (GRUB) May-to-July struggle to break through the 47 level, or JPMorgan's (JPM) ongoing six-month battle to beat resistance just above 94. Even Apple (AAPL), in its eight-week fight to gain ground above a 156.75 buy point, demonstrates a form of resistance.Sometimes resistance occurs not at a particular price point or range, but along an upward or downward sloping trend line. China-based YY (YY) provided a good recent example. The stock peaked at just above 96 in September 2014. An investor looking at the chart can draw a straight line along subsequent peaks marking resistance near 82 in June 2015 and near 64 in April 2016. It continued with resistance in October 2016 near 57 (1) and, finally, around 52 in March this year (2).The final peak began a seven-week cup base with a buy point at 51.94. The stock had climbed 38% before starting the base. Following the trend line down, you can see a 4% pop in rising trade on May 2, as the stock topped the line of resistance.The stock gathered momentum in a four-day run that broke past the buy point and left the stock up 5% in strong trade for the week ended May 12. After the breakout, resistance was eliminated and YY's 10-week moving average became a clear touchstone of support, cradling the stock's run. Now an IBD 50 name, YY's hares have gained as much as 59% since that breakout, and 110% since the start of the year.RELATED:Young Chinese Internet Stock Rebounds From Support At Crucial Support LevelBest Chinese Stocks To Buy & WatchGetting Started With IBDIBD Investor Research Tools How To Follow The Market: Read Stock Market TodayUnderstanding Stock Market Trends: The Big Picture

260,ALGN,"Medtronic (MDT) shares sank early Tuesday after the maker of medical devices reported fiscal first-quarter sales that lagged Wall Street estimates, though adjusted profit beat by 4 cents a share.In early trading on the stock market today, Medtronic dropped 2.1% to close at 81.76. Shares fell well below a flat base that began forming in late June with an 89.82 buy point. Meanwhile, IBD's ninth-ranked Medical-Products industry group advanced 0.6%.Medtronic reported $7.39 billion in sales, up 3%, but that fell short of the consensus of analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research for $7.45 billion. Adjusted earnings of $1.12 per share beat the $1.08 view and grew 9%.Medtronic's restorative therapies and minimally invasive therapies businesses contributed to the revenue miss, RBC analyst Glenn Novarro wrote in a note to clients. But Novarro kept his outperform rating on the company.Restorative therapies include work on the spine and brain, as well as pain management. Sales in that unit rose 2% to $1.81 billion, but missed views for $1.84 billion. Minimally invasive therapies include surgical and monitoring/recovery; this business grew 3% to $2.49 billion but missed by $28 million.IBD'S TAKE: Medtronic has an IBD Composite Rating of 66 out of a best-possible 99, meaning it outperforms two-thirds of all stocks in terms of key growth metrics. Still, it lags top performers like Abiomed (ABMD) and Align Technology (ALGN), which have CRs of 99. Visit IBD Stock Checkup for a closer look at strong performers.Cardiac and vascular sales advanced 5% to $2.65 billion, but were a tad light. Medtronic noted that adoption of its CoreValve Evolut Pro platform in the U.S. helped drive high-30% growth, excluding foreign exchange rates, in sales of its transcatheter heart-valve replacements.Diabetes tech sales, though, fell 1% to $449 million, missing by $25 million. The group was temporarily affected by a limited supply of some glucose sensors, Medtronic said in a news release.Medtronic reaffirmed its full-year guidance for 4%-5% sales growth and 9%-10% adjusted EPS growth, excluding foreign exchange rates. But it cut views for diabetes sales to 1%-4% growth from its prior 10%-12% outlook. Its cardiac forecast was boosted to 5.5%-7% growth.RELATED:This Robotics Player Neared 1,000, Then Toppled — Here's WhyRobot-Surgeon Maker Bests Q2 Sales, Profits ViewsThis Drug Bellwether's Sales Miss Actually Bodes Well For The Sector

298,ALGN,"U.S. stock indexes stepped backward midday Friday after Q2 GDP results matched the Street's expectations and consumer data showed some bright spots.XThe Nasdaq and S&P 500 lost 0.2%. The blue chip Dow Jones industrial average was flat. Volume in the stock market today was running lower than in the previous session.

301,ALGN,"Last week's column reviewed some swing trading principles for handling a sideways market. This week we'll focus on some real-time examples from IBD's SwingTrader.First, it should be noted that there was limited activity in June because of the sideways action of the market. Only seven positions were on the current trades list throughout June and two of those were profits held from May. Avoid overtrading in a sideways market, otherwise even small losses can damage your portfolio if you have too many of them.Another key strategy used throughout the month was taking profits quickly and not letting good trades go negative. Align Technology (ALGN) was one of the few stocks that hit a 5% profit goal and in that case half profits were taken June 2. It was on its way to a 10% gain but stopped short and quickly reversed. Rather than hope for a bounce, the remaining shares were removed to keep more than a 5% average gain for the trade.In order to avoid losses, that might also mean getting rid of stocks due to a lack of progress. Taylor Morrison (TMHC) was ditched when gains were too slow to come. The stock was up 2.6% at one point after being added but was removed with the trade ending basically flat. Getting rid of the stock on June 21 as it closed below the 5-day moving average line avoided a 3% drop the following day.Employing the quick profit-taking strategy led to only one trade being removed for a loss in June. Shopify (SHOP) was added on June 2 and was up slightly after a few days before getting clipped on the big sell off June 9. The loss was still kept small at just 0.87%.A recurring theme for the month was that equities couldn't quite hit the 5% profit goal and had to be sold before all the profits evaporated. Direxion Financial Bull 3x Shares (FAS) was a good example. This exchange traded fund (ETF) comprises banks, insurers and other financial firms. A lot of positive reversals in these stocks appeared on June 26 (1). This ETF provided a method of capitalizing on the sector move. Plus, the three-times leverage gives you more reward that you would get from an individual stock without the same risks associated with a single stock.The trade was initially put on the watch list while it finished the cup-with-handle pattern but triggered a little early on June 28 as it broke the downtrend in the handle (2). The next day saw profits nearing the 5% profit goal early in the trading session but quickly reversed (3). Profits were booked at 1.3% as the ETF crossed back below the 50 price point for the second time that day. After being removed, FAS ended going below its buy point and could have easily turned into a negative trade.Taking the profits early and being strict about small losses left June with an 86% win rate for SwingTrader. The average gain was 2.2% and the single loss was only 0.9%. The strategy delivered outperformance despite the sideways market.More details on Past Trades are available to subscribers and trialists to SwingTrader.

302,ALGN,"XStocks moved mildly lower Friday as the Nasdaq and Dow industrial each dipped 0.1% slip.Despite the slip, the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite is on pace for a 1.3% weekly gain, which comes after two consecutive weeks of relatively heavy losses. The Dow Jones industrial average showed a fractional loss for the week. The S&P 500 edged early Friday, defending a slim gain for the week.Among the Dow industrials, upside advancers were scarce. JPMorgan (JPM), Coca-Cola (KO) and Procter & Gamble (PG) clung to small gains of 0.3% each.On the downside, UnitedHealth Group (UNH) and Caterpillar (CAT) fell about 1.2%. Home Depot (HD) and Nike (NKE) declined 1% each.Within the S&P 500, EQT (EQT) and Align Technology (ALGN) paced the upside advancers, rising 1.8% and 1.7%, respectively.On the downside, Sysco Corp (SYS) dropped 3%, while Signet Jewelers (SIG) declined 1.7%. Harley Davidson (HOG) fell 2%.Among analyst actions, Restoration Hardware (RH) and Vertex (VRTX) received upgrades, causing a 5% for the retailer, but Vertex reversed 1.4% lower after early gains. Meanwhile, Piper Jaffray hiked its price target on Electronic Arts (EA) to 128 from 119, while JPMorgan initiated coverage on ServiceNow (NOW) with an overweight rating. Shares of EA and ServiceNow fell 0.1% each.On the earnings front, the bloodbath in brick and mortar stores continued in the stock market today after Bed Bath & Beyond's (BBBY) fiscal-Q1 results late Thursday. The retailer missed both top- and bottom-line estimates, resulting a 10% plunge in the stock price. Meanwhile, Finish Line's (FINL) Q1 revenues came in below the Street's estimates early Friday, but shares still advanced nearly 9%.Leading retailers Ollie's Bargain Outlet (OLLI) and Burlington Stores (BURL) haven't been spared from the sector carnage. The last month has seen Ollie's fall back to its 10-week line where it is attempting to muster support, while Burlington plunged through its 200-day line on Thursday. Early Friday, Ollie's declined 0.1%, while Burlington fell another 1.8%.Within the IBD 50, Grubhub (GRUB) jumped 2.4%, Macom Tech Solutions (MTSI) rose 1.9% and Momo (MOMO) advanced 1%.On the downside, Regeneron Pharmaceutical (REGN) fell 3.7% and Mercadolibre (MELI) declined 1.4%.

304,ALGN,"Most people aren't a fan of losing, especially when it comes to money. But for a swing trader, losses are an inevitable part of the business. The trick is to keep the losses small so they don't do terrible damage to your portfolio. Being able to recover quickly is critical to your psychology as well as your profits.This is easier said than done for many investors. Some feel taking any loss is equivalent to admitting defeat. As long as the loss is only on paper, hope remains that they eventually will be proven right. But trying to save a bruised ego by ignoring a paper loss could set you up for a lot more pain as losses mount.There is also the fear that once a loss is taken, the stock will immediately bounce back without you. That fear needs to be balanced with the possibility that the small loss can turn into a larger loss. Nearly as bad is that you could be sitting on dead money for a long period of time waiting for the stock to recover. While waiting, your capital is at risk with the reward potential questionable.What happens if the loss gets larger than expected? Usually it's best to part ways. Your original thesis has been proven wrong and fighting it just compounds the problem. Thinking that the worst is over is also naive. The phrase ""it can't go any lower"" is proven wrong almost every day by the stock market. Taking the loss when it's small sidesteps much of the internal dialogue seeped in emotion.That proved to be the case with Shopify (SHOP), a recent trade on IBD's SwingTrader. The stock was added as it broke out June 2 in the heaviest volume in eight days (1). The Nasdaq composite was also moving to new highs from a four-day tight area. Volume quickly vanished the next couple days as the stock labored to surpass the 100 price level.On June 9, the stock did cross 100 but then quickly reversed (2) as the tech sector fell and brought the Nasdaq composite down with it. With the shift in the market, Shopify was cut loose early in the day with less than a 1% loss from its entry on SwingTrader. The stock did close the day decisively below the 5-day moving average, a sell signal outlined in the trade setup. But the early sell alert prevented that tiny loss from ballooning into a 6% hit. Things only got worse as Shopify tumbled an additional 9% the following week.How does this translate to managing your portfolio? Well, on the same day Shopify was removed from SwingTrader, profits were also booked for Align Technology (ALGN) with gains over 5%. Letting the losses magnify in Shopify could have easily wiped out all the profits in Align.More details on Past Trades are accessible to subscribers and trialists to SwingTrader.

305,ALGN,"Many funds reversed lower along with the broader market, but these two U.S. index ETFs managed to hold gains.Blue chips and small-cap stocks closed Friday with modest advances as tracked by the Dow Jones industrial average and the Russell 2000 index.IShares Russell 2000 (IWM) broke out intraday past a 141.92 flat-base buy point to mark a new high. But it pared its gain to 0.5%, closing just below the entry. It's formed a series of three bases almost right next to each other since December. Before that, IWM rose 10% from a flat-base breakout in November.The fund, launched in May 2000, has attracted $36.6 billion in assets. IWM has lagged the S&P 500 this year through June 8 with a 4.8% gain vs. the benchmark index's 9.7%, according to Morningstar Inc. But its one-year return of 20.8% has outpaced the S&P 500's 17.3%, and the ETF's 15-year average annual return of 9.07% is also ahead at 9.07% vs. 8.11%.Since May 19, IWM's 4% gain has doubled iShares S&P 500's (IVV) gain.Several of the tech names in IWM's top holdings took a beating Friday, including Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO) and Coherent (COHR), which fell about 5% each. But its financial names helped offset some of the losses.SPDR S&P MidCap 400 (MDY) pared its gain to 0.3% Friday to close slightly below a 320.58 flat-base buy point. It had cleared the entry earlier in the session. The ETF started forming the current pattern after a 3% advance from a prior flat base and 7% from the one before.It's up nearly 6% year to date through June 8 and has slightly underperformed the S&P 500 for one-, three- and five-year average annual returns. But it's ahead of the benchmark index for the 10- and 15-year periods with respective returns of 8.2% and 9.8% vs. 7.2% and 8.2% for the S&P 500.The $18.8 billion fund, which was launched in May 1995, counts Everest Re Group (RE), Align Technology (ALGN) and Duke Realty (DRE) among its top holdings. Real estate investment trusts and other financials turned in a solid performance Friday.Moving over to Thursday's ETF picks, the featured pair of gold funds have pulled back from their cup-with-handle buy points as gold prices slid for a third straight session. But they're not too far from their entries. SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) and iShares Gold Trust (IAU) are 2% below their respective buy points of 123.17 and 12.54.RELATED:Gilded Gains?

Top holdings in the ETF included Medtronic (MDT), Abbott Laboratories (ABT) and Thermo Fisher Scientific (TMO). Abbott, a developer of generic drugs, disease screening systems and other products, is in buy range after clearing a 45.94 flat-base entry on Thursday.XIHI was one of three ETF picks featured in IBD last month by Oscar Pursche, chief executive of Bruderman Brothers and Bruderman Asset Management. ""As opposed to taking a broad view of the health care sector, which we do like overall, we see some great opportunities in the medical device space, to which investors can get exposure through the iShares Medical Device ETF,"" he said.He also noted that the fund's top five holdings account for nearly 40% of the portfolio, which may increase the risk profile. IHI is extended past a 152.83 buy point cleared in April.IBD'S TAKE: Find out which biotechs stand to benefit the most under President Trump's proposed tax reform in this recent tech column.SPDR S&P Health Care Equipment (XHE) returned 16.2% YTD through May 30 and 19.4% for the five-year average.

323,ALGN,"AB Discovery Growth (CHCLX) is seeing some light at the end of the tunnel it's been stuck in. After lagging many of its midcap growth peers tracked by Morningstar Inc. in 2014 and notching a middle-of-the-road record in 2015, the fund is in the top 35% of its peer group this year going into Tuesday. It's in the top 13% of the past three months and the top 5% over the past month.Discovery Growth is up about 7% this year, ahead of the 6.4% gain by its midcap growth peers, but lagging the S&P 500's nearly 10% gain.The fund seeks capital appreciation from small and midcap stocks whose earnings exceed analyst expectations and that undergo upward revisions in estimates.The fund has been managed since 2008 by Bruce Aronow, N. Kumar Kirpalani, Samantha Lau and Wen-Tse Tseng. In their Oct. 31 commentary, the managers said, ""Given the increased uncertainty over global growth ... there is an increased emphasis on secular growers and companies that have greater-than-normal control over future earnings growth (i.e., ""self-help"" opportunities).""Consistent with our investment discipline, our holdings — regardless of their absolute level of growth or degree of economic sensitivity — are well positioned as many of our purchases have unique secular growth drivers or company-specific initiatives that should help drive earnings.""The $1.9 billion fund has made headway with a number of its top-10 holdings and top new buys sporting IBD Composite Ratings in the 80s and 90s.For example, Ariad Pharmaceuticals (ARIA), a top new buy, has an 88 Composite Rating. The biotech company develops therapies that treat aggressive and advanced-stage cancer by regulating cell signaling. Shares are up 114% this year.Five of the 10 top new buys have Composite Ratings of 81 or higher.CyberArk Software (CYBR), one of those new buys, has a 90 Composite Rating. It is the top stock in IBD's Computer Software-Security industry group.The company's suite of programs are designed to detect and respond to cyberattacks at companies before they cause damage.EPS growth averaged 41% the past three quarters. Trading in the low 50s, shares are in a cup pattern and within 11% of their 59.28 pivot point.Ollie's Bargain Outlet (OLLI), another top new buy, has an 88 Composite Rating. The bargain retail chain's earnings per share have grown between 38% and 82% for six quarters.Ollie's is the No. 1 stock in IBD's Retail-Discount & Variety industry group.IBD'S TAKE: Ollie's standing atop its industry group is due to strong growth metrics. In addition to its good Composite Rating, EPS growth averaged 60% in the past three quarters. And its EPS growth this current stanza is forecast as 27%. Consulting IBD's Stock Checkup is a quick way to get a handle on the traits of a stock like this.Ollie's shares are up 90% so far this year. Trading around 32, shares are extended.Six of the fund's top-10 holdings have Comp Ratings of 81 or above. Align Technology (ALGN) is one of them. It has a 98 Comp Rating and is up 43% so far this year. It was the fund's top holding with a 1.9% weighting as of Sept. 30.IBD'S TAKE: The Composite Rating, which starts at 1 and runs to 99, combines IBD's five performance ratings. Stocks poised to move higher often have a Composite Rating of 95 or higher, which means that they've outperformed 95% of all other stocks in terms of their Composite Rating.Align is the No. 2 stock in IBD's Medical Products industry group. In addition to its 98 Composite Rating, it has four quarters of earnings per share growth acceleration. EPS is expected to expand 42% this year. And its annual return on equity is 17.4%.Take another look at Ariad, which targets rare cancers, including those with no other treatment options available today. Earnings per share improved 4%, 311% and 50% the past three quarters, though in only one of those quarters was a profit actually booked. Trading around 14 in a cup pattern, shares are within 6% of their 14.44 buy point. Watch to see if the stock forms a handle to its cup-shaped base.Among the stock's flaws, the cup is deep, featuring a 39% correction. And though sales are increasing, the company isn't making money.The health care sector overall got a boost from the recent election results. Investors seemed to decide that Republican majorities in Congress and Donald Trump in the White House would significantly lighten the regulatory burden on the sector.Middleby (MIDD), another top holding, has 95 Composite Rating. The maker of commercial kitchen equipment and residential appliances is the No. 1 stock in IBD's Household Appliances/Wares group.EPS grew 33%, 39% and 33% the past three quarters. The stock has four years in a row of annual EPS growth.Trading around 135, shares are in a cup pattern and within 4% of their 140.98 pivot point.Yet another top holding, Bright Horizons Family Solutions (BFAM), gapped down 5% on Nov. 2 as its Q3 EPS of 49 cents missed analysts' consensus expectation by a penny. Its quarterly revenue of $383.9 million fell short of forecasts by $3.89 million. Since then the stock has rallied, regaining its 10-week line.The stock has a 91 Composite Rating.

331,ALGN,"The conventional wisdom is to buy low and sell high. But great stock winners tend to have superior ratings before they make big moves.After Monday's market close, Priceline (PCLN), Microchip Technology (MCHP), Fabrinet (FN), MaxLinear (MXL) and Align Technology (ALGN) report earnings. All five have Composite Ratings of 95 or better, which means that they outperform at least 95% of all stocks based on fundamental and technical factors. Priceline, MaxLinear and Align are among six IBD 50 stocks with quarterly results on tap this week.Here's what to expect:Estimates: EPS rising 16% to $29.32, with revenue climbing 17% to $3.62 billion.Stock: Priceline fell every day last week, losing 3.4% and closing below its 50-day moving average. Shares are only about 5% below the all-time high of 1501.79 set on Oct. 5.A powerful, high-volume rebound above the 50-day (currently just above 1453) could provide an aggressive buy point. The stock has not consolidated quite long enough to form a proper base.Hurricane Matthew and the strong dollar may weigh on results.

332,ALGN,"Align Technology not only helps improve its customers' smiles — it's also been making investors smile for much of this year.The stock is extended from a March breakout past a 68.58 buy point in a four-month base and subsequent pullbacks to the 10-week moving average. It's advanced more than 41% from the initial entry to a recent high of 96.90, providing ample opportunities for investors to take profits.Most stocks will pause to digest their gains after a run-up of 20% or so, which is when the 20% profit-taking rule kicks in.Align has been consolidating now since mid-August, so it wouldn't be all that surprising if it forms a new base. Shares have found support above the 50-day line since February. The relative strength line (drawn in blue on an IBD stock chart) is in new-high ground, a bullish sign.On Sept. 7, the San Jose, Calif.-based company announced that 4 million patients had begun treatment with its clear aligner system. There are more than 100,000 Invisalign-trained doctors worldwide, according to Align.""We are very proud to now have 4 million people who have begun treatment with Invisalign clear aligners instead of metal braces,"" CEO and President Joe Hogan said in a press release. ""Reaching 4 million Invisalign patients in half the time it took to reach 1 million is remarkable and reflects accelerating adoption resulting from nearly 20 years of experience and significant innovation in our products and technology.""Earnings growth resumed the past three quarters at 25%, 32% and 59%, following four quarters of declines. Analysts expect a 53% jump in Q3 and 10% in Q4. Sales growth stepped up the past three quarters from 9% to 16% to 21% to 29%. Consensus forecasts are for top-line gains of 31% and 25% in the second half.Full-year profit slipped last year amid a combination of investment and foreign exchange headwinds. But it's expected to bounce back with a 34% gain this year and 26% the next.IBD'S TAKE: It's always sound strategy to pursue the top stocks in a leading industry group. IBD Stock Checkup can help you find out which stocks have top ratings in its group.Align is one of four companies in the 121-stock Medical Products group with a best-possible 99 Composite Rating. It carries high marks across the board including a 96 Earnings Per Share, 91 Relative Strength and an A- for Accumulation/Distribution Rating. That implies recent institutional demand for shares, as does an up-down volume ratio well above the neutral 1.0 level.Highly regarded funds owning shares in Q2 included Columbia Acorn Fund (ACRNX) and T. Rowe Price New Horizons (PRNHX). The number of mutual fund and hedge fund shareholders rose to 598 at the end of Q2 from 520 in the same year-ago period.RELATED:These 4 Leaders May See Growth Accelerate In Q3Dental Stocks Grinning As Consumer Spending Drives Growth

333,ALGN,"Spending on research and development has leveled off as companies increase stock buybacks and dividends, says Goldman Sachs, but some companies do better than others in getting the most bang for their R&D buck.In a new research report, Goldman names companies that it says are ""best positioned to make their R&D dollars work.""Making that list are: Align Technology (ALGN,) Amazon.com (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL), GrubHub (GRUB), Incyte (INCY), Universal Display (OLED), Palo Alto Networks (PANW) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN).Meanwhile, Intel (INTC), Microsoft (MSFT), Google-parent Alphabet, Amazon and drugmaker Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) lead the way in total R&D spending. Goldman Sachs, though, also analyzed R&D intensity (measured as percentage of sales) and other metrics.Since 2005, ""Regeneron, Salesforce.com (CRM), Apple (AAPL), Amazon and Netflix (NFLX) have experienced outsized growth when it comes to gross profit and R&D, as well as price returns over the same period,"" said the Goldman report.IBD'S TAKE: Of Goldman Sach's R&D favorites, Palo Alto Networks belongs to the IBD 50, where you can learn about many growth stocks. GrubHub sports a highest-possible Composite Rating of 99, while Align Technology has a CR of 97. Composite Ratings are part of CAN SLIM Investing.""R&D's share of the total spend pie has been pretty stable since 2010, suggesting that corporations have likely been in maintenance mode with their R&D spend as opposed to being in expansion mode,"" said the report.Tech companies lead in R&D spending, followed by the health care, consumer discretionary and industrials sectors, says Goldman.RELATED:Do You Tend To Buy Stocks Too Late?

334,ALGN,"Investment bank Morgan Stanley on Thursday selected nine ""high conviction"" stocks that have near-term catalysts that could move their shares higher.Of the nine, four are technology stocks: Activision Blizzard (ATVI), Amazon.com (AMZN), IBM (IBM) and Lam Research (LRCX). And a fifth, Align Technology (ALGN), is a medical-products (teeth alignment) company.Two of the companies are currently featured on the IBD 50 list of superior stocks: Activision and Align. And one, Amazon, is on IBD's Leaderboard list.The others are wireless tower operator Crown Castle (CCI), commercial bank SVB Financial Group (SIVB), and energy services firms Helix Energy Solutions (HLX) and Parsley Energy (PE).IBD'S TAKE: Investors.com offers a host of proprietary stock lists to give investors actionable ideas about companies worth considering. The IBD 50 is IBD's flagship screen of leading growth stocks showing strong relative price strength and top-notch fundamentals. Leaderboard provides a select group of stock picks showing the most potential for big gains.""Our analysts believe that one or more imminent events will drive the share price (of the nine stocks) materially over the next 15-60 days,"" a group of Morgan Stanley analysts said in a research report.Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak expects video game publisher Activision to beat Wall Street's estimates when it reports third-quarter earnings on Nov. 3. The Santa Monica, Calif.-based company is benefiting from a shift to higher-margin game downloads, vs. packaged media sales, and online and mobile-game traction, he said.Potential catalysts include a faster-than-anticipated shift to full-game downloads and indications that Activision is monetizing its King Digital user base through advertising.""Currently 15% to 20% of games are downloaded digitally, and we expect this to increase to 40%-plus in the next five years,"" Nowak said.Align Technology, which makes teeth-straightening systems, is set to report its Q3 earnings on Nov. 7.Morgan Stanley analyst Steve Beuchaw is looking for San Jose, Calif.-based Align to report strong results. Catalysts for the stock include inflections in discretionary spending, the rollout of Align's G6 feature set, and collaboration with more digital scanner partners.E-commerce leader Amazon is likely to report its Q3 results in late October. Nowak is expecting Amazon to beat Wall Street's consensus expectations.""Our estimates are driven by higher gross profit per customer, which more than offsets our expectations for higher forward streaming-content (spending) and increased fulfillment deleverage from Amazon's large expected warehouse build this year,"" Nowak said. ""We also see potential for further upside due to ongoing strength in Amazon's AWS cloud-computing business.""Amazon is moving into a phase of improving profitability in its core e-commerce business, even as it takes market share, he said.Potential catalysts include Amazon's Q3 results, acceleration of e-commerce penetration in core markets, Prime membership growth, and enterprise cloud adoption hitting an inflection point, Nowak said.Tech services giant IBM could see a lift as it makes progress transitioning from mainframe and other legacy businesses, Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty said. IBM is becoming more exposed to its emerging businesses in Watson, cloud, analytics, mobile and security, which have double-digit growth profiles, she said.IBM's potential catalysts include an accelerated transformation and recent acquisitions helping to achieve a faster path to revenue growth and improving profit margins, she said.Semiconductor equipment maker Lam Research is set to report its September quarter results on Oct. 19 and will hold an analyst meeting on Nov. 16.""We would expect both events to be positive for the stock,"" Morgan Stanley analyst Joe Moore said. Investors are likely to take a fresh look at Lam in the wake of its failed merger with inspection equipment vendor KLA-Tencor (KLAC).

336,ALGN,"If you had 30 seconds to study the 16 charts in today's Stock Spotlight screen, could you gain any valuable insights? Absolutely.That's enough time to see how each stock is performing with respect to its 10-week moving average. If a stock is trading on the north side of this line, it typically means that demand for shares are strong. The stock is also rising faster than normal.The 10-week moving average plots the average closing price over the past 10 weeks. It's a ""moving"" average because after a fresh week of trade, a new average is calculated. Prefer stocks that are seeing a rising 10-week line, not a falling one. The 50-day moving average moves in similar form but is plotted only on a daily chart.Looking at the stocks that made the screen at the end of Thursday's trading, overall, the picture is bullish. Just two stocks, Align Technology (ALGN) and Paycom Software (PAYC), are trading below their respective 10-week lines.Align's case is more serious. The stock is down more than 4% for the week, and volume has accelerated vs. the prior week. The maker of innovative braces for teeth has enjoyed a 41% run since it broke out past a 68.58 buy point in March out of a four-month base.Align touched its 10-week moving average in the weeks ended April 29 and July 1, then moved higher. Those two pullbacks following the March breakout gave holders an opportunity to add shares to a winning position.Paycom seems to be toying with its 10-week line for weeks, but notice how volume during recent down days has dried up. More sideways price action could yield a new base.Among other stocks in the screen, chemical polymers expert Kraton (KRA) and broadband chip play MaxLinear (MXL) are likely to form new bases, while others are showing surprisingly strong action during a choppy 2016. Yet it still makes sense to take at least some gains on the way up; most stocks are inclined to correct in price after rising 20%-25% past a proper breakout point.When you have Ironman-like conviction and the stock is acting well, you can aim for gains of 30% or 40%. But don't get too greedy.RELATED:Why The Platinum Rule In Selling Stocks Helps You Capture Profits On The Way UpWill Activision, Align Technology See Growth Accelerate In Q3?

337,ALGN,"Stocks closed lower Monday but well off session lows. There were no major sector moves but some noteworthy changes for stocks such as Taser International (TASR) and Logitech (LOGI).The Nasdaq fell 0.2% while the Dow Jones industrial average and the S&P 500 lost 0.3%. The indexes made smaller price movements compared to the volatile activity of the previous several sessions. If calmer trading can continue, it would be a welcome change for the market.Volume was tracking lower across the board.Real estate investment trusts and utilities were among the worst performing industry groups. The SPDR Utilities (XLU) ETF fell 1.3% as it hit a more-than four-month low. Utilities and REITs are sensitive to interest rates, but Treasury yields were only modestly higher, at 1.62% for the 10-year note. The fiber optics industry group, which has been a market leader for many weeks, also was a laggard.Stun-gun manufacturer Taser got knocked down for a 15% loss in huge volume, causing the stock to undercut a base it has been forming since August.The stock fell on news that the New York Police Department had awarded a five-year, $6.4 million contract for body cameras to rival Vievu. Also, the Supreme Court ruled that police use of a Taser amounted to excessive force in a case involving a mentally ill man who was stunned five times in two minutes.Align Technology (ALGN) pierced its 50-day moving average, the first break of support since the stock moved to new highs in March. Although it's not an immediate sell signal, the slide in heavy trading should put investors on guard to watch for more weakness.Amid the bearish mood on Wall Street, a couple of stocks that have appeared in IBD screens broke out of bases.Logitech gapped out of a flat base, leaping 4.7% in busy trading. The maker of computer peripherals such as keyboards and mice had touched the 10-week moving average last week, giving the stock a good bounce ahead of its breakout. The base exhibited signs of institutional support, judging by the gain the week of Sept. 16 in major volume. Shares fell the first week of the base, but closed in nearly halfway in the weekly range, a positive sign.Logitech is a leader in the computer hardware and peripherals industry group, though the industry remains a laggard, ranked 150th out of 197.John Bean Technologies (JBT) reclaimed the 70.55 buy point of a flat base as shares vaulted nearly 4% in active volume. The company agreed to acquire Tipper Tie, which makes machines that clip and tie food packaging, for $160 million. John Bean said the acquisition enhances its Protein Processing business, which includes production of packaged poultry.RELATED:Taser Dives After Lost NYPD Body Camera Contract, Court DecisionMachinery Leader John Bean Plies Its Trade In Food, AirportsAlign Technology Makes Patients, Investors Smile

338,ALGN,"The nation's best-performing stock mutual funds the past three months have been slowly adding top-rated fabless chip stocks such as Nvidia (NVDA), Inphi (IPHI), MaxLinear (MXL) and Silicon Motion (SIMO).Computer software firms such as NetEase (NTES), Ebix (EBIX), Veeva Systems (VEEV), Paycom (PAYC) and Qualys (QLYS) also made top funds' buy list. Computer networking firms Arista Networks (ANET) and Netgear (NTGR) were also favored by leading funds. As of Wednesday, three IBD Computer-Software subgroups -- Education/Media, Enterprise and Gaming -- were ranked in the top 10 among 197 industries.Click Here For New Buys Of Top-Performing Stock Funds For The Past Three MonthsManagers of leading stock mutual funds have continued to graze on medical products firm Edward Lifesciences (EW), Align Technologies (ALGN), Inogen (INGN) and Vascular Solutions (VASC).Building stocks like Thor Industries (THOR), Patrick Industries (PATK), A.O. Smith (AOS), LGI Homes (LGIH) and Central Garden & Pet (CENTA) were some of the defensive names top funds were buying in their latest reporting periods.Other industrial-materials stocks that were looking good included metal fabricators Gibraltar Industries (ROCK) and Worthington Industries (WOR).Top funds held a big stake in Chinese internet retail giant Alibaba Group (BABA). Forty-seven leading funds bought the stock, investing an estimated $417 million, in their latest reporting periods. After clearing a consolidation in mid-August, Alibaba has continued its trek north, notching new 52-week highs.IBD'S TAKE: IBD Best Mutual Funds Of 2016 award winning manager Michael Carmen of Hartford Growth Opportunities Fund explains why he has been building his stake in Alibaba in this IBD report.IBD saw 11 top-performing funds snap up Gibraltar Industries, investing an estimated $18.4 million. The $6.1 billion Goldman Sachs Small Cap Value Fund (GSSMX) added shares to its portfolio in its latest reporting period.The Buffalo, N.Y.-based firm makes and distributes building products and processed metals for the industrial, infrastructure and residential markets. Products include postal-approved, single-unit steel mailboxes, as well as centralized mailboxes and parcel lockers.  In the industrial area, Gibraltar fabricates metal bar gratings and engineered bearings and joints, which are used in bridges, roads and airport runways.Gibraltar has benefited from a construction boom. This well-diversified materials firm has displayed healthy earnings growth in recent years, with EPS growth ranging from 67% to 1,350% in the past four quarters. The firm also raised its full-year 2016 EPS guidance in the range of $1.37-$1.47.After hitting a 52-week high of 40 on Aug. 8, Gibraltar has been working on a fourth-stage flat base, trading within buying range of 40.10.The country's leading funds have been getting rid of some big household names in their latest reporting periods, including internet search giant Alphabet (GOOGL), online retailer Amazon.com (AMZN) and credit card processor MasterCard (MA).  Banking stocks -- such as Bank of America (BAC), SunTrust Banks (STI) and Morgan Stanley (MS) -- were also on the cut list.RELATED:Top Funds' Latest Sells.

339,ALGN,"Any individual investor who's on the lookout for the best stocks to buy -- or a top mutual fund -- can take inspiration from Michael Carmen, a portfolio manager of $4.4 billion Hartford Growth Opportunities (HGOAX).Carmen knows exactly what he likes. He seeks companies with -- to put it simply -- giddyap.""We call it ATOM. We look for companies with accelerating tangible operating momentum,"" Carmen said. That means latching on to good stocks whose revenue growth and margin improvement will both speed up.Those traits open the door to positive earnings surprises and share-price gains.And the fund is an IBD Best Mutual Funds of 2016 award winner, having outperformed the S&P 500 over the one-, three-, five- and 10-year periods ended Dec. 31. Only 9% of U.S. diversified stock funds met that standard.Click Here To See A List Of IBD Mutual Fund Quarterly LeadersCarmen is 54 years old and a senior managing director of Wellington Management, subadvisor of Growth Opportunities. His sidekicks on the Opportunities fund are Mario Abularach and Stephen Mortimer. Carmen is also a manager of additional funds, including $1.1 billion Hartford Global Capital Appreciation. From his office in Boston, overlooking the city's historic harbor, he talked with IBD about his investment approach with Opportunities.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Six-Month LeadersIBD: What makes this fund different from rival large-cap growth portfolios?Carmen: We're looking for companies where we have a differentiated view. So even if we find a company with accelerating revenue growth but that's already reflected in the market price, that's not interesting to us. It's interesting when we have a higher view one or two years out than the consensus view. Our approach is less about getting the next quarter right and more about getting the next couple of years right.IBD: How important is valuation in your buy-sell decisions?Carmen: We do have a valuation overlay, which looks at every company's upside case vs. their downside case. We want to skew the portfolio to those companies where the ratio is greater than 2-to-1 on the upside vs. the downside ratio.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Category Performance LeadersIBD: The fund is in the top 3% of its large-cap-growth peer group of mutual funds tracked by Morningstar Inc. over the past five years as of Sept. 30. But year to date, it's in the middle of the pack. Why has this year been so challenging for the fund?Carmen: Investors need to stick to their knitting. The biggest mistake managers make is to meander and try to do the (investment) style du jour. We've stuck to our knitting. But over the past year the style that worked best (seeks) high-stability, low-volatility stocks (in) consumer staples, utilities, telecom services.Those are groups that are typically not in the sweet spot of what we do.IBD: Yet the market has been uniformly favorable to those defensive sectors. Do you expect that to help you?Carmen: Yes, it's been a tale of two markets. January to early February, the market got pummeled after a solid 2015. Stocks we invest in got hit hard. But it was a great buying opportunity for the types of stocks we like. We didn't pivot to safer stocks. We doubled down on companies we like with great long-term prospects. It was one of the better buying opportunities in the last five years.IBD: What were some of your moves earlier this year?Carmen: We sold Bank of America (BAC) and JPMorgan (JPM) because our thesis on those companies was predicated on interest rates moving back up. But coming out of the second quarter and in view of Brexit, the ability of the Federal Reserve to raise rates in a meaningful manner was compromised.IBD'S TAKE: How will investors react once the Fed finally hikes rates? Understanding the stock market's prevailing trend is a key factor when you are choosing between growth and defensive stock buys. For pointers, visit IBD University.IBD: What buys did you make?Carmen: We added to some positions. We've been buying some Chipotle (CMG) and other stocks like Expedia (EXPE), and we added to Priceline (PCLN).IBD: Facebook's (FB) earnings-per-share growth has sped up for four quarters. Why have you trimmed your exposure in recent disclosures?Carmen: Facebook remains one of our largest holdings, as of Aug. 31. It has been about their ability to monetize mobile traffic. When they first came public, they didn't have a great solution. They finally came up with one, particularly with advertising geared to small and medium-size businesses. But our trims were not fundamentally related. They were to take profits off the table and reinvest in other ideas.IBD: As of your latest disclosure, what's your view on Alibaba (BABA)? You've boosted your stake several portfolio reports in a row.Carmen: They are the premier e-commerce site in China. Investors tried to put them into a U.S. box -- are they Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL)? The answer was all of the above and none of the above. They're a little different.Alibaba's core is a business-to-business platform. Their Taibao is a small/medium business-to-consumer and consumer-to-consumer site. It's a big bazaar. Their Tmall is a brands-to-consumer retail site. They also have a similar product to Amazon Web Services (which is called Alibaba Cloud). And they have investments they (often) don't get credit for.Some people are a little confused by it all. In recent months they've taken steps to make themselves more transparent with financial reporting for each business line. That was a big driver. We added to the stock. When Alphabet and Amazon took steps like that, both stocks took off. We felt Alibaba would make a similar move once investors got more comfortable with the business model.IBD: You've trimmed Amazon recently. Why?Carmen: It's still a big overweight. There isn't a lot we dislike. Over the last 18 months the stock has made a huge move. We like to take profits as a company becomes larger. It puts risk-reward back into balance.IBD: Summarize what you do like there, please.Carmen: What amazes me most is that they are taking 50 cents of each incremental dollar spent online. Regardless of everyone coming at them (with competitive challenges), they have become almost a habit (for online users). And they are willing to take risks. They created their AWS business out of nothing. It is fast-growing, profitable, far ahead of the competition in terms of innovation.IBD: Align Technology (ALGN) is a newcomer to your portfolio. Why?Carmen: They make clear aligners or braces for people's teeth. They're a less invasive way of moving people's teeth (than old-fashioned braces). So they have a great product and great distribution.Their growth rate accelerated. We had a view that this would transpire. We bought it a few quarters ago, and it's up about 50% from our purchase price.IBD: American Tower (AMT) looks like a steady Eddie. Is that why you like it?Carmen: The stock came under pressure last year because growth was slowing. The strong dollar hurt them in emerging markets. But their underlying business is very stable. If they have, let's say, two customers renting space on a tower and a third comes along, that's very profitable because they have fixed costs. Their incremental profits are strong.International markets offer them greater opportunities for upgrades to 4G service. So returns on equity and on invested capital will improve in the next several years, which will reverberate with investors.IBD: You took profits on Alphabet in Q2. What's your view?Carmen: We still have an overweight (vs. the Russell 3000 Growth Index). They have been penalized because their investments (in such things as Care.com (CRMC)) mask the strength and growth of their core search business. So an investor is not compensated now for some investments that could pay off.They just put up one of their strongest quarters in years. They have a run rate (in revenues) of $70 billion and are growing revenue north of 20% last quarter. The stock is inexpensive. At a teens multiple, you're not paying much for the cash on their balance sheet.Their (old) name has become a verb. Not many companies do that. It's a strong position.IBD: I hear you enjoy yoga exercise. How did you get interested? And have you -- you're 5-foot-9 -- given up basketball for exercise?Carmen: I started yoga about 12 years ago in order to increase flexibility and clear my mind.

The Nasdaq fell 2.5%, the S&P 500 lost about 2.4% while the Dow Jones industrial average sank 3.1% -- all dropping below their 50-day moving averages. The small cap Russell 2000 plunged 2.7%. Volume was running higher on both major exchanges compared to the previous session.Comments from two Federal Reserve officials slathered gloom on the bulls who have grown to rely on low interest rates. Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren said he favored ""gradual normalization"" of rates, which the Street interpreted as a rate hike either as early as next week or as late as December. Rosengren is a voting member of the Fed.Dallas Fed President Rob Kaplan, a nonvoting member, said the case for a rate hike has strengthened.In the IBD 50, a proxy for top stocks, virtually every stock was down. Many of the losers were moving in bearishly strong volume. Stocks dropping under their 50-day moving average line included Broadcom (AVGO), A.O. Smith (AOS), and CyberArk Software (CYBR).Other leading stocks lost their short term 10-day line, including Acacia (ACIA), LGI Homes (LGIH), Ubiquiti Networks (UBNT), Align Technology (ALGN), Nvidia (NVDA), Momo (MOMO), Weibo (WB), TPI Composites (TPIC) and Sina (SINA).

352,ALGN,"U.S. stock indexes struggled to stay positive Thursday afternoon, while small caps led for a second straight day.The Nasdaq rose 0.1%, while the S&P 500 hovered near the break-even line, and the Dow Jones industrial average edged 0.1% lower. But the small-cap Russell 2000 advanced 0.3%. Volume in the stock market today was running slightly lower than the previous session's pace.Blue chips were mostly up, but only narrowly so. Visa (V) popped 1.1%, the day's top gainer in the 30-stock Dow industrials. Visa is sketching a somewhat unorthodox, double-bottom base with handle. The middle peak is only 2 cents below the left-side high. Normally the middle peak is further below the left-side high. A handle with an 80.27 buy point might provide a better entry.Other payment processors show similar chart action. MasterCard (MA) could be seen as a flat base or as a double bottom with handle. The middle peak entry would be at 98.09 (best seen on the daily chart). The handle, which looks like it will complete the five-day minimum requirement today, could offer an entry at 96.60.Discover Financial Services (DFS) has etched a flat base with a potential entry at 58.20.The problem with all three of these stocks is that none have top-notch ratings. Wall Street expects Visa's earnings to rise 6% this fiscal year ending in September. For MasterCard and Discover, earnings are estimated at 5% and 12%, respectively, in the current calendar year.So why are these stocks stirring? Wall Street expects turnarounds for Visa and MasterCard in 2017. Earnings next year are expected to jump 19% for Visa and 16% for MasterCard. That is good growth for two mega-cap stocks. (Discover, which is smaller, is expected to grow earnings only 6% in 2017.)In the IBD 50, a proxy for top-rated stocks, winners for the day led losers by a 2-1 ratio.

(PDCO) jumped to a six-month high after its fiscal Q4 earnings and guidance late Thursday beat low expectations, further fueling one of the stronger groups of medical stocks.Dental suppliers were among the few medical groups that held up well during the recent downturn, thanks to a business model that depends more on consumer spending than on government reimbursement. Patterson, however, was a relative laggard compared to such high-rated stocks as Align Technology (ALGN) (now No. 11 on the IBD 50), Henry Schein (HSIC) (Patterson's most direct competitor), and Dentsply Sirona (XRAY).""Given investors’ relatively low expectations for the stock and the relatively weaker year-to-date and quarter-to-date performance vs. Henry Schein, the stock should react somewhat positively today,"" wrote Evercore ISI analyst Ross Muken in a note before the market opened.Patterson stock was up 5.9% at the close on the stock market today, at 48.19.

356,ALGN,"Large-cap mutual funds outperformed small-cap and midcap funds over the past three years.Why? Amid slow global economic growth, investors sought the relative safety of stocks in bigger companies with deeper pockets. Those firms are better positioned to withstand whatever unpleasant shocks the markets unveil. Also, those bigger companies can gobble up smaller rivals that fall on hard times. And U.S. large caps have looked attractive amid doubts about GDP growth in other developed markets.As a group, large-cap mutual funds notched an 8.41% average annual gain over the past three years. That easily outran their midcap rivals' 6.97% average annual return. And it walloped the 5.51% average annual advance posted by small-cap funds.If you have bet solely or more heavily on large-cap funds than the other categories in recent years, it would have been a boon to your overall portfolio and retirement planning.Amid broad market volatility -- stemming from woes in the oil patch, worries about weakened energy companies' impact on their lenders and doubts about China's growth -- this year alone has been tough. Only midcap funds as a group are in positive territory, up a meager 0.45% vs. a 0.13% setback for large-cap funds and 0.79% slide by small caps.Over the entire three years, if you had invested $10,000 in a cross section of large-cap funds on March 31, 2013, by now it would be worth $13,296.The same amount would have grown to $12,683 in the average midcap fund and $12,100 in the average small-cap funds.The $3.17 billion AB Large Cap Growth Fund (APGAX) -- run by the firm that used to be known as AllianceBernstein -- was one of the top-performing large-cap funds over the past three years. It racked up a 14.38% average annual gain.In that same span, the S&P 500 averaged a 10.41% annual gain.Talk about sizzle, AB Large Cap Growth is an IBD Best Mutual Funds 2016 Awards winner for outperforming the S&P 500 over the one-, three-, five- and 10-year periods ended Dec. 31.Fund manager Frank Caruso discussed his investment approach in detail recently in an IBD fund manager question-and-answer feature report.One of his recent holdings is lighting products maker Acuity Brands (AYI), which has helped the fund turn up the wattage on its performance. Its LED products are seeing strong demand.Share price is up 42% over the past 52 weeks.Around midday Friday, Acuity Brands was in a buy range from a 242 alternate entry, but it remained extended from a prior 225.28 buy point. The stock has held above a key test of the 240 price level.The stock has a 99 Composite Rating from IBD. The Composite Rating combines IBD’s five performance ratings, including EPS and Relative Strength ratings, with 99 being the highest.On Dec. 10, Acuity completed its acquisition of Juno Lighting Group, a maker of LED-based down- and track-lighting fixtures.On April 6, Acuity reported profit in the February-ended fiscal second quarter of $1.80 a share. That was up 53% and nicely above the consensus estimate of $1.51. Sales rose 26% to $777.8 million. Analysts were modeling $752.3 million.Earnings per share rose 29% and 24% in the prior two quarters. The stock's dividend yield is 0.2%.Adobe Systems (ADBE) is another holding with a strong Comp Rating, in this case 91. Shares are up 25% in the past 52 weeks.Early afternoon on Friday, Adobe Systems was closing in on a 98.10 cup-with-handle buy point, IBD's markets team noted. Volume had dried up as the handle formed, which is positive. An earlier breakout past an 88.65 handle entry within the base was successful, and from that point of view, the stock was extended.However, you could argue that the right side of the stock's base needed more work.  The image-editing and PDF-software giant has made a successful transition in allowing customers to receive products through the cloud and pay a subscription fee.Adobe's fiscal second quarter ends in May. Wall Street sees earnings rising 42% to 68 cents a share. That would extend the slowdown in EPS gains, which grew 30%, 93%, 59% and 50% in the prior four quarters, but still represents robust profit growth Dental products firm Align Technology (ALGN) is up 29% over the past 52 weeks.EPS grew 25% and 32% the past two quarters.

He also sees 2016 ""as the year of Instagram,"" with the platform adding more than $2 billion in incremental revenue. Another catalyst cited political ad spending.Facebook reports Q4 earnings on Jan. 27. Morgan Stanley views are 2% above consensus on earnings and 4% above on revenue. Its price target is 130.On Lam Research, Morgan expects the company to continue to outpace overall capital spending levels.

381,ALGN,"Shares of medical equipment maker Cyberonics (CYBX) fell sharply after it reported mixed fourth-quarter estimates.

Wall Street expected $76.7 million.For the full year, Cyberonics sees EPS of $2.33 to $2.39. Consensus of 10 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters was for $2.38 a share.The company's light earnings projection comes amid a shift in management and higher spending to launch several new products.On April 28, the medical-device maker named Rohan Hoare to the newly created position of chief operating officer, and O'Neill D'Cruz as chief medical officer.Like other medical-gear makers, including highly rated Invisalign clear braces maker Align Technology (ALGN), whose stock is on the IBD 50 list of top-rated stocks, and spine-disorder treatment gear maker Globus Medical (GMED), Cyberonics makes highly specialized equipment.Cyberonics makes monitoring devices and systems that deliver mild electrical pulses to the vagus nerve in a patient's neck, which sends a signal to the brain.Cyberonics' new AspireSR brand pulse generator for treatment of epilepsy and depression was approved in Europe in February, and ""communications with the Food and Drug Administration to determine next steps for U.S. approval for the AspireSR generator are underway,"" Cyberonics CEO Dan Moore said Wednesday after the earnings announcement.Moore had said earlier that the company was making ""significant, multiyear investments in our sales force ... and our technology pipeline"" to support the rollouts.Cyberonics' new Centro and ProGuardian systems are also nearing or under submission to regulatory agencies for approval.After plunging as much as 7% in six times usual trading volume, Cyberonics shares were down 6% in late morning trading in the stock market today (Wednesday).The small company has been a steady Eddie, growing at a consistent pace.Over the last five years, its annual revenue has grown 68% to $282 million.

382,ALGN,"Sometimes a stock isn't just simply forming a base or making a pullback. As in the case of Align Technology (ALGN), it can be both.The stock has pulled back in recent weeks following a huge earnings pop on Oct. 18. Align is finding support at its 10-week moving average, which is its second pullback since breaking out past a 38.84 buy point in July.Align retreated in some heavy volume, which has taken its Accumulation/Distribution Rating down to a neutral C. This gauge of institutional buying and selling was at A in October, when the stock bolted to a record high.With the stock correcting less than 15% for more than five weeks, Align also should be considered to be forming a flat base.The traditional buy point for the flat base is still a ways ahead at 60.10. An alternative entry exists at 59.90, but that's not much of a difference.The San Jose, Calif., company is best known for its bread-and-butter Invisalign clear braces, an alternative to metal braces at roughly comparable cost.Invisalign sales account for more than 90% of total revenue. Align also makes scanners and provides digital services for dentists and orthodontists.A new material for its Invisalign system introduced early this year and the Realine aligner introduced in June are helping to drive growth.The firm had some rough spots in late 2012 and early this year. Profit fell in Q3 and Q4 of last year and was flat in the first quarter of this year. But sales rose 8% to 14% over those periods.Earnings have since bounced back. Align delivered profit growth of 6% and 62%, respectively, in Q2 and Q3. For the current quarter, analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect earnings of 43 cents a share, up 65% from a year ago. This would mark another quarter of accelerating growth.

383,ALGN,"If you had braces as a kid, you probably remember the woven metal brackets and wires. Well, Align Technology  (ALGN) has developed an alternative way to straighten teeth. Earlier this year the firm introduced a new material for its Invisalign clear aligner system. It's called SmartTrack and it is made of a highly elastic material that keeps its shape…
"
384,ALGN,"Any time a stock breaks out with conviction and refuses to give up gains, it's worth watching.Align Technology (ALGN) soared 34% during the week ended Oct. 18 after the company reported exceptional third-quarter earnings. It's been moving sideways since then, holding on to the bulk of its gains.Its third-quarter earnings report showed that its Invisalign transparent braces for teeth are seeing increasing demand. The braces are clear, removable appliances that don't rely on the use of metal or ceramic brackets and wires.Year-over-year growth was strong and accelerated nicely from the second quarter. Earnings rose 62% to 42 cents a share, well above the consensus estimate of 30 cents. Sales rose 21% to $164.5 million, up from gains of 11%, 14% and 12% in the prior three periods. Invisalign shipments rose 16%.Growth is expected to accelerate again in the current quarter. The company said it expects fourth-quarter volume growth of 21% to 24% and sales growth of 27% to 30%.Analysts lifted their price targets significantly after the numbers came out. Cantor Fitzgerald raised its target to 60 from 42. JMP Securities lifted its target to 64 from 47.Cadent Holdings, a subsidiary of Align Technology, provides 3D digital scanning solutions for orthodontics and dentistry.Interestingly, short interest remains relatively high in the stock despite improving fundamentals. As of Oct. 15, total short interest stood at around 7.8 million shares. Based on its average daily volume of just over 1 million shares, it would take about 7.5 days to cover the entire short position. That's on the high side, but stocks with high short interest can make explosive moves to the upside. Align showed that on Oct. 18.Chartwise, Align needs to consolidate more before a new entry arises. It just started its third week of consolidation. Recent sideways action shows that a flat base could take shape from here, but a flat base needs at least five weeks to form.
"
385,ALGN,"A perfectly shaped cup base looks smooth and symmetrical, like a tea cup. But a crack in the pattern can let your hard-earned money drain away.A faulty base is a warning sign that your stock could fail no matter how great its fundamentals. That's because the shape of cups and other bases is determined mainly by the buying and selling actions of institutional investors, who ultimately determine a stock's fate.Align Technology (ALGN) had respectable fundamentals when it broke out of a cup base on April 12, 2004. Also, the pattern was 20% deep, within the desirable range for cup bases.Yet the stock rolled over soon after it cleared the buy point at 22, crashing through its 10-week line in double its average weekly volume. Along the way, the stock fell 8% below the entry, triggering a sell rule.A close look at Align's chart would have revealed several flaws. As mentioned above, a cup base should be smooth and symmetrical, with the left side of the pattern as close as possible to a mirror image of the right.But Align's cup was V-shaped and lopsided, with eight straight weekly declines on the left side (1) followed by only three weeks up on the right. Breakouts that occur when a stock shoots straight up from deep in a base to new highs are especially prone to failure.Volume on the downside of the cup (2) was higher than on the upside, indicating big funds lacked enthusiasm as the stock neared the buy point.Another risk factor was that Align's base had formed after the stock had already enjoyed a sharp run-up. Such later-stage bases have a lower chance of success.Finally, there's the market. Few stocks can withstand a correction, least of all those with flaws. Align's sell-off picked up speed as the major averages corrected in late April. But Align never recovered even after the market uptrend resumed in late May.Align ended 2004 at 10.75, 53% below its April 19 peak of 22.81.Other flaws to watch for include wide-and-loose action, including weekly swings of, say, more than 10% from a stock's weekly high to its low. Big swings indicate a battle is raging between buyers and sellers.Also, a flagging Relative Strength line indicates that the stock is underperforming the overall market. Ideally, a stock's RS line should be hitting new highs as it breaks out.

416,ALGN,"Sometimes, a growth stock does exactly what it's supposed to do after a breakout.It follows through in heavy volume. Or it holds gains, trades tightly and moves sideways, giving no sell signals whatsoever. Price action like this tends to happen in a healthy bull market when new money is coming in from the sidelines.But breakouts aren't always easy to handle.Sometimes, they run into trouble quickly, reversing in heavy volume soon after the breakout. When this happens, you don't have to wait for IBD's flagship key sell rule to trigger.The rule says to always cut losses 8% below your purchase price, but failed breakouts are a reason to keep losses even smaller. Don't wait around to see how a stock responds after a heavy-volume reversal. Recognize institutional selling when it happens and play defense. Cutting losses at 3-4% below your purchase, or cutting bait at breakeven, is perfectly acceptable when a stock doesn't ""act right"" after a breakout.Focus your buys when the odds are in your favor to make money — that is, when major averages are in a confirmed uptrend.A market uptrend under pressure, however, means that distribution days, or higher-volume declines, are starting to increase in frequency in the indexes. If you buy a breakout in an environment like this, the breakout is less likely to bear fruit. So keep the overall market's health in mind. If you buy a breakout when there are four or five distribution days in the indexes, cutting losses quickly is often a good strategy.On April 12, 2004, Align Technology (ALGN) broke out powerfully from a cup-shaped base over 22, soaring 10% in more than double-average volume. In the next day's IBD, the Composite Rating was 91, the EPS an 81, the RS 90.Yet instead of extending gains the following day, it fell 4%. Not ideal action but no reason to sell either because it closed at 21.50, only 2% below the buy point. However, distribution days were piling up on the Nasdaq.Align rallied back in light volume over the next few days and briefly hit a new high, but on April 20, the stock reversed in heavy volume, falling 9% in fast trade. (1) It was a sign of unequivocal institutional selling. Even though it closed 5.6% below the 22 entry, there was no need to hold the stock any longer because of abnormal price action so soon after the breakout. Align lost 60% over the next 6-1/2 months.

515,ALGN,"A choppy market is an uncertain market, and a time when investors need to shift strategies.Maybe you've had a good year so far, with most of your stocks turning out 20% or better gains. Maybe you are just starting with high aims and are confident that the market is set to move higher.In either case, distribution days can quickly stack up against the major indexes. A stalling market can rapidly turn into a correcting market.Don't let comfort or overconfidence keep you from adopting the proper stance. One of the key shifts in strategy is to ratchet down your expectations on gains.In a healthy market, you might normally shoot for a minimum 15% or 20% gain. If the ride gets rough, sell at 10%.If things get even more dicey, tamp your expectations even further — a 5% gain in a tough market is a win. And a 5% gain, or even a tiny loss, hands down beats being trapped in a correcting stock, waiting to see whether it will allow you to recover lost capital.This is especially true if the market turns up, follows through and launches another uptrend. Taking small gains is more likely to leave you cash-ready, in a positive state to tap breakout stocks at the start of a new uptrend.The need for caution is doubled if the market turns choppy during earnings season.Let's say you bought Align Technology (ALGN) coming out of a flat base at 36.20 last year in early September. The market was in an uptrend, and Align quickly ran up 10%. Then it pulled back as the market turned choppy and began racking up distribution days.By late September, investors reading the Big Picture saw that the S&P 500 was demonstrating stalling action and growing signs of heavy institutional selling.At that time, Align was nearly 10% off its all-time peak of 39.82, but holding above its 50-day line. All stock holders without a significant price cushion should have been on watch.Align bounced higher in the first couple days of October, but it was clear that the overall market was having trouble. Distribution days were mounting; market gains occurred in weak volume.Align flashed no real sell signs, but showed signs of struggle. It tried to stab higher in weak volume Oct. 5 and could not match its high. (1) Volume was weak and it reversed lower. As the stock fell back to test 50-day-line support, the market outlook shifted to ""Uptrend under pressure"" after the market closed on Oct. 9.The next day, the market fell hard again. IBD's Market Pulse switched the outlook into a correction. That was a red alert.When the stock pushed almost 6% above the buy point in flat volume on Oct. 16, it was a good time to take profits at 5% to 6% and call it a day. (2) Q3 results were due out the 17th. A weak report (EPS up just 4%, sales up 8%) set shares through their 50-day line in massive trade. It collapsed 20% the next session.

524,ALGN,"New highs are showing encouraging signs, though they're not yet of an unmistakably bullish nature.If investors dig a bit, they will find either new highs involving breakouts or new highs representing good follow-up action from breakouts or, other times, new highs scored in an aggressive fashion without being near a recent buy point or buy zone.All this is good, although the tally of combined new highs — Nasdaq plus NYSE — isn't yet at strong levels.On Tuesday, Canada-based Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX) became the latest stock to quit playing Hamlet around the buy point and thrust ahead confidently. The stock rose 12.73 to 125.35 in volume about triple its usual rate. Valeant made a new high and cleared a 115.50 buy point. The stock is now extended from the 5% buy zone that runs to 121.28.This means Valeant should not be bought because an extended stock can shake an investor out of a position with a normal pullback. The investor who buys near the ideal buy point has a much better chance of riding out a minor pullback. The pullback will often end before getting near the area (-7% to -8%) where an investor should cut losses.For those who buy extended stocks, however, there are no minor pullbacks. A decline can reach the nerve-wracking level in a flash.Stocks following up Tuesday on recent breakouts — with good gains and new highs in heavy volume — included: China-based JinkoSolar (JKS), up 92 cents to 36.48; Canadian Solar (CSIQ), up 2.84 to 38.57; clear dental braces provider Align Technology (ALGN), up 1.46 to 61.36; Amira Nature Foods (ANFI), up 74 cents to 18.93; MRI scanner developer Fonar (FONR), up 2.33 to 26.32; and China online social platform provider YY (YY), up 4.84 to 62.18.Other stocks moved to new highs with no recent breakout. They included: Google (GOOG), up 21.54 to 1,138.86; chip designer Ambarella (AMBA), up 1.55 to 35.61; and St. Jude Medical (STJ), up 1.26 to 64.90.If the major indexes can find the horsepower to jump higher, look for more new highs from highly rated stocks. Such a move could also bring the tally of combined new highs to 400 to 600, a level not seen yet this year.Click here to view the full list of 52-Week New Highs & Lows.

564,ALGN,"The market uptrend gained traction Friday after the November jobs report came in better than expected. The market tide is still flowing positive, which means it's OK to nibble at some names with strong fundamentals and technicals.In recent days, the Stock Spotlight screen has served up several names still within buying range.Sierra Wireless (SWIR), featured in this column on Wednesday, is testing the 10-week moving average for the second time since its September breakout.The company's technology has been described as ""disruptive."" That's a good thing, because in the business world disruptive is synonymous with ""new,"" and new can drive big earnings and sales growth ahead. Sierra Wireless is well positioned for the growth in the machine-to-machine (M2M) market. M2M communication is frequently seen in warehouse management, robotics, logistic services, supply chain management and fleet management.New issue NRG Yield (NYLD), meanwhile, is in buying range after a recent flat-base breakout over 37.59. It went public in July at 22 and has nearly doubled in price. The company operates fossil fuel, solar and wind power generation facilities in the U.S. Its thermal infrastructure assets provide steam, hot or chilled water, and electricity to commercial businesses. Year-over-year revenue growth has accelerated over the past three quarters, from 2% to 20% to 88% to 102%.Herbalife (HLF) is also within buying range after clearing a double-bottom-with-handle buy point of 73.28. Short interest remains high in the stock despite a consistent track record of earnings and sales growth.Align Technology (ALGN) is showing supporting action at its 10-week line as it works on a potential flat base. The company's Invisalign transparent braces continue to see improving demand. Its latest earnings report turned a lot of heads with profit up 62% to 42 cents a share and sales up 21% to $164.5 million, a quarterly record.

574,ALGN,"Few tools in the trader's workshop see as much active duty as the moving average lines.These useful markers are charted over a stock's price bars and come in many varieties. Most commonly used: the 10-week and the 50-day lines.The two follow similar trajectories: the former on a weekly, the latter on a daily chart.The 10-week average is the sum of a stock's weekly closing prices over the prior 10 weeks, divided by 10. A 50-day line sums up the 50 most recent days of closing prices and divides by 50.Institutional investors who favor buying on price weakness often use the 50-day line as a baseline. When a stock's price eases, they step in to buy near the 50-day line. That buying fuels the rebounds used by CAN SLIM investors as add-on opportunities.A stock cutting below the 50-day line in serious volume is a warning. It is not an automatic sell signal, but alerts investors the stock may be weakening.The 40-week and 200-day moving averages can also provide sell signals, albeit usually late ones.Align Technology (ALGN) held closely to its 10-week line during its winning run last year.A huge third-quarter earnings surprise launched the stock above its 10-week line on Oct. 28, 2011. (1)  It also set up a four-week handle in a long cup base. The stock broke out on Nov. 30. (2)The 10-week and 40-week lines moved back into normal alignment the week after the breakout (3) — meaning the 10-week should lead the 40-week. As Align climbed, it pulled back to support at its 10-week average and built bases along the way.The stock briefly shook free of its 10-week moving average after its April 23 earnings release. But it dropped back to the line and began another base that would run through late June.Align made small stabs below its 10-week line in firm trade as early as January 2012. Yet in most cases, the stock sprang off its lows and finished the week higher and above the line.In July, it began to punch through the line in more serious volume. The stock recovered in huge trade (4), but the incursion was enough to warn investors to be alert. The final break below the 50-day line came on Oct. 17 (5) (see a daily chart) in heavy trade. Align dropped 20% the next day; by December it was 41% off its September high.

597,ALGN,"Santarus (SNTS) is expected to remain the earnings growth leader among the top four small-cap medical stocks when it reports Thursday, beating out Medicines Co. (MDCO) and Questcor Pharmaceuticals (QCOR) and Align Technology (ALGN).Today's Screen Of The Day is Small Cap Leaders, top-rated companies with a market capitalization less than $10 billion.The top four medical stocks are sorted by year-over-year earnings per share growth in the last reported quarter.Specialty drugmaker Santarus has been a top performer this year due in large part to strong sales of bowel-disease drug Uceris, which was launched earlier this year. Santarus' earnings jumped 210% in Q2.Santarus is the only company in the group that hasn't announced Q3 results. It's slated to report Thursday after the market closes. Consensus of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters is for a 154% rise in EPS to 33 cents, on a 73% hike in revenue to $94.45 million. Shares fell 3% in Wednesday trading on the stock market today.Medicines Co. develops heart drugs including anti-coagulants used in critical care units. In Q3, it saw EPS rise 74%, led by Angiomax, an injectable anti-clotting drug used in heart surgery that accounts for 80% of the company's revenue.But Medicines' shares have been rising on prospects of possible Food and Drug Administration approvals in the next two years.Questcor Pharmaceuticals treat autoimmune and inflammatory diseases.

"
599,ALGN,"Everything is going digital these days, and orthodontics is no exception.
"
600,ALGN,"Align Technology (ALGN), the inventor of invisible teeth aligners, is bringing orthodontists' offices into the 21st century.
"
601,ALGN,"The San Jose, Calif.-based firm acquired Cadent Holdings last year, and with it, 3D digital scanning technologies that dentists can use ""chair-side"" to get a digital impression or mold of a patient's teeth to use in various procedures.
"
602,ALGN,"""About 70% of cases today are now done digitally,"" said Matt Dolan, an analyst at Roth Capital Partners. ""Either in the doctor's office they create a digital image, or you'll take an impression with the traditional goo that they put in your mouth and then they'll send it to the dental lab, which will create a digital image.
"
603,ALGN,"""So clearly, dentistry is going digital, and Align bought Cadent in an effort to capitalize on that trend. It's a little bit complementary, and it's a little bit strategic.""
"
604,ALGN,"Align's patented Invisalign system, which was launched in 1999, is today distributed via 70,000 trained dentists and orthodontists in more than 45 countries. The company has manufactured 91 million aligners and shipped 1.8 million cases to date.
"
605,ALGN,"Invisalign Technology
"
606,ALGN,"In the first quarter of 2012, it shipped more than 85,000 cases.
"
607,ALGN,"But digitizing the industry isn't the only strong point for Align. Thanks to continuous innovation, the company has significantly expanded its Invisalign portfolio of treatments.
"
608,ALGN,"""For example, new features launched in Invisalign G3 in October 2010 and Invisalign G4 in October 2011 make it easier for doctors to address more challenging tooth movements, improving predictability and leading to better overall outcomes,"" said Thomas Prescott, Align president and CEO.
"
609,ALGN,"Some of the new features help with open bite treatment, extrusion of upper laterals and root control for canines and central incisors, he said.
"
610,ALGN,"Other products range from Invisalign Express 5 and 10 for very minor treatments to Invisalign Full, Invisalign Teen and Invisalign Assist for more comprehensive treatments for adults and teenagers.
"
611,ALGN,"""They all benefit from all the technology in Invisalign G3, G4 and beyond,"" Prescott said.
"
612,ALGN,"In January, Align released Invisalign Express 5, a cost-effective treatment for very minor malocclusions, or misalignment of teeth.
"
613,ALGN,"""We believe that many patients want to correct a little crowding or other minor malocclusions, but don't actually pursue or accept treatment because they believe orthodontic treatment is too expensive for minor correction,"" Prescott noted.
"
614,ALGN,"The dentist's cost for an Invisalign treatment is $1,500 to $1,700. But the final number is based on volume. Treatment usually takes 18 to 24 months with two trays per month. It's then up to the practitioner to decide how much to charge the patient. Those prices have ranged from $3,000 to $7,000.
"
615,ALGN,"The North American addressable patient population is about 800,000 people per year, writes ThinkEquity analyst Spencer Nam in his report. Globally, it has exceeded 1.5 million patients annually. Translated in dollars, it is expected to grow from $1.6 billion in 2010 to $4 billion by 2015.
"
616,ALGN,"The main advantage of Invisalign next-generation products is that they are addressing severe cases of malocclusion, which represent more than 50% of all cases. This is a segment that Align could not treat previously.
"
617,ALGN,"The company is also focusing more on the teenage market, where it had been underrepresented.
"
618,ALGN,"""Align's business by age group is the reverse of the orthodontic market. Align historically had 80% or more adult-oriented cases,"" said Dolan.
"
619,ALGN,"Thanks to next-generation technologies, treatments, new software and the Invisalign Teen product, ""they are starting to chip away now at the core teenage market. And that's been growing organically in excess of 20% ... . We think that will continue to be a driver,"" he said.
"
620,ALGN,"Align has also been expanding internationally, even though it's still very much underpenetrated in many regions.
"
621,ALGN,"""International represents an increasingly significant part of Align's business,"" said Prescott. ""Over the past five years, international sales have more than tripled to a quarter of Align's total revenue. Our primary focus is on driving growth in our direct sales regions, including the core European country markets, Japan and our newest direct market, China.""
"
622,ALGN,"In addition, Align is pursuing new markets via distribution partners. Those are smaller, but fast-growing markets in Asia Pacific, EMEA and Latin America.
"
623,ALGN,"""Collectively, they continue to make good progress and represent 14% of international Invisalign revenue with growth rates outpacing those of Europe and North America,"" Prescott noted. Those markets also usually have more complex cases of malocclusion.
"
624,ALGN,"Chinese Market
"
625,ALGN,"China presents another area of opportunity for Align. ""It is probably one of the few individual country markets for orthodontics that has the size potential to be as big as North America over the long term,"" said Prescott.
"
626,ALGN,"""They are just dipping their toe in the water there, trying to understand the market better,"" said Dolan. ""I think that's a big opportunity that investors ask a lot of questions about, and we're still waiting to see how that will unfold and when that will become a growth driver. But it's certainly something I would expect over the next few years.""
"
627,ALGN,"From a financial standpoint, the company generates a healthy amount of cash flow and has no debt. In 2011, it generated $480 million in sales. Earnings and sales grew 29% in the most recent quarter. Align also announced a $150 million share repurchase program at the end of 2011.
"
628,ALGN,"""They're making some shifts in manufacturing today, so their gross margin is a little depressed,"" said Dolan. ""But it's a pretty nice, high-margin business, at mid-to-high-70% gross margin over time. So I think the earnings potential of this business is pretty dramatic. A typical device company has 60% to 65% gross margin.
"
629,ALGN,"""I don't see any direct competition. They are dominant in this area ... . Long term, there is a very clear strategic argument to be made for Align to be an acquisition target for one of the bigger players, especially as they start to chip away at the core orthodontic market.""Everything is going digital these days, and orthodontics is no exception.Align Technology (ALGN), the inventor of invisible teeth aligners, is bringing orthodontists' offices into the 21st century.The San Jose, Calif.-based firm acquired Cadent Holdings last year, and with it, 3D digital scanning technologies that dentists can use ""chair-side"" to get a digital impression or mold of a patient's teeth to use in various procedures.""About 70% of cases today are now done digitally,"" said Matt Dolan, an analyst at Roth Capital Partners.

660,ALGN,"California-based Align Technology (ALGN) accelerated sales in the past two years. In 2015-17, revenue rose 11%, 28% and then 36%.

661,ALGN,"Through Thursday's close, the medical sector ranked No. 5 among the 33 broad sectors that IBD tracks for middle and long-term performance. The sector has rallied 16% since Jan. 1. So, IBD readers will likely not be surprised to see as many as four of the 16 individual stocks that hit the Sector Leaders screen come from this key section of the economy.With unemployment near record lows and consumer spending revving up, medical care firms stand to benefit. Americans are more willing to spend on improving their health. In IBD's rankings of 197 industry groups (please see Page B7 in IBD Weekly), the medical products group ranks No. 1 in six-month progress, up from 11th six weeks ago. The group has risen 24% since Jan. 1. One of the group's big winners, Abiomed (ABMD), has vaulted 118%.When was the right time to pick up shares in the innovator of heart pumps? A true market leader will storm out of bases throughout its run. Bases are nothing more than periods of time when a stock peaks, corrects in price, bottoms out, rises back near the old highs, and breaks out to new highs.For Abiomed, a five-week flat base with a 200.38 correct buy point produced a breakout on Jan. 5. In April it broke out of another flat base at 304.38.If a good stock has broken out, look for rebounds off the 10-week moving average. The first two instances offer a secondary opportunity to establish a position or add a small amount of shares to an existing one. Abiomed bounced off its 10-week line near 290 during the week ended April 27. Volume increased above the 10-week average. Then the next week, turnover really shot up as the large-cap medical device firm rallied 16% and hit new highs.Align Technology (ALGN), HealthEquity (HQY) and Supernus Pharmaceuticals (SUPN) have also gone on steep run-ups after their breakouts.Notice on a weekly chart how Align, developer of the Invisalign orthodontic braces, has staged a seven-week winning streak. Along the way, the stock cleared a 280.33 entry within a base that showed the essential elements of a cup with handle. Align is very close to rising 25% past that prime buy point.Taking most of your profits by selling winners at 20%-25% is smart portfolio management. You can hold shares longer in high-conviction plays. But locking in gains on the way up allows you to raise cash for future buys.(Please follow Saito-Chung on Twitter at @IBD_DChung for more analysis on leading stocks, charts, buy points, sell signals, and financial markets.)RELATED:Tesla Faces This Critical Test NowWhy This Rule Helps You Become A Savvy Portfolio Manager In StocksUsing The 10-Week Moving Average Like A Stock ProThe Latest Inside Investor's CornerHow To Find The Correct Entry In Hot Growth Stocks

The software giant initially reclaimed a recent buy point on Friday, but pared gains.Intel (INTC) earnings rose 32% as sales grew 9% to $16.1 billion, both well above analyst views. The chip giant guided higher for current quarter sales, indicating a third-straight quarter of top-line growth. Shares initially jumped to a 17-year high Friday but reversed to close slightly lower. Texas Instruments (TXN), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), STMicroelectronics (STM) and Xilinx (XLNX) got boosts from upbeat earnings reports. But chip-gear maker Teradyne (TER) tumbled after warning of weak demand for equipment to test mobile devices. Western Digital (WDC), which makes disk drives and memory chips, tumbled Friday despite beating fiscal Q3 views. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index fought for support at its 200-day moving average.Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) reported Q1 earnings and revenue that topped views but a sharp rise in capital spending, margin pressure and higher traffic acquisition costs sparked a sell-off in the internet search giant. Capex jumped to $7.3 billion from $2.5 billion in the year-ago period, including $2.4 billion for a real estate purchase in Manhattan. Traffic costs — or what Google pays partner websites to generate advertising revenue — jumped 36% to $6.288 billion. Google has hiked spending on YouTube and video content, cloud computing, smart home consumer appliances and artificial intelligence projects.PayPal (PYPL) topped earnings and revenue expectations as total payment volume rose 27% to $132 billion year over year, vs. estimates of $128 billion.

U.S. crude oil futures briefly topped $69 a barrel, the highest level since late 2014, but traded little changed for the week.General Motors (GM), Ford Motor (F) and Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) beat quarterly estimates. Ford will not invest in traditional sedans for North America going forward, and will almost phase out passenger cars by 2020, as consumers migrate to SUVs and light trucks. GM still sees small cars as an opportunity at home and abroad, even as it too shifts focus to larger and more profitable vehicles.Casino operator Las Vegas Sands (LVS) topped first-quarter results estimates, helped by strong demand in global gaming hub Macau and in Singapore. Macau also helped Q1 results for Wynn Resorts (WYNN), but its overall and Macau sales disappointed some analysts. Wynn Resorts also approved a dividend increase. The earnings report from Wynn was the first since Steve Wynn resigned as CEO and sold his stake following allegations of sexual misconduct. MGM Resorts (MGM) narrowly beat, but the stock tumbled on declining traffic at its U.S. locations. MGM is more U.S.-focused than Sands or Wynn.Amgen (AMGN) and Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) broadly topped Q1 views, though Amgen's sales and adjusted profit outlook for 2018 were a bit soft at the midpoints. Sales of Alexion's blockbuster Soliris missed some estimates, but shares popped on a promising study for new drug ALXN1210.

Homebuilder stocks were generally muted due to rising interest rates. But D.R. Horton (DHI), the biggest U.S. builder, on Thursday bested views with a 52% EPS surge as revenue swelled 17% to $3.795 billion. Homebuilder stocks rallied for solid gains, helped by cooling Treasury yields. New-home sales rose in March to an annualized sales pace of 694,000 units, a four-month high. Meanwhile existing-home prices rose 6.8% in February vs. a year earlier.China search-engine leader Baidu (BIDU) reported a Q1 profit that blew past estimates, lifting shares. Baidu still owns a majority of iQiyi (IQ), which held its IPO in March. Video streaming website iQiyi accounts for roughly 20% of the parent's revenue. Shares in iQiyi fell after it released earnings in tandem with Baidu.Visa (V) reported a 29% EPS gain on a 13% revenue rise, both beating fiscal Q2 views. The credit- and debit-card giant raised its full-year revenue outlook. Shares leapt 4.8% on Thursday.3M (MMM) met EPS views as revenue rose 8% to $8.278 billion, just above consensus. But the Dow Jones giant slashed its full-year EPS target. 3M stock plunged.Caterpillar (CAT) reported strong Q1 earnings and sales, but shares of the heavy construction and equipment maker reversed sharply lower Tuesday after warning that operating margins hit a ""high watermark"" for the year.ServiceNow (NOW) reported Q1 profit and revenue above estimates.

Shares fell 5.2% Friday. In Q1, advanced protection solutions nearly doubled to make up 20% of new and add-on bookings, up from 15% in the prior quarter.

In sync with this strategy, the company has announced plans to advance its iTero Element intraoral scanner through the strategic partnership with Exocad GmbH.Per Align, this collaboration with CAD/CAM software provider, Exocad GmbH, will enable the Chairside CAD software (a chairside prosthetics design software application) to be specially integrated into Align's iTero Element intraoral scanner. With this integration, the Chairside CAD software will support same-day dentistry via the iTero Element scanner. The integrated system is expected to be marketed by the middle of 2018.Align claimed that within minutes after scanning, this new iTero Chairside CAD software has capacity to design and produce precision-fit tooth restorations for patients via connected, in-office milling systems.Additionally, this system has been claimed to deliver an enhanced patient engagement, showcasing 3D crown design, streamlined workflow between iTero Element scanners with integrated restorative design software and market-leading certified milling systems.

692,ALGN,"On Nov 17, 2017, we issued an updated research report on medical device major, Medtronic plc (MDT  -  Free Report). The stock carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).As we wait for the company to release second-quarter fiscal 2018 earnings results on Nov 21 2017, the market depicts a bearish picture per the latest preliminary sales update by Medtronic.Over the past three months, shares of the company have significantly underperformed the broader industry. The stock has declined 5% versus the broader industry’s gain of 4.5%.Per the preliminary results, worldwide revenues for the quarter are expected to dip 4% year over year to $7.05 billion. This dull revenue estimate for the quarter to be reported is mainly due to the company’s divestiture of its Patient Care, Deep Vein Thrombosis (Compression) and Nutritional Insufficiency businesses to Cardinal Health at the beginning of the quarter.Also, per the preliminary report, the impact from Hurricane Maria was approximately $55-$65 million on the company’s second-quarter top line. Besides, the hurricane left an adverse impact of roughly 3 cents on its second-quarter non-GAAP earnings per share (EPS).However, despite this year-over-year drag in preliminary sales, it is encouraging to note that the latest projection is actually an improvement from the company’s earlier anticipation of Maria’s impact on its financial standing, provided a month back. That time, Medtronic had projected both fiscal second-quarter 2018 revenues and adjusted net earnings to the extent of $250 million.Also we believe that the aforementioned divestitures align with the company’s disciplined portfolio management strategy. Per the company, the above businesses do not fall under Medtronic’s core product line and hence remain deprived of the required investment and focus at present.Divestment of these non-core non-profitable businesses will help Medtronic focus more on core products. This in turn will also enable the company to invest in long-term, high-return, internal and external opportunities that are more directly aligned with the company’s growth strategies of therapy innovation, globalization and economic value.The stabilizing trend in the global Cardiac Rhythm & Heart Failure (CRHF) market is another upside. We are optimistic about this solid growth trend continuing in the United States as well as the healthy global acceptance of its advanced therapies.Key PicksA few better-ranked medical stocks are PetMed Express, Inc.

693,ALGN,"Ecolab Inc. (ECL  -  Free Report) recently announced an offer to exchange its outstanding 5.500% notes due 2041 for up to $375 million. These notes will be exchanged with a newly-issued lower cost 3.950% notes due 2047. The refinancing of debt is a smart move as it will reduce cost of debt and delay maturity of the notes.Ecolab had an impressive run on the bourses in the last six months, trading above the industry in terms of price performance. The company’s shares have returned 4.1% as compared with the industry’s rise of only 3.7%.  Recently, Ecolab slashed 2017 earnings guidance due to the impact of hurricanes and the divestiture of the Equipment Care business. The company expects adjusted earnings for the year in the range of $4.65-$4.75, much lower than the previous range of $4.70-$4.90. Notably, Ecolab expects the impact of hurricanes on 2017 sales and costs to be approximately 8 cents. Along with this, the divestiture of Equipment Care is going to hurt earnings by a penny.Ecolab is a leading provider of water, hygiene and energy technologies and services that protect people and vital resources.

694,ALGN,"On Nov 16, we issued an updated research report on Luminex Corp (LMNX  -  Free Report) — a manufacturer and marketer of proprietary biological testing technologies with applications throughout the life sciences and diagnostics industry.In the third quarter, the company saw strong top-line performance, solid cash flow and higher profits. The company’s Assay business is likely to be a key growth driver over the long term. Luminex reported earnings of 19 cents per share in third quarter 2017. Revenues in the quarter improved almost 4.2% year over year.Luminex reiterated its 2017 annual revenue guidance in the range of $300-$310 million. This depicts 11-14% growth on a year-over-year basis. Luminex expects gross margins for the next few quarters in the mid-60s. Meanwhile, the company projects fourth-quarter 2017 revenues in the range of $76 million to $78 million.Recently, the company also witnessed favorable tidings at the regulatory front. In this regard, the recent CE-IVD mark for the ARIES Norovirus Assay, the FDA approval of ARIES C. difficile Assay and the reimbursement approval of VERIGENE assay in Japan are noteworthy. Luminex is on the verge of completing its clinical study for Group A Strep and is close to submitting the same for FDA review.The company has a diverse product portfolio that comprises the advanced xMAP, xTAG and MultiCode technology. Moreover, Luminex has collaborative agreements with several companies, which should help expand the use of its products/technology. Notably, Luminex had earlier announced the signing of a new supply and distribution agreement with Bio-Techne through 2020. Luminex also entered into a similar deal with Affymetrix. Under the terms of the agreement, eBioscience, a business division of Affymetrix, will commercialize MAGPIX, Luminex 200 and FLEXMAP 3D multiplexed assay platforms in select countries of the Americas, Asia and Europe.On the flipside, reimbursement landscape and cutthroat competition continue to be major challenges.

695,ALGN,"On Nov 15, we issued an updated research report on Intuitive Surgical Inc. (ISRG  -  Free Report) — manufacturer of the da Vinci surgical system (an advanced robot-assisted surgical system) and related instruments and accessories.  Among major positives, the Sunnyvale-based company has had an impressive run on the bourses, of late. A glimpse at the recent price performance reveals a favorable return of 81.7% in the past year compared  with the industry’s rally of 20.1%. The company has a solid track record characterized by earnings beats in all of the trailing four quarters.  Recently, Intuitive Surgical reported stellar performance on the back of higher adoption of the da Vinci system among physicians and overall growth in global procedures. The system enables minimally-invasive surgery that helps avoid the trauma associated with open surgery. The company’s performance was also driven by growing volumes, courtesy of general surgery, oncology, urology and gynecology procedures.Intuitive Surgical consistently introduces technologies for surgical systems. The company plans to launch an upgrade — da Vinci X — to its flagship Vinci Xi technology. Management confirmed the submission of documents for CE Mark approval of Vinci X. Further, the company expects availability of this device in Europe by the end of 2017. In the long haul, extensive expenditure on product pipeline and expansion in international markets like Europe should drive growth for the company.On the flipside, the company expects procedure growth rate to slow down outside the United States in the upcoming quarters. The lengthy sale and purchase order cycle of the da Vinci system has added to the company’s woes. Also, expenses on research and development (R&D) increased significantly in the first half of 2017, reflecting high spending on advanced imaging, advanced instrumentation and next-generation robotics.Zacks Rank & Key PicksIntuitive Surgical carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked medical stocks are PetMed Express, Inc. (PETS  -  Free Report), Align Technology, Inc. (ALGN  -  Free Report) and Myriad Genetics, Inc. (MYGN  -  Free Report). All these stocks sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

696,ALGN,"Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings (LH  -  Free Report) or LabCorp recently announced that Agilent’s Dako pathology division’s development — the PD-L1 IHC 28-8 pharmDx assay — is now available in the United States for new expanded use. Per LabCorp, this test has got the U.S. approval to be used as a complementary diagnostic with Bristol-Myers Squibb Company’s (BMY  -  Free Report) OPDIVO (nivolumab) for two new indications — metastatic urothelial carcinoma or bladder cancer and squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck — respectively.It is encouraging to note that tests of the clinical studies that supported approval of the new indications for the assay were performed at the company’s Center for Molecular Biology and Pathology laboratory. Per LabCorp, OPDIVO is already approved for the two aforementioned indications without use of the test. However, the PD-L1 IHC 28-8 pharmDx test provides vital information about those patients, who are most likely to respond positively to OPDIVO. Earlier, the PD-L1 IHC 28-8 pharmDx assay was approved for use as a complementary diagnostic with OPDIVO to treat certain patients with non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and melanoma. At that time too, LabCorp’s central clinical trials laboratory was the only provider of testing to support the clinical trial for the 2015 approval of the non-squamous NSCLC treatment indication. Per the company, this successfully demonstrates how the combined capabilities of LabCorp’s clinical laboratory infrastructure and Covance’s central clinical trials laboratory are paving new ways for clinical trials.LabCorp’s consistent efforts to expand in the growing field of complementary and companion diagnostics is gradually fetching unmatched results. Notably, the company has adopted this strategy to work closely with health systems that have expressed interest in becoming preferred partners in LabCorp and Covance’s clinical trials. In this regard, the company has signed agreements with several major health systems recently. Earlier this year, the company entered into an agreement with Thermo Fisher Scientific to join its NGS Companion Diagnostics Center of Excellence program. It has also inked an exclusive deal to distribute OmniSeq’s immune profile and tumor profiling tests. Within Diagnostics, LabCorp has made a strong progress with consumer and patient-facing initiatives. The company’s LabCorp-Walgreens collaboration is off to a terrific start with respect to patient volumes, Net Promoter Scores and patient feedback riding on years’ experience at these sites.Within drug development business, the company is focused on driving future profitable growth through expanded solutions and enhanced operational capabilities. The acquisition of Chiltern closed on Sep 1, is significantly strengthening LabCorp’s strategic position in clinical development as well as accelerating revenue and profit growth within Covance.  LabCorp was trading above the broader industry over the last six months.  The stock has gained 8.1% compared with the industry’s 4.7% gain.Zacks Rank & Key PicksLabCorp carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Two better-ranked medical stocks are PetMed Express, Inc. (PETS  -  Free Report) and Align Technology, Inc. (ALGN  -  Free Report), both sporting  a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.PetMed has a long-term expected earnings growth rate of 10%.

697,ALGN,"On Nov 14, we issued an updated research report on Haemonetics Corporation (HAE  -  Free Report). The company has been trading above the broader industry over the last month. The stock has gained 19.9% as against the broader industry’s 0.5% gain. The stock has also outperformed the S&P 500’s 1.2% gain. The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Haemonetics exited second-quarter fiscal 2018 on a promising note, with year-over-year growth in earnings and revenues. Continued expansion in newer geographies has helped the company deliver strong results in the recent past. Meanwhile, the company’s strong cash position boosts investors’s confidence. The company is also optimistic about strong market adoption of its NexSys PCS plasmapheresis system which recently received FDA approval. Further, the raised fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings guidance is encouraging.Market is upbeat about Haemonetics’ encouraging growth in both Plasma and Haemonetics Management franchises. Plasma continued to witness strong growth in the second quarter with 5.7% rise in revenues at constant currency. In the quarter, North America Plasma disposables revenues increased 7%. Growth continued to be led by strong end-market demand for plasma-derived biopharmaceuticals. Haemonetics is confident about maintaining growth in the commercial Plasma collection business.  On the flip side, the company has been witnessing sluggish revenue growth at the Blood Center franchise, significantly affecting its results over the past few quarters. Management also doesn’t expect any early recovery in the Blood Center’s outcomes.Macroeconomic uncertainty continues to pose a challenge for Haemonetics. Management also anticipates slower-than-expected product adoption by customers which might reduce revenues and profits. Also, currency fluctuations and stiff competition continue to hamper the stock. Contraction in gross and operating margin is also discouraging.Key PicksA few better-ranked medical stocks are PetMed Express, Inc. (PETS  -  Free Report), Align Technology, Inc.

698,ALGN,"Earnings growth enthralls almost everyone, right from the top brass to research analysts. And why not? If the company doesn’t make money, it won’t last over the long haul. Consider a company’s revenues over a given period of time, subtract the cost of production and you have earnings.This metric is also considered the most important variable in influencing the share price. But, expectations of earnings also play a significant role.Earnings Estimates Determine Share PricesWe have often seen a decline in the stock price despite earnings growth and a rally in the price following an earnings decline. This is largely a result of a company’s earnings failing to meet market expectations.Earnings estimates embody analysts’ opinion on factors such as sales growth, product demand, competitive industry environment, profit margins and cost control. Thus, earnings estimates serve as a valuable tool while making investment decisions. Earnings estimates also help analysts assess the cash flow to determine the fair value of a firm.Investors, thus, should be on the lookout for stocks that are ready to make a big move. Hence, it is important for investors to buy stocks that have historical earnings growth and are also seeing a rise in quarterly and annual earnings estimates.Screening Parameters:In order to shortlist stocks that have striking earnings growth and positive estimate revisions, we have added the following parameters:Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2 (Only Zacks' 'Buys' and 'Strong Buys' are allowed. With the Zacks Rank proving itself to be one of the best rating systems out there, this is a great way to start things off.)5-Year Historical EPS Growth (%) greater than X-Industry (stocks with a strong EPS growth history).% Change EPS F(0)/F(-1) greater than or equal to 5 (companies that saw year-over-year earnings growth of 5% or more in the last reported fiscal).% Change Q1 Estimates over the last 4 weeks greater than zero (stocks that have seen their current quarter earnings estimates revised higher in the last 4 weeks).% Change F1 Estimates over the last 1 week greater than zero (stocks that have seen their annual earnings estimates revised higher in the last 1 week).% Change F1 Estimates over the last 4 weeks greater than zero (stocks that have seen their annual earnings estimates revised higher in the last 4 weeks).The above criteria narrowed down the universe of around 7,839 stocks to only 15.

700,ALGN,"AmerisourceBergen Corp. (ABC  -  Free Report) is set to report third-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Aug 3, before the opening bell.AmerisourceBergen’s track record has been quite impressive, with the company comfortably beating estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. In the last reported quarter, it delivered a positive earnings surprise of 3.51%, bringing the four-quarter average to 7.12%. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this release.Factors at PlayAmerisourceBergen’s pharmaceutical distribution segment continues to face headwinds in the form of contract renewals and lower generic inflation. The AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation (“ABDC”) business is also being hurt by several factors, including accelerating deflation of generic drugs and lower contribution from generic launches.Although generic inflation has been nominal, the rate of deflation is rising gradually. These factors, combined with an anticipated shift in product mix toward lower-margin and higher-priced specialty and branded drugs and lack of generic inflation will adversely impact bottom line.However, the company renewed its relationship with the largest health systems customer and has been making persistent efforts to address the headwinds in the ABDC segment. This can boost the top line to some extent in the fiscal third quarter.The company’s estimate revision trend is mixed. For the current quarter, AmerisourceBergen saw one upward and downward estimate movement over the last one month. Current quarter estimate for earnings per share is pegged at $1.37.Also, the company is apprehensive about its earnings and revenue growth expectations for fiscal 2017 due to the uncertainty surrounding drug pricing trends. The company currently expects revenue growth in the range of 5.5% to 6.5%. The company expects adjusted diluted earnings per share in the range of $5.77 to $5.92. Meanwhile, AmerisourceBergen expects brand drug inflation in the range of 7% to 9%.AmerisourceBergen Corporation (Holding Co) Price and EPS Surprise  AmerisourceBergen Corporation (Holding Co) Price and EPS Surprise | AmerisourceBergen Corporation (Holding Co) QuoteEarnings WhispersOur quantitative model doesn’t point to an earnings beat this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise ABAXIS, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | ABAXIS, Inc.

Veterinary instrument revenues were down 20% year over year to $6.7 million.Revenues from the medical market were down from $9.1 million year over year to $8.9 million as strength in Piccolo instrument was offset by declines in medical rotors. Also, revenues at the North American medical division totaled $5.9 million, down 8% year over year. On a global basis, Abaxis sold 261 Piccolos in the quarter compared with 227 a year ago.Abaxis exhibited strong consumable growth, up 3% year over year to $46.0 million in the quarter. Within the consumable product lines, total rotor revenue was $31.4 million, almost in line with $31.3 million in the year-ago quarter. The upside in vet rotor revenues was mostly offset by a decline in medical rotor revenues. On a global basis, Abaxis sold 2.46 million rotor units in the current quarter, down from 2.49 million units in the year-ago quarter. Hematology reagents and rapid assays drove growth in consumable revenues in the reported quarter.However, total instruments’ sales decreased 13% to $8.8 million due to lower veterinary instrument sales.

In the fiscal first quarter, the company missed estimated on both the fronts. Also, a decline in both gross and operating margin is a matter of concern.

702,ALGN,"GNC Holdings Inc. (GNC  -  Free Report) reported second-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of 41 cents, reflecting a massive 48.1% year-over-year deterioration. However, the quarter’s adjusted EPS surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 40 cents by a penny.The year-over-year decline can be attributed to a dull revenue performance in the reported quarter, primarily because of underperformance by the U.S. & Canada and manufacturing/wholesale segments.Including one-time items, the company reported earnings of 23 cents per share, down 75.5% year over year.RevenuesRevenues during the reported quarter dropped 4.8% year over year to $640.9 million. The figure also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $648 million.Apart from lower sales at the U.S. & Canada international and manufacturing/wholesale segments, the decline in revenues can be attributed to a overall drop in sales of protein, vitamins, weight management and food and drink categories.GNC Holdings, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise GNC Holdings, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | GNC Holdings, Inc. QuoteSame-store sales decreased 0.9% in domestic company-owned stores (including GNC.com sales) in the second quarter of 2017. In domestic franchise locations, same-store sales declined 1.1%.Segment in DetailsGNC Holdings reports operations under three segments: U.S. & Canada – including company-owned stores in the U.S., Puerto Rico and Canada, franchise stores in the U.S. and e-commerce; International – including franchise locations in approximately 50 countries, The Health Store and China operations; and Manufacturing/Wholesale – comprising manufactured product sold to other segments, third-party contract manufacturing and sales to wholesale partners.During the reported quarter, GNC Holdings’ revenues from the U.S. & Canada segment dropped 4.8% to $543.4 million, primarily owing to a $15.1-million decrease due to the discontinuation of the Gold Card program. In domestic franchise locations, revenues however rose nearly 1 million on higher average store base partially offset by a 1.1% decrease in retail same-store sales.The second quarter also witnessed the steepest decline in protein, vitamins, weight management and food and drink categories. This decline was partially offset by strong performance by the supplements, health and beauty and the herbs and greens categories. Also, Gnc.com comp decreased 6.3% in the second quarter.Revenues at the international segment increased 1.3% to $43.6 million. Revenues from international franchisees decreased $1.3 million primarily due to the impact of a 1.9% drop in retail same store sales. Also, tough year over year comparison due to year-ago quarter’s additional sales of $4.0 million (associated with the timing of shipments resulting from the annual franchise conference) acted adversely.Revenues from the China business increased $3.6 million in the current quarter from the year-ago quarter, partially offset by the decline in revenues from international franchisees.Revenues at the manufacturing/wholesale segment (excluding intersegment revenues) decreased 8.9% to $53.9 million. Within this segment, third-party contract manufacturing sales fell 3% to $32.7 million, which was partially offset by a 19.3% decline in wholesale sales to $21.8 million and a 2.7% drop in intersegment sales to $61.3 million. Sales to wholesale partners decreased 16.6% year over year from $25.5 million to $21.2 million in the quarter. Intersegment sales deteriorated by $0.6 million from $56.6 million in the year-ago quarter to $56.0 million in the quarter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    MarginGross profit deteriorated 10.9% in the reported quarter to $212.7 million primarily due to the impact of pricing and loyalty associated with the One New GNC plan, which dented the retail margin rate. Consequently, gross margin contracted 227 basis points (bps) to 33% owing to lower sales and product margins at the company’s GNC.com business.Selling, general and administrative expenses rose 10.8% to $154.0 million. However, adjusted operating margin deteriorated a huge 566 bps to 9.2% owing to a steeper decline in gross profit.Financial PositionGNC Holdings exited the reported quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $51.9 million, up from $39.8 million at the end of first-quarter 2017. Long-term debt was $1.509 billion at the end of the quarter, compared with $1.502 billion at the end of first-quarter 2017. Year to date, the net cash flow from operating activities was $72.85 million, compared with $130.89 million a year ago.Further, the company generated year-to-date free cash flow of $54.2 million as compared with $110.5 million in the year-ago quarter.‘One New GNC’ Plan UpdateEarlier, management had announced plans to revamp its existing business model, dubbed as the ‘One New GNC”. The company has been seeing transformational changes during the second quarter 2017 as well. Transaction growth was up 12.3% in the second quarter, resulting in a sequential improvement in first-quarter same store sales. As of the end of the second quarter of 2017, 7.3 million consumers joined the myGNC Rewards Program and there were approximately 237,000 PRO Access members. The company also launched a GNC storefront on Amazon, as a part of the company's omnichannel strategy.Our TakeGNC Holdings exited the second quarter of 2017 on a disappointing note with revenues missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Although earnings exceeded the consensus estimate, the year-over-year decline on both the fronts was a huge disappointment. The decline can be attributed to lower sales in the company’s U.S. & Canada and manufacturing/wholesale segments. Also, the decline in gross and adjusted operating margin is a matter of concern.On a positive note, during the second quarter, management witnessed positive response for its New GNC Plan. New consumer enrollment under the myGNC Rewards Program and launch of GNC storefront on Amazon buoy optimism.Zacks Rank & Key PicksGNC currently has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).A few better-ranked medical stocks are Mesa Laboratories, Inc.

Earnings were also higher than the company’s guided range of 71−74 cents. The figure handily beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 73 cents.RevenuesRevenues grew 32.3% year over year to $356.5 million in the quarter, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $343 million.Per management, strong top-line was driven by robust Invisalign case shipments of 31% year over year to 41.3 thousand doctors shipped during the second quarter. The upside was backed by growth in North America and international regions and a 37.6% year-over-year increase in teenage cases across the board, thereby reaching a new benchmark of 1 million teen patients who adopted the Invisalign treatment.Align Technology, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Align Technology, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Align Technology, Inc. QuoteSegments in DetailRevenues at the Clear Aligner segment (90.0% of total revenue) increased 31.9% year over year to $321.0 million in the reported quarter, primarily driven by continued strong Invisalign case volume growth across all customer channels and geographies.In the second quarter, Invisalign case shipments amounted to 231,890, up 31.0% year over year, aided by growth across all regions. During the quarter, Align Technology added 41,265 Invisalign doctors worldwide, out of which 24,695 were from North America while 16,570 were from international regions.Revenues from Scanner and Service (10.0%) improved substantially by 36.7% to $35.4 million.MarginsGross margin in the second quarter was down 20 basis points (bps) year over year to 75.9% on a 33.4% rise in cost of net revenue.During the quarter, Align Technology witnessed a 34.2% year-over-year increase in selling, general and administrative expenses to $162.9 million and a 31.0% hike in research and development (R&D) expenses to $24.4 million. The operating margin, however, contracted 80 bps to 23.4% due to higher operating expenses.Financial DetailsAlign Technology exited the second quarter with cash and cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities of $601.9 million, which marked a 10.3.% rise from the preceding quarter.In the reported quarter, Align Technology paid $50 million under an accelerated stock repurchase plan (ASR) in which the company received an initial delivery of roughly 0.3 million shares of common stock. Management has $250 million available for repurchase under the 2016 repurchase plan, which was announced last April.GuidanceFor the third quarter of 2017, the company projects EPS of 78−81 cents on revenues of $355–$360 million. The company also expects Invisalign case shipments in the band of 231,000 to 234,000, up 27%–29% over the same period a year ago.Our TakeAlign Technology ended the second quarter on a solid note, with both earnings and revenues beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate.We are upbeat about the continued strong Invisalign volumes, which in turn drove the top line.Additionally, in May, the company announced the receipt of two U.S. patents for Align’s SmartTrack aligner material that is exclusively used for Invisalign aligner treatment. Going forward, management anticipates consistent growth in the Asia-Pacific region. In a bid to grow in this region, the company also opened new Invisalign Treatment Planning Facility in China. We are also upbeat about the multi-million dollar marketing campaign initiated by the company for its Invisalign brand in order to gain through increased awareness.We are also optimistic about the company expanding work flow options of its leading iTero scanners. In this context, Align Technology recently launched a software upgrade for its iTero Element intraoral scanners that is capable of comparing patient scans over time with the new TimeLapse technology.Additionally, the company has a strong cash balance that enables it to carry out share repurchase programs and in turn provide solid returns to investors.On the flip side, unfavorable foreign currency might affect the company’s revenues in the to-be-reported quarter. Also, the company is exposed to seasonal demand fluctuations, higher operating expenses pertaining to increased head count along with higher investments targeted toward growth acceleration in geographical expansion and portfolio expansion.Zacks Rank & Other Key PicksCurrently Align Technology sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Other top-ranked medical stocks are Mesa Laboratories, Inc.

Also, the adjusted operating margin expanded 50 basis points to 21.3%. Financial UpdateQIAGEN exited the second quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $542.8 million, up from $439.1 million in the sequentially last quarter. Year-to-date net cash from operating activities was $129.5 million, up from $147.8 million a year ago. Moreover, the company reported year-to-date free cash flow of $91.6 million compared with $107.9 million in the year-ago period.     .In Jan 2017, QIAGEN completed a synthetic share repurchase that combined a direct capital repayment with a reverse stock split as part of a commitment to return $300 million to shareholders. The transaction was announced in Aug 2016 and involved an approach used by various large, multinational Dutch companies to provide returns to shareholders in a faster and more efficient manner than traditional open-market purchases. QIAGEN intends to repay the balance of the commitment through open-market share repurchases in 2017. At present, the company is left with $55 million under its $300 million return commitment, which the company intends to complete by the end of 2017. 2017 GuidanceBanking on a solid second-quarter performance, QIAGEN has raised its full-year 2017 guidance for adjusted net sales growth to 7% at CER, pegged at the high end of the previously projected range of 6–7%.However, the adjusted EPS guidance has been reiterated at the band of $1.25–$1.27 at CER.This is based on operating and financial leverage which includes benefits from completion of the $300 million share repurchase plan by the end of 2017 and efficiency actions taken in 2016. This, however, excludes the expected 7 cents per share of restructuring costs planned for 2017. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 earnings of $1.24 is below the guided range. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 revenues is pegged at $1.40 billion.The company also provided its financial guidance for the third quarter of 2017. Net sales are expected to grow 7% at CER. Adjusted EPS is expected at around 32–33 cents at CER on an underlying basis. Also, adverse currency translation is expected to have a penny of negative impact on the bottom line. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter revenues is pegged at $355.59 million, while earnings estimates remain stable at 32 cents.Our TakeQIAGEN ended the second quarter on a solid note, with earnings and revenues beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate. We are impressed with balanced growth across all of the company segments. However, adverse foreign currency translation continues to be a drag on overall sales. Furthermore, on the profitability front, QIAGEN delivered strong performance with respect to operating margin.Meanwhile, its commitment to return more to its shareholders through increased share repurchases reflects its solid cash position.We are also upbeat about the company’s strategic focus to drive growth through Sample to Insight offerings. In this space, the company recently received FDA approval for its QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus. Also, the company experienced increased momentum in its GeneReader NGS System. The company is also forming collaborations to drive growth in the personalized homecare space. Recently, it collaborated with Bristol-Myers Squibb to investigate the use of NGS technology for the development of gene expression profiles (GEPs) as predictive or prognostic tools to be used with novel Bristol-Myers Squibb novel BMS immuno-oncology (I-O) therapies in cancer treatment.Also, the company’s QIAsymphony, continued to grow substantially towards the target of more than 2,000 cumulative placements by the end of 2017.

705,ALGN,"On Nov 17, we issued an updated research report on Wright Medical Group N.V. (WMGI  -  Free Report). The company recently reported third-quarter results, wherein adjusted earnings were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Exclusive platforms and technologies like PERFORM Reversed glenoid, ORTHOLOC 3Di and the SIMPLICITI shoulder system were key catalysts in the third quarter.Wright Medical is focusing on product innovation through research and development. The company recently launched INVISION Total Ankle Revision System — the first system developed for total ankle revision arthroplasty. Of the other major platforms, the launch of PERFORM Reversed is expected to boost revenues.Wright Medical’s solid guidance boosts investor’s confidence. The company expects net sales for 2017 in the band of $740-$745 million. This includes negative impact from foreign currency exchange of approximately 1%. The company forecasts 2017 adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations of $84-$88 million.However, lackluster international performance of the lower extremities segment is a matter of concern. Sales at the segment declined 0.6% on a year-over-year basis to $65.4 million in the third quarter. The U.S. lower extremities business sales fell 0.3% in the third quarter. Internationally, lower extremities sales declined 1.7% year over year.Among other concerns, pricing pressure continues to trouble Wright Medical. Increased costs related to product launch and re-building infrastructure are expected to exert pressure on margins. Problems associated with distributors are major headwinds.In the past six months, Wright Medical has underperformed the industry with respect to price. The company’s shares have lost 10.4% as against the industry’s rally of almost 6.3%.  Zacks Rank & Key PicksWright Medical carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

706,ALGN,"With the second-quarter earnings season gaining momentum, the broader picture no longer looks as bright as it was expected to be. Putting together all the 128 S&P 500 members’ released results as of Jul 25, constituting 36% of the index’s total membership, we note that earnings growth pace is less than the last quarter. However, it is more or less in line with the trailing four-quarter average earnings growth and exceeds the trailing 12-quarter average.Per the latest second-quarter scorecard, total earnings increased 7% year over year on 4.2% higher revenues. While earnings beat ratio remains at 77.3%, revenue beat ratio is at 70.3%. (For more information, please consult our Zacks Earnings Analysis).What’s in Store for the Medical Space?Investors are concerned about the healthcare space, a sector that has been seen through a lot of struggle during the past half year, thanks to the political power change and the ongoing policy restructuring related battle.While yesterday, it was finally President Donald Trump’s win with the Republican healthcare bill passing one more barrier by a very narrow margin, investors are however not much optimistic about this development. Per a Vox article today, in its effort to repeal and replace Obamacare, “President Donald Trump continues to make bold promises about what that bill would do — promises that all available analysis suggests the bill will not keep”.While there are still chances that the Senate will amend the latest bill, its extent still remains unclear. Accordingly, uncertainty within the medical space is towering high. Investors are currently adopting a wait-and-see policy about this space.Let’s sneak a peek into the performance of five major Medical – Products companies within the broader Medical space expected on Jul 27.Align Technology, Inc. (ALGN  -  Free Report): We are upbeat about Align Technology’s execution of strategic initiatives like international expansion, which ensured Invisalign treatment for a growing base of patients. In this context, the company strengthened its foothold internationally by acquiring the Invisalign distributors in the highly lucrative Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) region as well as Brazil in February. This is likely to drive the company’s results in the soon-to-be-reported quarter.Align is expected to beat expectations when it reports second-quarter 2017 results before the market opens, as it has the right combination of two key ingredients. The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and has an Earnings ESP of +2.74%. We note that, while a positive Zacks ESP serves as a leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise, a bullish Zacks Rank increases the predictive power of the ESP.

Price and EPS Surprise Align Technology, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Align Technology, Inc. Quote Boston Scientific Corporation (BSX  -  Free Report): We believe, this medical device major’s second-quarter performance will be grossly impacted by the company’s product recall issue within Europe. On the other hand, the company’s downbeat interventional cardiology business may get some sort of a boost with the company’s $435 million acquisition of Switzerland-based Symetis SA.Boston Scientific is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results after the market closes. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. Hence, we are unable to conclude whether Boston Scientific is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. Note that all Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.  (Read More: Boston Scientific Q2 Earnings: What Awaits the Stock?)Boston Scientific Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Boston Scientific Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Boston Scientific Corporation Quote Cerner Corporation (CERN  -  Free Report): We believe, Cerner’s strong sales performance as well as its solid portfolio and strategic initiatives have positioned it well for stellar growth. Cerner announced that it has been chosen by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs to develop an electronic health record (EHR) system. Department of Veterans Affairs will use the same system the company is developing for the U.S. Department of Defense, which began its operation at its first site in February. This system will facilitate the exchange of data between military care facilities and civilian health providers, where current and former service members receive care.This leading healthcare information technology (HCIT) company is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 earnings after the market closes. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 and an Earnings ESP of +1.75%. Hence it is expected to beat expectations this quarter.

Notably, this indicates a rise of 6.5%-9.4% on a year-over-year basis. We believe that the growing adoption of MAKO robots will drive sales in the orthopedic and reconstructive surgery market. Additionally, Stryker is well poised on the acquisitions of both Sage and Physio-Control in the past.The company also expects to beat expectations when it reports second-quarter 2017 results after the closing bell. This is because the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and an Earnings ESP of +0.66%. (Read More: Will Stryker Deliver a Beat this Earnings Season?)Stryker Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Stryker Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Stryker Corporation Quote McKesson Corporation (MCK  -  Free Report): This major player in the pharmaceutical and medical supplies distribution market expects to gain from a gradually stabilizing generic and branded market. The company’s distribution solutions segment performed favorably in fiscal 2017 despite weak pricing trends and customer consolidation.We are unable to conclude whether McKesson is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP and an Earnings ESP of 0.00%.

However, this was offset by acuity mix shift which negatively impacted revenues by 2.5%.Roto-Rooter reported sales of $130.3 million in the second quarter, up 16.7% year over year. According to the company, revenues from water restoration increased 72.1% year over year to $20.9 million.Chemed Corp. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Chemed Corp. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Chemed Corp. QuoteGross margin expanded 189 basis points (bps) year over year to 32.1%. Adjusted operating margin expanded 139 bps to 14.6% in the quarter on a 9.6% rise in selling, general and administrative expenses to $68.7 million.Chemed exited the second quarter of 2017 with total cash and cash equivalents of $13.8 million, down from $47 million at the end of first-quarter 2017. The company had total debt of $125.0 million at the end of the second quarter, compared with $146.9 million at the end of the preceding quarter. As of Jun 30, 2017, the company had approximately $269 million in undrawn borrowing capacity under its existing five-year credit agreement.During the second quarter, the company repurchased shares worth $30.8 million. In Mar 2017, the board had authorized an additional 100 million for Chemed’s existing share repurchase plan. As of Jun 30, 2017, the company had $65.1 million of remaining share repurchase authorization under the plan.2017 OutlookVITAS Healthcare revenue growth projection for 2017 was revised downward to the range of 2% to 3% prior to the Medicare Cap from the earlier range of 4% to 5%. Also, the admissions and Average Daily Census in 2017 is expected to increase 3% to 5% (earlier it was 3% to 4%). Medicare Cap billing limitations are expected at around $2.5 million in 2017, while it was around $3.7 million earlier.The Roto-Rooter business is estimated to grow 12% to 13% in the full year, as compared with the earlier provided range of 3% to 4%. The raised guidance was backed by a 2% increase in job pricing and water restoration services growth.Full-year adjusted EPS is expected to grow in the range of $8.10 to $8.20 ($7.80 to $8.00 previously) as compared with $7.24 reported in 2016.Our TakeChemed’s better-than-expected revenue performance in the second quarter on the back of solid growth in its Roto-Rooter business buoys optimism. Also, we are encouraged to note that both of the company’s subsidiaries saw year-over-year revenue growth in the quarter. The strong bottom-line projection also raises hopes. However, the downward revision of the revenue growth guidance for VITAS Healthcare is a matter of concern.Further, reimbursement-related issues, seasonality in business, a competitive landscape and dependence on government mandates continue to pose challenges to Chemed.Zacks Rank & Key PicksChemed currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked medical stocks are Mesa Laboratories, Inc. (MLAB  -  Free Report), INSYS Therapeutics, Inc. (INSY  -  Free Report) and Align Technology, Inc. (ALGN  -  Free Report).

This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for ALGN, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +2.74% heading into earnings season.Align Technology, Inc.

Furthermore, adjusted earnings jumped from $1.57 per share in the year-ago quarter.Revenues of $25.35 billion missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $25.40 billion but were up roughly 0.5% on a year-over-year basis.Q2 HighlightsAdjusted gross profit in the second quarter was flat year over year at $2.16 billion. Adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses were $782.6 million, down 13.5% from the prior-year quarter. Total adjusted claims amounted to 350.0 million in the second quarter, flat year over year.The company’s EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) witnessed a 1% rise to $1,824.1 million in the second quarter. The upside was driven by operational cost improvement backed by focus on technology, digital tools, home delivery and specialty services.Balance SheetThe company exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $2.35 billion compared with $3.08 billion at the end of 2016. Total debt, at the end of the quarter was $13.84 billion versus $14.85 billion at the end of 2016. In fact, the company is striving to reduce its debt levels. Express Scripts Holding Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Express Scripts Holding Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Express Scripts Holding Company QuoteGuidance Raised The company raised its guidance for 2017 adjusted earnings. For fiscal 2017, adjusted earnings per share are projected in the band of $6.95 to $7.05, up from the previously provided range of $6.90 to $7.04. This represents 10% increase at the mid-point of the range.Coming to the guidance for the third quarter of 2017, Express Scripts expects total adjusted claims in the range of $340 million to $350 million. Adjusted earnings per diluted share for the third quarter are estimated in the range of $1.88 to $1.92, representing growth of 8% to 10% on a year-over-year basis.  Furthermore, the company anticipates compounded annual EBITDA growth rate between 2% to 4% from 2017 through 2020 for the core PBM business. This excludes any contribution from Anthem and other transitioning clients.Express Scripts Likely to Lose AnthemExpress Scripts recently announced that its biggest customer, the leading health insurer Anthem Inc. (ANTM  -  Free Report), is not likely to extend its pharmacy-benefits management agreement, which is slated for expiration by the end of 2019. In 2016, Anthem sued Express Scripts for overcharging its drugs and operational failures. Per management, Anthem refused to participate in further discussions on pricing concessions and probable adjustments for the agreement. Meanwhile, in the second quarter of 2017, Anthem generated $52.6 million in revenues compared with $106.6 million in the second quarter of 2016.Our TakeWe are highly upbeat about the company’s core pharmacy-benefits management long-term outlook. This includes the ongoing volatile healthcare market trends, inflation, patent expiration, lower industry utilization growth and other headwinds.Furthermore, we expect Express Scripts to continue to benefit from increased generic utilization, shift toward mail orders, strong specialty growth and an aging population. Branded drugs are becoming increasingly expensive due to double-digit brand inflation, continued rise in the price of specialty drugs and an overwhelming regulatory burden that is actually paving the way for manifold prospects for generics.Key PicksNotably, Express Scripts currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector include INSYS Therapeutics, Inc. (INSY  -  Free Report) and Align Technology, Inc. (ALGN  -  Free Report). Notably, INSYS Therapeutics sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), while Align Technology carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

710,ALGN,"Leading packaging and paper manufacturer International Paper Company (IP  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Jul 27. In the last reported quarter, the company’s adjusted earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4 cents. In the trailing four quarters, the company topped earnings estimates thrice with an average positive surprise of 4.1%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderDuring the quarter, International Paper inked a definitive agreement to divest its foodservice business in China. The foodservice business offers innovative single-use packaging solutions, catering to the evolving needs of its customers. Over the past couple of years, the company has strategically offloaded businesses in China to focus more on its U.S. operations. It believes that it could cater to the Chinese and Asian markets more effectively by supplying globally competitive products primarily through its Ilim joint venture in Russia and exports from the U.S. and other parts of the world. The company is taking initiatives to drive further margin expansion over time across the businesses.However, International Paper depends heavily on raw materials such as wood fiber, purchased in the form of pulpwood, wood chips and old corrugated containers (OCC), and certain chemicals, including caustic soda and starch, energy sources, principally natural gas, coal and fuel oil. Rising energy, chemical and OCC costs remain headwinds, particularly under harsh winter conditions. This is likely to lower its profitability to some extent.International Paper has a huge burden of pension obligations for substantially all U.S. salaried employees hired prior to Jul 1, 2004 and largely all hourly and union employees regardless of the hire date. Pension plan assets are primarily made up of equity and fixed income investments. Fluctuations in actual equity market returns, changes in general interest rates and the number of retirees are likely to increase pension costs and reduce its cash flow, thereby limiting the positives from its acquisition binge, a primary growth driver.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that International Paper is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it does not possess the key components. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here as you will see below:Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is -1.56%. This is because the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 64 cents while the Most Accurate estimate stands at 63 cents.

While this increases the predictive power of ESP, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise.Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revisions momentum.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:AGCO Corporation (AGCO  -  Free Report), with an Earnings ESP of +2.89% and a Zacks Rank #1.

The company has a solid earnings surprise history, beating estimates in each of the last four quarters with a positive average earnings surprise of 80.6%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Key Factors to ConsiderVASCO is a global leader in authentication, electronic signatures and identity management. The company’s strategic investment in Promon AS helps both the firms to develop mobile application security solutions. The synergies of the deal will likely augment the company’s top line in the to-be-reported quarter.During the last quarter, VASCO announced its ability to help organizations detect and mitigate mobile application overlay attacks through added functionality in the DIGIPASS for Apps Runtime Application Self-Protection module. This module is expected to augment the company’s revenues in the quarter.The company continues to make investments to build its capabilities in sales, marketing and R&D. It remains focused on generating high operating margins, driven by continuous investments and a shift in the product mix with higher gross-margin products. However, these investments might lead to higher expenses, curbing its profitability in the to-be-reported quarter.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that VASCO is likely to beat on earnings this quarter.

We note that the variation in average order value is mainly driven by shift of sales to higher priced items.According to the company, the seasonality in its business is mainly because of the proportion of flea, tick and heartworm medications in the product mix. Spring and summer are considered peak seasons while fall and winter represent off-seasons.During the quarter under review, PetMed acquired 169,000 new customers, up from 169,000 a year ago.

This led to a 5.6% increase in adjusted operating expenses (without depreciation expense), which amounted to $12.5 million. Adjusted operating margin in the quarter rose 415 bps to 18.8% from the year-ago quarter.PetMed exited the fiscal first quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $68.5 million, compared with $58.7 million at the end of fiscal 2017.

Meanwhile, revenues rose from $1.138 billion in the year-ago period.Delving deeper into the fundamentals of the stock, let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this release.Why a Likely Positive Surprise? Our proven model shows that Cerner is likely to beat earnings because it has the right combination of the two key ingredients.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for Cerner is +1.75% as the Most Accurate Estimate stands at 58 cents, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 57 cents. A favorable Zacks ESP serves as a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. Zacks Rank: Cerner currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings. Conversely, Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.The combination of Cerner’s Zacks Rank #3 and positive ESP makes us reasonably confident of a positive earnings surprise this season.Cerner Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Cerner Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Cerner Corporation QuoteFactors to ConsiderView Upbeat: We believe Cerner’s strong sales performance, solid portfolio and strategic initiatives have positioned it for stellar growth. For second-quarter 2017, the company forecasts revenues between $1.265 billion and $1.335 billion. Adjusted earnings are now expected in the band of 60 cents to 62 cents per share.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share is stable at 57 cents over the same time frame.Robust Portfolio: We believe that Cerner’s strong product portfolio will help boost its customer base. The frequent contract wins reflect growing traction. Furthermore, the company has strong growth opportunities in the revenue cycle management (RCM) and ambulatory space.Solid Global Foothold: Cerner is one of the largest pure-play HCIT companies and its wide footprint, large reference-able client base and composite array of solutions make it an ideal candidate for investors seeking an exposure to the HCIT industry. Cerner offers an exposure to worldwide healthcare automation. Its international operations provide a more diversified revenue stream. In the past, the company has won contracts in the U.K. as well as in the Middle East. The company has also been working with client organizations globally, to a focus on its population health management profile.Other Stocks that Warrant a LookHere are a few other companies you may want to consider as our proven model shows that they also have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Becton, Dickinson and Company (BDX  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.41% and a Zacks Rank #2.

Notably, on an average, Stryker beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by almost 2.08% over the last four quarters. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this release.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Stryker is likely to beat estimates because it has the right combination of the two key ingredients.Zacks ESP: Stryker’s Earnings ESP is +0.66% as the Most Accurate estimate of $1.52 is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.51.

719,ALGN,"On Jul 12, we issued an updated research report on QIAGEN N.V. (QGEN  -  Free Report). The company's business is expected to get a boost from its flourishing molecular diagnostic market, international expansion, extended test menu and growth-driving strategic collaborations.Meanwhile, over the past month, shares of QIAGEN have underperformed its industry. The stock has lost 1.37% versus the industry’s 3.7% increase.Declining HPV sales in the United States persist to be a drag for QIAGEN. Slowing APAC sales also remain soft due to sluggish applied testing business.Moreover, QIAGEN is exposed to stiff competition. The company is facing a severe rivalry from firms providing similar pre-analytical solutions and other products used by its customers. This incites a fierce cut-throat contest within the industry. QIAGEN's woes are further aggravated by the highly aggressive and price sensitive markets for some of its products. Also, a heavy reliance on collaborations and declining HPV (Human papillomavirus) sales in the United States act as other negatives for this industry player.QIAGEN N.V. Price QIAGEN N.V. Price | QIAGEN N.V. QuoteOn a positive note, we are upbeat about QIAGEN's progress with the test menu expansion strategy. In April, the company announced the receipt of FDA's pre-market approval for PartoSure. In the same month, it launched QIAstat-Dx in Europe following the closure of the recently-announced Stat-Dx acquisition and the completion of defined development activities by Stat-Dx. The company is planning to launch the QIAstat-Dx  test in the United States as well as across other geographies in 2019. Additionally, QIAGEN introduced two novel liquid biopsy panels, namely AdnaTest ProstateCancerPanel AR-V7 Kit and AdnaTest LungCancer Kit.During the first quarter of 2018, QIAGEN announced receiving an approval from Japan's Ministry of Health Labor and Welfare for QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus (QFT-Plus) as an in vitro diagnostic to detect tuberculosis (TB) infection. Further, the recently-changed guidelines issued by the World Health Organization, U.S. Centers for Disease Control and International Panel Physicians Association will add an impetus to the rising popularity of proactive latent TB screening and treatment.We also look forward to the implementation of the recently-drawn strategies to boost top-line contributions from the NGS (Next Generation Sequencing) portfolio.Zacks Rank & Key PicksQIAGEN currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Better-ranked stocks from the broader Medical space include Genomic Health (GHDX  -  Free Report), Align Technology, Inc.

720,ALGN,"Home to more than half of the world’s population, Asia Pacific or APAC, has significant unmet healthcare needs and holds attractive growth potential for the MedTech bigwigs. Adding further optimism to this corner of healthcare is Trump’s clear focus on this market.Per an article published on Economic Times, the Asian healthcare market is expected to grow from $1835 billion in 2016 to more than $2660 billion by 2020. The upside can be attributed to improved access to healthcare facilities amid increased government and private investments.US-China Trade WarMeanwhile, investors are concerned about the ongoing trade dispute which can severely hurt U.S. MedTech companies’ profits in the emerging market.Accusing China of unfair trade practices, President Donald Trump has imposed tariffs on another $200 billion of imports from China just days after slapping punitive duties on $34 billion of Chinese goods. This was followed by an immediate retaliation by China, which imposed tariffs on U.S. exports of $3 billion. The blow followed Trump’s proposal of implementing tariffs on more than $500 billion worth of Chinese goods.Per an article by Christian B. Jones in Mondaq, MedTech firms in the United States currently sell $4.7 billion worth of medical devices annually to China and import a total of $5 billion.Going by a JP Morgan report, the trade war can bring collateral damage to countries closely tied to China’s supply chain, including South Korea, Taiwan, Malaysia Singapore and Thailand.India & Korea Relations Raise HopeAmid the trade-war uproar, Trump’s latest stance toward the rest of APAC has been a breather for investors. In his last landmark Asia trip, Trump revealed stronger reliance on India as a strategic partner. In fact, he sees India at the heart of his Asia policy.In keeping with this, Trump’s new policy on lowering drug prices can have a positive impact on the U.S.-India bilateral trade relations. This can further help fix prices of certain exorbitant pharmaceuticals and medical devices.An Emergo article shows that the Indian medical device market was valued at $3.5 billion in 2015 and can expand to $4.8 billion by 2019. Moreover, a Business Standard article suggests that India’s import of medical devices from the United States grew from INR61.5 billion in 2014-15 to INR74.2 billion in 2017-18.Meanwhile, U.S. ties with North Korea seem to be improving. In the recent historic summit with President Kim Jong-un, Trump put the age-old war tactics on hold with Korea.In the summit, Trump swore to provide security guarantees to the DPRK (Democratic People’s Republic of Korea) and complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.The successful nuclear talks are likely to pave the way for a mutually beneficial trading relationship beginning at some point in the future.Per data published on the Korea Country Commercial Guide, in 2017, total imports of medical devices by Korea grossed $3 billion, with the United States contributing more than $1.4 billion. Furthermore, the U.S. market share represents approximately 47% of the Korean import market.Choosing the Right StocksWhile the economy is gradually focusing on the lucrative Asia-Pacific market, it is the right time for investors to cash in on the opportunities in this market. We have shortlisted a few medical device stocks which have carved out a niche in the Asian market. Such stocks are likely to log massive gains, given their solid stand in the APAC region at present.Our first pick is Baxter International (BAX  -  Free Report) which has a solid presence in Asia, with research hubs in Japan and China. The company’s renal care team recently launched KAGUYA peritoneal dialysis technology in Japan. In 2017, Baxter completed the acquisition of India-based Claris Injectables, a global generic injectables pharmaceutical company, for almost $625 million. The buyout bolstered Baxter’s foothold in the generic pharmaceuticals space. In the same year, Baxter signed an agreement with India-based Dorizoe Lifesciences for the expansion of its generic injectables pipeline.The Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock has outperformed the industry in a year’s time. The company’s shares have rallied 22%, compared with the industry’s rise of 13.2%.

Moreover, for Align Technology, China stands second to the largest market — United States. The company also introduced a clear Aligner solution for teen Class II correction — the Invisalign Technology Teen with mandibular advancement — in certain markets of APAC.

(ISRG  -  Free Report). The Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s flagship da Vinci in general surgery and urology procedures has been witnessing consistent growth in Asia. Intuitive Surgical also saw multispecialty growth in China in the last reported quarter.Recently, additional procedures were granted reimbursement by the Ministry of Health in Japan.

721,ALGN,"In recent years, growing healthcare cognizance has led to continuous technological innovation in the dental equipment space. With time, it has emerged as the most favored sector for medical device investors looking for consistent and attractive returns. Let's delve deeper.Over the last 10 years, the dental supplies market has been faring better than the S&P 500 index. The market has gained 119.8% eclipsing the broader market's 101.4%.Per a Allied Market Research report, the global dental implants and prosthetics market is expected to catapult to a value of $12,743 million by 2023, at a CAGR of 8.8% from 2017 to 2023. And if we go by the estimates of the American Dental Association (published in Grand View Research), every year 5 million implants are carried out in the United States indicating huge market potential. In today’s fast paced times, implants are preferred over conventional removable dentures owing to comfort and convenience.Factors Driving Demand for Dental TreatmentHigh Demand Among Children and Teenagers: Per a Markets and Markets report, children and teenagers are expected to dominate the global orthodontic market in the coming years. A high number of patients with malocclusions and jaw disorders are likely to drive the demand. Also, rising need for fixed braces among children and teenagers will act as a major demand propeller. Notably, orthodontic treatments are more effective and successful in childhood or teenage.One of the noteworthy developments in this niche space is the launch of Align Technology’s clear Aligner solution for teen Class II correction — the Invisalign Technology Teen with mandibular advancement — in certain markets of Canada, EMEA and APAC in 2017.Cosmetic Needs: Growing awareness esthetic needs has also been a major growth catalyst for the dental prosthetic market.

Moreover, an increase in disposable income gives rise to higher demand for cosmetic dental surgeries.Rise in Geriatric Population: An aging population has also been a significant contributor. Higher incidence of calcium deficiency in older people leads to teeth loss. According to the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial research, more than 24% of adults aged above 74 years have lost all teeth. People on medication for chronic and metabolic disorders also reach an edentulous state.Other Factors: Poor lifestyle choices and unhygienic dental care lead to higher demand for dental procedures. Increased dental diseases are another factor. Also, dental injuries caused by road accidents lead to higher demand for dental implants and prosthetics.Technological Advancement Shapes Dental Implant MarketThe global dental implant and prosthetic market is gradually shifting from conventional to a technologically-advanced one. Laser dentistry is much in demand among dental patients because of its painless procedurefor extraction of teeth, orthodontics and periodontal decay. Per Markets and Markets, the dental lasers market is expected to scale to a value of $224.7 million by 2020, at a CAGR of 5.2% during 2015 to 2020.Dental 3D printing is a process of creating three dimensional solid dental models such as implants, surgical guides, braces, dentures, crowns and bridges, etc. Notably, 3D printing is gaining popularity as it allows dentists to carry out procedures with more precision and efficiency, saving patients from excess trauma.  Going by a report by Transparency Market Research, the global dental 3D printing market is expected to see a 16.5% CAGR from 2017 to 2025, reaching a worth of $3,427.1 million.3 Stocks in FocusWe have selected three companies, which we believe are well poised to provide impressive long-term returns given the encouraging growth prospects of the global dental implants and prosthetics market.Align Technology, Inc.

While a few lucky ones rake in the moolah, others fall victim to ad hoc strategies.One could resort to commonly used techniques to find beaten down stocks that have the potential to recover faster than others. However, even such investment choices bear the risk of disappointment. Particularly, one could be stuck in a value trap if the hidden weaknesses in selected stock are not identified.So, wouldn’t it be a safer strategy to look for stocks that are winners currently and have the potential to gain further?Here’s how to execute it:One should primarily look for stocks that are witnessing price increase. Actually, stocks seeing price strength recently have a high chance of carrying the momentum forward.If a stock is continuously moving higher, there must be a good reason for the rise or else it probably would have fallen like the losers. So, looking at stocks that have already won the game and are capable of beating the benchmark that they have set is rational.However, recent price strength alone cannot create magic. Therefore, you need to set other relevant parameters to create a successful investment strategy.Here’s how you should create the screen to shortlist the current as well as the potential winners.Screening Parameters:Percentage Change in Price (4 Weeks) greater than zero: This criterion shows that the stock has moved higher in the last four weeks.Percentage Change Price (12 Weeks) greater than 10: This indicates that the stock has seen momentum over the last three months. This lowers the risk of choosing stocks that may have drawn attention due to the overwhelming performance of the overall market in a very short period.Zacks Rank 1: No matter whether market conditions are good or bad, stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) have a proven history of outperformance. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Average Broker Rating 1: This indicates that brokers are also highly hopeful about the stock’s future performance.Current Price greater than 5: The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of $5.Current Price/ 52-Week High-Low Range more than 85%: This criterion filters stocks that are trading near their respective 52-week highs. It indicates that these are strong enough in terms of price.Here are seven of the 15 stocks that made it through this screen:Columbus McKinnon Corporation (CMCO  -  Free Report) is a broad-line designer, manufacturer and supplier of sophisticated material handling products and integrated material handling solutions that are widely distributed to industrial and consumer markets worldwide. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 13.3%.Par Pacific Holdings, Inc. (PARR  -  Free Report) manages and maintains interests in energy and infrastructure businesses.

725,ALGN,"On Oct 31, we issued an updated research report on Align Technology, Inc. (ALGN  -  Free Report). The stock currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Align Technology, which manufactures and markets a system of clear aligner therapy, intra-oral scanners and CAD/CAM (computer-aided design and manufacturing) digital services used in dentistry, orthodontics and dental records storage, has been trading above its industry over the past month. The stock has gained 26% in this period as compared to 0.9% growth of the industry. The company delivered an encouraging third quarter of 2017, posting better-than-expected earnings and revenues.We are encouraged by the company’s solid InvisAlign Technology prospects and growth in North America and internationally. The company’s receipt of two U.S. patents for SmartTrack Aligner material also buoys optimism.Moreover, Align Technology has been seeing strong international sales, especially in the EMEA and APAC regions. The third quarter marked another milestone for the company where China became the second largest market globally with United States topping the numbers. Align Technology witnessed balanced sales growth across all its channels in the recent past, primarily driven by high InvisAlign Technology case volumes. Solid performance in the summer drove Invisalign growth in the global teen market.In an encouraging development, the company recently signed a distribution agreement with Patterson Dental. Per the non-exclusive agreement, effective September 2017, Align Technology’s iTero Element intraoral scanning system will be available as part of Patterson Dental’s CAD/CAM portfolio in the United States and Canada. On the flipside, adverse foreign exchange translation continues to raise concerns for Align Technology’s international operations. Also, escalating costs and expenses are weighing on margins. Moreover, a tough competitive landscape and other macroeconomic headwinds pose a threat.Other Key PicksOther top-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are PetMed Express, Inc.

I’m Kevin Cook, your field guide and story teller for the fascinating arena of behavioral economics.Remember when you tried to pick mutual funds from a list in your employer’s retirement savings program? If you were like me, you always felt limited by the available choices, questioned the fund’s top holdings, and wondered about the manager’s skill, commitment and incentives.Even with innovations like “target date” funds, you probably felt locked-in to somebody else’s ideas about what blend of investments and risk vs return matrix would achieve the goal.Thankfully, innovation is accelerating in “fintech,” the moniker for the fast-changing field of financial technology.Among new investing platform models, we have Betterment, which, according to the company website, uses “diversification, automated rebalancing, better behavioral guardrails, and low fees” in an approach to long-term investing that can help generate 2.66% higher returns than the typical DIY investor.I like their nod to “enabling better investor behavior” and want to learn more about it. I imagine that “behavioral guardrails” might be things like preventing or warning people from taking too much risk over too short a time horizon, placing too much concentration in one sector, panicking and selling after extreme moves lower when one should be buying, or even taking cash out of retirement funds too early and incurring extremely negative penalties and tax consequences.Wealthfront is a similar new enterprise that says “Our investment strategies may be sophisticated, but our philosophy is simple. Technology can do some things better than people.”They claim using software, they can better execute time-tested investment strategies that ultimately reduce risk, reduce taxes and reduce fees. I am also keen to share this self-description on the Wealthfront website:“Fortune favors the smart, not the bold. Picking stocks and chasing market fluctuations may be exciting. But when it comes to long-term investing, you can't expect to outperform the market.”So what’s their solution? Indexing, which simply means parking your money in a diversified portfolio of low-cost index funds and having the patience to stay the course.Wealthfront says “It was a radical idea when economist Burton Malkiel first introduced it. He’s a smart guy, Burt. So smart we made him Wealthfront’s Chief Investment Officer.”Now here’s where it gets interesting for me. While I like the idea of people having more choices to grow their retirement savings, I am also an active investor, stock-picker and trader at heart, as are most of the followers of my newsletters at Zacks.And Burton Malkiel is the progenitor of a philosophy that runs counter to my beliefs: that the markets are too random to succeed as a stock-picker and that you should invest in index mutual funds.The author of the classic finance book A Random Walk Down Wall Street is the leading proponent of the efficient-market hypothesis, which contends that prices of publicly traded assets reflect all publicly available information.I respect Wealthfront’s approach and believe that it will be a good solution for millions who don't care, or can’t make the time, to research stocks and mutual funds.But I’ll also stick with my belief for myself and my followers that I can indeed beat the market over many time frames, from one year to twenty. More on that coming up in a 1-minute video investing lesson I made last month.Introducing the AI-Powered Platform Called qplumIn this episode of Mind Over Money, we’re going to focus on a new platform called qplum (yes, all lower-case). I learned more about it through the NVIDIA (NVDA  -  Free Report) AI Podcast, episode #26 from last June, to be precise, where host Michael Copeland interviewed qplum co-founder Guarav Chakravorty.The AI Podcast seems to be where I learn a lot of new things these days. And that’s not just because I am an enthusiastic NVDA investor but also that I find the future of machine learning and deep learning technologies so exciting.In Copeland’s 40 episodes since he started last November, he has created a library of fascinating interviews on exciting topics involving the bleeding edge of technology. I consider it a must-listen podcast!Back to qplum who claims “Investing can now be a science and not a game.”And to achieve this goal, they are using “dynamic AI strategies and protecting against downturns.”In describing their core investment beliefs on the company website, the qplum team says “We believe in the mathematics of data-driven decision-making, the science of behavioral economics, and the art of effective communication.”qplum emphasizes that they are offering investing strategies, not products. And those products are coming from a data scientist and engineer, Chakravorty, who spent the start of his career building machine learning models before he took finance classes at Wharton that inspired him to bring the two worlds together.Contrary to Wall Street hedge funds that hire quantitative PhDs to build complex investing and trading algorithms, qplum “taught” their AI to learn on market data what works best in the long-term if given the chance to re-balance a portfolio every day. From the qplum website...“We utilize the best practices and processes of institutional investors to manage your wealth. Rather than making one or two great predictions, we expose the portfolio to many growth opportunities.”Avoiding the Downturns, SystematicallyIn addition to low fees and costs, they also have a unique risk management model to prevent compounding of losses during market slides, which could potentially turn into bigger and longer downturns. Plus, the firm offers four different strategies based on risk tolerance and time horizon.One thing I don't make perfectly clear in my podcast is how qplum only uses ETFs in their investment strategies. And with a selection of nearly two-dozen ETFs in their pool, they can employ tax efficient strategies of loss capture and still be in the market when the model says it should be.Be sure to listen to my Mind Over Money podcast attached to this article to learn more about the exciting AI-powered investing approach of qplum, where I also challenge the company’s “scientific” approach to markets in the vein of “if everybody does this, will it still work?”This is an important question to ask when dealing with the infinite complexity and “wild randomness” of social beasts like markets. As I like to say since reading The Black Swan by Nassim Nicholas Taleb, who taught us about the severe limits of standard deviation in measuring market risk, “When anything can happen, there is no standard for deviation.”I’m looking forward to learning more about qplum and hope to have Mr. Chakravorty or another company representative on the Mind Over Money podcast.Three Great Resources From Last Week’s EpisodeNow I want to make sure you have some resources that I only briefly mentioned in last week’s episode about deep learning.First up is the Time.com article How College Students Should Prepare for Our Automated Future by Joseph Aoun.Aoun is president of Northeastern University and the author of Robot-Proof: Higher Education in the Age of Artificial Intelligence, copyright 2017 by MIT Press.Next is my recent report on Tesla (TSLA  -  Free Report). I was a Tesla bear a year ago when he “bailed-in” his company SolarCity.But I didn’t understand his company’s commitment to developing the next iteration of their electric consumer vehicle, the Model 3.The revenue ramp that is coming in the next year could send Tesla stock to new highs over $400.

729,ALGN,"Abbott’s (ABT  -  Free Report) Medical Devices business has been going strong of late on solid sub-segmental performance.We expect this strength to get reflected in second-quarter 2018 results, which are scheduled for release on Jul 18 before the market opens.Click here to know how the company’s overall Q2 performance is expected to be.Medical Devices in FocusAbbott’s Medical Devices segment presently comprises the new Cardiovascular and Neuromodulation, Heart Failure, Electrophysiology, Structural Heart, Rhythm Management, Vascular businesses along with the Diabetes Care business.Abbott Laboratories Price and EPS Surprise Abbott Laboratories Price and EPS Surprise | Abbott Laboratories QuoteManagement expects mid-to-high single digit growth in Medical Devices second-quarter 2018 sales along with continued double-digit growth at certain sub-segments.Consequently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Medical Devices revenues in the United States of $1.29 billion indicates a rise of 8.4% from the year-ago quarter. Internationally, our consensus estimate of $1.59 billion shows growth of 12.8%.In the last quarter, sales improvement at the segment was driven by double-digit growth in Electrophysiology, Neuromodulation and Diabetes Care. Moreover, the company received approvals for a few products alongside achieving clinical trial milestones.Let's see how things are shaping up within these sub-segments before the second-quarter results.Electrophysiology, which accounted for 14.2% of Medical Devices revenues, has been gaining strongly from the recent launch of Confirm insertable cardiac heart monitor in the United States and Europe. Furthermore, continued uptake of EnSite Precision Cardiac Mapping System is expected to contribute strongly to the top line in the second quarter.Abbott strengthened its position in the business with the successive receipt of FDA and CE Mark  for its new Advisor HD Grid Mapping Catheter. The company has launched the product in 20 countries since then and currently awaits the commercial launch in the United States.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Electrophysiology revenues of $408 million indicates an increase of 19% from a year ago. The company is expected to keep gaining strength in this business.In the last reported quarter, the company witnessed impressive sales growth in the Heart Failure business on solid uptake of the recently launched HeartMate 3 system in the United States.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Heart Failure business revenues of $168 million indicates a rise of 5.7% from the year-ago quarter.Providing an impetus to the Vascular (26.9% of total Medical Devices revenues) business in the United States, Abbott recently announced the receipt of FDA approval for XIENCE Sierra.We encouragingly note, under the Vascular business, the company has seen a slew of developments with regard to its XIENCE Sierra coronary stent system. The company also achieved national reimbursement for XIENCE Sierra in May 2018. The company has also been getting positive responses for the XIENCE Sierra coronary stent system post its launch in Europe.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Vascular revenues of $740 million shows an improvement of 1.2% from the year-ago quarter.The Structural Heart business has maintained an impressive top-line performance. In the last reported quarter, this business accounted for 10.7% of total revenues under the broader Medical Devices segment. The upside was led by continued double-digit growth of MitraClip.In March, Abbott announced the receipt of national reimbursement in Japan for the same. Notably, in nearly 50 countries, more than 50,000 people have been treated with MitraClip.Further, the company announced the receipt of FDA approval for the world’s smallest rotatable, bileaflet mechanical heart valve — Masters HP 15mm. With the approval, the company has expanded the Masters Series portfolio under Structural Heart.All these positive developments are expected to boost top-line contributions from this sub-segment in the to-be-reported quarter. Our estimate for Structural Heart revenues of $293 million also indicates a rise of 9.3% from the year-ago quarter.In Diabetes Care, international sales growth of 44.2% in the prior quarter was driven by Abbott’s FreeStyle Libre. The company recently initiated the launch of FreeStyleLibre in the United States as well.Proceeding with initiatives to boost this arm, the company announced the availability of FreeStyle LibreLink app in Europe for use in smartphones (both iPhone and Android).The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Diabetes Care revenues of $460 million indicates a surge of 36.9% from the year-ago quarter.Meanwhile,we are upbeat about Abbott kick-starting 2018 with the receipt of FDA approval for magnetic resonance (MR)-conditional labeling for Quadra Assura MP Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy Defibrillator (CRT-D) and Fortify Assura Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator (ICD) — two of the company's most widely-used high voltage medical devices.The approvals come on the heels of recent MR-conditional labeling approvals for the Assurity MRI pacemaker, Ellipse ICD and associated MRI-compatible leads.

730,ALGN,"Now that a volley of Q2 earnings releases is around the corner, every investor must be looking for stocks that can beat market expectation. This is because investors always try to position themselves ahead of time and look to tap stocks that are high-quality in nature.Why Is a Positive Earnings Surprise So Important?Historically, stocks of companies with solid quarterly earnings (on a nominal basis) tank if they miss or merely meet market expectations. After all, a 20% earnings rise (though apparently looks good) doesn’t tell you if earnings growth has been exhibiting a decelerating trend.Also, seasonal fluctuations come into play sometimes. If a company’s Q1 is seasonally weak and Q4 strong, then it is likely to report a sequential earnings decline. In such cases, growth rates are misleading while judging the true health of a company.On the other hand, after much brainstorming and analysis of companies’ financials and initiatives, Wall Street analysts project earnings of companies. They in fact club their insights and a company’s guidance when deriving an earnings estimate.Thus, outperforming that estimate is almost equivalent to beating the company’s own expectation as well as the market perception. And if the margin of earnings surprise is big, it typically drives the stock higher right after the release. Thus, more than anything else, an earnings surprise can push a stock higher.How to Find Stocks that Can Beat?Now, finding stocks that have the potential to beat on the bottom line may be investors’ dream but not an easy job. One way to do this is to look at the earnings surprise history of the company.An impressive track in this regard generally acts as a catalyst in sending a stock higher. It indicates the company’s ability to surpass estimates. And investors generally believe that the company will apply the same secret sauce to execute yet another earning beat in its next release.The Winning StrategyIn order to shortlist stocks that are likely to come up with an earnings surprise, we chose the following as our primary screening parameters.Last EPS Surprise greater than or equal to 10%: Stocks delivering positive surprise in the last quarter tend to surprise again.Average EPS Surprise in the last four quarters greater than 20%: We lifted the bar for outperformance slight higher by setting the average earnings surprise for the last four quarters at 20%.Average EPS Surprise in the last two quarters greater than 20%: This points to a more consistent surprise history and makes the case for another surprise even stronger.In addition, we place a few other criteria that push up the chance of a positive surprise.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Only companies with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) rating can get through.Earnings ESP greater than zero: A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank of #1, 2 or 3 for an earnings beat to happen, as per our proven model.In order to zero in on those that have long-term growth potential and high trading liquidity we have added the following parameters too:Next 3–5 Years Estimated EPS Growth (Per Year) greater than 10%: Solid expected earnings growth exhibits the stock’s long-term growth prospects.Average 20-day Volume greater than 100,000: High trading volume implies that the stocks have adequate liquidity.A handful of criteria has narrowed down the universe from over 7,700 stocks to 13.Here are five out of 13 stocks:Deckers Outdoor Corporation (DECK  -  Free Report)): This is a global leader in designing and distributing innovative footwear, apparel and accessories developed for both everyday casual lifestyle use and high performance activities.

733,ALGN,"On Jul 6, we issued an updated research report on Medtronic plc (MDT  -  Free Report). While we are encouraged by the company’s global accepted advanced therapies, its escalating costs and expenses raise concerns. The stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Over the past three months, shares of Medtronic have outperformed the industry. The stock has grown 9.2% compared with the industry’s 8.8% rise.Notably, Medtronic exited fiscal 2018 on a solid note with better-than-expected fourth-quarter performances. All major business groups contributed to its solid top-line growth at CER, highlighting sustainability across groups and regions in addition to displaying a successful integration and achievement of synergy targets. Also, a gradually stabilizing Cardiac Rhythm & Heart Failure (CRHF) market buoys optimism on the stock.The receipt of FDA approval for the DBS (Deep Brain Stimulation) therapy as an adjunctive treatment to reduce partial-onset seizures raises hope for the company in the target medical market. Medtronic is also focusing on geographical diversification of its businesses. The company is highly positive about its foray into the $1-billion standalone CGM (continuous glucose monitoring) market with its Guardian Connect.We are currently upbeat about the latest FDA nod to its MiniMed 670G system for patients with type 1 diabetes between seven and 13 years of age.Significantly, Medtronic’s new restructuring initiative — Enterprise Excellence plan — is aimed at $3-billion annual growth run rate savings by the end of fiscal 2022. Per the company, this new program has been designed to increase its effectiveness and growth-related reinvestment ability along with providing a consistent boost to its margin expansion as well as driving the EPS leverage.On the flip side, the company has been exposed to steep costs and expenses, weighing heavily on its margins. Also, its 2019 guidance remains conservative on the apprehension of lackluster Cardiac and Vascular Group (CVG) plus Minimally Invasive Therapies Group (MITG) performances. This in turn, dampens investors’ confidence in the stock.Key PicksA few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Genomic Health (GHDX  -  Free Report), Align Technology, Inc.

734,ALGN,"Boston Scientific Corporation (BSX  -  Free Report) recently announced the acquisition of Cryterion Medical, Inc. — a privately-held developer of a single-shot cryoablation platform for the treatment of atrial fibrillation.Through this acquisition, Boston Scientific will become the only company to boast a comprehensive portfolio, covering both the cryothermal and radiofrequency single-shot, balloon-based ablation therapies.Cryterion Medical plans to submit the clinical evidence from the ongoing study of its cryoablation system to get the CE Mark in early 2019. Further, the company plans to submit an investigational device exemption application to the FDA to seek regulatory approval in the United States.Financial Terms of the DealBoston Scientific has an existing investment in Cryterion Medical and is going to make a net upfront payment of approximately $202 million in cash for the remaining stake of around 65%.However, the transaction is not expected to be accretive to the company’s adjusted earnings per share through 2020.Glimpse of EP BusinessBoston Scientific’s EP business develops less-invasive medical technologies to diagnose and treat disorders of heart rate as well as rhythm.In first-quarter 2018, revenues in this division improved 11.5% year over year to $75 million, organically. The upside was driven by the higher uptake of the new RHYTHMIA HDx platform. Management continues to roll out the HDx platform in Europe and it recently launched the platform in the United States as well as Japan.Overall, the company continues to expand the toolkit that supports RHYTHMIA HDx, providing ablation technologies that match the excellence of its Mapping System. Additionally, it focuses on adding tools that expand the reach and utility of RHYTHMIA HDx in different procedures.Moreover, to expand its EP business, Boston Scientific recently announced the acquisition of Securus Medical Group, Inc — a privately-held developer of the thermal monitoring system for the continuous measurement of esophageal temperature.Market PotentialBoston Scientific’s strategy to boost the EP business seems to be aligned with data provided by Allied Market Research.  Per the report, the global cardiac monitoring and cardiac rhythm management market is expected to reach a value of $32,216 million from 2016 to 2022, at a CAGR of 7.6%.Per the company, the global EP market is expected to worth $5 billion in 2018. Further, growing at double digits, single-shot ablation therapies are estimated to be the most rapidly growing sub-segment within the EP market.Thus, the addition of the single-shot cryoablation platform will help Boston Scientific cash in on the abundant opportunities in the global cardiac monitoring and cardiac rhythm management market.Share Price PerformanceBoston Scientific has been gaining investors’ confidence on consistently positive results. Over the past three months, shares of the company have outperformed its broader industry.

735,ALGN,"Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.  (BIO  -  Free Report) has been gaining investor confidence on consistently positive results. Over the past six months, the company’s share price has outperformed its industry. The stock has gained 17.5% compared with 3.7% growth of the industry. Also, the company has outperformed the S&P 500’s 1% fall.This renowned manufacturer and global supplier of clinical diagnostics and life science research products in the healthcare, analytical chemistry life science research and other markets has a market cap of $8.73 billion.

In the past 60 days, two analysts revised estimates upward, with no movement in the opposite direction. Resultantly, earnings estimates increased around 8.2% to $6.20 per share.Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year revenues of $2.30 billion reflects an improvement of 6.4% year over year.Let’s find out whether the recent positive trend is a sustainable one.Solid Global ProspectsIn first-quarter 2018, Bio-Rad derived around 62% of its net sales globally. While Europe happens to be the largest international market for the company, first-quarter revenue growth in the region was apparently sluggish. Offsetting this softness, Bio-Rad performed reasonably well, primarily in North America, China and the Asia-Pacific region.Growth in All LinesBio-Rad witnessed sales growth across all channels in the first quarter. Sales in the Life Science segment were driven by higher demand for Droplet Digital PCR, process chromatography and cell biology product lines. Further, rising net sales at the Clinical Diagnostics indicated growth in immunology, diabetes and quality control product lines.Impressive Synergies From RainDanceBio-Rad completed the acquisition of RainDance Technologies, Inc. in February 2017. The acquired entity was integrated into its Life Science segment in a bid to solidify its position in the Droplet Digital PCR space.Further, Bio-Rad has begun to realize synergies from the RainDance acquisition. In first-quarter 2018, Bio-Rad recorded $6 million of RainDance sales in comparison to $2 million in the previous year. The company has also been witnessing solid growth in the sales of Droplet Digital PCR.Solid Balance SheetEffective capital deployment has been one of the key contributors to EPS growth. Bio-Rad exited the first quarter of 2018 with cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $768.5 million compared with $760.5 million at the end of 2017. Other Key PicksSome other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Genomic Health (GHDX  -  Free Report), Align Technology, Inc.

736,ALGN,"On Jul 2, we initiated a research report on Insulet Corporation (PODD  -  Free Report). We are upbeat about the company’s achievement of two milestones with respect to expansion of Omnipod’s market reach, while a tough competitive landscape raises concern. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).This leading developer, manufacturer and marketer of the Omnipod Insulin Management System has been outperforming its industry over the past year. The stock has gained 68.1% versus the industry’s 10.3% rise. Insulet kick-started 2018 with positive reimbursement updates. To begin with, CMS issued guidance in January which required Omnipod to be covered under the Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit program.Moreover, effective Apr 1, Express Scripts and Magellan, two of the Medicare Part D plan sponsors, added Omnipod as a covered benefit. Starting April 2018, Insulet received access to in-network coverage of Omnipod with UnitedHealthcare.Insulet has also taken over its new role as a direct seller of Omnipod System in Europe starting Jul 1. The company is confident about the infrastructure and believes it is well positioned to cash in on the rapidly-growing European customer base.We are also upbeat about the year-over-year revenue growth in the last reported quarter on solid uptake of Omnipod System in the United States and other geographies. Expanding global customer base along with consistent strength across all markets drove revenues.Meanwhile, Insulet operates in a highly competitive environment, dominated by firms ranging from large multinational corporations with significant resources to start-ups. Also, the competitive and regulatory conditions in the markets where the company operates limit Insulet’s ability to switch to strategies like price increases. The company’s Omnipod System primarily competes with Medtronic plc’s (MDT) market-leading MiniMed system.Also, the company is exposed to risks associated with a weaker global economy and lower reimbursement rates.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Genomic Health (GHDX  -  Free Report), Align Technology, Inc.

740,ALGN,"Align Technology, Inc’s (ALGN  -  Free Report) strategy of international expansion gets a solid impetus with the company achieving a new landmark in Invisalign adoption. The company announced that it has completed the shipment of one million cases in the Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) region.Per Align, this is a significant milestone for the company reflecting accelerated adoption of Invisalign clear aligner therapy.Align noted that the one millionth Invisalign patient in EMEA is 24-year old Julia Leibold from Freiburg, Germany. Julia is being treated with the Invisalign Comprehensive Package, changing her aligners on a weekly basis.Following this new breakthrough, Align will launch a pro bono campaign in July when it will work with doctors across the EMEA belt to offer Invisalign treatment to multiple patients with disabilities.Align’s Intenrational Profile at a Glance Align has undertaken several strategies to improve adoption of Invisalign Technology globally including product/technology development, extending clinical efficacy and extension of the Invisalign technology brand.In recent times, the company’s international Invisalign volumes trend has consistently remained strong with 43.4% growth registered during the first quarter of 2018. This reflected a continued strong performance in both EMEA and APAC regions.In EMEA, first-quarter volumes were up 36.6% on solid adoption of Invisalign Technology in the markets of Iberia and France as well as owing to rapid growth in smaller markets like Eastern Europe and Central Europe along with Benelux. In the Asia-Pacific zone, the company witnessed 56.1% surge in first-quarter volume, led by China, Japan and Australia.While China stood close as the second largest market after the United States for Align, Iberia followed as the third largest destination. The international teen case soared 60% year over year in the same quarter. Notably, it is the sixth straight quarter when Invisalign teenage patient base grew faster than the adult patient population.Not only that, the company of late accomplished a new feat with respect to its Invisalign Teen treatment options. It introduced a clear Aligner solution for teen Class II correction — the Invisalign Technology Teen with mandibular advancement — in certain markets of Canada, EMEA and APAC in 2017. The FDA approval for the same is expected in the second half of 2018.These developments are indicative of the growing popularity of Align’s dental products in the foreign markets.

744,ALGN,"It is not surprising that before an earnings season, every investor looks for stocks that can beat market expectation. This is because investors always try to position themselves ahead of time and look to tap stocks that are of high quality in nature.Why Is a Positive Earnings Surprise So Important?Historically, stocks of companies with solid quarterly earnings (on a nominal basis) tank if they miss or merely meet market expectations. After all, a 20% earnings rise (though apparently looks good) doesn’t tell you if earnings growth has been exhibiting a decelerating trend.Also, seasonal fluctuations come into play sometimes. If a company’s Q1 is seasonally weak and Q4 strong, then it is likely to report a sequential earnings decline. In such cases, growth rates are misleading while judging the true health of a company.On the other hand, after much brainstorming and analysis of companies’ financials and initiatives, Wall Street analysts project earnings of companies. They in fact club their insights and a company’s guidance when deriving an earnings estimate.Thus, outperforming that estimate is almost equivalent to beating the company’s own expectation as well as the market perception. And if the margin of earnings surprise is big, it typically drives the stock higher right after the release. Thus, more than anything else, an earnings surprise can push a stock higher.How to Find Stocks that Can Beat?Now, finding stocks that have the potential to beat on the bottom line may be investors’ dream but not an easy job. One way to do this is to look at the earnings surprise history of the company.An impressive track in this regard generally acts as a catalyst in sending a stock higher. It indicates the company’s ability to surpass estimates. And investors generally believe that the company will apply the same secret sauce to execute yet another earning beat in its next release.The Winning StrategyIn order to shortlist stocks that are likely to come up with an earnings surprise, we chose the following as our primary screening parameters.Last EPS Surprise greater than or equal to 10%: Stocks delivering positive surprise in the last quarter tend to surprise again.Average EPS Surprise in the last four quarters greater than 20%: We lifted the bar for outperformance slight higher by setting the average earnings surprise for the last four quarters at 20%.Average EPS Surprise in the last two quarters greater than 20%: This points to a more consistent surprise history and makes the case for another surprise even stronger.In addition, we place a few other criteria that push up the chance of a positive surprise.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Only companies with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) rating can get through.Earnings ESP greater than zero: A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank of #1, 2 or 3 for an earnings beat to happen, as per our proven model.In order to zero in on those that have long-term growth potential and high trading liquidity we have added the following parameters too:Next 3–5 Years Estimated EPS Growth (Per Year) greater than 10%: Solid expected earnings growth exhibits the stock’s long-term growth prospects.Average 20-day Volume greater than 100,000: High trading volume implies that the stock has adequate liquidity.A handful of criteria has narrowed down the universe from over 7,700 stocks to 12.Here are five out of the 12 stocks:Weight Watchers International Inc (WTW  -  Free Report): This Zacks Rank #1 stock is the largest provider of weight-control programs in the world. The stock belongs to a top-ranked Zacks industry (top 31%).J.Jill Inc. (JILL  -  Free Report): The Zacks Rank #2 company operates as a specialty retailer of women’s apparel.

745,ALGN,"Trump’s protectionist stance on trade led to sluggish trading on Wall Street. This is especially true, as a series of tariff talks between the United States and its other major allies are intensifying fears of a trade war and could even trigger a global recession.Tariff TalksTrade war fears surfaced in March when Trump levied a 25% tariff on steel and aluminum imports on countries around the world. The action has prompted a retaliatory action from U.S. allies and tit-for-tat import tariffs.The turmoil intensified in recent weeks when Trump unveiled the list of Chinese goods worth $50 billion targeted for a 25% tariff, leading to retaliation from China with duties of “the same scale and strength.” In response, the United States again threatened to impose tariffs of up to $400 billion on Chinese goods on top of the $50 billion worth goods. Tariffs on $34 billion worth of Chinese goods, the first of a potential total of $450 billion are due to take effect on Jul 6.Additionally, the latest report from the Wall Street revealed that Trump is seeking to bar many Chinese companies from investing in U.S. technology firms and block additional technology exports to China.The trade dispute with European Union (EU) also deepened on Jun 22 after Trump tweeted that he would impose another 25% tariff, targeting imported autos from the European Union. The response came following the EU’s threat of 25% duties on $3.2 billion worth of American goods exported to the 28-member bloc, starting Jun 22, against U.S. tariffs on European steel and aluminum.Canada and Mexico have also threatened against the use of American steel and aluminum imports. Canada is seeking duties on steel imports from the United States and on other goods including playing cards, inflatable boats, yogurt and toilet papers. The total value of American goods subject to tariff is $12.8 billion, effective Jul 1. Mexico plans to retaliate by targeting products from congressional districts that Trump’s Republican Party is fighting to retain in the November election. It would impose levies on a wide range of U.S. goods, some steel and pipe products, lamps, berries, grapes, apples, cold cuts, pork chops and various cheese products “up to an amount comparable to the level of damage” linked to U.S. tariffs.Market ImpactThe round of sanctions and retaliation has intensified the fears of a global trade war that would hurt the worldwide economy and corporate profits, particularly at big U.S. exporters. As such, large-cap stocks are struggling for the past three months given their substantial exposure to these countries.However, there are still winners in many corners of the large-cap space that are easily surviving the trade turmoil. Below, we have highlighted five stocks from different corners of the market that have gained more than 40% in three months and have a solid Zacks Rank  #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). These stocks also have a market cap of at least $10 billion.Lululemon Athletica Inc.

747,ALGN,"Abbott Laboratories (ABT  -  Free Report) reported second-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings from continuing operations of 62 cents per share, 3.3% higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate and up 12.7% year over year. This adjusted quarterly number also remained ahead of the company’s guidance range of 59 cents to 61 cents.Reported earnings for the quarter came in at 15 cents per share, way below the year-ago number of 40 cents.Second-quarter worldwide sales came in at $6.63 billion, up 24.4% year over year on a reported basis. This quarterly figure also remains slightly ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.62 billion.On a comparable operational basis (adjusting the impact of foreign exchange, certain acquisitions and divestments), sales increased 2.9% year over year in the reported quarter.Abbott Laboratories Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Abbott Laboratories Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Abbott Laboratories QuoteQuarter in DetailAbbott Labs operates through four segments – Established Pharmaceuticals Division (EPD), Medical Devices, Nutrition and Diagnostics.EPD sales were up 4.1% on a reported basis (up 3.5% on comparable operational basis) to $1,021 billion. There was a positive impact of 0.6% on the back of currency fluctuations. Sales in key emerging markets increased 5.8% (up 4.6%), driven by strong growth in Russia, China and several countries across Latin America. However, this positive effect was partially offset by the impact associated with implementation of a new Goods and Services Tax (GST) system in India.The Medical Devices business sales spiked 89.2% on a reported basis to $2.59 billion. However, on a comparable operational basisexcluding the impact from the favorable resolution of a third-party royalty agreement last year, sales increased 3.2%.Cardiovascular and Neuromodulation sales soared 189% on a reported basis (up 0.9% on comparable operational basis) on growth in Electrophysiology, Structural Heart and Neuromodulation. Vascular product sales were up 6%, while Structural Heart business grew 9.1% year over yearon a comparable operational basis.Diabetes Care sales improved 18.7% on a reported basis (up 21.3%), driven by double-digit international sales growth, led by continued consumer uptake of FreeStyle Libre — the revolutionary continuous glucose monitoring system of Abbott Labs.Nutrition sales slipped 0.6% year over year on a reported basis (up 0.5% on a comparable operational basis). Unfavorable foreign exchange impacted sales by a marginal 1.1%. Pediatric Nutrition sales increased 2.5% on a comparable operational basis. Adult Nutrition sales however, decreased 2% on a comparable operational basis.Diagnostics sales rose 3.8% year over year (up 5.4% on a comparable operational basis). While Core Laboratory sales increased 6.1%, Point of Care Diagnostics sales grew 8.9%, both on a comparable operational basis. Molecular Diagnostics sales were down 4.1% as strong growth in the infectious disease testing business was partially offset by the planned scale-down of the genetics business.2017 GuidanceAbbott Labs raised its full-year 2017 guidance. The company forecasts earnings per share from continuing operations to remain within the range of $1.03 to $1.13 from earlier range of 92 cents to $1.02. Adjusting certain net specified items for the full year, the adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations are expected to stay within a band of $2.43-$2.53 (earlier guidance was $2.40-$2.50). The current Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $2.47, at the midpoint of the projected range.Our TakeOne more time, Abbott Labs successfully exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both earnings and sales front. We are optimistic about the company’s strong and consistent EPD and Medical Devices performance. However, these strong performances were to some extent offset by sluggish Nutrition business.However, the company stands to benefit from the recently completed acquisition of St. Jude Medical, which has already started offering it an industry leading pipeline across cardiovascular, neuromodulation, diabetes and vision care. Looking forward to achieving synergy benefits, the company has raised its 2017 outlook buoying investors’ confidence on the stock.In 2017, the company plans to execute its existing operating model which focuses on selling portfolio in core therapeutic areas. This will lead to the creation of unique channel opportunities in differentiated relationships with physicians, retailers and pharmacies, looking to offer a complete line of solutions to treat prominent local health conditions. Also, Abbott Labs has plans to beef up its development capabilities with an expanded EPD innovation center in India.However, India’s transition to new tax system has significantly hampered growth during the reported quarter. Per the company, if this transitory impact of a new GST could be eliminated, the total EPD sales would have grown in the high-single digits in the reported quarter.Abbott Labs currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Stocks to ConsiderBetter-ranked medical stocks are Mesa Laboratories, Inc. (MLAB  -  Free Report), INSYS Therapeutics, Inc. (INSY  -  Free Report) and Align Technology, Inc. (ALGN  -  Free Report).

Adjusted earnings per diluted share for the second quarter are estimated in the band of $1.70 to $1.74, representing growth of 8% to 11% on a year-over-year basis. Furthermore, the company anticipates compounded annual EBITDA growth in the band of 2% to 4% from 2017 through 2020 for the core PBM business.Favorable Macroeconomic Scenario: We expect Express Scripts to continue to benefit from increased generic utilization, shift toward mail orders, strong specialty growth and an aging population in the U.S. Branded drugs are becoming increasingly expensive due to double-digit brand inflation. Thus, continued rise in the price of specialty drugs and increased regulatory burden has been driving demand for generics, a key catalyst for the company.Cutthroat Competition in Niche Space: On the flipside, Express Scripts faces intense competition in the PBM industry. The company faces competition from independent PBMs like MedImpact and Navitus Health Solutions. Moreover, the niche space is dominated by players like CVS, Aetna and Cigna, among others. We expect intensifying competition to mar second-quarter revenues.Estimate Revision Trend: Express Scripts’ estimate revision trend lacks luster at the moment. For the current quarter, one analyst moved south, compared to no upward revision in the last two months. In fact, over the last three months, the current quarter estimates declined almost 1.2% to $1.71 per share.Probable Loss of Biggest Customer: Although it is too early to gauge the losses, Express Scripts is on the verge of losing its biggest customer – leading health insurer Anthem Inc. (ANTM). Following a series of legal conundrum, Anthem is no longer expected to extend its pharmacy-benefits management agreement withExpress Scripts, which is slated for expiration by 2019-end. Per management, Express Scripts might lose almost 50% of its revenues related to the Anthem contract by the second quarter itself.Earnings WhispersBuoyed by the above factors, our proven model does not conclusively show that Express Scripts is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat estimates. This is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP:The Earnings ESP for Express Scripts is -0.59% as the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at $1.70, while and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at $1.71. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Express Scripts currently carries a Zacks Rank #3. Though a favorable Zacks Rank increases the predictive power of ESP, the company’s negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Meanwhile, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks that Warrant a LookHere are a few companies you may want to consider as our proven model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Becton, Dickinson and Company (BDX  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.41% and a Zacks Rank #2.

749,ALGN,"We expect Align Technology, Inc. (ALGN  -  Free Report) to beat expectations when it reports second-quarter 2017 earnings on Jul 27, after market close.Last quarter, the company had posted a positive earnings surprise of 26.87%. It is worth noting that Align Technology has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the preceding four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 19.89%. Let’s take a look at how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Align Technology is likely to beat earnings because it has the perfect combination of two key ingredients.Zacks ESP:  Align Technology has an Earnings ESP of +1.37% as the Most Accurate estimate is at 74 cents while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged lower at 73 cents. A favorable Zacks ESP serves as a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Align Technology currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Note that stocks with Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 or 3 (Hold) have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings estimates.Conversely, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.The combination of Align Technology’s Zacks Rank #2 and +1.37% ESP makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.What’s Driving the Better-Than-Expected Earnings?We are upbeat about Align Technology’s execution of strategic initiatives like international expansion, thereby ensuring Invisalign treatment for a growing base of patients. In this context, the company strengthened its foothold internationally by acquiring the Invisalign distributors in the highly lucrative Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) region as well as Brazil in Feb 2017. This is likely to drive the company’s results in the to-be-reported quarter.In May, the company announced the receipt of two U.S. patents for Align’s SmartTrack aligner material that is exclusively used for Invisalign aligner treatment. Moreover, in a bid to gain traction in the Invisalign platform, Align collaborated with Digital Smile Design in March. Post-collaboration, Align’s Invisalign clear aligner treatment can be used by dentists during tooth alignment procedures along with Smile Design protocols.Align Technology, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Align Technology, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Align Technology, Inc. QuoteNotably, to expand its Invisalign brand offerings, Align Technology introduced a patient-friendly solution – Invisalign Teen with mandibular advancement – for teens in March. According to the company, this advancement will help it offer more options for teen treatment which might boost its top line in the yet-to-be reported quarter. Recently, the company expanded work flow options of its leading iTero scanners. In this context, Align collaborated with exocad GmbH in March, whereby the integrated portfolio will result in high-tech workflow solution for efficient scanning, design and manufacturing of in-house dental prosthesis. In February, the company had announced the addition of digital workflow for Nobel Biocare implants to its iTero intraoral scanner portfolio.Moreover, the company saw increased adoption of iTero scanners for Invisalign case submissions instead of PVS impressions especially in North America, thereby driving Invisalign utilization. Management expects this bullish trend to likely continue in the yet-to-be reported quarter.Notably, for second-quarter 2017, the company projects earnings per share of 71−74 cents on revenues of $340–$345 million. The company also expects Invisalign case shipments in the band of 221,000 to 224,000, up 25–27% from a year ago.On the flip side, unfavorable foreign currency might affect the company’s revenues in the to-be-reported quarter. Also, the company is exposed to seasonal demand fluctuations, higher operating expenses pertaining to increased head count along with higher investments targeted toward growth acceleration in geographical expansion and portfolio expansionOther Stocks to ConsiderHere are some other companies you may consider as our model shows that they also have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in the upcoming quarter:Becton, Dickinson and Company (BDX  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.41% and a Zacks Rank #2.

On account of the data provided by American Cancer Society, nearly 1.7 million people are likely to be diagnosed with cancer in the U.S. in 2017. In this regard, Quest Diagnostics is taking strategic steps to capture the market.According to Markets and Markets, the global cancer diagnostics market is expected to reach a worth of $13.1 billion by 2020, and is poised to see a CAGR of 12.9% during the of 2015 to 2020 period.

Also, the company’s earnings topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the last four quarters with an average beat of 4.34%.Delving deeper into the fundamentals of the stock, let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this release.Factors at PlayWe believe that the growing adoption of the company’s flagship Lutonix drug coated-balloon (DCB) will continue to be the key growth catalyst in the to-be-reported quarter. In this regard, Lutonix DCB is used to treat patients suffering from peripheral arterial disease (PAD). Within the Endovascular business, peripheral PTA line sales are solely driven by accelerating demand for the Lutonix DCB in the U.S. We expect to see this product to significantly contribute to the company’s top line in this quarter.Furthermore, the company's investments in emerging markets have strengthened its position internationally. We are also upbeat on the solid contribution from the company’s vascular product line. The urology and oncology segments are likely to drive second-quarter sales.On the flip side, a challenging Med-tech environment, especially in the hernia fixation and peripheral stent businesses raises concerns. The company continues to witness significant pricing pressure as well. Also, unfavorable foreign currency will continue to hurt top- and bottom-line growth.Furthermore, uncertainties associated with the possibilities of a repeal of the Affordable Care Act under President Trump add to the company’s concerns.Earnings WhispersOur quantitative model doesn’t point to an earnings beat either this quarter.

However, GNC Holdings’ trailing four-quarter earnings average lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 20.5%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayGNC Holdings' last reported first-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings per share (EPS) reflected a massive 46.4% year-over-year deterioration. Revenues in the quarter dropped 3.6% year over year. The dismal performance was primarily due to lower sales at the U.S. & Canada international and manufacturing/wholesale segments. Also, in the first quarter of 2017, gross margin and adjusted operating margin deteriorated. Hence, we expect a similar trend in the second quarter of 2017 as well.GNC Holdings, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise GNC Holdings, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | GNC Holdings, Inc. QuoteMoreover, GNC Holdings has a number of tough competitors in the market that include large international pharmacy chains, major international supermarket firms and large U.S.-based companies with global operations. Thus, we expect the company to slash product prices in the face of stiff competition, which, in turn, may hurt margins.Also, currency headwinds continue to be a growing concern for GNC Holdings. Management also expects the failure to comply with FTC regulations and changing consumer preferences to hamper business.However, on the bright side, the performance of One New GNC was quite encouraging during the first quarter of 2017. Banking on it, we expect the company to continue to gain in the yet-to-be-reported quarter. Meanwhile, the launch of the PRO Access program has added members to the company’s customer base, which is expected to drive growth.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for GNC Holdings this quarter.

Last quarter marked another milestone for the company wherein China emerged the second largest market globally with the United States leading the bandwagon.The company has also witnessed balanced sales growth across all its channels in the recent past, primarily driven by high InvisAlign Technology case volumes. A solid performance in the summer too drove Invisalign growth in the global teen market.Another positive aspect is that the company has recently signed a distribution agreement with Patterson Dental. Per this non-exclusive deal, effective from September onward, Align Technology’s iTero Element intraoral scanning system will be available as part of Patterson Dental’s CAD/CAM portfolio in the United States and Canada. On the flip side, an adverse foreign exchange translation continues to raise concerns for Align Technology’s international operations.

755,ALGN,"Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. (ZBH  -  Free Report) recently announced positive results from PROGRESS II for treatment of knee osteoarthritis (OA). Data from the study (based on 46 patients with symptomatic knee OA pain from the four trial sites across Europe) demonstrated the safety and efficacy of the nSTRIDE Autologous Protein Solution (APS) Kit for the therapy.Per the company, investigators prepared APS by using Zimmer Biomet's nSTRIDE APS Kit, which concentrates anti-inflammatory cytokines and growth factors from a sample of the enrolled patient's blood for delivery via a single intra-articular injection into the knee joint. The outcome showed a significant improvement in the percentage change from baseline in pain scores along with comparable safety to saline.Notably, nSTRIDE APS Kit is marketed in Europe, Japan and Asia-Pacific as well. However, the kit is commercially unavailable in the United States. It is under clinical evaluation in the country. Furthermore, positive findings confirm the basis for two more trials namely, PROGRESS IV and PROGRESS V. Developments in Knee BusinessLast quarter, revenues derived from Knees were down 1.7% year over year. However, the company is putting in consistent efforts to improve its knee business. In this regard, we note that Zimmer Biomet announced the global launch of the Persona Partial Knee System on Aug 31, an advanced addition to the company’s portfolio of personalized and anatomically designed knee implant systems.Another major development in Zimmer Biomet’s Knees business is the unveiling of an X-ray-based Patient Specific Instrument known as X-PSI Knee System in June.

757,ALGN,"On Dec 22, we issued an updated research report on Haemonetics Corporation (HAE  -  Free Report). The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).This leading provider of hematology products and solutions has been trading above the broader industry year to date. The stock has rallied 45.4% compared with the broader industry’s 23.6% gain. The stock has also outperformed the S&P 500’s 20.3% gain. We remained encouraged by the strength in Haemonetics’ Hospital business, where Hemostasis Management has been witnessing strong growth over the past few quarters.Interestingly, fiscal 2017 growth was evenly split between the TEG 5000 and the TEG 6s, with solid performance in the United States, UK and China.  Per management, TEG has become the global leader in Hemostasis Management. The TEG 5000 is approved for a broad set of indication in all of its top markets. The TEG 6s and TEG Manager are approved for the same set of indications in Europe, Australia and Japan. In the United States, TEG 6s is indicated for cardiovascular surgery and the company is currently planning to get an approval for a broader set of indications beginning with trauma.For fiscal 2018, Haemonetics expects the Hospital business to grow majorly on the back of strength in Transfusion Management.We are also upbeat about Haemonetics’ growth in Plasma franchise. Strong end-market demand for plasma-derived biopharmaceuticals continue to drive the company’s growth. Haemonetics is confident about maintaining growth in the commercial Plasma collection business. The company is also optimistic about strong market adoption of its NexSys PCS plasmapheresis system which recently received the FDA approval.Further, the raised fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings guidance is also encouraging. Meanwhile, the company’s strong cash position boosts investors’ confidence.On the flip side, Haemonetics operates in a very competitive environment, both for manual and automated systems, which includes companies like MAK Systems and many others.Moreover, the company has been witnessing sluggish revenue growth at the Blood Center franchise, significantly affecting its results over the past few quarters. Management also doesn’t expect any early recovery in the Blood Center’s outcomes, which adds to our concerns.Key PicksA few better-ranked medical stocks are Bruker Corporation (BRKR  -  Free Report), Align Technology, Inc. (ALGN  -  Free Report) and Chemed Corporation (CHE  -  Free Report). While Bruker and Align Technology sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Chemed carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

758,ALGN,"On Dec 21, we issued an updated research report on Abbott (ABT), a global healthcare company dedicated toward improving life through development of products and technologies. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Over the last three months, Abbott has been trading above the broader industry. The stock has gained 8.4% compared with the industry's growth of 2.9%.Overall, the company stands to benefit from the ongoing integration and synergy achievement of St. Jude. Meanwhile, after an enduring legal battle, the company’s recent completion of Alere acquisition is another upside. With the successful wrap up of this transaction, the combined company anticipates to emerge a lead player in the $7 billion point-of-care diagnostic space.We are also looking forward to Abbott’s plans to focus on marketing its product portfolio in core therapeutic areas. Recently, Abbott's FreeStyle Libre Flash received an FDA approval. Also, the company has received approval from the regulatory body for magnetic resonance-conditional labeling for its Ellipse implantable cardioverter defibrillator recently. Overall, we are encouraged by Abbott’s yet another quarter of better-than-expected earnings and revenue performance.Apart from the FDA approvals and buyouts, we are upbeat about Abbott’s FreeStyle Libre Flash Glucose Monitoring System prospects post the receipt of full or partial reimbursement by the French Health Ministry in May. On this platform, the company announced the Health Canada License for FreeStyle Libre in June. It also informed that the FreeStyle Libre system is now available for reimbursement in the U.K.On the flip side, Abbott’s sluggish pediatric business in China continues to mar growth. Also, management is concerned about the economic problems in Venezuela, expected to remain unresolved for some time. Plus, foreign exchange is a major headwind for the company as a considerable portion of its revenues comes from outside the United States.Key PicksA few better-ranked medical stocks are athenahealth, Inc.

The company has gained 8.4% over the last six months, much higher than the broader industry’s gain of 2.4% with respect to share price. The stock has a market cap of $16.59 billion.Taking the stable stock performance into consideration, we expect LabCorp to scale higher in the coming quarters.

760,ALGN,"On Dec 19, we issued an updated research report on AmerisourceBergen Corporation (ABC  -  Free Report), one of the world’s largest pharmaceutical service companies. The company focuses on providing drug distribution and related services to reduce health care costs and improve patient outcome.We are positive on the deals signed by AmerisourceBergen, which should boost its top line. The company entered into a strategic agreement with Walgreen Boots Alliance (WBA  -  Free Report). The agreement includes a 10-year pharmaceutical distribution contract with Walgreens Boot Alliance, under which the company will distribute branded and generic pharmaceutical products to Walgreen Boots.We believe that AmerisourceBergen will benefit from generics growth in the long run. The company is well-positioned to help products get to market efficiently.AmerisourceBergen has been actively pursuing acquisitions to strengthen its core areas. The MWI Veterinary acquisition has diversified the company’s existing pharmaceutical distribution & services businesses into the highly lucrative animal health market.  On the flip side, cutthroat competition in the niche space is a concern. AmerisourceBergen operates in a highly competitive pharmaceutical distribution and related health care services market. The company’s primary competitors are national generic and regional distributors. The generic industry is witnessing consolidation of customers and manufacturers, globalization and increasing quality along with regulatory challenges. The company also faces competition from manufacturers, chain drugstores, specialty distributors and packaging and health care technology companies.In the last six months, AmerisourceBergen has been trading below the industry in terms of price. Shares of the company have lost 2.7% compared with the industry’s rally of 2.4%.Zacks Rank & Key PicksAmerisourceBergen carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked medical stocks are athenahealth, Inc.

This represents a strong year-to-date return of approximately 48.4%, higher than the S&P 500’s 20.2%.

The company also has a trailing four-quarter average positive earnings surprise of 4.5%.

The stock has rallied 8.6% over the last three months, beating the industry’s gain of just 3.3%.  Factors Driving the StockAlere Acquisition: Abbott’s successful closure of the Alere acquisition after a prolonged legal battle has instilled confidence in investors. The acquisition closed in October 2017 under amended financial terms in favor of Abbott. Taking the attractive prospects of Point-of-care testing within the in vitro diagnostics market into consideration, Abbott is highly optimistic about the Alere integration. According to the company, the Alere buyout will significantly expand its diagnostics presence.

Recently, its FreeStyle Libre Flash received FDA approval. Also, it received approval for MR-conditional labeling for Ellipse ICD.Developing Diabetes Business: There have been a slew of developments within the Diabetics business. We are upbeat about Abbott’s FreeStyle Libre Flash Glucose Monitoring System’s recent reimbursement approval in the U.K. Plus, the company recently announced receipt of Health Canada License for the same. In May 2017, the company received full or partial reimbursement from the French Health Ministry for the product.Solid Emerging Market Performance: Abbott’s emerging market performance has been promising, courtesy of the latest strategic developments.

762,ALGN,"“America has the best doctors, the best nurses, the best hospitals, the best medical technology, the best medical breakthrough medicines in the world.” – Rep. Bill FristIn terms of market size, the U.S. health care market is the largest in the world. A report by Health Access suggests that America’s unparalleled purchasing power, massive demand for medical services and equipment, and opportunity for innovation has lent it a competitive edge.Further, the markets got a boost after President Donald Trump — an ardent proponent of “living big, living large” — came into power. His constant efforts to boost American lifestyle, focus on middle class and incorporate the best health care in America have been creating a stir.Trump’s efforts to eliminate the country’s jobless stature are remarkable. Per reports, the U.S. unemployment rate was pegged at 4.1% in November, the lowest since February 2001. Undoubtedly, Trump’s “America first!” pitch has been driving employment growth like never before.Four Factors to Drive MedTech in 2018Increasing Consolidation in HealthcareThe latest trend of increasing consolidation in the healthcare space has led to a reduction in the number of players, greater market concentration and reduced competition as well as increasing barriers of entry in the industry. The companies will benefit from higher market cap, which will put them in a position to negotiate with suppliers and consumers.The recent $69-billion deal between Aetna Inc. (AET  -  Free Report) and CVS Health (CVS  -  Free Report) is a significant example. It qualifies as vertical integration, which will enable the newly formed entity to sell a range of services and products from drug to insurance cover.President Trump’s Focus on Emerging MarketsPer a recent BCG report, the share of emerging market revenues, which is less than a quarter of MedTech’s global revenues, is likely to increase to nearly one-third by 2022.Thus, the United States' trade plans with emerging countries are likely to favor the domestic companies.In this regard, investors may find President Trump’s 12-day Asia trip last month interesting. The visit was aimed at boosting inter-country trade relations, particularly with the emerging nations. Trump’s promise to augment bilateral trade agreements with Indo-Pacific nations instills our confidence in his APAC policies. He also emphasized “free and open Indo-Pacific trade” with a focus on the nations of Japan, Australia and India.IVD & PBM Markets to Thrive A research report by EvaluateMedTech World Preview indicates that global MedTech sales are expected to witness a CAGR of 5.1% to $522 billion by 2022, with IVD (in Vitro diagnosis) raking in annual sales of $69.6 billion at a CAGR of 5.9%. Increasing investments from government and private players in the form of reimbursement coverage and speedy patent approvals are driving demand.The role of pharmacy benefit managers (PBM) in the U.S. healthcare sector has been evolving. PBMs manage pharmaceutical spending and enhance health benefits for end users. Per a report by Market Research Reports.biz, the global PBM market will see a CAGR of 7.16% between 2014 and 2019. Investing in PBM stocks can be a prudent move for registering solid gains in 2018. Looking for the Best Stocks for 2018? Be among the first to see our Top Ten Stocks for 2018 portfolio here.Robot-based Applications to Boost MedTechThe AI-based applications have been enhancing the healthcare space with clinical applications, diagnostic support, operational efficiency, Electronic Health Record systems, practice workflows and supply chain management. The growing prevalence of minimally-invasive robot-assisted surgeries, self-automated home-based care, use of IT for quick and improved patient care and shift of the payment system to a value-based model.For example, MedTech major Intuitive Surgical designs, manufactures and markets the da Vinci surgical system — an advanced robot-assisted surgical platform. This AI platform enables minimally-invasive surgery that helps avoid the trauma associated with open surgery. The company plans to expand the usage of da Vinci in general and thoracic surgery, colorectal surgery and hernia repair in the days to come.Picking the Right StocksBased on certain parameters, we have selected six MedTech growth stocks which are poised for impressive returns in 2017.

763,ALGN,"PerkinElmer, Inc. (PKI  -  Free Report) recently announced the completion of the buyout of EUROIMMUN Medical Laboratory Diagnostics AG for approximately $1.3 billion in cash. The latter is an autoimmune testing company and an emerging player in infectious disease and allergy testing.We feel the acquisition is a strategic move by PerkinElmer. Lubeck, Germany-based EUROIMMUN has approximately 9,500 employees serving customers in more than 150 countries.Financial ImpactThe acquisition of EUROIMMUN Medical Laboratory Diagnostics should expand PerkinElmer’s reach into autoimmune and allergy diagnostic markets. The buyout will also enhance PerkinElmer’s capabilities in China’s new infectious disease market. Per management, the acquisition is expected to add about 28 cents to 30 cents per share to 2018 adjusted earnings.Management expects the addition of EUROIMMUN to drive R&D expense margin.The company is consistently trying to drive inorganic growth through acquisitions. The company recently completed the buyout of Tulip Diagnostics Private Limited, a company based in Goa, India, for a total consideration of $127.3 million.  Diagnostic Segment Gets a BoostPerkinElmer will now have advanced detection capabilities, and imaging and assay development prospects to deliver better and more complete solutions to customers.In fact, post acquisition, PerkinElmer's complete global diagnostics portfolio will get a boost.

We believe the latest development will further boost growth at the segment.Stock PerformanceThe price performance of PerkinElmer has been favorable in the last year. The stock has gained 8.3%, outperforming the broader industry’s gain of almost 6.8%. The current level compares favorably with the S&P 500’s return of 8%.Zacks Rank & Key PicksPerkinElmer carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked medical stocks are athenahealth, Inc.

764,ALGN,"On Dec 19, we issued an updated research report on DexCom, Inc. (DXCM  -  Free Report). The company has been trading above the broader industry over the past month. The stock has gained 5.5%, higher than the broader industry’s gain of 0.8%.We believe the glucose monitoring market represents significant opportunity for DexCom. The diabetes market is large and growing. In the third quarter of 2017, management at Dexcom confirmed that the company is well poised to meet the unmet demand in the global diabetic space, especially when it comes to the continuous glucose monitoring facility.DexCom has collaborative agreements with several companies, which should not only bring in cash in the form of milestone payments and royalties but should also help expand its product portfolio. In this regard, DexCom announced its collaboration in September 2017 with leading wearables brand Fitbit to develop and market products for better management of diabetes and get a clearer picture of overall health with easy-to-use mobile tools.  DexCom continues to focus on international markets, especially Germany. The company is also eyeing the sizeable markets of India, China and Japan. Given the demographic trends and lifestyle in countries outside the United States and Europe, we believe that DexCom has bountiful opportunities in the international market.However, the company faces reimbursement risks owing to efforts to control healthcare expenses. Further, with an increasing demand for its offerings, DexCom might face supply constraints in the near term.The market for blood glucose monitoring devices is highly competitive, subject to rapid change and significantly affected by product launches. With respect to the G4 Platinum system, DexCom competes directly with Roche Diabetes Care — a division of Roche Diagnostics; LifeScan, Inc. — a division of Johnson & Johnson; the MediSense and TheraSense divisions of Abbott Laboratories; and Bayer Corporation.Zacks Rank & Key PicksDexCom carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked medical stocks are athenahealth, Inc.

The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).This leading medical device company has been trading above the broader industry over the past three months. The stock has gained 10.8% in comparison to the broader industry’s 3%.We are upbeat about NuVasive’s solid top-line gains from the international business. In the third quarter of 2017, the company’s international business exceeded its expectations by recording 46% growth at CER on continued strong demand for the company’s spine technology, particularly in the key markets of Italy, Germany and Japan. Overall, the company believes that its share in the international market will rise to double-digits over the next several years. Banking on the stellar first-half 2017 performance, the company raised its international business growth guidance to more than 20% for 2017.  NuVasive recently adopted a few strategies to drive adjusted operating margin to 25% after reaching the $1.0 billion-revenue mark in 2017. This includes plans to well-align strategy, technology and marketing in order to enhance product development and commercialization capability. Also, NuVasive plans to merge its U.S. Commercial and International sales functions into global commercial organization. This apart, the company intends to alter its global operations to enhance efficiencies through the combination of manufacturing, supply chain, information technology (IT), regulatory affairs and quality assurance (RA/QA).We are also encouraged by the company’s receipt of certain FDA approvals of late. In October, NuVasive received an expanded 510(k) clearance from the FDA for its TLX interbody system. Notably, TLX has been designed for a minimally-invasive spine surgery approach. In the same month, the company announced another expanded FDA 510(k) approval for its advanced magnetic and non-invasive limb lengthening technology — PRECICE. NuVasive also received FDA approval to use the redesigned MAGEC system with its RELINE Small Stature system in September.On the flip side, pricing continues to remain a major headwind as NuVasive has been facing declining product prices due to intensifying competition in the spine market and pricing pressure experienced by hospital customers from managed care organizations, insurance providers and other third-party payers. Further, the continuous contraction in gross margin is a matter of concern.Key PicksA few better-ranked medical stocks are athenahealth, Inc. (ATHN  -  Free Report), Align Technology, Inc.

766,ALGN,"On Dec 18, we issued an updated research report on Genomic Health Inc (GHDX  -  Free Report), a global cancer research company with its focus on advanced molecular diagnostics.Genomic Health has been trading above the broader industryover the past three months. The stock has rallied 16.2% compared with the broader industry’s 11.4% decline. In fact the stock has skyrocketed over the past week on a couple of developments.The market is particularly optimistic about Genomic Health’s recently announced outcomes from a series of 10 trials, which underscore the efficiency of the Oncotype DX Breast Recurrence Score test and the Oncotype DX DCIS Score test for breast cancer. Notably, Ductal carcinoma in situ, also known as DCIS, is the most common type of non-invasive breast cancer.We are also upbeat about the company’s multi-year research collaboration agreement with Janssen Pharmaceuticals to evaluate the Oncotype DX Genomic Prostate Score (“GPS”) test for its prostate cancer drug pipeline.  As part of the deal, Genomic Health will test samples from Janssen studies to examine the association of GPS results with clinical outcomes.Overall, we are encouraged by the year-over-year rise in revenues, driven by solid performances in the United States and internationally. During the third quarter, international test volumes expanded 14%, representing 26% of the total test volumes in the period.So far, Genomic Health has witnessed a healthy progress with regard to establishing coverage for its Oncotype DX breast cancer test. In 2018, Genomic Health expects several key catalysts to drive strong revenue growth. These catalysts include the anticipated implementation of both PAMA (Protecting Access to Medicare Act) reimbursement — at a higher level than the 2016 invasive breast rate — and AJCC (American Joint Committee on Cancer) staging criteria, which will be effective from January 2018.Within the prostate cancer business, the Oncotype DX Genomic Prostate Score test received a positive Local Coverage Determination to expand Medicare coverage by Palmetto GBA. The company also made some positive developments for its Oncotype DX Breast Recurrence Score tests. In addition, it established a private coverage for the test in Germany.On the flip side, revenues in the third quarter of 2017 lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate due to disruption from the hurricanes in certain regions of the United States (estimated to have affected domestic test volumes by approximately 3%). The company’s rising operating losses also continue to be a huge concern. In addition, its sole reliance on profitability of Breast Oncotype DX test is a challenge to cope with. Above all, management’s decision not to issue any guidance has been discouraging too as it failed to provide us with any definite visibility about the company’s upcoming performance.Zacks Rank & Key PicksGenomic Health has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

768,ALGN,"Higher hopes of the tax reform of being passed have acted as the latest catalyst in driving the Wall Street to new highs.

769,ALGN,"Henry Schein, Inc. (HSIC  -  Free Report) recently completed the buyout of eVetPractice — a provider of cloud-based practice management solutions to veterinary clinics. Although the financial terms of the deal have been kept under wraps, the company expects the deal to prove accretive to its earnings per share post 2018.Per the company, the eVetPractice will be a part of Henry Schein’s Veterinary Solutions portfolio which comprises AVImark and ImproMed in North America, as well as Vision, RxWorks and RoboVet globally. Notably, eVetPractice is a rapidly growing cloud solutions provider in the United States, with a customer base of around 900. We believe the latest takeover will widen Henry Schein’s customer base and portfolio.Developments in Technology & VASIn September, Henry Schein had announced the receipt of Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC-Health IT) 2015 Edition Health IT Module Certification from Drummond Group LLC for its practice management and electronic health record software — MicroMD.The company offers a wide range of practice management software systems covering dental, animal health and medical. It has a customer base of more than 95,000 practices, inclusive of MicroMD for physician practices.Continuing with the slew of developments, the company had earlier announced a partnership between Medical Systems and Simplifeye. The combined entity aimed at creating a mobile experience by integration of Simplifeye with Henry Schein’s MicroMD. Furthermore, this collaboration aims at allowing physicians to provide more customized patient experiences, simplify their practice workflows and keep concerned team members well connected when away from their workplaces.Performance of Technology and VASWe believe this latest development will boost sales in the company’s global Technology and Value-added Services (VAS) business. Interestingly, this segment saw a 4.1% increase in revenues in the last reported quarter. This included 3.7% growth in local currencies and a 0.4% rise related to foreign currency exchange. Acquisitions contributed 0.7% in the quarter under review.Market PotentialAccording to a report by MarketsandMarkets, the global veterinary software market is expected to reach a value of $368.7 million by 2019, at a CAGR of 5.6% during 2014 to 2019. Considering the substantial potential of the market, we believe the latest development is a strategic one.Per the company, the increasing trend toward cost control has the potential to drive the demand for technology solutions. Going by another report from MarketsandMarkets, the global healthcare IT market is projected to reach a value of $280.25 billion at a CAGR of 15.9% in the 2016-2021 period.We believe an ageing population, unhealthy lifestyle along with rising awareness and expenditure in healthcare will continue to drive growth in the healthcare IT market.

770,ALGN,"On Sep 12, we issued an updated research report on Amedisys, Inc. (AMED  -  Free Report). The stock carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).This renowned home health and hospice services provider has been trading above the broader industry over the past three months. The stock has gained 1.7% as against the broader industry’s 0.4% decline.Amedisys’ Personal Care segment has been stabilizing on the integration of the latest tuck-in acquisitions. Moreover, the company is upbeat about the bountiful prospects in this segment. With the recently-announced Intercity takeover, the company has closed a total of three personal care acquisitions since last September and is awaiting regulatory approval for the buyout of East Tennessee Personal Care Services.  Amedisys also plans to evolve from a traditional home health and hospice care company to one that is focused on bringing home a continuum of care. This is because the company intends to better serve patients and diversify sources of payment to lower dependence on Medicare. In this regard, the company saw a rise in non-Medicare revenues, while Medicare revenues declined at the Home Health division in the third quarter. At the Hospice division, the company recorded strong growth across all segments.Also, a favorable 2018 Home Health Final Rule buoys optimism. According to a report by HEALTHCAREfirst, the 2018 Home Health Final Rule was finalized without the implementation of the Home Health Groupings Model (HHGM) scheduled for rollout in 2019.Meanwhile, Amedisys is poised to benefit from the aging demographics of the U.S. population and the need for higher acuity patients in a home nursing environment. Furthermore, the company’s strong cash balance position bolsters investors’ confidence in the stock.On the flip side, escalating operating expenses and declining gross margin continue raise concerns. Also, an intensely competitive landscape and regulatory concerns weigh on the home health and hospice industry.Other Key PicksOther top-ranked medical stocks are athenahealth, Inc.

This buyout will provide Express Scripts opportunities to cross-sell to both the client bases.Furthermore, this buyout widens Express Scripts' ability to drive value in the use of Specialty medications. Notably, specialty medications are used to treat complex and chronic conditions.

So, the latest development is strategic fit keeping the bountiful opportunities in this niche space in mind.Financial ImpactThe acquisition is expected to prove accretive to Express Scripts’ adjusted diluted earnings per share in 2018, excluding transaction-related expenses and amortization of intangibles.Guidance RaisedExpress Scripts increased its previously issued consolidated 2017 full-year adjusted EPS guidance range of $6.97 to $7.05 to $7.00 to $7.08, reflecting a growth of 10% over consolidated 2016 adjusted EPS results at the midpoint of the range.The company has also provided adjusted earnings per diluted share guidance for 2018 in the range of $7.67 to $7.87, reflecting growth of 9% to 12% from the midpoint of the updated 2017 adjusted EPS guidance range.Share Price & Estimate Revision TrendExpress Scripts’ stock has outperformed the broader industry in the last six months.

772,ALGN,"The phenomenal growth story that is Align Technology (ALGN  -  Free Report), makers of the revolutionary Invisalign clear teeth straighteners, continues to make early investors smile while apparently catching the majority by surprise.  In the past year, ALGN shares are up 155% vs the S&P 500 at +14%. That performance certainly made members of my Healthcare Innovators portfolio smile big where we owned the stock from $133 up to $333. Now trading above $360, with an all-time high close of $370.10 hit on June 18, ALGN shares trade for over 75 times the consensus EPS estimate for this year of $4.73. And that explains why so many passed on boarding this one-way train to big gains. What the majority missed was that the company's breakthrough dental technologies were going to maintain over 25% growth domestically and nearly 35% growth internationally as more dental professionals found the Invisalign system to be an extremely effective and highly desirable solution for their patients. The Align Trajectory Here's what I told my followers on May 28, a few days before we took some profits on our position... One of our biggest success stories with Healthcare Innovators keeps on rolling based on the same catalysts that have kept us in the name every quarter since May of last year: wider adoption of the Invisalign technology by US consumers and dental professionals, low competitive threat, and 30%+ international growth. The company held an Investor/Analyst Day on Wednesday (May 23) and wowed the crowd. Plus, competing products at this month's American Association of Orthodontists tradeshow were seen as limited in the type of malocclusions that can be treated, and many also lack supporting case management software for the orthodontist that is critical to the overall process in today's market. The company provided long-term revenue guidance of 20%-30% growth, above expectations and the previous long-term guidance of 15%-25%. Key growth drivers remain in place from a geographic and product perspective and Align remains one of the most compelling growth stories in all of medical technology. Here was a slide from the company presentation I posted on Twitter that captured the essence of the growth trajectory...  What got cut off on the bottom is the labels for the quarters. They are Q1'17, Q4'17, and Q1'18 so that you can see year-over-year and sequential growth as indicated by the brackets (in thousands of units shipped).  And the top row of numbers in green circles (5.2, 5.4, 5.4) are the Utilization rates, calculated by # of cases shipped / # of doctors to whom cases were shipped. This measure indicates the trajectory of dental professional adoption vs. just new physicians trying the product once or twice.   Now let's hear from some of the analysts who helped pop the stock above $310 on May 24... Leerink Swann analyst Richard Newitter raised his price target for Align Technology from $305 to $360 saying he came away from the company's Analyst Day with increased confidence in the sustainability of its market-leading position in a still significantly underpenetrated clear aligner/orthodontic market opportunity.  Jefferies analyst Brandon Couillard raised his price target for Align Technology from $300 to $350 saying he left Wednesday's company presentation more confident in the durability of the company's competitive advantages. Align stands to benefit from the analog to digital shift underway in ortho dentistry. And Stifel Nicolaus analyst Jonathan Block went ahead of the pack earlier in the week and raised his price target on ALGN from $320 to $350. He noted that ALGN shares had rallied since the AAO meeting and he believed additional upside existed, as investors would get more comfortable with Align's future growth, despite increasing competition, after the company updates at the Investor/Analyst Day. Boy, Block nailed that call! So why did I sell in the low $330s for nearly 150% gains -- and do I regret it? First off, I sold because I thought the stock had moved really quickly to fulfill the best of expectations -- from $250 to $333, or over 33%, just in May! So it was quickly back to trading over 70X EPS even with the new and improved growth guidance. And I thought it might ""back-and-fill"" for a little while between $310 and $340. Boy, Cooker dropped that ball! Do I regret it? Only a little. What I mean is that I achieved the bulk of the mission by caputuring the meat of the move. And we also booked a long-term gain in the Healthcare Innovators portfolio whereas we just traded it short-term in my TAZR portfolio and grabbed 57%. But there is a wider lesson here about how bull markets work and why following long-term investors in great businesses in their early growth stages -- for 2-5 years to let the growth fully materialize -- really pays off. You can learn more about those ideas in this article I wrote recently... A Wonder to Behold: Last Innings of the Bull Market Kevin Cook is a Senior Stock Strategist for Zacks Investment Research where he runs the TAZR Trader and Healthcare Innovators services.

774,ALGN,"The Medical Instrument industry within the broader Medical universe has been gaining on R&D innovation, higher consolidation, focus on emerging market and tax abolition. The industry increased 3.6% in a month’s time, higher than the S&P 500 index’s rise of 2%.Fundamentally, the industry has benefited by a massive change in consumer behavior as well.

But first, let us glance at the latest headlines from the space. Latest Medical Instrument Headlines at a Glance Stryker’s Takeover Plans of Boston ScientificThe Medical Instrument fraternity has been riding on the current merger and acquisition (M&A) trends.Per a recent report by the Reuters, Stryker Corporation (SYK  -  Free Report) is likely to take over Boston Scientific Corporation (BSX  -  Free Report), creating a market value of more than $110 billion. However, the possibility of the deal is uncertain. Thre are no confirmatory statements or press releases from the company representatives.In fact, investors should never forget about Stryker’s highly-rumored acquisition plans of Smith & Nephew in 2015, which never materialized. On the brighter side, this is not the first time Stryker has been tied up with Boston Scientific. The company acquired Boston Scientific's neurovascular unit in 2010 for $1.5 billion, which indicates probability of a second collaboration (read more: Stryker Likely to Acquire Boston Scientific).Stryker has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).If the deal materializes, the combined entity will have one of the MedTech’s broadest spectrums of product offerings that include cardiology, orthopaedics, surgical supplies and neuroscience. This will reduce pricing pressure and competition. Further, the companies with a strong acquisition policy will gain from rapidly-expanding customer base, moderate leverage and enhanced cash flow.Glancing at major acquisitions in the recent past, Becton, Dickinson and Company’s takeover of C. R. Bard for $24 billion and JOHNSON & JOHNSON’s buyout of Covidien for about $43 billion deserve a mention.Abiomed Reserves Slot in the S&P 500 Leading Medical Instrument player Abiomed Inc (ABMD  -  Free Report) replaced Wyndham Worldwide Corp and entered the S&P 500 Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) Health Care Supplies Sub-Industry index.Per a research report by The Globe and Mail, Abiomed is following the trend of medical device and technology companies reserving the top slot in the S&P 500 index. To remind investors, Align Technology Inc (ALGN  -  Free Report) topped the index in 2017.Abiomed currently has a market capitalization of $18.6 billion. Further, the company’s financial viability, adequate liquidity, reasonable price and sector representation has lent it a competitive edge in the U.S. Medical Instrument industry (read more: Abiomed to Replace Wyndham in the S&P 500 Benchmark).Tax Abolition Boosting R&DA bipartisan two-year suspension of a ‘Medical Device’ tax, which imposed a 2.3% excise tax on MedTech manufacturers, has been a temporary relief. This tax took a toll on the entire medical device industry since its enactment. Per the Advanced Medical Technology Association lobbying group, this tax had a negative impact on medical innovation resulting in loss or deferred creation of jobs.For now, the deferral will encourage R&D activities in this space. The repeal of the tax paradigm is expected to boost hiring and investment among the 9,000 America-based medical device manufacturers, instilling investor’s optimism. The ratification of the Tax-repeal amendment has invoked massive investment in the sector.3 Top Medical Instrument StocksConsidering the existence of the number of players in the Medical Instruments industry, choosing the right stocks with the potential to yield returns might be a daunting task.Our proprietary Zacks methodology makes it fairly simple for you.We have taken the help of the Zacks Stock Screener to select favorable stocks.

775,ALGN,"A company’s ability to provide good returns to its investors even after meeting all its business-related costs and expenses can be measured using profitability analysis. A fundamentally strong company generally has a high level of profitability. In this respect, we have used an accounting ratio to evaluate the profitability position of a company and identify a profitable company over a loss-making one.The best accounting tool to understand a company’s profitability position is ratio analysis. Generally, there are four key profitability ratios — gross income ratio, operating income ratio, pre-tax profit margin and net income ratio. Here, we have used the most effective and frequently used profitability ratio — net income ratio.Net Income RatioNet income ratio gives us the exact profit level of a company. It reflects the percentage of net income to total sales revenues. Using net income ratio, one can determine a company’s capability to meet operating and non-operating expenses with its sales revenues. A higher net income ratio usually implies a company’s ability to generate ample sales revenues and successfully manage all business functions.Screening ParametersNet income ratio is not the only indicator of future winners. So, we have added a few more criteria to arrive at a winning strategy.Zacks Rank equal to #1: Only Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks are allowed.

777,ALGN,"Welcome back to Mind Over Money. I'm Kevin Cook, your field guide and story teller for the fascinating arena of behavioral economics.Today I want to tell you about a special video I made for my subscribers at Zacks.com. I titled it The 3 Rules of a Bull Market because, at the risk of over-simplifying, I wanted to crystallize my favorite principles, earned over 25 years of experience in good markets and bad, into lessons for all future bull markets.My hope is that this video becomes a teaching tool for investors age 8 to 88 because its lessons will certainly stand the test of time in the next bull market, and the one after that too.I also took half of this podcast to do a quasi review of a new book titled How Emotions Are Made: The Secret Life of the Brain by neuroscientist Lisa Feldman Barrett. More on that coming up.When I talk to investors about the stock market this year, I still hear all the reasons that it's time to be cautious and the end is near.But all my experience tells me differently. And while I have often thought this year that the market must be in its 6th or 7th inning, I have few fundamental reasons to believe that it couldn't keep making new highs for another two to three years.So as I look back at the portfolios and the body of content I've created over the years to help investors profit, I wondered if I could simplify the message even further.I often prefer not to over-simplify, leaning instead toward parsing out the complexities and nuances of economic matters.But my work does have the same persistent themes. And so I realized, I could very easily crystallize them into 3 rules, and just ten words total.In the video that accompanies this article, I go back over some of those messages from the past nine years of this bull market.Then I summarize them all with my ""3 Rules.""In the video, I also promise some useful links...For a review of my latest fundamental update on BABA in case you missed it, here was my May ZU Strategy Session presentation. It's the last clip at minute 44:20...May ZUSS: Top Stock Pick BABA at 44:20Even then after awesome earnings and growth guidance, I reminded investors ""If you can get in under $200, do it!""The Moral of the Bull's StoryGot a minute?I can think of no better way to quickly sum up the moral of this story than with a 1-minute video I recorded last year over at the CBOE. TV host Angela Miles asked me for my favorite ""trader's tip"" and I knew instantly that if I only had a minute to share with thousands of investors, I would choose this one core idea...Follow the Smart MoneyFinally, here was the message I offered on Tracey Ryniec's MarketEdge podcast back in January...Cooker’s Melt-Up RecipeThree ingredients for a ""melt-up recipe"" that investors can profit from.1. Multiple Expansion Is Under Control: We may be in the 6th inning of this bull market, but multiple expansion isn’t yet as high as it was at the peak of other bull rallies like 1999-2000. There could still be plenty more upside to go.2. Competition: There’s less stock and more investors. Additionally, Wall Street, unlike most retail investors, has to buy, but doesn’t have to sell.3. No global macro worries: Whatever happened to the Eurozone crisis or China having a hard landing? For the first time in a decade, the global economy is in sync and growing at the same time with virtually no economic crises looming.(end of excerpt from MarketEdge podcast)Granted, the market headed into a 10% correction right after that on new global-macro worries about a trade war. But I also warned Zacks Ultimate members about the temporary ""exuberance"" in stocks 2 weeks prior.So trade-war anxiety was a good, albeit surprising, antidote to wring out some excess bullishness. It's all part of the short-term swings of extreme optimism and pessimism in markets and very healthy overall.And despite my long-term bullishness, I'm always ready with ""dry powder"" for a pullback to buy more of my favorite stocks.The Chemistry and Culture of EmotionSince I began the Mind Over Money podcast in November of 2016, I have frequently read from books by two different groups of scientists that form the foundation of my knowledge about human psychology in markets and beyond.The first group is, of course, the behavioral theorists like Daniel Kahneman, Richard Thaler, and Dan Ariely who have helped create the field of behavioral economics, and its smaller niches in finance and trading.The second group is composed of the neuroscientists like Antonio Damasio, John Ratey, and Candace Pert (discoverer of the opiate receptor) who have taught me much about the latest discoveries in the structure and function of our incredibly complex brains.I just started reading the new book by Lisa Feldman Barrett, PhD, this week and I offer some initial reactions on the podcast. Dr. Barrett is a University Distinguished Professor of Psychology at Northeastern University, with appointments at Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital.In addition to the book How Emotions are Made: The Secret Life of the Brain, Dr. Barrett has published over 200 peer-reviewed, scientific papers appearing in Science, Nature Neuroscience, and other top journals in psychology and cognitive neuroscience, as well as six academic volumes published by Guilford Press. She has also given a popular TED talk.Dr. Barrett received a National Institutes of Health Director’s Pioneer Award for her revolutionary research on emotion in the brain. These highly competitive, multimillion dollar awards are given to scientists of exceptional creativity who are expected to transform biomedical and behavioral research.Despite my natural attraction and openness to any book about the brain, I actually had some initial reactions of resistance and confusion when I first started reading the introduction. Dr. Barrett's ""point of attack"" seemed to be on the cultural and even scientific misconceptions about how emotions are created.After reading nearly two dozen books by other neuroscientists, I guess I assumed that much of the confusion had already been cleared up. But at 320 pages, with a 45-page bibliography and 40+ pages of notes, the book appears to offer several months of instruction and insight.And so I am more than willing to give the expert the benefit of the doubt as I dive in this summer.Be sure to check out the full podcast to hear me read a few paragraphs from the book and offer my amateur observations, whatever those are worth.And don't forget to watch my video The 3 Rules of a Bull Market and to share it with friends and fellow investors you know, be they anywhere from 8 to 88!Disclosure: I own shares of NVDA, LRCX, and BABA for the Zacks TAZR Trader portfolio.Kevin Cook is a Senior Stock Strategist for Zacks Investment Research where he runs the TAZR Trader and Healthcare Innovators services.

779,ALGN,"The respiratory division of Teleflex Incorporated (TFX  -  Free Report) has recently entered into a new group purchasing agreement with HealthTrust Purchasing Group (“HPG”) for respiratory heaters and accessories. The agreement by the name The Respiratory Heaters & Accessories (HPG-6071) became effective on Dec 1, 2017. The agreement covers Teleflex’s full line of Active Humidification, Non Invasive Ventilation (NIV) and High Flow Nasal Cannula Therapy (“HFNCT”) products. More than 400 member hospitals of HealthTrust can now access Teleflex’s wide range of humidification products including the Hudson RCI Neptune Heated Humidifier with ConchaSmart Technology and ISO-GardHeated Wire Circuit Technology besides the recent introduction of Comfort FloPlus High Flow Nasal Cannula. The contract also complements Teleflex’s existing General Respiratory Agreement (HPG-184) with HealthTrust. Both these contracts — exclusive for Teleflex — provide HPG members with an opportunity to consolidate their respiratory purchases with a single supplier.Notably, HFNCT has been growing at 20% rate year over year. This therapy has been shown to improve patient outcomes and reduce 90-day mortality rates compared with noninvasive ventilation and Standard Oxygen Therapy. Based on this data, we expect Teleflex’s deal with HealthTrust to be strategically accretive to the former and might as well boost its top line significantly in the coming period. Taking cues from above, Teleflex has been putting in a lot of efforts on strategic expansion and top-line growth. In September, the company had made a substantial investment in the growing field of Urology. It has made a $1.1 billion acquisition of NeoTract, a privately-held developer of minimally invasive and clinically effective devices. Apart from strengthening Teleflex’s presence in the Urology market, the company expects this buyout to accelerate the company's near-term sales growth trajectory and provide it with significant sales channel opportunity. Additionally, this should enhance Teleflex's organic growth profile in the long term.Over the past three months, Teleflex has been trading above the broader industry. The stock has gained 5.2% compared with the broader industry’s 1.1% gain during the period.Zacks Rank & Key PicksTeleflex carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A few better-ranked medical stocks are PetMed Express, Inc. (PETS  -  Free Report), Align Technology, Inc. (ALGN  -  Free Report) and Luminex Corporation (LMNX). Notably, PetMed, Align Technology and Luminexsport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

780,ALGN,"A momentous healthcare consolidation has commenced with CVS Health Corporation (CVS  -  Free Report) deciding to acquire the U.S. health insurance giant Aetna Inc. AET for a colossal sum of $69 billion. Per a Yahoo Finance article by Julia La Roche, this one valuable deal could reshape the landscape of American health care.Following this news, shares of the company have been slightly down (about 0.23%) in pre-market trading on Dec 4.Deal DetailsOn Dec 3, CVS Health announced that under a definitive merger agreement, the company will acquire all outstanding shares of Aetna in cash and stock for approximately $207 per share or almost $69 billion (considering a rough estimate of Aetna's debt, the total transaction value is calculated at $77 billion).  More specifically, Aetna’s shareholders will receive $145.00 per share in cash and 0.8378 CVS Health shares for each Aetna share.CVS Health noted that the terms of this merger agreement have been unanimously approved by the respective board of directors of the two companies involved.Post the close of the transaction, Aetna’s shareholders will own nearly 22% of the combined entity while CVS Health shareholders will acquire the rest. The company expects the takeover to complete in the second half of 2018, subject to approval by both the company’s shareholders, regulatory approvals as well as fulfillment of certain other customary closing conditions.Synergy Benefit ForecastOn the deal’s successful completion, CVS Health expects to earn $750 million from near-term synergies with low to mid-single digit accretion in the second year post the transaction’s closure.Per the company, shareholders can look forward to several outcomes with respect to near-term synergy including enhanced competitive positioning and a new combined platform that might redefine access to high-quality care at low cost, substantially accelerating the consolidated business’ growth. The acquirer is highly optimistic about this merger, slated to combine the analytics of Aetna with its ‘touch of humanity’ on the health care turf and help create a robust platform to serve individuals better.Per CVS Health, this merger in the long term has great potential to deliver a significant incremental value as it is likely to spur development of new products and generate new-growth opportunities as a uniquely integrated retailer, pharmacy benefits manager and a far-sighted health planner.Share Price ComparisonShares of CVS Health have outperformed the broader industry over the past three months. The stock has dropped 3.5%, comparing favorably with the industry’s 9.1% decline during the same time frame.

782,ALGN,"A lot has been said about the President’s latest and most-controversial $1.5 trillion tax move and its impact on the economy once it’s passed. So far, the reaction of the hoi polloi has been mixed with people in favor of the Republicans treating the latest move as a big stimulant for economic growth that could offset any financial deficit. According to them, this new system will replace the existing “complicated, antiquated, and unfair” tax code that has not been updated for more than 30 years.Opponents, however, slammed the new plan as a 'job killer'. Per a report by The New York Times, “critics say a deficit-financed tax cut is at odds with longstanding Republican calls for fiscal discipline, including that tax cuts not add to the ballooning federal deficit. The federal debt topped $20 trillion earlier this month and is projected to grow by another $10 trillion over the next decade.”No Talk on MedTech Tax RepealThere is still lack of clarity in the MedTech space, which is unable to gauge the impending impact of the latest tax bill. In this regard, we note that the community was extremely hopeful about Trump’s regulatory agenda as it promised the abolition of the infamous 2.3% medical device tax.The dreaded tax, commonly addressed as 'fund of the ACA', dealt a heavy blow to the medical device industry since its enactment in 2013. This tax, imposed on the selling price instead of net profit and amounting to a stupendous sum, wiped out almost a quarter of the profit of medical technology companies. Realizing this, the U.S. House and Senate temporarily suspended it for two years at the beginning of 2015.Going by the available data,  it is quite evident that this partial two-year repeal of the medical device tax has benefited the sector’s overall development. Per data provided by the medical device trade group (in a Ken Blackwell article published by The Daily Caller), within this period, there was roughly an 83% rise in research and development (R&D) investments by MedTech players.The Republicans’ current stance of being tightlipped about this tax increases the probability of its return in 2018. Undoubtedly, its comeback will be an additional burden for the MedTech fraternity, largely discouraging R&D activities.Dental Bears the Brunt TooThe condition of the U.S. dental industry (a significant part of the Medical device space) is equally bad. Notably, this sector posted a stellar performance on the bourse over the last five years, gaining 103.6% and outperforming the S&P 500’s gain of just 87%.Unfortunately, given the political challenges, the performance of the industry has deteriorated and over the last two years, it has gained just 11.8%, much lower than the S&P 500’s gain of almost 25%. Furthermore, a discouraging broader industry rank (among Bottom 31% of more than 250 industries) indicates persisting concerns for the dental space. We also note that this industry’s projected earnings per share growth rate is 8.7%, lower than the S&P 500’s 9.8%.4 Dental Stocks to Bet OnOwing to the adversities, market watchers have adopted a bearish stance toward the dental space. At present, only four dental stocks are expected to beat the ongoing MedTech blues.

783,ALGN,"On Nov 15, we issued an updated research report on Genomic Health Inc (GHDX  -  Free Report), a global cancer research company with focus on advanced molecular diagnostics.Genomic Health has been trading below the broader industry over the past three months. The stock has lost 2.7%, wider than the broader industry’s 1.8% decline.Revenues in the third quarter of 2017 lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate due to disruption from the hurricanes in certain regions of the United States (estimated to have affected domestic test volumes by approximately 3%). The company’s rising operating losses also continue to be a concern. Its sole reliance on profitability of Breast Oncotype DX test is another challenge to cope with. Above all, management’s decision not to issue any guidance has been discouraging too as it failed to provide us with visibility about the company’s upcoming performance.However, we are encouraged by the year-over-year rise in revenues, driven by solid performances in the United States and internationally. During the third quarter, international test volumes expanded 14%, representing 26% of total test volumes in the quarter. While revenues grew around 7% year over year.So far, Genomic Health has witnessed a healthy progress with regard to establishing coverage for its Oncotype DX breast cancer test. In 2018, Genomic Health expects several key catalysts to drive strong revenue growth. These catalysts include the anticipated implementation of both PAMA (Protecting Access to Medicare Act) reimbursement at a higher level than the 2016 invasive breast rate and AJCC (American Joint Committee on Cancer) staging criteria that will become effective in January 2018.Within prostate cancer business, the Oncotype DX Genomic Prostate Score test received a positive Local Coverage Determination to expand Medicare coverage by Palmetto GBA. The company also made some positive developments for its Oncotype DX Breast Recurrence Score tests. In addition, it established private coverage for the test in Germany.Zacks Rank & Key PicksGenomic Health carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A few better-ranked medical stocks are PetMed Express, Inc.

This portfolio is capable of meeting any clinical requirement for NGS-based in vitro diagnostic (IVD) products.  According to Markets and Markets, the global next-generation sequencing market is estimated to reach a worth of $12.45 billion by 2022, at a CAGR of 20.5%.Illumina is striving to expand its NGS platform.

786,ALGN,"Myriad Genetics, Inc.’s (MYGN  -  Free Report) wholly owned subsidiary Assurex Health recently formed an alliance with the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) in PRIME Care (PRecision Medicine In MEntal Health Care) — a multi-center and national trial to evaluate the effectiveness of GeneSight test in improving health resultsfor veterans suffering from major depressive disorder (MDD).Slated to complete in 2021, PRIME Care is expected to enroll 2,000 patients with MDD. Moreover, the trial will include pharmacogenomic testing evaluating patients’s response to GeneSight-guided therapy. The study will also include 250 healthcare providers at 21 VA medical centers.The market for MDD therapy is growing at a rapid pace. Per the company, veterans have been found to suffer from MDD or some other mental health disorder with high suicide rates. In addition, the company stated that roughly 20% of the 2.6 million soldiers positioned in Iraq or Afghanistan have been suffering from some form of mental health disease or MDD. We believe a favorable outcome from the study might drive the uptake of GeneSight tests.As GeneSight is in the initial stages of adoption and is placed in a highly under-penetrated preventive care market, the product has huge growth potential. Also, management has been taking necessary steps to strengthen the GeneSight testing platform.In this regard, in November 2017, Assurex Health announced favorable results from a multi-center, double-blind and randomized controlled trial evaluating the impact of GeneSight Psychotropic test on psychiatric treatment response in 1,200 patients with major depressive disorder. Moreover, in October, Assurex Health announced favorable results for the test in patients with Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD). This favorable data, supporting the superiority of GeneSight test for better treatment of patients with GAD, was presented at the 25th World Congress of Psychiatric Genetics meeting in Orlando.In the last reported first quarter of fiscal 2018, the company witnessed a 300% rise in GeneSight test revenues under the highest revenue-grossing Molecular diagnostic test segment (accounting for 94% of total revenues). Thus, Myriad Genetics’ latest alliance seems to be in line with the company’s expectations to witness consistent growth in GeneSight test revenues in the quarters ahead.Myriad Genetics has been consistently gaining investors’ confidence with positive results. Over the last three months, the stock has gained 12.6% against the 4.9% loss of the broader industry. Zacks Rank & Other Key PicksMyriad Genetics currently carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Other top-ranked medical stocks are PetMed Express, Inc.

The stellar performance was driven by steady year-over-year revenue growth in both of the company’s subsidiaries.Within Chemed’s VITAS business, management noted that the recent admission trends have been positive and the momentum is expected to continue. During first-quarter 2018, VITAS performed well financially and operationally on an increase in the geographically weighted average Medicare reimbursement rate and average daily census. A decline in Medicare Cap also lent support to revenues.Moreover, we are encouraged by VITAS' median length of stay in the recently reported quarter, which in turn is a key indicator of the company’s penetration into the high acuity sector of the market.The Roto-Rooter business also saw consistent growth on strong performance by the core plumbing and drain cleaning service segments as well as solid growth in water restoration.

792,ALGN,"Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (EW  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 earnings on Jul 26, after market close.Last quarter, the company had posted a positive earnings surprise of 14.63%. It is worth noting that Edwards Lifesciences has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the preceding four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 7.21%. Let’s take a look at how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayEdwards Lifesciences posted strong global sales in the last reported quarter, primarily buoyed by strength in Transcatheter Heart Valve(TAVR). Banking on continued therapy adoption across all geographies with notable strength in the U.S., the company is expected to maintain this bullish trend in the second quarter of 2017 as well.In the TAVR space, Edwards Lifesciences reported highly encouraging European post-approval clinical trial results for its SAPIEN 3 transcatheter heart valve in May 2017. The company also demonstrated successful results pertaining to its CENTERA valve for transcatheter aortic valve replacement procedures in the much awaited EuroPCR 2017 held in May.Edwards Lifesciences Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Edwards Lifesciences Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Edwards Lifesciences Corporation QuoteWe are also upbeat about the company’s initiative of strategic investment in research and development and receipt of regulatory approvals for those products. Moving on, the latest breakthrough achieved in its TAVR segment is the FDA approval for its SAPIEN 3 valve in early Jun 2017.Bullish on the company’s ongoing performance, management raised growth expectations to the high end of the projected full-year 2017 guidance for each segment.Moreover, we note that the company projected total sales between $810 million and $850 million and adjusted earnings per share of 82 cents to 92 cents for the second quarter.Apart from this, management completed the acquisition of Israel-based Valtech Cardio, a developer of Cardioband System for transcatheter repair of the mitral and tricuspid valves, toward the end of 2016. All these are expected to boost the top line in the quarter to be reported.On the flip side, tough competition in the cardiac devices market and reimbursement issues continues to challenge the company. We also believe that unfavorable foreign currency will affect the company’s gross margin in to-be-reported quarter.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for Edwards Lifesciences this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

793,ALGN,"Quest Diagnostics Inc. (DGX  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 earnings results before the opening bell on Jul 25.Last quarter, the company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 16 cents, delivering a positive earnings surprise of 13.68%. It is worth noting that Quest Diagnostics outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the preceding four quarters at an average of 5.15%. Let’s take a look at how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayPosing a threat to Quest Diagnostics’ revenue per requisition performance, the last reported first-quarter 2017 saw a 20-basis points (bps) decrease in the same. Moreover, we remain apprehensive, as the company’s two Professional Lab Services (PLS) engagement, WJ Barnabas Health and HealthONE System of HCA Holdings, Inc. (HCA) carry lower revenue per requisition due to the nature of work.This apart, unit price headwinds had  less than 100 bps in the first quarter. While unit price headwinds stayed in moderate ranges (at approximately 1%) over the last few years, the company continues to expect the same for 2017 too.Quest Diagnostics Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise  Quest Diagnostics Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise | Quest Diagnostics Incorporated QuoteAlso, over the last two years, Quest Diagnostics faced several reimbursement issues that affected its revenues. The company is concerned about the CMS (Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services) proposal related to Protecting Access to Medicare Act (PAMA). However, while reimbursement pressure has likely acted as an overhang on performance in the to-be-reported quarter, the company expects to beat the pressure through test and business mix.On a positive note, as observed in the reported first quarter of fiscal 2017, Quest Diagnostics seems to be determined to stimulate performance by adhering to its two-point growth strategy – Accelerate growth and Drive operational Excellence.We are also optimistic about the successful execution of the company’s strategy to grow its esoteric testing business and drive profitable growth.Also, in the recent past, Quest Diagnostics witnessed significant growth through infectious disease testing, prescription drug monitoring and industry-leading wellness business. We expect these growth drivers to remain active through the second quarter as well, driving the same metrics as in the preceding quarter.We believe all these recent developments will significantly contribute to the company’s top line in the second quarter.The company currently expects full-year 2017 revenues within the range of $7.64 billion to $7.72 billion (annualized growth of 2–3%). The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $7.69 billion, close to the low end of the company’s guided range. In addition, the company’s 2017 adjusted earnings per share have been forecasted between $5.45 and $5.60. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.56 is within this range.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Quest Diagnostics is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

Align announced its addition to the prestigious S&P 500 Health Care Supplies Sub-Industry Index in Jun 2017.In the same month, the company announced another encouraging step toward strengthening its position in the Invisalign brand – the company’s most popular offering. In keeping up with the company’s strategies of expansion and investment in the rapidly growing Asia-Pacific region, Align announced plans to build its first Invisalign manufacturing facility in China.We are upbeat about the receipt of two U.S. patents for Align’s SmartTrack aligner material that is used exclusively for Invisalign aliner treatment in May 2017. Moving on, in a bid to gain traction in the same platform, in Mar 2017, Align collaborated with Digital Smile Design.

795,ALGN,"One of the world’s largest medical technology, services and solutions companies, Medtronic plc  (MDT  -  Free Report) is making efforts to expand its Pelvic Health & Gastric Therapies business, part of the company's core Restorative Therapies Group. The company has announced that its InterStim system provides sustained long-term efficacy and improved quality of life for overactive bladder (OAB) patients at the end of five years.What is the InterStim system?Notably, the InterStim system delivers sacral neuromodulation therapy for bladder control issues. InterStim therapy uses neuromodulation or gentle nerve stimulation to normalize the brain-bladder communication pathway. On the other hand, OAB hampers the quality of life by disturbing the routine activities of individuals because of urinary incontinence and excessive urination.InterStim system is thought to restore bladder function by targeting the sacral nerves to help alleviate symptoms.Taking the rapidly growing market of OAB into consideration, we expect this development to be perfectly strategic for Medtronic. Going by data provided by Medtronic, the number of OAB patients in America is over 37 million, which implies that one in every six individuals faces the problem in America. According to a market research report by Technavio’s analysts, the OAB therapeutics market will see a CAGR of almost 2% during the 2017–2021 period. InSite study results revealed that 82% of OAB patients had therapeutic success (greater than 50% improvement in symptoms) at the end of five years with sustained, safe and better quality of life. Notably, thestudy assessed the efficiency and safety of the system at five-years in patients who had bothersome OAB symptoms and could not tolerate more traditional treatments, including urinary urge incontinence (UI) and/or urgency-frequency (UF). However, implanting an InterStim system is as risky as any surgical procedure. Device-related unfavorable events were undesirable change in stimulation, implant site pain and ineffectiveness.Over the last six months, Medtronic has outperformed the S&P 500 index. As per the latest share price movement, the company has gained 14.3%, compared to the S&P 500’s 8.9% gain.Zacks Rank & Key PicksMedtronic currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).For the past year, Haemonetics has been trading above the Zacks categorized Medical - Products industry. Over this period, the stock has surged 34.7% compared with the broader industry’s 10.4%.We are particularly encouraged by the company’s consistent growth in both its Plasma segment as well as the Haemonetics Management franchises.Haemonetics has been witnessing a strong flourish in its Plasma franchise for quite some time now. Management has also maintained high confidence in the continued growth of its commercial plasma collection business.Of late, management declared that its NextGen plasma collection software has been seeing avid customer interest. Management’s 2018 guidance for Plasma revenue growth is 3-5% inclusive of the divestiture of SEBRA bench-top and handheld sealers, representing 1.4% of annual Plasma revenue in the fourth quarter of 2017.The company’s Hospital business is also progressing well. The TEG line of products has gained popularity worldwide. The TEG 5000 is approved of for a broad set of indications in all its top markets. The TEG 6s and TEG Manager are sanctioned for the same set of indications in Europe, Australia and Japan.In the U.S., TEG 6s is to be used for cardiovascular surgery and the company is presently pursuing a broader set of indications, beginning with trauma.On the flip side, the company has been witnessing sluggish revenue growth at the Blood Center franchise. This has significantly affected Haemonetics’ results over the past few quarters. Management also doesn’t expect any early recovery in the Blood Center’s outcomes.Macroeconomic uncertainty continues to pose a challenge for Haemonetics. Management also anticipates slower-than-expected product adoption by customers to reduce revenues and profits. Also, currency fluctuations and a stiff competition continue to hamper the stock.Other Key PicksSome better-ranked medical stocks are Mesa Laboratories, Inc.

800,ALGN,"Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (EW  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 earnings on Oct 24, after market close.Last quarter, the company had posted a positive earnings surprise of 22.7%. It is worth noting that Edwards Lifesciences has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the preceding four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 10.8%. Let’s take a look at how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Key CatalystSimilar to the prior quarter, Edwards Lifesciences is expected to gain from strength in Transcatheter Heart Valve Therapy segment (THVT). Banking on continued therapy adoption across all geographies with notable strength in the United States, the company is expected to maintain this bullish trend in the third quarter of 2017 as well.Growth in THVT was driven by excellent clinical performance results from SAPIEN 3 as well continued strong therapy implementation across all regions in the last reported quarter. Moreover, with the receipt of expanded FDA approval for SAPIEN 3 valve in early June 2017 is expected to further boost the top line at the THVT segment in the to-be-reported quarter.Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for THVT net sales of $496 million reflects an increase of 20.9% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for transcatheter heart valves (THV) sales in the United States of $322 million shows an increase of 23.8% from the year-ago quarter. Overall, third-quarter revenues are projected at $833.89 million.Edwards Lifesciences Corporation Price and EPS Surprise   Edwards Lifesciences Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Edwards Lifesciences Corporation QuoteHere are the other factors that might influence Edwards Lifesciences’ third-quarter results:In the domestic market, Edwards Lifesciences is expected to continue with its strong performance based on strength in THVT and two other segments — Surgical Heart Valve Therapy and Critical Care.The company witnessed strength in Surgical Heart Valve Therapy on the back of strong uptake of the EDWARDS INTUITY Elite valve system. Progressing in Surgical Heart Valve Therapy, the company received FDA approval for INSPIRIS RESILIA aortic valves in July 2017. On the other hand, growth in Critical Care group was led by double-digit growth in Enhanced Surgical Recovery Program, especially in the United States.Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for net sales in the United States of $467 million reflects an increase of 11.9% from the year-ago quarter.Edwards Lifesciences earlier raised its full-year 2017 sales expectations to the high end of the previously provided range of $3.2-$3.4 billion.Moreover, we note that the company projected total sales between $810 million and $850 million and adjusted earnings per share of 80 cents to 90 cents for the third quarter.On the flip side, tough competition in the cardiac devices market and reimbursement issues continue to challenge the company.We also believe that unfavorable foreign currency will affect the company’s gross margin in the to-be-reported quarter. Also, management expects the third quarter to be the seasonally lowest quarter, which adds to the concerns.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:Edwards Lifesciencesdoes not have the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP forEdwards Lifesciences is -1.83%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Edwards Lifesciences carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of a positive earnings surprise.Nonetheless, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of 87 cents reflects a 27.9% improvement on a year-over-year basis.Stocks Worth a LookHere are a few medical stocks worth considering as they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Abbott (ABT  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.17% and a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

801,ALGN,"Boston Scientific Corporation (BSX  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Oct 26.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 3.23%. The trailing four-quarter average beat is pegged at 0.84%. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Key CatalystsWe are optimistic about the company’s gradually improving performance in Interventional Cardiology (IC), led by an innovative portfolio and robust commercial teams globally. The company while gaining share in a number of cardiovascular segments and DES (Drug Eluting Stent). continues to build momentum globally.Boston Scientific Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Boston Scientific Corporation price-eps-surprise | Boston Scientific Corporation Quote However, ahead of earnings release, we believe the quarter’s IC business to be grossly impacted by the company’s product recall issue within Europe. Notably, last February, the company recalled one of its prime products, the Lotus range of heart devices from Europe due to device malfunctions. The company also delayed submission of its U.S. marketing application for its Lotus Edge device.The above product line has little hope to return to the European and other markets before the fourth quarter. This might lead to a major setback for the company’s fast-growing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) business within IC in the soon-to-be-reported quarter.While we believe the downbeat IC business to earn some boost from the company’s recent $435-million acquisition of Switzerland-based Symetis SA, a full recovery may take time.Accordingly, the  Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter IC revenues is currently pegged at $580 million, lower than the sequentially last quarter’s reported number of $603 million.Other Factors at PlayAmong the segments, MedSurg is expected to demonstrate a consistent performance, led by endoscopy. Urology and Women’s Health are also estimated to grow beyond market levels, driven by investment strategies in key international geographies.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter endoscopy revenues is pegged at $403 million, significantly higher than the year-ago quarter’s reported figure of $367 million. For Urology and Women’s Health, the current Zacks Consensus Estimate of $266 million remains ahead of the year-ago reported tally of $248 million.On the flip side, severe currency headwinds that Boston Scientific has been facing of late, remain a concern. In fact, as the company records 47% of its sales from international markets, it remains highly exposed to currency fluctuations. In 2017, Boston Scientific expects an unfavorable foreign exchange challenge to the tune of $85 million on revenues and 700 bps or 8 cents per share on earnings.Overall, Boston Scientific’s third-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings are expected in the band of 29-31 cents per share on revenues of $2.18-$2.21 billion.Here’s what our quantitative model predicts:Boston Scientific does not have the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.

802,ALGN,"Weight management products and service provider, Nutrisystem Inc. (NTRI  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 25.Nutrisystem has an impressive track of beating estimates in all the four trailing quarters. Overall, the company’s record is favorable as evident from its four-quarter average positive surprise of 28.47%. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this quarter.Factors at PlayNutrisystem’s innovative products are expected to expand customer base that will eventually drive reactivation revenues, which is generated from existing customers after the first nine months of their purchase. However, a sluggish dieting market and intense competition are primary headwinds in the near term.For the third quarter of 2017, management expects revenues in the range of $153 million to $158 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter revenues is currently pegged at $155.0 million, up 24.4%. Meanwhile, adjusted EBITDA is anticipated in the range of $25.6 million to $27.6 million. Earnings per share are expected in the band of 42-47 cents per share.On a positive note, the company portrays an impressive price performance. In the past three months, shares of Nutrisystem have returned 3.5% as against the industry’s decline of 0.3%.However, overall activities of Nutrisystem during the third quarter were inadequate to win analysts’ confidence. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter fell 2 cents to 45 cents per share in the last 90 days.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Nutrisystem is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Nutrisystem has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. The Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 45 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Nutrisystem currently carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company’s ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Ranks #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions. NutriSystem Inc Price and EPS Surprise  NutriSystem Inc Price and EPS Surprise | NutriSystem Inc Quote Stocks that Warrant a LookHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Abbott (ABT  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.17% and carries a Zacks Rank #2.

803,ALGN,"Medical instruments manufacturer, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc. (TMO  -  Free Report) is slated to release third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 25, before the market opens.Last quarter, the company posted earnings of $2.30 per share, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.3%. In fact, Thermo Fisher’s earnings outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the past four quarters with an average beat of 2.3%. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Key CatalystThe acquisition of FEI has already started generating synergies and largely contributing to this Waltham MA-based company’s analytical instruments portfolio from the last two quarters. The acquisition has enabled Thermo Fisher to access FEI’s industry leading high-performance electron microscopy platform used for protein study and facilitating life-science research. This is also a vital highlight of the quarter to be reported.Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc Price and EPS Surprise Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc Price and EPS Surprise | Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc QuoteThermo Fisher anticipates realizing total synergies of approximately $80 million by the end of three years following the deal’s closure with about $55 million of cost synergies and roughly $25 million of adjusted operating income benefits from revenue-related synergies. This should get reflected in third-quarter 2017 performance.Overall, the company is gearing up for yet another quarter of strong analytical instruments segmental growth. In the third quarter, Thermo Fisher expects to see a positive impact from the electron microscopy business as well as strong volume leverage and productivity.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Analytical Instruments operating income is pegged at $233 million, in line with the sequentially last quarter’s reported number. Total revenue estimate for this segment also remains at an impressive level of $1.11 billion.Here are other factors that might influence Thermo Fisher’s third-quarter results:The company’s focus to boost growth through implementation of strategies and strengthening of its product offerings is encouraging. These initiatives are likely to help it post solid results in the third quarter.The company had spent $750 million on research and development in 2016 and the same trend is continuing through the last couple of quarters in 2017. A major development in this field is that Novartis’ chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T) therapy Kymriah, the first FDA-approved cell therapy for Leukemia, utilizes Thermo Fisher’s CTS Dynabeads Technology.We expect all innovations and product launches to significantly contribute to the company’s top line in the third quarter itself.The company’s aim to expand capabilities in the fast-growing Asia-Pacific zone as well as the emerging markets should also lead to impressive results. Standout contributors in recent times are China, India and South Korea. With strategic investments to support key customer applications, Thermo Fisher hopes to maintain this bullish momentum for the rest of 2017.Growth is also likely to be seen in applied markets such as, environmental and food safeties apart from life science. In addition, the company is currently betting on some key areas under focus with enormous opportunities. These are advancing precision medicines from mass spectrometry to the targeted gene sequencing and structural biology. However, we are apprehensive about Thermo Fisher citing a foreign exchange headwind on 2017 revenues and adjusted EPS. Also, an unfavorable macroeconomic condition continues to weigh heavily on the stock. Plus, stiff competition continues to impose challenges on the stock’s value.Here’s what our quantitative model predicts:Thermo Fisher has the right combination of the two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — for an earnings beat.

804,ALGN,"Intuitive Surgical’s (ISRG  -  Free Report) third-quarter results, scheduled for release on Oct 19, are expected to show steady growth in instruments and accessories revenues — one of the major revenue components. While this could majorly drive its third-quarter earnings, an expected improvement in revenues at all other segments should help the company generate solid results this season.It is important to note that Intuitive Surgical delivered positive earnings surprises in the past four quarters, the average being 7.8%. Similar to the prior quarter, strong procedure growth and increased sales of stapling and vessel sealing products are expected to be the main factors driving the surge in instrument and accessories revenues.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for instrument and accessories revenues stands at $394 million for the third quarter. This reflects an increase of 13.2% from the year-ago quarter. Continued development in European markets, solid access to the company’s products in Asia and new platforms in imaging and advanced instruments are likely to drive revenues at the segment.Intuitive Surgical, Inc. Price and Consensus  Intuitive Surgical, Inc. Price and Consensus | Intuitive Surgical, Inc. QuoteOther Factors at PlayWe believe that the growing adoption of Intuitive Surgical’s da Vinci system among physicians for general surgery, oncology, urology and gynecology procedures is a catalyst for the third quarter. Overall, Q3 revenues are expected at around $752.3 million, up 10.2% from the prior-year quarter. Below are the other factors that might influence Intuitive Surgical’s quarterly results this earnings season.Solid Procedure Trends: Expectations of outperformance in the Mature and Growth procedures, especially in general and thoracic surgery, is likely to boost the company’s top line. Added to this, solid growth in prostatectomy procedure volumes is likely to lend Intuitive Surgical a competitive edge in the broader prostate surgery market in the third quarter.Geographically, procedure growth in the third quarter is expected to be led by China, Germany and Japan. In Germany, procedure growth is likely to be supported by solid installed base expansion.Furthermore, procedure trends are expected to be solid globally, with growth led by general surgery and global urology segments.Systems & Service Unit Hold Promise: Solid growth in the company’s product and systems segment is expected to drive the company’s third-quarter earnings. In fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues at this segment stands at $216 million, up 5.4% on a year-over-year basis. The increase reflects higher system placements and operating lease revenues.  However, this might be partially offset by lower average selling prices and lease buyout revenues at the segment.Coming to revenues at the services segment, the Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at $145 million, up 11.5% on a year-over-year basis.Growth in System’s Installed Base: Buoyed by higher system placements and operating lease revenues, we expect the company’s total systems installed base to be 4231 units, up 82 units from the last quarter. It is important to note that Intuitive Surgical generated approximately $6 million in revenues from operating leases last quarter, compared with 4 million in the second quarter of 2016.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:Intuitive Surgical does not have the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Intuitive Surgical is -0.49%, as the Most Accurate estimate is $1.96 and the Zacks Consensus Estimates is pegged at $1.97. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Intuitive Surgical carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP.

805,ALGN,"CR Bard Inc.  is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 earnings, after market closes on Oct 24. Last quarter, the company reported adjusted earnings of $2.92, exceeding the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 8 cents. Also, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the last four quarters with an average beat of 4.03%.Delving into the fundamentals of the stock, let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this release.Factors at PlayWe believe that the growing adoption of the company’s flagship Lutonix drug coated-balloon (DCB) will continue to be the key growth catalyst in the to-be-reported quarter. In this regard, Lutonix DCB is used to treat patients suffering from peripheral arterial disease (PAD). Within the Endovascular business, peripheral PTA line sales are solely driven by accelerating demand for the Lutonix DCB in the United States. We expect this product to significantly contribute to the company’s top line in this quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third-quarter revenues is currently pegged at $989.8 million, up 5.1%.However, the management expects revenues growth of 5% to 6% on a reported basis. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, the company projects revenues to increase between 6% and 7% from the prior year.Furthermore, the company's investments in emerging markets have strengthened its position internationally. We are also upbeat on the solid contribution from the company’s vascular product line. The urology and oncology segments are likely to drive third-quarter sales.On a positive note, the company portrays an impressive price performance. In the past three months, shares of CR Bard have returned 1.0% compared with the industry’s decline of 4.7%.On the flip side, a challenging Med-tech environment, especially in the hernia fixation and peripheral stent businesses raises concerns. The company continues to witness significant pricing pressure as well. Also, unfavorable foreign currency will continue to hurt top- and bottom-line growth.Furthermore, uncertainties associated with the possibilities of a repeal of the Affordable Care Act under President Trump add to the company’s concerns.Earnings WhispersOur quantitative model doesn’t point to an earnings beat either this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for CR Bard is 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at $2.95.

806,ALGN,"ResMed (RMD  -  Free Report) is slated to report first-quarter fiscal 2018 results, after markets close on Oct 26. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 2.7%. with average earnings beat of 1.7% for three of the trailing four quarters. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Key CatalystsSimilar to the prior quarter, ResMed is expected to gain from strong performance in the domestic and international front. The company’s revenues in the domestic front were driven by solid growth in devices as well as low double-digit software sales growth in the previous quarter.Internationally, the company’s receipt of French reimbursement approval for telemonitoring buoys optimism. The company believes this reimbursement grant will drive the uptake of Air Solutions ecosystem, including the AirSense 10 and the AirCurve 10 device platforms as well as AirView and myAir software platforms in the to-be-reported quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for domestic revenues (including the contributions from Brightree) of $334 million reflects an increase of 10.9% from the year-ago quarter. Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for international revenues of $177 million indicates a rise of 7.5% from the year-ago quarter.Overall, fiscal first-quarter total revenues are projected at $501 million, up 7.7% from the prior-year quarter.ResMed Inc. Price and EPS Surprise ResMed Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | ResMed Inc. QuoteHere are the other factors that might influence ResMed’s first-quarter results:Management is particularly upbeat about top-line contributions from launches made in the last fiscal and the last reported quarter. The introduced products include the AirFit  N20, the AirFit  F20, AirTouch full face masks, and the world's smallest continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) — ResMed AirMini.ResMed continues to progress steadily on the back of its three-pronged growth strategy. In this regard, the company recently announced two tuck-in acquisitions under the Brightree product portfolio — Conduit Technology, LLC and AllCall Connect. Moreover, during the last reported quarter, the company progressed with Brightree's new offering Outcome and Assessment Information Set (OASIS) for the home health and hospice market. We expect this to get reflected in ResMed’s top line in the first quarter. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for Brightree revenues of $36.9 million reflects an increase of 11.5% from the year-ago quarter.On the flip side, management expects SG&A expenses margin in the band of 26-27% in the to-be-reported quarter, while it was 26.6% in fourth-quarter fiscal 2017. Also, R&D expenses margin is projected at 7-8% for first-quarter fiscal 2018 as compared to 6.6% in the preceding quarter. This guidance reflects another quarter of gloomy operating margin scenario.Meanwhile, the company generates a significant portion of its revenues from international markets. This exposes the company to foreign currency fluctuations. Notably, in the last reported quarter, foreign exchange movements hurt earnings by 3 cents per share, reflecting the unfavorable impact of the weaker Euro and stronger Australian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar. This is likely to dent results in the first quarter.Moreover, overall macroeconomic uncertainties are a major obstacle for the company’s international operations.Also, the market for sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) products is highly competitive with respect to product price, features and reliability. Other challenges like competitive bidding and reimbursement pressure continue to hurt the stock.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:ResMed does not have the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for ResMed is 0.00% as the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimates are pegged at 65 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: ResMed carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of a positive earnings surprise.Nonetheless, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of 65 cents reflects a 4.8% improvement on a year-over-year basis.Stocks Worth a LookHere are a few medical stocks worth considering as they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Abbott (ABT  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.17% and a Zacks Rank #2.

807,ALGN,"On August 10, I made a video to share with the public about a circle of stocks I owned in my Zacks portfolios that I felt were all in a race to $200…The $200 Club: Will Facebook Beat Alibaba There First?Here were their approximate closing prices on that day (rounded up to nearest dollar)…Alibaba (BABA  -  Free Report): $152Facebook (FB  -  Free Report): $168Lam Research (LRCX  -  Free Report): $150Align Technology (ALGN  -  Free Report): $172In the video that accompanies this article, I show fresh charts two months later of the ups and downs since that day.Clearly, most of these “high-flyers” were still great buys in August. Except Facebook which may have some trouble on its hands as it deals with “adjustments” in its advertising policing in the wake of the “fake news” epidemic.But I still recommend that long-term investors own and accumulate FB under $170.I also reveal a big mistake I made selling one memberof the $200 Club.Thankfully, I screwed my shrewd trader-investor head back on and bought NVIDIA (NVDA  -  Free Report) near $175 right before it made its run for all-time highs above $190.So now we have ALGN and NVDA leading the charge to $200, with BABA and LRCX running neck-and-neck near $184.In the video, I also take a look at the over-bought Philadelphia Semiconductor Index chart and what opportunity that might spell for us.By the way, if you are interested in the mental game of trading and the irrational, self-sabotage we all deal with as active investors, you might enjoy my podcast tribute to the latest Nobel prize in economic sciences winner, Richard Thaler.We can’t expect to be “perfect” as traders and investors, and knowing what trips us up, and what lifts us up, is key to top performance.Thaler probably doesn’t know much about active trading, but his and Daniel Kahneman’s life-long battles to bring psychology into economics – and thus give birth to behavioral economics – have helped my daily battles immensely.

808,ALGN,"Do you play or watch poker? Even if you don’t, you will not regret learning how to apply poker wisdom to investing in stocks.You can start with the video attached to this article or, for a quick and focused dive, check out this bit of applied wisdom I shared with my TAZR Trader members this week in a portfolio where we've successfully ""gamed"" the market and rode several stocks to new highs -- while all around us many expert players have said ""You can't buy that! It's too expensive!""When You Get the Best of It, Make the Most of ItThat's actually a quote by ""mathematics of gambling"" expert Mason Malmuth, in a book of his I read many years ago titled Gambling Theory and Other Topics.If you are familiar with the probability and statistics applications of poker to investing, you already know what Malmuth is talking about.The randomness and viciousness of poker demands that you ruthlessly apply optimally-rational probability-based thinking to your decisions -- in addition to deep and active psychoanalysis of your opponents.Some players are masters of poker-hand probability analysis and want very little opponent interaction, body language/facial “reading” or social gamesmanship.These are the players who wear sunglasses and try to avoid most interaction at the table.Then there are the true ""behavioral scientists"" like Daniel Negreanu. Since behavioral finance/economics are a pet project of mine -- and I started my Mind Over Money podcast this year in dedication to those fascinating arenas -- I am vastly interested in all related topics and Negreanu is an unparalleled practitioner of applied behavioral science.He is so secure with his probability-weighted strategies for any given hand that he can spend the majority of his time and attention at the table analyzing, dissecting and “gaming” player behavior and interactions -- which is where the real difference and edge is found in games with a high ""randomness component.""This focus and meta-awareness of the table, the deck, and the players gives him an uncanny ability to determine what cards his opponents are likely holding. It may begin with a hunch or guess, but as he verbalizes, jokes and sometimes taunts other players he can nearly always confirm his suspicions with an amazing degree of accuracy.If you want to learn how to play poker, better or at all, watch or read Negreanu.Now, what does this have to do with investing in or trading stocks?#1: Know Your Probability Scenarios#2: Play Your Opponents for Both their Strengths & WeaknessesFor us, this comes down to (1) Knowing our risk/reward in every trade and then (2) Gaming the institutional demand we expect at different price levels.Short-term technical traders who use price charts and indicators, including volume, live and die by this analysis.What I do with my short-to-medium term portfolio, where I may hold fundamentally-strong stocks through several quarterly earnings reports, is like a bigger version of the short-term technical analysis game, but with the added fundamental and behavioral components.Cautious Players Who Get It Wrong, Curious Ones Who Get It RightWhile big name fund managers like Ray Dalio of Bridgewater or Howard Marks, of value/distressed investment firm Oaktree Capital, come out waving red flags, we have to be able to discern if they are being overly conservative, once again, and missing the next leg of a big global economic cycle that could last for another 2 years.Other successful “players” at the table like David Tepper of Appaloosa, Dan Loeb of Third Point, Steve Mandel of Lone Pine, Lee Ainslee of Maverick Capital, and Andreas Halvorsen of Viking Global are not wringing their hands about global macro worries. They are still “heads down, picking stocks” for the long-run of 2 to 5 years. Like Alibaba (BABA  -  Free Report).And it’s important to keep the history of this “table” in perspective too. There have been numerous high-profile calls for a market melt-down in the past 2 years. Jeff Gundlach and the perma-bear Albert Edwards from SocGen also come to mind.But in all their macro analysis, they miss the simplest of factors: technological innovation + investment liquidity ($66 trillion tied to global equity markets) + stable economic growth and liquidity (favorable interest rates) = equities as the premier growth investment over many years of a long cycle.Overcomplicating this equation only leads to missing great and lengthy rallies.This has happened several times in my career trading growth stocks. And it is why I think we should still be buying growth stocks on the dips in this bull market to S&P 3,000.Because I have little reason to believe this time will be different.But if you want to dissect the behavior of one player who is convinced something is wrong and he’s throwing in the towel, check out the video that accompanies this article where I share the news this month of a fund manager who called it quits, citing how “wrong” and ""almost impossible"" the stock market is.Why You Still Buy Alibaba for $200 and BeyondI also share more insight on why I remain an investor in Alibaba shares at these levels. It seems every week Jack Ma and company reveal another market initiative that is sure to capture new and expanded sources of revenue in China and globally as they continue their dominant growth in multiple business segments.And in the video, I also show you which fund managers were still buying or starting new positions in Alibaba in the second quarter.Finally, I review what's going on with my ""$200 Club"" where I mistakenly sold Lam Research (LRCX  -  Free Report) on Monday and added NVIDIA (NVDA  -  Free Report) today.

The stock has gained 7.4% in this period as compared to 1% growth of the industry. The company’s strong InvisAlign Technology prospects and growth in North America and international regions look encouraging.Align Technology witnessed balanced sales growth across all its channels over the recent past, primarily driven by continued strong InvisAlign Technology case volumes across all customer channels and geographies.Align Technology, Inc.

Per the non-exclusive agreement, effective September 2017, Align Technology’s iTero Element intraoral scanning system will be available as part of Patterson Dental’s CAD/CAM portfolio in the United States and Canada. We are also upbeat about the company’sopening of a new InvisAlign Technology Treatment Planning facility in China. The company’s receipt of two U.S. patents for SmartTrack Aligner material also buoys optimism.On the contrary, foreign exchange headwinds continue to raise concerns for Align Technology’s international operations.

810,ALGN,"After weeks of shaky trading, the Wall Street continued its second-largest bull run, dodging the list of woes including geopolitical tension, Washington turmoil, elevated valuations, the aftermath of hurricanes Harvey & Irma as well as rounds of downbeat economic data.In particular, the S&P 500 is in the spotlight, with the index breaching the 2,500 milestone for the first time, bringing its year-to-date gains to nearly 12%. According to Bloomberg, this rally overtook the 266% increase in the index during the 1949-56 bull run and added almost $20 trillion to the value of American equities. The journey of 100 points came in less than four months, suggesting strong complacency in the stock market.Renewed hopes for Trump’s tax reform by the end of the year is the main catalyst in driving the stock market to new highs. Additionally, steady economic fundamentals and strong corporate earnings added to the strength. The upward trend is likely to continue in the months ahead (read: ETF Asset Report: U.S. Equities Rule).Given the enthusiasm, investors are flocking to its ETF, iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV  -  Free Report). Let’s take a closer look at the fundamentals of IVV and its performance.IVV in FocusIVV is the top asset creator this year pulling in nearly $24.1 billion in capital. It tracks the S&P 500 Index and holds 505 stocks in its basket, with each security holding no more than 3.85% of total assets. This suggests a nice balance across each security and prevents heavy concentration. However, the product is slightly tilted toward information technology sector with 23.1% share while health care, financials, consumer discretionary and industrials account for a double-digit exposure each. The ETF is the low cost choice in the space, charging 4 bps in fees per year from investors and trades in solid volume of 3.4 million shares a day on average.The fund has gained 13.1% in the year-to-date time frame and has a Zacks ETF Rank #2 (Buy) with a Medium risk outlook. Though most of the stocks in the fund’s portfolio have delivered impressive returns, a few were the real stars gaining more than 60% (read: ETF Industry to Face Regulatory Oversight?).Below, we have highlighted the five best-performing stocks in the ETF with their respective positions in the fund’s basket:Best Performing Stocks of IVVVertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX  -  Free Report): The stock has surged 108.5% so far this year and carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) with a VGM Style Score of A.

Per the agreement, Align Technology’s iTero Element intraoral scanning system will be available under Patterson Dental’s CAD/CAM portfolio in the United States and Canada. This will boost the iTero scanner customer base to a considerable extent.Further, in June, Align Technology had announced its inclusion in the esteemed S&P 500 Index, which boosted investors’ confidence in the stock considerably.We are also encouraged by Align Technology’s solid second-quarter 2017 performance with year-over-year increase in earnings and revenues. The company’s encouraging InvisAlign Technology prospects and growth in North America and international regions also raise hopes. The company recently opened a new InvisAlign Technology Treatment Planning facility in China.

812,ALGN,"On Aug 21, we issued an updated research report on Denver, CO-based BioScrip, Inc. (BIOS  -  Free Report). The company is a leading Infusion Service provider and strives to deliver cost-effective programs to patients. The stock currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Over the past month, BioScrip has been trading above the broader industry. The stock has gained 3.7% in this period, as against the industry’s 9% loss. The market is upbeat about the company’s announcement to continue to offer certain core product lines to UnitedHealthcare. This deal should be significantly accretive to BioScrip’s top line.The company’s progress for new multi-faceted CORE plan to improve financial position is also encouraging. The plan involves identifying and executing strategies to accelerate core revenue growth, favorable product mix, drive operational efficiency, improve revenue collection and increase employee effectiveness.Further, BioScrip had successfully completed the Home Solutions’ integration earlier this year. The company expects core revenues as well as continued growth from this acquired asset to prove accretive, going forward.Notably, BioScrip has been recording persistent growth in its core Infusion Services business with strong presence as well as a competitive advantage. The company witnessed a consistent rise in this business, primarily on account of strong organic growth in chronic, nutrition and other therapies. It has been building a robust core Infusion platform through organic development and acquisitions.Management expects BioScrip’s focus on the fast-growing core Infusion business to drive an increased profitability. The company is currently on track to achieve the previously announced $17 million in Home Solutions synergies and other incremental annualized cost-reductions of $23-$25 million by 2017-end.On the flip side, BioScrip’s 2017 guidance is lackluster with the inclusion of an estimated negative impact of the Cures Act legislation. A large portion of the company’s revenues used to come directly from Medicare, state Medicaid programs or other government payers. However, the new Cures Act bill does not reimburse any service payments for administration of certain drugs to patients via home infusion pharmacies.The healthcare industry is also highly competitive. BioScrip’s competitors include large and well-established companies with higher financial, marketing and technological resources.Key PicksA few better-ranked medical stocks are IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. (IDXX  -  Free Report), Lantheus Holdings, Inc. (LNTH  -  Free Report) and Align Technology, Inc. (ALGN  -  Free Report).

813,ALGN,"California-based Align Technology, Inc. (ALGN  -  Free Report) recently signed a distribution agreement with Patterson Dental, a business unit of Patterson Companies, Inc. (PDCO  -  Free Report).Per the non-exclusive agreement, effective September 2017, Align Technology’s iTero Element intraoral scanning system will be available as part of Patterson Dental’s CAD/CAM portfolio in the United States and Canada. Thus, we believe Align Technology’slatest deal will boost the iTero scanner customer base to a considerable extent.We are also optimistic about the company’s expanding work flow options for its leading iTero scanners. In this context, Align Technology recently launched a software upgrade to its iTero Element intraoral scanner that is capable of comparing patient scans over time with the latest TimeLapse technology.Also, Align Technology collaborated with exocad GmbH in March, whereby the integrated portfolio will result in high-tech workflow solution for efficient scanning, designing and manufacturing of in-house dental prosthesis. In February, the company announced the addition of digital workflow for Nobel Biocare implants to its iTero intraoral scanner portfolio.Interestingly, revenues from Scanner and Service improved a substantial 36.7% in the last reported second quarter 2017. Moreover, the company saw increased adoption of iTero scanners for Invisalign case submissions instead of PVS impressions, especially in North America, thereby driving Invisalign utilization. In line with the latest developments in the iTero scanner space, Align Technology’s latest deal buoys optimism.Per a report by MedGadget, the global market for 3D Dental Scanners is projected to see a CAGR of 10.2% over the 2017-2021 period.Considering the market potential and Align Technology’s current developments in the scanners and services space, this collaboration seems to be a strategic one.We believe an unhealthy lifestyle and rising awareness and expenditure in healthcare will continue to drive growth in the 3D Dental scanners market. However, this market is dominated by many well established players, with DENTSPLY SIRONA being a prominent one.Align Technology has been gaining investor confidence on consistent positive results. Over the past three months, the company’s share price has outperformed the broader industry. The stock has gained 22.3%, as against the broader industry’s 0.9% fall. The company has also outperformed the 1.3% gain of the S&P 500 market over the same time frame. Zacks Rank & Key PicksAlign Technology currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

814,ALGN,"The first-quarter earnings season saw a starry start with most of the 87 S&P 500 members beating earnings and maintaining revenue momentum as of Apr 20. However, the number of positive revenue surprises is lagging the preceding year’s numbers but is on par with the sequential figures.Per the latest Earnings Preview, total earnings for the companies that have reported so far are up 25% year over year on 10.7% higher revenues. Of the total, 82.8% beat earnings and 67.8% surpassed revenue estimates. This week, 178 S&P 500 members are lined up to release their quarterly results. We expect to get a clearer picture of what the first-quarter earnings season has in the offing by the end of the week.Medical Sector in a SnapshotMedical, one of the 16 Zacks sectors, is expected to stand out this quarter. The sector benefits from favorable consumer behavior, growing prevalence of minimally-invasive surgeries, demand for liquid biopsy tests, use of IT for ensuring quick and improved patient care along with the shift of the payment system to a value-based model.Broadly speaking, the latest Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which among many other changes, slashed corporate tax rates to 21% from the earlier 35%, has also buoyed optimism among inventors.The Medical Product space, which is part of the broader Medical sector, has been hogging a lot of limelight on certain favorable developments. Considering favorable demographics, changing market dynamics toward Artificial Intelligence (AI) & big-data applications, upbeat consumer sentiment and increased business investments, this sector has been going strong.Further, the Senate’s decision to defer the implementation of an industry-wide excise tax for another couple of years, known as the Medical Device tax, has instilled confidence in investors. The tax will be put into effect on Jan 1, 2020. The bill also delays the so-called Cadillac tax, a 40% tax on employer insurance, until 2022.Moreover, MedTech companies have been riding high on R&D innovation, growing consolidation and focus on emerging market.Against this backdrop, let’s take a look at the major Medical Product stocks scheduled to release results on Apr 25:Per the quantitative Zacks model, stocks with the advantageous combination of a solid Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP have higher chances of beating estimates.

815,ALGN,"Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and Align Technology, Inc. (ALGN  -  Free Report) may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Align Technology is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings—with the most up-to-date information possible—is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for ALGN in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $1.01 per share for ALGN, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of 98 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for ALGN, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of 2.96% heading into earnings season.Align Technology, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Align Technology, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Align Technology, Inc. QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market.

You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Clearly, recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for Align Technology, and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?

816,ALGN,"CVS Health (CVS  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on May 2, before the opening bell. In the last reported quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 1.6%. Its trailing four-quarter average positive earnings surprise is 2.5%.Let’s take a look at how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayCVS Health has so far progressed well with its 2018 PBM selling season. Per the last-reported numbers, gross new business wins totaled $6.2 billion while net new business wins grossed $2.4 billion along with an impressive client retention rate. This momentum is expected to continue in the to-be-reported quarter.Despite tough pricing competition, CVS health is currently gaining on high level of service and execution, competitive pricing along with unique integrated model.The company is also upbeat about sustaining the solid year-over-year earnings trend in the first quarter of 2018 on gains to be realized from the Pharmacy Services segment. The performance is being driven by higher specialty pharmacy and pharmacy network claim volumes as well as brand inflation.Management stated that CVS Health’s specialty business is its top priority to help the company expand its customer base. CVS Health is poised to capitalize on this opportunity on the back of wide and differentiated offerings, including Specialty Connect.CVS Health Corporation Price and EPS Surprise CVS Health Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | CVS Health Corporation QuoteFurther, the company expects drug price inflation, product launches and higher utilization to fuel growth. We expect the Pharmacy Services segment to be a stable growth platform.CVS Health also projects better-than-expected performance in the to-be-reported quarter primarily on the back ofscript utilization at retail. The company has projected a 1.5-3.25% rise in consolidated net revenues for the first quarter.Further, a strong flu season has led to the improved outlook. Overall, for the first quarter of 2018, the company expects to register adjusted operating profit growth in the range of 0.5% to 4.5%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues of $45.82 billion reflects a 2.9% increase year over year.Although CVS Health’s Retail/LTC business registered revenue growth after several quarters of a slump in the last reported quarter, there are multiple factors raising concerns. Firstly, the year-over-year growth was just a marginal 0.3%.Further, continued reimbursement pressure, increasing generic dispensing rate andrecent generic drug introductions have been affecting the business. This apart, marketplace changes that kept CVS Pharmacy from participating in certain networks had a 320-basis point negative impact on same-store prescription volumes in the previously reported quarter.However, CVS Health has been striving to return to growth in the Retail/LTC business. Management claims that the company is focused on working with all payers to drive volumes and capture market share. CVS Health is also poised to gain from programs such as Health Tag and ExtraCare Health Card.The company also expects to witness revenue growth of 4% to 5.5% and operating profit growth in the low to mid-single digits range, within the Retail/LTC business.Here is What Our Quantitative Model Predicts:Our proven model does not conclusively show that CVS Health will beat estimates this earnings season. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a solid Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP:  CVS Health has an Earnings ESP of +1.94%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: CVS Health carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Please note that stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Strong Sell) should never be considered going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter adjusted EPS of $1.40 reflects a 19.7% increase year over year.Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few medical stocks worth considering with the right combination of elements to beat estimates this time around:Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings (LH  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.52% and a Zacks Rank #2.Henry Schein, Inc. (HSIC  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +2.53% and a Zacks Rank #3.Align Technology, Inc. (ALGN  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +2.96% and is a Zacks #3 Ranked player.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 19X over.

817,ALGN,"ResMed Inc. (RMD  -  Free Report) is slated to report third-quarter fiscal 2018 results after market close on Apr 26. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 28.2%. Moreover, the company surpassed estimates in all the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 8.6%.Let's see, how things are shaping up for this announcement.Key CatalystsResMed is expected to gain from a strong performance on the domestic as well as international front like the previous quarter. In the past few earnings, the company’s domestic revenues were driven by solid growth in devices and masks as well as a continued double-digit software sales rise. Moreover, the sleep apnea patient volume consistently witnessed steady growth. We expect these trends to find reflection in the impending third-quarter results as well.Internationally, revenues across Europe, Asia and other markets are likely to register a solid increase, banking on a strong device and masks performance. Within devices, sleep apnea patient volume should continue to expand through the company’s marketing efforts and channel partners. In Canada and Latin America, a sturdy uptake of AirSense 10 device platform and the Air Solutions cloud-based software platform should further add value to the company’s portfolio.ResMed Inc. Price and EPS Surprise ResMed Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | ResMed Inc. Quote In France, the company’s receipt of French reimbursement approval for telemonitoring buoys optimism in the stock. The company believes, this reimbursement grant will continue to drive the uptake of Air Solutions ecosystem including the AirSense 10 and the AirCurve 10 device platforms as well as AirView and myAir software platforms in the to-be-reported quarter. Moreover, the company keeps investing and expanding its footprint in the high-growth markets of China, South Korea, India, Brazil and several countries in Eastern Europe.Within mask and accessories outside the United States, the company is expected to benefit from nasal and full face categories, namely AirFit N20 and the AirFit F20, respectively.Per ResMed, with more than 1.5 billion nights of medical sleep and medical respiratory care data, the company is successfully working on simplifying workflow and improving patient outcomes. This improvement should drive the company’s top-line performance in the quarter, yet to be reported.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $217 million for international revenues indicates a rise of 19.2% from the year-ago quarter.Domestically, ResMed is extremely upbeat about the latest tax reform, which sees a transformation into a territorial tax system. This  in fact allows the company to invest its global cash assets without any artificial constraints. Per ResMed, it is now free to invest in three new ways: firstly, growing upon its existing strong U.S. manufacturing footprint; secondly, expanding its existing U.S.-based research and development capability and finally, building upon its existing valuable U.S.-based intellectual property assets. Effective January, this is expected to remain accretive to the company’s operational result in the fiscal third quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $366 million for domestic revenues (including contributions from Brightree) reflects an increase of 10.2% from the year-ago quarter.Other Factors Likely to Influence ResMed's Q3ResMed continues to progress on the back of its three-pronged growth strategy. In this regard, the company diligently aims at growth in the adjacent product and geographic markets including homecare ventilation for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and other respiratory disorders as well as the emerging markets of China, India and Brazil. ResMed still considers portable oxygen concentrators (POCs) an important addition to its menu of respiratory care products.Moreover, since ResMed’s acquisition of Brightree in fiscal 2016, the former has strongly progressed with the latter’s software-as-a-service business’ latest offerings targeting the home health and hospice market. We expect this upside to further boost ResMed’s top line in the third quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $39.7 million for Brightree revenues marks an increase of 13.4% from the year-ago quarter.Here’s what the quantitative model predicts:Per the proven Zacks model, a company with a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has good chances of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP.ResMed has a Zacks Rank #2, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, an Earnings ESP of +0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult. Thus, the combination does not suggest that the company is likely to beat on earnings this quarter.We caution against the Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few medical stocks worth considering with the right combination of elements to beat estimates this time around.Align Technology, Inc.

818,ALGN,"Align Technology, Inc. (ALGN  -  Free Report) is set to report first-quarter 2018 earnings results on Apr 25, after market close.Last quarter, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 24%. Align Technology has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all of the preceding four quarters, the average positive earnings surprise being 22.6%.Let’s take a look at how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Invisalign System — A Major Growth DriverSimilar to prior quarters, Align Technology is expected to gain from continued adoption of Invisalign Technology in the first quarter of 2018 as well. Accordingly, the company projects Invisalign case shipments in the band of 264,000-269,000 in the to-be-reported quarter, up 26.9-29.3% from a year ago.Notably, in November 2017, Align Technology announced the achievement of a milestone of five million patients undergoing treatment with its Invisalign system.Interestingly, considering the fast-expanding market for clear aligner therapy, Align Technology has undertaken several strategies to drive the adoption of its core Invisalign product line. These include product/technology development, extending clinical effectiveness, promoting the Invisalign brand name and boosting international growth.The company has also been focusing on increasing the Invisalign utilization by orthodontists. Particularly targeting the teenagers, Align Technology has adopted marketing strategies to accelerate consumer demand by allowing GP dentists to treat increased number of cases with the Invisalign system.Align Technology, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Align Technology, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Align Technology, Inc. QuoteStrength in Scanner and Service BusinessAlign Technology has also been witnessing strong revenue growth from the Scanner and Service business over the past few quarters. Moreover, the company has been witnessing increased adoption of iTero scanners for Invisalign case submissions instead of PVS impressions, especially in North America, thereby driving Invisalign utilization. Management expects this bullish trend to reflect in the company’s first-quarter results as well.At the same time, Align Technology has been focusing on expanding workflow options of iTero scanners. In this context, last November the company signed an agreement with Glidewell Dental to distribute the iTero Element intraoral scanning system with the latest glidewell.io In-Office Solution in North America.Align Technology had also signed a distribution agreement with Patterson Dental to make available its iTero Element intraoral scanning system as part of Patterson Dental’s CAD/CAM portfolio in the United States and Canada.Solid Global Prospects Align Technology had introduced a clear Aligner solution for teen Class II correction — the Invisalign Technology Teen with mandibular advancement — in certain markets of Canada, EMEA and APAC in 2017. These are indicative of the growing popularity of its dental products in the international market.Further, over the recent past, Align Technology reported strong international Invisalign Technology volumes on continued strong performance in both EMEA and APAC regions.In the last reported quarter, EMEA, volumes were up on continued adoption of Invisalign Technology in core markets like the U.K., Spain and France, as well as rapid growth in smaller markets like Eastern Europe, Central Europe, Middle East and Africa. In the Asia-Pacific region, the company witnessed an impressive volume growth led by China, Japan and Australia. We expect to see a similar trend in the yet-to-be-reported quarter result as well.Overall, Align Technology projects EPS of 94-98 cents on revenues of $400-$410 million in the first quarter of 2018. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues of $408 million in first-quarter 2018 indicates a rise of 37.4% from the year-ago quarter.What Our Quantitative Model SuggestsPer the proven Zacks model, a company with a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP.Align Technology has an Earnings ESP of +0.97% and a Zacks Rank #2, a combination that suggests the company to likely beat on earnings this quarter.

820,ALGN,"In a bid to fortify its Dental business, Henry Schein, Inc. (HSIC  -  Free Report) recently formed a joint venture with Internet Brands. Notably, Internet Brands is a provider of web presence and online marketing software for dental offices. Subject to certain customary closing conditions, the transaction is expected to be completed by the second quarter of 2018. However, the financial terms of the deal were kept under wraps.Henry Schein plans to integrate the portfolio of practice management systems under its dental practice management software company — Henry Schein Practice Solutions -- with Internet Brands’ web-based software applications to enhance dental practice management and marketing as well as improvise patient communication.Joint Venture in DetailThe companies will name the joint venture Henry Schein One. Notably, in comparison with Internet Brands, Henry Schein will hold majority ownership of the joint venture.Excluding the impact of one-time transfer taxes of around $4.5 million, Henry Schein anticipates the deal to be immaterial to the rest of 2018 earnings per share and accretive thereafter. Furthermore, between $20 million and $30 million in annual synergies are expected to be realized by the end of the third year of the joint venture initiation.Dental Business — A Major Growth DriverHenry Schein’s Dental business contributed to 50.6% of total revenues in the last reported quarter. Accordingly, it has been leaving no stones unturned to strengthen its hold in this business. In this regard, last year, Henry Schein signed distribution agreements with DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc. (XRAY  -  Free Report) to distribute the latter’s entire product line.We encouragingly note that Henry Schein banks on a part of its strategic plan, digital dentistry. The company is busy promoting digital workflows for general dentistry as well as dental specialties. Per management, the solid performance can be attributed to its continued focus on offering a diversified portfolio and value-added services along with favorable end market. Thus, we believe that the company’s latest tie-up is a strategic one.Market PotentialPer the company, in the dental industry, a rise in oral healthcare expenditures is predicted as population, ageing 45 years and above, increases.

822,ALGN,"The investing world is at present flustered with politics between the United States and China pertaining to trade. Both continue to slam import tariffs on each other. The heart of the last year’s market rally – the tech space – has also been wobbling lately on a host of issues.Against this kind of a shaky investing backdrop, only sweet surprises in corporate earnings can pull the market up. This is because, what every investor would want now is a quality pick. Stocks that are likely to beat earnings estimates fall in that category. After all, it is a positive earnings surprise or a beat that matters the most, irrespective of earnings growth.Why Is a Positive Earnings Surprise So Important?Historically, stocks of companies with solid quarterly earnings (on a nominal basis) tank if they miss or merely meet market expectations. After all, a 20% earnings rise (though apparently looks good) doesn’t tell you if it has been decelerating.Seasonal fluctuations also come into play. If a company’s Q1 is seasonally weak and Q4 is strong, it is likely to report a sequential earnings decline. In such cases, growth rates are misleading while judging the true health of a company.It’s only after significant research and analysis on a company’s financials and initiatives that Wall Street analysts project its earnings. They also take a company’s guidance into consideration when deriving an earnings estimate.Thus, outperforming that estimate is almost equivalent to beating the company’s own expectation as well as the market perception. If the margin of earnings surprise is big, it typically drives the stock higher right after the release. Thus, more than anything else, an earnings surprise can push a stock higher.How to Locate Potential Outperformers? Investors tend to look for stocks that have the potential to beat on the bottom line but might not always succeed. One way of identifying the winners beforehand is by looking at the earnings surprise history of a company.An impressive track record in this regard generally acts as a driver. It indicates the company’s ability to exceed estimates. Investors generally believe that the company will have the same trick up its sleeve to deliver yet another earning beat in its upcoming release.The Winning StrategyIn order to shortlist stocks that are likely to come up with an earnings surprise, we chose the following as our primary screening parameters.Last EPS Surprise greater than or equal to 10%: Stocks delivering positive surprise in the last quarter tend to surprise again.Average EPS Surprise in the last four quarters greater than 20%: We lifted the bar for outperformance slight higher by setting the average earnings surprise for the last four quarters at 20%.Average EPS Surprise in the last two quarters greater than 20%: This points to a more consistent surprise history and makes the case for another surprise even stronger.In addition, we place a few other criteria that push up the chance of a positive surprise.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Only companies with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) rating can get through.Earnings ESP greater than zero: A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank of #1, 2 or 3 for an earnings beat to happen, as per our proven model.In order to zero in on those that have long-term growth potential and high trading liquidity we have added the following parameters too:Next 3–5 Years Estimated EPS Growth (Per Year) greater than 10%: Solid expected earnings growth exhibits the stock’s long-term growth prospects.Average 20-day Volume greater than 100,000: High trading volume implies that the stocks have adequate liquidity.A handful of criteria has narrowed down the universe from over 7,700 stocks to eight.Here are five out of eight stocks that passed the screen:Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report): The company engages in the retail sale of consumer products and subscriptions in North America and internationally. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #1.

823,ALGN,"Align Technology, Inc. (ALGN  -  Free Report) has made an extension to its Invisalign clear aligner range with the latest launch of Vivera Retainers with Precision Bite Ramps. This is claimed to be the first-of-its retainers in the market, which can be customized to provide additional support after a deep bite correction.Notably, Vivera retainer is made with the same state-of-the-art technology as Invisalign aligners. It employs 3-D digital imaging, proprietary clear thermoplastic material and advanced fabrication technology for a stronger retention with a precise, comfortable fit.Per Align, Precision Bite Ramps were first introduced in 2014 and are designed to disocclude the posterior teeth or “open the bite”. This improves efficiency in deep bite Invisalign treatments. Since Precision Bite Ramps are part of Invisalign G5, its integration with Vivera Retainers is expected to bring greater clinical success for Align in the orthodontic space.With deep bite malocclusion gradually becoming a very common orthodontic occurrence worldwide, we consider this development a major breakthrough for Align with respect to customer adoption. The rate of deep bite malocclusion cases is mostly high in North America and EMEA, registering 45% of patients from those regions.According to statistics provided by Align, till date, more than 688,000 moderate or severe deep bite patients (including over 185,000 teenagers) have been treated with Invisalign clear aligners. Patient data also showed that doctors are increasingly fixing severe deep bites with Invisalign G5 Precision Bite Ramps.It is important to note that Align has recently undertaken several strategies to improve adoption of Invisalign Technology globally including product/technology development, extending clinical effectiveness, expansion of the Invisalign Technology brand and driving international growth. In a parallel press release today, the company has introduced an expanded Invisalign product portfolio offering new options and greater flexibility to a wider range of patients. Earlier, the company had introduced a clear Aligner solution for teen Class II correction — the Invisalign Technology Teen with mandibular advancement — in certain markets of Canada, EMEA and APAC. These are indicative of the growing popularity of Align’s dental products in the international market. Over the long term, we expect G6, G7 and similar innovations to act as major catalysts for Align in the new as well as the existing markets. Over the past six months, shares of Align have outperformed its industry. The stock has surged 33.1% compared with the 2.1% increase of the industry.Zacks Rank & Key PicksAlign carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). A few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Bio-Rad Laboratories (BIO  -  Free Report), athenahealth, Inc. (ATHN  -  Free Report) and Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (EW  -  Free Report).Bio-Rad Laboratories sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

824,ALGN,"In a bid to broaden its flagship Invisalign portfolio, Align Technology, Inc. (ALGN  -  Free Report) recently announced the addition of Invisalign First clear aligners for treatment of younger patients with early mixed dentition. The company plans to commercially launch the new offering for Invisalign-trained doctors in the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, and the EMEA region from Jul 1, 2018 onward.We note that, more than 600 patients have been treated with the Invisalign First clear aligners to date.Invisalign First Clear Aligners in DetailPer the company, the latest extension of Invisalign First clear aligners have been equipped with features to aid in Phase 1 treatment of younger patients with early mixed dentition (with a mixture of primary/baby and permanent teeth). Notably, Phase 1 treatment is early interceptive orthodontic treatment for young patients typically at ages between six and 10 years.Notably, the Invisalign First clear aligners have been developed to treat younger patients' malocclusions, including shorter clinical crowns, management of erupting dentition and predictable dental arch expansion.Invisalign System — A Major Growth DriverIn November 2017, Align Technology announced achieving a milestone of five million patients undergoing treatment with its InvisAlign system.Considering the fast-expanding market for clear aligner therapy, Align Technology has undertaken several strategies to drive the adoption of its core InvisAlign product line. These include product/technology development, extending clinical effectiveness, promoting the InvisAlign brand name and boosting international growth. Of late, Invisalign Technology launched an Invisalign pilot store in San Francisco that will strengthen the brand image.Moreover, we are encouraged by Align Technology’s solid Invisalign Technology prospects and growth in North America and internationally, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region.Market ProspectsPer a Markets and Markets report, children and teenagers will majorly comprise the global orthodontic market in the coming years. A large number of patients with malocclusions and jaw disorders are likely to drive the demand. Moreover, per Align Technology, up to 20% of orthodontic case starts each year can be attributed to Phase 1 treatment.Research firm Technavio anticipates the global invisible orthodontics market to witness a CAGR of approximately 13% between 2016 and 2020. Given the market potential and Align Technology’s consistent efforts, we believe that the company is well positioned to cash in on the bountiful opportunities in the market.Share Price PerformanceOver the past year, Align Technology has been outperforming its broader industry. Per the latest price movement, the company’s shares have gained 116.9% compared with the 6.9% rise of the broader industry. Zacks Rank & Other Key PicksAlign Technology carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).A few other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Bio-Rad Laboratories (BIO  -  Free Report), athenahealth, Inc.

825,ALGN,"Myriad Genetics, Inc. (MYGN  -  Free Report) recently announced the receipt of manufacturing and marketing approval for its BRACAnalysis Diagnostic System from the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare. The system can now be used as a companion diagnostic with the PARP inhibitor, Lynparza,Following the approval, physicians in Japan are now authorized to prescribe BRACAnalysis to patients diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer to find out if they carry germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutations. We encouragingly note that, BRACAnalysis is the first and only diagnostic test for a PARP inhibitor to be approved in Japan.Furthermore, Myriad Genetics has formed an exclusive partnership with the SRL Inc. to market BRACAnalysis in Japan. Notably, subsidiary of Miraca Group, SRL is one of the largest laboratory service providers in Japan.Meanwhile, AstraZeneca and Merck, the marketers of Lynparza, are looking forward to getting approval for treating patients with BRCA-mutated metastatic breast cancer in Japan.Recent Developments in BRACAnalysis Myriad Genetics has been leaving no stone unturned to boost the uptake of BRACAnalysis test. The company markets this product in the United States as BRACAnalysis CDx. In January, Myriad Genetics had announced the receipt of FDA approval for BRACAnalysis CDx test for usage as a companion diagnostic with AstraZeneca and Merck’s PARP inhibitor Lynparza (olaparib) in patients with HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer (MBC) and germline BRCA mutation.In October 2017, the company had announced the FDA’s acceptance of supplementary premarket approval (sPMA) application for BRACAnalysis CDx for usage as a companion diagnostic with AstraZeneca's PARP inhibitor Lynparza (olaparib) in patients with HER2-negative MBC.Again, last December, the company presented encouraging data from the EMBRACA trial demonstrating the BRACAnalysis CDx test’s ability to effectively identify patients with MBC who responded to Pfizer's investigational PARP inhibitor, talazoparib.Market PotentialPer Myriad Genetics, about 40,000 patients with metastatic disease are currently eligible for BRACAnalysis testing in Japan.

826,ALGN,"The Ensign Group, Inc. (ENSG  -  Free Report) has acquired the real estate and operations of Peoria Post Acute and Rehabilitation, a 128-bed skilled nursing facility located in Peoria, AZ. The buyout was effective Apr 1, 2018. An adjacent 50-bed long-term acute care hospital, operated by a third party under a lease arrangement, is also included in this facility.Details of the DealEnsign Group operates in a large and highly fragmented skilled nursing industry, which generates significant acquisition and consolidation opportunities. The field is monopolized by numerous local and regional providers.Following the acquisition, Ensign Group now owns the real estate’s 66 of 233 healthcare operations. With this purchase, the acquirer expands its portfolio to 182 skilled nursing operations consisting of 21 assisted living operations, 51 assisted and independent living operations, 22 hospice agencies, 20 home health agencies and four home care businesses across 15 states.What Management ThinksManagement stated that it is actively seeking additional opportunities to own complete stakes in real estate activities or to lease both flourishing and struggling skilled nursing, assisted living and other healthcare-related businesses across the United States.The company is also confident that aligning with its focus on becoming the top-class post-acute care provider in the market, this acquisition will facilitate it to deliver high-quality services in Arizona.Inorganic GrowthEnsign Group is always inclined towards achieving growth via inorganic means. Much of the company’s historical growth can be attributed to its expertise in buying real estate or leasing both underperforming and proficiently executing post-acute care operations. Subsequently, the company applies its core operating know-how to improve upon each acquired service, both clinically and financially.Earlier this year, Ensign Group’s assisted and independent living portfolio company, Bridgestone Living LLC, acquired the real estate and operations of two assisted living facilities in Texas. We thus expect the company to continue with its inorganic efforts going forward.Consolidation in the IndustryThe hospital industry is witnessing consolidation due to rising expenses, declining admissions, increasing bad debts and a flurry of regulatory actions. These are compelling the players to gain in scale for survival. This month, MEDNAX, Inc. (MD  -  Free Report) closed the acquisition of Pediatric Urology Practice in South Florida.Share Price PerformanceDespite all the industry headwinds, the share price reflects shareholders’ confidence in the stock. The company’s inorganic growth endeavors have significantly aided its top-line growth.

827,ALGN,"Boston Scientific Corporation (BSX  -  Free Report) recently announced the acquisition of Securus Medical Group, Inc — a privately-held developer of thermal monitoring system for the continuous measurement of esophageal temperature. The buyout is in line with the company’s strategy to gain traction in the global Electrophysiology (EP) market, which is poised to reach a value of around $4.73 billion by 2019 (per data by Markets and Markets).Securus Medical Group’s integrated catheter-based probe and imaging system produces real-time images of the temperature of the esophagus and helps in performing cardiac ablation procedure by avoiding thermal injury. Notably, this infrared esophageal temperature monitoring system has received a 510(k) clearance from the FDA.Boston Scientific plans to introduce the thermal monitoring system in the United States in the first half of 2019. Further, the company will integrate the thermal monitoring system with its RHYTHMIA HDx Mapping System improve the level of comprehensive cardiac imaging during ablation procedures.Financial Terms of the DealBoston Scientific has an existing investment in Securus Medical Group and will pay a net upfront payment of approximately $40 million in cash for the remaining stake and milestone fees of nearly $10 million.However, the transaction is not expected to be accretive to the company’s adjusted earnings per share.A Glimpse of the EP BusinessBoston Scientific’s EP business develops less-invasive medical technologies to diagnose and treat disorders of heart rate and rhythm.In fourth-quarter 2017, revenues in this division improved 20.7% year over year to $77 million (up 17.7% at CER). The upside was driven by higher uptake of the new RHYTHMIA HDx platform. Management continues to roll out the HDx platform in Europe and recently launched it in the United States as well as Japan.Overall, the company continues to expand the toolkit that supports RHYTHMIA HDx, providing ablation technologies that match the excellence of its Mapping System.Additionally, it focuses on adding tools that expand the reach and utility of RHYTHMIA HDx in different procedures.In this regard, Boston Scientific expects the full-fledged commercialization of DirectSense technology in Europe and the United States in 2018 followed by a successful initial launch in Europe.Moreover, to expand its EP business, Boston Scientific acquired Apama Medical Inc in October 2017. The company intends to integrate its RHYTHMIA HDx Mapping System with Apama RF balloon system to improve the visualization of the heart during ablation processes.Market PotentialBoston Scientific’s strategy to boost the EP business seems to be aligned with data provided by Allied Market Research.  Per the report, the global cardiac monitoring and cardiac rhythm management market is expected to reach a value of $32,216 million from 2016 to 2022, at a CAGR of 7.6%.We believe that unhealthy lifestyle and a rise in aging population will continue to result in high incidence of cardiovascular diseases.

828,ALGN,"Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (WBA  -  Free Report) is slated to release second-quarter fiscal 2018 results before the market opens on Mar 28.Last quarter, the company had delivered a positive earnings surprise of 0.79%. It is noteworthy that Walgreens Boots has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the preceding four quarters with an average positive earnings surprise of 2.43%. Let’s take a look at how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Key CatalystsOver the recent past, we have observed Walgreens Boots’ Retail Pharmacy USA division to witness comparable prescription growth and benefit from strength in retail prescription market. Several planned developments, early benefits of new pharmacy contracts as well as an increase in volume owing to previously announced pharmacy partnerships have been driving growth in this space over the past few quarters. Moreover, rising expenditure on prescription drugs and growing demand for specialty drugs have been strengthening the retail pharmacy market.Meanwhile, during first-quarter fiscal 2018, the company exceeded 1 billion scripts on a 30-day adjusted and rolling annual basis for the first time, touching a new milestone.Furthermore, the company’s efforts to boost its digital capabilities have started paying off. In this regard, more than 20% of the company’s retail refill scripts were initiated through digital channels with the Walgreens' mobile app, having been downloaded in excess of 50 million times since the launch.We are also encouraged by the increase in sales at the Retail Pharmacy International segment. Furthermore, the company has been gaining on account of the company’s strategic tie-ups, which brought more patients to its U.S. pharmacies.Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. Quote Meanwhile, strong market growth in certain emerging markets drove the company’s Pharmaceutical Wholesale division’s solid performance in the first-quarter fiscal 2018. We expect these trends to get reflected in fiscal second-quarter 2018 results, as well.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues of $31.99 billion reflects an 8.6% rise on a year-over-year basis.Also, we are upbeat about the company expanding its global footprint with its decision to acquire 40% stake in Sinopharm Holding Guoda Drugstores Co., Ltd. (GuoDa), a subsidiary of China National Accord Medicines Corporation Ltd. On completion, this investment should provide a strong impetus to Walgreens Boots’ worldwide retail pharmacy business. Notably, Shanghai-based GuoDa is a large national pharmacy chain in China. It is the retail pharmacy platform of China National Pharmaceutical Group Corporation (""CNPGC"").Moreover, the company’s acceptance of the proposal to sell part of its investment in its Chinese wholesale partner Guangzhou Pharmaceuticals Corporation for huge cash returns buoys optimism.We are also upbeat about Walgreens Boots’ plans to expand its existing group purchasing efforts with Express Scripts Holding Company, to ensure availability of specialty brand drugs. Since biosimilars have the potential to lower production costs, the move is considered to be a prudent and timely one.On the flip side, Walgreens Boots’ gross margin figures continued to contract in the last reported quarter as well. Lower pharmacy margins in the U.K., reflecting the reduction in funding, led to the downside. However, the company is working tirelessly to increase efficiency and provide high quality and cost-effective pharmacy services, in order to reduce overall pharmacy cost.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:Walgreens Boots has the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — needed for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Walgreens Boots is +2.46%.

The figure also improved from the year-ago number by 36.4%.Align Technology, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Align Technology, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Align Technology, Inc. Quote Per management, the top line was driven by a 34.2% year-over-year increase in Invisalign case shipments to 255,000 in the fourth quarter. The upside was driven by growth in North America and international regions from expanded customer base and increased utilization. Moreover, increased revenues from iTero scanner contributed to the top line.Segments in DetailRevenues at the Clear Aligner segment (86.4% of total revenues) soared 44.8% year over year to $364.2 million in the reported quarter, primarily driven by continued strong Invisalign case volume growth across all customer channels and geographical regions.In the fourth quarter, Invisalign case shipments amounted to 255,000, up 34.2% year over year, aided by growth across all regions as well as the expansion of customer base. During the quarter, Align Technology Invisalign cases were shipped to 44,985 doctors worldwide, of which 25,365 were to North America and 19,620 to international regions.Revenues from Scanner and Service (13.6%) improved a significant 37% to $57.1 million.MarginsGross margin in the quarter under review was up 40 basis points (bps) year over year to 75.5% in spite of a 41.8% rise in cost of net revenues.During the quarter, Align Technology witnessed a 39.8% year-over-year increase in selling, general and administrative expenses to $182.1 million and a 21.3% rise in research and development (R&D) expenses to $26.2 million.

Meanwhile, the current Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter 2018 EPS is 90 cents on revenues of $395.9 million. Both the estimates are falling below the projected range.Our TakeAlign Technology ended the fourth quarter on a solid note. We are upbeat about the continued strength in Invisalign volumes. While GP dentists saw higher demand in North America following the summer holidays season, orthodontists witnessed increased adult patient footfall after a busy teen season in the preceding quarter. Internationally, we are encouraged by strength in the EMEA and Asia Pacific markets.Within Scanners and Service, the company witnessed strong uptake of iTero scanners by GP dentists along with record contracts coming from the GP summit last September. Moreover, increased uptake due to the recent deal with Patterson Dental for Align’s iTero Element intraoral scanning system also contributed to the top-line. The company witnessed solid demand for the iTero scanners in EMEA and Asia Pacific as well.Align Technology has a strong cash balance that enables it to carry out share repurchases and in turn provide solid returns to investors.On the flip side, the company is exposed to foreign exchange fluctuations, seasonal demand fluctuations, higher operating expenses pertaining to increased head count along with higher investments targeted toward expansion of geographical presence and portfolio.Zacks Rank & Other Key PicksAlign Technology carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Some other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are ResMed (RMD  -  Free Report), PerkinElmer (PKI  -  Free Report) and Accuray (ARAY  -  Free Report).

831,ALGN,"On Jul 14, we issued an updated research report on Radnor, PA-based VWR Corporation  which offers laboratory products, services and solutions. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).For the last three months, VWR has been trading above the Zacks categorized Medical - Dental Supplies industry. The company’s shares have rallied 20.3%, much above the 11.4% gain of the broader Medical Dental Supplies industry over this period.Although we are currently looking forward to the company’s impending sale to ultra-high-purity materials supplier Avantor (announced back in May), the upside potential of the stock is, however, limited.The divestiture, post-closing is expected to create a major consumables-focused solutions and services provider to high-growth life sciences and advanced technologies industries. The acquisition will build on the Avantor’s strengths, including its cGMP (current good manufacturing practice) processes, significant exposure to the emerging markets and VWR’s vital position across both Americas as well as Europe.The combined company will therefore be serving a global customer base in all areas of its activities from research through production – reflecting a unique advantage in a fast growing marketplace.From shareholders’ point of view, the potential merger with Avantor seems a beneficial move at the moment. The consolidation deal has been fixed at $33.25 in cash per share of VWR common stock, representing an enterprise value of approximately $6.4 billion. The purchase price represents an approximate 17% premium to the unaffected closing stock price as on May 2, 2017, the day before the start of market speculations regarding a potential sale of VWR.The purchase price also denotes an approximate 20% premium to the 30-trading day volume weighted average price (VWAP) and an approximate 24% premium to the 90-trading day VWAP of VWR common stock as of May 2, 2017.Key PicksOther better-ranked medical stocks are Mesa Laboratories, Inc.

Excluding the contribution of revenues from acquisitions, discontinued products and the effect of currency exchange rates, organic revenues rose 4.6% year over year.The solid revenue growth in the second quarter was primarily driven by strong contribution from the company’s Specialty Surgical Solutions and Orthopedics and Tissue Technologies segments.Integra LifeSciences Holdings Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Integra LifeSciences Holdings Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Integra LifeSciences Holdings Corporation QuoteIn terms of product categories, revenues from the company's Specialty Surgical Solutions segment inched up 1.1% (down 6.5% organically) to $159.9 million.Orthopedics and Tissue Technologies’ revenues came in at $122.3 million in the second quarter, up 34.2% year over year and 23.7% organically.Margin TrendGross margin expanded 80 basis points (bps) to 64.9% in the reported quarter on lower purchase accounting adjustments from the TEI acquisition.

We are concerned about the currency headwind that is expected to affect the company’s financial performance in the rest of 2017. Also, contraction in adjusted operating margin and adjusted gross margin adds to the woes.However, the strong year-over-year increase in revenues on the back of its Orthopedics and Tissue Technologies’ segment buoys optimism.

836,ALGN,"Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings (LH  -  Free Report) or LabCorp reported second-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $2.47, up 4.7% from the year-ago quarter. The quarter’s adjusted EPS also exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.8%. On a reported basis, LabCorp’s net earnings came in at $1.82 per share, a 7.1% decline year over year.Net revenue for the second quarter increased 4.9% year over year to $2498.4 million. The quarterly revenue number also topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.47 billion.Strong growth in LabCorp Diagnostics, solid acquisition related growth as well as organic volume growth contributed to the year-over-year top-line improvement. However, this was partially offset by poor show in Covance Drug Development. Also, while adverse foreign exchange movement hampered the quarterly top-line number to the tune of 60 basis points (bps), the year-over-year comparison to a Leap Year and the timing of the Easter holiday hindered the reported quarter’s growth by 1%.Organic revenue growth (net revenue growth minus revenue from acquisitions excluding the currency impact) was 1.9%.Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings Quote Quarter Under ReviewCurrently, LabCorp reports under two operating segments: LabCorp Diagnostics and Covance Drug Development.In the reported quarter, LabCorp Diagnostics reported net revenue of $1.80 billion, up 8.4% year over year, fueled by price, mix, tuck-in acquisitions and organic volume (measured by requisitions excluding requisitions from acquisitions for the first 12 months after the close of each acquisition). The company reported 5% increase in total volume (measured by requisition) and a 3.6% increase in revenue per requisition in the quarter.Covance Drug Development reported a 3.1% drop in net revenue to $699.7 million in the second quarter. This was due to the impact of cancellation by sponsors of two large clinical studies in late 2016 — for which, Covance Drug Development used to provide central laboratory services — and a negative impact of 140 bps from foreign currency translation. At Constant Exchange Rate (CER), net revenue declined 1.7% year over year.Gross margin contracted 22 bps to 34.5% in the quarter. Adjusted operating income increased 2.2% year over year to $426.5 million. Adjusted operating margin contracted 45 bps from the year-ago quarter to 17.1% on a 6.3% rise in selling, general and administrative expenses to $435.3 million.LabCorp exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $299.9 million compared with $365 million at the end of 2016. Year-to-date operating cash flow was $544.5 million, up from $477.1 million in the year-ago period. Free cash flow came in at $403 million, up from $338.7 million in the year-ago period. During the quarter, the company returned $108 million to shareholders through share repurchases and currently has $489.5 million of authorization, remaining under its existing share repurchase plan.OutlookDespite a dull show within Covance Drug Development, the company increased its earlier provided 2017 outlook.Net revenue growth is now expected to remain in the band of 5-6.5% year over year, ahead of the earlier range of 3.5−5.5%. This includes a 10 bps impact (earlier the projection was 40 bps impact) from an unfavorable foreign exchange headwind. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $9.86 billion.Adjusted EPS guidance for 2017 has also been increased to the range of $9.30−$9.65 (previous range: $9.20−$9.60). The current Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9.42 falls within the guided range.However, free cash flow expectation remains unchanged in the band of $925−$975 million (up 3–9% from the prior year).Our TakeLabCorp posted a better-than-expected quarter with second-quarter earnings and revenues, both topping the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate. While LabCorp Diagnostics business was strong, Covance Drug Development provided dull numbers. Per the company, the impact of the cancellation by sponsors of two large clinical studies in late 2016 affected the results. This apart, an unfavorable foreign exchange continues to hamper the company’s overall results. However, an increased guidance for 2017 boosts investors’ confidence indicating chances of respite anytime soon.Nonetheless, we believe that with the integration of newer acquisitions, LabCorp is perfectly positioned to drive long-term profitable growth through a combination of world-class diagnostics, drug development expertise and knowledge services.Zacks Rank & Key PicksLabCorp currently has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

838,ALGN,"On Aug 21, we issued an updated research report on Align Technology (ALGN  -  Free Report), which manufactures and markets a system of clear aligner therapy, intra-oral scanners and CAD/CAM (computer-aided design and manufacturing) digital services used in dentistry, orthodontics and dental records storage. The stock currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Align Technology has been trading above the industry since last month. The stock has gained 4.2% in this period as compared to 7.3% decline of the industry. The company’s strong InvisAlign Technology prospects and growth in North America and international regions look encouraging.In EMEA, second-quarter 2017 volumes surged 33.2% year over year, reflecting a continued adoption of InvisAlign Technology in core markets like the U.K. and Spain as well as rapid growth from expansion in new markets including Eastern Europe, Central Europe and Benelux. During the reported quarter, volumes soared 44.4% year over year in the Asia Pacific belt, led by China and followed by SouthEast Asia, Japan and ANZ (Australia and New Zealand).Great news is that the company has recently opened a new InvisAlign Technology Treatment Planning facility in China. Plus, a multimillion dollar marketing campaign for InvisAlign Technology brand promotion is also likely to keep investors upbeat. The company’s receipt of two U.S. patents for SmartTrack Aligner material no doubt buoys optimism.On the contrary, foreign exchange headwinds continue to pose a major dampener to the company’s international performance. Also escalating costs and expenses are weighing on its margins. Last month, a comparative study of Align Technology’s forward P/E (forward 12-month basis) multiple reflected that the stock has been quite overvalued.Key PicksSome better-ranked medical stocks are Edwards Lifesciences Corp.

839,ALGN,"On Aug 21, we issued an updated research report on North Kansas City, MO-based Cerner Corporation (CERN  -  Free Report) – a leading global provider of healthcare information technology solutions (HCIT). The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).We believe that Cerner has solid growth opportunities in the revenue cycle management (RCM) suite of solutions. In fact, the segment has been a strong contributor in recent times with RevWorks services delivering a solid performance. In fact, bookings in the second quarter of 2017 were $1.636 billion (an all-time high), up 16% on a year-over-year basis.A secondary growth driver for Cerner is its Population Health (PH) Management platform. Notably, the company clinched a high number of large contracts for the PH platform in the last reported quarter.Cerner offers exposure to worldwide healthcare automation. Its international operations provide a more diversified revenue stream. In the past, the company had won contracts in the U.K. as well as the Middle East. Furthermore, Cerner constantly pursues complementary business acquisitions that enable it to expand its solutions, device offerings and services.On the flipside, the company operates in the HCIT space which is intensely competitive and fast evolving, subjecting it to rapid technological changes.Share Price & Estimate RevisionCerner had an impressive run on the bourse over the last six months, trading above the industry in terms of price performance. A glimpse at the price movement reveals that Cerner’s shares have gained 17.2%, comparing favorably with the 14.1% rise of the industry it belongs to.On the flip side, the estimate revision trend for the current year remains unfavorable with eight estimates moving south over the last two months, compared with only two movement in the opposite direction. The company’s current estimate slipped 0.4% over the past two months.Key PicksA few better-ranked medical stocks are IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. (IDXX  -  Free Report), Lantheus Holdings, Inc.

840,ALGN,"On Aug 21, we issued an updated research report on Irvine, CA-based Quality Systems Inc. (QSII  -  Free Report), a leading developer and marketer of healthcare information systems. The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Quality Systems had an unimpressive run on the bourse over the last one month, trading below the industry in terms of price performance. A glimpse at the price movement reveals that Quality Systems’ shares have lost 9.6%, comparing unfavorably with the industry’s 3.0% decline.Quality Systems posted a stellar first quarter of fiscal 2018, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate for both the counts. However, the quarter witnessed lower professional service sales, which fell almost 13.4% year over year. This was primarily because of tough comparisons with the year-earlier quarter and an unimpressive performance by the new software platform in recent quarters.We are particularly upbeat about the solid performance by the company’s total software, hardware and related segments. However, growth at the segment was partially offset by lower software license and hardware sales.Among other concerns, a sluggish global economy, intensifying competition and a strict regulatory environment are primary headwinds. Although a recurring revenue stream is a positive for Quality Systems, it mostly comes from lower margin Electronic data interchange (EDI) and Revenue Cycle Management (RCM) services.Quality Systems continues to acquire businesses that improve its revenue opportunities and aggravate integration risks. The company’s frequent acquisitions can impact its balance sheet as well as overall organic growth. This may limit Quality Systems’ expansion plans and worsen its risk profile.On a positive note, Quality Systems continues to focus on growing its presence in the RCM, population health and interoperability solution markets, which is expected to drive dividends in the coming quarters.Key PicksA few better-ranked medical stocks are IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. (IDXX  -  Free Report), Lantheus Holdings, Inc. (LNTH  -  Free Report) and Align Technology, Inc. (ALGN  -  Free Report).

Post a promising third quarter, we expect Illumina to maintain growth momentum on continued uptake of sequencing consumables, instruments and microarray offerings.We are upbeat about Illumina’s latest product launches. In the last reported quarter, growth was fueled by strong adoption of VeriSeq NIPT, a CE-IVD marked NGS solution in Europe. Moreover, the NovaSeq platform continued to drive growth with close to 200 NovaSeq systems being delivered since the launch in January 2017. Also, around 80 orders were shipped in the third quarter.In November, Illumina introduced its second FDA-regulated and CE-IVD marked next-generation sequencing (NGS) system — NextSeq 550Dx.

846,ALGN,"The Dow has come a long way since Trump’s ascension to the post of the U.S. President. The blue-chip index was lingering at 18,000 at the time of Trump’s election on Nov 8, 2016. However, the index has surged 6,000 points and notched up about 80 record highs since then. This year, the benchmark has gained nearly 24.4%.The blue-chip index’s run has been powered by strong economic growth of more than 3% for two quarters in a row till the last reported one and stupendous corporate earnings. Moreover, optimism around Trump’s tax reform promises has acted as a necessary catalyst to overall gains so far this year. We suggest you place your bet on those stocks that have surpassed the Dow’s performance this year.U.S. Economy at Its Highest Rate of GrowthAccording to the latest report from the Commerce Department, the U.S. economy improved at an impressive annual rate of 3%. This came in above the consensus estimate of 2.6%, but below the second quarter figure of 3.1%. This also marked the first time since 2014 that the U.S. economy has expanded at a 3% annual pace for two consecutive quarters.The growth rate confirms the economy’s resilience toward devastating events like the recent hurricanes. The strength largely comes from vigorous business spending on equipment, a rebound in corporate profits and solid government spending.In October, consumer confidence increased from an upwardly revised level of 126.2 to 129.5, exceeding the estimated mark of 123.9. This is the highest level since the reading of 132.6 recorded in November 2000. Consumer confidence also improved on last month’s initial reading of 125.9, which was, at the time, the highest level in 17 years.During the fifth straight month of gains, the present situations index advanced from 152 to 153.9 while the expectations index increased from 109 to 113.3. A large part of this optimism can be attributed to consumer view on the job market. The section of consumers who expect job openings to increase over the next few months increased from 18.7% to 22.6% in November. (Read More)Phenomenal Corporate EarningsCorporate earnings have been outstanding throughout 2017. Much of it can be attributed to President Trump’s promise of introducing tax cuts. Such a claim can be supported by facts, particularly, when we find that there was an 8.8% year-over-year increase in business investment during the second quarter followed by 8.6% growth in the third.Companies have been optimistic about the likelihood of a slash in corporate taxes. This optimism comes from the fact that a tax holiday would allow large-cap corporations hoarding trillions of dollars held as cash reserve overseas to bring back profits for one-time tax.Prospects of a Tax Reform Fuel Market GainsThough the Senate passed the Republican Tax Bill by a narrow margin, this victory takes Trump closer than ever to delivering on the “promise” that was the cornerstone of his campaign — a new U.S. tax code.The Bill permanently slashes the corporate tax rate to 20%.

The company has been gaining on the back of solid contributions from the GeneSight and EndoPredict tests. Management particularly expects double-digit volume growth in fiscal 2018 for GeneSight, Vectra DA, Prolaris and EndoPredict tests, all of which make up a major part of the Molecular Diagnostics portfolio.GeneSightPer the company, the GeneSight test represents significant opportunities. As GeneSight is placed in a highly under-penetrated preventive care market, the product has huge growth potential. Management expects consistent growth in GeneSight test revenues in the quarters ahead.EndoPredictAccording to Myriad Genetics, EndoPredict presents a global market opportunity of more than $600 million annually, with major demand in countries like Canada and the United States.Over the last few months, the company has been making encouraging progress with the EndoPredict test. In March, Myriad Genetics launched the EndoPredict test in the United States for patients with early-stage breast cancer. In August, the company received positive coverage decision for the test from Palmetto GBA, a Medicare Administrative Contractor (MAC) and Anthem, Inc., one of the largest private insurers in the United States. Notably, full implementation of this decision will lend Myriad Genetics coverage for approximately 90% of breast cancer patients.The company recently announced positive results from a clinical study evaluating EndoPredict which highlights its superiority over the first-generation Oncotype DX Breast Recurrence Score in predicting breast cancer recurrence in women determined to be at intermediate clinical risk by the Nottingham Prognostic Index.Notably, Myriad Genetics has been riding high on strength in the Hereditary Cancer testing space. In the last reported quarter, the company witnessed year-over-year growth in Hereditary Cancer testing volumes for the third consecutive quarter, with pricing meeting expectations.myRisk Hereditary CancerThe company believes the global market for myRisk Hereditary Cancer along with other types of hereditary cancer tests is worth roughly $5 billion annually. In December, Myriad Genetics presented favorable riskScore test data at the 2017 San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium (SABCS) in Texas.

It also announced favorable study results for its myRisk Hereditary Cancer suite.BRACAnalysis CDxThe company’s companion diagnostic program recently received a boost through the collaboration with AstraZeneca. In October 2017, the company announced FDA acceptance of supplementary premarket approval (sPMA) application for BRACAnalysis CDx’s usage as a companion diagnostic with AstraZeneca's PARP inhibitor Lynparza (olaparib) in patients with HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer. The company expects the FDA’s priority review process to be completed by third-quarter fiscal 2018. Per management, on approval, the test will be available for around 125,000 metastatic breast cancer patients.Also, Myriad Genetics submitted BRACAnalysis CDx in Japan for review by the Pharmaceutical Medical Devices Agency (PMDA) and marketing approval by Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare as a companion diagnostic to olaparib for treating HER2- metastatic breast cancer patients. Per the company, this approval will help cash in on a market opportunity of more than 10,000 patients per year.ProlarisManagement seems to be upbeat about the prospects of the Prolaris test as it represents a global market opportunity of approximately $1.5 billion annually. In May, Myriad Genetics announced the receipt of a positive final Local Coverage Determination (LCD) to expand Medicare coverage of the Prolaris test from Palmetto GBA, a Medicare Administrative Contractor (MAC).In the same month, the company announced plans of presenting data demonstrating the utility of the Prolaris test in efficiently predicting the 10-year risk of metastases in men treated for prostate cancer at the American Urological Association (AUA) 2017 Annual Meeting.

848,ALGN,"On Dec 11, we issued an updated research report on CVS Health (CVS  -  Free Report). The company carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).This leading provider of integrated services across the entire spectrum of pharmacy care has been outperforming the broader industryover the past six months. The stock has lost 10.6% compared with the industry’s 12.5% decline.We are upbeat about the company’s strong Pharmacy Services business which has been gaining on strength in Specialty Pharmacy. Management stated that the company’s specialty business is top priority for customers. Accordingly, CVS Health is poised to capitalize on this opportunity on the back of wide and differentiated offerings, which include Specialty Connect.Management expects drug price inflation, product launches, higher utilization and new PBM clients to fuel growth. We expect the Pharmacy Services segment to be a stable growth platform.  We are also impressed with CVS Health’s robust PBM (Pharmacy Benefit Management) selling season, with solid progress in the last reported quarter. While gross new business totaled $6 billion, net new business reached $2.3 billion. These figures take into account the loss of the FEP (Federal Employee Program) specialty contract but exclude the impact from individual Medicare Part D program. The company has already completed about 90% of client renewals for 2018.We are encouraged by the company’s latest announcement to buy all outstanding shares of a diversified health care benefits company — Aetna (AET  -  Free Report) — in a cash and stock deal worth approximately $207 per share or almost $69 billion (considering a rough estimate of Aetna's debt, the total transaction value is projected at $77 billion). The company expects the takeover to close in the second half of 2018, subject to approval by the company’s shareholders, regulatory bodies as well as fulfillment of certain other customary closing conditions. On the deal’s successful completion, CVS Health expects $750 million of near-term synergies, with low to mid-single digit accretion in the second year post the transaction’s closure.Additionally, the company has a strong cash balance that allows it to carry out share repurchases.On the flip side, the highly competitive retail pharmacy business is a concern. Precisely, the company faces stiff competition in the pharmacy segment. This is because availability of low-cost pharmacy options and other retail businesses continue to add pharmacy departments. Discount retailers, in particular, have made substantial inroads in gaining market share. Moreover, CVS Health has delivered sluggish numbers within the retail Long Term Care business in recent past. Per the company, the decision to restrict itself from participating in the TRICARE network and many fully-insured prime networks was due to the negative impact on Pharmacy sales and script comps.Key PicksA few better-ranked medical stocks are PetMed Express, Inc.

849,ALGN,"NuVasive, Inc. (NUVA  -  Free Report) recently entered into a definitive agreement to acquire intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring (IONM) services provider, privately-held SafePassage. Per NuVasive, the acquisition will strengthen the company's intraoperative neuromonitoring business line.Although financial terms of the deal have not been disclosed yet, the transaction is expected to close in January 2018 on fulfillment of certain customary closing conditions.Notably, New York City-basedSafePassage provides IONM and EEG services to surgeons and healthcare facilities across the eastern United States. NuVasive strongly believes that the integration of SafePassage will be highly strategic as this would help it fortify the NuVasive Clinical Services’ (NCS) position as the largest provider of outsourced IONM services (with more than 550 neurophysiologists and oversight physicians) in the United States.The consolidated giant is expected to deliver services to more than 1,000 customers and 3,000 surgeons. Currently, SafePassage's battery of 135 clinical specialists and support staff handles approximately 12,600 cases annually.Notably, NuVasive Clinical Services (“NCS”) is the nation's leading provider of intraoperative neuromonitoring services to surgeons and healthcare facilities through the combination of Impulse Monitoring and Biotronic NeuroNetwork. In July 2016, this intraoperative neuromonitoring business line was formed with the buyout of Biotronic. Ever since, this segment of the company has been growing strong. Following the acquisition of SafePassage, NCS is likely to aid more than 100,000 IONM cases per annum in the United States.This apart, the company raises optimistism with the fact that SafePassage is complementary to the current NCS geographical footprint on a limited overlap between existing healthcare accounts. This would further accelerate the growth of services from business point of view with a deeper reach in the key strategic markets. Also, this advantage will add significant new coverage, particularly in the populous New York region and the East Coast where NuVasive already has a strong spine procedural-selling presence.Financial ProspectsPost closure of the deal, the transaction is expected to be accretive to the company's adjusted earnings per share (""EPS"") in 2018 and beyond. It is also expected to support NuVasive’s long-term targets for revenue growth and expansion of its adjusted operating and EBITDA margins. Additionally, the deal’s completion is expected to meet the company's goals for return on invested capital for tuck-in acquisitions in three years.In the recent past, clinical services business has witnessed a downtrend due to decline in procedural volume. We expect this integration of SafePassage to Nuvasive’s NCS business to add capabilities to the company to rebound from this difficulty.Share Price PerformanceFor the last six months, NuVasive has been trading below the broader industry. The company has declined 25.1%, against the broader industry’s 2.4% gain.Zacks Rank & Key PicksNuVasive carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).A few better-ranked medical stocks are PetMed Express, Inc.

Apart from Welch Allyn and Trumpf, several recent noteworthy acquisitions include that of Virtus, Aspen Surgical and Mortara Instrument.We are also upbeat about this leading global medical device company’s focus on expansion through product development which is reflected in the rise in its research and development spending. In this regard, the company has been regularly launching products. The recent FDA clearance for a multi-functional operating room table, specifically designed for the IMRIS Surgical Theatre, deserves a mention. Notably, this product integrates Hill-Rom's TruSystem 7500 Surgical Table platform and IMRIS MR Neuro tabletop with the IMRIS Surgical Theatre.  In November, Hill-Rom outlined impressive long-term growth strategies along with key initiatives. The company also stated its financial goals through fiscal 2020 which buoys optimism.On the flip side, Hill-Rom operates in a highly competitive space dominated by large as well as small and regional manufacturers. Also, unfavorable currency movement continues to be a threat as a large part of the company’s revenues is generated through international operations.Key PicksA few better-ranked medical stocks are PetMed Express, Inc.

855,ALGN,"On Dec 11, we issued an updated research report on leading medical devices company Inogen Inc. (INGN  -  Free Report). The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Inogen's price movement over the past six months has been favourable. The company represented a return of almost 33.4%, better than the industry's rally of 5.2%. The current level is also higher than the S&P 500’s return of 9.3% over the same time frame.Inogen’s expanding product portfolio is a key catalyst. The company provides oxygen-concentrator solutions for portable and stationary use. Inogen’s flagship product — One G4 — is a single-solution portable oxygen concentrator (POC).Further, Inogen One G3 POC provides mobility and independence to oxygen therapy users. This platform is the lightest continuous flow oxygen concentrator in the market and consumes less power than competitive devices.Solid business-to-business sales performance is another reason for the stock's solid performance. Notably, Inogen has a market cap of $2.47 billion. The company’s direct-to-customer business model has lent it a leading position in the oxygen therapy market. The direct-to-consumer model provides companies an opportunity to build a unique brand relationship directly with customers. In an effort to drive growth in the direct-to-consumer business, the company announced that it has secured an additional facility in Cleveland, OH.Inogen, Inc Price  Inogen, Inc Price | Inogen, Inc Quote On the flip side, foreign exchange headwinds are a concern. Inogen generates a significant portion of revenues from the International market. Management expects international revenues to be lumpy, thanks to the timing and size of the distributor.  Adverse foreign currency exchange rates are likely to impede revenue growth in the near term due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Euro and other foreign currencies.In the Long-term Oxygen Therapy (LTOT) market, POC adoption continues to witness significant challenges. This is primarily due to the lack of awareness among consumers about the benefits of POC devices, higher upfront cost compared with traditional delivery model and reluctance of home equipment medical providers to support POC adoption.We believe that lack of awareness ensures higher cost related to sales & marketing that can mar profits. We believe that these headwinds related to POC adoption are major concerns that can hurt Inogen’s prospects in the long haul.Key PicksA few better-ranked medical stocks are athenahealth, Inc.

857,ALGN,"Align Technology, Inc. (ALGN  -  Free Report) reported earnings per share (EPS) of $1.01 in the third quarter of 2017, substantially up 60.3% year over year. Earnings were also higher than the company’s guided range of 78-81 cents. The figure comfortably beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 82 cents.RevenuesRevenues grew 38.3% year over year to $385.3 million in the quarter, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $360 million. This also remained well ahead of the company’s guided range of $355-$360 million.Per management, a strong top line was driven by robust Invisalign case shipments of 32.8% year over year to 236.1 thousand during the third quarter. This upside was backed by growth in North America and international regions. Also a 46.3% year-over-year surge in teenage cases across the board, reflecting a very strong summer teen season, contributed to the top-line growth.Segments in DetailRevenues at the Clear Aligner segment (88.7% of total revenue) soared 40.2% year over year to $341.6 million in the reported quarter, primarily driven by continued strong Invisalign case volume growth across all customer channels and geographical regions.In the third quarter, Invisalign case shipments amounted to 236,065, up 32.8% year over year, aided by growth across all regions as well as the expansion of customer base. During the quarter, Align Technology Invisalign cases were shipped to 42,605 doctors worldwide, of which, 24,845 were from North America while 17,760 were from international regions.Revenues from Scanner and Service (11.3%) improved significantly by 25% to $43.7 million.MarginsGross margin in the third quarter was up 82 basis points (bps) year over year to 75.9% on a 33.7% rise in cost of net revenue.During the quarter, Align Technology witnessed a 33.8% year-over-year increase in selling, general and administrative expenses to $169.5 million and an 18.5% rise in research and development (R&D) expenses to $24.2 million. The operating margin, however, expanded 335 bps to 25.6%.Financial DetailsAlign Technology exited the third quarter with cash and cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities of $679.1 million, which marked a 12.8% rise from the preceding quarter.In the reported quarter, Align Technology closed its earlier-announced $50 million accelerated stock repurchase program (ASR) receiving a total of 0.4 million shares at a weighted average share price of $146.48. Management currently has $250 million available for repurchase under the existing stock repurchase authorization.GuidanceFor the fourth quarter of 2017, the company projects EPS of 92-95 cents on revenues of $391-$398 million. The company also expects Invisalign case shipments in the band of 245,000- 250,000, up 29-32% over the same period a year ago.Our TakeAlign Technology ended the third quarter on a solid note with both earnings and revenues beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate. We are upbeat about the continued strong Invisalign volumes. An extremely strong summer teen season drove the company’s Invisalign growth within the global teen market.Within Scanners and Service, the company witnessed a nice uptake of iTero scanners by GP dentists. With record contracts coming from the GP summit last September, the company expects this bullish trend to continue for the rest of 2017. Align is also looking forward to its recently-inked distribution agreement with Patterson Dental for Align’s iTero Element intraoral scanning system.Additionally, the company has a strong cash balance that enables it to carry out share repurchase programs and in turn provide solid returns to its investors.On the flip side, the company is exposed to foreign exchange fluctuations, seasonal demand fluctuations, higher operating expenses pertaining to an increased head count along with higher investments targeted toward growth acceleration in geographical expansion and portfolio extension.Zacks Rank & Key PicksCurrently, Align Technology carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are PetMed Express, Inc.

858,ALGN,"The latest Earnings Preview depicts a bullish run in the ongoing reporting cycle. Till Oct 20, 87 S&P 500 members (24.7% of the total market cap) reported their numbers. Total earnings for these members have gone up 9.4% on 7.3% higher revenues.However, investors are concerned about the Medical sector (one of the 16 Zacks sectors) that saw a lot of struggle during the first nine months of the year, thanks to the political change and the ongoing policy-restructuring related battle.The ensuing lack of visibility has roiled the favorable trend that this sector maintained in the trailing few quarters. For the third quarter, the expected earnings growth rate stands at a mere 2.2% on a 4.8% revenue-growth projection. In comparison, the second-quarter earnings growth was quite impressive at 7% on 4.4% revenue growth.What’s in Store for the Medical Product Space?While twists and turns continue to unfold at Capitol Hill, the scenario within the Medical - Products space, an important part of the medical device subcategory within the broader Medical sector, is getting gloomier. The latest executive order released by the Republicans points to a shrinking customer base, indicating a cut in demand for expensive medical procedures and devices. This may lead to major supply/demand disequilibrium within this space.However, major medical device players have been pinning hopes on the abolition of the infamous 2.3% medical device sales tax, though its elimination is far from reality.Considering these tax issues, investors interested in the Medical Product space eagerly await earnings reports of MedTech bigwigs throughout this week. Let’s take a look at the major Medical products stocks slated to release their quarterly reports on Oct 26:Per our quantitative model, when stocks with a solid Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) are combined with a positive Earnings ESP, then chances of beating estimates are always high.

The company while gaining a fair share in a few cardiovascular segments and DES (Drug Eluting Stent), continues to build momentum worldwide.However, ahead of this earnings release, the quarter’s IC business is likely to be grossly impacted by the company’s product recall issue within Europe. While the downbeat IC business tangled under product recall issue will possibly gain some boost from the company’s recent $435 million acquisition of Switzerland-based Symetis SA, a full recovery may take time. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter IC revenues is currently pegged at $580 million, lower than the sequentially last quarter’s reported number of $603 million.Boston Scientific Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Boston Scientific Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Boston Scientific Corporation Quote Notably, the company’s earnings have outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 0.84% in the trailing four quarters.

The company’s revenues in the domestic domain were driven by solid growth in devices as well as low double-digit software sales growth in the previous quarter. Internationally, the company’s receipt of French reimbursement approval for telemonitoring buoys optimism.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for domestic revenues (including the contributions from Brightree) of $334 million reflects an increase of 10.9% from the year-ago quarter.

859,ALGN,"Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. (ZBH  -  Free Report) is expected to beat earnings when it reports third-quarter 2017 results on Nov 1, before the opening bell.Last quarter, the company’s earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.95%. However, it reported an average beat of 0.36% for two of the trailing four quarters. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Key CatalystsSimilar to the prior quarter, the company is expected to gain from strength in the S.E.T. (Surgical, Sports Medicine, Foot and Ankle, Extremities and Trauma) arm. Revenues at S.E.T. were driven by surgical business and sports medicine offerings such as Gel-One, Subchondroplasty and Quattro Link in the last reported quarter. Moreover, solid uptake of the A.L.P.S. Plating System within the foot and ankle portfolio boosted the segment’s performance.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for S.E.T. revenues of $411 million reflects an increase of 2.2% from the year-ago quarter. Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise   Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. Quote We are also upbeat about the Spine, Craniomaxillofacial and Thoracic (Spine & CMF) segment, which is expected to deliver another quarter of promising performance. Under the spine category, Zimmer Biomet should continue to gain from strong uptake of Mobi-C Cervical Disc. Moreover, though at the initial phase of integration, the LDR Holdings acquisition is expected to contribute approximately 30 basis points to the company’s top line in the to-be-reported quarter. Also, management is hopeful of gaining from significant cross-selling opportunities that the LDR acquisition provides on the back of integrated spine sales force in the United States.Also, continued solid uptake of SternaLock Blu and SternaLock 360 primary closure systems as well as the RibFix Blu Thoracic Fixation System within craniomaxillofacial and thoracic arm buoys optimism.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Spine & CMF revenues of $188 million indicates a rise of 2.2% from the year-ago quarter.Here are the other factors that might influence Zimmer Biomet’s third-quarter results:Looking at the focused execution of Zimmer Biomet’s sales teams, we expect the global adoption rate of the company’s flagship personalized knee system — Persona — to be impressive. In this regard, in September, the company announced the launch of the Persona Partial Knee System. This is the latest addition to its portfolio of personalized and anatomically designed knee implant systems. Also, in June, Zimmer Biomet announced the release of its X-ray-based Patient Specific Instrument, X-PSI Knee System. This is the world's first CE-Marked surgical planning system that allows for patient-specific implant positioning, solely utilizing X-ray technology. These developments are expected to boost the top line in the third quarter.Emerging markets have always been a significant revenue generating source for Zimmer Biomet. Despite the recent economic downturn which affected Zimmer Biomet’s business in Latin America, the company managed to drive growth through its operations in other parts of the emerging market, especially the Asia-Pacific and EMEA (Europe, the Middle East and Africa). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter revenues from EMEA of $379 million indicates an improvement of 2.7% from the year-ago quarter.Overall, Zimmer Biomet expects third-quarter revenues in the range of $1.815-$1.845 billion, reflecting a negative impact from foreign exchange of 0.5%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter total revenues is pegged at $1.83 billion.However, factors like macroeconomic uncertainties and unfavorable currency fluctuations have been adversely denting Zimmer Biomet’s sales over the past few quarters. Moreover, the company has also been dealing with pricing pressure issue. In this regard, Zimmer Biomet faced a negative pricing pressure of approximately 2.6% in the second-quarter. Thus, in absence of any favorable changes in this line, the company may continue to face these headwinds in the to-be-reported quarter as well.Meanwhile, for the second half of 2017, management continues to expect the adverse impact from reduced sales expectations, continued spending in critical programs and rising manufacturing costs from Warsaw North Campus facility to persist.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:Zimmer Biomet does not have the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — needed for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Zimmer Biomet is -0.38%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Zimmer Biomet carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of a positive earnings surprise.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of $1.75 reflects a 2.2% decline on a year-over-year basis.Stocks Worth a LookHere are a few medical stocks worth considering as they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.The Cooper Companies, Inc. (COO  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.43% and a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.

Encouragingly, Henry Schein’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all of the past four quarters, at an average of 2.8%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Henry Schein is likely to beat earnings because it has the perfect combination of two key ingredients.Zacks ESP:  Henry Schein has an Earnings ESP of +1.23% as the Most Accurate estimate is 91 cents, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is lower at 90 cents.

We expect a similar trend in the third quarter as well.The company’s strategy to expand digital dentistry globally is also encouraging. We are also upbeat about management’s expectations to witness at least low single-digit growth in North America’s dental consumable merchandise market in the second half of 2017. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter total revenues of $3.049 billion reflects an increase of 6.4% from the year-ago quarter.The company is currently banking on digital dentistry, which is part of its strategic plan. Henry Schein is busy promoting digital workflows for general dentistry as well as dental specialties. Beginning Sep 1, 2017, the company started selling the full range of Dentsply Sirona dental equipment across North America, including the leading CEREC CAD/CAM restoration system. This is expected to boost the top line to some extent.Notably, during the second quarter, Henry Schein Animal Health opened a new National Distribution Service Center (NDSC) in Columbus’s Brookhollow neighborhood. This has helped the company operate as a complete solution provider for veterinary practices across the country. We expect this to boost the top line in the yet-to-be-reported quarter.On the flip side, Henry Schein’s disappointing gross and operating margins over the past few quarters due to higher cost of sales and expenses is a matter of concern.This apart, currency fluctuations and a tough competitive landscape add to the woes. Also, the entry of group purchasing organizations (GPOs) in the United States has intensified competition.Overall, Henry Schein expects 2017 EPS in the range of $7.17-$7.30, reflecting 8-10% growth from the 2016 EPS figure of $6.61.Stocks Worth a LookHere are a few medical stocks worth considering as they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.The Cooper Companies, Inc.

861,ALGN,"Penumbra, Inc. (PEN  -  Free Report) is expected to report third-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Nov 11. The company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 7.6% for three of the trailing four quarters. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.CatalystsOver the past few quarters, Penumbra showcased strong top-line performance on consistent growth in its neuro and peripheral vascular arms. The company is presently focusing on driving innovation, product development and geographic expansion. This is expected to help Penumbra maintain the bullish growth trend in the to-be-reported quarter.It is to be noted that neuro growth was mainly driven by sales of the Penumbra system for ischemic stroke. The company witnessed increased sequential growth on higher procedural volumes. However, the company expects to see seasonality in the neuro business in the third quarter.Also, peripheral vascular growth was driven by the Indigo family and peripheral thrombectomy along with the Coil portfolio in peripheral embolization.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for neuro revenues of $54 million reflects an increase of 13.6% from the year-ago-quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for peripheral vascular revenues of $24.6 million shows a rise of 25.2% from the year-earlier quarter.Penumbra, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Penumbra, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Penumbra, Inc. Quote Overall, fiscal third-quarter total revenues are projected at $79 million, up 17.9% from the prior-year quarter.Here are the other factors that might influence Penumbra’s third-quarter results:Penumbra has been delivering strong performance in both domestic and international markets on the back of solid contributions from its neuro business. We expect the trend to continue in the yet-to-be-reported quarter.In second-quarter 2017, gross margin deteriorated and operating expenses increased. According to the company, increased compensation expenses related to growth in headcount and higher clinical trial expenses resulted in operating loss in the quarter. We expect escalating costs and expenses to continue to keep margins under pressure in the third quarter.Meanwhile, research and development expenses increased 29.2% in the second quarter. With the company remaining focused on product launches, we expect expenses to remain high in the third quarter.Further, foreign exchange fluctuations and stiff competition from major commercial laboratories and hospitals continue to raise caution.Overall, the company expects revenues to decline sequentially in the third quarter owing to seasonality in summer. The company expects to report revenues in the band of $312-$317 million.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:Penumbra has the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP  and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.

862,ALGN,"We expect IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. (IDXX  -  Free Report) to beat expectations when it reports third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 31, before the opening bell. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 11.8%. It is worth noting that IDEXX has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the preceding four quarters, at an average of 9.3%. Let’s take a look at how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Key CatalystSimilar to the prior quarter, IDEXX is expected to gain from strong global growth in Companion Animal Group (CAG) Diagnostics recurring revenues. The growth in CAG Diagnostics was led by double-digit organic revenue gains across consumable, reference lab and rapid assay revenues, as well as continued expansion of IDEXX's premium instrument installed base.We are upbeat about the 300% year-over-year rise in the uptake of SNAP Pro units in North America last quarter. Management expects the solid performance to continue in the to-be-reported quarter as well.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for CAG Diagnostics revenues of $426 million reflects an increase of 10.6% from the year-ago quarter.Here are the other factors that might influence IDEXX’s third-quarter results:IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise   IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. QuoteIDEXX expects its Livestock, Poultry and Dairy (LPD) business to witness flat-to-modest growth in the second half of 2017. The segment has been seeing continued strength in China. Also, expansion of the recurring pregnancy testing franchise buoys optimism. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the LPD business of $30.3 million for the third quarter reflects an increase of 1.7% from the year-ago quarter.The company continues to expand globally. It has been significantly benefitting from the bountiful opportunities in the companion animal market of emerging nations. Further, management’s consistent share buybacks reflect its strong free cash flow reserve. We believe the outcome of these endeavors will be reflected in the company’s third-quarter performance.Encouraged by these factors, IDEXX expects 2017 revenue in the range of $1,945-$1,965 million, reflecting organic revenue growth expectations between 10% and 11%. The Zacks Consensus Estimates for third-quarter total revenues are projected at $494 million, up 10.3% from the prior-year quarterManagement also estimates its 2017 EPS guidance to the band of $3.12-$3.22 per share, supported by continued operating margin expansion aligned with its long-term goals. The outlook represents EPS growth of 28-32% on a reported basis. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of $3.17 reflects an increase of 29.9% from the year-ago quarter.Moreover, management is upbeat about the 12% rise in the sales force in the U.S. market and some other areas in the third quarter.On the flip side, foreign currency fluctuation is a major headwind. Another concern for the company is its high reliance on third-party distributors. The purchasing dynamics of distributors have a significant impact on the company’s sales of instrument consumables and rapid assay products. Also, the company is exposed to higher operating expenses pertaining to increased head count along with higher investments targeted toward portfolio development and geographic expansion in the United States and internationally.Also, the competitive landscape in the domestic and overseas markets weighs on IDEXX’s performance. The struggle to gain market traction might prove to be a drag on third-quarter 2017 results.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:IDEXX does not have the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — needed for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for IDEXX is 0.00%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: IDEXX carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of a positive earnings surprise.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of 75 cents reflects a 20.9% improvement on a year-over-year basis.Stocks Worth a LookHere are a few medical stocks worth considering as they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.The Cooper Companies, Inc.

864,ALGN,"We expect Align Technology, Inc. (ALGN  -  Free Report) to beat expectations when it reports third-quarter 2017 earnings on Oct 26, after market close.Last quarter, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 16.44%. Align Technology has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the preceding four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 16.71%. Let’s take a look at how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Align Technology is likely to beat earnings because it has the perfect combination of two key ingredients.Zacks ESP:  Align Technology has an Earnings ESP of +1.24% as the Most Accurate estimate is 85 cents while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 73 cents. A favorable Zacks ESP serves as a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Align Technology currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings estimates.Conversely, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.The combination of Align Technology’s Zacks Rank #3 and +1.24% ESP makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Align Technology, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise   Align Technology, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Align Technology, Inc. QuoteWhat’s Driving the Better-Than-Expected Earnings?We are upbeat about Align Technology’s strategic initiatives like international expansion, ensuring Invisalign treatment for a growing base of patients. Also, we are upbeat about the international teen case growing 40.5% year over year in the last reported quarter, reflecting growing demand. In the quarter, the company reached a new benchmark of 1 million teen patients who had adopted the Invisalign treatment.Management anticipates consistent growth in the Asia-Pacific region. In a bid to grow in this region, the company opened new Invisalign Treatment Planning Facility in China.We are upbeat about management’s expectations of continued strong performance in international markets in the to-be-reported quarter. Invisalign volumes are likely to grow sequentially, reflecting continued strong growth in APAC. However, summer holidays in EMEA may partially mar the performance.Notably, to expand its Invisalign brand, Align Technology introduced a patient-friendly solution – Invisalign Teen with mandibular advancement – for teens in certain markets of Canada, EMEA and APAC in March. According to the company, this advancement will help it offer more options for teen treatment which might boost its top line in the yet-to-be reported quarter. In May, the company announced the receipt of two U.S. patents for Align Technology’s SmartTrack aligner material that is exclusively used for Invisalign aligner treatment.Recently, the company expanded work flow options of its leading iTero scanners.  In this context, Align Technology recently signed a distribution agreement with Patterson Dental, a business unit of Patterson Companies, Inc. (PDCO  -  Free Report). Per the non-exclusive agreement, effective September 2017, Align Technology’s iTero Element intraoral scanning system will be available as part of Patterson Dental’s CAD/CAM portfolio in the United States and Canada. This latest development should boost the iTero scanner customer base starting from the third quarter itself.Moreover, the company saw increased adoption of iTero scanners for Invisalign case submissions instead of PVS impressions especially in North America, thereby driving Invisalign utilization. Management expects this bullish trend to continue in the yet-to-be reported quarter.Notably, for the third quarter of 2017, the company projects EPS of 78-81 cents on revenues of $355-$360 million. The company also expects Invisalign case shipments in the band of 231,000 to 234,000, up 27-29% over the same period a year ago.On the flip side, unfavorable foreign currency might affect the company’s revenues in the to-be-reported quarter. Also, the company is exposed to seasonal demand fluctuations, higher operating expenses pertaining to increased head count along with higher investments targeted toward growth acceleration through geographical expansion and portfolio expansion.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few other medical stocks worth considering as they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.The Cooper Companies, Inc.

865,ALGN,"Varian Medical Systems Inc. (VAR  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 earnings on Oct 25, after the market closes.Last quarter, the company delivered earnings of $1.04 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 95 cents. However, adjusted earnings declined from $1.22 in the year-ago period.Factors at PlayWe are upbeat about Varian Medical’s oncology business that accounted for around 95% of the company’s total revenue in fourth-quarter 2017. Notably, the company has been addressing both the tier 1 and mid-tier markets through its Edge, Truebeam and VitalBeam products and has also been winning international contracts in the oncology space. For the fourth quarter of 2017, Varian expects adjusted earnings per share in the range of $1.15-$1.23. Revenues are expected to increase about 3% on a year-over-year basis.The company recently launched its FDA-approved product Halcyon, to strengthen foothold in the oncology business. Varian Medical also signed an agreement with Vijametech and UPMC to establish radiation oncology centers in Vietnam. We are also upbeat about Varian’s prospects internationally, where it primarily banks on proton therapy as an advanced treatment option for cancer patients. In this regard, we note that Varian Medical recently received Shonin approval in Japan to market the ProBeam system for proton therapy.Varian Medical recently entered into two international agreements concerning its Proton therapy platform. Bangkok-based King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital has selected its ProBeam Compact single-room proton therapy system for cancer treatment in Thailand along with Delray Medical Center in Florida.We believe Western Europe, China and Africa present significant top-line growth opportunities in the near term. The company is opening offices in Africa and the Middle East, which depicts that it is aware of opportunities in the region. Moreover, Varian Medical’s strong product pipeline is a key catalyst.Nevertheless, increasing local competition is a primary headwind. Unfavorable foreign currency might affect the company’s revenues in the to-be-reported quarter. Also, the company is exposed to seasonal demand fluctuations and higher operating expenses pertaining to increased investments targeted toward growth acceleration in geographical expansion and portfolio expansion.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show earnings beat for Varian Medical this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

For the third quarter, Baxter anticipates sales growth of about 4% at constant currency. Adjusted earnings per share are forecasted in the range of 58-60 cents versus the year-ago figure of 56 cents. Also, for full-year 2017, the company projects earnings in the band of $2.34 to $2.40 per share (from continuing operations, before special items), up from full-year 2016 earnings of $1.95. Of late, Baxter International has accelerated pace of acquisitions and strategic collaborations to enhance its product portfolio, thereby opening up significant long-term opportunities. Also, several recent FDA approvals are likely to drive growth in the yet-to-be-reported third quarter of 2017.The company’s estimate revision trend is also encouraging. For the current year, Baxter International witnessed two upward estimate revisions with no movement in the opposite direction over the last one month.However, lower cyclophosphamide sales pose a threat to the company’s Integrated Pharmacy Solutions franchise. For the third quarter, a decline in cyclophosphamide sales is expected to impact top line by low-single digits. Also, the foray of group purchasing organizations (GPOs) in the United States intensifies competition for the company.Earnings WhispersOur quantitative model doesn’t point to an earnings beat this quarter.

867,ALGN,"Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (WBA  -  Free Report) is slated to release fourth-quarter and full-year fiscal 2017 results before the market opens on Oct 25.Last quarter, the company had posted a positive earnings surprise of 1.53%. It is worth noting that Walgreens has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the preceding four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 2.63%. Let’s take a look at how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayWalgreens Boots' Retail Pharmacy USA division continued to witness comparable prescription growth as well as strength in retail prescription market in the last reported quarter. Notably, in the fiscal second quarter, the Retail Pharmacy USA division saw the highest comparable prescription growth in more than seven years.Several planned developments, early benefits of new pharmacy contracts and volume increase from previously announced strategic pharmacy partnerships have been driving growth in this space over the past few quarters. We expect this growth momentum to continue in the fiscal fourth quarter as well.Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. QuoteBased on a promising performance in the preceding quarter, Walgreens Boots raised the low end of its guidance for fiscal 2017 by 8 cents and currently expects full-year adjusted earnings in the range of $4.98 to $5.08. Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal fourth-quarter earnings of $1.22 reflects a 14% improvement on a year-over-year basis. Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal fourth-quarter revenues of $30.09 billion reflects a 5.1% improvement on a year-over-year basis.However, the sales performance of the Retail Pharmacy international division continued to disappoint. The reduction in government pharmacy funding in the U.K. has been affecting performance. In absence of any near-term catalyst, we expect the scenario to persist in the upcoming quarter as well.We also note that slowdown in generic introduction has been affecting Walgreens Boots' margins. Of late, increased reimbursement pressures as well as generic drug cost inflation have been denting margins. In the third quarter of 2017, Walgreens Boots' gross margin contracted on account of reimbursement pressure and price inflation of branded drugs.Management continues to witness lower profitability in Boots UK comparable pharmacy's gross profit due to lower margin products. Although the company is working to boost efficiency and provide high-quality, cost-effective pharmacy services, the near-term outlook remains bleak.Meanwhile, market growth is expected to be strong in certain emerging markets backed by the timing of price increase. Also, in order to expand its footprint in Asia, the company launched its first Boots franchise store in South Korea in April 2017. This development is expected to boost the top line in the fiscal fourth quarter.In September 2017, Walgreens Boots announced the receipt of U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) approval for the purchase of 1,932 stores, three distribution centers and related inventory from Rite Aid for a total value of $4.375 billion. Post the new transaction’s initial closing, synergies of $300 million are expected to be entirely realized within four years of its initial completion. Per Walgreens Boots, this modified merger contract will extend its growth strategy and offer additional operational benefits. It will help the company expand and optimize retail pharmacy network in key U.S. markets, including the Northeast.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:Walgreens Bootsdoes not have the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — needed for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP forWalgreens Boots is -0.44%.

868,ALGN,"Illumina, Inc. (ILMN  -  Free Report) is slated to report third-quarter fiscal 2017 results, after markets close on Oct 24. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 20.6% with average earnings beat of 9.3% in three of the trailing four quarters. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Key CatalystsSimilar to the prior quarter, Illumina is expected to gain from strong performance in Product revenues as well as Service and other revenue segments. Over the last few quarters, the company’s product revenues increased primarily onrising sequencing consumable revenues. Total Service and other revenues are demonstrating strong growth led by continued demand for NextSeq from NIPT customers and partners. We expect these factors to drive the yet-to-be reported quarter’s performance as well.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Product revenues of $579 million reflects an increase of 12.6% from the year-ago quarter. Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Service and other revenues of $116 million indicates a rise of 24.7% from the year-ago quarter.Overall, third-quarter 2017 total revenues are projected at $694 million, up 14.3% from the prior-year quarter. Illumina, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Illumina, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Illumina, Inc. Quote Here are the other factors that might influence Illumina’s third-quarter results:Illumina earlier announced that its FDA-approved next-generation sequencing (NGS) -- Extended RAS Panel has met the Current Colorectal Cancer Guidelines. This new kit fulfills the most up-to-date guidance for RAS testing to determine eligibility of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors in metastatic colorectal cancer. Management expected the shipment of this kit to start in the third quarter of 2017. Hence, we expect this to drive the top line.In the second quarter, Illumina witnessed 12% growth in the Asia-Pacific region, propelled by 16% rise in China. Among the emerging markets, China currently offers the most favorable space for Illumina’s business growth. In recent times, management has noticed a considerable rise in demand from customers looking to set up NIPT operations in China. With China currently being the fourth largest developing nation (in terms of nominal GDP), we believe the progress in the country will open up channels for Illumina, thereby driving its top line in the yet-to-be reported quarter.Also, encouraged by the solid second-quarter performance, Illumina has raised its full-year 2017 revenue growth expectations to 12% from the earlier provided range of 10-12%. On the flip side, a tough competitive landscape may pose a challenge for the company. We are also apprehensive about issues pertaining to NIH funding which Illumina has been facing for quite some time now.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:Illumina does not have the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Illumina is -0.93%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Illumina carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of a positive earnings surprise.Nonetheless, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of 98 cents reflects a 1% improvement on a year-over-year basis.Stocks Worth a LookHere are a few medical stocks worth considering as they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Abbott (ABT  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.17% and a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Align Technology, Inc. (ALGN  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +2.06% and a Zacks Rank #3.Henry Schein, Inc. (HSIC  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.33% and a Zacks Rank #3.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

869,ALGN,"Following today's closing bell, we see fresh quarterly earnings results from a host of new companies. As we've seen thus far in Q4 earnings season, results are generally better than expected, in some instances much more so.For instance, Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy)-rated Shutterfly (SFLY  -  Free Report) is up 15% in after-hours trading following its big earnings beat reported this afternoon: $3.37 per share ($3.11 allowing for the one-time tax charge) on $593.8 million in revenues easily zipped past the $2.91 per share and $557 million, respectively. This is the 4th straight earnings beat for the photo services company, and its 15% positive surprise in the quarter is improved on the trailing 4-quarter average surprise of +10.35%.Align Technologies (ALGN  -  Free Report) was also up big upon its initial posting of its quarterly results, which showed a 10-cent beat to $1.06 per share on $421.3 million in sales, which was well above the $395.5 million expected. This revenue actual also represents a year-over-year gain of 43.7%, with operating income in the quarter up 60% and Invisalign case shipments up 8% sequentially, 34% year over year.Advanced Micro Devices (AMD  -  Free Report) also beat on top- and bottom-lines this afternoon, posting 8 cents per share and $1.48 billion in revenues which outpaced the 5 cents and $1.40 billion expected. The Silicon Valley semiconductor firm took a one-time tax credit of $18 million for the quarter, and guidance was up big to $1.55 billion in revenues compared to $1,25 analysts had been looking for.

Those gains, however, came with serious volatility and risk.

870,ALGN,"The fourth-quarter earnings season has commenced on a positive note for most sectors, with a decent picture from the 133 S&P 500 participants that have reported till Jan 26. Total earnings for these companies are up 12.3% year over year on 8.8% higher revenues, with 81.2% beating earnings estimates and 78.9% surpassing top-line expectations.Notably, about 121 S&P 500 companies are reporting their earnings this week.Per the latest Earnings Preview, overall earnings for the fourth quarter are expected to increase 11.6% on 7.5% growth in revenues. This indicates an improved growth projection from the previous quarter driven by a corporate-tax overhaul and relatively healthy job data. These factors have boosted corporate earnings and stoked investments.Based on this pattern, the fourth quarter is expected to register modest double-digit percentage earnings growth on a year-over-year basis.MedTech Earnings So FarMedical, one among the 16 Zacks sectors, is expected to stand out this quarter. The sector benefits from favorable consumer behavior, growing prevalence of minimally-invasive surgeries, demand for liquid biopsy tests, use of IT for ensuring quick and improved patient care along with the shift of the payment system to a value-based model.This is evident from the results of MedTech heavyweights Abbott (ABT  -  Free Report) and Intuitive Surgical (ISRG  -  Free Report). The companies exited the fourth quarter on a solid note, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both counts. An upbeat FY18 guidance also instills confidence.For the fourth quarter, the earnings growth rate for the medical sector is pegged at 4.2% on 4.9% revenue growth.Upcoming ReleasesLet’s take a look at three major other MedTech stocks slated to release their quarterly reports on Jan 30, 2018:Stryker Corporation’s (SYK  -  Free Report) results are scheduled for release after the market closes. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $3.46 billion, up 9.5% year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earnings is $1.95, up 9.6% on a year-over-year basis.Stryker recently announced better-than-expected preliminary net sales results for fourth-quarter 2017. For full-year 2017, net sales are estimated at $12.4 billion, up 9.8% from the year-ago quarter on a constant-currency basis. The figure beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $12.38 billion.Buoyed by these prospects, our quantitative model indicates an earnings beat for Stryker this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat estimates. Stryker’s Earnings ESP is +0.01%.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earnings is projected at $2.10, down 1.9% on a year-over-year basis.Despite solid prospects in the company’s S.E.T. (Surgical, Sports Medicine, Foot and Ankle, Extremities and Trauma) arm, macroeconomic uncertainties and unfavorable currency fluctuations have been denting sales over the past few quarters.The company has been dealing with pricing pressure. In this regard, Zimmer Biomet witnessed negative pricing pressure of approximately 2.1% last quarter. In the absence of any favorable changes on these lines, these headwinds might reflect in the company’s fourth-quarter results (read more: Will S.E.T.

871,ALGN,"On Dec 7, we issued an updated research report on Mountain View, CA-based Omnicell Inc. (OMCL  -  Free Report). The stock has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Over the last three months, Omnicell’s shares have been slightly above the broader industry. The stock has gained 0.2% versus the broader industry’s gain of 0.1%.Omnicell, Inc. Price Omnicell, Inc. Price | Omnicell, Inc. QuoteOmnicell exited third-quarter 2017 on a mixed note with earnings beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate and revenues missing the same. Also, a weak gross margin scenario is a matter of concern. We believe the company’s strategies including portfolio expansion, acquisitions and penetration into the medication adherence market to continue driving expenses. Meanwhile, costs related to the recently launched XT series have been exerting pressure on the bottom line.Omnicell’s lowering of the upper end of the 2017 adjusted revenue guidance is reflective of the fact that the overall slump will stay to bother. A tough competitive landscape also acts as a dampener.On a positive note, the year-over-year increase in earnings and revenues was impressive. The company witnessed balanced growth across all business lines in the quarter. We are also encouraged the company’s efforts on product innovation through Research and Development (R&D). Omnicell has of late been observed to gain consistently from a series of product launches (the latest being XT Series Automated Supply Dispensing system) and strategic partnerships.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked medical stocks are PetMed Express, Inc.

872,ALGN,"Myriad Genetics, Inc. (MYGN  -  Free Report) presented encouraging data from two studies on its second-generation prognostic gene expression test for breast cancer — EndoPredict. The results were presented at the 2017 San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium (SABCS) in Texas.Per the company, the data from these studies demonstrated the test’s ability to predict residual cancer burden to neoadjuvant chemotherapy and to neuroendocrine therapy in HR+/HER2- breast cancer patients from ABCSG34. The results also confirmed EndoPredict’s ability to effectively predict the distant recurrence in patients with invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) compared to those with invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC). We believe these findings will drive the uptake of EndoPredict.Developments in EndoPredict TestsMyriad Genetics has been gaining from strong Molecular Diagnostics performance led by solid contributions from the GeneSight and EndoPredict tests. We are also upbeat about management’s expectations of double-digit volume growth in fiscal 2018 for GeneSight, Vectra DA, Prolaris and EndoPredict tests, all of which make up a major part of the Molecular Diagnostics portfolio.In March, the company has been receiving encouraging response since the launch of the EndoPredict test in the United States for early-stage breast cancer. In August, Myriad Genetics received positive coverage decision for the test from Palmetto GBA, a Medicare Administrative Contractor (MAC) and Anthem, Inc., one of the largest private insurers in the United States. Notably, full implementation of this decision will lend Myriad Genetics coverage for approximately 90% of breast cancer patients.The company recently announced positive results from a clinical study evaluating EndoPredict which highlights its superiority over the first-generation Oncotype DX Breast Recurrence Score in predicting breast cancer recurrence in patients determined to be at intermediate clinical risk by the Nottingham Prognostic Index.Market PotentialPer a report by DPI Research on Medium, the breast cancer screening market in the United States is expected to reach a value of roughly $5.8 billion by 2022. Moreover, per an article by BreastCancer.Org, approximately 252,710 new cases of invasive breast cancer in women are likely to be diagnosed in the United States in 2017. They also project 63,410 new cases of non-invasive (in situ) breast cancer this year as well.We believe an ageing population, rising awareness and expenditure in healthcare will continue to drive growth in the breast cancer screening market. However, this market is dominated by a number of well-established players, Quest Diagnostics (DGX  -  Free Report) being the most prominent one. In this space, Quest Diagnostics’ Quest Vantage services help in the discovery of genetic variants related to the hereditary risk of 15 types of cancer, including breast, colorectal, pancreatic and renal.Share Price PerformanceMyriad Genetics has been gaining investor confidence on consistently positive results. Over the past year, the company’s share price has outperformed the broader industry.

874,ALGN,"Regardless of whether it is a young company or a renowned corporation, unswerving earnings growth is the highest priority for the top brass of any organization. And why not? If the company doesn’t make money, it won’t last over the long haul. Consider a company’s revenues over a given period of time, subtract the cost of production and you have earnings.This metric is also considered to be the most noteworthy variable in influencing the share price. But, expectations of earnings also play a significant role in influencing the price of a stock.Earnings Estimates Determine Share PricesWe have often seen a decline in the stock price despite earnings growth and a rally in the price following an earnings decline. This is largely a result of a company’s earnings failing to meet market expectations.Earnings estimates embody analysts’ opinion on factors such as sales growth, product demand, competitive industry environment, profit margins and cost control. Thus, earnings estimates serve as a valuable tool while making investment decisions. Earnings estimates also help analysts assess the cash flow to determine the fair value of a firm.Investors, thus, should be on the lookout for stocks that are ready to make a big move. Hence, it is important for investors to buy stocks that have historical earnings growth and are also seeing a rise in quarterly and annual earnings estimates.Screening Parameters:In order to shortlist stocks that have striking earnings growth and positive estimate revisions, we have added the following parameters:Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2 (Only Zacks' 'Buys' and 'Strong Buys' are allowed. With the Zacks Rank proving itself to be one of the best rating systems out there, this is a great way to start things off.)5-Year Historical EPS Growth (%) greater than X-Industry (stocks with a strong EPS growth history).% Change EPS F(0)/F(-1) greater than or equal to 5 (companies that saw year-over-year earnings growth of 5% or more in the last reported fiscal).% Change Q1 Estimates over the last 4 weeks greater than zero (stocks that have seen their current quarter earnings estimates revised higher in the last 4 weeks).% Change F1 Estimates over the last 1 week greater than zero (stocks that have seen their annual earnings estimates revised higher in the last 1 week).% Change F1 Estimates over the last 4 weeks greater than zero (stocks that have seen their annual earnings estimates revised higher in the last 4 weeks).The above criteria narrowed down the universe of around 7,839 stocks to only nine. Here are the top four stocks:Ollie's Bargain Outlet Holdings, Inc. (OLLI  -  Free Report) operates as a retailer of brand name merchandise. The company carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Its estimated growth rate for this year is 24.4%, higher than the industry’s gain of 7.4%.Dollar Tree, Inc. (DLTR  -  Free Report) operates variety retail stores in the United States and Canada.

In the last reported third quarter, revenues in this business more than doubled on a year-over-year basis with U.S. product revenues being driven by a 139% rise in Prostate test revenues. U.S. prostate volumes increased 39% despite the hurricane impact. Per management, the company continues to be a leader in the low-risk and intermediate-risk prostate cancer market on solid test volumes over the last several quarters.  With a full year of complete Medicare coverage, the company expects its prostate revenues to continue to grow in 2018.Developments in Prostate CancerGenomic Health recently announced an exclusive licensing agreement with biotechnology company Cleveland Diagnostics, Inc. Per the agreement, Genomic Health will be authorized to develop and market early- and late-stage new prostate cancer diagnostics tests based on Cleveland Diagnostics' proprietary IsoPSA reagent and SIA technology.In October, new study results were published validating the Oncotype DX Genomic Prostate Score’s test ability to predict prostate cancer death and the development of metastases at 10 years. With this study, the Oncotype DX GPS test is now uniquely validated to predict both these long-term endpoints as well as the risk of adverse pathology.In August, Genomic Health announced expanded Medicare coverage of the Oncotype DX GPS test post issuance of a positive final Local Coverage Determination (LCD) by Palmetto GBA, a Medicare Administrative Contractor (MAC). Per management, after the successful implementation of the final LCD in October, the total number of Medicare patients eligible for GPS test will increase by around 20,000.Market ProspectsPer a report by Grand View Research, the global prostate cancer therapeutics market is expected to see a CAGR of 4.8% between 2014 and 2025. Considering the huge potential of the market, we believe the latest agreement is a strategic fit for Genomic Health to gain more shares in this space.Stock Performance SolidOver the past three months, Genomic Health has been trading above the broader industry. The stock has lost 7.3%, narrower than the broader industry’s 13.1% decline.Zacks Rank and Key PicksGenomic Health carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked medical stocks are Luminex Corporation (LMNX  -  Free Report), Align Technology, Inc.

877,ALGN,"Myriad Genetics, Inc. (MYGN  -  Free Report) presented encouraging data from a study to evaluate the risk of breast cancer in women of European lineage with a negative myRisk Hereditary Cancer test result for a hereditary cancer mutation. Notably, the results were presented at the 2017 San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium (SABCS) in San Antonio, TX.Per the company, the study — covering 1,617 women: 990 women with breast cancer and 627 controls — was designed to evaluate the new riskScore test's ability to accurately predict the five-year and lifetime risk of breast cancer compared to the Tyrer-Cuzick model alone. The results demonstrated riskScore’s statistically-significant ability to predict the risk of breast cancer in women who have been tested negative for hereditary breast cancer mutations for five years or more.Interestingly, Myriad Genetics has introduced riskScore under its myRisk Hereditary Cancer testing portfolio to solidify its footprint in the rapidly-growing hereditary cancer testing market. Based in Salt Lake City, UT, this leading molecular diagnostics and personalized medicines provider’s proprietary riskScore is a precision medical tool for patients who use myRisk to get their tests done.Recent DevelopmentsIn September, the company introduced riskScore under its myRisk Hereditary Cancer testing portfolio and also presented encouraging riskScore test data. It also announced favorable study results for its myRisk Hereditary Cancer suite. The results were presented at the 36th annual conference of the National Society of Genetic Counselors (NSGC) in Columbus, OH.  In June, the company presented favorable data from a 2,000-patient clinical study with myRisk Hereditary Cancer tests at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO). The results highlighted the importance of the multi-gene panel testing for advancement of the hereditary cancer-risk evaluation platform.Myriad Genetics has been riding high on strength in the Hereditary Cancer testing space. In the last reported quarter, the company witnessed year-over-year growth in Hereditary Cancer testing volumes for the third consecutive quarter, with pricing on par with expectations.Market PotentialPer a report by DPI Research on Medium, the breast cancer screening market in the United States is expected to reach a value of roughly $5.8 billion by 2022. Moreover, per an article by BreastCancer.Org, approximately 252,710 new cases of invasive breast cancer in women are likely to be diagnosed in the United States in 2017. They also project 63,410 new cases of non-invasive (in situ) breast cancer this year as well.We believe an ageing population, rising awareness and expenditure in healthcare will continue to drive growth in the breast cancer screening market. However, this market is dominated by many well-established players, Quest Diagnostics (DGX  -  Free Report) being the most prominent one. In this space, Quest Diagnostics’ Quest Vantage services help in the discovery of genetic variants related to the hereditary risk of 15 types of cancer, including breast, colorectal, pancreatic and renal.Share Price PerformanceMyriad Genetics has been gaining investor confidence on consistently positive results. Over the past year, the company’s share price has outperformed the broader industry.

This is a multiplex assay that runs on the new Panther Fusion system and detects Adenovirus, human Metapneumovirus and Rhinovirus.Per the company, the initial set of modular assays for respiratory viruses is completed with this FDA nod. The latest Panther Fusion assays offer a new-age approach to syndromic respiratory testing with the prolific ability to run one, two or all three assays from a single patient specimen. This assay complements the other two FDA-approved assays namely, the Panther Fusion Flu A/B/RSV and the Panther Fusion Paraflu variety.The Panther Fusion module is an in-lab upgrade to the original Panther instrument. Apart from the Panther platform’s existing benefits, this new system adds flexibility of PCR (polymerase chain reaction) to the proven performance of transcription-mediated amplification (TMA), used by the Panther system.Market ProspectsPer CISION, the molecular diagnostics market is projected to reach a worth of $10.12 billion at a CAGR of 9.1% from 2016 till 2021. Considering this huge market potential, we believe the company’s latest development is quite strategic.  Hologic is consistently trying to expand its Diagnostic segment, which generated a 36.3% of total revenues in the last reported fiscal fourth quarter despite facing a year-over-year decline of 6.5%.  Under this segment, Molecular Diagnostics revenues increased 14.3% (13.8% at CER). Notably, by the end of 2017, Hologic had shipped about 1,300 Panthers to Diagnostics customers worldwide.Stock Performance SolidOver the past month, Hologic has outperformed the broader industry.

879,ALGN,"On Dec 4, we issued an updated research report on Chemed Corporation (CHE  -  Free Report). The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Over the last three months, Chemed has been trading above the broader industry. The stock has gained 24.1% against the industry’s decline of 7.9%. Improvement in average net Medicare reimbursement rate and an increase in average daily census during the recently-reported third quarter were encouraging. The raised outlook for the Roto-Rooter segment and earnings per share is indicative of the company’s expectations of improved operating results in the upcoming quarters, which in turn boosts investors’ optimism on the stock.Within Chemed’s VITAS business, management noted that the recent admission trends have been positive and are expected to continue. During third-quarter 2017, VITAS performed well, financially and operationally, on the back of an increase in the geographically weighted average Medicare reimbursement rate and rise in average daily census.The company continues to display robust performance in the Roto-Rooter business on strength in core plumbing and drain cleaning service segments. The comapny has also witnessed a solid growth in water restoration.  Additionally, the company’s strong cash balance enables it to carry out share repurchase programs, providing solid returns to investors. Moreover, the expansion in gross and operating margin in the last reported quarter buoys optimism.However, headwinds like expensive valuation, reimbursement-related issues, seasonality in business, a competitive landscape and dependence on government mandate pose challenges for Chemed. Moreover, more than 90% of VITAS’ revenues are payments from the Medicare and Medicaid programs which raise concerns. Also, a tweaked guidance for Medicare Cap billing limitations is dampening.Estimate Revision TrendThe company’s estimate revision trend for the current year is positive. In the past 60 days, one analyst revised estimate upward, with no movement in the opposite direction. The magnitude of estimate revision for earnings increased around 2.3% to $8.39.Other Key PicksA few other top-ranked medical stocks are PetMed Express, Inc.

880,ALGN,"Align Technology, Inc. (ALGN  -  Free Report) is set to report fourth-quarter 2017 earnings results on Jan 30, after market close.Last quarter, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 23.2%. Align Technology has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the preceding four quarters, the average positive earnings surprise being 16.6%. Let’s take a look at how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayThis leading manufacturer and marketer of a system of clear aligner therapy, intra-oral scanners and CAD/CAM (computer-aided design and manufacturing) digital services used in dentistry, orthodontics and dental records storage has been witnessing strong revenue growth from the Scanner and Service business over the past few quarters. Moreover, the company has been seeing increased adoption of iTero scanners for Invisalign case submissions instead of PVS impressions, especially in North America, thereby driving Invisalign utilization. Management expects this bullish trend to reflect in the fourth-quarter results as well.At the same time, Align Technology has been focusing on expanding work flow options of iTero scanners. In this context, we are upbeat about the company’s iTero Element intraoral scanning system available as part of Patterson Dental’s CAD/CAM portfolio in the United States and Canada. Moreover, the company launching a software upgrade to its iTero Element intraoral scanner that is capable of comparing patient scans over time with the latest TimeLapse technology also boosts our confidence on the stock.Also, the company collaborated with exocad GmbH last March, whereby the integrated portfolio will result in high-tech workflow solution for efficient scanning, designing and manufacturing of in-house dental prosthesis. With these positives in place, Align Technology is expected to witness solid top-line contributions from the Scanner and Service business in the fourth-quarter results.Investors may also be looking forward to the company’s recent signing of an agreement with Glidewell Dental to distribute the iTero Element intraoral scanning system with the latest glidewell.io In-Office Solution in North America. Per management, the collaboration will widen iTero’s reach to more than 50,000 dentists using Glidewell services. Notably, the company aims a launch in first-quarter 2018.Align Technology, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Align Technology, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Align Technology, Inc. QuoteAlign Technology achieved a milestone of five million patients undergoing treatment with its flagship clear aligner system — InvisAlign — in November 2017. The company has been adopting several strategies to drive adoption of its core InvisAlign product line.In terms of product development, in 2017, the company received two U.S. patents for Align Technology’s SmartTrack aligner material that is exclusively used for InvisAlign aligner treatment. Moreover, in a bid to gain traction in the InvisAlign platform, Align Technology collaborated with Digital Smile Design last March.Meanwhile, in order to expand its Invisalign brand offerings, Align Technology introduced a patient-friendly solution — Invisalign Teen with mandibular advancement — for teens in certain markets of Canada, Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) and Asia-Pacific (APAC) in the first half of 2017.Coming to geographic expansion, the company opened its first office in Canada — a major market in terms of opportunity for expansion and growth. Management launched InvisAlign Technology Lite in North America post its introduction in the EMEA. The company witnessed strong adoption, particularly among GP dentists.Moreover, Align Technology has been witnessing continued adoption of InvisAlign Technology in core markets in the EMEA and APAC regions. Interestingly, in the recently reported third quarter, the company achieved another milestone in terms of InvisAlign therapy adoption, where China became the second-largest InvisAlign market with United States topping the numbers. Align Technology registered almost a threefold year-over-year increase in its asset customer base, with major contributions from China. Also, in a bid to expand in the region, the company opened a InvisAlign Treatment Planning Facility in China last June.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues of $395.48 million in fourth-quarter 2017 indicates a rise of 34.9% from the year-ago quarter.Earnings Whispers    Our proven model does not conclusively show that Align Technology is likely to beat earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Align Technology has an Earnings ESP of -1.39%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at 95 cents while the Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at 96 cents.Zacks Rank: Align Technology carries a Zacks Rank #3 which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, an ESP of -1.39% makes surprise prediction difficult.Meanwhile, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 and 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revision momentum.Nonetheless, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of 96 cents reflects 43.3% growth from the year-ago quarter.Stocks Worth a LookHere are a few medical stocks worth considering as they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Bio-Rad Laboratories (BIO  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +4.45% and a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Myriad Genetics (MYGN  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.42% and a Zacks Rank #3.Henry Schein (HSIC  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.35% and a Zacks Rank #3.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

881,ALGN,"On Nov 21, we issued an updated research report on Warsaw, IN-based Zimmer Biomet Holdings Inc. (ZBH  -  Free Report). The company carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Over the last three months, this leading musculoskeletal healthcare company was trading below the broader industry on macroeconomic uncertainties, pricing pressure and unfavorable currency fluctuations. The stock has gained 0.2% versus the broader industry’s 7% gain.The company’s third-quarter results fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate and its own expectations. Per management, Zimmer Biomet is grappling with headwinds such as supply delay of certain products, leading to the inability of regaining lost customers in the United States and tapping new ones; the softened domestic market conditions; the impact of consecutive hurricanes and a significant price reduction in the Indian knee market. The trimmed 2017 guidance adds to our concerns indicating little chances of recovery ahead.Estimate revision trend for 2017 also remains unfavorable with 17 estimates moving south and none in the opposite direction over the past month. The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate being revised 20 cents downward over this period to $8.04 per share.On a positive note, we look forward to the expected synergies to be drawn from the recently completed LDR Holding acquisition, which should broaden and complement the company’s musculoskeletal offering. This is in line with its strategy to grow through inorganic means by focusing on mega buyouts. We are also impressed by the strong strategic and financial goals which the combined entity anticipates to reach, now that the deal has been closed.Zimmer Biomet has been of late working to strengthen its foothold in the emerging markets that provide long-term opportunities. The company’s strategic investments in these regions over several quarters with a view to enhance operational and sales performance are yielding results.Key PicksA few better-ranked medical stocks are PetMed Express, Inc.

Align Technology’s receipt of two U.S. patents for SmartTrack Aligner material also buoys optimism.On the flipside, adverse foreign exchange translation continues to raise concerns for Align Technology’s international operations.

884,ALGN,"On Nov 21, we issued an updated research report on Henry Schein, Inc. (HSIC  -  Free Report). The company carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Henry Schein exited third-quarter 2017 on a mixed note with earnings missing and revenues beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate. We are disappointed with the company’s lowering of the high end of the 2017 EPS guidance. Meanwhile, the year-over-year deterioration in Henry Schein’s gross and operating margin was led by higher cost of sales and expenses. A tough competitive landscape and pricing pressure also weigh on the stock.Shares of the company have underperformed the broader industry over the past month. The stock has lost 20.8% against the 1.6% gain of the broader industry.On a positive note, we expect this trend to improve on balanced growth across all four operating segments of Henry Schein. We are also encouraged by the company’s efforts to grow internationally. Apart from North America and Europe, it has presence in Australia and New Zealand as well as in the emerging markets of China, Brazil, Israel, Czech Republic and Poland.Henry Schein, Inc. Price Henry Schein, Inc. Price | Henry Schein, Inc. QuoteAlso, this leading distributor of health care products and services across the globe continues to ride high within its dental business on majorly accretive strategic mergers and integrations. One colossal merger in this field is Poland-based Dental Cremer in 2016.Also, Henry Schein might gain from several trends in end markets like customer demographics.

885,ALGN,"Medtronic plc (MDT  -  Free Report) announced the receipt of FDA approval and commercial launch of its portfolio of Azure pacemakers with BlueSync technology. According to the company, this technology enables secure, automatic and wireless remote monitoring via the Medtronic CareLink Network. Security controls implemented and validated on BlueSync-enabled devices include access restrictions to protect integrity of device functionality and end-to-end encryption to protect patient data.The Azure XT MRI and Azure S MRI pacemakers are available in single chamber and dual chamber models. These pacemakers offer improved longevity (27% longer than its predecessor) and better ability to detect and reduce atrial fibrillation (AF). AF, one of the most common heart rhythm disorders, is irregular or rapid beating of the heart’s upper chambers. With these pacemakers, patients will probably need lesser device replacement.The Azure XT pacemaker features the Medtronic Reactive ATP (atrial-based antitachycardia pacing) algorithm, which was proved to slow the progression of AF in implanted cardiac devices patients.  The company is consistently trying to improve its Cardiac Rhythm and Heart Failure division —part of Cardiac & Vascular Group (CVG). In line with this, Medtronic came up with favorable study results on Reactive ATP (atrial-based antitachycardia pacing) therapy in June. Reactive ATP) therapy slows the progression of AF in patients with implanted cardiac devices. A couple of achievements from the month of May are worth a mention. Medtronic received FDA approval for a portfolio of quadripolar cardiac resynchronization therapy-pacemakers (CRT-Ps) that improve therapy delivery for patients with heart failure.  Medtronic also announced favorable results from a clinical study which showed that Insertable Cardiac Monitors (ICM) detected a high incidence of AF in patients previously undiagnosed but suspected to be at high-risk for AF and stroke.According to a report by Allied Market Research, the global cardiac monitoring & cardiac rhythm management market is expected to reach a worth of $32,216 million by 2022, at a CAGR of 7.6%. Looking at the bountiful opportunities in this niche space, we believe the company’s latest development is strategic.Over the last three months, Medtronic has underperformed the broader industry.

886,ALGN,"On Nov 20, we issued an updated research report on DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc. (XRAY  -  Free Report) — a global leader in the design, development, manufacture and marketing of dental consumables and dental laboratory products.The New York-based company recently announced the renewal of an existing distribution agreement with Henry Schein Canada, Inc, which will continue till Dec 31, 2020. Henry Schein's agreement with DENTSPLY SIRONA was initiated in August 2005.The deal extension is a smart move by DENTSPLY SIRONA as the preexisting agreement did not include the CEREC CAD/CAM restoration system and the Schick line of imaging sensors. By including the aforementioned lines of products, the company will benefit from Henry Schein’s distribution network in Canada.Among the recent developments, the company announced the renewal of its partnership with Pacific Dental Services. This move strategic as Pacific Dental’s network consists of over 580 centers in 17 states. During the tenure of the present agreement, management expects the number of such offices utilizing DENTSPLY SIRONA’s technologies to exceed 800.DENTSPLY SIRONA’s dual branding strategy, product innovation, growth opportunities in emerging markets (especially Asia-Pacific and Middle East/Africa), diversified product portfolio and recurring revenue base are key catalysts. The company expects a solid guidance for 2017 projecting adjusted EPS in the range of $2.65-$2.70.On the flip side, apart from a series of macroeconomic headwinds, currency fluctuation continues to be a major dampener. In fact, strengthening of the U.S. dollar against Euro and other emerging market currencies has dented the company’s growth trajectory. Further, higher capital expenditure on product development is expected to keep margins under pressure.DENTSPLY SIRONA’s price movement has been favorable in the last three months.

The stock has shed 6.8%, as against the industry’s gain of 0.4%. The company continues to witness strong growth in pharma and biotech backed by solid market fundamentals and planned growth strategy.  McKesson delivered stable results in the recently reported second-quarter fiscal 2018, wherein adjusted earnings and revenues missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The quarter witnessed strong performance by the Distribution Solutions segment. The segment is expected to remain consistent with its performance in fiscal 2018 despite weak pricing trends and customer consolidation. To boost growth, the company recently acquired CoverMyMeds for approximately $1.1 billion.Coming to guidance, the Distribution Solutions business revenues are expected to witness robust growth on a year-over-year basis. The upside is expected to be driven by market growth and acquisitions. McKesson expects GAAP earnings per diluted share of $4.80 to $6.90 for the fiscal year ending Mar 31, 2018. Adjusted earnings for the same fiscal are projected in the range of $11.80-$12.50.On the flipside, pricing pressure in the independent retail pharmacy channel is a headwind. McKesson entered fiscal 2018 with an assumption of branded inflation in the mid-single digits. The first-quarter results slightly surpassed expectations.McKesson has been witnessing increased price competition in the independent retail pharmacy channel, which resulted in reduced volumes. The company continues to witness a competitive market for selling generic pharmaceuticals in the United States.

890,ALGN,"Investors always seek a winning strategy. However, finding such a strategy is easier said than done. When markets are shaken by widespread global growth concerns, it is difficult for even an insightful investor to come up with a foolproof approach.No matter how disciplined and systematic investors are, equity market volatility will always manage to get the better of them. While a few lucky ones rake in the moolah, others fall victim to ad hoc strategies.One could resort to commonly used techniques to find beaten down stocks that have the potential to recover faster than others. However, even such investment choices bear the risk of disappointment. Particularly, one could be stuck in a value trap if the hidden weaknesses in selected stock are not identified.So, wouldn’t it be safer to look for stocks that are winners currently and have the potential to gain further?Here’s how to execute it:One should primarily look for stocks that have recently been witnessing price increase. Actually, stocks seeing price strength recently have a high chance of carrying the momentum forward.If a stock is continuously moving higher, there must be a good reason for the rise or else it probably would have fallen like the losers. So, looking at stocks that have already won the game and are capable of beating the benchmark that they have set is rational.However, recent price strength alone cannot create magic, so you need to set other relevant parameters to create a successful investment strategy.Here’s how you should create the screen to shortlist the current as well as the potential winners.Screening Parameters:Percentage Change in Price (4 Weeks) greater than zero: This criterion shows that the stock has moved higher in the last four weeks.Percentage Change Price (12 Weeks) greater than 10:This indicates that the stock has seen momentum over the last three months. This lowers the risk of choosing stocks that may have drawn attention due to the overwhelming performance of the overall market in a very short period.Zacks Rank 1:No matter whether market conditions are good or bad, stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) have a proven history of outperformance. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Average Broker Rating 1:This indicates that brokers are also highly hopeful about the stock’s future performance.Current Price greater than 5:The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of $5.Current Price/ 52-Week High-Low Range more than 85%: This criterion filters stocks that are trading near their respective 52-week highs. It indicates that these are strong enough in terms of price.Here are five of the 11 stocks that made it through this screen:Daqo New Energy Corp. (DQ  -  Free Report) is engaged in the manufacture and sale of high-quality polysilicon to photovoltaic product manufacturers. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 62.1%.Align Technology Inc. (ALGN  -  Free Report) designs, manufactures and markets the Invisalign System, a proprietary method for treating malocclusion.

891,ALGN,"On Nov 17, we issued an updated research report on Chesterbrook, PA-based AmerisourceBergen Corporation (ABC  -  Free Report), one of the world’s largest pharmaceutical services companies. The company focuses on providing drug distribution and related services to reduce health care costs and improve patient outcome.AmerisourceBergen had an unimpressive run on the bourse in the last three months, trading below the industry in terms of price performance. A glimpse at the price movement reveals that AmerisourceBergen’s shares have returned only 1.0% compared with the industry’s rally of 4.9%.The unfavorable performance was a result of pricing pressure in the generic drug space and lackluster guidance for the full year. AmerisourceBergen expects fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings per share for fiscal 2018 in the band of $5.90-$6.15. Revenue growth for is expected in the range of 7-9%.AmerisourceBergen expects adjusted operating expenses to increase in the range of 4-6%, while adjusted operating income growth is estimated in the band of 3-5%.Meanwhile, operating income growth at the pharmaceutical distribution services segment is projected in the range of 3-5%.AmerisourceBergen acquired PharMEDium Healthcare Holdings for $2.58 billion back in 2015. We believe that the temporary slowdown in PharMEDium growth will mar AmerisourceBergen's bottom line in the upcoming quarters. Notably, the company aims to boost investments to enhance PharMEDium's quality assurance (QA) and quality control (QC) systems in terms of product quality and patient safety. Although this lends the company a competitive advantage in the long haul, this might result in a bottom-line headwind in fiscal 2018.Lackluster performance in the hepatitis C revenue segment is another concern. Recently, AmerisourceBergen witnessed a negative revenue impact from declining sales in owing to the adverse impact of the hepatitis C segment.Cutthroat competition in the niche space is an additional concern. AmerisourceBergen operates in a highly competitive pharmaceutical distribution and related health care services market. The company’s primary competitors are national generic and regional distributors.The generic industry is witnessing consolidation of customers and manufacturers, globalization and increasing quality along with regulatory challenges. The company also faces competition from manufacturers, chain drugstores, specialty distributors and packaging and health care technology companies.Zacks Rank & Key PicksAmerisourceBergen carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

892,ALGN,"On Aug 9, we issued an updated research report on Rhode Island-based pharmacy retail giant, CVS Health Corp. (CVS  -  Free Report), which provides integrated offerings across the entire spectrum of pharmacy care.Post a better-than-expected performance in the second quarter, CVS Health was observed trading significantly ahead of the broader industry. Per the last three months’ share price movement, the stock has lost 1.9% over this period, narrower than the broader industry’s 4.9% loss.On a positive note, strong Pharmacy Services numbers benefited from the upside in Specialty Pharmacy. Per a recent data, three million people in the U.S. are currently in need of specialty treatment which has high potential costs. With management emphasizing that CVS Health’s specialty business remains a top priority for its customers, we believe it is well-positioned to tap this opportunity based on the broad, differentiated offerings, including the likes of Specialty Connect.The company’s strong PBM selling season also looks encouraging. Regarding 2018 selling season, despite the magnitude of bidding opportunities being flat to down year over year, the company had a successful quarter. While gross new business was $5.4 billion, net new business also reached an impressive $1.8 billion. These new business numbers include loss of the FEP specialty contract but lack any impact from individual Med D PDP (prescription drug plan). The company has already completed about 70% of client renewals for 2018. Despite a soft bottom line, the company narrowed its 2017 earnings outlook, indicating chances of recovery ahead. We believe, both the Omnicare and Target Pharmacy buyouts, which have already started to benefit CVS Health on multiple prospects, should drive the enterprise value significantly in the coming days.However, poor year-over-year Retail/LTC (long-term care)numbers along with margin debacle dragged the bottom line, last quarter. Notably, the highly competitive retail pharmacy market too seems to pose a threat. Also, the sluggish economic condition in the U.S. is a concern.The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Key PicksA few better-ranked medical stocks are Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (EW  -  Free Report), Myriad Genetics, Inc. (MYGN  -  Free Report) and Align Technology, Inc. (ALGN  -  Free Report).

Despite the encouraging growth in the Plasma and Haemonetics Management franchises, the underperformance at BloodCenter franchisee was quite a dampener.Meanwhile, the company’s strong cash position boosts investors’ confidence. Also, the year-over-year increase in reported sales and gross margin buoys optimism. The company swung to operating income in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 from losses in the year-ago quarter. Haemonetics is also optimistic about strong market adoption of its NexSys PCS plasmapheresis system which recently received FDA approval.On the flip side, over the last three months, Haemonetics’ valuation looks stretched in terms of price-to-earnings ratio (P/E - F12M) when compared to its own industry. Also, Haemonetics has been consistently witnessing sluggish revenue growth at its Blood Center franchise. Further, macroeconomic uncertainty continues to pose a challenge. Moreover, a stiff competitive landscape adds to the woes.Other Key PicksOther top-ranked medical stocks are Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (EW  -  Free Report), Myriad Genetics, Inc.

898,ALGN,"STERIS Plc (STE  -  Free Report) reported first-quarter fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of 85 cents, up 7.6% from the year-ago quarter. This adjusted EPS figure also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 80 cents.On a reported basis, the quarter’s EPS came in at 68 cents, up 21.4% year over year.Revenues in DetailSTERIS generated revenues of $608 million, down 4.8% year over year. However, the top line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $596 million. The year-over-year decline was a result of foreign currency fluctuations as well as divested businesses. Organic revenue growth at constant currency was 6% year over year, primarily driven by balanced growth in all segments.STERIS PLC Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise STERIS PLC Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | STERIS PLC QuoteThe company operates through four segments: Healthcare Products, Healthcare Specialty Services, Applied Sterilization Technologies and Life Sciences.Revenues from the Healthcare Products segment inched up 2% year over year to $289.1 million in the reported quarter. This was driven by 7% growth in service revenue and a 2% increase in capital equipment revenue, which in turn were partially offset by a 1% dip in Consumables due to divestitures. Revenues from the Healthcare Specialty Services segment plunged 25.4% to $113.4 million on a reported basis due to divestitures. However, organic revenues grew 11%, reflecting growth at IMS North America and CSD outsourcing business in Europe.On the other hand, revenues from Applied Sterilization Technologies rose 2% to $124.5 million and organic revenue growth was 6%, on the back of an increased volume from the segment`s core medical device customers.Lastly, revenues from the Life Sciences segment dropped 1% to $80.9 million in the quarter as 5% growth in Service revenue and 2% increase in consumable revenues were more than offset by a 12% decrease in capital equipment revenues. On an organic basis, revenues nudged up 1% year over year. MarginsAdjusted gross margin improved 410 basis points (bps) year over year to 42.3% in the reported quarter. This expansion was on account of the positive impact of divested low-margin businesses,improvements in operational efficiencies, a favorable foreign currency, plus cost synergies and pricing.STERIS witnessed a 2.6% year-over-year rise in selling, general and administrative expenses to $155.8 million. Research and development expenses fell 2.8% to $14 million. Adjusted operating margin expanded 265 bps on a year-over-year basis to 14.2% in the reported quarter.Financial DetailsSTERIS exited the first-quarter fiscal 2018 with cash and cash equivalents of $294.8 million compared with $282.9 million at the end of fiscal 2017. The company had a long-term debt of $1.49 billion at the end of first-quarter fiscal 2018 compared with $1.48 billion at the end of fiscal 2017.The company generated $80.7 million in cash flow from operations in first quarter, up 0.5% from the year-ago period. Free cash flow for this period was $44.2 million compared with $49.5 million in the prior-year time frame.2018 GuidanceSTERIS continues to expect 4–5% of organic revenue growth on constant-currency basis in fiscal 2018 from the prior fiscal year. Adjusted EPS is expected in the range of $3.96–$4.09 per share.Our TakeSTERIS posted better-than-expected first-quarter fiscal 2018 with both earnings and revenues beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, the year-over-year decline in revenues is a disappointment. On a positive note, organic growth performance was strong across all the segments. Further, growth in free cash flow reserve is indicative of the company’s strong cash balance. Recently, the company has made a couple of organizational changes, expected to better align with its operations.Zacks Rank & Key PicksSTERIS currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

899,ALGN,"Chemed Corporation (CHE  -  Free Report), a leading manufacturer of products and services primarily for the companion animal veterinary, has gained 5.1% over the last six months, thus beating the S&P 500’s 2.9% gain. The stock has a market cap of $3 billion. The company’s five-year expected growth rate is also impressive at 10%.The company further represented a return of almost 42.2%, substantially higher than the industry’s 5.1% gain over the last year. With solid prospects, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock is an attractive pick at the moment.The company’s estimate revision trend for the current year has also been positive. In the past 60 days, one estimate moved north, with no movement in the opposite direction. The magnitude of estimate revision for earnings per share rose around 2.9% to $8.17 over the same time frame.Let’s find out whether the recent positive trend is a sustainable one.Chemed’s second-quarter 2017 performance was quite promising with the bottom line significantly improving on a year-over-year basis. This stellar performance was driven by the company’s increase in the average net Medicare reimbursement rate and average daily census.Keeping this momentum up, encouraging revenue growth and raised guidance for 2017 further indicate the company’s brighter prospects. The promising outlook for both Roto-Rooter segment and bottom line also supports the company’s estimation of improved operating results in the upcoming quarters. In fact, the view raise was backed by the company’s expectation of significant gains from its Roto-Rooter business.Chemed’s VITAS business was in trouble over the past few quarters due to certain admission coding changes initiated by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). However, management recently noted that the recent admission trends have been positive which should continue in the coming quarters. During second-quarter 2017, VITAS performed well, both financially and operationally, thereby surpassing the company’s estimates.Additionally, the company’s strong cash balance enables it to carry out share repurchase programs and in turn, provides solid returns to investors.Other Key PicksOther top-ranked medical stocks are IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.

900,ALGN,"On Aug 21, we issued an updated research report on Elmsford, NY-based BioScrip, Inc. (BIOS  -  Free Report). The company is a leading Infusion Service provider and strives to deliver cost-effective programs to patients. The stock currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Over the past month, BioScrip has been trading above the broader industry. The stock has gained 3.7% in this period, as against the industry’s 9% loss. The market is upbeat about the company’s announcement to continue to offer certain core product lines to UnitedHealthcare. This deal should be significantly accretive to BioScrip’s top line.The company’s progress for new multi-faceted CORE plan to improve financial position is also encouraging. The plan involves identifying and executing strategies to accelerate core revenue growth, favorable product mix, drive operational efficiency, improve revenue collection and increase employee effectiveness.Further, BioScrip had successfully completed the Home Solutions’ integration earlier this year. The company expects core revenues as well as continued growth from this acquired asset to prove accretive, going forward.Notably, BioScrip has been recording persistent growth in its core Infusion Services business with strong presence as well as a competitive advantage. The company witnessed a consistent rise in this business, primarily on account of strong organic growth in chronic, nutrition and other therapies. It has been building a robust core Infusion platform through organic development and acquisitions.Management expects BioScrip’s focus on the fast-growing core Infusion business to drive an increased profitability. The company is currently on track to achieve the previously announced $17 million in Home Solutions synergies and other incremental annualized cost-reductions of $23-$25 million by 2017-end.On the flip side, BioScrip’s 2017 guidance is lackluster with the inclusion of an estimated negative impact of the Cures Act legislation. A large portion of the company’s revenues used to come directly from Medicare, state Medicaid programs or other government payers. However, the new Cures Act bill does not reimburse any service payments for administration of certain drugs to patients via home infusion pharmacies.The healthcare industry is also highly competitive. BioScrip’s competitors include large and well-established companies with higher financial, marketing and technological resources.Key PicksA few better-ranked medical stocks are IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.

The company currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Stryker had an impressive run on the bourse over the last three months, trading above the industry in terms of price performance. A glimpse at the price movement reveals that Stryker’s shares haves gained 4.1%, comparing favorably with the 2.9% rise of the  industry it belongs to.The company has a diverse product portfolio which cushions it against any significant sales shortfall during economic downturns. Stryker’s pipeline includes products for Hip, Knee and Mako Robotic-Arm Assisted Surgeries. MAKO results in the last quarter were solid, with almost 26 global robot installations, of which 24 were in the United States.Furthermore, the platforms of bone cement, sports-medicine, bones substitute, soft tissue repair, trauma and extremities, endoscopy and more fortify the company’s market position.Stryker has been following an acquisition-driven strategy to boost its growth profile. In June, the company announced a definitive agreement to acquire NOVADAQ Technologies Inc. for $11.75 per share or $701 million with a net purchase price of $654 million. The transaction is structured as an arrangement under the Canada Business Corporations Act and is subject to customary closing conditions, including approval by NOVADAQ’s shareholders.Stryker has been focusing on international growth as well. In particular, the company’s Medsurg product line has witnessed strong demand in the European and Australian markets in the second quarter of 2017. On the flip side, China might prove to be a challenging market.Stryker’s strong guidance is also a catalyst. For the third quarter of 2017, the company expects adjusted earnings in the range of $1.50–$1.55 per share. For the full year, the company estimates adjusted earnings in the band of $6.45–$6.55.

902,ALGN,"On Aug 14, we issued an updated research report on Warsaw, IN-based Zimmer Biomet Holdings Inc. (ZBH  -  Free Report), a leading musculoskeletal healthcare company. It designs and distributes orthopedic reconstructive products, spine, bone healing, thoracic products, dental implants and related surgical products.Over the last three months, Zimmer Biomet was trading below the industry on factors like macroeconomic uncertainties, pricing pressure and unfavorable currency fluctuations. The stock has till now lost 4.5% compared against the industry’s 4% gain.With the company delivering a dull second-quarter result, we expect this downside to continue in the upcoming period. Per management, the company is still fighting headwinds such as slump in knee business, shortage in supply of some products, thus leading to inability to recapture the lost customers across the United States and gain new ones. Also, the trimmed 2017 guidance adds to our concerns indicating slim chances of recovery ahead.The market also seems to be apprehensive about the departure of Zimmer Biomet’s decade-old CEO David C.

904,ALGN,"On Aug 18, we issued an updated research report on Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (WBA  -  Free Report), the Illinois-based leading pharmacy-led, health and wellbeing enterprise. The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Walgreens has outperformed its industry with respect to share price movement in the last month. The stock has gained 1.7%, ahead of the industry’s 1% rise during the period. Walgreens’ shelving of the $17 billion Rite Aid (RAD  -  Free Report) acquisition deal came as a huge setback to the company’s investors. The buyout deal had once promised a strong platform for developing the company’s brand presence as well as its overall future business growth. However, delving into the deal’s latest  details, we believe there is still much to hope for.The new agreement would enable Walgreens to purchase nearly half of the Rite Aid business at a deal value, almost one-third of the original price. More specifically, the acquirer will take over nearly 2,186 stores, three distribution centers and a related inventory from Rite Aid for $5.175 billion in cash. Notably, the latter ran about 4,523 stores across 31 states and the District of Columbia as of Jun 3, 2017.This apart, the contract’s financial outcome is pretty attractive. Post the new transaction’s initial closing, Walgreens expects it to be modestly accretive to its adjusted diluted net earnings per share in the first full year. Synergies from this new takeover are expected in excess of $400 million, to be entirely realized within three to four years of its initial closing.Per Walgreens, this modified merger contract will also extend its growth strategy and offer additional operational plus financial benefits. It will help the company expand and optimize its retail pharmacy network in the key U.S. markets, including the Northeast. This partial consolidation with Rite Aid will help Walgreens gain a competitive edge.Besides, the company’s new strategic pharmacy tie-ups and several recent programs including skin product launch and vaccination are encouraging. Earlier this year, the company partnered with communication service provider WPP to operate and develop multiple marketing and communications channels for its retail and wholesale businesses as well as its health and beauty product brands.Walgreens Boots also inked a multi-year partnership agreement with global express delivery service provider FedEx Corporation. The alliance is aimed at offering convenient access to FedEx drop-off and pickup services at several Walgreens Boots locations across the United States.In the last few years, a slowdown in generic introduction, increased reimbursement pressure and generic drug cost inflation have been hampering the company’s margin significantly. Also, Walgreens Boots faces obstacles like increased competition and tough industry conditions. Even though the company continues to gain a decent market share from other traditional drug store retailers, major mass merchants namely Target and Wal-Mart are on track to expand their pharmacy businesses.Risks from other channels such as supermarkets and mail order operations also pose a threat. In addition, industry conditions remain challenging as insurers slash reimbursement rates and raise prescription co-payments. Plus, currency fluctuations, weak macroeconomic environment and delay of Walgreens Boots’ long impending buyout of Rite Aid emerge as other headwinds.Key PicksSome of the better-ranked medical stocks are Align Technology, Inc. (ALGN  -  Free Report) and IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. (IDXX  -  Free Report). While Align Technology sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), IDEXX Laboratories carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

905,ALGN,"South San Francisco, CA-based Fluidigm Corporation (FLDM  -  Free Report), a leading player in the analysis of single cells and industrial application of genomics, recently announced that it has entered into a licensing agreement with Baylor Genetics.Per the agreement, Fluidigm licensed the rights to commercialize the CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator) library prep assay developed by Baylor Genetics for research purposes. This would be used with its proprietary Juno automated microfluidic system. The targeted library prep assay enables accurate identification of variants from each of the 27 exons in the CFTR gene and selected intronic regions. When combined with Fluidigm microfluidics, this solution has the potential to significantly simplify complex labor-intensive laboratory workflows and improve the efficiency of CFTR sequencing. This would invariably improve the efficiency of its Juno automated microfluidic system and help the company to capture a considerable market share.Next-generation sequencing offers a more comprehensive approach to CFTR genetic analysis by allowing a complete view of the sequence. Targeted sequencing library prep workflows, however, can be very labor-intensive. With the application of Fluidigm automated microfluidics technology, library preparation can be streamlined to provide significant efficiencies.Over the past one month, Fluidigm has underperformed the broader industry. The stock has shed 7.1%, compared with the industry’s decline of 3.1%.Fluidigm develops, manufactures and markets life science analytical and preparatory systems for markets such as mass cytometry, high-throughput genomics, and single cell genomics.

Per the company, this is a website containing more than 50 Walgreens outcomes studies, completed over the past six years.The research areas of Center for Health & Wellbeing Research provide access to care and patient experience, adherence and clinical outcomes, digital health and member engagement, health care costs, HIV and specialty pharmacy, vaccinations among others. With twin target, this new online institution intends to help improve patient care and outcomes through scientific research at reasonable health care costs.The Walgreens Center for Health & Wellbeing Research team comprises more than 25 Walgreens health services researchers, clinicians, statisticians, public health practitioners, actuaries and data scientists. Notably, there are also quite a few scientific research partners of Walgreens, all dedicated to enhance healthcare values. These academic institutes are Johns Hopkins Medicine and the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health besides the Scripps Translational Science Institute, the University of California, San Francisco - School of Pharmacy and the University of Chicago Medicine.Several research studies have already been published by the entire team. One such study is on pharmacy patients enrolled in Medicare Prescription Drug Plans. Per the company, the study found that “patients who were late to refill prescriptions and who received reminder calls from local Walgreens pharmacists demonstrated nearly 23% greater adherence within the first 14 days of the expected refill date.”In this context, let us brief a few lines on the company’s earlier-announced strategic goals that aimed to maximize its scope and scale over time.

908,ALGN,"Medication and supply management and adherence tools provider Omnicell, Inc. (OMCL  -  Free Report) recently advanced its Patient Management Access Portal (PMAP) with four new enhancements to help it improve patient outcome.Notably, this single, web-based portal hosts functionality to guide and track patient notes, interventions and appointments. It also provides a detailed information on the patients to the respective pharmacist by identifying, preparing and documenting the ongoing patient engagement.The latest enhancements to the PMAP include Targeted Adherence Interventions for patients, who are new to chronic therapy. Also, there is a Time My Meds dashboard, providing pharmacists with individualized performance snapshots. These enhancements also consist of single sign-on integration with a third party software, helping the pharmasists assist patients with a Medicare plan option and Immunization Solutions to aid in identifying those in need of vaccinations while simplifying a pharmacist’s workflow.Per Omnicell, all these advancements will together make PMAP a more comprehensive web portal, prompting the pharmacists to provide a personalized care to medically complex patients while maintaining effective services. Further good news is that this initiative will lead to curbing healthcare costs.Per the data provided by Omnicell, currently more than 30 million Americans are taking five or more maintenance medications daily. However, only half of all chronic-condition patients, who require medications, do not take them as prescribed. This accounts for a 30-50% of all treatment failures and 125,000 deaths annually. With people gradually realizing the importance of medication adherence, the market potential of PMAP-like web portals seems huge. We expect this latest feature-enhancement of PMAP to result in better market adoption of the system.For most part of the past three months, Omnicell’s share price consistently underperformed the industry. However, the company has picked up some steam post its impressive second-quarter results with a year-over-year increase in both earnings and revenues. Accordingly, the stock has surged 24.2%, significantly ahead of the industry’s 4.6% gain. With Omnicell putting efforts in product innovation through research and development, we expect the company to maintain this bullish momentum going ahead.Zacks Rank & Key PicksOmnicell currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

910,ALGN,"BioScrip, Inc. (BIOS  -  Free Report) reported net loss from continuing operations of 11 cents per share in the second quarter of 2017, compared to net loss of 8 cents a year ago. The Zacks Consensus Estimate was pegged at a loss of 10 cents. RevenuesWith the completion of the company’s non-core PBM business divestment (treated as discontinued operation in the previous quarter), BioScrip currently has a simplified business structure focused on core Infusion Services.Revenues from continuing operations in the second quarter fell 6.2% year over year to $218.1 million and also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $220 million. The year-over-year decline was due to the company’s shift in strategy to focus on growing its core revenue mix coupled with the impact of the Cures Act along with and contract modifications with UnitedHealthcare. This was partially offset by synergies from the Home Solutions acquisition.BioScrip, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise BioScrip, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | BioScrip, Inc. QuoteGross profit in the second quarter was $68.3 million, up 6.5% year over year. Gross margin also expanded 370 basis points (bps) to 31.3%.

Adjusted operating margin expanded 310 bps year over year to 26.7%.FinancialsBioScrip exited second-quarter 2017 with cash and cash equivalents of $40.5 million, significantly above $15.9 million recorded at the end of the first quarter.2017 Guidance IntactBioScrip reiterated its guidance for adjusted EBITDA at the range of $45.0–$55.0 million for full-year 2017. This guidance incorporates the estimated adverse effect of the Cures Act legislation and the company's estimates regarding its contract with UnitedHealthcare. The company has updated its revenue outlook for 2017 to a range of $815.0–$835.0 million including the impact of the revised UnitedHealthcare contract on its 2017 revenues. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues of $855.2 million lies above the company’s guided range.Our TakeBioScrip exited the second quarter on a dismal note with wider-than-expected loss and revenues missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Management’s 2017 guidance, which includes the negative impact of the Cures Act legislation, also adds to our concerns.Nonetheless, we are encouraged by the company’s progress in the second quarter, courtesy of its new multi-faceted CORE plan which was adopted to improve the financial position. Further, the company achieved annualized supply chain improvement of roughly $20 million since the acquisition of Home Solutions’.

The upside has been primarily driven by a $1.9 million increase in Healthcare revenues owing to rising MCOT patients. However, this was partially offset by the $1-million impact from the slower Medicare rate effective Jan 1.Notably, this marked the 20th consecutive quarter of year-over-year revenue growth.Meanwhile, research revenues increased $1.6 million, led by imaging study volume growth and the full quarter impact of the acquisition of VirtualScopics, partially offset by lower cardiac revenues.

Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | BioTelemetry, Inc. QuoteMarginsGross profits increased 9.3% from the year-ago quarter to $35.9 million, primarily driven by increased revenues. The gross margin contracted 62 basis points (bps) due to the impact of the Medicare rate reduction and the 2016 acquisition which carries lower margins than the existing businesses.

The figure also outpaced the company’s guidance of $192–$194 million. The top line exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $194 million.

Thecompany particularly observed strong growth in both EndoPredict and GeneSight testing revenues along with a sequential rise in hereditary cancer volumes.On the flip side,unfavorable foreign currency translation continues to pose a threat for the company.

915,ALGN,"CVS Health Corporation’s (CVS  -  Free Report) second-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.33 were up a nominal 0.8% on a year-over-year basis. The quarter’s adjusted EPS also exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2 cents.Earnings performance was sluggish year over year on disappointing Retail/LTC numbers as well as weaker margins.Without the one-time adjustments, reported EPS from continuing operations in the first quarter surged 24.4% year over year to $1.07.Net revenue in the quarter increased 4.5% year over year to $45.7 billion and exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $45.3 billion by a close margin. Strong revenue growth in Pharmacy Services segment was partially offset by a decline in Retail/LTC performance in the quarter.CVS Health Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise CVS Health Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | CVS Health Corporation QuoteQuarter in Details Pharmacy Services revenues increased 9.5% to $32.3 billion in the reported quarter, driven by growth in the specialty pharmacy volume, higher pharmacy network claim volume as well as brand inflation. This was, however, partially offset by increased generic dispensing and price compression.Pharmacy network claims processed during the quarter climbed 10.3% to 376 million on a 30-day equivalent basis, backed by net new business growth. Also, the Mail Choice processed claim count was 65.6 million, up 5.2% on a 30-day equivalent basis on the continued adoption of Maintenance Choice offerings and a rise in specialty pharmacy claims.Revenues from CVS Health’s Retail/LTC dipped 2.2% year over year to $19.6 billion, primarily due to a 2.6% decrease in same store sales, continued reimbursement pressure and an increase in the generic dispensing rate.Front-end same-store sales were down 2.1% year over year. The shift of the Easter holiday to second-quarter 2017 from the first-quarter 2016 had a 75 bps positive impact on Front-end same-store sales. Front-store sales were, however, affected by soft customer traffic and efforts to rationalize promotional strategies, which were again partially offset by an increase in basket size.Pharmacy same-store sales also declined 2.8% in the reported quarter. Sales were affected approximately 410 bps due to recent generic drug introductions. Also, Pharmacy same-store prescription volumes were flat on a 30-day equivalent basis. This apart, marketplace changes that restricted CVS Pharmacy from participating in certain networks had a 460 bps negative impact on same store prescription volumes.The generic dispensing rate (the proportion of all generic prescriptions to total number of prescriptions dispensed) soared 130 bps to 87.2% at the Pharmacy Services segment and 150 bps to 87.6% at the Retail/LTC segment.While gross profit dropped 1.1% to $6.9 billion, gross margin contracted 86 bps to 15.2%. Total operating margin during the quarter contracted 76 bps to 4.6% on a 10.2% plunge in operating profit.CVS Health exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $2.2 billion compared with $2.3 billion at the end of first-quarter 2017. Year to date, net cash provided by operating activities was $5.5 billion, up 34.1% from the year-ago period.During the second quarter, CVS Health opened 27 new retail stores and shut three retail locations. Further, the company relocated 10 retail stores. As of Jun 30, 2017, CVS Health operated 9,700 retail stores, including pharmacies in Target stores across 49 U.S. states as well as the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and Brazil.2017 OutlookCVS Health has narrowed its 2017 adjusted EPS guidance to $5.83-$5.93 from the earlier band of $5.77-$5.93.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.87 is within this guided range. However, full-year operating cash flow guidance has been reiterated in the range of $7.7–$8.6 billion and free cash flow in the range of $6.0–$6.4 billion.For the third quarter, the company expects to deliver adjusted EPS of $1.47-$1.50. This projection takes into consideration the timing of the Medicare Part D operating profit between the third and fourth quarters, relative to the preceding year. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter is pegged at $1.62, way above the company’s projection.Our TakeCVS Health posted better-than-expected second-quarter results with both adjusted EPS and revenues beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, poor year-over-year Retail/LTC numbers along with margin debacle resulted in a dull earnings performance by the company in the quarter.Nonetheless, year-over-year growth on the top line was due to a strong Pharmacy Services segment, benefiting from the upside in the Specialty Pharmacy. An unimpressive bottom-line scenario also prompted the company to narrow its earnings outlook for 2017.Zacks Rank & Key PicksCVS Health has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A few better-ranked medical stocks are Edwards Lifesciences Corp. (EW  -  Free Report), INSYS Therapeutics, Inc. (INSY  -  Free Report) and Align Technology, Inc.

Adjusted EPS also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.73. The year-over-year upside in earnings was driven by strong revenue growth.Henry Schein’s reported net income in the second quarter came in at $139.3 million or $1.75 per share, reflecting year-over-year growth of 2.9% and 6.7%, respectively.Revenues in DetailHenry Schein reported revenues of $3.06 billion in the second quarter, up 6.5% year over year and also above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.05 billion. The year-over-year improvement came on the back of 7.7% growth in local currencies partially offset by a 1.2% decline owing to foreign currency exchange. At local currencies, internally generated sales increased 4.4% and acquisition growth was 3.3%.Henry Schein, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Henry Schein, Inc.

Internal growth at local currencies included 3.8% growth in North America and 2% rise internationally.The company's global Animal Health segment witnessed 4.4% improvement in revenues to $891.3 million. This includes 6.7% growth in local currencies and 2.3% decline related to foreign currency exchange. At local currencies, internally generated sales increased 5.8% and acquisition growth was 0.9%. The 5.8% internal growth in local currencies included 5.9% growth in North America and 5.7% growth internationally.Worldwide Medical revenues scaled 6.1% year over year to $571.4 million. Growth in local currencies was 6.2%, with a 0.1% decrease owing to adverse foreign exchange.Revenues from global Technology and Value-added Services grew 1.4% to $108.5 million. This included 2.8% growth in local currencies and a 1.4% decline related to foreign currency exchange. There was 0.6% contribution from acquisitions during the quarter under review.Margin Trends         Gross profit increased 4.7% to $839.2 million in the reported quarter. However, gross margin declined 50 basis points (bps) from the year-ago quarter to 27.4% due to a 7.2% rise in cost of sales, higher than the revenue growth rate.  Despite a 4.7% rise in selling, general & administrative expenses of $628.5 million, adjusted operating income improved 4.8% year over year to $210.7 million. Moreover, adjusted operating margin remained flat year over year at 6.9% in the reported quarter.Financial PositionHenry Schein exited second-quarter 2017 with cash and cash equivalents of $74.7 million, compared with $62.8 million at the end the first quarter. Year-to-date net cash provided by operating activities was $228.7 million, compared with $277.2 million in the year-ago period.During the quarter under review, the company bought back approximately 289,000 shares for almost $50 million. At the close of the second quarter, the company had $150 million authorized for future repurchases of its common stock.2017 EPS Guidance IntactHenry Schein reaffirmed its 2017 reported EPS guidance (except for the $0.04 litigation settlement expense). The company still expects EPS in the range of $7.17–$7.30, reflecting 8–10% growth from the 2016 EPS figure of $6.61.  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 adjusted EPS is $7.28, within the guided range.Our TakeHenry Schein exited second-quarter 2017 on a solid note with earnings and sales beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate. All four of its operating segments delivered strong year-over-year growth. The company’s strong share gains in both the North American and overseas markets along with strong revenues raise optimism.However, despite the better-than-expected earnings performance, we are disappointed with the company’s unchanged EPS guidance for 2017. Meanwhile, the year-over-year deterioration in Henry Schein’s gross and operating margin was due to higher cost of sales and expenses. Also, foreign currency fluctuations continued to mar the company’s financials.Zacks Rank & Key PicksHenry Schein has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

(OFIX  -  Free Report) reported second-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings per share (EPS) from continuing operations of 42 cents, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Adjusted earnings improved 5% year over year, primarily on strong sales growth at the company’s Biologics and Spine Fixation strategic business units (SBU).Excluding one-time items, net income in the second quarter came in at $4.7 million or 26 cents per share, showing a remarkable year-over-year improvement from a net loss of $6.3 million or 35 cents.Sales DetailsOrthofix’s second-quarter sales improved 4.7% (5.1% at constant exchange rate or CER) to $108.9 million. The figure also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $103 million by 5.7%.Sales were primarily driven by better-than-expected performance by all four of the company’s SBUs with significant contributions from Biologics and Spine Fixation.Orthofix International N.V.

QuoteSBU DetailsFor the second quarter, the company reported BioStim sales of $47.1 million, reflecting 5.4% (same at CER) growth from the prior-year quarter. Favorable NASS coverage recommendation, introduction of advanced spinal fusion therapy products and extensive sales force were the major drivers for the BioStim business.Biologics SBU sales in the quarter totaled $15.7 million, up 9.9% (same at CER) from the prior-year quarter. This was led by strong demand for Trinity Elite due to expanded distributor network, the reacquisition of the national hospital contract along with increased contributions from the national distributor partner.Extremity Fixationsales were $24.7 million in the reported quarter, showing a decline of 7.7% (6% at CER) from second-quarter 2016. However, after excluding planned subsidiary restructuring and the loss of sales due to the divestiture of a non-core business in 2016 impacts, the trailing 12-month growth rate of this business was 3.5% at CER.Orthofix reported Spine Fixation SBU sales of $21.4 million, reflecting 17.1% (same at CER) growth over the prior-year quarter. This can be attributed to strong growth in the U.S. and the strategic initiatives adoptedMarginsIn the second quarter, gross margin expanded 30 basis points (bps) to 78.7%. Solid top-line growth can be a major factor that might have contributed to the improved gross margin.Sales and marketing expenses rose 9.6% year over year to $50.5 millionowing to increased sales mix from newly added distributors in Biologics and elevated spending in Extremity Fixation to accelerate sales growth in the U.S. General and Administrative expenses were up 10.1% to $20.4 million led by increased investments to implement the strategic initiatives designed by the company, legal settlements and stock-based compensation. The company also witnessed a 1.3% rise in research and development expenses to $6.8 million. Accordingly, adjusted operating margin in the quarter contracted 250 bps to 7.3% as a result of increased operating expenses.Cash PositionOrthofix exited the second quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $44.3 million, compared with $41.7 million at the end of the first quarter. Year-to-date net cash provided by operating activities was $9.7 million, compared with $21.4 million in the year-ago period.Excluding capital expenditure of $8.6 million, free cash flow was $1.1 million in the reported quarter. This compares to capital expenditure of $10.4 million leading to free cash flow of $11 million in the year-ago period.Updated 2017 GuidanceBanking on a solid second-quarter performance,Orthofix has raised its full-year 2017 sales expectations to $422–$425 million from the previous $411–$415 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for full-year revenue is pegged at $414.3 million, below the guided range.Adjusted EPS expectations have also been raised to $1.54–$1.60 from $1.48–$1.58. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for full-year adjusted EPS stands at $1.54, in line with the low end of the company’s projected range.Our TakeThe company exited the second quarter on a mixed note, with sales beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate and earnings meeting the same. Per management, the top line was substantially driven by strength in Biologics and Spine Fixation businesses which is expected to continueon the back of improved performance by sales partners, expanded distributorship network and introduction of products.Moreover, the company seems to be upbeat on the encouraging response received by the Spinal-Stim and Cervical-Stim bone growth therapy devices launched earlier in 2017. Moreover, the company’s CETRA Anterior Cervical Plate has witnessed strong market adoption, resulting in sales of over $1 million in the first five months since the launch.Continuing with its slew of product developments and launches, the company recently launched RIVAL, a full line foot and ankle internal fixation system. Also, within its Extremity Fixation space, the company recently launched JuniOrtho, a new brand for orthopedic products, which currently accounts for roughly one-third of Extremity Fixation sales. Also, we believe that the raised full-year 2017 guidance is indicative of enhanced prospects.On the flip side, currency fluctuations, competitive landscape and macroeconomic headwinds continue to pose challenges for the company. Moreover, higher operating expenses are also a matter of concern for Orthofix. Also, the increased dependence on third –party for final distribution of products exposes the company to increased risks. Zacks Rank & Key PicksOrthofix has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The company still expects full-year revenues to be in line with fiscal 2017 revenues. The guidance for Plasma revenue growth is in the range of 3% to 5%, inclusive of the SEBRA divestiture which represented 1.4% of annual Plasma revenues. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 sales is pegged at $891.6 million.The company also expects 2018 adjusted EPS in the band of $1.55–$1.65. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.59 is within the guided range.Management continues to expect strong cash generating activity in fiscal 2018 with $140 million of cash on hand to fund business activities.Our TakeHaemonetics exited first-quarter fiscal 2018 on a mixed note, with earnings beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate and revenues missing the same. Despite the encouraging growth in the Plasma and Haemonetics Management franchises, the underperformance at the other franchise was quite a dampener.Meanwhile, the company’s strong cash position boosts investors’ confidence. The year-over-year increase in reported sales and gross margin buoys optimism.

919,ALGN,"Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc. (BIO  -  Free Report) reported second-quarter 2017 earnings of 17 cents per share, a huge decline from the year-ago earnings of 61 cents. The quarter’s figure also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 63 cents by a wide margin.Notably, net income in the second quarter was hit by lower sales, weaker gross profit, increased acquisition-related expenditures for new products and technology plus higher expense for implementation of new systems and operations in Europe. Net sales in the quarter came in at $504.7 million, down 2.3% year over year (down 1.6% at constant exchange rate or CER). Sales also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $515 million by 1.9%. The year-over-year fall in sales was largely due to a slowdown in productivity related to the recent go-live of the company’s global ERP system in Western Europe as well as a shift in sales into the first quarter in anticipation of the ERP deployment.Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc. QuoteQuarter in DetailOn a segmental basis, the Life Science segment’s net sales came in at $179.4 million, down 0.3% year over year (up 0.3% at CER). At CER, sales rose on the back of strong sales of Droplet Digital PCR (ddPCR) instruments and reagents, offset by a decrease in process chromatography media sales, plus some of the ERP-related disruption.Within Clinical Diagnostics, the company registered sales of $322.1 million, down 3.5% year over year (down 2.7% at CER). This decline resulted from a significant slowdown of European sales, especially in infectious disease and immunohematology products, directly related to the disruptions post go-live of the new ERP system.Gross margin of 54.1% during the second quarter was down 7 basis points (bps) year over year on a 2.5% decline in gross profits. Adjusted operating loss in the reported quarter was $2.35 million compared with the operating profit of $24.9 million in the year-ago quarter.The company exited the second quarter with cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of 717.4 million compared with $844 million at the end of 2016. Year to date, net cash provided by operating activities was $6.2 million compared with $69.7 million in the year-ago period.2017 Guidance Despite a dismal second-quarter performance, Bio-Rad continues to expect organic sales growth of approximately 4% at CER for the full year. This growth rate assumes recovery of a substantial portion of the $15-$17 million of ERP-related sales disruption that took place in the second quarter.With lower-than-anticipated operating profit in the first half of 2017 and including the addition of RainDance Technologies, the company has lowered its currency-neutral operating margin projection for the full year to a range of 6--6.5% from the earlier guidance of 7%.Bottom LineBio-Rad posted a disappointing quarterly show with both earnings and sales significantly lagging the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Sales growth was majorly hampered by a slower productivity resulting from ERP deployment in Western Europe as well as lower-than-expected sales in the process media business. However, the company reiterated its organic growth expectation indicating chances of recovery.Zacks Rank & Key PicksBio-Rad has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Currently, the stock is up 15.4%, better than the 12.1% gain of the broader industry.Cardiovascular Systems delivered remarkable fourth-quarter 2017 results, with earnings and revenues beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate.

Also, the one-year results from the LIBERTY 360 study is to be presented at the 2017 Amputation Prevention Symposium (AMP).On the flip side, the company operates in the competitive medical device industry, which gets significantly affected by product introductions.

Per management, AUGMENT had an impressive quarter with improvement in average daily revenue when compared to the first quarter, whereas the core biologics portfolio continued to be challenging.

923,ALGN,"Goleta, CA-based Inogen, Inc. (INGN  -  Free Report) reported second-quarter 2017 earnings of 38 cents per share, up 5.6% year over year, which comfortably beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 28 cents and the year-ago figure of 36 cents.The upside was driven by roughly 17.5% growth in revenues, which totaled $64.1 million, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of almost $60 million.Q2 DetailsSales revenues surged 27.3% to $58 million, while rental revenues declined 32.3% to $6.1 million.Business-to-business: Business-to-business domestic sales were up 32.2% on a year-over-year basis to almost $21.2 million, primarily driven by traditional home medical equipment provider purchases and the consistent strength of the private label partner.Inogen, Inc Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Inogen, Inc Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Inogen, Inc QuoteMeanwhile, business-to-business International sales rose around 13.9% to almost $14.9 million on the back of solid demand from the company’s partner’s in Europe.Direct-to-consumer: Direct-to-consumer domestic sales advanced 33.3% to almost $21.9 million.However, direct-to-consumer rental sales fell 32.3% to $6.1 million. This decline can be attributed to decreased rental reimbursement rates and the company’s increased strategic focus on sales.Margin DetailsIn the reported quarter, Inogen registered a gross margin of 49.2% (as a percentage of revenues), up 120 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis.Meanwhile, sales gross margin expanded 240 bps in the quarter to 51.8%, as a percentage of revenues. Per management, an increase in sales gross margin was driven by lower material costs resulting in decreased cost of goods sold in the quarter.Rental gross margin was 25.0% in the reported quarter, much lower than 41.0% in the second quarter of 2016. This was primarily driven by lower net revenue per rental patient led by fallen reimbursement rate. However, this decline in rental gross margin was partially offset by decreased cost of rental revenue particularly led by lower depreciation and servicing costs.Adjusted EBITDA rose 5.6% to $14.4 million on a year-over-year basis.GuidanceBanking on solid performance in the second quarter, Inogen raised its 2017 revenue and adjusted net income guidance. Moreover, the company narrowed its full-year adjusted EBITDA guidance.Inogen projects revenues in the range of $239–$243 million, higher than the previous range of $233–$239 million. This represents year-over-year growth of 17.8%–19.8%, up from the previously provided range of 14.9%–17.8%. The company expects rental revenue to decline in 2017, courtesy of lower average rental revenue per patient and continued focus on sales.Adjusted EBITDA is now projected in the band of $48–$50 million, compared to $46–$50 projected previously, thereby presenting an increase of 10.6% to 15.2% from 6%–15.2% year over year.Inogen expects adjusted net income in the range of $25--$27 million, up from the previously provided range of $22–$24 million. This represents 21.8%--31.6% year-over-year growth compared to the previous range of 7.2%–17%.Our TakeInogen reported a stellar second quarter of 2017, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate for both the counts. The company witnessed solid growth in revenues and adjusted earnings on a year-over-year basis. In our view, solid domestic and international business-to-business sales has driven the stellar quarterly performance. In fact, the company expects direct-to-consumer sales to be its fastest growing channel, followed by domestic business-to-business sales in the coming quarters, with solid focus in Europe. In this context, the company recently signed a lease for its expansion site in Ohio to accelerate growth in domestic direct-to-consumer sales channel.Moreover, during the second quarter, the company took a series of strategic initiatives to strengthen its product offerings and market position. In this regard, the company successfully integrated MedSupport Systems B.V. acquired in May 2017.Continuing with the slew of product developments and launches, the company received EC Certificate for its One G4 product in Jun 2017.Per management, the company also effectively launched its new customer relationship management (CRM) system in Jun 2017. This latest development is expected to enhance the productivity across sales, billing, and customer service teams in the long term.On the flip side, declining rental revenues raise concern, which might mar the company’s prospects. Moreover, since the company generates a significant portion of its revenues from the International market, volatile foreign exchange rate will always continue to pose a concern for the company.Zacks Rank & Key PicksInogen currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked medical stocks are Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (EW  -  Free Report), INSYS Therapeutics, Inc.

924,ALGN,"On Aug 3, 2017, we issued an updated research report on San Diego, CA-based Illumina Inc. (ILMN  -  Free Report), a company providing tools and integrated systems for the analysis of genetic variation and function.Illumina exited the second quarter on a solid note, with both earnings and revenues beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The top line was strong with new product launches including the VeriSeq NIPT Solution in Europe and the strength of NovaSeq. More good news is that the rate of NIPT adoption is increasing outside the U.S.Notably, over the last three months, Illumina has been trading above the broader industry. The stock has grown 4.8% in this period compared with a 3.9% gain of the broader industry. The company’s raised guidance is also encouraging enough to indicate that this bullish trend will continue in the coming period.Also, demand for NovaSeq surpassed the company’s expectations with orders beating forecast over 30%. More than 230 NovaSeq instruments have been ordered since its launch in January. We are also looking forward to GRAIL, Illumina’s own-developed company, focused on the cancer screening market.Within clinical markets, demand from customers undergoing oncology testing remains robust. We are currently looking forward to the performance of the Extended RAS Panel, slated for launch in the third quarter. Significantly in June, the company announced an FDA approval receipt for the Extended RAS companion diagnostic kit (as the Class III PMA).On the flip side, weak margins owing to NovaSeq’s launch, higher array services revenues and product mix within sequencing consumables will continue to act as deterrents. Also, National Institutes of Health (NIH) funding issue and a tough competitive landscape are other few concerns to deal with.Zacks Rank & Key PicksIllumina currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some of the better-ranked medical stocks are Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (EW  -  Free Report), INSYS Therapeutics, Inc.

The company currently expects revenues in the range of $3.04–$3.05 billion from the earlier band of $3.05–$3.08 billion. This new outlook reflects annualized growth of 7.3–7.8% (previously it was 7.7–8.7%).

The company’s strong cash position is another encouraging factor.However, we are disappointed with the decrease of revenues at the company’s Diagnostics segment. The blood screening divestiture is expected to mar the company’s growth momentum in the days ahead.

Joint product development and an equity financing arrangement are also part of the agreement.Intuitive Surgical, Inc. Price and Consensus  Intuitive Surgical, Inc. Price and Consensus | Intuitive Surgical, Inc. QuoteAlso, the company posted an impressive second quarter. Both earnings and revenues registered a year-over-year increase in the quarter. The company also witnessed growth in all the segments.

931,ALGN,"Medical device major Medtronic plc (MDT  -  Free Report) is focusing on expanding its core Coronary and Structural Heart business. Keeping in line with this, the company recently announced a global randomized clinical trial to evaluate one-month dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) in patients implanted with the Resolute Onyx Drug-Eluting Stent (DES) during percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) procedures.DAPT is a combination of aspirin and anti-clotting medication. Notably, Resolute Onyx DES is the first DES which works on the Core Wire Technology, an evolution of Continuous Sinusoid Technology (CST).Resolute Onyx DES provides enhanced visibility to surgeons, delivering superior clinical performance.According to Medtronic, the RESOLUTE ONYX ONE-MONTH DAPT study aims to help inform DAPT guidelines for newer-generation DES that currently support bare-metal stents (BMS) for stable ischemic heart disease patients who might require a shorter dual antiplatelet regimen. The study will also demonstrate Medtronic’s clinical investment to provide relevant DAPT evidence to physicians for both current and previous generation DES.DAPT therapy guidelines vary geographically as well as by patient presentation. Duration of DAPT evaluation is made based on individuals along with clinical judgment, evaluating the benefit/risk ratio, product labeling, and patient preference. The study will be based on approximately 2,000 patients worldwide.As per the company’s press release, the RESOLUTE ONYX ONE-MONTH DAPT study outcomes will build on the RESOLUTE Pooled DAPT Interruption analysis that showed no increased risk of stent thrombosis with DAPT interruption or discontinuation after a month.Taking into consideration the huge and growing global coronary stent market, we believe the latest initiative by Medtronic is well timed. Per a report by Transparency Market Research, the global coronary stents market is expected to see a CAGR of 6.6% from 2013 to 2019.Recent Developments on Coronary StentRecently, Medtronic announced that DES has met its primary endpoint of Target Lesion Failure (TLF) at one year for the treatment of coronary artery disease in extra-small vessels.Also, of late, the Resolute Onyx DES received FDA approval.Further, post the successful launch of Resolute Onyx DES in the U.S. in May 2017, Medtronic has started selling it in the Japan market from Jul 10, as per a Cardiovascular Business report released on Jul 7.To note, over the last six months, Medtronic has outperformed the S&P 500 Index. As per the latest share price movement, the company has gained 7.2%, compared to the S&P 500’s 5.2% gain.Zacks Rank & Key PicksMedtronic currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

932,ALGN,"On Aug 16, we issued an updated research report on Haemonetics Corporation (HAE  -  Free Report), a Braintree, MA-based leading provider of blood management solutions to customers encompassing blood and plasma collectors, hospitals and health care providers globally. The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).For the past six months, Haemonetics has been trading above the broader industry. The stock till now has rallied 14.1% compared with the broader industry’s 11.7% increase.The company exited first-quarter fiscal 2018 on a mixed note, with earnings beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate but revenues missing the same. However, the year-over-year increase in reported sales and gross margin buoys optimism. Market is also upbeat about Haemonetics’ encouraging growth in both Plasma and Haemonetics Management franchises. The company swung to operating income in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 from losses in the year-ago quarter.Haemonetics Corporation Price and Consensus Haemonetics Corporation Price and Consensus | Haemonetics Corporation QuoteHaemonetics has been witnessing a strong flourish in its Plasma franchise for quite some time now. Management has also maintained high confidence in the continued growth of its commercial plasma collection business.In the quarter, North America Plasma disposables revenues increased 6%. Growth continued to be led by a strong end-market demand for plasma-derived biopharmaceuticals.The company’s Hospital business is also progressing well. The TEG line of products has gained popularity worldwide. The TEG 5000 is approved of for a broad set of indications in all its top markets. The TEG 6s and TEG Manager are sanctioned for the same set of indications across Europe, Australia and Japan.On the flip side, the company has been witnessing sluggish revenue growth at the Blood Center franchise, significantly affecting Haemonetics’ results over the past few quarters. Management also doesn’t expect any early recovery in the Blood Center’s outcomes.Macroeconomic uncertainty continues to pose a challenge for Haemonetics. Management also anticipates slower-than-expected product adoption by customers which might reduce revenues and profits. Also, currency fluctuations and a stiff competition continue to hamper the stock.Other Key PicksA few better-rankedmedical stocks are Edwards Lifesciences Corp.

933,ALGN,"On Aug 14, we issued an updated research report on Palo Alto, CA-based Varian Medical Systems Inc. (VAR  -  Free Report). The company is the world’s leading provider of radiotherapy, radiosurgery, proton therapy and brachytherapy for treating cancer and other medical conditions.Varian Medical had an unimpressive run on the bourse over the last one month, trading below the industry in terms of price performance. A glimpse at the share price movement reveals that Varian Medical’s shares have lost 6.4%, comparing unfavorably with 3.0% decline of the industry.Looking forward, Varian Medical's oncology and Proton therapy business' growth prospects remain impressive. The company is addressing both the tier 1 and mid-tier markets through its Edge, Truebeam and VitalBeam, Halcyon products. The company is winning contracts, not only in the Americas but also in the emerging international markets, which is a huge positive. We believe that China and Africa present significant top-line growth opportunity in the near term. The company is opening new offices in Africa and the Middle East, which will provide growth opportunities in the region.Varian Medical operates in a technology-driven environment where success depends on innovation and frequent product updates. The company has been successful on the R&D front as evident from year-over-year growth in its top line. The company has approximately $1 billion revenue opportunity from its various Oncology and Imaging Component products over the next five years.  The varied offerings include TrueBeam and Edge platforms, InSightive Analytics, Qumulate QA and RapidPlan knowledge-based treatment planning. We believe that Varian Medical’s innovative product pipeline will continue to drive growth over the long term.Apart from enjoying a dominant market share in conventional radiotherapy, we believe that proton therapy also holds significant promise for Varian Medical. This is because ProBeam Compact proton therapy system is superior to other external beam radiotherapies in precisely locating cancerous tumors and causes lesser side effects to surrounding tissues. Proton therapy system uses the same interface used by the company in its TrueBeam platform.Finally the company’s strong overseas presence is expected to enable it to leverage this opportunity in emerging markets. In line with growing demand for cancer treatment in overseas markets, Varian Medical’s sales, in Europe, Africa and particularly Asia, are growing at a faster rate than in the domestic market.On the flip side, unfavorable currency translation continues to be a major dampener for the stock. Management fears that further strengthening of the dollar against foreign currencies will lead to deteriorating operating results.Intense competition as well as the possibility that Varian Medical’s new test might not generate meaningful profits to outweigh the costs associated with its development, continues to raise concern.Zacks Rank and Key PicksVarian Medical carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked medical stocks are Edwards Lifesciences Corp. (EW  -  Free Report), Steris Plc (STE  -  Free Report) and Align Technology, Inc. (ALGN  -  Free Report).

934,ALGN,"Civitas Solutions, Inc. (CIVI  -  Free Report) reported third-quarter fiscal 2017 adjusted earnings per share (EPS) from continuing operations of 20 cents, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. Adjusted earnings improved 53.8% year over year, primarily on strong sales growth from the company’s Post-Acute Specialty Rehabilitation Services (SRS) and Adult Day Health (ADH) services.Revenue DetailsCivitas Solutions’ third-quarter revenues rose 5.2% year over year to $372.3 million. The figure, however, lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $379 million by 1.8%.The company gained $11.7 million from organic growth and $6.7 million from acquisitions in the third quarter.  Per management, organic growth was largely driven by strong performance by Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (I/DD). Also, the company acquired seven companies in the reported quarter with total annual revenues of $23.2 million. Moreover, the deals mostly covered I/DD, SRS and ADH service lines.Segmental DetailsFor the third quarter, the company reported I/DD revenues of $243.5 million, reflecting 4.1% growth from the prior-year quarter. SRS service revenues in the quarter totaled $77.8 million, up 5.8% from the prior-year quarter.At-risk youth (ARY) servicesrevenues came in at $35.4 million in the reported quarter, flat with the third-quarter 2016 level. Civitas Solutionsreported ADH revenues of $15.7 million, reflecting 39.7% growth over the prior-year quarter.Margin DetailsIn the reported quarter, Civitas Solutions registered a gross margin of 21.4%, down 100 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis owing to a 6.5% rise in cost of revenue to $292.5 million.General and Administrative expenses declined 5.8% to $40.4 million led by enhanced cost efficiencies under the company’s cost restructuring program. Accordingly, adjusted operating margin in the quarter expanded 30 bps to 10.6%.GuidanceCivitas Solutions lowered the high end of its fiscal 2017 revenue guidance.The company projects revenues in the range of $1.48–$1.49 billion, lower than the previous range of $1.48–$1.52 billion. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $1.49 billion, at the high end of the company’s updated guided range.Our TakeCivitas Solutions exited the third quarter on a mixed note with better-than-expected earnings and a revenue miss.Nonetheless, we are encouraged by the company’s progress in SRS and ADH, two of its fastest growing businesses. Moreover, the company is witnessing steady contributions from its strategy to grow organically and through acquisitions.However, a tweaked fiscal 2017 guidance raises concern. Also, even though the company seems to be implementing its cost restructuring program efficiently, weak margins may continue to mar its financials.Peer Earnings PerformancesMedical stocks that have performed well this earnings season are Edwards Lifesciences Corp.

935,ALGN,"On Aug 11, we issued an updated research report on Salt Lake City, UT-based molecular diagnostics provider, Myriad Genetics, Inc. (MYGN  -  Free Report). The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).For the past three months, Myriad has been trading above the broader industry. The company has rallied 24.7%, compared with the industry’s 3.7% gain.Myriad ended fiscal 2017 on a solid note, with its fourth-quarter numbers exceeding the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The company particularly observed strong growth in EndoPredict and GeneSight testing revenues. Also, Myriad witnessed a third consecutive quarter of rise in hereditary cancer volumes. Also, it received provincial reimbursement in Quebec for EndoPredict.Notably, at the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) meeting held in June in Spain, Crescendo Bioscience, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Myriad, released new data from a meta-analysis of clinical studies. The data has demonstrated the Vectra DA test’s ability to predict a joint damage.The same month, the company announced that its BRACAnalysis CDx companion diagnostic test has successfully identified BRCA-mutated patients with HER2- metastatic breast cancer in the OlympiAD trial, who have responded to treatment with olaparib better than standard chemotherapy.Myriad’s collaborations with AstraZeneca and BeiGene for development of companion diagnostics also raise optimism. Moreover, Myriad continues to make progress with its kit-based versions of Prolaris and myPath Melanoma in the international market and expects to file for CE Mark for Prolaris by 2018.Moreover, the company has introduced its ‘Elevate 2020’ program that targets to achieve $50 million of incremental operating income by fiscal 2020. Per management, the company has selected the projects that are anticipated to deliver $17 million of operating income in fiscal 2018 and another $24 million in fiscal 2019.On the flip side, unfavorable currency translation continues to be a major dampener for the stock. Management fears that further strengthening of the dollar against foreign currencies will lead to deteriorating operating results.Intensifying competition as well as the possibility that Myriad’s new test might not generate meaningful profits to outweigh the costs associated with its development continues to raise concern.Zacks Rank and Key PicksSome better-ranked medical stocks are Edwards Lifesciences Corp.

936,ALGN,"On Aug 14, we issued an updated research report on Ohio-based STERIS plc (STE  -  Free Report) – a manufacturer and marketer of infection prevention, decontamination, microbial reduction along with surgical and gastrointestinal support products and services. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).STERIS posted better-than-expected results in first-quarter fiscal 2018 with both earnings and revenues beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, the year-over-year decline in revenues is dampening.On a positive note, organic growth performance was strong across all segments. Further, growth in free cash flow reserve is indicative of the company’s strong cash balance. Also, gross and operating margin expanded year over year. Recently, the company made a couple of organizational changes to serve customers in a better way. We expect this move to enhance the company’s cost structure as well. Over the last three months, the stock has gained 13.1%, which outperformed the 1.1% decline of the broader industry.However, we note that the government and insurance companies’ consistent efforts to curb healthcare costs have been putting pressure on the stock for quite some time. We are also concerned about the current customer consolidation scenario which will continue to affect the company, unless checked immediately. The competitive landscape and weak cost reduction initiatives are other overhangs.Other Key PicksOther top-ranked medical stocks are Edwards Lifesciences Corp.

937,ALGN,"Similar to wise buying decisions, exiting certain underperformers at the right time helps maximize portfolio returns. Selling off losers can be difficult, but if both the share price and estimates are falling, it could be time to get rid of the security before more losses hit your portfolio.One such stock that you may want to consider dropping is Brookdale Senior Living Inc. (BKD  -  Free Report), which has witnessed a significant price decline in the past four weeks, and it has seen negative earnings estimate revisions for the current quarter and the current year. A Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) further confirms weakness in BKD.A key reason for this move has been the negative trend in earnings estimate revisions. For the full year, we have seen one estimate moving down in the past 30 days, compared with no upward revisions. This trend has caused the consensus estimate to trend lower, going from $2.04 a share a month ago to its current level of $1.74.Also, for the current quarter, Brookdale Senior Living has seen one downward estimate revisions versus no revisions in the opposite direction, dragging the consensus estimate down to 42 cents a share from 51 cents over the past 30 days.  The stock also has seen some pretty dismal trading lately, as the share price has dropped 14.0% in the past month.Brookdale Senior Living Inc.

938,ALGN,"On Aug 11, we issued an updated research report on Chesterbrook, PA-based AmerisourceBergen Corporation (ABC  -  Free Report) – one of the world’s largest pharmaceutical services companies. The company focuses on providing drug distribution and related services to reduce health care costs and improve patient outcome. The company currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).AmerisourceBergen had an unimpressive run on the bourse over the last one month, trading below the industry in terms of price performance. A glimpse at the share price movement reveals that AmerisourceBergen’s shares has lost 13.9%, comparing unfavorably with the 5.4% decline of the broader industry.The unfavorable performance was led by pricing pressure in the generic drug space and lackluster guidance for the full year. AmerisourceBergen expects fiscal 2017 revenue growth in the range of 5.5% to 6.5%, significantly lower than the previous 6.5% to 8% band. The company expects brand drug inflation in the range of 7% to 9%.AmerisourceBergen took over PharMEDium Healthcare Holdings for $2.58 billion back in 2015. We believe that the temporary slowdown in PharMEDium growth will mar AmerisourceBergen's bottom line in the coming quarters. Notably, the company aims to boost its investments to enhance PharMEDium's QA and QC (quality assurance and quality control) systems in terms of product quality and patient safety. Although this lends AmerisourceBergen a competitive advantage over the long haul, this might result in a bottom-line headwind for the business in fiscal 2017.Lackluster performance in the hepatitis C revenue segment is another concern. In this regard, AmerisourceBergen witnessed a significant negative revenue impact from the declining sales at the segment in the second quarter. Revenues improved only 4% to $37.1 billion in the quarter, which might have been around 5.5% without the adverse impact of the hepatitis C segment.Cutthroat competition in the niche space is an added concern. AmerisourceBergen operates in a highly competitive pharmaceutical distribution and related health care services market. The company’s primary competitors include Cardinal Health (CAH  -  Free Report) and McKesson (MCK  -  Free Report) along with national generic and regional distributors.The generic industry is facing consolidation of customers and manufacturers, globalization and increasing quality along with regulatory challenges. The company also faces competition from manufacturers, chain drugstores, specialty distributors and packaging and health care technology companies.A better-ranked stock in the broader medical sector is Align Technology, Inc.

940,ALGN,"Investors always seek a winning strategy. However, finding such a strategy is easier said than done. When markets are shaken by widespread global growth concerns, it is difficult for even an insightful investor to come up with a foolproof approach.No matter how disciplined and systematic investors are, equity market volatility will always manage to get the better of them. While a few lucky ones rake in the moolah, others fall victim to ad hoc strategies.One could resort to commonly used techniques to find beaten down stocks that have the potential to recover faster than others. However, even such investment choices bear the risk of disappointment. Particularly, one could be stuck in a value trap if the hidden weaknesses in selected stock are not identified.So, wouldn’t it be safer to look for stocks that are winners currently and have the potential to gain further?Here’s how to execute it:One should primarily look for stocks that have recently been witnessing price increase. Actually, stocks seeing price strength recently have a high chance of carrying the momentum forward.If a stock is continuously moving higher, there must be a good reason for the rise or else it probably would have fallen like the losers.

This lowers the risk of choosing stocks that may have drawn attention due to the overwhelming performance of the overall market in a very short period.Zacks Rank 1: No matter whether market conditions are good or bad, stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) have a proven history of outperformance.

941,ALGN,"On Aug 10, we issued an updated research report on Elmsford, NY-based BioScrip, Inc. (BIOS  -  Free Report). The company is a leading Infusion Service provider and strives to deliver cost-effective programs to patients. The stock currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Over the last three months, BioScrip has been trading above the broader industry. The stock has gained 78.0%, comparing favorably with the 4.9% decline of the broader industry.BioScrip exited the second quarter with wider-than-expected adjusted net loss and a revenue miss. Management’s unimpressive 2017 guidance, which includes the negative impact of the Cures Act legislation, adds to our concerns. Nonetheless, the market is upbeat about BioScrip’s announcement to continue to offer certain core product lines to UnitedHealthcare. Also, stiff competition raises concern.On a positive note, we are encouraged by the company’s recent progress, courtesy of its new multi-faceted CORE plan which was adopted to improve the financial position. Further, the company achieved annualized supply chain improvement of roughly $20 million since the acquisition of Home Solutions.BioScrip currently operates in an attractive market with favorable industry dynamics and positive fundamentals. In particular, market forces, developing patient management technologies and the aging U.S. population are driving growth opportunities for home health service providers like BioScrip. With the healthcare landscape rapidly changing, the company is focused on boosting its core Infusion Services platform through a clinically-focused and customer-orientated model.Other Key PicksOther top-ranked medical stocks are Edwards Lifesciences Corp.

943,ALGN,"I run a portfolio at Zacks called TAZR Trader, which stands for Technical Analysis plus the Zacks Rank.Every week I screen for stocks that get the top grades from the Zacks Rank for their earnings momentum and then I analyze the chart and institutional sponsorship for the stock.Four names that passed the test early this year I’ve actually held onto for a while. And I plan to keep holding on to core positions while trading their swings… all the way to $200 during this bull market.There’s a video attached to this article with all their charts and the prime buying zones you want to be watching.But if you just want to read about them first, along with my rationale for their unstoppable profit and price trends, here are the 4 stocks that make it into my $200 Club…Align Technology (ALGN  -  Free Report): The maker of the Invisalign clear “teeth straighteners” continues to take the world, thousands of smiles at a time. American dental professionals love the product and as more consumers become aware of the option, Align’s market share dominates.Plus, the international growth should see 25%+ for years to come. Just think of the market potential for clear aligners in China and India!Alibaba (BABA  -  Free Report): The Amazon of China just keeps surprising Wall Street with its growth in over a dozen business units, from ecommerce and the cloud to media and finance.Jack Ma came to the US in June and invited small businesses to discover Alibaba as the gateway to selling their products and services to the largest middle class on the planet. Years of dominate growth lie ahead that will justify the valuation.Lam Research (LRCX  -  Free Report): This premier “arms dealer” for chip makers is on a big roll because the demand for its wafer fabrication equipment (WFE) is almost beyond traditional cycles right now. By that I mean that the cloud, mobile, autonomous cars, and machine learning/automation are creating a secular wave of demand that will run well into 2019.Speaking of machine learning and AI, I could easily argue that NVIDIA (NVDA  -  Free Report) is headed to $200. But I sold too early and can’t justify an entry here above $160. So I say, buy the dips in the affordable Lam instead of chasing the pricey NVIDIA.Facebook (FB  -  Free Report): This business model is so misunderstood by average investors. Zuckerberg and his teams copied what was working for Google with Adwords and created a whole new revolution for small business advertising. The ability to target and re-target very specific audiences and then have access to analytics that show you how to boost and maintain a positive ROI on your ad spend will grow the digital advertising juggernaut to over $38 billion in revenues this year.And that growth is not stealing from Google – it’s simply expanding the pie of revolutionary global reach for tens of thousands of businesses, from the solo entrepreneur to the medium-size industrial, fashion or tech company.Plus, this growth is going to get even harder to understand by this time next year when Facebook unveils its next software and hardware innovations to help consumers find more of what they want from advertisers by using augmented reality (AR) technology to shop, learn, share, and play. Zuck didn’t buy Oculus Rift VR technology for $2 billion just to entertain gamers.And they didn’t hire the former chief engineer of DARPA, Regina Dugan, to create new space age toys for 2 billion monthly active users (MAU). They need to feed the advertising machine to keep Wall Street happy and they know it.Something big is coming from Facebook. Mark my words.For a broader discussion of this topic and how Apple is also “up to stuff” in their secret engineering labs, check out my recent podcast…Why the Apple Ecosphere Could Own Augmented RealityTo see the 4 charts of the $200 Club, be sure to watch the video attached to this article.And be sure to buy the dips in these stocks. You will thank me later… maybe by this time next year.Disclosure: I own shares of ALGN, BABA, LRCX, and FB for the Zacks TAZR Trader.Kevin Cook is a Senior Stock Strategist for Zacks Investment Research where he followed Broadcom (formerly Avago) from $70 to. One Simple Trading IdeaSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.

944,ALGN,"Genomic Health, Inc. (GHDX  -  Free Report) reported second-quarter 2017 loss per share of 8 cents, reflecting an improvement from the year-ago quarter’s loss of 18 cents. The quarter’s number is however wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 6 cents.Net loss in the reported quarter was $2.7 million, as compared with net loss of $6.1 million in the year-ago quarter.Revenues in DetailTotal revenue in the quarter rose 4.3% year over year to $85.5 million, slightly below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $86 million. Growth in the U.S. and international markets drove the top line.Geographically, second-quarter product revenues in the U.S. improved 4.02% to $72.4 million. The U.S. product revenue growth was fueled by invasive breast cancer revenue growth of 1.9% as well as 78.3% rise in Prostate test revenues. International product revenues were $13.1 million in the reported quarter, up 6%, and 10% on a CER basis.During the quarter, the company delivered more than 31,550 Oncotype DX test results, up 9% year over year.Genomic Health, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Genomic Health, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Genomic Health, Inc. QuoteMargin TrendIn the quarter under review, Genomic Health’s gross margin expanded 300 basis points (bps) year over year to 83.9%. Apart from significant top-line growth, the improvement in gross margin was led by an 11.5% decline in cost of product revenues to $13.8 million.Genomic Health also witnessed a 4.6% rise in operating expenses to $74.8 million owing to a 7.4% increase in selling and marketing expenses to $40.7 million and a 6% rise in research and development expenses to $15.8 million. However, general and administrative expenses declined 0.5% to $18.4 million.In the reported quarter, Genomic Health reported an operating loss of $3.1 million, showing a 40.4% year-over-year improvement from an operating loss of $5.2 million a year ago.Financial UpdateGenomic Health exited second-quarter 2017 with cash and cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities (including a corporate equity investment) of $109.8 million, reflecting a slight improvement from $94.4 million recorded at the end of the first quarter.Our TakeGenomic Health exited the second quarter of 2017 on a disappointing note. We are concerned about the company’s rising operating expenses as well.Nevertheless, we are encouraged by the decline in cost of sales which led to solid gross margin expansion.Management noted that strong demand for Genomic Health’s Oncotype tests in the second quarter of 2017 was partly on account of growth in its U.S. and International prostate and global invasive breast business. Specifically, in invasive breast cancer, the Oncotype DX test proved to be the company’s only test to predict all major short- and long-term outcomes. In this context, in Jun 2017, the company announced results from eight studies based on its Oncotype DX tests at the 2017 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting in Chicago. Per management, results confirm the efficiency of the Oncotype DX tests in predicting clinically meaningful endpoints and outcomes across multiple cancer types. We are also looking forward to the company’s newly initiated Clinical Utility Program for select centers in the U.S. to prepare for the commercial launch of the Oncotype DX AR-V7 Nucleus Detect test in collaboration with Epic Sciences.On the flip side, management has not issued any guidance, which is discouraging. Moreover, the company’s sole reliance on the Breast Oncotype DX test is a concern.Zacks Rank & Key PicksGenomic Health currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). A few better-ranked medical stocks are Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (EW  -  Free Report), INSYS Therapeutics, Inc. (INSY  -  Free Report) and Align Technology, Inc. (ALGN  -  Free Report), with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.INSYS Therapeutics has a long-term expected earnings growth rate of 20%.

945,ALGN,"Illumina, Inc. (ILMN  -  Free Report) reported adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of 82 cents in the second quarter of 2017, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 20.6%. The reported figure also surpassed the company’s guided range of 65–70 cents. Adjusted earnings, however, lagged the year-ago number by 4.7%.Including one-time items, the company reported EPS of 87 cents compared with 82 cents a year ago.RevenuesIn the reported quarter, Illumina's revenues grew 10.3% year over year to $662 million, exceeding the company’s expectations of approximately 7%. Moreover, the top line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.3%.Per management, top-line growth in the second quarter can be attributed to strong uptake of sequencing consumables and microarrays. Moreover, the NovaSeq platform continued to drive growth with more than 230 orders since the launch in Jan 2017.Product revenues (82.0% of total revenue) increased 6.5% year over year to $543 million. Service and Other (18%) revenues were up 32.2% year over year to $119 million.Illumina, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Illumina, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Illumina, Inc. QuoteOperational UpdateIllumina's adjusted gross margin came in at 67.1%, reflecting a contraction of 540 basis points (bps) year over year owing to NovaSeq introduction, higher array services revenues and product mix within sequencing consumables. Excluding amortization of acquired intangible assets and including stock-based compensation expenses, adjusted gross margin was 67.0%, highlighting a contraction of 540 bps from the prior-year period.Research and development expenses were up 4% year over year to $130 million and selling, general & administrative expenses rose 14.2% to $169 million. Consequently, the adjusted operating margin of 23.1% reflected a decline of 570 bps from the year-ago period, primarily due to increased investments in GRAIL and Helix.Financial UpdateIllumina exited the second quarter with cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1.89 billion, up from $1.78 billion in the first quarter. Year-to-date net cash provided by operating activities was $346 million, compared with $341 million in the year-ago period.2017 GuidanceBanking on the solid second-quarter performance, Illumina has raised its full-year 2017 revenue growth expectations to 12% from the earlier provided range of 10–12%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for full-year 2017 revenues is pegged at $2.65 billion.The company continues to expect adjusted EPS in the band of $3.60–$3.70 (unchanged from earlier guidance). The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for Illumina’s 2017 bottom line stands at $3.63, near the low end of the guided range.Our TakeIllumina exited the second quarter on a solid note, with both earnings and revenues beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate. While the top line was strong on several product launches including the VeriSeq NIPT Solution in Europe and the strength in NovaSeq, the bottom line was impacted by margin pressure.We are currently looking forward to the performance of the Extended RAS Panel that is slated for launch in the third quarter. Notably, the company announced the receipt of FDA approval for this test next-generation sequencing kit in Jun 2017. Also, Illumina’s recently developed venture for the cancer screening market – GRAIL – has started to deliver positive news.On the flip side, weak margins owing to NovaSeq launch, higher array services revenues and product mix within sequencing consumables will continue to act as deterrents. Also, a tough competitive landscape is a concern. We are also apprehensive about issues pertaining to NIH funding.Zacks Rank & Other Key PicksIllumina currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Other top-ranked medical stocks are Mesa Laboratories, Inc. (MLAB  -  Free Report), INSYS Therapeutics, Inc. (INSY  -  Free Report) and Align Technology, Inc. (ALGN  -  Free Report).

Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  ResMed Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | ResMed Inc. QuoteGeographically, revenues in the Americas rose 8% year over year to $350.2 million, which included Brightree revenues of $36.2 million. Excluding Brightree, revenues in the Americas totaled $314 million, reflecting a 6% increase over the prior-year quarter. This solid result was fueled by growth in devices as well as a low double-digit rise in software sales.Combined revenues from EMEA and APAC regions were $206.5 million, highlighting a 9% rise at CER compared with the same period, last year. Growth was particularly strong in the UK, France, Japan, Australia and New Zealand.Adjusted gross margin expanded 11 basis points (bps) year over year to 58.2% in the reported quarter. Selling, general and administrative expenses were up 10.4% year over year to $147.9 million, while there was a 6.8% increase in Research and Development expenses to $36.7 million. This has further led to a 9.7% rise in adjusted operating expenses, amounting to $184.6 million. Accordingly, adjusted operating margin in the quarter contracted 61 bps to 24.9%.Financial UpdateResMed exited the year 2017 with cash and cash equivalents of $821.9 million compared with $731.4 million at the end of 2016.In the entire year, the company generated $414.1 million of cash flow from operations, down from the year-ago figure of $547.9 million, displaying weak underlying earnings and a decline in net working capital balances.Through fiscal 2017, ResMed paid $186.3 million in dividends.Also, during its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings release, ResMed announced an increase in  quarterly dividend by 6% to 35 cents per share.

However, the company still expects to recommence this buy-back program in the second quarter of fiscal 2018.GuidanceWhile ResMed has not provided any definite guidance for fiscal 2018, the company stated that it is well-positioned to achieve its 2020 financial and strategic goals. The company is successfully working on a pipeline of new products and connected care solutions for sleep apnea, COPD, neuromuscular disease and other clinical adjacencies.Our TakeResMed exited fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 on a promising note with both earnings and revenues beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate. On the bright side, the company achieved solid high single-digit global revenue growth this quarter, led by sales of sleep devices, respiratory care devices, mask systems and software solutions. Brightree has acted as a significant contributor to the company’s operating results through 2017.Yet, challenges like competitive bidding and reimbursement issues continue to plague the stock.

However, the year-over-year improvement on the top-line front is on account of strong growth in the international business. Moreover, the quarter marked the third consecutive quarter of more than 20% growth in the international business. Moreover, progress within the U.S. business seems to be encouraging with the continually growing uptake at the iGA platform. Also, the company is set to step into the deformity market with ReLine and MAGEC. The company’s expectation to deliver a higher adjusted operating profit margin of at least 100 bps in 2017 indicates its focus on operational efficiencies and in-house manufacturing facility.

960,ALGN,"CVS Health Corporation’s (CVS  -  Free Report) historic decision to acquire health insurance giant Aetna (AET  -  Free Report) has created quite a buzz in the entire healthcare space. Most economists consider this coming together of two stalwarts — consolidation of CVS Health’s pharmacy benefit management (“PBM”) business with Aetna’s large and unshakable insurance base — as a new dimension added to healthcare landscape. However, critics are of the view that the gains from this combined entity will be short-lived for the healthcare society at large to benefit from.Vision in Favor of the DealPeople supporting this proposed integration between CVS Health and Aetna opine that this merger has fair chances to pass the regulatory hurdles. They see this consolidation as a vertical integration instead of a horizontal one, thus leading to efficiency gain and a formidable cost-cutting strategy of CVS Health’s PBM platform. Notably, a horizontal integration dreads the chances of forming a monopoly powerhouse in the market.An article by Dana Blankenhorn published in InvestorPlace stated that based on this $69 billion deal, insurers will finally achieve the vertical integration they need to control costs. Per the article, the Humana (HUM  -  Free Report) acquisition deal proposed by Aetna was earlier rejected by the Obama administration because of its horizontal acquisition.The economists lapping up the deal are looking much forward to this development as they think this vertical integration might finally put the brakes on America’s soaring health-care costs. Notably, total medical cost has inflated in the 6-7% range over the last four years based on the increasing bills of doctors, hospitals, medical devices and drugs (data published in The Economist article).Blankenhorn in his article stated that to counter this problem, the CVC-Aetna deal will enable insurers to buy pharmacies to fight high drug prices through formularies and the lists of medicines that will be prescribed for various conditions. Using generics in formularies or choosing from branded drugs wherein generics aren’t available is a method to keep drug prices in check.The OppositionThose opposing the buyout comment that despite the two companies trying to strengthen their footprint in health care, both may finally end up paying severely for the merger. Akin to the supporters of the deal, the contrary view underscores the cost-control agenda highlighting that the consolidation will apparently push the United States’ third-largest insurer Aetna’s huge client base into CVS drugstores to get their prescriptions filled through CVS’ drug plans. This move will in turn eliminate the middlemen’s role and other intermediaries in queue, finally resulting in reduction of drug price and overall healthcare cost.However, the critics believe this to be a short-lived scenario and in the longer term, patients could end up incurring more medical expenses. Per a recent Vox report, this is because mergers like this will gradually make it more difficult for the new insurers to enter the market since they won’t be able to negotiate lower drug prices like larger firms. This will in fact diminish competition in the sector leading to inflating prices.To know more in detail, please read: CVS Health's Aetna Buyout to Change Healthcare LandscapeShare Price ComparisonShares of CVS Health have outperformed the broader industry over the past three months.

Within this space, the U.S. market is expected to witness the highest momentum at a CAGR of 4.7%. Thus, in view of the current market potential, we believe that the company’s efforts will help boost the top line.We are also optimistic about the company’s focus on its two-point strategy.

Backus Hospital and The Hospital of Central Connecticut. The company has also completed the acquisition the acquisition of Med Fusion and Clear Point in Texas forming a national precision oncology center of expertise.

Notably, with the FDA approval, Quest Diagnostics will make InSure ONE available to its broad base of physicians, organized provider groups and Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) in the United States. InSure ONE is expected to be commercially available in early 2018. This development is in line with Quest Diagnostics’ consistent efforts to grow in cancer diagnostics.Quest Diagnostics’ relationship with PeaceHealth is well on track. This partnership entails the acquisition of the outreach laboratory as well as a professional laboratory service agreement to manage laboratories at 11 PeaceHealth Medical Centers in Washington State, Oregon and Alaska. This relationship is fully operational and is contributing to Quest Diagnostics’ top line.Per the company, these tuck-in acquisitions fit well within the ambit of M&A guidelines. Quest Diagnostics’ takeover plans are consistent with its goal of contributing 1-2% to revenues annually through accretive acquisitions. Thus, we believe this latest buyout will widen the customer base of this leading diagnostic services information provider.Share Price PerformanceQuest Diagnostics has been gaining investor confidence on consistently positive results.

963,ALGN,"Profitability analysis is generally used to determine the ability of a company for generating ample revenues to meet all its business-related expenses and still manage to offer satisfactory returns to its investors. This analysis helps to determine a profitable company over a loss-making one.The best accounting tool to understand a company’s profitability position is ratio analysis. Generally, there are four key profitability ratios — gross income ratio, operating income ratio, pre-tax profit margin and net income ratio. Here, we have used the most effective and frequently used profitability ratio – net income ratio.Net Income RatioNet income ratio gives us the exact profit level of a company. It reflects the percentage of net income to total sales revenues.

965,ALGN,"Align Technology, Inc. (ALGN  -  Free Report) recently achieved a milestone of five million patients undergoing treatment with its flagship clear aligner system — InvisAlign.Taking into consideration the fast-expanding market for clear aligner therapy, Align Technology has undertaken several strategies to drive the adoption of its core InvisAlign product line. These strategies include product/technology development, extending clinical effectiveness, promoting the InvisAlign brand name and boosting international growth.In terms of product development, in May, the company announced the receipt of two U.S. patents for Align Technology’s SmartTrack aligner material that is exclusively used for InvisAlign aligner treatment. Moreover, in a bid to gain traction in the InvisAlign platform, Align Technology collaborated with Digital Smile Design in March. Post-collaboration, Align Technology’s Invisalign clear aligner treatment can be used by dentists during tooth alignment procedures along with Smile Design protocols.Meanwhile, in order to expand its Invisalign brand offerings, Align Technology introduced a patient-friendly solution — Invisalign Teen with mandibular advancement — for teens in certain markets of Canada, EMEA and APAC in March. In the second quarter of 2017, the company reached a milestone of 1 million teen patients who had adopted the treatment. This is indicative of the growing popularity of Align Technology’s dental products in the international market. Over the long term, we expect G6, G7 and similar innovation to act as major catalysts for Align Technology in new as well as existing markets.Coming to geographic expansion, the company opened its first office in Canada — a major market in terms of opportunity for expansion and growth. Meanwhile, management launched InvisAlign Technology Lite in North America post its introduction in the Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA). The company witnessed strong adoption, particularly among GP dentists.Moreover, Align Technology has been witnessing continued adoption of InvisAlign Technology in core markets in the EMEA and Asia-Pacific (APAC) regions. Interestingly, in the recently reported third quarter, the company achieved another milestone in terms of InvisAlign therapy adoption, where China became the second largest market globally with United States topping the numbers. Align Technology registered almost a threefold year-over-year increase in its asset customer base, with major contributions from China. Also, in a bid to expand in the region, the company opened a InvisAlign Treatment Planning Facility in China in June.We are also upbeat about the company’s expanding foothold internationally through the acquisition of Invisalign distributors in the lucrative EMEA region as well as in Brazil in February.Per a report by Technavio, the global invisible orthodontics market is expected to witness a CAGR of approximately 13% between 2016 and 20120. Given the market potential and Align Technology’s consistent efforts, we believe the company is well positioned to cash in on the bountiful opportunities in the market.Share Price PerformanceOver the past month, Align Technology has been trading above the broader industry. As per the latest share price movement, the company has gained 11.4% compared with the 3.4% gain of the broader industry.Zacks Rank & Other Key PicksAlign Technology currently carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Some other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are PetMed Express, Inc.

966,ALGN,"The latest $1.5-trillion tax reform plan has been a landmark achievement for President Trump. As usual, in its initial stage, the nation gave mixed reactions on the controversial bill. While a few Americans slammed the new plan as a ‘job killer,' others found it to be ‘an excellent opportunity to fix a broken tax code.'While the bill claims to primarily focus on the easing of tax woes for middle-class Americans, the massive cut in corporate taxes tells a different story altogether. In fact, a research report by CNBC reveals that Frank Clemente, executive director of Americans for Tax Fairness, slammed the new tax code as a ""a big giveaway to millionaires and corporations,"" neglecting the ones who are in real need of it.Now, it is to be seen whether the bill is fated to meet an overall failure or it gets to fulfill its promises of ‘inclusive economic growth’.What’s in it for MedTech?“They are cutting taxes on the wealthy and taking health care away from millions,” — Senate Democratic Minority Leader Chuck Schumer.Customer Base to ShrinkWhile the reduction in corporate taxes will encourage the development of expensive cutting-edge MedTech products, the question over its profitability looms large. This is because with a higher number of uninsured and lesser deductions on healthcare costs, the industry is likely to witness a shrinking customer base, indicating a decline in demand for expensive medical procedures and devices.Tax Decision on MedTech Devices ImpendingThe MedTech community has been hopeful since Trump proposed policies that entailed the abolition of the infamous 2.3% medical device sales tax. Such high taxes forced companies to lay off employees, limit research and development activities, and reduce capital investment.Furthermore, AdvaMed, a leading American medical device trade association, had referred to the medical device tax as a ‘significant drag on medical innovation’. Notably, small device companies suffered the most. Amid such worries, a repeal of the tax paradigm is expected to resume an aggressive pace of hiring and investment among the 9,000 America-based medical device manufacturers, instilling investor confidence in the stocks.Per data provided by the medical device trade group (in a Ken Blackwell article published by The Daily Caller), the partial two-year repeal of the MedTech tax had resulted in a roughly 83% rise in research and development (R&D) investments by MedTech players. The comeback of the tax in 2018 will lead to a $15 billion rise in taxes, largely discouraging R&D activities. Undoubtedly, the future of the U.S. MedTech industry depends on the Republicans’ decision on the 2.3% medical device tax.Key PicksPer Trump, the democrats have established a “lousy healthcare” model. However, with a complete medical device tax renovation, it is being widely believed that a new set of streamlined rules will benefit the medical device space.Meanwhile, stocks with strong fundamentals will give you assured returns amid this tax conundrum. We have zeroed in on five stocks that sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and boast strong fundamentals. Notably, all these stocks promise long-term expected earnings growth rate of 10% or more.IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. (IDXX  -  Free Report)Headquartered in Delaware, NJ, IDEXX is a developer, manufacturer and distributer of products and services, primarily for the companion animal veterinary, livestock and poultry, water testing and dairy markets. The company also sells a series of portable electrolytes and blood gas analyzers for the human point-of-care medical diagnostics market.The company continues to demonstrate solid growth globally on strong international expansion. Management’s innovation-based global strategy is leading to CAG Diagnostics growth. Notably, IDEXX expanded its cloud technology portfolio with the addition of rVetLink. Solid organic revenue growth along with a raised guidance for 2017 buoy optimism.The stock has a long-term expected earnings growth rate of 20.4%. IDEXX has a Zacks Rank #2. Over the last year, IDEXX has added 29.6%, higher than the broader industry’s gain of 24.5%.  Luminex Corporation (LMNX  -  Free Report)Luminex develops, manufactures and markets proprietary biological testing technologies with applications throughout the life sciences and diagnostics industry. The company’s open-architecture multiplexing xMAP (Multi-Analyte Profiling) technology is sold worldwide and is used by leading research laboratories as well as major pharmaceutical, diagnostic and biotechnology companies for conducting biological tests.Luminex’s Assay business is likely to be its key growth driver over the long term. The company also witnessed favorable tidings at the regulatory front in the third quarter. In this regard, the recent CE-IVD mark for the ARIES Norovirus Assay, the FDA approval of ARIES C. difficile Assay and the reimbursement approval of VERIGENE assay in Japan are noteworthy. Luminex is on the verge of completing its clinical study for Group A Strep and is close to submitting the same for FDA review.The stock has a long-term expected earnings growth rate of 16.3%.

The company’s flagship product — Signal Extraction (SET) Pulse Oximetry — is used to monitor blood oxygen saturation levels and protect against hypoxemia and hyperoxemia.We believe the company's expanding product portfolio will be a key catalyst. Wider adoption of its non-invasive patient monitoring technology will help the company gain traction. Masimo’s SET pulse oximetry business represents considerable growth opportunities in international markets. Moreover, the FDA 510 (k) approval for the Radius 7 wearable and the O3 regional oximetry device are significant positives.Masimo has a Zacks Rank #2 and promises a long-term expected earnings growth rate of 10.1%. Over the last three months, Masimo has returned 7.6%, higher than the broader industry’s 6.5%.  Align Technology Inc. (ALGN  -  Free Report)Based in California, Align manufactures and markets a system of clear aligner therapy, intra-oral scanners and CAD/CAM (computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing) digital services used in dentistry, orthodontics, and dental records storage.We are encouraged by the company’s solid InvisAlign Technology prospects and growth in North America and internationally, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region. A strong summer season performance drove Invisalign growth in the global teen market. We are also upbeat about the company’s signing of a distribution agreement with Patterson Dental. The company’s receipt of two U.S. patents for SmartTrack InvisAlign Aligner material buoys optimism as well.Align has a Zacks Rank #1, and promises long-term expected earnings growth of 28.9%. Over the last three months, the stock has returned 45.5%, way higher than the broader industry’s 5.2%.  The Cooper Companies Inc. (COO  -  Free Report)Cooper, based in Pleasanton, CA, is a specialty medical device company operating on a global basis. The company is poised to gain from an expanding product portfolio and increasing penetration in International markets.

Notably, the segment banks on the MyDay, Clariti and Biofinity silicone hydrogel lenses platforms. The CooperSurgical segment also delivered strong sales in the quarter. A strong guidance for fiscal 2017 instills our confidence in the stock. Cooper recently completed the acquisition of Procornea.

967,ALGN,"Similar to wise buying decisions, exiting certain underperformers at the right time helps maximize portfolio returns. Selling off losers can be difficult, but if both the share price and estimates are falling, it could be time to get rid of the security before more losses hit your portfolio.One such stock that you may want to consider dropping is Patterson Companies, Inc. (PDCO  -  Free Report),  which has witnessed a significant price decline in the past four weeks, and it has seen negative earnings estimate revisions for the current quarter and the current year. A Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) further confirms weakness in PDCO.A key reason for this move has been the negative trend in earnings estimate revisions. For the full year, we have seen eight estimates moving down in the past 30 days, compared with just no upward revisions. This trend has caused the consensus estimate to trend lower, going from $2.29 a share a month ago to its current level of $2.09.Also, for the current quarter, Patterson Companieshas seen six downward estimate revisions versus one revisions in the opposite direction, dragging the consensus estimate down to 53 cents a share from 59 cents over the past 30 days. The stock also has seen some pretty dismal trading lately, as the share price has dropped 11.2% in the past month.Patterson Companies, Inc. Price and Consensus Patterson Companies, Inc. Price and Consensus | Patterson Companies, Inc. QuoteSo it may not be a good decision to keep this stock in your portfolio anymore, at least if you don’t have a long time horizon to wait.If you are still interested in the  Medical - Dental Supplies industry, you may instead consider a better-ranked stock – Align Technology, Inc.
