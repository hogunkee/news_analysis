7,AMG,"Because of significant market volatility, Affiliated Managers Group Inc.'s (AMG  -  Free Report) revenues remained under pressure over the past few years. Also, its exposure to high debt levels remains a major near-term concern.The company’s price performance does not seem impressive either. Its shares have lost 11.3% so far this year compared with the 4.8% decline for its industry.Moreover, its Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current-year earnings has been revised marginally downward over the last 60 days. This reflects that analysts are pessimistic regarding the company’s earnings growth potential. Thus, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Looking at the fundamentals, while the company’s revenues improved in 2017, the same declined at a four-year (2014-2017) CAGR of 2.8%. Even though its portfolio of investment products provides it a competitive edge when it comes to fulfilling the diverse needs of clients, the current tough operating environment is making it difficult to increase revenues.Moreover, the company uses a high level of debt to finance its operations. Such high levels of debt could limit its flexibility and restrict it from procuring additional finance for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements or other purposes, thereby pushing it into a disadvantageous position.While, the company remains well positioned for growth based on successful partnerships, a diverse product mix and initiatives undertaken to strengthen its retail market operations, the presence of various intangible assets on its balance sheet remains a concern. This is because these intangibles are subject to impairment. Once impaired, the value of these assets may have to be written down, which will adversely affect its financials.Some Investment Management Stocks Worth a LookSome better-ranked investment management firms include AllianceBernstein Holding L.P. (AB  -  Free Report), Waddell & Reed Financial, Inc. (WDR  -  Free Report) and Legg Mason, Inc.

Over the last five years (2013-2017), total AUM witnessed a CAGR of 4.8%.

9,AMG,"Eaton Vance Corp. (EV  -  Free Report) is scheduled to announce first-quarter fiscal 2018 (ended Jan 31) results tomorrow, before the opening bell. Its quarterly revenues and earnings are expected to improve year over year.The company is expected to benefit from increase in revenues supported by its strategic initiatives and a rise in assets under management (AUM). However, higher expenses will likely offset the positives to some extent. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter’s earnings is 71 cents, up 34% year over year.Last quarter, Eaton Vance’s adjusted earnings lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Results were primarily hurt by a rise in expenses.Also, Eaton Vance does not boast an impressive earning surprise history. The company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate only once in the trailing four quarters. Thus, its average earnings surprise was a negative 3.5%.Further, the company’s shares have rallied 14.5% for the three month-ended Jan 31, 2018, outperforming the industry’s growth of 11.8%. Will the stock’s price performance improve post fiscal first-quarter earnings release? Let’s see how things are shaping up. Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model indicates that chances of Eaton Vance beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate is high as it has right combination of two key ingredients — positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Eaton Vance is +2.24%.Zacks Rank: Eaton Vance has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which increases the predictive power of ESP.Factors to Influence Q1 ResultsOn the revenue front, Eaton Vance is likely to gain from the continued improvement in the global equity markets. Also, AUM is projected witness an improvement during the quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for AUM in the to-be-reported quarter is expected to be $443 billion, up 5% sequentially.However, pressure on average effective fee rates is likely to hurt growth in investment advisory and administrative fees. Nonetheless, the top line is likely to witness improvement as outflows from higher fee strategies will likely decrease. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues of $417 million shows 17.9% increase from the prior-year quarter.On the expense front, Eaton Vance’s NextShares initiative is likely to lead to a slight rise in costs during the quarter. Also, the company’s plan to launch new fund products in the United States might result in higher marketing expenses.Further, non-compensation costs are likely to rise due to higher distribution expenses and fund-related costs. Therefore, overall expenses are expected to trend higher in the quarter.Other Stocks That Warrant a LookSome other stocks in the same space worth considering are Ameriprise Financial, Inc.

10,AMG,"T. Rowe Price Group (TROW  -  Free Report) is taking steps to base its European operations in Luxembourg post Brexit, per a Financial Times article.The investment companies are putting their plans into action after the European Commission warned the U.K.-based fund companies that they could be banned from selling products in the European Union (EU) from April 2019.Recently, the company applied to the Luxembourg’s financial regulator to separate its U.K. and Luxembourg operations.The decision to move operations from London to Luxembourg was taken in 2017 and Robert Higginbotham, head of global investment services at T.Rowe Price, expects the new unit to be ready by summer this year.The asset manager already has European operations in Madrid, Milan, Zurich, Frankfurt, Amsterdam, Copenhagen and Stockholm. Higginbotham expects EU offices to be able to report to the Luxembourg entity by the end of 2018.The shifting of operations would not affect jobs in the United Kingdom, while new positions would be available in Luxembourg.Financial Times quoted Higginbotham, “All this is based on what we know about Brexit at the moment — which will probably be about 25 per cent of what we know in a year’s time. We have been working on this for a year and will have to get it complete by the end of the year.”  T.Rowe Price is not the only asset manager that is weighing up its Brexit contingency plans. Per an EY survey that involved about 55 asset and wealth managers, overseeing a combined investment of €25 trillion, half are working on or planning to expand their European operations in an attempt to protect themselves from the impacts of Brexit.T.Rowe Price’s organic growth remains impressive as can be seen from a continuous rise in revenues. Also, its strategic initiatives, including investment in technology and advisory services, bode well for the long term.Shares of T.Rowe Price have gained 55.2% over the past year, outperforming 20.2% rally for the industry it belongs to.The stock carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

11,AMG,"Franklin Resources, Inc. (BEN  -  Free Report) has announced a special cash dividend of $3 per share, to be paid on Apr 12, to shareholders of record as of Mar 29. Along with this, the company has announced a regular quarterly cash dividend of 23 cents per share, which will be paid on the same date.Given that the new Tax Act improved the company’s capital position as well as its financial strength, management feels that a special dividend is the best way to return capital to shareholders.According to 551.7 million of shares outstanding as of Jan 23, 2018, this special dividend represents a total payment of $1.7 billion.In fact, the company’s chairman and CEO, Greg Johnson, said, “This dividend is consistent with our long-term capital management policies and our commitment to our stockholders. We will continue to prudently invest in our business, actively pursue strategic and accretive acquisitions, buyback our stock when it makes economic sense, and distribute the rewards of those investments to our stockholders over time.”Notably, the company also paid a special cash dividend of 50 cents per share in January 2015. Moreover, it has hiked its dividend every year since its inception in 1981, the latest being a 15% increase in December 2017. Further, the company has an efficient share repurchase program in place.Given a solid capital and liquidity position, the company is expected to continue enhancing shareholder value through efficient capital deployment activities.However, question arises, whether it is worth considering Franklin stock for earning this dividend income.Let’s delve deeper into its financial performance and fundamentals to understand the risk and reward.Earnings: Although the company has witnessed nearly 4% decline in its earnings per share (EPS) over the last three-five years, it is expected to deliver a strong earnings performance in the near-term as indicated by its projected EPS growth of nearly 8% and 6.7% for fiscal 2018 and 2019, respectively. Moreover, its long-term (three-five years) projected EPS growth of 9.1% promises reward for shareholders.Valuation: Franklin stock looks overvalued, based on its price-to-earnings (F1) and price-to-sales ratios. The company currently has a P/E (F1) ratio of 11.94 and a P/S ratio of 3.32, which are above the industry averages of 11.76 and 3.09, respectively.Leverage: Franklin has a debt/equity ratio of 0.09, which compares favorably with the industry average of 0.11. This indicates that the company has a lower debt burden, relative to the industry and that it will be financially stable, even in adverse economic conditions.Return on Equity (ROE): The company’s ROE of 13.88% is higher than the industry average of 13.45%. This reflects that it is more efficient in utilizing shareholder funds, compared with its peers.Expenses: Franklin has been successful in reducing costs for the last few years. Expenses have declined nearly 7%, 14% and 3% in fiscals 2015, 2016 and 2017, respectively. Thus, lower expenses are expected to aid bottom-line growth in the quarters ahead.Share Price Movement: The company’s price performance does not look impressive. Its shares have lost 5.8% in the past year, as against 19.9% growth for the industry it belongs to.Our TakeWhile a stretched valuation and poor price performance make us a little apprehensive about the stock, we believe that it is a wise idea to add the stock to your portfolio now, given its declining expenses, a lower debt burden, superior ROE and good earnings growth prospects.Moreover, its Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current fiscal-year earnings has been revised nearly 3.5% upward over the last 30 days, indicating analysts’ optimism regarding its earnings growth potential. Thus, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Other Stocks to ConsiderA few other stocks in the same space worth considering are Waddell & Reed Financial, Inc.

23,AMG,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Affiliated Managers Group, Inc. (AMG  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Affiliated Managers has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 15.02, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 21.47. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, Affiliated Managers’ current PE level puts it below its midpoint of 16.98 over the past five years. Moreover, the current level stands well below the highs for the stock, suggesting that it could be a great entry point.Further, the stock’s PE compares favorably with the Zacks Finance sector’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 16.91. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers. We should also point out that Affiliated Managers has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 14.15, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for Affiliated Managers stock in the near term too.PEG RatioWhile earnings are certainly important, it is essential to know how much you are paying for the growth of earnings as well. One can easily do that with the PEG ratio (ratio of the P/E to the expected future earnings growth rate). The PEG ratio gives a more complete picture of the valuation of a stock than the P/E ratio.Affiliated Managers’ PEG ratio stands at just 0.85, compared with the Zacks Finance – Investment Management industry average of 1.26. This suggests a decent undervalued trading relative to its earnings growth potential right now.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Affiliated Managers currently has a Value Score of B, putting it into the top 40% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes Affiliated Managers a solid choice for value investors.What About the Stock Overall?Though Affiliated Managers might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of C and a Momentum Score of B. This gives AMG a Zacks VGM score — or its overarching fundamental grade — of B. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been somewhat encouraging. The current quarter has and full year estimates have seen one upward revision each, over the past 30 days compared to no downward revisions.This has had a slightly positive impact on the consensus estimate, as the current quarter consensus estimate has climbed 0.5% in the past month, while the full year estimate has inched higher by 0.2%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Affiliated Managers Group, Inc. Price and Consensus  Affiliated Managers Group, Inc. Price and Consensus | Affiliated Managers Group, Inc. QuoteHowever, this somewhat bullish trend has likely not yet been reflected in the stock, as we have just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which indicates expectations of in-line performance in the near term.Bottom LineAffiliated Managers is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Despite having a Zacks Rank #3, the stock possesses an impressive Zacks Industry Rank (among top 39% of more than 250 industries) which hints at favorable broader factors. In fact, over the past two years, the industry has clearly outperformed the broader market, as you can see below:So, it might pay for value investors to delve deeper into the company’s prospects, as fundamentals indicate that this stock could be a compelling pick.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!

26,AMG,"A gradually stabilizing economy and interest rate hikes are expected to aid the performance of investment managers in the recently concluded quarter.The investment management industry, which comprises asset managers and brokerage firms, typically benefits from a rising rate environment. As interest rates rise, brokerage firms engage in more investment activities. Moreover, as they earn interest income on un-invested cash in customer accounts, higher rates allow them to make more interest income.Also, most investment managers have waived off the majority of their fees with the rates rising since last year. This decline in fee waivers is expected to aid the company’s top-line growth in their upcoming results.Further, the performance of investment brokers is generally measured through monthly average client trades per day that represent the number of trades from which they can expect commission or fees. Per the monthly metrics released by most brokerage firms, the average revenue trades for July and August have witnessed improvement on a year-over-year basis. This should get reflected in their results for the to-be-reported quarter.Despite inflation-related issues and increasing chances of political uncertainty, most of the asset managers have seen an improvement in their assets under management (AUM) for July and August. Moreover, with expectations of modest volatility, the performance of asset managers is expected to be decent for the to-be-reported quarter.Hence, it’s a wise idea to bet on a few investment management stocks that are expected to report sequential earnings growth.Choosing the Right StocksWith the help of the Zacks Stock Screener, we have shortlisted four investment management stocks whose earnings per share (EPS) for the prior quarter witnessed growth of more than 1% sequentially.

The deal, which is expected to be completed by the second quarter upon receiving necessary third-party approvals, will be funded using cash and debt.Earlier in August, there were reports of Invesco buying the entire retail business of Guggenheim Partners.

It will add to its already-expanding portfolio, which offers ETFs under the PowerShares label. Once the deal is complete, Invesco's ETF AUM is expected to be worth more than $196 billion globally, as of Aug 31, 2017.The deal should lead to further improvement in the company’s top line, which has been growing since the last few years, owing to continued improvement in its AUM balance. Moreover, Invesco believes that the transaction will help in expanding, strengthening and broadening its investment capabilities in the growing ETF market globally.Moreover, the acquisition is likely to enhance Invesco’s ability to provide solutions to its institutional and retail clients, both in the United States as well as globally so that they can better achieve their investment objectives.Invesco’s President and CEO, Martin L. Flanagan, said, “We've built and managed Invesco over many years with a single focus:  to help clients achieve their investment objectives.

29,AMG,"Ameriprise Financial, Inc.’s (AMP  -  Free Report) Long-Term Issuer Credit Rating has been affirmed at “a-” by A.M. Best. The company’s Long-Term Issue Credit Ratings have also been affirmed. The ratings outlook remains stable.Additionally, A.M. Best has affirmed RiverSource Life Insurance Company and its subsidiary’s Long-Term Issuer Credit Rating of “aa-” and its Financial Strength Rating of A+.Also, the Financial Strength Rating and Long-TermIssuer Credit Rating of IDS Property Casualty Insurance Company and its subsidiary have been affirmed at “A” and “a+”, respectively.RiverSource Life Insurance Company is based in Minneapolis and is the key life/health insurance subsidiary of Ameriprise, while IDS Property Casualty Insurance Company is the property/casualty insurance subsidiary of Ameriprise.Ameriprise remains well positioned for growth, given its discipline in financial planning and strengths in product development. The company has an effective and well-developed enterprise risk management program in place, which helps in hedging risks. Additionally, Ameriprise offers various variable annuity as well as fixed annuity products to retail clients through its Annuities segment. These variable annuity products offer relatively modest guarantees, which help in reducing variable annuity guarantee risks for the company. Notably, Ameriprise is on track to effectively cover its interest payments and maintains moderate financial leverage.However, Ameriprise’s operations are highly correlated with the performance of the equity markets and client activities. Over the last few quarters, equity markets have remained volatile. Also, client activity is low. Thus, A.M. Best believes that if interest rates remain low for annuity and long-term care insurance businesses, Ameriprise’s operating margins will be hurt.Also, the Asset Management segment remains one of the major sources of Ameriprise’s revenues. The segment has been witnessing outflows over the past few years. In fact, due to uncertainty in financial markets and stiff competition, outflows are expected to continue in the coming quarters, thus affecting the segment’s performance.Nevertheless, it is on account of the various positives of the company that its ratings have been affirmed at the current level.The ratings affirmation of RiverSource Life Insurance Company reflect its solid risk-adjusted capital position, effective hedging programs, favorable operating results and strong market position.On the other hand, IDS Property Casualty Insurance Company, along with its subsidiary, provides diversification benefits to Ameriprise. It helps in diversifying risks and earnings, offers products to affinity partners and its municipal bond portfolio provides tax benefits.Ameriprise’s shares have gained 47.2% in a year’s time, outperforming the 27.1% growth for the industry it belongs to.Currently, the stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks from the same space are Och-Ziff Capital Management Group LLC (OZM  -  Free Report), Affiliated Managers Group, Inc.

33,AMG,"The performance of investment managers (which are part of the broader Zacks Finance sector) has been decent over the last several quarters. Results are not expected to be unusual this time too, as the markets and currencies remained favorable. Also, the industry witnessed better-than-expected flows this time around.Although the U.S. markets supported equity assets with marginal returns amid mixed economic data, both the non-U.S. developed and emerging markets aided a decent growth of equity assets with better performances. Hence, asset managers with global presence are expected to register a rise in equity asset under management (AUM). Moreover, a weak U.S. dollar drove the global diversified AUM mix.Also, fee waivers are expected to decline in the quarter due to rising interest rates. However, higher marketing and investment costs are anticipated to hurt bottom-line growth.Per our latest Earnings Outlook, overall earnings for Investment managers in second-quarter 2017 are likely to be up 7.7%.Our quantitative model offers some insights into stocks that are about to report earnings. Per the model, in order to be confident of an earnings beat, a stock needs to have the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Let’s take a look at the three investment managers that are scheduled to release second-quarter results on Jul 31.Artisan Partners Asset Management Inc.

34,AMG,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Affiliated Managers Group, Inc. (AMG  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Affiliated Managers has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 13.52, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 20.52. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, Affiliated Managers’s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks classified Financial - Investment Management industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 17.17. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that Affiliated Managers has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 12.18, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for Affiliated Managers stock in the near term too.P/CF RatioAn often overlooked ratio that can still be a great indicator of value is the price/cash flow metric. This ratio doesn’t take amortization and depreciation into account, so can give a more accurate picture of the financial health in a business.This is a preferred metric to some valuation investors because cash flows are (a) generally less prone to manipulation by the company’s management and (b) are less affected by variation in accounting policies between different companies.The ratio is generally applied to find out whether a company’s stock is overpriced or underpriced with reference to its cash flows generation potential compared with its competitors.

35,AMG,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Affiliated Managers Inc. (AMG  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Affiliated Managers has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 13.52, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 20.52. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, Affiliated Managers’s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years, with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks classified Investment Mnagement industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 17.17. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers. We should also point out that Affiliated Managers has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 12.18, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for Affiliated Managers stock in the near term too.P/CF RatioAn often overlooked ratio that can still be a great indicator of value is the price/cash flow metric. This ratio doesn’t take amortization and depreciation into account, so can give a more accurate picture of the financial health in a business.This is a preferred metric to some valuation investors because cash flows are (a) generally less prone to manipulation by the company’s management and (b) are less affected by variation in accounting policies between different companies.The ratio is generally applied to find out whether a company’s stock is overpriced or underpriced with reference to its cash flows generation potential compared with its competitors. However, it is not commonly used for cross-industry comparison, as the average price to cash flow ratio varies from industry to industry.In this case, Affiliated Managers’s P/CF ratio of 16.87 is lower than the Zacks classified Investment Mnagementindustry average of 20.64, which indicates that the stock is somewhat undervalued in this respect.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Affiliated Managers currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of ‘B’, putting it into the top 40% of all stocks we cover from this look.
