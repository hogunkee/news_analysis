10,AFL,"Andrew Cilek might be — this is just a hunch — unaware that 2018 is Brooks Brothers' bicentennial. Judging by what he wore when he went out to vote in Minneapolis on Nov. 2, 2010, his preferences in shirts run less to button-down Oxford cloth than to chatty T-shirts. The question the U.S. Supreme Court will consider on Wednesday is whether Cilek's expressive shirt impermissibly interfered with Minnesota's interest in maintaining ""peace, order and decorum"" at polling places.XMinnesota forbids voters from wearing in a polling place political badges, buttons or other insignia designed to ""influence and impact"" voting, or ""promoting a group with recognizable political views,"" even if the things worn do not refer to any candidate or issue on that day's ballot. Nine other states have similar laws, and all 50 states have ""speech-free zones"" around polling places. Cilek's T-shirt featured the Gadsden Flag (""Don't Tread on Me"") and a small tea party logo. He also sported a button, from a group worried about voter fraud, that read ""Please I.D. Me."" He was temporarily prevented from voting, so, being a real — that is, litigious — American he went to court.The Supreme Court has found no constitutional infirmity in campaign-free zones, but Minnesota's law as Cilek experienced it seems to mandate a First Amendment-free zone, which he says is unconstitutionally overbroad. Minnesota has admitted that its law also would forbid apparel bearing the logos of, for example, the Chamber of Commerce and the AFL-CIO, which do indeed have ""recognizable political views."" These might (to use the language of campus speech police) ""trigger"" in people who see them ... what? Political thoughts perhaps tangentially related to candidates or propositions on the ballot?A lower court upheld the law used against Cilek's T-shirt as furthering Minnesota's legitimate interest in polling-place ""peace, order and decorum"" and ""the integrity of its election process"" and — the nanny state never sleeps — to protect voters ""from confusion and undue influence."" What is more offensive, the paternalistic condescension of the government assuming that ""confusion"" will somehow discombobulate voters who glimpse, say, an ""American Legion"" or ""NAACP"" sweatshirt, or the government's hubris as censor of influence that is ""undue""?It is one thing to ban, as the court has allowed, active ""solicitation of votes"" in or close to a polling place. It is, however, a bit much for Minnesota to forbid passive expression of political — very broadly defined — allegiances not associated with any person or issue being voted on. What about a shirt emblazoned with the words ""America is the land of opportunity""? Those words, which a guide for University of California employees says can constitute a ""microaggression,"" could trigger fainting spells among voters at polling places sniffing for the reek of unchecked white privilege.Track Top Stocks And Market Trends With Free IBD NewslettersAnd what about a T-shirt with a pristinely unpolitical message (e.g., ""I despise cocker spaniels"") that might disturb some sensitive souls in a polling place? The Supreme Court can try to enunciate what is unimaginable — clear standards concerning every conceivable language use in a hypersensitive America. Or the court can give its squint of strict scrutiny to all such polling-place laws, many of which will not pass muster. Otherwise, polling-place officials will have broad discretion to lay down the law, if it can be dignified as law, on an ad hoc basis concerning what is and is not a ""recognizable"" political view or ""undue"" influence.The First Amendment was ratified in 1791. One hundred and twenty-eight years passed before the court confronted a case — three cases, actually — squarely concerning freedom of speech. Dealing disgracefully with residues of Woodrow Wilson's wartime semi-totalitarianism, the court held: During wartime, the government can restrict speech that could ""create a clear and present danger"" of evils that Congress has the power to prevent. And the guarantee of free speech does not protect printing leaflets urging disruption of the war effort. And Wilson's administration did not violate the amendment when it imprisoned Eugene Victor Debs — he had received 6% of presidential vote as the Socialist Party's candidate in 1912 — because he made an anti-war speech.Nowadays, the court frequently adjudicates speech controversies because governments eagerly embrace sinister rationalizations for ""balancing"" free speech against competing values, to the detriment of free speech. Hence the court should affirm Cilek's admirably prickly resistance to Minnesota's officiousness. Today more than ever, with freedom of expression increasingly threatened, an American's default position regarding restrictions should be: Don't tread on me.You might also like ...Janus v.

12,AFL,"Tax Reform: Not long ago, Democrats expected that the GOP tax cuts would be a political disaster for Republicans, just like ObamaCare was for Democrats in 2010. How's that prediction working out?X Writing in the Atlantic in December, longtime political reporter Ron Brownstein argued that ""President Trump and congressional Republicans have just taken the same leap of faith that Democrats did when they passed the Affordable Care Act.""He went on to note that after Democrats passed ObamaCare in early 2010 — despite strong public opposition — the backlash from voters ""helped propel Republicans to the biggest midterm gain in the House for either party since 1938 and gave them a majority in the chamber they still haven't relinquished.""The left-wing news site Huffington Post echoed that sentiment — with a story headlined ""ObamaCare Plagued Democrats In 2010. The GOP Just Voted For A Bill Even Less Popular"" — predicting that the GOP would end up ""hoping that when voters head to the ballot box next year, the tax bill isn't at the top of many minds.""It's true that ObamaCare contributed to the huge GOP gains in 2010. But the idea that the allegedly unpopular tax plan would likewise propel Democrats to victory this November was a fantasy.It turns out that — unlike ObamaCare — the more people know about the GOP tax cuts, the more they like them.Track Top Stocks And Market Trends With Free IBD NewslettersIn fact, the latest poll from The New York Times finds 51% supporting it. That's up from 37% in December and 46% in January. Other polls, including the IBD/TIPP poll,  have found similar shifts.The growing support was the result of a raft of companies giving bonuses, raises, better benefits to millions of workers, along with new job-creating investments in plant and equipment, as a direct result of the tax cuts.The New York Times poll came out just as workers were starting to get bigger paychecks, thanks to the lower federal tax withholding, also due to the tax bill. So public support is likely to climb even further.ObamaCare, in contrast, was unpopular when it was passed, and was increasingly unpopular in the first two months when it took effect. (See nearby chart.)The popularity of the tax cuts might have been a surprise to those in the liberal Washington bubble, but wasn't a surprise to us.We noted in December — around the same time Brownstein, Huffington Post and others were predicting an ObamaCare-scale disaster for the GOP — that the tax bill was far more popular than the mainstream media let on.Unlike most other polls — which simply asked people to give a thumbs up or down on the ""Republican tax cuts"" — the IBD/TIPP poll asked about specifics in the bill.""When people are asked about key provisions in the tax bill, support rises across the board,"" we noted.""The pundit class will continue to yammer about the political risks of this bill to Republicans, but it's Democrats who face the bigger challenge,"" we continued. ""Once the public realizes the benefits of the tax plan, how do they explain that not one Democrat voted for it?""And wouldn't you know, that's just what happened.In fact, it's Republicans who are planning to run on the tax cuts in November, and Democrats who are fumbling about wondering what to do.Priorities USA, a top Democratic super PAC, warned Democrats in a memo recently that the GOP tax bill was gaining in popularity, and then advised Democrats to ""counter the narrative being pushed by the White House.""But how?Democrats tried to dismiss the tax cuts, bonuses and raises workers were getting ""crumbs,"" which made them look arrogant, rich and out of touch.Pelosi's latest gambit is to call the tax cuts ""unpatriotic.""Yeah, that will go over well with working families now benefiting from the extra take-home pay.Julie Greene, who is heading up midterm campaign efforts for the AFL-CIO, was recently quoted as saying ""if we spend all of our cycle running against the tax bill, it's probably going to be a mistake.""That's true, but what other choice do Democrats have?You might also like ...That Democrat 'Blue Wave' Is Starting To Look More Like A RippleRevenues Climbed $18 Billion In First Month Of GOP Tax CutsJust Say No To A Gas-Tax Hike

21,AFL,"As you watch your children board the school bus for the first day back to classes, consider this: If you don't live in one of the 28 states with a Right to Work law, chances are that school bus driver is forced to pay fees to a union as a condition of driving that bus. The teachers at the school the bus is heading toward likely face the same choice: Pay money to the union or be fired.Why? Because there are still 22 forced-unionism states in America, where a union official can legally have a worker fired for not paying union dues or fees.You are not alone if this coercive power offends you. Polls consistently show that 80% of Americans agree with the Right to Work principle: No worker should be forced to pay union fees as a condition of employment.Under Right to Work laws, enacted in the other 28 states, employees are still free to join a union if they choose and support that union with dues. The difference is the choice belongs to each worker individually, so they can decide if payment of union dues is a good use of their hard-earned money or if the money is better spent elsewhere.While today union officials oppose Right to Work protections for workers, one of their most important predecessors, Samuel Gompers — founder of the American Federation of Labor (AFL) in 1886 — was a strong opponent of compulsory unionism. Gompers, who served as the longest-tenured president of the group that would later become the AFL-CIO wrote that: ""The workers of America adhere to voluntary institutions in preference to compulsory systems which are held to be not only impractical but a menace to their rights, welfare, and their liberty.""Instead of heeding Gompers' advice, today Big Labor is doing everything in its power to deny workers the choice provided by Right to Work. Union lawyers are currently attempting to overturn Right to Work laws in Idaho, Kentucky, West Virginia and Wisconsin with legal challenges. In Missouri, union officials have already begun pouring millions of dollars — much of it seized from workers who would be fired for refusing to pay — into an effort to overturn that state's recently-enacted Right to Work law through a ballot measure.Big Labor's desperation on the issue is a response to the recent spread of workplace freedom. In the past five years, six states have passed Right to Work laws, with Kentucky and Missouri joining the ranks earlier this year.Additionally, a case brought by National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation staff attorneys, challenging forced union dues as a violation of government employees' First Amendment rights, is pending before the U.S. Supreme Court. A ruling freeing millions of teachers, police officers, firefighters and other government employees from mandatory union fees could come in the first half of 2018.The case for Right to Work has always centered on the freedom it provides workers, but there is also overwhelming evidence that freeing workers from forced dues gives Right to Work states an economic leg up.From 2005-2015, private-sector job growth was 15.4% in Right to Work states compared to just 10.4% in forced-unionism states, according to government statistics compiled by the National Institute for Labor Relations Research. The same research shows that once you adjust for the cost of living, workers in Right to Work states had on average $2,500 more to spend in disposable personal income than their forced-unionism counterparts.Given the facts, it is no surprise that a growing number of states are eager to cast off Big Labor's chokehold, free their workforce, and realize the economic opportunity that a Right to Work law would bring.Ultimately, though, because forced-dues powers are granted to union officials by federal law, the best solution for ending compulsory union dues is a National Right to Work Act. This one-page bill already introduced in Congress simply eliminates from federal law the authorizations for forced union dues, leaving workers covered by federal labor laws free to choose for themselves whether or not to join and pay dues to a labor organization.So as you enjoy Labor Day weekend, remember that when it concludes millions of Americans will return to work where they face a choice: Pay a portion of their paychecks to a union they may not support or lose their jobs.Honoring America's hardworking men and women must mean respecting workers to make their own choice about whether or not to send their money to a labor union, so let's work to make this the final Labor Day during which Americans labor under compulsory unionism.

24,AFL,"Regulations: In the realm of useless regulations, few come close to the impending requirement that public companies post CEO-to-worker pay ratios. Yet getting rid of this rule won't be so easy.Added at the last minute to the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform bill, the provision will force 3,800-odd publicly traded companies to calculate the ratio between their CEOs' total compensation and that of their median workers, and report the gap starting next year.Sounds easy, right? Except that reality is far more complicated than Washington lawmakers imagined, given the complexities of modern workforces — what with contract employees, part-timers, foreign workers, etc. Initial compliance costs were pegged at $1.3 billionAnd for what? The rule itself was nothing more than a politically motivated sop to labor unions, which have for years been publishing reports claiming that the average CEO makes more than 300 times as much as the average worker.But this claim has been thoroughly debunked by economist Mark Perry, who found that the AFL-CIO was comparing total compensation of the top 2% of CEOs in the country to the average annual cash wage — not including benefits — of all full- and part-time workers. It's a textbook case of an apples-to-oranges comparison.Even if the gap were as large as unions claim, the resulting Securities and Exchange Commission disclosure rule is worse than useless.For one thing, CEO compensation already gets reported every year, for all to see, making it easy to compare executive pay rates among and between industries.The pay gap, however, will be completely useless as a comparative measure because of the number of variables that can affect worker wages. Firms operating largely in low-cost parts of the country, for example, could come off looking worse, while those that outsource most of their production to Chinese slave-labor camps would look better.The SEC admitted as much, saying ""there are significant limitations to using the pay ratio information for comparative purposes in light of the various factors that could affect employee compensation.""SEC commissioner Michael S. Piwowar, goes further, pointing out in his dissent to the rule that an investment advisor using this pay-gap information to provide investment advice ""could find itself in breach of its fiduciary duty.""And while the rule was clearly meant to shame companies into paying CEOs less, it could easily backfire. Piwowar, who is now acting chair of the SEC, points to studies showing that ""pay ratio disclosure could exacerbate any upward bias in executive pay by providing another benchmark that could be used in certain situations to increase CEO compensation (i.e., for a CEO whose company's pay ratio is lower than its peers' pay ratios).""Despite its glaring flaws, however, this rule might still go into effect. While the House-approved Dodd-Frank repeal bill would chuck the rule, there's no telling when or if the Senate will get to follow suit.And, as the Washington Post explains: As it stands now, the lone Democrat on the SEC can prevent the commission from delaying the rule simply by not showing up for a vote, thereby denying it a quorum.A costly federal rule that does no one any good and can't be gotten rid of? Welcome to the swamp.RELATED:Do CEOs Make 300 Times What Workers Get?

"
25,AFL,"Income Inequality: Every year the AFL-CIO puts out a grossly misleading but widely covered report on ""excessive"" CEO pay. But what about top union bosses? Turns out their salaries are actually bigger than that of the average CEO.The latest report from the AFL-CIO claims that the CEO-to-worker pay ratio in 2016 was 347 to 1. In other words, for every dollar the average worker makes, the top CEOs in the country make $347. That's up from 123 to 1 in the mid-1990s, and 20 to 1 in the 1960s.That's the story anyway. And every year, the statistic gets extensively reported as an indicator of increasing income inequality in the U.S., and is used to push for limits on CEO pay or tax hikes on the rich.But as University of Michigan economist and American Enterprise Institute scholar Mark Perry explains, this pay gap is wildly exaggerated because the AFL-CIO is comparing an inflated CEO compensation number to a lowball estimate of worker pay.For CEOs, Perry notes, the AFL-CIO uses the average total compensation for just 400 of the S&P 500 chief executives, which works out to $13.1 million each.For the worker pay, however, it uses data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics on the average hourly cash wages earned by nonsupervisory workers. For 2016, that was $21.56 an hour. The AFL-CIO multiplies this hourly wage by 52 weeks to come up with an average annual wage of $37,600.But the BLS data is for an average workweek of just 33.6 hours. And, this number doesn't include the value of health and other benefits provided by employers.So, the AFL-CIO is comparing the full compensation packages for a thin slice of the highest paid CEOs in the country — who put in 40, 50, 60 or more hours a week — to just the cash wages of a mix of full- and part-time workers.No wonder the gap is so big.Perry notes that if you include only those working 40-hours a week, and include their fringe benefits, the CEO-to-worker pay ratio is cut almost in half — down to 198 to 1.Even that's a gross exaggeration, since the AFL-CIO report only includes at a tiny sample of CEOs.Bureau of Labor Statistics data show that there are 223,260 chief executives in the country, most of whom work for small and midsize firms. And the average wage for all CEOs in 2016 was … $194,350.If you use that figure, the CEO-to-worker pay ratio drops all the way down to 5 to 1, which hardly seems shocking at all.Here's what is shocking: Labor union presidents made an average of $252,370 last year, plus another $31,000 in benefits, according to an analysis by the Center for Union Facts. The analysis looked at federal labor filings for 192 national, state and local unions.That means union bosses make $60,000 more in wages than the average private-sector CEO. And they make 7 times as much as the average worker.The highest-paid union president, Airline Pilots Association President Timothy Canoll, pulled down a base salary of $526,292, plus another $250,000 in benefits.Rather than complain about how much private-sector CEOs make, union workers might want to demand that Big Labor bosses justify their own outsized pay first.RELATED:Democrats Side With Union Bosses Over Veterans In VA Accountability FightCan Trump Win His Battle With The Unionized, Bureaucratic 'Deep State'?2017: A Year Of State Labor Reforms

28,AFL,"President Trump will reportedly sign an executive order as early as today to pave the way for a renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement to begin almost immediately. One of his chief demands could be a major increase in Mexico's minimum wage.Commerce Secretary nominee Wilbur Ross telegraphed the move in last week's confirmation hearing: ""The minimum wage in Mexico has rarely changed in pesos for quite a few years, and the peso has depreciated quite a lot against the dollar, so on a purchasing-power basis, the average Mexican worker is far worse off than he or she was five or 10 years ago.""""That was not the original intent of Nafta,"" Ross said, indicating that would be ""a very serious topic for consideration"" in renegotiating the trade pact.Yet it's hard to imagine that an increase in the minimum wage could be big enough to make much of an impact. Including benefits, compensation paid by Ford (F), General Motors (GM) and other automakers in Mexico has averaged about $8 an hour compared to $46 an hour in the U.S. in recent years, according to the Center for Automotive Research. Meanwhile, Mexico's minimum daily wage, which just got a 10% hike for 2017, amounts to just $3.75 per day, or less than 7% of a full day's pay at the $7.25 federal minimum hourly wage in the U.S.In reality, there's little connection between minimum wages and manufacturing wages, which are determined by productivity and market forces. A Bank of America Merrill Lynch analysis last year noted that hourly wages in Mexico went from 183% higher than wages in China in 2003, in dollar terms, to 40% lower than hourly pay in China at the end of 2015. That shift didn't stem from minimum-wage hikes in China but labor-market forces, notably the greater demand for workers as aging demographics in China have worked against supply.Higher pay and a tighter labor supply in China help explain why Foxconn, the contract manufacturing giant that produces the Apple (AAPL) iPhone, said last year that it was in the process of replacing 60,000 workers with robots. That, and the cost of transporting increasingly large screens, also are behind the news that Foxconn is considering building a $7 billion digital display factory in the U.S. with Apple.Nafta rules wouldn't permit a big border tax on companies that set up production in Mexico for U.S.-bound goods, so renegotiation offers a possible way of avoiding Trump's threatened tariffs. Yet prospects for such a deal are unclear.IBD'S TAKE: Trump's threat of a big border tariff is the stick, while the carrot is his plan to slash the corporate tax rate to make the U.S. a more attractive place to manufacture and grow. The big question investors are waiting to find out is how Trump will pay for it and whether it will be with a border-adjusted tax that hits retail.Ross also highlighted Nafta's country-of-origin rules as a chief target for reform. Nafta ended tariffs for goods ""made in North America,"" but that designation only requires 62.5% of a product's content to be produced in Mexico, Canada or the U.S. ""It still allows for nearly 40% of a car to be made in China,"" the AFL-CIO said in laying out its own blueprint for renegotiating the trade pact.Nafta also requires the U.S. government to treat Canadian and Mexican goods and services as American for many procurement decisions. The AFL-CIO wants that chapter of Nafta thrown out, which seems consistent with Trump's inauguration speech vow: ""We will follow two simple rules: Buy American and hire American.""A renegotiation also could add e-commerce provisions and strengthened labor rights, says Welles Orr, trade specialist at Miller & Chevalier and assistant U.S. trade representative in the George H.W. Bush administration. But he doesn't see new minimum wage mandates as a realistic way to shift the incentive for producing in Mexico vs. the U.S.While Orr sees potential for a renegotiation outcome that Trump can use to declare victory, any deal is likely to fall far short of his campaign rhetoric. That's because there's a limit to what Mexico and Canada will agree to, and the cost of scrapping the agreement — ""utter economic chaos"" for the auto industry — makes it unlikely that Trump would try to scrap it.On Monday, Trump officially pulled out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade pact — which was agreed to by the Obama administration but never came to a vote in Congress — formalizing Trump's abandonment of the policy, as expected.RELATED:Foxconn Mulls $7 Billion U.S. Factory With AppleTrump Trade: What He Can Do Legally On Nafta, China, Mexico, Taxes Apple, GM, Boeing Are China's Top Hostages In A Trump Trade War

30,AFL,"In a video posted to his political campaign's YouTube account on Nov. 21, President-elect Donald Trump vowed to withdraw the U.S. from the ongoing negotiations related to the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), a 12-nation trade agreement designed to reduce government barriers and tariffs restricting exchanges between consumers and producers in Asian countries.By restricting trade and making it harder for goods to flow in and out of the country, Trump, who campaigned on promises to make government work for the working man, would actually be making government work for special-interest groups, such as industry lobbyists.Milton Friedman, an economist allegedly revered by many lawmakers who are now backing Trump's trade tirades, warned us about how voluntary exchange across national borders is a canary for looming political problems.In his book ""Capitalism and Freedom,"" Friedman wrote that nationalist attacks against free trade are often the first step toward an assault on freedom.""Interferences with international trade appear innocuous; they can get the support of people who are otherwise apprehensive of interference by government into economic affairs; many a businessman even regards them as part of the 'American Way of Life'; yet there are few interferences which are capable of spreading so far and ultimately being so destructive of free enterprise,"" Friedman wrote. ""There is much experience to suggest that the most effective way to convert a market economy into an authoritarian economic society is to start by imposing direct controls on foreign exchange. This one step leads inevitably to the rationing of imports, to control over domestic production that uses imported products or that produces substitutes for imports, and so on in a never-ending spiral.""Lowering foreign governments' barriers against American-grown agricultural goods and expanding the scope of markets into which American goods could be more fairly traded and sold would have benefited people in rural areas, Trump's geographic power base in the Nov. 8 election.According to estimates from the American Farm Bureau Federation, TPP would have increased annual U.S. net farm income by about $4.4 billion and created over 40,000 farming jobs.Free-trade opponents, now ascendant, have claimed TPP was a scheme designed by big businesses to benefit big businesses. Ironically, the Center for Responsive Politics' examination of over 400 reports filed with the U.S. Secretary of the Senate's Office of Public Records shows much TPP-related lobbying did not come from potential beneficiaries, but from well-funded opponents seeking special government protections from competition, such as the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO) and the United Automobile Workers (UAW).AFL-CIO and UAW are only able to exist by siphoning their lifeblood from the body of productive voluntary exchange in the same way a parasite might. By seeking to insert Washington, D.C., into the process of consumers trading dollars for goods and producers trading goods for dollars, by erecting trade barriers, lawmakers are handing AFL-CIO and UAW even more opportunities for graft.The effects of Trump's anti-trade rhetoric aren't limited to keeping U.S. goods off the shelves in Japan or Malaysia, though. In September 2016, Trump promised to add a 35% tax on automobiles manufactured in Mexico, a country often scapegoated by ""economic nationalists.""""When that (Ford) car comes back across the border into our country that now comes in free, we're going to charge them a 35% tariff,"" Trump told morning talk-show hosts in September.This economic nationalism, implemented in the form of a wall against shipping goods purchased by American consumers, would add about $2.8 billion to the Ford company's cost of business, causing automobile retail prices to shoot up in response to the federal government's added regulatory costs.As Friedman also famously observed, ""One of the great mistakes is to judge policies and programs by their intentions rather than their results."" After running a campaign predicated on helping the little guy get ahead, such policies would have the opposite effect.Trump's economic populism may be intended to benefit the working man and not the connected insider, but restricting free trade and giving Washington a larger role in people's economic decisions will only benefit government and those who depend on government for their paychecks. RELATED:Dems Embrace Organized Labor, And Labor Embraces Them Right BackIs 'Transparency' In Trade Talks Just A Smoke Screen?Is Free Trade Dead?

31,AFL,"On Tuesday, labor unions will hold a ""national day of disruption,"" planning protests at 20 airports and fast-food restaurants in 340 U.S. cities. The union-backed Fight for $15 — the chief organizer of the protests — hopes to convey Big Labor's ""unrelenting opposition"" to President-elect Trump's ""extremist agenda to move the country to the right.""It's another not-so-subtle reminder of Big Labor's outsized influence in the political system. In recent months, labor leaders have pulled out all the stops to make their presence known — from strikes and disruptive demonstrations to an unprecedented increase in political cash.In 2016, labor unions made more than $142 million in campaign contributions — almost 90% of it to Democrats. (The 2004 and 2008 elections saw less than $140 million combined.)According to the Center for Responsive Politics, the National Education Association — America's largest teachers union — led the way with nearly $20 million to date. Richard Trumka's AFL-CIO wasn't far behind at roughly $11.5 million, while the Service Employees International Union — the primary supporter of the Fight for $15 — pledged $3 million of its own.Union organizers were especially active in battleground states, which they flooded with pro-Democrat digital advertising, direct-mail pieces, and door-knocking campaigns. The AFL-CIO carried out a six-figure ad buy and distributed 500,000 fliers in the key swing states. In Ohio, For Our Future — a $60 million super-PAC backed by the AFL-CIO and other unions — knocked on well over a million doors in support of Hillary Clinton and other Democratic candidates.Yet 2016 exit polls show the Democratic nominee was supported by only 51% of voters in union households, while Donald Trump captured 43% of those votes. The eight-point gap is a stark departure from 2012, when Barack Obama won union households by a whopping 18%. That same year, President Obama won Ohio's union households by 23 percentage points. In 2016? Clinton lost the state's union households by nine percent.Labor leaders' political focus points to the gradual evolution of unions from worker advocacy organizations to Democratic Party subsidiaries — increasingly beholden to Democratic elites instead of blue-collar employees. And it confirms the ever-growing divide between union leadership and their members. While Trump was cast as ""an anti-American bigot,"" the Republican nominee went on to win Ohio's union households by nearly double digits.Union political spending also transcends direct campaign donations in election years. According to newly released Center for Union Facts research, labor leaders sent nearly $530 million to Democrats and closely aligned liberal special-interest groups from 2012 to 2015 — 99% of their entire advocacy budget. The Democratic Governors Association received over $10 million, while Catalist — the Democratic Party's go-to data firm — raked in more than $7 million. Advocacy groups run by Al Sharpton (National Action Network) and Jesse Jackson (Rainbow PUSH Coalition) received hundreds of thousands of dollars in recent years.The $530 million in advocacy spending comes straight from member dues — still mandatory in non-right-to-work states — and theoretically reserved for collective-bargaining purposes. But current labor law permits union bosses to bankroll implicitly political causes while disguising it as worker advocacy. It leaves the substantial minority of union members who vote Republican footing a political budget in direct conflict with their beliefs.This democracy gap corrupts our political system. While union employees can affirmatively support or refrain from contributing member dues to liberal super-PACs, the same is not true of Big Labor's political advocacy budget, which funds left-wing think tanks and advocacy groups generally supportive of the Democrats' agenda. Under current labor law, union employees are essentially forced to support the National Action Network, Rainbow PUSH Coalition and others without giving prior approval.It's precisely why legislators have introduced the Employee Rights Act (ERA), legislation which would update federal labor law to protect employees from unapproved political spending. The ERA — now supported by 170 members of Congress — would require union officials to obtain opt-in permission from their members before spending dues dollars on political activities unrelated to collective bargaining. This would ensure workplace democracy where there currently is none. Unsurprisingly, the bill's political protection clause registers over 80% approval among union households.As Tuesday's protesters fight for ""worker justice,"" they should recognize that labor reform is the only way to achieve it.

32,AFL,"Billionaire Tom Steyer vowed to make climate change a major issue in the 2016 election. His plan was to link arms with the AFL-CIO to mobilize the Democratic base and recruit Millennial voters to rise up to defeat Donald Trump and put Hillary Clinton in the White House. He failed abysmally on every count.One might be tempted to feel pangs of sympathy for the man who is showing every sign of positioning himself for running for governor of California in two years and who presumably hoped his electoral heroics would make his star the shiniest among those Democrats aspiring to even greater heights.More's the pity that he spent so much of his own money in this failed effort. A lot of it. In fact, the hedge fund tycoon spent more money than any other individual in the 2016 election cycle. His crocodile-tear declaration in July that, ""We believe that there is too much emphasis on money in politics"" notwithstanding, Steyer and his super PAC NextGen Climate Action poured about $100 million into the election effort.The fact that most of that money came from Steyer's own checkbook suggests that climate change isn't much of a priority among other Democratic donors. Indeed, only 6% of Democrats listed climate change as their top concern, according to a Fox News poll of more than 1,000 registered voters taken just a year ahead of the election.Just 7% of Democrats identified climate change as the most important issue in determining which candidate to support for the party's presidential nominee in a February 2016 poll from Quinnipiac University. The New Republic calls climate change the biggest nonissue of this election cycle, noting how climate change was discussed for a scant 325 seconds in the presidential debates.Despite Steyer's spin suggesting this was the year for political action on climate change and that his army of millennials would push the issue over the top, Trump won one out of three millennial voters — 37%.  According to the Center for Information & Research on Civic Learning and Engagement (CIRCLE), 55% of voters aged 18 to 29 supported Hillary Clinton in comparison to Donald Trump's 37%. But Clinton had a poor showing in contrast to the 67% millennial voter support for Obama in 2012.In May, Steyer announced the formation of a new super PAC which would be a partnership between his NextGen Action and the AFL-CIO aimed at coordinating voter turnout efforts. But many union laborers were already furious with Steyer for leading the campaign to kill the Keystone XL pipeline and the thousands of high paying union jobs that went with it. Outraged officials from eight unions fumed that ""the AFL-CIO has now officially become infiltrated by financial and political interests that work in direct conflict to many of our members.""Terry O'Sullivan, president of the Laborers' International Union of North America wrote, ""We object to the political agenda of the AFL-CIO being sold to a job-killing hedge fund manager with a bag of cash.""Four years ago — before policies of Steyer's moneyed elite destroyed their jobs and caused green energy poverty by causing utility rates to skyrocket — union households supported Obama by an 18-point margin. In this election, their support for the Democratic candidate dropped a precipitous 10 points, with Clinton eking out an anemic eight-point lead within this traditional Democratic stronghold. In the end, rank-and-file union voters pushed Trump over the top in the critical states of Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania.This isn't the first time Steyer has failed spectacularly. During the 2014 midterm election, in which he was also the largest individual donor, he dumped more than $73 million in an effort in which very few of the candidates he backed won and in which climate change action actually dropped as a priority (from 37% of Americans before the election season to just 28% by election's end).With a track record of that kind of ""help"" Democrats would be well served to deliver one of Donald Trump's most famous lines on Tom Steyer: ""You're fired.""
"
33,AFL,"Labor unions have made a big bet on Hillary Clinton and her progressive agenda, having given her nearly $12 million — about 96% of the money they have donated to all presidential candidates this cycle. Unions have also funneled $64 million to outside, unaffiliated groups backing a liberal/progressive agenda in federal elections, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.But even as they spend heavily to influence Washington, unions are making large political investments to win tax increases and labor-friendly regulation in states. Their tool in many places is initiative and referendum, through which labor hopes to circumvent Republican domination of state capitals and the reluctance of moderate Democrats in some places to sign on to their agenda. The effort, led by public sector employee groups, solidifies their reputation as the most powerful force for bigger, more intrusive government at the state level.Oregon is a bruising battleground, as unions frustrated by a history of compromise by the state's Democratic Party are waging a campaign to win a massive increase in the minimum gross receipts tax a corporation must pay. They're sponsoring Measure 97, which would impose a 2.5% minimum levy on sales above $25 million for businesses.Under the proposed tax, to take one example, a corporation operating in Oregon with $70 million in sales would have to pay a minimum of $1.16 million to state government even if it did not earn profits--a more than $1 million increase over the current minimum tax, according to an analysis by the state's legislative review office. If successful, the referendum would raise some $2.5 billion a year and grow the state's general fund budget by as much as one-third.So far, unions have contributed $8.83 million of the $8.95 million raised by the campaign Yes on 97. The National Education Association has given $1.85 million, and its local affiliate, the Oregon Education Association, has contributed $1.75 million. Various units of the Service Employees International Union have added $3 million, while the American Federation of State County and Municipal Employees has kicked in $1.25 million.The most expensive union-backed ballot initiative this year is also the most cynical. In 2012 California Gov. Jerry Brown won support for a referendum to raise taxes by $7 billion when he promised that much of the money would go to education, and that the higher levies would expire in 2018. Voters increased both the state's sales tax and its income tax on those earning more than $250,000 annually.Soon after, the state hit school districts with massive increases in teacher pension contributions, draining away much of the new funding. So unions are backing a measure to extend the 2012 tax on rich Californians to 2030. ""There's a reason why we tax the 1%,"" Brown said. ""It's because that's a tax people have shown they are willing to vote for.""Not taking anything for granted, California unions have so far contributed $23 million to push the initiative, led by the California Teachers Association, one of the nation's richest public sector union locals, has alone donated $19 million to the effort.Maine has only 3% of California's population, but the East Coast State is the site of one of this election's most tenacious union tax-raising efforts. Frustrated by Republican Gov. Paul LePage's opposition to tax increases, Maine's teachers unions and their allies are looking to impose a 3% tax surcharge on incomes above $200,000 annually.Virtually the entire campaign is being funded by the National Education Association, which has given $1.25 million, and its affiliate, the Maine Education Association, which has contributed about $500,000 in cash and in so-called in-kind contributions. LePage has called the initiative, ""Just another attempt to extort more taxes from Maine families and businesses without improving education.""Maine is home to another ballot battle that epitomizes this year's union priorities, a campaign to raise the state's minimum wage. Several union-backed national groups have helped kick-start efforts in The Pine Tree State and in Arizona, Washington and Colorado. In Maine, where Question 4 would raise the minimum wage to $12 over four years, the principal contributor to the $1 million campaign is a California group, The Fairness Project, created by the Service Employees International Union to raise wages around the country.Another player in this effort is the New York based Center for Popular Democracy, backed by unions like the AFL-CIO and the National Education Association. In Arizona, virtually all of the $1.5 million in funding so far for Proposition 206, which would raise the minimum wage to $12 and hour by 2020 and require large corporations to guarantee 40 hours a year of paid sick time, comes from The Fairness Project and Living United for Change in Arizona, a local conduit for the Center for Popular Democracy.Similarly, in Colorado, the Center for Popular Democracy and the Fairness Group are the two top funders of Amendment 70, having contributed more than $1 million to the effort to boost the state's minimum wage to $12.Business groups hoping that these campaigns are an exception in 2016 are likely to be disappointed. With Democrats in control of the governorship and legislature of just seven states, compared to 23 for Republicans, unions and their allies have pledged to focus increasingly on so-called citizen-initiated ballot measures to circumvent unfriendly legislatures. These measures represent a powerful tool that labor is likely to employ increasingly in coming years, especially if this year's crop of union-inspired initiatives scores big in November.

35,AFL,"One of the criticisms of trade agreements such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) is that they are negotiated in secret.  Government-to-government discussions generally are conducted in private, so some confidentiality in trade talks is not surprising.  The AFL-CIO, an advocate for greater transparency, asserts that ""such secrecy is inconsistent with democratic principles"" and has the effect of advancing ""the policy preferences of political and economic elites, not the broad interest of the populace at large.""There is no doubt that transparency in government is a desirable goal.  Transparency helps to assure accountability, and at times might even lead to more efficient use of public resources.When it comes to trade talks, though, the question is:  How transparent can the negotiating process be and still have any chance of success?  This question is important because some people may be using the transparency issue as a smoke screen to cover up a different motivation, which is to make sure that efforts to reform trade policy do not succeed.Success in trade negotiations helps economies to grow.  Both Democratic and Republican economists agree that a country lowering its tariffs will experience improved economic welfare.  Consumers benefit meaningfully from tariff reductions, as do companies that utilize imported items in their production processes.  (About half of U.S. imports are used by manufacturers rather than going directly to consumers.)Other countries that export goods to the country with newly lowered barriers also receive modest benefits from the policy change, but those are smaller than the benefits accruing to the country that has liberalized its import regime.The U.S. trade negotiating process consists of three phases.  In the first phase, Congress provides negotiating authority to the president.  This was done most recently in June 2015 when Congress passed the Bipartisan Congressional Trade Priorities and Accountability Act.This legislation established a list of negotiating objectives that the administration should achieve in order for Congress to consider any trade agreements on an up-or-down vote without amendments.  Just like other legislation, interest groups and citizens may present their views on the bill to their elected representatives.  It is fair to say that this phase of the process is very open to public scrutiny and involvement.The second phase involves actual negotiation with one or more other countries.  These talks take place mostly in private, which is understandable.  Negotiators likely wouldn't be willing to discuss potentially challenging trade-offs unless confidentiality is assured.Every country has interest groups that would prefer no changes in its current policy regime.  Even if reforms help the country overall, some people will oppose parts of a deal.  However, a final agreement will contain more benefits than costs for each country; otherwise, the negotiation would never conclude.  Point-by-point public opposition to a potential deal while talks are ongoing could prevent a broad package from ever being put together.U.S. negotiators receive input from private-sector and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) through advisory committees organized by the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative.  These committees provide expertise on a wide variety of issues relevant to business, labor and the environment.The roughly 700 members of the advisory committees undergo background checks before receiving security clearances and obtaining access to confidential information. Participation by the advisory committees keeps negotiators apprised of the practical implications of policy changes being discussed with foreign negotiators.  So the actual negotiations may not be public, but they are well-informed.The third phase is congressional consideration of the final agreement.  The text of the agreement is made public relatively soon after completion of the talks.  Interested parties then can review it and decide whether it meets their approval.  The U.S. International Trade Commission completes an analysis to determine the likely economic effects of the agreement, which generally provides information that can support arguments by both opponents and supporters of the pact.Eventually the White House presents Congress with legislation to implement the agreement.  As with the first phase, this final phase requires Congress to pass a new law.  The degree of transparency is very high from the time the text is made public.  Anyone may weigh in to express an opinion, and many people do.So two of the three steps required for the U.S. to enter into a new trade agreement are highly transparent, but the actual negotiation with other governments is mostly private.Does this represent a reasonable compromise between a desire for openness in government and a desire to talk seriously with other nations about trade liberalization?  If not, how could the negotiation be made more transparent without undermining prospects for actually achieving an agreement?We must avoid letting transparency itself become a smoke screen for stopping progress toward trade liberalization.

36,AFL,"PHILADELPHIA — Many economists write off organized labor as a shrinking and increasingly irrelevant force in American life. And they may be right. But don't tell the labor movement that. If anything, it seems to be tightening its grip on the Democratic Party, something in clear evidence here at the Democratic National Convention.Building up to today's opening, the big mystery had been who would Hillary Clinton pick as her vice presidential candidate. When it was announced that her pick was Tim Kaine, the Virginia senator, many were disappointed. That's especially true of Big Labor.As Politico.com noted, as recently as last Thursday, Kaine was telling anyone who would listen that he favored the Trans Pacific Partnership trade deal. That put him starkly at odds with Big Labor, since killing TPP is probably the No. 1 item on the labor movement's agenda at the moment.Then a curious thing happened. On Friday, Kaine was named Hillary's running mate. And by Saturday, Kaine had transformed from being an admittedly lukewarm supporter of TPP to complete opposition, no ifs, ands or buts.He's also been a longtime supporter of right-to-work laws in his home state of Virginia. Don't be shocked if he reverses himself on that, too.Yes, it's no surprise that the Democrats are the party of organized labor. But on issue after issue, organized labor now sets the Democrat economic agenda in a way that hasn't been seen in decades.And remember: While Kaine's reversal was treated as a big victory, he has a lifetime 96% rating from the AFL-CIO on key votes. He's no Democratic enemy of Big Labor.His sudden switch mimics Hillary's own cave-in from proudly supporting the TPP — she was one of the Obama administration's most ardent proponents of the TPP talks and, after it was negotiated, bragging about it and calling it the ""gold standard"" of trade deals.And it's not just trade. Thanks to Bernie Sanders, who was tied at the hip with organized labor, the Democratic Party's platform contains a $15 an hour minimum wage provision, opposes right-to-work laws, and includes a ""card check"" provision that would ""direct the National Labor Relations Board to certify a union if a simple majority of eligible workers sign valid authorization cards.""So much for secret union ballots. Unions could just present cards they say were signed by a majority, and that's that.As for organized labor, it's over the moon about Kaine's conversion and the Democrats' incredibly union-friendly platform, which Sanders himself proudly noted is the most ""progressive"" in history.""Senator Kaine's decision to join Secretary Clinton in opposing the Trans-Pacific Partnership signifies the beginning of a new era,"" AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka said in a written statement. ""Driven by workers, it is clear that the Democratic Party, and the country as a whole, are now rejecting backward trade deals with a firmness that will establish a new standard.""And it's not just old-line industrial unions who like it. An ecstatic Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, tweeted that it was the ""the most progressive in American history.""Yes, the Democrats are full of love right now for the labor movement. In touching remarks, Boston Mayor Marty Walsh even credited the labor movement with helping him recover from alcoholism, saying that everyone had given up on him -- ""everyone except my family and the labor movement.""He was followed by a parade of labor leaders who lashed out at Donald Trump and the GOP, while singing Hosannahs to Hillary and the Democrats.Whether the Democrats can ride a movement that peaked as a share of the American workforce more than 50 years ago to victory in November remains to be seen. But make no mistake — when it comes to political clout, Big Labor is back, big time.

38,AFL,"Donald Trump, campaigning Tuesday at an aluminum scrap facility outside Pittsburgh, delivered perhaps the most combative anti-globalization speech of any major party standard-bearer in American history.""Our friends in Britain recently voted to take back control of their economy, politics and borders,"" Trump said. ""Now it's time for the American people to take back their future.""He pledged to immediately renegotiate ""a lot better"" terms for the North American Free Trade Agreement upon entering the White House -- or else withdraw from the pact.Trump also said he would end the U.S. role in the yet-to-be ratified Trans-Pacific Partnership.Finally, he vowed to label China a currency manipulator and warned that tariffs would follow ""if China does not stop its illegal activities.""The combative tone was not new. Throughout his campaign, Trump has harshly criticized companies like Ford Motor (F) for building plants in Mexico, while insisting that Apple (AAPL) would make its iPhones in the U.S., not China, if he is president.Yet Trump's speech, titled ""Declaring America's Economic Independence,"" was notable because it promised in such clear terms to turn back the clock on globalization and decades of deepening trade ties.What's more, his threats to blow up trade relationships come less than a week after Britons' surprise vote to exit the European Union. The U.K. economy has not even begun to feel the economic disruption to be caused by Brexit. A near-term recession is inevitable, economists predict.But Trump, rather than being alarmed by the likely fallout, is promising to follow Britain's lead in breaking the structures supporting the global economic status quo.""Our politicians have aggressively pursued a policy of globalization -- moving our jobs, our wealth and our factories to Mexico and overseas,"" he said. ""Globalization has made the financial elite who donate to politicians very wealthy. But it has left millions of our workers with nothing but poverty and heartache.""The presumptive Republican presidential nominee's no-holds-barred speech comes after a series of rough weeks. His campaign has seen Democratic rival Hillary Clinton show a solid advantage, not just in polling but in fundraising and organization. Still, Trump is in striking distance in the Rust Belt battlegrounds of Pennsylvania and Ohio, states that may be receptive to his anti-trade program.Clinton has tried to walk a fine line on trade, resisting taking a stance on the TPP deal before Bernie Sanders' insurgent campaign forced her to the left to shore up union support. On Tuesday, Trump used Sanders' line to make his case. Hillary Clinton, he said, ""voted for virtually every trade agreement that has cost the workers of this country millions of jobs.""Trump blamed Clinton for Nafta, signed by President Bill Clinton, and for her husband's role in paving the way for China's entry into the World Trade Organization. The latter move ""has enabled the greatest jobs theft in history,"" he charged.Even pro-trade economists acknowledge a significant loss of manufacturing jobs to China, yet much of the job loss is tied to increased productivity. The National Association of Manufacturers agrees that China has engaged in unfair trade practices, but the organization warns: ""It's a lot more complicated than the campaign promise of putting on new border taxes on Chinese imports, which we all know would be contrary to U.S. international commitments and would likely result in even stronger retaliation against U.S. exports to China.""Likewise, if Trump backed out of Nafta, that could raise the cost of autos in the U.S. that use engines or other components sourced from Mexico.Trump's embrace of anti-globalization rhetoric and the threat of tariffs as an economic weapon would be out of step even for a Democratic nominee, but it's a shock for the GOP establishment. House Speaker Paul Ryan, who backed the trade promotion authority that President Obama needed to complete the TPP, notes that America has just 5% of global consumers. At a recent fundraiser in Texas, a Laredo banker reportedly confronted Trump on the issue of trade, saying: ""I agree we need fair trade, and here in South Texas, Nafta meets the definition.""While some Republicans bemoan Trump's rhetoric as identical to that of Sanders or AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka, there are a couple of big differences. Trump also vowed to ""make America the best place in the world to start a business, hire workers and open a factory"" by lifting the ""crushing burdens"" of taxes on workers and business, and getting rid of wasteful rules and regulations.   
"
39,AFL,"In an annual ritual that takes place every May, the AFL-CIO releases its “Executive Paywatch” report to publicize what it considers to be the excessive compensation of the CEOs of America’s biggest multinational firms.The nation’s largest labor federation reports this year that the typical CEO running an S & P 500 firm received total compensation of $12.4 million in 2015 while the average rank-and-file worker was paid just $36,875 — a pay gap of 335-to-1.But the AFL-CIO can only get such an inflated pay ratio by applying a series of statistical sleights of hand that result in an invalid apples-to-oranges comparison of the total compensation for CEOs to the cash wages of mostly part-time workers.To start, the AFL-CIO only considers a very small sample of S&P 500 CEOs to get its 335-to-1 ratio. Using a larger, more representative sample of CEOs produces a much smaller pay gap.For example, the AFL-CIO’s own website reveals that the average CEO compensation of Russell 3000 companies was $5.7 million last year, which would cut the 335-1 ratio by more than half to only 155-to-1.Further, BLS data show that there are actually more than 20,000 chief executives employed nationally who “manage companies and enterprises” at an average annual salary of $220,700. For that more comprehensive group of America’s CEOs, the CEO-to-worker pay ratio drops to only 6-to-1.Then there’s the issue of average pay for rank-and-file workers. The AFL-CIO reports an annual pay figure of $36,875 in 2015 for the “average nonsupervisory worker,” but doesn’t provide any additional details.Here are the details not provided by the AFL-CIO.The $36,875 annual average worker pay for the 99 million “production and nonsupervisory employees” is based on an average hourly wage of $21.04 for rank-and-file workers in 2015, an average workweek of only 33.7 hours for those workers, and an assumption of 52 weeks of work per year. That’s how the AFL-CIO gets its reported annual pay for the average U.S. worker: $21.04 per hour x 33.7 hours per week x 52 weeks = $36,875.So every year, to get the highest possible pay ratio, the AFL-CIO does a statistically deceptive comparison of the total compensation for only 500 CEOs who are working full-time and in their prime earning years to the cash wages only for 99 million rank-and-file workers who are mostly part-time workers. But you would never know that from the AFL-CIO’s website because the details of average worker pay are never fully explained.How would the AFL-CIO’s outsized pay ratio change if we considered total compensation for both CEOs and full-time rank-and-file workers? To make the comparison as accurate as possible, let’s consider rank-and-file employees working a 50-hour week (even though most CEOs probably more than 50 hours a week) and receiving fringe benefits equal to 46% of their cash wages, which is the current estimate from the BLS for all workers.The total annual compensation for rank-and-file workers would be nearly $72,000 and would result in a CEO-to-worker compensation ratio of only 172-to-1. In other words, the AFL-CIO’s reported CEO-to-worker pay ratio is inflated by a factor of almost two times by comparing the total compensation of CEOs to the average cash wages for part-time workers.Beyond the statistical chicanery used to generate an inflated pay ratio, what’s the point of the AFL-CIO’s annual reports on CEO pay? The AFL-CIO tells us that although America is supposed to a land of opportunity, the rising CEO-to-worker pay gap means that “corporate CEOs have been taking a greater share of the economic pie” while wages have stagnated for the average worker. The message is that if CEOs weren’t being so generously compensated then rank-and-file workers would be making higher wages rather than getting only the leftover scraps.Let’s do a little experiment: The S&P 500 CEOs received $6.2 billion as a group in total compensation in 2015. If the AFL-CIO could confiscate that entire amount and redistribute it to the rank-and-file workers, how would that affect average worker pay?Each of 99 million rank-and-file worker would receive an annual increase in pay of only $63 before taxes, or about 3.6 cents more per hour. In other words, complete confiscation and redistribution of S & P 500 CEO compensation would make almost no difference in pay for rank-and-file workers.It’s not that surprising that the AFL-CIO would engage in an apples-to-oranges comparison to produce the highest possible CEO-to-worker pay ratio possible in its role representing union workers.But it is somewhat surprising, as IBD’s John Merline pointed out last year, that the mainstream media, politicians, and the general public never question the statistical legerdemain used by the AFL-CIO to produce the massively inflated pay ratio year after year.And while it’s true that some CEOs at the head of large multinational companies do command very generous compensation packages, there’s no support for the AFL-CIO’s rhetorical claim that this slice of the “economic pie” is what’s driving stagnant pay for some American workers.

41,AFL,"Party Politics: Every day there are stories about how deeply troubled the Republican Party is with Donald Trump as its presumptive candidate. But, if anything, the Democratic Party is in far worse shape.Think about it. Democrats still can’t decide if Hillary Clinton is electable -- in fact, her support has diminished as the primary season has dragged on. There are fears of a party revolt by Bernie Sanders supporters at the July convention, and there’s a huge rift forming between two of its major factions. Plus, polls show that the supposedly can't-possibly-win Donald Trump is now close to Clinton.The latest evidence of trouble came with Tuesday's primaries, where Clinton beat Sanders by a mere half a percentage point -- 46.8% to 46.3% -- in Kentucky, a state where in 2008 Clinton walloped Obama by 66% to 30%. Sanders beat her in Oregon by an almost 10-point margin.Of the past 20 primaries, Clinton has won only eight to Sanders' 12. And as the accompanying chart shows, her vote average has dropped sharply in the second half of the primary season, while Sanders' climbed. As a result, her lead among delegates today is actually narrower than it was back in late March.To make matters worse, 150 “superdelegates"" -- who can pick their candidate independent of any primary -- could put Clinton over the top right now by announcing their support for her but, as Bloomberg reports, they are still refusing to do so.Meanwhile, the party is increasingly worried that Sanders supporters, feeling they had the nomination snatched from them by a rigged system, could stage damaging protests at the party's convention, after his supporters turned a Nevada state Democratic convention into a chaotic mess.""Many Democrats fear that if Sanders does not rein in his supporters, the same ugly scene that occurred in Las Vegas last weekend could replicate itself in the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia,"" is how CNN put it.If that weren't enough, a major fight has developed between two of the Democratic Party’s most important constituencies -- rich environmentalists and labor unions. After the AFL-CIO announced that it was teaming up for a get-out-the-vote effort with billionaire climate-change fanatic Tom Steyer -- who helped block the job-creating Keystone XL pipeline -- several building-trade groups sent a blistering letter to Richard Trumka saying the AFL-CIO has ""now officially become infiltrated by financial and political interests that work in direct conflict to many of our members' -- and yes, AFL-CIO dues paying members' lives.""Terry O’Sullivan, head of the Laborers' International Union of North America, called the partnership a “politically bankrupt betrayal” of union members.As a result, ""Trump could well outperform Clinton with the unions that signed on to the letter, a heavily working-class and white male demographic,"" the New York Times reports.Trump is far from an ideal candidate, in our view, given his liberal bent and erratic personality, and his prospective nomination poses real risks to the Republican Party's future.But at this point, the GOP looks like a proverbial island of stability compared with the Democrats.

42,AFL,"The idea of American exceptionalism has been embedded in our collective DNA for generations. It is the faith-based belief that, as Ronald Reagan put it, America is a ""shining city on a hill.""Do modern liberals believe that?I almost never try to get into the other side's head or ascribe ill motives to those on the left. They are, I've always believed, misguided, not malign.But I'm having second thoughts after listening to Barack Obama's defense of communism/socialism when he was in Argentina. He advised young people to get behind ""what works"" economically -- as if there is some deep mystery here.Obama didn't misspeak. The modern left in America really has come to believe that communism, socialism, Marxism and totalitarianism -- or other terms for the monopolization of power into the hands of a ruling elite -- are superior to free-market capitalism.The president of the United States is supposed to be the global spokesman for free enterprise. But, instead of traveling to Cuba to point out to the world the decades of stagnation, deprivation and dehumanization at the hands of the Castros, and instead of using this moment in history to showcase the triumph of capitalism 90 miles away, Obama praises Cuba's health care and education systems.He might as well have been praising Mussolini for making the trains run on time. Even more unbelievable: The media applauded.How far the Democratic Party has fallen. Can anyone imagine Obama, Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders having the gumption or wisdom to tell Mikhail Gorbachev to ""tear down this wall""?It wasn't so long ago that leading Democrats -- JFK, Harry Truman and even the AFL CIO -- were staunch enemies of communism. Today, there is no place for such beliefs within the progressive Democratic Party. If it involves ceding power to the state, the left is all for it -- as evidenced by the rise of Bernie Sanders.But for every action, there is a reaction, and the left's lunacy has given momentum to the tumultuous uprising on the right this year. Millions of voters who support Donald Trump want our government to put America first and focus on our own mounting problems at home, then worry about Europe, Israel, the melting ice caps, AIDS in Africa and so on. If your house is burning down, you put out that fire and save your own children trapped on the second floor, before you go down the street and put the fire out at your neighbors' house.Here's just one observational data point that, admittedly, is anecdotal but speaks volumes about the left-right divide in America. At a typical Donald Trump or Ted Cruz rally, you will see American flags waving everywhere. These are patriotic gatherings. At Sanders events, you will see some flags, but not many -- because if you are a leftist, it's not cool to love America. What is much cooler is wearing a Che Guevera T-shirt.At a Republican rally, you typically meet many veterans who served our country with honor and valor. Some who protest at Trump rallies detest those who are wearing military uniforms and call them fascists and give the Nazi salute. I've seen it happen. I want to grab these brats and shout at them like Jack Nicholson did in ""A Few Good Men"": ""I would rather you just said 'thank you' and went on your way.""Trump voters see America losing both the economic and cultural wars vital to national survival. We have a $19 trillion national debt that has doubled in the past decade. We have wages flat or falling for most Americans. We have a political class that is actively trying to destroy whole industries -- coal production, oil and gas, community banks and so many others.We have a president (along with the intellectual class) pushing a radical climate change agenda that will cost the middle class millions of jobs, but won't change the global temperature by a hundredth of a degree. Trade deals seem to be drafted to benefit foreign workers and businesses over our own. America pays far more than its share for programs like the United Nations and NATO. Our public schools put teachers first, not kids, and they often don't adequately educate.We have courts overturning the will of the people in state after state on issues such as gay marriage. We have speech police. We have illegal immigrants who work here and live here and then wave the Mexican flag at rallies, as if to be intentionally offensive. (And I'm in favor of immigration.) Then they wonder why Americans want a wall.We have the TSA searching the underwear of infants but letting certain adults pass through without inspection because we wouldn't want to be accused of profiling. We have a Justice Department thinking about prosecuting people for questioning the climate change ""consensus.""This is the same crowd that seems to prefer the economic systems in Sweden and Greece and Cuba over America's. They preach human rights, but they don't seem to understand that economic freedom is a core human right.
"
43,AFL,"Clintonomics: Over the weekend, Hillary Clinton promised that as president she would put coal miners out of work and close down coal companies. As outrageous as that is, it's consistent with her history.Speaking Sunday night at CNN’s Democratic town hall in Columbus, Ohio, Clinton said, ""we're going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business."" She tried to wiggle out of the statement by saying these unfortunate Americans won't be forgotten. But people remember that candidate Barack Obama said that ""if somebody wants to build a coal-powered plant"" under his regime, they would be able to, but his policies ""will bankrupt them because they’re going to be charged a huge sum for all that greenhouse gas that’s being emitted."" So they know that Obama's war on coal will become Clinton's war on coal if she is elected.Backing policies that kill jobs is nothing new for Clinton. She wants to raise the federal minimum wage and is in favor of state and local governments hiking minimums even higher. The former secretary of state ""has also called for paid sick leave and some type of paid family leave,"" the Cato Institute's Michael Tanner wrote last month in National Review, and  supports ""the Obama administration’s push to expand the number of workers who would qualify for overtime pay.""""Maybe all this is a secret plan to support the robot industry,"" Tanner quipped to make his point that the policies Clinton favors will kick people out of their jobs and force employers to choose alternatives to flesh-and-blood workers.Almost a year ago, Clinton accused Republicans of putting American jobs at risk. But shortly thereafter, she proposed her ""growth and fairness"" plan, which includes tax increases, a higher minimum wage, rules on businesses that will force them to cut jobs, and infrastructure spending, which has been shown to be an impotent job creator.As we said just after she unveiled the proposal, it ""would be a job-destroying disaster for both the middle class and the poor she pretends to care about.""Going back a bit further, Clinton voted to extend unemployment benefits from 39 weeks to 59 while she was a U.S. senator. This seems humanitarian, but extending benefits actually causes higher unemployment. It eliminates the incentive to find a job.While senator, Clinton voted for the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, as well. The provisions of the law make it easier for employees to sue over phony fair-pay claims, which legal scholar Ted Frank says ""raises the expected litigation expense of hiring or retaining employees -- which in turn reduces hiring and wages"" and kills jobs.Clinton also has a history of supporting unions. The AFL-CIO gave her an 85% rating for her pro-union voting. Organized labor, however, does nothing to create jobs. It, in fact, suppresses job creation. It's in unions' interest to restrict the labor supply so they can drive up wages.Clinton likely regrets being so open with her comments. She tried to qualify them, but it was too late. They're out there, and now voters can put them together with her 2004 warning that ""we're going to take things away from you on behalf of the common good,"" as well as her history of getting behind proposals that choke job growth.The result is a candidate who appears -- and in fact, is -- out of touch with average Americans. She would gladly put 80,000 or so coal miners and another 40,000 Americans employed in coal-fired plants out of work to please the environmentalist constituency that monolithically votes Democratic. And she wouldn't stop there. She'll say and do whatever will get her elected and then re-elected, even if the predictable consequences are fewer Americans with jobs.

44,AFL,"Superstitious investors may be aware of the ""Super Bowl indicator,"" which says that if an original NFL team wins, the market will end the year up, but an original AFL win translates to a down year for stocks.Regardless of who triumphs on Sunday, these four names are likely to appear at the big game, whether at the stadium or in living rooms across America:The Swoosh is a recurring member of the IBD 50 and also the NFL's official outfitter, which means that both the Denver Broncos and North Carolina Panthers will be geared up in Nike on the field.Nike (NKE) remains, far and away, the market leader in sportswear, but Under Armour (UA) has been aggressively trying to capture more market share. Panthers quarterback Cam Newton endorses Under Armour. His Broncos counterpart, Peyton Manning, has a Nike endorsement deal.For the week that ended Jan. 30, Nike's athletic footwear sales fell 9.1% from the previous year, while Under Armour's jumped 70.5%, according to Deutsche Bank, citing SportScanInfo data.Shares fell 5% in the stock market Friday, hitting the lowest close since Sept. 15.The hawker of football jerseys and other sports apparel is another recurring member of this IBD hot list.Sterne Agee CRT noted in November that Foot Locker (FL), following a view-topping Q3, was ""clearly taking share"" from the likes of Finish Line (FINL), Hibbett Sports (HIBB) and others.Foot Locker stock fell 3.3% on Friday, moving back below its 200-day moving average.Fans are likely to put down a cold beer or three this Sunday.The parent of Corona Extra, Svedka vodka and Robert Mondavi trounced Q3 earnings last month, with Argus Research analyst John Staszak telling IBD in January that Constellation Brands (STZ) had a ""sensational quarter, driven by strong beer sales.""Constellation's in-development $1.5 billion brewery in Mexicali, Mexico, is expected to start operating in 2019. In addition, the company has a $500 million expansion in store for its Nava brewery, also in Mexico. And the firm bumped up earnings guidance for the year.Constellation is a favorite among top fund managers. Nevertheless, the stock sank 6.1%, tumbling below its 50-day moving average and closing below that level for the first time since late September. Constellation hit a record high on Monday but ended the week down 9.5%.Both victory and defeat will surely spill over onto social media after the game, and clips of Budweiser's Clydesdales and wacky Super Bowl ads are bound for Facebook (FB) and Twitter (TWTR).Facebook recently said that it intends to raise 2016 capital spending by about 70% to $4 billion-$4.5 billion.The company has also been working on turning social networking into social commerce as it develops M, a virtual personal assistant that can help make appointments or buy movie tickets. Facebook's Messenger platform can already hail a ride from Uber.Shares fell 5.8% on Friday, though Facebook found support at its 50-day moving average. Facebook hit a record high intraday Tuesday but ended the week down more than 7%.

46,AFL,"Economy: After eight years of talks, the 12-nation Trans Pacific Partnership trade pact is finally finished and ready for an up-or-down vote in Congress. President Obama's task just got tougher: selling free trade to a wary public.It's been heralded as a legacy-maker for President Obama — the closing of nearly a decade of 12-way negotiations between the trade star nations of the Pacific Rim led by the U.S.It will be the world's largest trade pact, encompassing 40% of the world's GDP with friendly nations such as Australia, Singapore, Chile, Canada and Japan at the center, along with closer ties likely with the others.It will slash 18,000 taxes on American products, making them more affordable for customers abroad — and more likely to create jobs here. And the proposed mega-bloc will most certainly serve as a counterweight to the influence of China, creating rules and standards that China can either follow to eventually join the club, or else remain on the outside and lose out on the benefits.Yet amid all the very real and likely results, it's going to be an exceptionally hard sell for the president. There's an atmosphere of disinformation and suspicion that his own party has largely fostered against free trade, business, banks and markets in general.And the upcoming election season will have politicians on both sides playing up to public fears and ignorance — just as candidate Obama did when he first ran for the presidency in 2008.That's the old bipartisan election game of the past few cycles — to condemn free trade, and then get to work on it when the economic benefits are realized.The bulk of the opposition comes from the left, which loathes free trade and, indeed, the very idea of freedom.""Wall Street and corporations have won again,"" growled socialist Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders, who without even reading it, called it ""disastrous.""Big Labor, another foe of free trade no matter what the particulars, cursed it, too. ""Now that negotiators have rushed to reach a final deal, the world will see how bad #TPP really is"" tweeted AFL-CIO labor federation boss Richard Trumka, also without having read it.On the right, concerns about President Obama's trustworthiness as a politician tended to draw opposition to the pact — more so than free trade itself.There may indeed be remaining issues hashed out around drug patents, pork imports, and intellectual property as this pact gets read over the next 90 days.But by and large, Congress will probably approve it warts and all if it's clear the benefits outweigh the costs. No trade deal is perfect, and any flaws can be corrected in coming years through future talks and legislation.To sell the pact to the public, Obama will have to overcome the public distrust of him based on his other failed promises — from ObamaCare to Iran — and walk back his earlier campaign rhetoric about ""bad trade pacts"" and ""timeouts"" on trade. That is, if he wants a legacy.In short, he'll have to sell the public on free trade as something good in itself. That's a tall order given the opposition to free trade he and his party have fostered.

48,AFL,"After a week of final talks in Atlanta, an agreement has been reached on completion of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a pact more than five years in the making designed to boost commerce among nations that produce 40 percent of global economic output, said Akira Amari, a Japanese economics minister who is in charge negotiations for his nation.U.S. President Barack Obama, who sees the pact as a key element in his ""pivot to Asia"" foreign policy, made the accord a top priority of his remaining years in office. China was left out of the agreement, which supporters promoted as a counterweight to China's growing influence.If implemented, the agreement would be the largest trade deal the U.S. has negotiated since the North American Free Trade Agreement took effect in 1994. The three signatories to that agreement — the U.S., Canada and Mexico — are included in this one, as is Japan.The agreement will provide duty-free trade on most goods and reduced tariffs on others. It will also provide mutual recognition of many regulations, including an exclusivity period for biologic drugs, which are derived from living organisms, and patent protection for pharmaceuticals. That was one of the final topics negotiators settled in marathon talks this week, as developing nations sought to have quicker access to generic medications.Canadian DairyNegotiators also haggled over issues including Canada's supply management system for dairy and other agricultural products, Australia's demand for additional access to the U.S. sugar market and regional value rules for automobiles and auto parts.Obama persuaded Congress to consider the measure under ""fast track authority,"" which means that it will be submitted for an up-or-down vote without amendments. Obama will have to notify Congress 90 days before he signs the agreement and publish the text 60 days before.The 12 TPP countries are Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, Vietnam and the U.S.""TPP is a comprehensive agreement that will open markets, set high-standard trade rules and address 21st-century issues in the global economy,"" the U.S. Trade Representative's office said in background documents.TPP will promote jobs and growth in the U.S. and across the Asia-Pacific region, and ""share American values and commitment to improve labor practices and elevate environmental standards around the world,"" according to the USTR.Supporters of the pact, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, argue that the TPP will make it easier to sell made-in-America goods and services overseas and to support U.S. jobs and economic growth.Opponents, such as the AFL-CIO labor organization, argue that it will lead to additional outsourcing of U.S. jobs. They are expected to pressure Congress to reject the pact.

50,AFL,"2016: In a bid to re-energize his presidential campaign, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker has proposed eliminating federal employee unions if elected. Good idea. Now how about a plan to get rid of a few federal agencies, too?In an op-ed written for a popular conservative blog — HotAir.com — Walker promised to take his union fighting credentials to Washington, and ban federal workers from joining unions.This is hardly as radical as it might sound. Federal workers only gained the ability to unionize in 1962, and even liberals like FDR understood the reason.""Meticulous attention should be paid to the special relations and obligations of public servants to the public itself,"" FDR said in 1937. ""The process of collective bargaining, as usually understood, cannot be transplanted into the public service.""AFL-CIO President George Meany made the same point in 1955, saying that ""it is impossible to bargain collectively with government.""The reason: Unions are ostensibly meant to balance the equation between profit-making companies and workers. But in the public sector, unions are bargaining with politicians who can simply spend other people's money to meet their demands.""Industrial unions are organized against the might and greed of ownership,"" liberal columnist Joe Klein once wrote. ""Public employees unions are organized against the might and greed ... of the public?""Is it any wonder, then, that having obtained the right to unionize, federal government workers now make 16% more, on average, than their private sector counterparts? The Congressional Budget Office found that, depending on the level of education, the federal pay gap can climb as high as 36%.But the problem with federal unions goes much deeper than excessive pay.For one thing, they're spending millions of man-hours and taxpayer dollars each year doing union work, instead of serving the public.The Office of Personnel Management calculated that in 2012, federal employees devoted 3.4 million hours to union work, costing taxpayers $156 million.Then there's the inflexibility, waste and mismanagement fomented by government unions. The unionized Transportation Security Administration, for example, is notoriously mismanaged.One audit found that it spent vast sums on an airport security system that fails 96% of the time.It's also virtually impossible to fire workers for even the most egregious problems. A Government Accountability Office report found that the government spent $3.1 billion from 2011 through 2013 on paid administrative leave — which often amounts to paid vacations for troublemakers in federal offices. More than 260 workers got at least a full year of paid time off.All this is to say nothing about the fact that federal unions politicize government, with the unions contributing almost all their campaign money to Democrats.So, yes, let's get rid of federal unions. And then go from there. If Walker is keen on going back to the pre-1962 ban on federal worker unions, why not also eliminate every Cabinet agency created after 1962?That list would include: Housing and Urban Development (created in 1965), Transportation (1966), Energy (1977) and Education (1980).None of these agencies is needed.HUD's main achievement to date has been the financial crisis. Test scores have fallen since the Education Department came into being. The Energy Department was created to cope with an ""energy crisis"" that no longer exists. And transportation spending decisions are best left to the states.Walker could make exceptions for the Department of Veterans Affairs — which by the way, didn't gain Cabinet status until 1989 — and Homeland Security, which was created by mashing together various existing government agencies after 9/11.In the meantime, though, let's hope other Republican presidential candidates pick up Walker's much needed union-busting campaign promise.

52,AFL,"Corruption: Senate Republicans are proposing to ban IRS workers from belonging to a union. Given the recent revelations of misconduct and possible criminality, this should have come much sooner.Tucked into a congressional bipartisan report on political interference at the IRS is a statement that — quite accurately — says ""it is virtually impossible for the IRS to maintain the reality, much less the appearance, of neutrality and fairness to all taxpayers,"" when so many IRS employees ""are members of the highly partisan and left-leaning National Treasury Employees Union.""We hope this proposal is the beginning of the dismantling of the IRS, a vicious government agency, more police force than tax collector. The political targeting of conservative and Tea Party groups under former official Lois Lerner is only a part of the IRS' sordid history.Lives of many ordinary Americans have been ruined by vindictive agents.Stories of ""the wrath of the unforgiving IRS"" and its ""abusive practice of conducting searches without a warrant and seizing assets without a trial"" are not new.Anything that begins to change the IRS' hostile behavior toward taxpayers and can lead to its ultimate dissolution is welcome. Who knows? It might just be the start of an effort to rid the entire federal workforce of unions.Government workers should never have been allowed to organize in the first place.Public-sector unions have no adversary sitting across the table from them during negotiations.The unions want more money, benefits and power, and policymakers, who supposedly represent taxpayers, give in to union demands because it's not their money they're handing out. And the clout they grant the unions is power they can share.Politicians also know that if they give in to organized labor's demands, they cultivate a voting block that will turn out for them on election day and give money.Franklin Roosevelt, known as a friend of unions, said himself that it is ""impossible for administrative officials to represent fully or to bind the employer in mutual discussions with government employee organizations."" Even AFL-CIO founding President George Meany understood government unions are a bad idea.The Senate Republicans' proposal will be one of the most intensely resisted ideas ever floated in Washington. But that recommends it.If Washington likes something enough to fight for it, that's usually confirmation that it needs to go.

54,AFL,"On Sept. 26, 1960, I stood by the television in a crowded prep school rec room. The competing voices of young men avoiding homework saturated the room with noise. Already a politics junkie, I had commandeered the TV and stood to its side where I could fend off would-be channel-changers.I was thus unable to see the flickering black-and-white images. No bother to a child of the forties, raised on radio. My ears absorbed every precious word of America's first televised presidential debate.Afterwards, regaling uninterested friends with the details of the important doings, I told them Richard Nixon had won.That night I learned an important lesson for later professional life: You don't listen to TV debates. You watch TV debates. Those who saw this new phenomenon knew the political truth. Words suddenly mattered less in choosing a commander-in-chief. John F. Kennedy had clearly won the image contest.United States politics were changed for better and worse ever after.Thursday evening the current 2016 Republican field will gather on-stage in downtown Cleveland in the same arena where one of them will accept the GOP nomination just 50 weeks from now. This time Fox News will host two debates, one at 9 p.m. ET with the top 10 ranked candidates according to recent polls and a second at 5 p.m. with the other, at this early point, lesser-known candidates.I wondered the other day how some pros and friends watch these things. So, I did what reporters do: I asked them. This morning below here in no particular order is the first batch of those responses.

62,AFL,"substance. Director, Center for Politics, University of Virginia.Hugh Hewitt -- I look for ""ah hah"" moments when unattached voters are either drawn to or repelled from candidates. There are lots of them and they usually are positive, not negative. Radio talk show host, Salem Network.Grover Norquist — I watch for who can thread the following needle....the temptation to zing Trump to make the evening news and the alternative strategy, to ignore Trump and make the case for themselves absent referencing Trump. What is the one thing each candidate wanted you, the target audience, to take away from the debate, what one sentence, visual, thought....and did they get that. Founder and president of Americans for Tax Reform.Sean Hannity -- America is in the midst of a dramatic decline with 93 million Americans out of the labor force, 50 million in poverty and 46 million on food stamps. On the world stage America's influence is almost non-existent. ISIS is on the move, the Iranians will soon have nukes, and neither Putin or China respect Obama.What America needs is a strong conservative president, (because conservatism works) who can articulate solutions to the American people, inspire them and win!! I hope that person emerges Thursday night. Fox News Channel host.Brooks Jackson -- FactCheck.org watches a bit differently. Rather than listening for ""oops"" moments, political gaffes or how polished or rough a performance may have been, we listen for factual claims that can be checked, either verified or not, or perhaps placed in a larger context....If Jeb Bush repeats his claim that he can produce four percent annual economic growth we won't be able to say he's wrong. We can't see the future any more clearly than other journalists. But if he says Florida experienced four percent growth while he was in office, we can say that's correct. And we can also say it's a fact that the growth was due largely to population growth and a housing bubble, which burst about the time Bush left office in 2007. That's what I mean by context. Director Emeritus, FactCheck.orgKarl Rove -- Much of what people think about debates comes from sound bites played afterward. But with social media, there is a debate about the debate taking place during the debate. There were 10.3 million tweets during the Romney-Obama debate in 2012. Imagine what will happen now with so many other platforms available and campaigns exploiting all of them.Finally, pay close attention to the personal impression each candidate creates. Appearing confident, comfortable, reassuring and knowledgeable can be every bit as important as saying the right things. Viewers are looking for a real person, not a performer.In 2000, friends of then-Gov. George W. Bush told him before debates to “be yourself.” Sounds simple, but it isn’t given the pressure and tendency to over-prepare. Still, letting the inner you out can be devastatingly effective. (Excerpted from Rove's column here.) Fox News Analyst, strategist and senior aide to President George W. Bush.Barack Obama in an email to supporters -- While these Republicans may have bad ideas, they're still smart politicians. They know how to make policies that will take us in the wrong direction sound like they might actually be pretty good ideas.That's exactly why I'm calling on you to tune in, listen carefully to what the Republican candidates for president say, and then hold them accountable for trying to undo all of the hard work we've done to move this country forward. President for 533 more days.Erick Erickson -- I want to see the other candidates in relation to Jeb Bush and Jeb Bush in relation to Rubio and Walker. They are really the front runners. How do they target each other and how much effort do they take to pretend the other candidates do not exist. Trump is the wild card. How does he try to throw them off and do the rest gang up on him, which would probably make him the winner. Editor of RedState.comBrad Jackson -- Some of these candidates had to scramble to get a spot on the stage for this debate. It will be interesting to see if they go after the GOP frontrunners, like Donald Trump and Jeb Bush, or if they direct their fire at Hillary Clinton, and the liberal policies she supports. Is this going to be a race to see who is the best nominee to face Clinton in the general election, or who is the best Republican among the party's primary voters? This first debate may give us an answer. Host of Coffee & Markets on WCGO Chicago and online at CoffeeandMarkets.comTim Farley -- Having been in the room for debates (and on the very hot surface of Soldier Field for the AFL-CIO event in August of 2008), and watched on TV, I kind of feel it's better to watch TV, because then as a reporter you see what America sees. 2016 is like 2007...we're waiting for Hillary, at this point no one in the administration is in the race, and a whole flock of people want your vote.The rehearsed one-liners are easy to spot--the crafted phrases intended to make the candidate's impression last a little longer than a slogan written in the sand. Typically, factual or policy faux-pas are more indelible.This year, Donald Trump drives the debate. So I'm watching for the strategy: high or low-engagement, ignore or attack, tolerate or condemn. Trump's like Mongo in Mel Brook's ""Blazing Saddles"": don't shoot him, it'll just make him mad. That's why the man to watch is Ted Cruz: a good debater, and someone who wants Donald Trump's leftovers.This debate won't win the Presidency. It will, I think, put a few campaigns on life support. Host, Morning Briefing, P.O.T.U.S. Channel 124, Sirius/XM Satellite Radio.Ed Morrissey -- These are the points I keep an eye on: 1) Gets substantial in a short period of time.

64,AFL,"It is stated so often that it's become an indisputable fact — CEOs make about 300 times more than the average worker, and that ratio has been increasing for decades.Hillary Clinton, for example, recently claimed, ""There's something wrong when CEOs make 300 times more than the typical worker.""President Obama said, ""Where a previous CEO of a company might have made 50 times the average wage of the worker, they might now make a thousand times or two thousand times.""News outlets routinely promote studies showing how outsized this ratio has become.There's just one problem with this figure. It's not accurate. Not by a long shot.As economist Mark Perry explains on his Carpe Diem blog , the commonly cited ratio that the AFL-CIO produced is the result of a several sleights of hand.According to the latest report, for example, CEOs are paid an average $13.5 million, while the average worker makes $36,134 — a ratio of 373 to 1.But the CEO number is based on data from only the 350 or so biggest companies, even though there are nearly 22,000 CEOs, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In other words, it's just looking at the pay for the top 2% of chief executives.The average pay for this broader group of CEOs is a much more reasonable $216,100, Perry notes, which works out to a 6-to-1 pay ratio.Perry also found that the average wage that the AFL-CIO used in its report is artificially low.In any case, a better way to measure this pay disparity would be to compare what a CEO makes to what workers earn at the same company.It's understandable why the AFL-CIO doesn't do this, since the resulting ratio for the top 100 companies comes out to just 84 to 1.What's not understandable is why the mainstream press keeps repeating the massively inflated 300-to-1 number without noting the statistical legerdemain that produced it.Follow John Merline on Twitter: @IBD_JMerline.

66,AFL,"Americans usually associate mid-April with tax filing — a trying yet predictable annual ritual. This year, however, it will mean a change in America's workplaces that will threaten workers' freedom of association and privacy, while hampering employers' abilities to respond to union organizing campaigns.The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) ""ambush election"" rule is set to go into effect April 14. The rule would drastically shorten the time period for union organizing elections, possibly to as little as 11 days after a union files a petition, giving employees little time to educate themselves on the pros and cons of unionizing.In March, both chambers of Congress acted to limit the NLRB's overreach and union coercion in U.S. workplaces. The House and Senate passed a rare, joint resolution of disapproval under the Congressional Review Act to stop the ambush election rule from going into effect.Although President Obama threatened to veto this legislation, it is important that our leaders challenge the NLRB and the administration on a regulation that will diminish the rights of employees and their employers.AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka argues that the rule is needed to ""help reduce delay in the process and make it easier for workers to vote on forming a union in a timely manner."" But the rule is a solution in search of a problem.What the NLRB is trying to address is workers rejecting union membership. Trumka is concerned about it because declining membership means fewer dues payments and less money in unions' political coffers.In 2014 total union membership fell to an all-time low of 11.1% and only 6.6% in the private sector. The unelected bureaucrats at the NLRB are doing everything in their power to reverse this trend, since the current NLRB members came from union backgrounds or exhibit obvious union bias in their rule-making.And the easiest way for the NLRB members to help unions increase their ranks is by limiting the time that workers have to contemplate the decision of unionization.Currently, the median election takes place in 38 days, hardly an unreasonably long time. According to the NLRB's own performance analysis report, union representation cases are handled at above the agency's own target rate.In FY 2014, nearly 96% of all initial elections were conducted within 56 days of the union filing a petition, but unions win more elections when employees have less time to educate themselves about unionization. From 2004 to 2014, unions won only 60% of elections conducted in 36 to 42 days but won more than 86% of elections conducted in less than 21 days, according to NLRB data.Not only does the ambush election rule allow workers little time to make a decision that will affect their wages and work environment, it also seriously threatens worker privacy. It compels employers to provide employees' contact information to union organizers, including personal cell phone numbers, email addresses and work schedules — without an opt-out provision for those who prefer not to share personal data.For too long, the NLRB has granted privileges to labor unions at the expense of workers, employers and taxpayers. Congress should keep up the pressure to educate Americans about the administration's desperate plan to expand its political power by boosting union membership and stifling workers' rights to free speech and privacy with the NLRB's ambush election rule. Kovacs is a policy analyst at the Competitive Enterprise Institute.

93,AFL,"Labor: A year ago, the United Auto Workers launched a high-profile campaign to unionize a Tennessee Volkswagen plant. But a majority of the workers said no. The UAW lost fair and square, but it won't take no for an answer.Many of the workers who voted down the union told local media they were worried that the union presence would mean lost jobs. They feared the UAW would turn Chattanooga, Tenn., into the next Detroit.Last summer, however, union bosses started agitating for another election. In other words, keep voting until you win.Once it became clear the union would lose a revote, they scuttled another embarrassing setback at the ballot box and looked for other alternatives.Next, they wanted a system under which the UAW would simply have to persuade a majority of workers to sign a card to certify the union — the ""we don't need no stinking elections"" option.It was a textbook reminder of why ""card check,"" something Obama fought for and lost on back in 2009, is such a horrid idea. Workers on the line vote very differently with a secret ballot than when they face the intimidation of signing a card thrust in their face by union thugs.After all, this is why we have secret ballots in America.But now, even with card check stalled, the UAW has established a ""minority union"" that lets Local 42 represent about 40% of the shop floor and meet with Volkswagen managers on behalf of these members.""This is starting to become a pattern that we're seeing around the country with unions that can't win elections,"" laments Mark Mix of the National Right to Work Committee.Under this model, the minority union, or ""work council"" as the left is calling the arrangement, negotiates contracts on behalf of only the workers formally represented by the union.If these were simply voluntary arrangements between a group of workers who want the union representation and the companies that want to negotiate with them, there would be no problem.But that's not the case.The National Labor Relations Board is now threatening to pass a rule — at the behest of the AFL-CIO — that would require companies to negotiate with these minority unions. So it's no longer voluntary, but coercive.The left calls this ""power sharing"" between company management and Big Labor.Worse, the game here is for these minority unions to browbeat nonparticipants into signing up and paying dues. Local 42 has made no secret of its desire to require VW to give it exclusive representation rights at the Chattanooga factory — and it claims to have more than 50% of workers on board.If the union can get VW to voluntarily recognize the UAW as the exclusive collective bargaining agent for all employees, it will have succeeded in doing an end run around the right-to-work laws.This is exactly the arrangement that a majority of Chattanooga VW workers rejected one year ago. The NLRB and union bosses are trying to engineer a back-door takeover of the negotiating rights of employees in the workplace, even if most workers don't want it.Democratic elections to certify a union or continue with an existing one is the last thing unions want.According to a recent study by Unionfacts.com, ""the percentage of employees that voted for their union (is now) 7.3%."" That's the real outrage of the modern union movement.Labor bosses are getting increasingly desperate, with the latest participation numbers showing that a record low 7% of private-sector workers are union members.Big Labor increasingly realizes it can only reverse this 40-year slide by strong-arming workers into joining their ranks.This is dangerous and undemocratic.And these are the people who say they stand for worker rights.

96,AFL,"2016: Liberals hope that the populist-sounding Elizabeth Warren will run to the left of Hillary Clinton, whom they fear is now too rich and out of touch. But Sen. Warren's financial records may dash their hopes.While making presidential noises, the Democrat senator has positioned herself as the Democratic Party's top defender of the working class.On Wednesday, she told the AFL-CIO in its ""Summit on Raising Wages"" that the system is ""rigged"" in favor of the wealthy.""The average family not in the top 10% makes less money today than they were making a generation ago. So who got all of the increase in income? One hundred percent of it went to the top 10%,"" Warren preached, sounding like a reincarnated Eugene Debs. ""All the new money earned went to the top. All of it.""And, as it turns out, a healthy share of it went to Warren herself. She's amassed a personal fortune bashing the rich — while insisting she's not one of them.Combing through her latest Senate financial disclosure filings, however, it becomes clear she is part of the same top 10% she rails against. In fact, her net worth puts her in the wealthiest 1%.The assets of the self-proclaimed godmother of the Occupy Wall Street movement and champion of the 99% include: Financial assets worth between $3.7 million and $10 million. Real estate assets worth more than $3.1 million, including a home in Cambridge, Mass., valued at $2.4 million and a condo in Washington valued at $740,000. A $525,000 book advance for her new memoir, ""A Fighting Chance."" At least 19 investment funds, including stock funds worth at least $1 million.Her large stock portfolio is odd, given her crusading against the ""excesses"" and ""greed"" of Wall Street. And it's downright unseemly, given her bashing of members of Congress who own stock.""There are some wealthy individuals — I'm not one of them — but some wealthy individuals who have a lot of stock portfolios,"" she told MSNBC during a 2012 campaign interview.During a senatorial debate, she jabbed her GOP foe Scott Brown for standing ""with the millionaires, not those who are out of work."" Turns out Brown was standing right next to one.Last summer, Warren ripped then-Senate Ranking Minority Leader Mitch McConnell for blocking a government spending program she proposed. ""Mitch McConnell is there for millionaires and billionaires."" Apparently he's also there for Warren, a millionaire many times over.Warren is even wealthy by Hill standards. Her minimum net worth alone ranks her 76th among the 535 House and Senate members combined.Yes, a lot of senators are richer than she is. But they haven't made a career of bashing the rich. Warren has a lot of nerve trying to pass herself off as one of the 99% for whom she claims to speak.The former Harvard professor claims she can relate to working and middle-class families better than other politicians, including Clinton. But she's just as out of touch.Warren has no debt, owns two posh homes and dines at the finest restaurants. She hasn't the foggiest notion about the pain the working and middle class are suffering from ObamaCare and other big government policies she pushes.For all her Marxist bunkum, Warren isn't even that altruistic. According to her 2009 tax returns, for example, she donated only 2% of her $980,670 income. She likes redistributing your money but not her own.Warren, who falsely claimed ""Native American"" minority status to score a high-paying Harvard gig, is not just a fake Indian. She's a fake populist, too.

97,AFL,"Is the economy rigged against the middle class? The Democratic left's dream candidate -- Sen. Elizabeth Warren -- thinks so.""I see evidence everywhere of the pounding working people are taking,"" Warren said on Wednesday at an AFL-CIO summit on raising wages. ""These families are working harder than ever, but they can't get ahead. Many feel that the game is rigged against them, and they are right. The game is rigged against them.""Her argument, of course, is that the government must intervene to level the playing field.But Warren must not be looking very hard if she can't see that the free market is rigged in favor of working families, not against them.As economist Mark Perry loves to point out on his Carpe Diem blog, market competition has dramatically driven down the cost of the goods and services we buy, while vastly improving their quality.In a recent post, for example, he shows how the efficiency of today's appliances is as much as 217% greater than what was available in 1981, which ""translate into significant energy cost savings for American households.""Better still, these appliances cost less than they did in 1981, especially when measured in ""time cost"" -- or how many hours the average worker would need to work to buy one.A 1981 dishwasher would have required 48.5 hours of work to buy, Perry calculates. A comparable dishwasher today requires just 17 hours of work. That's a 65% drop in price for an appliance which is more than twice as efficient.""Thanks to advances in technology and worker productivity,"" Perry explains, ""American consumers get cheaper and better manufactured goods (appliances, cars, clothing, food, and household furnishings) year after year, which translates into a higher standard of living for all Americans, especially for lower and middle-income households.""Does this look like a rigged game to you?If anything, the parts of the economy that are rigged against working families are those where government has intruded the most.As IBD pointed out recently, the states with the highest levels of income inequality also tend to be the most left-wing. Even the liberal Brookings Institution concluded that San Francisco is the second most unequal city in the country.Study after study has found that overregulation increases costs, kills jobs and stifles innovation. And it's always the middle class that bears the brunt of these adverse side effects.It's worth noting, too, that it has been under President Obama's tax-and-regulate economic policies -- most of which Warren heartily supports -- that middle-class incomes fell, millions quit looking for work, and millions more sank into poverty.Advocating a bigger dose of the poison is no way to cure the patient.Follow John Merline on Twitter: @IBD_JMerline.

102,AFL,"John Mackey's timing was perfect on a January afternoon in Miami 43 years ago.As the Baltimore Colts' star tight end sprinted across the Orange Bowl field in Super Bowl V, he saw quarterback Johnny Unitas throw a high pass toward midfield.Unitas' target was Eddie Hinton. But the ball caromed off the receiver's hand, flew high like a basketball off the back of a rim and grazed the finger of a Dallas defender.Mackey was ready. With his team trailing 6-0, he caught the deflected pass at midfield and raced untouched for a 75-yard touchdown.""That play turned the game around for us,"" said Glenn Ressler, a guard with the Colts, after Baltimore's 16-13 triumph.Mackey (1941-2011) was a game changer throughout his 10 years in the National Football League.At a time when most tight ends were blockers and short-yardage receivers, the 6-2, 230-pounder was a big-play threat, stretching the field with his speed and adding a new dimension to the game.Up And At 'EmIn his first season, 1963, Mackey averaged 20.7 yards per catch, scored seven touchdowns and was the only rookie starter in the Pro Bowl. By his fourth season, he had further boosted the tight end position, catching 50 passes and scoring nine touchdowns — including six of 50 yards or longer.He finished his NFL career with a 15.8-yards-per-catch average, a full yard better than Jerry Rice, widely regarded as the greatest wide receiver in football history.Ranked as the No. 1 tight end on the NFL's 50th-anniversary team in 1969, Mackey helped open the door for future athletic tight ends like Antonio Gates of the San Diego Chargers and other potential Hall of Famers who will kick off the 2014 season this week.""He was unlike any tight end in the league,"" Sam Havrilak, a running back and receiver on the 1970 NFL champion Colts, told IBD. ""He was a trailblazer.""Mackey changed the game off the field, too. During his historic tenure as head of the NFL Players Association from 1969 to 1973, he organized the first NFL strike in 1970, which resulted in $11 million in pensions and benefits for the players. Two years later, he won a landmark antitrust suit that would give the players free agency.""He never backed down,"" said Willie Richardson, a receiver and Mackey's roommate on the road.Mackey was born in New York City and grew up in Roosevelt, on Long Island, one of seven children.His father, Walter, was a Baptist minister who built his Long Island church with the help of his six sons. After every service, John had to sweep, lock up the church and escort choir members to their homes.In high school, Mackey was a three-sport star who idolized Syracuse running back Jim Brown.""I told everybody I was going to be like Jim Brown,"" he recalled in a 1980s interview.Sailing To SyracuseMackey turned down an appointment to the U.S. Naval Academy to attend Syracuse University in upstate New York. He studied political science, was an All-American and roomed with running back Ernie Davis, who in 1961 was the first black player to win the Heisman Trophy. ""When I got to Syracuse the coaches told me I could be a second-string running back or a first-string tight end,"" Mackey often said. ""I took one look at Ernie and became a tight end.""Mackey caught a few passes at Syracuse, but not enough to make him completely comfortable running pass routes.""He took great pride in his blocking,"" Richardson said.Yet the Colts selected him in the 1963 draft, confident that Mackey was a new kind of tight end.Mackey's self-confidence became apparent when he showed up for contract talks in a suit and with a lawyer and physician, a preview of the negotiating savvy he would employ as a union chief.""That was unheard of at that time,"" Richardson said. ""He was prepared from the beginning. It was all business with him.""After signing for less than $25,000 in his rookie season, Mackey earned about $500,000 over his decade in the league, according to the Chicago Tribune. He quickly took care of business on the field, earning the starting tight end spot in coach Dan Shula's offense.Catching OnFor decades, lumbering tight ends were used mostly like tackles. Their primary job was to clear a path for running backs. In 1961 Chicago Bears tight end Mike Ditka emerged as a bruising short-yardage receiver over the middle.Mackey introduced a new dimension to the position: speed.""Previous to John, tight ends were big, strong guys like Ditka and (Ron) Kramer, who would block and catch short passes over the middle,"" Shula told the Baltimore Sun. ""Mackey gave us a tight end who weighed 230, ran a 4.6 and could catch the bomb. It was a weapon other teams didn't have.""In 1966, six of Mackey's nine touchdown receptions came on plays of 51, 57, 64, 79, 83 and 89 yards.""Once he catches the ball, the great adventure begins,"" said Colts assistant coach Dick Bielski.Mackey also had the strength to cast aside would-be tacklers like lightweight teens. Colts broadcaster Chuck Thompson said it took three players to bring him down: ""The lucky ones fall off.""For that 64-yard touchdown in 1966, in Detroit, Mackey caught a pass on the outside, broke one tackle, escaped from the clutches of three more defenders who appeared to have him stopped, ran over yet two more players and outraced the rest of the Lions.""Four or five guys bounced off him,"" Richardson said. ""He wouldn't go down. I was trying to block for him, and he ran over me.""Mackey was the dominant tight end in the league from 1966 to '68, when he caught 150 passes for 2,159 yards and 17 touchdowns and was named first-team All-Pro each season. During his nine years with the Colts, they were perennial contenders and finally won it all with that victory against the Cowboys to culminate the 1970 season.The Colts and Mackey seemed particularly unbeatable in 1968, going 13-1. Yet they ran into Joe Namath and the New York Jets, who shocked Baltimore 16-7 in the Super Bowl.""I remember feeling like I wanted to dig a hole and hide,"" Mackey said a few years after that January 1969 upset.The next year, Mackey became union chief. Until he came along, the NFL Players Association was little more than a social club that hired lawyers to do the hard work. But as the first president after the NFL-AFL merger, he was all business. He hired administrators, a general counsel, brought stability to the union's day-to-day operations — and raised the ire of owners. At one bargaining sessions, he showed up in a purple jump suit.""Why are you wearing that thing?"" one owner asked.""Why are you wearing white socks?"" Mackey replied.""Because I like white socks,"" came the answer.""I like this purple suit,"" Mackey calmly said.The static didn't end there. When Mackey showed up for the Colts' training camp in 1970, he found himself temporarily demoted to second string.""I guess that was their way of teaching me a lesson,"" he said.Even Baltimore fans booed him that season. And Mackey's right knee, healing slowly from an operation for the removal of bone chips, limited his mobility and caused him intense pain up until the Super Bowl.Yet he came up with the catch of his career against the Cowboys. ""I knew it was my turn,'' he said.After retiring following the 1972 season with San Diego, Mackey ran successful businesses. He and his wife, Sylvia, had three children.Despite his brilliant career, Mackey was snubbed by Hall of Fame voters until 1992, his final year of eligibility, reportedly because of his union activism.During the last 10 years of his life, Mackey suffered from frontotemporal dementia, an affliction similar to Alzheimer's disease. Overwhelmed with the expenses of caring for her husband, Sylvia Mackey appealed to NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue for help. The NFL and its players union responded by creating the 88 Plan — named for Mackey's number — which provides up to $88,000 a year for care and treatment of former players with dementia.""He was a trailblazer to the end,"" Richardson said.

103,AFL,"Regulations: Well, well. Another big union has publicly declared that its members are the real front-line victims of the Obama administration's war on domestic energy production.The International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers came out with guns blazing this week against the Environmental Protection Agency's proposed Clean Power Plan.In a press release, it warns what we've been saying about these economically masochistic carbon emission regulations from the start: ""They will kill more than 150,000 good jobs while having a minimal effect on global greenhouse emissions.""Their words, not ours — and driven home time and again in IBEW testimony at EPA field hearings in opposition to the new regulations.""America needs an energy plan that balances the environment, the economy and jobs,"" said the union's president, Edwin Hill. ""But the EPA's poorly thought-out rule will do nothing but kill vital jobs and threaten the reliability of the electrical grid, hurting customers and businesses.""The union also took a well-aimed shot at the green energy fad that has Democrats and their rich green donors so enraptured.""Despite the growth of renewable energy in the last decade, solar and wind still provide less than 5% of the country's electricity,"" the electrical workers union press release stresses.""Shutting down dozens of coal plants in a short amount of time makes it difficult for utilities to keep the power on during bouts of extreme weather, like last winter's polar vortex system, which produced sustained periods of frigid temperatures.""A gutsy statement — and right on.The IBEW has now joined the United Mine Workers of America, the Boilermakers and several other unions opposed to the new anti-carbon rules.IBEW says the Obama administration has consistently underestimated the cost of ""climate legislation"" while green energy advocates routinely lowball the economic costs.This kind of fissure within the Democratic ranks could be highly disruptive to the long-term agenda of the left.Phil Kerpen, an expert on the green movement and president of American Commitment, thinks ""union workers are waking up to the reality that anti-development, anti-jobs greens are their natural enemies.""They won't tolerate EPA regulations that destroy hundreds of thousands of jobs just so San Francisco and New York City billionaires can have a green feeling of self-satisfaction.""Nor should they.Instead they should work with Republicans and moderate Democrats to kill these senseless rules.Sadly, many unions, including the United Auto Workers, are still drinking the Kool-Aid of ""green jobs."" What a farce.Back in 2008 and 2009 the Blue-Green Alliance — a pact between environmental groups and union bosses — promised hundreds of thousands of new green jobs. But the jobs never arrived, thanks to the lower price of natural gas and a cascade of renewable-energy company bankruptcies.Sadly too, many labor bosses have been bought off by a green movement that's on a mission to de-industrialize America and bury capitalism. The unions complicit in this agenda are like the condemned man who sells rope to the hangman.Bravo to the electrical workers union for publicly denouncing a radical green agenda that will end badly for members and families whose livelihoods depend on these jobs.It would be nice to see other unions, including the AFL-CIO, join this fight to save the jobs before it's too late.

104,AFL,"Unions: The AFL-CIO's decision to open membership to nonunion workers exposes what it's been for many years — a hard-core left-wing advocacy group often at odds with the real needs of workers. Witness ObamaCare.
"
105,AFL,"'We are in crisis, and we have to do things differently,"" AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka explained to USA Today.
"
106,AFL,"There's no doubt about the crisis part. The AFL-CIO has been hemorrhaging members. Over the past two years alone, it lost more than 170,000, and it's down more than 34% since the late 1970s.
"
107,AFL,"That tracks the overall decline in union membership, which has dropped from 20% of the workforce in 1983 to less than 12% now.
"
108,AFL,"When you take out public unions, which have managed to retain most of their forces, the drop in private-sector membership has been precipitous. Membership has fallen 24% since 2000, and union members now account for a mere 6% of private-sector employees.
"
109,AFL,"To counter this decline, AFL-CIO officials decided at their annual convention this week to invite anyone to join, union worker or not, as long as they're left-wing.
"
110,AFL,"""It's important for us to come together,"" Trumka said, ""to function like the majority we are, rather than little silos that can be marginalized.""
"
111,AFL,"But as far as ""doing things differently,"" what's changed? The AFL-CIO long ago became little more than a massive fundraising and lobbying arm pushing the Democratic Party farther left. Unions had four full years under Obama to push their leftist agenda, first with the stimulus, then with tax hikes, Dodd-Frank, union-friendly regulations and ObamaCare.
"
112,AFL,"And how have workers fared? They've seen wages stagnate, household incomes decline and union membership fall even further.

113,AFL,"The most blatant example of misguided priorities was the AFL-CIO's aggressive campaign on behalf of ObamaCare — a law that union leaders themselves now admit won't help union workers.

114,AFL,"On Wednesday, in fact, AFL-CIO members may have a chance to vote on a resolution that officially lays out, as The Hill newspaper put it, ""a laundry list of complaints against ObamaCare.""

"
116,AFL,"The AFL-CIO is late to this union ObamaCare-bashing game. The roofers union called for ObamaCare's outright repeal. The presidents of the Teamsters, the UFCW and UNITE-HERE wrote to the Democratic leaders in the House and Senate complaining that ObamaCare threatens to ""destroy the very health and well-being of our members.""
"
117,AFL,"And last week, the 40,000-member-strong International Longshore and Warehouse Union quit the AFL-CIO over its role in making ObamaCare a reality.
"
118,AFL,"None of these complaints should have surprised any of these unions. ObamaCare's conservative critics were pointing out how the law would kill jobs, run up health costs and encourage employers to drop coverage.
"
119,AFL,"That the unions didn't warn their members of these ill effects back in 2009, when they could have made a difference, is a clear dereliction of duty.
"
120,AFL,"So here's a modest proposal for the AFL-CIO today. Instead of fruitlessly whining about ObamaCare while embedding itself still more deeply with pro-ObamaCare left-wing groups, it should team up with conservatives to overturn ObamaCare entirely, and replace it with genuine market-based reforms that will lower costs, create jobs and improve the quality of care.

147,AFL,"Aflac Incorporated (AFL  -  Free Report) has been on a bit of a cold streak lately, but there might be light at the end of the tunnel for this overlooked stock. And for technical investors there is some hope when looking at AFL given that, according to its RSI reading of 28.94, it is now in oversold territory.What is RSI? RSI stands for ‘Relative Strength Index’ and it is a popular indicator used by technically focused investors. It compares the average of gains in days that closed up to the average of losses in days that closed down; readings above 70 suggest an asset is overbought, while an RSI below 30 suggests undervalued conditions are present.Other FactorsYet, AFL’s low RSI value isn’t the only reason to have some optimism over a coming turnaround, as there has been plenty of positive earnings estimate revision activity as of late. This is especially true when investors take a deep dive into some of these estimate revision stats and recent changes to Aflac’s earnings consensus.Over the past two months, investors have seen 1 earnings estimate revisions moved higher, compared with none lower, at least when looking at the key current year time frame. And the consensus estimate for AFL has also been on an upward trend over the past 60 days, as estimates have risen from $3.95/share two months ago to just $3.97/share right now.If this wasn’t enough, Aflac also has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy)which puts it into rare company among its peers. So, given all of these factors, investors may want to consider getting in on this stock now (or holding on), as there are some favorable trends that could bubble up for this stock before long.

148,AFL,"Reinsurance Group of America, Incorporated (RGA  -  Free Report) has been witnessing southbound revisions of late. The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings being revised 7.3% downward while for 2019, the consensus mark moved nearly 0.4% south.The stock carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) with an unimpressive VGM Score of C. Back tested results show that stocks with a favorable VGM Score of A or B when combined with a bullish Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), comfortably outperform other stocks.Shares of Reinsurance Group have lost 8.9% year to date, slightly narrower than the industry’s decrease of 10.5%. Although the stock has performed comparatively better than the industry in the above-mentioned time frame, we are apprehensive about its share price movement going forward based on the headwinds faced by the stock that we will discuss below. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.   What’s Ailing the Stock?Rising Expenses: Reinsurance Group has been incurring rising expenses over the past few years, primarily due to higher claims and other policy benefits, policy acquisition costs and other insurance expenses as well as interest expenses. The life insurer witnessed the metric increase 5% over the past five years. We do not expect any major turnaround in this respect in the near term. It is important to note that escalating expenses are likely to restrict operating margin expansion, which in turn might hurt the company’s overall growth.Weak Australian Business: Additionally, the company’s Australian business has been displaying weak performance over a considerable period of time, mainly due to competitive direct and reinsurance markets, complex product designs, softening claims experience and increasing legal activity. We continue to anticipate a certain level of volatility in this business in the near term.Dwindling Cash Flows: Moreover, Reinsurance Group’s cash flow from operations has also been on the wane over an extended period of time and we expect volatility in this metric to continue in the short term. Dwindling cashflows might restrain the company’s financial flexibility.Low ROE: Return on equity — a measure for comparing a company’s profitability — stands at 8%, noticeably below the industry average of 12.1%. Also, the company’s long-term growth is 9%, much lower than the industry’s 11.9% tally.Choosing the StocksWhile Reinsurance Group appears far from being an attractive pick right now, there are a few good solid stocks in the insurance space, which promises greater returns to fill in pockets with. Also, these companies have outperformed the industry’s rally so far this year.We have narrowed down to four investor-friendly stocks with an upside potential to enhance one’s portfolio by means of Zacks Stock Screener. Our search is refined by using a robust Zacks Rank, northward estimate revisions and a commendable VGM Score of A or B.

You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Shares of Cincinnati Financial have also underperformed the industry year to date. The stock has lost 8.1%, massively wider than the industry’s 2.3% decline.  Further, valuation remains stretched at the current level. Looking at the company’s price-to-book ratio, the best multiple for valuing insurers, the company has a trailing 12-month P/B ratio of 1.42, higher than the industry average of 1.41.Cincinnati Financial has been incurring rising expenses over the past few years, primarily due to higher insurance loss and contract holders’ benefits besides underwriting, acquisition and insurance expenses. We do not expect any major turnaround in this respect in the near term. It is important to note that escalating expenses are likely to restrict operating margin expansion, which in turn might hurt the company’s overall growth.Additionally, the company with its concentration on the Midwest region has been exposed to devastating events. To that end, it has been experiencing high level of catastrophe loss over a considerable period of time and will continue to endure the same given the unpredictability of weather-related occurrences and natural disasters. Further, such huge losses have also induced deterioration in the company’s combined ratio, hampering underwriting profitability.Moreover, Cincinnati Financial’s cash flow from operations has also been on the wane over an extended period of time and we expect volatility in this metric to continue in the near term.

153,AFL,"Aflac Inc.’s (AFL  -  Free Report) second-quarter 2017 earnings of $1.83 per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 12.3% and increased 7% year over year.Better-than-expected results were driven by favorable performance from the company’s U.S business along with share buyback.Total revenues remained unchanged year over year at $5.4 billion and fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.48 billion.Return on equity was 16.5%, up 50 basis points year over year.Aflac Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Aflac Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Aflac Incorporated QuoteSegments ResultsAt its Japan segment, premium income, net of reinsurance agreements, decreased 2.7% year over year to $3.2 billion. Net investment income, net of amortized hedge costs, decreased 7.9% to $557 million, due to lower reinvestment rates and increased amortized hedge costs.Total revenue declined 5.7% year over year to $3.8 billion. Pretax operating earnings decreased 1.4% to $791 million. Growth rates in Japan for the second quarter were suppressed as a result of a weaker yen/dollar exchange rate.The company’s U.S. segment reported a 1.9% year-over-year increase in premium income to $1.4 billion. Net investment income increased 2.3% year over year to $180 million.Total revenues increased 2.1% year over year to $1.6 billion. The pre-tax operating profit margin for the U.S. segment was 21%, up 200 basis points year over year.  In this segment, the company expects a long-term compound annual growth rate of 3% to 5% in new annualized premium sales.Dividend and Financial UpdateThe company spent $800 million on buying back shares in the first half of the year. At the end of the quarter, the company had 15.6 million shares available for purchase under its share buyback authorization.The company announced 43 cents quarterly dividend which will be paid on Sep 1, 2017, to shareholders of record at the close of business on Aug 23, 2017.Guidance Affirmed  The company kept its guidance intact. It expects to buy back $1.3–$1.5 billion worth shares in 2017. EPS is estimated between $6.40 and $6.65, assuming an average exchange rate of 108.70 yen to the dollar in 2016.If the yen averages 105–115 to the dollar in the third quarter, operating earnings, a non-U.S. GAAP measure, will be approximately $1.51 to $1.69 per diluted share.Our TakeAflac’s second-quarter earnings reflected strength in its U.S operations. Company-wide agent distribution, new product launch and ongoing investments in this segment will propel further growth.Nevertheless, Aflac continues to suffer from low interest rates in its Japan business and though major changes have been made in product mix to address this, currency woes persist. We, therefore, believe that the segment will remain under pressure in the next few quarters.Zacks Rank and Other ReleasesAflac carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

154,AFL,"The second-quarter earnings season is picking up pace with 26% members of the elite S&P 500 Index having reporting quarterly numbers already. Per the latest second-quarter scorecard, the performance of 128 index members (accounting for 36.1% of the index’s total market capitalization) that have already reported their financial numbers this quarter, indicate that total earnings have increased 7% on 4.2% higher revenues. The beat ratio is impressive with 77.3% companies surpassing the bottom-line expectations and 70.3% outperforming on the top-line front. (For more information, please consult our Zacks Earnings Analysis).The Finance sector’s results (one of the 16 Zacks sectors) have not been very impressive, but aren’t too disappointing either. Of the sector’s total market cap in the S&P 500 index, 54.1% that have reported quarterly results show 7.4% earnings growth on 5.4% increase in revenues, both on a year-over-year basis. The beat ratio of 82.9% for bottom line and 68.6% for top line is higher than the beat ratio of the S&P 500.  The insurance industry is part of the broader Finance sector. Let’s see how the second quarter has turned up for insurers.Results of insurers exposed to catastrophe losses will witness a dent in underwriting margins on account of several catastrophe losses that occurred during the quarter under review. Per Aon Benfield, the global reinsurance intermediary and capital advisor of Aon plc (AON), catastrophe losses suffered globally is estimated at $53 billion in the first half of 2017.  Some insurers have estimated catastrophe losses in the second quarter stemming from severe wind and hail catastrophe events during April and May in the U.S.The Allstate Corp. projects $627 million (pre-tax) in catastrophe loss while Kemper Corporation estimates the same between $32 million and $38 million.Another component of insurer’s top line, net investment income, has witnessed improvement, but still remains below historical levels, owing to still-low interest rates.Nevertheless, the recent increase in interest rates by the Fed should offer some respite to life insurers that suffered spread compression on products like fixed annuities and universal life due to persistently low rates. Annuity sales too should benefit from higher rates. Nonetheless, life insurers have considerably lowered their exposure to interest-sensitive product lines.Top line may also benefit from an improving economy and revived consumer sentiments which may lead to increased demand for insurance products.On the flip side, pricing woes linger. Insurers having fat capital reserves are fighting hard to gain business in a highly competitive environment and one of the most common ways to achieve underwriting targets is by lower pricing. Certain lines of insurance – commercial property, workers’ compensation and general liability are mostly experiencing soft pricing.Nonetheless, core business growth, geographic expansion, mergers and acquisitions and prudent capital deployment via share repurchase are like to benefit insurers.Let’s peek into these five insurance companies that are gearing up to report their second-quarter results on Jul 27.Aflac Inc. (AFL  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% as the Most Accurate estimate of $1.63 is in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.

It surpassed expectations in three of the last four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 0.85%.Aflac’s Japan business is expected to benefit from an increase in third-sector sales given the company’s emphasis on promoting these products which are less interest rate sensitive and carry strong and stable margins.  In its U.S. business segment, we expect to see improved persistency, which in turn should support premium growth. The company will, however, incur high cost on account of its Japan branch conversion (read more: Will Changing Business Strategy Aid Aflac Q2 Earnings?).Aflac Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise Aflac Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise | Aflac Incorporated QuoteThe Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. (HIG  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% as the Most Accurate estimate of 95 cents is in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Hartford Financial has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). We caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Last quarter, Hartford Financial, missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.96%. In two of the last four quarters, Hartford Financial missed expectations. It has an average negative earnings surprise of 9.41% of the last four quarters.We expect Hartford Financial’s results to be supported by improved performance of its Personal Auto business. Commercial Lines in small and middle markets are likely to perform well, boosting both the top and the bottom lines, continuing the previous quarter’s trend. The Group Benefit and Mutual Funds segment will likely deliver a solid performance, reflecting the company’s claims expertise and improvements made in its book of business over the years (read more: Hartford Financial Q2 Earnings: What's in the Offing?).Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc.

The company exceeded earnings estimates in three of the last four quarters with an average positive surprise of 0.85%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Q2 Flashback    Aflac has huge exposure to the life insurance business in Japan and has thus been suffering from a persistent low interest rate in the region. The same is expected to have impacted earnings in the to-be-reported quarter.Nevertheless, sales from this segment will benefit from an increase in third-sector sales given the company’s emphasis on promoting these products which are less interest rate sensitive and carry strong and stable margins.  Also, the introduction of third-sector products such as a cancer insurance product early last year, revised EVER and get products in the first quarter have been well received in the market place and will contribute to top-line growth.  On the other hand, the company’s efforts in pulling out first-sector products and repricing other products in this category to fight the prolonged low interest rate environment may continue to restrict their sales..  In its U.S. business segment, we expect to see improved persistency, which in turn should support premium growth. The segment’s expense ratio is expected to remain high due to investments in a certain platform, including group administrative platform, enrollment platform and related technology.However, the company’s continuous efforts to return capital to its shareholders via share buyback will cushion its bottom line.The company will, however, incur high cost on account of its Japan branch conversion.Aflac Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise Aflac Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise | Aflac Incorporated QuoteEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Aflac is likely to beat on earnings this quarter.

"
196,AFL,"NewMarket  fell to a Zacks #2 Rank (buy) stock today after many months as a Zacks #1 Rank. This comes after its less than spectacular earnings last week where it beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by only 2 cents. Estimates have weakened for the quarter but are higher for 2010, for now. We are watching this holding closely but feel that most of the sell-off from the earnings has been priced in.Perrigo Co. (PRGO  -  Free Report) saw shares spike 3.89% after reporting record results for the fiscal second quarter. Earnings of 70 cents per share, surpassed last year's 46 cents and exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 64 cents. Revenue of $583 million came in 9% ahead of the year-prior $537 million. Management noted that the company delivered all-time record quarterly revenue and earnings, and record second quarter cash flow, adding that the Consumer Healthcare, Rx, and API segments all contributed to the strong performance.

"
201,AFL,"A Growth and Income DeletionLubrizol (LZ) was deleted from the Growth & Income portfolio after the close. The company is due to report earnings on Feb 4, however, over the past several quarters it has been preannouncing better-than-expected preliminary earnings results. The company has not done that this quarter. Maybe it means nothing, but given NewMarket's results last week it seems ominous. Estimates are also weakening slightly for 2010. Given our large profit in the stock of over 65%, we're going to lock in our gains. We added the stock to the portfolio on May 21, 2009 at $43.87. It was removed after the close on Feb 2.

202,AFL,"Fourth-quarter GDP, which is set for release this Friday (1/29/10), is expected to show that the US economy expanded by 4.5%, but growth prospects for the US are expected to normalize as we move further into the year and beyond to a slower pace closer to 2% per annum, rather than the more historical 3%. 
"
203,AFL,"One of the reasons for the projected slower growth rates is the across-the-board de-leveraging we're seeing from businesses to individual households.
"
204,AFL,"Businesses in general will find it harder to acquire credit/financing to expand their businesses. And consumers will find it tougher to afford all of the goods and services desired.
"
205,AFL,"And while small-cap companies with innovative products and solutions will always have an audience, I believe the larger, stable and more solid companies will start to gain additional attention and become sought after holdings. 
"
206,AFL,"Many larger companies are large because they have an established and loyal customer base with widespread usage of their products. In turn, they see steady and sustainable growth for their business. Financing is unlikely an issue for their operations. And they likely generate a great deal of cash. 
"
207,AFL,"But that's not all. A lot of the big name companies will also pay their investors a nice dividend.  
"
208,AFL,"And as different investment vehicles compete for investors' cash in this expected lower growth environment  the companies offering 'a little extra' (dividends) could have an edge. 
"
209,AFL,"What's interesting is that a lot of companies have cut their dividends while others have stopped paying them altogether, making the search for good paying dividends that much harder. 
"
210,AFL,"But they're out there if you're committed to finding them. 
"
211,AFL,"Smaller growth companies will typically not pay a dividend as they will pour all their money into growing their business. 
"
212,AFL,"The larger companies with solid earnings, but without the aggressive growth rates that may have marked their earlier years, will often reward their investors by paying out a portion of their earnings in dividends.

"
216,AFL,"(In addition to a track record of solid earnings, it's important to have a successful future of solid growth as well, otherwise your dividend could be in jeopardy.

249,AFL,"The U.S. Federal Reserve will likely lift the benchmark interest rate this week, to stay a step ahead of inflation.Yesterday’s Labor Department report revealed that U.S. consumer prices in May had logged its biggest gain in the last six years.The U.S. economy is at its full employment level and a stretched workforce market will eventually push up inflation; as employers are trying to brave labor shortages with higher wages. A super-low jobless rate coupled with expectations for a stronger economy will likely tip the Fed’s hand to bring in four hikes this year instead of three.Against this backdrop, investors can bet on select banking, brokerage and insurance stocks to fetch alluring returns.Higher Inflation Stokes Rate Hike ProspectsThe Fed is likely to increase rates by 25 basis points (bps) in the 1.75-2% range, at the end of tomorrow’s two-day Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) policy meet. According to the CME Fed Watch Tool, the odds of a rate hike this time are as high as 96.3%.The minutes from FOMC’s last month’s meeting also reveal that intertest rate on surplus reserves will climb by 20 bps to push the federal funds rate.May’s Consumer Price Index climbed 2.8% year over year, marking its highest gain since February 2012. Core index improved 2.2% from the year-ago period, recording its biggest advance since February 2017. Consumer Inflation in April was pegged at 2.5%, well above the Fed’s 2% target.Beyond 2018, FOMC’s Personal Consumption Expenditures deflator forecasts are anticipated to remain near or slightly higher than 2%, steady with the 10-year U.S. breakeven inflation rates.Notably, overnight indexed swaps currently indicate a nearly 75 bps of rate hikes in the next 12 months to about 2.37%.Upbeat consumer sentiment is giving rise to inflation expectations. The University of Michigan consumer-sentiment index, currently pegged at 98.8 in May, is still at its long-time highs. On the other hand, inflation expectations for 2019 have moved up to 2.8% form 2.7%.Factors Pouring in American InflationThe jobs’ report for May mirrored a tightening labor market scenario in Trump land, with unemployment sinking to 3.8%, its lowest level since the dot-com roar of the early 2000. Also, a 2.7% year-over-year upswing in last month’s average hourly earnings wiped out fears of wage stagnation.However, the Fed will try to cool down such speedy job growth trajectory via added rate hikes, as increased employment and wage rates will continue to push up inflation higher than its favored gauge of 2%.   Additionally, higher oil prices, the December enacted tax overhaul, weakening U.S. currency and synchronous global growth, as well as brewing trade war tensions between America and its economic allies, might all escalate price pressures going forward.Likely Gainers from a Rate HikeBrokerage firms and asset managers will benefit from higher interest rates since a rise in rates generally coincides with periods of economic strength and investor enthusiasm.In addition, a rising-rate environment will be beneficial for bank stocks as banks widen the spread between what they earn by funding longer-term assets, such as loans, with shorter-term liabilities.Moreover, rise in rates will enable insurance firms to invest in higher-yielding government securities, thereby leading to greater returns.5 Hot PicksGiven such positives, we have highlighted five promising stocks that are poised to gain from the impending rate hike.These picks have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy) and a VGM Score of A or B.Kemper Corporation (KMPR  -  Free Report) offers life and health, and property and casualty insurances to   to businesses and individuals.

250,AFL,"The U.S.-Canada trade dispute escalated after U.S. President Donald Trump called Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau “very dishonest and weak.” Trump had accused Canada of “charging massive tariffs” to U.S. businesses.The tiff involved France and Germany who criticized Trump’s decision to back out of the G7 communique. Trump, in the meanwhile, threatened to double auto tariffs, marring the G7 efforts to show a united front.   With Trump refusing to endorse the G7 communique, stock market gains are likely to be capped. In fact, more uncertainty is lurking as Trump is set to meet North Korean President Kim Jong Un in Singapore. Amid such ambiguity, investing in dividend aristocrats seems prudent, as they provide higher total returns with lower volatility.No Breakthrough at G7 SummitTrump’s stinging attack on Canada jeopardized the G7’s efforts to maintain free and fair trade relationships. He specifically accused Canada of imposing a 270% tariff on dairy. This has forced many U.S. dairy products from making their way to Canada from the United States. Trump, in return, has decided to slap more import tariffs on the sensitive auto industry.Trump tweeted “PM Justin Trudeau of Canada acted so meek and mild during our @G7 meetings only to give a news conference after I left saying that, ‘US Tariffs were kind of insulting’ and he ‘will not be pushed around.’ Very dishonest & weak. Our tariffs are in response to his of 270% on dairy!”Meanwhile, Trudeau’s office added that the dairy tariffs were primarily a reaction to Trump’s decision to levy charges on steel and aluminum imports from Canada, Mexico and the EU. Moreover, protective measures like Canada’s dairy tariff are very common throughout the world. Lest we forget, the United States has imposed tariffs to protect several of its industries, starting from the 350% tariff on tobacco to 160% on shelled peanuts.Trudeau said that Germany stood by the “jointly agreed communique” despite Trump’s decision to back out. France and Europe also continued to support the G7 communique and stated that anyone quitting the summit will be showing their “incoherence and inconsistency.”Historic Trump-Kim Summit, Central Bank MeetingsAmid the G7 trade spat, investors are keeping an eye on the much-talked-about meet between Trump and Kim in Singapore. The stakes are high as the summit marks the first time when both the leaders will meet in person to reach a denuclearization agreement on the Korean Peninsula.But, investors shouldn’t get their hopes up. Even if the meeting is successful, the stock market should brace for more gyrations as this week awaits outcome from central bank meetings.Time to Buy Dividend AristocratsSuch uncertainties make dividend paying stocks more attractive as they tend to outperform when the broader markets are facing gyrations. But, why dividend aristocrats? This is because this set of stocks outperforms other dividend payers on better quality business.This category of stocks reflects solid financial structure and healthy underlying fundamentals.

260,AFL,"Nasdaq, Inc. (NDAQ  -  Free Report) is slated to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 25 before the market opens. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive surprise of 3.96%.Let’s see, how things are shaping up for this announcement.New client wins, solid backlog and favorable business trends are likely to have driven Market Services in the to-be-reported quarter. A considerable market share in U.S. options, U.S. equities, European equities and strong Trade Management services are expected to have added to this upside. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Market Services revenues is pegged at $160 million, a 15.9% increase from the year-ago period.Strategic acquisitions might have aided the top line.U.S. equity options volume expanded 23.1% year over year to 474 million contracts, European options and futures volumes were 22.3 million contracts in the first quarter, up 2.8% year over year.Also, non-transaction revenue base is likely to have improved, banking on the strength of market technology, listing and information revenues.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $644 million, up 10.5% year over year.Non-transaction revenues are expected to have increased, driven by market technology, listing as well as information revenues. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Market technology revenues stands at $79 million, up 17.9% year over year while the same for listing services revenues is projected at $70 million, up 7.7% year over year.A lower tax incidence, owing to tax reform implemented earlier this year, should provide an extra boost to the bottom line.However, revenues per contract for U.S. equity options declined by a penny to 15 cents, though the same for European options and futures increased 11.9% to 47 cents.What Our Quantitative Model SaysOur proven model shows that Nasdaq is likely to beat estimates this quarter.

261,AFL,"The U.S. stock market mostly see-saws during the pre-midterm election period and rallies once the uncertainty fades, say analysts at The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (GS  -  Free Report). The scenario is not expected to be any different this time around. Investors should brace for increased turbulence as a divided government is highly expected this election.The last several months, in fact, have seen extreme levels of volatility as investors remained concerned about more protectionist trade policies and spike in bond yields after prices of essential commodities continued to move north. Given such uncertainty, investing in stocks that provide excellent risk-adjusted returns seems judicious.Brace for Months of UncertaintyInvestors should brace for neck-snapping volatility as midterm election approaches, per Goldman. The broader market has been on a roller-coaster ride for the past few months, thanks to trade and tax polic, along with geopolitical tensions. Controversies surrounding Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s probe into whether Trump colluded with Russia’s initiative to impede the 2016 presidential election have aggravated concerns.Thus, corporate profits and economic reports might have been crucial factors for stocks but political developments have continued to determine the direction of the market.In the last 11 midterm election years since 1974, the S&P 500 managed to eke out gains in April, but, mostly traded flat through September only to rally once political uncertainty waned, per Goldman. In fact, in those years, stock market volatility averaged 15% compared with the median of 12% in all years.This year is likely to be the same. After all, Democrats are poised to regain control over the House of Representatives even though Republicans are expected to maintain an upper hand in the Senate, based on recent polls. Goldman forecasts that Democrats will have nearly a 70% chance of repossessing the House but there is less than 40% chance of regaining a majority in the Senate. Goldman added that such a divided government doesn’t bode well for investors.Volatility Makes a Dramatic ComebackVolatility has already seen several days with sharp moves so far this year. The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX), the so-called Wall Street’s fear index, has seen a jump of no less than 20% in at least six trading sessions this year, according to the WSJ Market Data Group.The volatility index has experienced 19 sessions so far this year where it ended up at least 5%, the highest since 1994. In fact, volatility doubled on Feb 5 as inflation concerns dragged the broader market down.Such earth-shattering volatility followed a relatively calm 2017.  Last year, the stock market shrugged off political and economic uncertainty, and demonstrated almost nothing in the way of market pullbacks.Bond Yields Spike, Equities WobbleSpike in U.S. bond yields, by the way, have triggered market gyrations. The benchmark 10-year Treasury note hit its highest level since January 2014 at 2.97% in early European trade. The 10-year yield increased as treasuries came under pressure. Treasuries sold off as higher commodity prices diminish the value of a bond’s fixed interest payments. Rise in oil prices and business houses saying that the cost of steel and several other raw materials are increasing in the United States have induced inflation fears.Rise in bond yields affected the buying appetite for stocks. Uptick in bond yields increased the opportunity cost of investing in equities and therefore equities became less alluring. Selling pressure on U.S. equity benchmarks intensified on Apr 20, with all three major bourses retracing into the negative territory.5 Top Stocks to Counter Market GyrationsGiven the aforesaid factors, it seems like Wall Street is poised to face months of volatility with midterms just around the corner. Taking this into consideration, investors should build a strategy on low-risk assets and a combination of parameters that lead to better returns. The best way to go about doing this is by creating a portfolio of low-beta stocks, which are inherently less volatile than the markets they trade in. In this case, a low beta ranges from 0 to 1.These stocks are also dividend payers which boast immense financial strength and are immune to market vagaries. Such stocks reflect solid financial structure, healthy underlying fundamentals and better quality business. Further, they boast a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).Aflac Incorporated (AFL  -  Free Report), through its subsidiary American Family Life Assurance Company of Columbus, provides voluntary supplemental health and life insurance products.

After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for AFL in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at 99 cents per share for AFL, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of 97 cents per share.

263,AFL,"Aflac Inc. (AFL  -  Free Report) is scheduled to announce first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 25, after the closing bell. Its quarterly revenues and earnings are expected to improve year over year.The company is expected to benefit from a healthy sales pipeline in its U.S. segment, share buyback partly offset by an expected sales decline in it Japan business and branch conversion cost.Last quarter, Aflac’s earnings surpassed estimates by 3.2% led by strong contribution from its U.S. segment. This is depicted in the chart below:Earnings Surprise HistoryThe company boasts an attractive earnings surprise history, having surpassed estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 5.88%.Aflac Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise Aflac Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise | Aflac Incorporated QuoteWhy a Likely Positive Surprise? Our proven model indicates that chances of Aflac beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate are high as it has the right combination of the two key ingredients — positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Aflac is +1.73%.Zacks Rank: Aflac has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which increases the predictive power of ESP.Factors Affecting Q1 ResultsAflac’s first-quarter results are expected to benefit from increased sales from its U.S. segment. This unit has been performing strongly as evident by increasing revenues since 2010, a trend that continued in 2017. We expect to see strong financial performance and continued strength in the profitability of Aflac U.S. led by the ongoing investment in this business, such as the adoption of Everwell for increased penetration, delivery of value-added services and increased client retention; product partnering to drive improved account values and employee access; and investment in administrative capabilities, should drive overall growth.We expect to see new sales increase in the first quarter driven by overall growth of broker distribution and improved growth in the company’s career sales distribution. Broker distribution is expected to drive sales in the mid-case market, an area of focus for the company in 2018. The career sales distribution should drive sales in the small case market.Aflac’s top line remains sufficiently exposed to a challenging operating environment, primarily in Japan. The persistent low interest rate environment has led the company to deemphasize sales of first-sector (life insurance) products in Japan and emphasize sale of third sector products. However, third sector sales is expected to be down in the first half of the year and especially in the first quarter, due to the introduction of one refreshed core medical product in the first quarter of 2017, driving sales increase.Moreover, sales in the Japan segment will also be under pressure, as the company delayed product introduction until the second quarter, due to Japan branch deconversion to a subsidiary. Per management, third sector sales could be down in the high single digits in the first quarter of the year.However, the company’s continued efforts to return capital to its shareholders via share buyback will cushion its bottom line.The company should incur part of Japan branch conversion costs in the first quarter. Management expects the same to come in at the lower end of its cost expectation of $120 million to $130 million. While $42 million has already been incurred in 2017, the rest of the cost is expected to be incurred in the first half of 2018.Other Stocks Worth ConsideringHere are some companies worth considering as our model shows that these possess the right combination of elements to beat estimates this quarter:  American Equity Investment Life Holding Company (AEL  -  Free Report) will likely report first-quarter 2018 earnings results on May 2.

Global Network Services billed business should grow at a slower rate over the year than the proprietary business as a result of the impact of the evolving regulatory environment in Europe and Australia. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for card billed business is $275 billion, up 9.1% year over year.Per a William Blair analyst, American Express is seeing strong Business to Business billings growth, which is poised to accelerate further given the massive underpenetrated market and its unique service offerings generated from its data analytics capabilities, relationship network across the supply chain, and integrated payments platform.Increase in Loan and Recievables:  Card Member loan and receivables growth should be seen as the company continues to expand its relationships with existing customers and acquires new Card Members. This should have, however, led to an increase in provisions for losses, lending delinquencies and net write-off rates. The increases in the delinquencies and net write-off rates were primarily due to the seasoning of recent loan vintages and a shift in mix over time toward non-cobrand lending products, which have higher write-off rates but also drive higher net interest yields.Earnings Surprise HistoryThe company boasts an impressive earnings surprise history. It beat estimates in each of the four reported quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 2.5%.American Express Company Price and EPS Surprise  American Express Company Price and EPS Surprise | American Express Company QuoteZacks Rank and Other StocksAmerican Express carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

265,AFL,"Similar to wise buying decisions, exiting certain underperformers at the right time helps maximize portfolio returns. Selling off losers can be difficult, but if both the share price and estimates are falling, it could be time to get rid of the security before more losses hit your portfolio. One such stock that you may want to consider dropping is Amerisafe, Inc. (AMSF  -  Free Report), which has witnessed a significant price decline in the past four weeks, and it has seen negative earnings estimate revisions for the current quarter and the current year. A Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) further confirms weakness in AMSF. A key reason for this move has been the negative trend in earnings estimate revisions. For the full year, we have seen two estimates moving down in the past 30 days, compared with just no upward revisions. This trend has caused the consensus estimate to trend lower, going from $3.55 a share a month ago to its current level of $3.22.Also, for the current quarter, Amerisafe has seen two downward estimate revisions versus no revisions in the opposite direction, dragging the consensus estimate down to 73 cents a share from 88 cents over the past 30 days.   The stock also has seen some pretty dismal trading lately, as the share price has dropped 9.4% in the past month.AMERISAFE, Inc.

266,AFL,"Aflac Inc. (AFL  -  Free Report) is in a favorable position given its improving operating backdrop, rising rate environment, expected benefit from the recently implemented tax bill and strong domestic economy.It’s a good idea to add stocks with robust fundamentals and long-term growth opportunities to your portfolio at the current level. Aflac is one such stock that has been witnessing upward estimate revisions, which reflects analysts’ optimism about its future prospects. Over the last 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 and 2018 rose 5.2% and 2.2%, respectively.Further, shares of this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company have gained around 27% in a year’s time, outperforming the industry’s 20.6% rally.5 Reasons Why Aflac Looks Attractive   Strong 2018 Guidance: Following impressive earnings in 2017, the company provided a strong outlook for 2018. It projects earnings per share between $7.45 and $7.75, the mid-point of which translates into year-over-year growth of 11.6%.A favorable guidance against persistent challenges in its Japan business raises investors’ confidence.Earnings Strength: Aflac witnessed earnings per share growth  in 2017 and 2016, despite facing weakness in its Japan business and stiff competition. The ongoing deconversion of the company’s Japan subsidiary, strong U.S. business and disciplined capital management should buoy earnings in the coming quarters.Strong US Segment: Aflac U.S. continues to perform favorably, evident from revenue increase since 2010 (CAGR of 3.1% from 2010-2016) which continued through 2017 (total revenues rose 2%). The company has undertaken a number of growth initiatives in this segment which will drive top line growth. In 2018, it expectsnew annualized premium growth in the range of 3% to 5%, resulting in 2% to 3% growth in earned premium.Tax Reform Impact: Aflac will invest $250 million in different areas such as employee welfare and business growth as well as provide support for childhood cancer initiatives. This development follows the recent passage of the tax reform by Donald Trump, which cuts the corporate tax rate to 21% from 35%. Per management, this easy tax regime provides an opportunity to make investments that will further drive business growth.Strong Capital Position: Aflac has strong risk-adjusted capital at its operating subsidiaries supported by consistent earnings and good liquidity. The company has an impressive capital management strategy in place. It has been increasing dividend for the past 36 years. The company expects to repurchase shares in the range of $1.1 million to $1.4 billion and deploy approximately $2.1 billion to $2.4 billion of capital in 2018. Leverage ratio of 17.7% as of Dec 31, 2017, is below the lower end of its target range of 20-25%.Other Stocks to ConsiderKemper Corp. (KMPR  -  Free Report), sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), has been witnessing upward estimate revisions for the past 30 days. Also, the company has surpassed estimates in each of the four quarters with an average positive surprise of 121.2%.

(FFG  -  Free Report) has been witnessing upward estimate revisions for the last 60 days. The company beat earnings estimates in two of the four quarters with an average positive surprise of 1.54%. It carries a Zacks Rank of 2.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

267,AFL,"Amerisafe Inc. (AMSF  -  Free Report) reported fourth-quarter 2017 operating earnings per share of 69 cents, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 16.9%. Also, earnings slumped 33.7% year over year due to a decline in revenues.Quarter in DetailAmerisafe’s total operating revenues decreased 3.7% from the prior-year quarter to $94.9 million, but surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.3%.Gross written premiums in the quarter were up 0.6% to $81.1 million, primarily due to increase in payroll audits and related premium adjustments, partly offset by declines in voluntary premiums.AMERISAFE, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise AMERISAFE, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | AMERISAFE, Inc. QuoteNet investment income decreased 6.9% year over year to $7.3 million. This was mainly due to increase in the value of an investment in a limited partnership hedge fund in the year-ago quarter.Total expenses came in at $77.14 million, up 9% from the year-ago quarter led by higher loss and loss adjustments incurred, and underwriting and other operating costs.Net combined ratio, a measure of profitability (lower the better) was 88.3%, deteriorating 1150 basis points (bps) year over year.The company incurred a one-time non-cash charge of $12.6 million in the fourth quarter, on account of estimated impact of revaluation of its net deferred tax assets pursuant to the Tax Reform Act enacted in December.Financial UpdateAmerisafe exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $55.56 million, down 5.7% year over year.As of Dec 31, 2017, total shareholders’ equity was $425.4 million, down 6.7% from the year-ago quarter.Operating return on equity was 11.4%, down 530 bps year over year.Book value per share as of Dec 31, 2017 was $22.10, down 6.8% from the prior-year quarter.Dividend Hike, Share Repurchase NilOn Feb 22, 2018, the company increased its regular quarterly dividend by 10% to 22 cents per share.  This increased dividend will be payable on Mar 23, 2018 to shareholders of record as of Mar 9, 2018.During the quarter, no shares were repurchased under the company’s share repurchase plan.Our TakeAmerisafe’s results reflect continued suffering from softness in workers compensation market, which has been pressurizing revenues since the past three years. Increase in expenses is a drag on margins. However, its efficient claims management, favorable loss and frequency trends, prudent reserve analytics and improved operating leverage should be fruitful for the company.Zacks RankAmerisafe carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

269,AFL,"Historic volatility has shaken the stock market badly and pushed it to correction territory last week, with investors fearing the end of cheap money policy era due to higher inflation, faster growth and rising budget deficits. This has raised the appeal of value investing (read: Best and Worst ETFs of Last Week).This is especially true as value stocks have strong fundamentals — earnings, dividends, book value and cash flow — that trade below their intrinsic value and are undervalued by the market. Value stocks often overreact to both positive and negative news, resulting in share price movement that does not reflect the company’s true long-term fundamentals. This creates buying opportunities in such stocks at depressed prices and shows the potential for capital appreciation when the stock finally reflects its true market price.As a result, value stocks have the potential to deliver higher returns and exhibit lower volatility compared with growth and blend counterparts. In fact, these stocks outperform the growth ones across all asset classes when considered on a long-term investment horizon. Also, value stocks are less susceptible to trending markets.The long-term fundamentals for the stocks have been bullish given accelerating global economic growth, strong corporate earnings and the euphoria surrounding the new tax legislation. Additionally, growth in the U.S. economy has been solid, buoyed by an impressive labor market, higher wages, increasing consumer spending and high consumer confidence.In particular, the biggest tax overhaul in decades is expected to provide a huge boost to the value stocks. This is because massive tax cuts will create an economic surge, boosting job growth in manufacturing and other sectors, increasing inflation and interest rates. Additionally, it would lead to higher earnings, increased buyback activities, and fatty dividends, prompting investors to rotate out of growth and into value stocks (read: Volatility ETF Crash: Important Takeaways).Given this, investors may want to consider a nice value play in the current erratic market. For them, we have presented five ETFs and stocks that will likely outperform in the coming weeks if volatility prevails.ETF PicksUsing our database, we have selected popular value ETFs that provide exposure to the broad stock market instead of a particular sector and have a Zacks ETF Rank #3 (Hold) with an expense ratio of below 0.50%.

The upside was backed by solid performance of its U.S. segment.Net earnings were $5.95 in the fourth quarter compared with $1.84 in the year-ago quarter.

The figure not only beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.76 but also improved 4.8% year over year, excluding the negative impact of 10 cents per share from a weaker yen.Total revenues for the fourth quarter declined 10% year over year to $5.4 billion and missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.3%.For 2017, total revenues came at $21.7 billion, down 4% year over year.Quarterly Segments ResultsAflac JapanTotal revenues declined 5.9% year over year to $3.7 billion. Pretax operating earnings increased 5.1% to $747 million.Premium income, net of reinsurance agreements, decreased 6.7% year over year to $3.1 billion. The downside happened as growth in third sector premium was more than offset by an expected reduction in first sector premium.Net investment income, net of amortized hedge costs, decreased 1.1% to $559 million due to the foreign currency impact of U.S. dollar-denominated investments.Growth rate in Japan for the fourth quarter was suppressed due to a weaker yen/dollar exchange rate.Aflac U.S.Total revenues increased 2.1% year over year to $1.6 billion.The company’s U.S. segment reported a 2.2% year-over-year increase in premium income to $1.4 billion.

This reflects Aflac's stable sales and high persistency in Japan.Coming to its U.S. segment, in the year, Aflac anticipates growth in earned premium to lie within 2% to 3% and new annualized premium sales growth to range within 3% to 5%.The company expects to buy back shares worth $1.1-$1.4 billion in 2018.Aflac also expects to increase overall investment in the U.S. segment by nearly $250 million over three to five years.Our TakeAflac’s fourth-quarter earnings reflect strength in its U.S. operations. Company-wide agent distribution, new product launch and ongoing investments in the U.S. operations segment are also expected to propel further growth.However, although the company’s operation in Japan is exposed to foreign exchange fluctuations, its stable sales and persistency in the segment raise optimism.Zacks Rank Aflac has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

As of Jan 26, 26% S&P 500 companies reported results with strong earnings numbers and 24% of them are slated to release this week.Per the latest Earnings Preview, total earnings for the 133 S&P 500 members that have reported results already are up 12.3% year over year on 8.8% higher revenues, with 81.2% beating EPS estimates and 78.9% topping revenue estimates. About 65.4% of the companies have surpassed both EPS and revenue estimates.Industry TrendsInsurance industry, an integral part of the Finance sector, will witness soft performance in the to-be-reported quarter which will drag the sector’s fourth-quarter results. Per the Earnings Preview, earnings of the Finance sector will improve 8.4% with revenues increasing 2.4% year over year.A slew of natural calamities inducing cat loss dented the underwriting profitability of insurers this year. The fourth quarter is likely to suffer due to the California wildfires. As a result, insurers have hiked prices that remained flat due to a not-so-active catastrophe environment. With higher prices, insurers not only will enjoy higher premiums going forward but also be well-equipped to settle claims without hurting profitability.In addition, since December 2016, four rate hikes have been made and the interest rate now stands at 1.25-1.50%. Also, the Fed has reiterated the expectation to raise rates thrice in 2018 and twice in 2019. Owing to a gradually improving rate environment, investment results have improved moderately from the historical lows.Moreover, the tax reform policy, enacted in December 2017, that lowers the corporate tax burden to 20% from 35%, is likely act as an impetus, aiding margin expansion. However, due to reduction in tax rates, insurers are writing down deferred tax assets that in turn will adversely impact their risk-based capitalization levels and also reduce net income for some players in the fourth quarter.Stocks to ConsiderFirst, Aflac Inc.’s (AFL  -  Free Report) fourth-quarter results are expected to benefit from increased revenues from its U.S. segment that has been performing strongly as evident from rise in revenues since 2010.Also, we expect sales increase to continue in the fourth quarter given the number of growth initiatives such as the adoption of Everwell for increased penetration, delivery of value-added services and increased client retention; product partnering to drive improved account values and employee access; and investment in administrative capabilities. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from this segment is $1.6 billion, which translates into year-over-year growth of 6.7%.Aflac’s top line remains sufficiently exposed to a challenging operating environment, primarily in Japan. The persistent low interest rate environment has led the company to deemphasize sales of first-sector (life insurance) products in Japan. Premium growth continues to be pressured by first-sector savings product, WAYS, and a portion of block reaching paid-up status.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Aflac is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. Aflac has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.However, the company has an Earnings ESP of -0.49%. Despite carrying a favorable Zacks Rank, a negative earnings ESP makes the prediction difficult.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for income from operation for the Annuity segment is $264 million, which reflects year-over-year growth of 9.1%.Lincoln National’s life insurance business is expected to see top-line growth from a broad product portfolio and an industry-leading distribution network. The company’s Group Protection segment that was challenged in the recent past is now recovering. The fourth quarter is likely to be aided by this segment’s performance as well.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Lincoln National is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because despite carrying a favorable Zacks Rank #2, an Earnings ESP of 0.00% makes the positive earnings surprise prediction inconclusive.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.08, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 8%.Moreover, the company has likely experienced premium growth at both Unum U.S. and Colonial Life segments, driven by improving sales and persistency.However, the results of Unum U.K. are expected to have remained soft, due to a challenging economic environment.Our proven model shows that Unum Group has the right combination of the two key ingredients to beat earnings estimates.

274,AFL,"Shares of Aflac Inc. (AFL  -  Free Report) scaled a 52-week high of $91.3 on Jan 9, eventually closing a tad lower at $90. The gain is believed to be driven by the positive impact of the recently signed tax reform.What Aided the Price RiseThe company recently announced that it will invest $250 million in different areas such as employee welfare, business growth and provide support to childhood cancer initiatives.This development follows the recent passage of the tax reform by Donald Trump, which cuts the corporate tax rate to 21% from 35%. Per management, this easy tax regime provides it an opportunity to make investments like the latest one.Moreover, for its U.S workforce, Aflac intends to make better retirement benefits by increasing the company's 401(k) match from 50% to 100% on the first 4% of employee’s contribution while making a one-time contribution of $500 to every employee's 401(k) plan. It will also offer certain hospital and accident insurance products to all employees free of charge as the company currently does with its core cancer insurance products.On the business growth front, the company plans to invest in the technology and digital businesses like Empowered — a subsidiary of Aflac.Share Price PerformanceAflac’s stock has gained 29.6% in a year’s time, outperforming its industry’s growth of 21.5%.Is Further Upside Left?This Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) stock continues to suffer from:Conversion Costs: Aflac is in the process of converting its Japan branch into a subsidiary. This, in turn, will enhance its business development flexibility. In fact, the  company has booked approximately $24 million in pretax costs associated with its Japan branch conversion in the first nine months of 2017.The conversion remains on track and the company expects to incur conversion costs of $120 million to $130 million pretax through mid-2018. These costs will hurt the company’s margins in the coming quarters.Pressure on Business in Japan: Aflac’s top line remains sufficiently exposed to a challenging operating environment, primarily in Japan, which contributes nearly 70% of the company’s revenues. The persistent low interest rate environment has led the company to deemphasize sales of first-sector (life insurance) products in the region.The curtailment of these products as well as weakening of yen has led to a decline in revenues by 0.3% in 2016 and 5.7% in the first nine months of 2017. Going forward, the restriction on sale of first-sector products, which carry higher premiums along with currency volatility are further expected to suppress top-line growth in the region.  Forex Volatility: The company’s significant exposure to Japan makes its vulnerable to foreign currency volatility. Evidently, Aflac’s earnings have been hampered by the alarming weakening of the Japanese yen relative to the U.S. dollar for the past many years.While foreign currency adversely impacted bottom line by 34 cents in 2016, the weaker yen/dollar exchange rate hurt operating earnings per diluted share by 8 cents in the first nine months of 2017. Currency volatility is expected to continue affecting earnings in the coming quarters.Overvalued: Aflac's valuation looks stretched at the current level. The company currently has a trailing 12-month price-to-book (P/B) ratio of 1.6, near its highest range. The ratio is also higher than the P/B ratio of 1.4 for the industry.Based on the above-mentioned factors, we believe the stock will remain under pressure in the near term.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked players in the space are Amerisafe, Inc. (AMSF  -  Free Report), Trupanion, Inc. (TRUP  -  Free Report) and Unum Group (UNM  -  Free Report) carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Amerisafe’s beat estimates in two of the four quarters with an average positive surprise of 1.4%.Trupanion beat estimates in three of the last four quarters with an average positive surprise of 38.8%.Unum beat estimates in each of the last four quarters with an average positive surprise of 3.2%.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

275,AFL,"Aflac Inc. (AFL  -  Free Report) has announced that it will invest $250 million in different areas such as employee welfare, business growth and provide support to childhood cancer initiatives.This development follows the recent passage of the tax reform by Donald Trump, which cuts the corporate tax rate to 21% from 35%. Per management, this easy tax regime provides it an opportunity to make investments like the latest one.Moreover, for its U.S workforce Aflac intends to make better retirement benefits by increasing the company's 401(k) match from 50% to 100% on the first 4% of employee’s contribution while making a one-time contribution of $500 to every employee's 401(k) plan. It will also offer certain hospital and accident insurance products to all employees free of charge as the company currently does with its core cancer insurance products.On the business growth front, the company would invest in technology and digital businesses like Empowered — a subsidiary of Aflac.The third leg of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s investment will be to focus on its commitment for childhood cancer programs.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) Rank stocks here.Year to date, Aflac has gained 27% outperforming the industry’s growth of 25%.Notably, the U.S. Senate’s passage of The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act marked President Trump’s first major legislative victory. This tax reform is anticipated to drive companies’ revenues. According to Trump, such a bill is a “big, beautiful Christmas present” for families while the White House press secretary declared it to be “a simple, fair, and competitive tax code [that] will be rocket fuel for our economy, and it's within our reach.”In fact, this is the biggest ever one-time drop in business tax that is likely to be conducive to economic growth.However, this reform brings a mixed impact for insurers. RenaissanceRe Holdings Ltd. (RNR  -  Free Report) announced an anticipated write-down of its deferred tax assets (DTA), which will reduce its net income by $40 million following the enactment of the tax bill. Otherwise, RenaissanceRe expects the economic impact of the Tax Bill to be minimal.Nevertheless, a 21% corporate tax rate will lead to higher after-tax income for most insurers. Apart from boosting margins, the tax-rate reduction will also make the U.S insurers more competitive, globally.In addition to the above, the tax reform, which includes lower domestic tax rates on repatriation of income stashed offshore will serve the foreign insurers well, who moved abroad the profit generated in the U.S to avoid tax.Markedly, the bill looks like a major legislative achievement having been supported widely by industry groups. The Coalition for American Insurance, which represents major US-based insurance groups like — Alleghany, The Allstate Corp. (ALL  -  Free Report), American Family, American Financial Group Inc. (AFG  -  Free Report), Berkshire Hathaway, Cincinnati Insurance, CAN, EMC Insurance, Liberty Mutual, The Hartford, Travelers and W.R. Berkley Corp. — have expressed support for this historical reform as well.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

276,AFL,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Aflac Incorporated (AFL  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Aflac has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 12.9, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 21.4. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, Aflac’s current PE level puts it above its midpoint over the past five years, with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with its industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 13.4. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is a bit undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that Aflac has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 12.9, which is in line with the current level. Hence the forward earnings estimates are already incorporated in the company’s current share price.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Aflac has a P/S ratio of about 1.6. This is significantly lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.4 right now.If anything, this suggests some level of undervalued trading—at least compared to historical norms.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Aflac currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of A, putting it into the top 20% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes Aflac a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.What About the Stock Overall?Though Aflac might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of F and a Momentum score of B. This gives AFL a Zacks VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of C. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been mixed. The current quarter has seen two estimates going higher in the past sixty days compared to three lower, while the full year estimate has seen five up and none down in the same time period.Therefore, the current quarter consensus estimate has remained stable in the past two months, while the full year estimate has inched up only by 1.2%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Aflac Incorporated Price and Consensus Aflac Incorporated Price and Consensus | Aflac Incorporated QuoteThis mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and why we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineAflac is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Moreover, a strong industry rank (Top 4% out of more than 250 industries) further supports the growth potential of the stock. In fact, over the past six months, its industry has clearly outperformed the broader market, as you can see below: However, with a Zacks Rank #3 it’s hard to get too excited about the stock overall, so value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

277,AFL,"The insurance industry has performed well this reporting cycle with robust earnings from key players. Even damages from successive hurricanes Harvey and Irma have not taken the sheen away from the industry as predicted earlier (read: Insurance ETFs Back On Track Post Hurricane Irma).Prominent players such as MetLife (MET  -  Free Report), Prudential Financial (PRU  -  Free Report), Chubb Corp (CB  -  Free Report), Allstate (ALL  -  Free Report) and Travelers (TRV  -  Free Report) surpassed both our earnings and revenue estimates. While American International (AIG  -  Free Report) missed the earnings estimate, Aflac Inc. (AFL  -  Free Report) lagged revenue estimates.Insurance Earnings in FocusMetLife, the U.S. life insurer behemoth, reported robust earnings of $1.09 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 19 cents but declined 11% from the year-ago quarter. Revenues increased 5% year over year to $16.8 billion and were well ahead of the estimate of $15 billion. PRU, the second-largest U.S. life insurer, also beat the earnings estimate by 30 cents. Earnings improved 13.2% year over year. Revenues increased 10.2% year over year to $13.4 billion edging past the $12.24 billion estimate.One of the leading property and casualty insurers, Chubb, reported loss of 13 cents per share, narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 26 cents and deteriorated from earnings of $2.88 in the year-ago quarter.

On a year-over-year basis, earnings and revenues grew 27% and 4.8%, respectively.AIG, one of the largest commercial insurers in the United States and Canada, came up with a huge earnings miss of 47%.

Revenues also fell 3.5% year over year to $5.51 billion and fell short of the $5.55 billion estimate (see: all the Financial ETFs here).Personal property and casualty insurer Travelers posted earnings per share of 91 cents, easily crushing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 53 cents but declining 62.1% year over year. Revenues grew 5.2% year over year to $7.2 billion and were ahead of the estimated $7.0 billion.ETFs in FocusGiven the robust Q3 results, insurance ETFs SPDR S&P Insurance ETF (KIE  -  Free Report) and iShares U.S. Insurance ETF (IAK  -  Free Report) have been leading the way in the past 10 days. This is especially true as KIE has shed 0.4% and IAK has gained 0.1% compared with a loss of 1.8% for the broad financial ETF (XLF  -  Free Report).

278,AFL,"American International Group Inc. (AIG  -  Free Report) reported third-quarter 2017 operating loss of $1.22 per share, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 47%. In the year-ago quarter, the company had reported earnings of $1.01 per share.The underperformance stemmed from a $3.0 billion impact from unprecedented catastrophic events like hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria. This matched the company’s previously disclosed preliminary loss estimates.Also perturbing was a disclosure by the company that it added $836 million to prior accident year loss reserves.The company is getting along well with its expense reduction program (taken up in Jan 2016 to reduce cost base by $1.4 billion by the end of 2017) as evident by a 15.3% decline in general operating and other expenses (GOE) to $2.1 billion.American International Group, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise American International Group, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | American International Group, Inc. QuoteQuarterly Segment HighlightsCommercial Insurance Suffers From Loss ClaimsNet premiums written were down 13% year over year (both on a reported and a constant dollar basis) to $3.8 billion due to strategic portfolio actions and divestitures.Combined ratio of 195.4% deteriorated a massive 8960 basis points year over year, primarily due to an increase in loss ratio, which was due to huge catastrophe losses. This also caused pre-tax operating loss of $2.86 billion in contrast with an operating income of $685 million in the year-ago quarter.Uninspiring Consumer Insurance ResultsPremium and fees of $3.88 billion remained unchanged year over year.Pre-tax operating earnings decreased 18% year over year to $1 billion due to a decline in contribution from Individual Retirement and loss from Personal Insurance sub-segments.The segment’s combined ratio of 105.6% deteriorated 810 points year over year.Financial PositionAt the end of the third quarter, the insurer’s adjusted book value per share (excluding AOCI) was $57.44, down 6.5% year over year.Core adjusted return on equity (ROE) was negative 11.6% compared with 9% in the year-ago quarter.In the third quarter, AIG spent $275 million on share repurchase.Business UpdateIn September, the decision by Financial Stability Oversight Council stripped off the nonbank Systemically Important Financial Institution designation on AIG.On Nov 1, 2017, AIG closed the sale of its remaining life settlements’ portfolio, which will result in the remittance of $1.1 billion of cash proceeds to AIG Parent in fourth-quarter 2017 and fulfill the $9 billion return of Legacy capital.Turn Around Might Take Some More TimeAIG’s results reflect the wrath of Mother Nature. The company has been suffering from tough markets conditions and its massive size, with numerous uncorrelated businesses creating little or no synergy. A number of asset sale and business divestitures made over the last many years have however streamlined the company to some extent.Last quarter, the insurance giant appointed Brian Duperreault as it new CEO, with expectations of improving operations, by completing restructuring initiatives already underway and making further changes.Nevertheless its underperforming commercial lines business, and exposure to catastrophe continue to bother. We believe it will take a while for the efforts to show actual results.Zacks Rank and Other PlayersAIG carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Hold).  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Among the other players in the same space, the bottom line at MetLife Inc.

Pretax operating earnings decreased 9.6% to $748 million.At its Japan segment, premium income, net of reinsurance agreements, decreased 3.5% year over year to $3.1 billion ( yen 355.3 billion) as savings products reached premium paid-up status in the quarter. Net investment income, net of amortized hedge costs, increased 1.1% to $0.6 million (yen 62.5 billion) due to the foreign currency impact of U.S. dollar-denominated investments.Growth rates in Japan for the third quarter were suppressed as a result of a weaker yen/dollar exchange rate.Aflac U.S.Total revenues increased 2.1% year over year to $1.6 billion.The company’s U.S. segment reported a 2.1% year-over-year increase in premium income to $1.4 billion.

Company-wide agent distribution, new product launch and ongoing investments in the U.S. operations segment will propel further growth.However, the company’s operation in Japan is exposed to foreign exchange fluctuations that continue to raise concerns.Zacks Rank and Other ReleasesAflac carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

280,AFL,"Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. (MMC  -  Free Report) third-quarter results, scheduled for Oct 26, are expected to benefit from increased revenues at both its operating segments, namely Risk and Insurance Services and Consulting.Revenues in the company’s Risk and Insurance Services segment, which contributes nearly 55% to total revenues, have been growing for the past several quarters and we expect the trend to continue in the quarter. Top-line growth will be aided by an increase in underlying revenues along with accretion from numerous acquisitions made during the course of the past many years. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues for the segment is $1.7 billion, up 6.3% year over year.Also, higher contribution is expected from Consulting. A combination of organic and inorganic growth measures are likely to drive revenues in this segment. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues for the segment is $1.6 billion, up 5.8% year over year.The company is expanding in underpenetrated regions such as Latin America, Asia, the Middle East and South Africa, which are perceived as high growth areas. Performance from these regions is likely to aid overall results.Along with pushing into attractive geographical regions, the company is expanding in new businesses which should drive revenues.

281,AFL,"The third-quarter earnings season is gaining pace with 17.4% members of the elite S&P 500 Index having reported solid numbers so far. The proportion of positive surprises is above average this quarter. Also, the estimate revision trend for the next quarter has been mostly favorable as Q4 estimates have gone up in the past couple of weeks.As of Oct 20, 2017, 87 S&P 500 members, accounting for 24.7% of the index’s total market capitalization, reported results, according to the latest Earnings Preview.Total earnings of these were up 9.4% from the year-ago quarter on a 7.3% improvement in revenues. The beat ratio was 71.3% for earnings and 70.1% for revenues.Per the report, total earnings of S&P 500 companies for Q3 are expected to grow 2.6% year over year on 5% higher revenues.Insurance industry, an integral part of the Finance sector (one of the 16 Zacks sectors), will witness soft results in the third quarter. Soft performance from the insurance industry will be a drag on the Finance sector. Per our report, earnings of the Finance sector will decline 1.5% though revenues will increase 1.1%.The third quarter witnessed a slew of catastrophes, which will weigh on underwriting profitability as well as the bottom line of insurers. Nevertheless, an aging population and growing unemployment are likely to drive demand for insurance products.Prudent underwriting practices and capital reserve piled up on a benign catastrophe environment in recent years will likely provide strong support to overall earnings.Also, higher rates should offer some respite to life insurers, which suffered spread compression on products like fixed annuities and universal life due to continued low rates. Annuity sales should have also benefited from higher rates. However, life insurers have considerably lowered their exposure to interest-sensitive product lines.With more than 700 companies (180 S&P 500 members) set to report their results this week, let’s find out where the following insurers stand before their release of quarterly numbers on Oct 25.Unum Group (UNM  -  Free Report) is expected to witness improved operating income at Unum U.S. and Colonial Life segments, driven by higher premiums and favorable risk results. Sales at both the segments will likely improve, thus fueling the company’s total premiums.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $1.04 per share on $2.8 billion revenues. While the bottom line reflects a 4.9% increase, the top line translates into a 2.3% increase, both on a year-over-year basis.Unum Group currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).However, its Earnings ESP of -0.51% makes surprise prediction difficult.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from this segment is $1.6 billion, which translates into year-over-year growth of 6.7%.Aflac’s top line remains sufficiently exposed to a challenging operating environment, primarily in Japan.

282,AFL,"Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and Aflac Incorporated (AFL  -  Free Report) may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Aflac is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for AFL in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $1.65 per share for AFL, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.62 per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for AFL, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +1.31% heading into earnings season.Aflac Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise Aflac Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise | Aflac Incorporated QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10-year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here).Given that AFL has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings.

283,AFL,"Aflac Inc.’s (AFL  -  Free Report) third-quarter results, scheduled for Oct 25, are expected to benefit from increased revenues from its U.S. segment. This unit has been performing strongly as evident by increasing revenues since 2010 for the past many years, a trend that continued through the first half of 2017.We expect the same to continue in the third quarter given a number of growth initiatives in this segment such as the adoption of Everwell for increased penetration, delivery of value-added services and increased client retention; product partnering to drive improved account values and employee access; and investment in administrative capabilities. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from this segment is $1.6 billion, which translates into year-over-year growth of 6.7%.Aflac’s top line remains sufficiently exposed to a challenging operating environment, primarily in Japan. The persistent low interest rate environment has led the company to deemphasize sales of first-sector (life insurance) products in Japan.The curtailment of these products has led to a decline in revenues by 0.3% in 2016 and 3% in first-half 2017.  The restriction on sale of first-sector products, which carry higher premiums, is further expected to suppress top-line growth in the region in the third quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from this segment is pegged at $3.8 billion, which signifies a decline of 7.9% year over year.The company is in the process of converting its Japan branch into a subsidiary. The conversion will enhance Aflac's business development flexibility. The company booked approximately $14 million in pretax costs associated with its Japan branch conversion in the first half of 2017. The conversion remains on track and the company expects to incur conversion costs of $120 million to $130 million pretax through mid-2018. These costs will hurt the company’s margins in the coming quarters.Aflac derives almost 70% of total revenues from Japan, which exposes it to significant foreign currency volatility, which may hurt its margins.However, the company’s continued efforts to return capital to its shareholders via share buyback will cushion its bottom line.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:Our proven model shows that Aflac has the right combination of the two key ingredients to beat earnings estimates.Zacks ESP:  Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is +1.31%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate of $1.65 is pegged higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.62.The positive ESP is a meaningful indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise.

284,AFL,"Discover Financial Services (DFS  -  Free Report) will release third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 24, after market close.The company is one of the major credit card issuers in the United States. It is creating an active card member base than solely relying on fund transfers at acquisitions, thus protecting the loan portfolio during times of lower balance transfers. Its Direct Banking business is a major revenue growth driver. Continuous growth in card sales and loans strengthen this segment. The company has been witnessing solid increase in card sales volume over past many years, benefitting its revenue base. The Zacks Consensus Estimates for total credit card volume and card sales are pegged at $35 billion and $32 billion, respectively, each reflecting year-over-year growth of 4%.However, the company’s Payments Service segment has been a drag over the past few years. Three pillars of this segment, Discover Network, Diners’ Club and Pulse Network has been continuously underperforming over past many years. This segment is likely to affect Discover Financial’s results in the third quarter as well. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its total transaction volume is pegged at $46.8 billion, reflecting a sequential decline of 6.6%.The company has been taking steps to manage its debt level. The third-quarter margin is hence expected to be less drained by the cost of borrowings. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Risk-based Capital ratio is pegged at 0.14 compared with 15.20 in the last quarter.Other FactorsDiscover Financial’s solid loan growth is also expected to be another contributor to top-line appreciation.The company’s frequently undertaken share repurchase programs, aimed at enhancing shareholders’ value, is expected to impact the bottom line positively by reducing the outstanding share count.Nevertheless, Discover Financial’s extensively undertaken promotional activities are likely to cause an increase in total expenses, thus impacting the bottom line.In addition, rising level of debt is likely to result in an increase in interest expenses in the third quarter, limiting the margin.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Discover Financial is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Discover Financial has an Earnings ESP of -0.29%.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at $5.3 billion, reflecting 30% year-over-year growth.However, the uptrend in total interest and fees on loans is expected to continue in the third quarter as well, driven primarily by the Retail Card platform. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total interest and fees on loans is pegged at $4.1 billion, reflecting 8.7% growth from the prior-year period.As the company continues to generate positive operating leverage that is favorably impacting the efficiency ratio. It expects the efficiency ratio to remain close to 31.5% for the full year. For the third quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 31%, reflecting a year-over-year improvement of 40 basis points.Other FactorsApart from increasing interest and fees on loans, strong deposit generation, loan receivables as well as increased online purchases are likely to drive revenues this quarter.The company’s revenues are also expected to increase on the back of rising CareCredit receivables this quarter.Strong value propositions and promotional offers in the cards are likely to boost active accounts growth, in turn, driving revenues.However, continued strong growth in lower yielding payment solution receivables is expected to put pressure on margins in the to-be-reported quarter.An increase in spending on strategic investments is expected drain the bottom line in the third quarter.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Synchrony Financial will beat on earnings this quarter.

286,AFL,"We expect Progressive Corporation (PGR  -  Free Report) to surpass expectations in third-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Oct 17.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Progressive has the right combination of two key ingredients to beat estimates.Zacks ESP: Progressive has an Earnings ESP of +2.14%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate of 41 cents per share is pegged higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 40 cents. A stock’s positive ESP indicates confidence about an earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Progressive carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which increases the predictive power of ESP as stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 have significantly higher chances of an earnings beat.Conversely, we caution against all Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into an earnings announcement.Factors Driving the Better-Than-Expected EarningsPremiums having been improving over the last few quarters, are expected to increase in the third quarter owing to solid policies in force across Personal and Commercial Lines.A gradually improving interest rate environment has likely driven investment income higher. These in turn will help top line rise year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is currently pegged at $6.8 billion, up 14.1%.Owing to a diversified product portfolio and competitive pricing, retention ratio has possibly remained solid.  An active catastrophe environment has deteriorated loss ratio in the soon-to-be-reported quarter. The company had already reported 12.6 loss ratio points of catastrophe losses for August due to Hurricane Harvey. Vehicle and Property businesses will be affected the most.With respect to the earnings trend, the company delivered positive surprises in two of the last four quarters with an average beat of 6.88%.  The company’s share price has been trending downward over the last few days and is currently trading at $48.67 per share.

287,AFL,"Plagued with the ongoing malaise due to a flurry of hurricanes and other catastrophes, the insurance industry seems to have lost much of its sheen to the investors at large. Their sentiments got further dampened by the Fed’s announcement to keep the interest rate unchanged at its most recently held meeting.Havoc Wreaked by Weather Related EventsHaving been blessed by Mother Nature for many years now, the insurance industry has of late faced its immense wrath. Although benign catastrophes in recent years had favored the property and casualty players, their severities took a worse turn with a slew of hurricane strikes namely, Harvey, Irma, Maria, affecting parts of the United States one after another.Economic losses from Irma are estimated at about $58-$83 billion while the same from Harvey could be as high as $108 billion by Moody’s Analytics. Catastrophe modeling firm AIR Worldwide estimates industry insured losses for Maria in the Caribbean between $40 billion and $85 billion.The AIR Worldwide firm has also provided an insurance industry loss projection following the huge impact of the 8.1 magnitude earthquake that hit Mexico in early September. The figure enormously ranges between $0.8 billion and $1.1 billion. Per the same global catastrophe risk modeler, the industry loss estimate is expected up to $2.1 billion, following another tremor that rocked Mexico on Sep 19, 2017.These losses are anticipated to create a dent in underwriting margins for the property and casualty insurers. Insurer The Allstate Corp. (ALL  -  Free Report) expects to incur a catastrophe (cat) loss of $593 million pretax ($385 million after tax) from Harvey.Another player, Infinity Property and Casualty Corporation, expects to suffer approximately $10-$15 million of weather-related loss.Low Interest Rates Add to WoesInterest rates are like a double-edged sword for the property and casualty insurers. Though low interest rates protect the value of bonds in their investment portfolio, it takes a toll on their investment yields. An increase in interest rates leads to higher investment income, which is another source of revenue for insurers.A near-zero interest rate from past many years has eaten into the insurers net investment income pie. Despite the rate hikes by the Fed (unchanged at the meeting concluded last month), interest rates remain pretty abnormally low to contribute meaningfully to investment income.Other headwinds the industry grapples with are soft pricing and stiff competition, prompting insurers to relax their rigid underwriting standards in order to gain more business. This exposes them to higher probability of incurring claim cost.How to Gamble With the Stocks for SurvivalThe uncertainty phase persisting in the industry makes it difficult for investors to pick up the right stock to invest in.The safest stock in this backdrop would be the one providing a steady stream of income. Significantly, the still-low interest rate scenario makes the dividend stocks a solid choice for investors looking for a steady benefit.A stock rewarding shareholders with consistent dividends would be the top stock pick in such a scenario.Here are some stocks that qualify our criteria:Aflac Inc. (AFL  -  Free Report) has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Notably, 2017 marks the 35th year of consecutive dividend growth. Its current dividend yield of 2.1% exceeds the industry’s metric of 1.9% that it belongs to.We expect the company to continue with the dividend growth path, backed by a favorable U.S business and a strong balance sheet.  Though the company is facing weakness in Japan business, chances are slim that its dividend policy will be affected by it.Cincinnati Financial Corp. (CINF  -  Free Report) has increased dividend for 56 consecutive years, an impressive feat achieved by only seven other U.S. public companies. It carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Its dividend yield of 2.6% outpaces the industry’s 0.5% yield. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.       .   There is no question of the company to deviate from the dividend growth track, given its strong diversified business, wide agent network, disciplined underwriting and a strong balance sheet, which should support future dividend growth.Old Republic International Corp. (ORI  -  Free Report) carrying a Zacks Rank #3, has raised dividend for 35 consecutive years. Its dividend yield of 3.9% is amply higher than the industry’s 1.9% tally.The company’s diversified revenue and earnings from general P&C and title insurance subsidiaries, good profitability, moderate use of financial leverage and high cash flow assure us of an impressive dividend growth story to continue in the long term.<!--{cke_protected}{C}%3C!%2D%2Dtd%20%7Bborder%3A%201px%20solid%20%23ccc%3B%7Dbr%20%7Bmso-data-placement%3Asame-cell%3B%7D%2D%2D%3E-->4 Stocks to Watch after the Massive Equifax HackCybersecurity stocks spiked on recent news of a data breach affecting 143 million Americans.

288,AFL,"The stock market has been on a stellar ride this year courtesy of a pickup in global economic activity, robust corporate earnings, and rising consumer confidence. But bouts of volatility and uncertainty have threatened the bull run lately.This is especially true as United States’ tensions with North Korea reached an alarming stage that could lead to a trade war with China, the largest trading partner of North Korea, thus sparking off threats of a global recession. Doubts over the implementation of Trump’s agenda, government shutdown fears, uncertain Fed policy as well as two hurricanes – Harvey aftermath and Irma – added to the gloom (read: ETFs to Lose If Trump Bans Trade With North Korean Partners).Amid these uncertainties, value investing appears safe and appealing to investors. The strategy includes stocks with strong fundamentals — earnings, dividends, book value and cash flow — that trade below their intrinsic value and are undervalued by the market.Why Value Investing?Value stocks often overreact to both positive and negative news, resulting in share price movement that does not reflect a company’s true long-term fundamentals.

289,AFL,"Aflac Inc. (AFL  -  Free Report) boasts an excellent franchise and strong market position in supplemental health insurance in both Japan and the U.S.  During the most recently reported quarter, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate and grew year over year, driven by favorable performance by its U.S. business along with share buyback. The 2017 guidance (earnings per share between $6.40 to $6.65 ) was also reaffirmed.Aflac U.S. continues to perform strongly as evident by increasing revenues since 2010 (CAGR of 3.1%) and the trend continued in the first half of 2017 (total revenue up 1.8%). The company has undertaken a number of growth initiatives in this segment, which will further drive up its revenues.    The company’s strong financial position and disciplined capital management are impressive. It has been increasing dividend for the past 34 years. The company intends to increase its dividend for the 35th time this year. Its dividend yield of 2.13% compares favorably with the industry’s dividend yield of 1.99%. It recently authorized a new share buyback plan of 40 million shares.The company’s stock has gained 16% year to date, outperforming the 14% rally of the industry it belongs to. Given its favorable 2017 earnings guidance and progress on fundamentals, we expect the stock to continue to perform well in the coming quarters.Nevertheless, persistent low interest rates in the region have put pressure on revenue growth from Japan business.  In order to fight with this, the company has deemphasized sales of first-sector (life insurance) products in the region, which has created a dent in revenues from the segment to some extent.Aflac is in the process of converting its Japan branch into a subsidiary, which will provide it enhanced business flexibility. The company expects to incur conversion costs of $120 million to $130 million pretax through mid-2018. These costs will hurt the company’s margins in the coming quarters.Given that the company derives almost 70% of total revenues from Japan, it is greatly exposed to foreign currency volatility. A weaker yen hurt second-quarter results by 2 cents a share when compared to the year-ago quarter. Its pre-tax hedge cost guidance remains in the $250–$270 million range for 2017. These costs will put pressure on the company’s bottom line.Aflac carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked players in the space are Amerisafe, Inc. (AMSF  -  Free Report), Employer Holdings, Inc. (EIG  -  Free Report) and Unum Group (UNM  -  Free Report). Each of these stocks carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Amerisafe’s second-quarter earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 13.9%.Unum beat estimates in each of the last four quarters with an average positive surprise of 3.1%.Employer Holdings beat estimates in each of the last four quarters with an average positive surprise of 27.9%.5 Trades Could Profit ""Big-League"" from Trump PoliciesIf the stocks above spark your interest, wait until you look into companies primed to make substantial gains from Washington's changing course.
