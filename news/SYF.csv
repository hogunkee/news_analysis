3,SYF,"American Century Ultra Fund (TWCUX) got it right with Wabtec (WAB) — also known as Westinghouse Air Brake.The $11.4 billion portfolio is underweight in industrials, but its managers nonetheless made room for the locomotive equipment maker, starting in 2010. ""Wabtec fits our quality, durable-growth philosophy based on the management team, their track record and a business with a strong operating margin averaging 17% over the last five years,"" client portfolio manager Kevin Lewis told IBD. ""Further, the company has sustainable growth opportunities in aftermarket sales, which are high margin, and also due to strong demand for active safety and improved emission products that they produce.""On news of its agreement to merge with the diesel locomotive business of Dow Jones industrials veteran General Electric (GE) in an $11 billion deal, Wabtec was full steam ahead on Monday, chugging forward nearly 4%. Shares retreated 1% on Tuesday. It lost about another 1% on Wednesday and was up Thursday morning. That left the stock ahead about 19% for this year. Wabtec shareholders will own 49.9% of the combined company. Lewis said, ""We believe the structure of the merger makes sense and view favorably that Wabtec management remains in control and is leading the merged company.""The fund's managers hope to hit similar jackpots with other holdings in leading stocks such as Netflix (NFLX), Amazon.com (AMZN) and Abiomed (ABMD). Those stocks have gained 73%, 35% and 106% respectively this year.Overall, the fund aims to invest in companies whose fundamentals are strong and getting better, but where growth is not fully reflected in their share prices.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseUltra Fund's success with that strategy is reflected in its 24.85% gain over the 12 months going into Wednesday. That outperformed 78% of its large-cap growth rivals tracked by Morningstar Inc.Ultra is a bottom-up portfolio. It invests stock by stock. Buys and sells are not dictated by sectors or macro factors. Still, there are some broad themes that make some industries more likely ponds for the managers to reel in catches.One is the technology sector, where the managers see lots of growth stock stories. Information technology ended Q1 as the portfolio's largest overweight. ""We continue to find strong growth opportunities through bottom-up fundamental analysis,"" managers Keith Lee, Michael Li and Jeffrey Bourke told shareholders in their latest commentary. In the first quarter, the fund added to its stakes in Facebook (FB) and PayPal (PYPL).Netflix has IBD's highest-possible Composite Rating of 99. Stocks with a Composite Rating of 95 or higher are considered leaders. Netflix offers TV shows and movies to subscription customers via the internet.Netflix is the most-watched streaming service, viewed by 46% of respondents, up from 42% a year ago, according to a recent report by Morgan Stanley (MS). Original programming is the main draw for Netflix.Amazon Prime Video is the third most-watched streaming service. It now captures 30% of viewers polled by Morgan Stanley. That was up from 27% a year ago.Amazon's earnings per share were flat then grew 40% and 121% the most recent quarters. Trading around 1,584, shares are just above a 1,568.62 buy point.PayPal, a tech name to which the fund added, in November agreed to sell its U.S. consumer credit business to Synchrony Financial (SYF) for $5.8 billion. Last week, PayPal agreed to buy Sweden's iZettle for $2.2 billion. That would be its biggest acquisition since being spun off by eBay (EBAY).Potential new investors have balked at PayPal's high level of stock-based compensation, according to Morgan Stanley analyst James Faucette.Health care is another sector where the managers find a lot of growth stories. The fund's overweight in health care vs. its Russell 1000 Growth Index benchmark was its second largest overweight as of March 31.""Valuations of drug and medical supplies companies have corrected, and we see opportunity where earnings growth is driven by innovation,"" the managers said in their commentary. ""Despite potential measures to control drug pricing, drug pipelines are robust, with ample clinical trial readouts.""A maker of cardiac pumping devices, Abiomed is another stock with IBD's best-possible Composite Rating of 99. Trading around 390, shares are extended from a 304.38 buy point in a late-stage base.The stock ranks No. 1 in IBD's medical-products industry group. In turn, that group ranks a very strong No. 3 out of 197 groups. Leaders in strong industries get that way by showing superior earnings growth and sales. Abiomed got to the top of its industry group in part by growing earnings per share in four straight years and by posting a 44% three-year EPS growth rate.In addition to Abiomed, holdings include Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) and UnitedHealth Group (UNH).YOU MAY ALSO LIKE:Maximize Your Social Security Benefits: How To ApplyYou Need This Much Retirement Savings At Your Age And Income

6,SYF,"Citigroup (C) reported strong results for the fourth quarter Tuesday and said a $22 billion charge won't change how much money it plans to pay out to shareholders. The bank stock flirted with a buy point, but has been lagging the general market in recent weeks.X Estimates: EPS to rise 4.4% to $1.19 as revenue grows 0.5% to $17.09 billion, according to Zacks Investment Research.Results: EPS of $1.28, excluding a charge of $8.43 a share related to the tax law, on revenue of $17.3 billion. Global consumer banking revenue grew 6% to $8.4 billion. International clients group revenue dipped 1% to $8.1 billion, as fixed income trading revenue sank 18% to $2.4 billion while banking revenue climbed 14% to $4.7 billion.While Citigroup booked a $22 billion charge to account for the tax changes, the effect on capital that regulators scrutinize was ""much less significant,"" said CEO Michael Corbat in a statement, noting the annual bank ""stress tests,"" or Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR), that's used to determine how much in buybacks and dividends banks can pay out.""Tax reform does not change our capital return goals as we remain committed to returning at least $60 billion of capital in the current and next two CCAR cycles, subject to regulatory approval,"" he said. ""Tax reform not only leads to higher net income and increased returns, but also serves to strengthen our capital generation capabilities going forward.""Stock: Shares rallied 0.5% to 77.22 on the stock market today. Citigroup briefly hit 78.44, above a 78.02 flat-base buy point. But Citi's relative strength line has been in a downtrend and below the base's peak, meaning any breakout has greater odds of failing.JPMorgan Chase (JPM), which beat forecasts Friday, fell 0.4%. Wells Fargo (WFC), which turned in mixed results Friday, dipped 0.1%.IBD'S TAKE: Buying or holding a stock can be risky heading into an earnings report.

7,SYF,"The House re-approved the $1.5 trillion Trump tax cuts Wednesday after the Senate OK'd the measure in the morning with a 51-48 vote. The bill now heads to President Trump's desk. The House had to revisit Tuesday's vote due to procedural issues.X Now the focus on Wall Street is figuring out just how big of a bonanza the new 21% corporate tax rate will be for corporate America and how much of a boost to earnings investors should expect.On Monday, Goldman Sachs said that Wells Fargo (WFC) stands to gain the most among the biggest U.S. banks from the tax package, with a 17% earnings boost. Beyond the corporate rate cut, the legislation also limits the deductibility of FDIC premiums and limits the ability of companies to deduct past losses, which would hit Citigroup the hardest. After Wells Fargo, Goldman sees PNC Financial Services (PNC) and Bank of America (BAC) as the biggest winners, with expected earnings increases of 15% and 14%.BofA Merrill Lynch analyst Kenneth Bruce upgraded credit-card issuers Capital One Financial (COF), Discover Financial Services (DFS) and Synchrony Financial (SYF) to neutral from buy on Monday and reiterated a buy rating on American Express (AXP), saying tax legislation wasn't fully priced in to the stocks. Bruce sees a 15%-25% boost to EPS, with Discover and Synchrony near the top of the range and Capital One and AmEx both poised for a 17% EPS increase.Delta Air Lines (DAL) CEO Ed Bastian told analysts last week that a 21% corporate tax rate would cut its tax bill by $800 million a year, the Financial Times reported. The tax legislation would boost Delta's 2018 earnings by $1 per share above current guidance of $5.35 to $5.70 per share. That amounts to roughly an 18% EPS bump. Beyond the lower corporate rate, airlines will benefit from being able to immediately deduct the cost of aircraft purchases. Data from IBD's parent corporation, William O'Neil & Co., show that Alaska Air Group (ALK) has the highest effective tax rate, 38%, among U.S. airlines.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column every day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines. As long as the current ""confirmed uptrend"" — the equivalent of a green light — stays in place, leading stocks breaking above a buy point are more likely than not to have the wind at their backs. Here's a good place to start looking for stocks that may be poised to move higher.""Companies with businesses that are primarily domestic-focused tend to have higher tax rates on average. Similarly, small-cap stocks, which are generally more U.S.-centric, could see strong earnings revisions,"" wrote William O'Neil chief investment strategist Randy Watts and senior equity analyst Romeo Alvarez. Among S&P 500 sectors, ""Energy currently has the highest corporate tax rate and would see major relief.""The data show Marathon Oil (MRO) with a 49.9% effective tax rate and ConocoPhillips (COP) paying a 46.9% rate.Energy stocks were big winners Thursday. Conoco Philips jumped 3%, nearly breaking out to a buy zone on the stock market today. Marathon Oil was among the many energy stocks moving toward entry points. Diamondback Energy (FANG) did blast out into buy range in strong volume.CVS Health (CVS) has a 38.9% effective tax rate, tops among consumer staples companies, according to William O'Neil data. Aetna (AET), another high-tax company, is being acquired by CVS as it braces for the entry of Amazon.com into the retail prescription business. CEO Larry Merlo said recently that CVS would take some of its tax windfall and reinvest it in reconfiguring its stores to provide more health services.RELATED:6 Big Rule Changes For Individuals In The New Tax BillTrump Tax Package Seen Boosting These Players In Info TechHere's How Much Trump Tax Cuts Will Boost Profits At These Banking GiantsFederal Reserve Gives Trump Tax Cuts A Green LightFive Reasons Why JPMorgan, Citigroup, Other Financials Are Seizing Market Leadership

14,SYF,"Synchrony Financial's (SYF) warning that its net charge-off rates would be worse than anticipated over the next year sent shares diving Tuesday, also dragging down American Express (AXP), Discover Financial Services (DFS) and Capital One (COF).Synchrony, a recent General Electric (GE) spinoff that provides private-label credit cards to a variety of businesses, said it expected a 20-30 basis point increase in net charge-off rates -- a measure of debt that a company no longer expects to get back and has deemed a loss -- and would build up reserves accordingly in Q2.Shares plunged 13.3% to close at 26.45 in the stock market today, undercutting their 50- and 200-day moving averages.

The 30-plus-day performing delinquency rate for auto loans edged up to 5.48% vs. a year earlier.But while Capital One CFO Stephen Crawford pointed to “an accelerating increase in consumer debt” -- potentially even in subprime loans -- other financial metrics prompted the card-issuing giant not to change its loss forecast. Credit stability has held up in recent years as well.""The other side of that message is, there will be a turn,"" he warned at a Morgan Stanley financials conference. ""And one should just anticipate that that’s going to happen at some point in time.""On Tuesday, Synchrony, which issues private-label credit cards, said it expects a slightly higher net charge-off rate -- an indication of credit that a firm writes off as a loss because it no longer expects to be repaid -- over the next 12 months.Synchrony, which was recently spun off from General Electric (GE), said the rate was still ""historically low"" but that consumers this year have had a harder time paying off debt. Concerns have grown that debt from credit cards and auto loans, among other things, could be rising to less-comfortable levels.Meanwhile, Alliance Data Systems (ADS), which provides consumer and commercial lending and auto financing, said the delinquency rate within its card services segment rose to 4.4% as of May 31 from 3.9% a year earlier.Capital One shares ended trading up 0.3% on the stock market today, after diving 6.6% Tuesday.

Shares are now well below their 200-day and 50-day moving average lines. The drop may be in sympathy with Synchrony Financial (SYF), which plunged 16% after the private-label credit card provider forecast net charge-off rates to rise 20 to 30 basis points. That implies more customers are late on payments.Other credit card issuers and payment processors getting hit included Capital One Financial (COF), down more than 7%, and Discover Financial Services (DFS), which fell over 4%, both in hefty turnover.Smith & Wesson fell 5% to below its 200-day line after a sharp downward reversal.

AbbVie (ABBV), another top holding at 9.5%, has swooned 26% and hurt the fund relatively more.Renaissance IPO's top components had their IPOs since 2014. First Trust U.S. IPO has companies that went public farther back. General Motors (GM), certainly no new kid on the block, is on the First Trust portfolio. It started trading again after its reorganization in 2010.Within the IPO Leaders screen, Physicians Realty Trust (DOC) has faltered since it cleared the 17.23 buy point of a cup with handle last month, but shares are just 7% off the prior high.Store Capital (STOR) is near a new high, extended from a breakout past 23.23.

Under the plan, GE expects to generate over 90% of its earnings from its industrial businesses by 2018, up from 58% in 2014.GE can accomplish its plan on schedule, though there are execution risks, given the size of GE Capital, says Logan Purk, senior equity analyst for Edward Jones.""Before, it was selling slivers here and there,"" he told IBD. ""They say they have interested parties, but I tend to be more 'I'll believe it when I see it.' It's not small.""GE's two-year time frame comes during a ""decent market,"" barring a global economic setback, but ""pricing is a wild card,"" he added, noting there's a chance buyers won't pay book value for GE Capital's assets.Shares jumped 7.4% in the stock market today to their highest level in more than a year.GE said its industrial businesses are on track for operating EPS of $1.10-$1.20. But not all its financial businesses are going away.It's keeping its aircraft leasing operations, GE Capital Aviation Services, and lending arms for energy and health care, as they are smaller operations that support GE's industrial focus.""This is a major step in our strategy to focus GE around its competitive advantages,"" GE CEO Jeff Immelt said in a statement. ""The team is executing a detailed plan to boost margins and returns. We are allocating capital to grow the company and benefit investors.""The move comes after GE spun off its private-label credit card provider, Synchrony Financial (SYF), last year.In an initial step to shed GE Capital, the company plans to sell $26.5 billion in office buildings and other commercial space to Blackstone Group (BX) and Wells Fargo (WFC).The board also authorized a $50 billion share buyback as GE expects to reduce its share count to 8 billion -8.5 billion by 2018.Follow Gillian Rich on Twitter: @IBD_GRich.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $3.9 billion, reflecting 8.3% year over year increase.The company’s agreement with PayPal during the fourth quarter of 2017 supporting its consistent reach within the rapidly-growing digital payments channel is likely to aid first-quarter results.Share buybacks and a lower tax incidence due to tax rate cut will likely provide additional boost to the bottom-line.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 74 cents, increasing 21.3% year over year.However, increase in lower yielding payment solution receivables is will likely weigh on margin expansion in the first quarter.Also, a rise in spending on strategic investments is assumed to hurt the bottom line in the to-be-reported quarter.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Synchrony Financial is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Synchrony Financial has an Earnings ESP of -2.02%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Synchrony Financial Price and EPS Surprise Synchrony Financial Price and EPS Surprise | Synchrony Financial Quote Zacks Rank: Synchrony Financial carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, a company needs to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise. Hence, this combination leaves surprise prediction inconclusive. We caution against Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies from the same industry that you may want to consider as these have the right combination of elements to beat estimates this time around:CIT Group, Inc.

132,SYF,"For Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), sky is the limit. Being one of the biggest companies in the United States, the sheer possibility of its entry into a particular industry can make the existing participants feel threatened.Already this e-commerce behemoth has its presence in almost every aspect of people’s life. This includes traditional, brick-and-mortar retailing, reading or listening to books (Kindle), streaming music and videos (Prime Instant Video and Amazon Originals), web storage and computing services and shipping.  Further, the company has Prime rewards credit card from JPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report) and Amazon.com Store card from Synchrony Financial (SYF  -  Free Report). Also, it has entered the health insurance business in January 2018 with its partnership with JPMorgan and Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B  -  Free Report). Even there are reports that the company is looking to get into pharma and home furnishing industries.It looks like nothing is left untouched by Amazon. So, Amazon’s entry in to the banking industry shouldn’t be a big surprise.Amazon in Partnership with JPMorgan to Enter Banking?Early last week, the Wall Street Journal reported that Amazon is in talks with JPMorgan to develop “checking-account-like” product for its millennial consumers. The partnership may include the ability to pay bills and/or access the bank’s ATM network. Such a deal could unite the country’s biggest e-commerce platform with the largest bank of the nation.While the discussions are at an early stage, this represents Amazon’s further foray into traditional brick-and-mortar banks, mainly dominated by big lenders. The company already offers loans in the range of $1,000 to $750,000 to small businesses through its Marketplace platform and has originated more than $3 billion loans since the launch in 2011.Amazon’s primary goal seems to be able to carter to young and underbanked consumers, who otherwise find it difficult to shop online. The partnership will also enable it to further grow its Prime membership via cross-selling to current JPMorgan clients. These will likely spur more online sales.The other advantage is not facing regulatory barriers. It’s known that the banking industry is highly regulated. So, for Amazon, partnership with JPMorgan will likely do away with regulatory compliance.Amazon Advantage: Survey Supports Amazon's EntryA survey by Bain & Company recently revealed that U.S. and U.K. customers ranked Amazon almost as high as traditional banks in terms of trusting with their money. It disclosed that more than 50% of the U.S. respondents are ready to purchase a financial product from an established tech company, with Amazon at the top of the list, followed by Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) and Google.With almost double the market capitalization (roughly $770 billion) of the country’s largest bank (JPMorgan has a market cap of roughly $400 billion) Amazon will likely be a success in the banking industry driven by the following advantages:1. Established brand and excellent service provider (no big data breach till now)2. Knows all about its customers’ income and spending habits3. Digital relationship with customers will be helpful in avoiding client acquisition cost4. No branch and contact center network required5. Easy payment options6. Global reach7. Huge customer data base will be useful in offering other financial products eventuallyEntry of tech companies in the financial services industry is already happening in Asia. China’s e-commerce giant Alibaba’s (BABA  -  Free Report) financial affiliate Ant Financial has witnessed tremendous growth over the last couple of years. Similarly, Japan’s e-commerce company Rakuten operates the country’s one of the largest credit card firms by transaction value.Therefore, Amazon can definitely amaze us with its entry into the banking industry.This is a surprise for traditional banks that till now thought small fintech startups as a big threat to their market share. But tech companies are a bigger threat.Amazon’s Entry Disruptive to Banks’ Market Share?Amazon’s entry in to banking sector will not be as easy as it seems on the paper. The Bank Holding Company Act prevents commercial companies from also getting into banking activities.While the U.S. policymakers are skeptical about the entry of a commercial company into the banking industry, this may change with time. Last year, at a conference, Keith Noreika, the temporary head of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, stated that it’s time to re-consider whether separation should be maintained between traditional banks and retail firms.Bain & Company believes that over the next five years, Amazon’s banking services will likely attract more than 70 million customers, making it the third largest bank in the United States and surpassing Well Fargo’s (WFC  -  Free Report) banking client base. Therefore, Amazon’s entry into traditional banking domain will definitely have an adverse impact on banks’ market share.As customers are getting more comfortable with the use of digital technology (online and mobile banking), banks must gear up and improve their digital offerings to counter tech firms’ incursion into their turf. While banks have started making efforts on this front, those initiatives are still in a nascent stage.Therefore, to counter Amazon and other tech companies, banks need to catch up and fill the lag at a faster pace. Instead of pushing products to the clients, banks need to put the customers first and make major changes about how to carter to requirements of millennials.So, it’s not the time for banks to panic. They can counter tech firms’ entry as they are in the business for quite long and know the nitty and gritty of it. Only they need to catch up with the customers’ needs.Zacks Top 10 Stocks for 2018In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest buy-and-hold tickers for the entirety of 2018? Last year's 2017 Zacks Top 10 Stocks portfolio produced double-digit winners, including FMC Corp. and VMware which racked up stellar gains of +67.9% and +61%.

135,SYF,"With markets in correction mode, it’s very difficult to select stocks that will offer steady returns going forward. Investors may apply complex investment strategies with an aim to book higher returns but may not be rewarded with the desired returns.Thus, at present, investors should use conventional strategies, based on key fundamentals, to select stocks. One such strategy is focus on sales growth.Why Sales Growth?Investors often fail to keep an eye on sales growth while picking stocks, as a company’s share price is usually sensitive to its earnings momentum. Nonetheless, earnings are not the be-all and end-all in the sense that books can be easily manipulated. That’s why sales should always be taken into consideration.Sales growth is actually an important indicator of a company's health and ability to sustain its business. It offers investors an insight into product demand and pricing power. The main advantage is that the sales figure is generally not manipulated and is less volatile than earnings.Without some revenue growth, bottom-line improvement may not be sustainable in the longer term. While a company can show earnings strength by reducing expenses, a sustainable bottom-line recovery usually requires sales growth.Focusing exclusively on sales growth is not enough though. A healthy sales growth rate is certainly a positive indicator for picking good stocks, but it does not ensure profits. So, taking into consideration a company’s cash position along with its sales number can prove to be a more dependable strategy.Substantial cash on hand and a steady cash flow give a company more flexibility with respect to business decisions and potential investments. Cash also enables a company to endure market downturns. Most importantly, a sufficient cash position indicates that revenues are being channelized in the right direction.Selecting the Winning StocksIn order to shortlist stocks that have witnessed impressive sales growth along with a high cash balance, we have selected 5-Year Historical Sales Growth (%) greater than X-Industry and Cash Flow greater than $500 million as our main screening parameters.But sales growth and cash strength are not the absolute criteria for selecting stocks. So, we added certain other factors to arrive at a winning strategy.Price-to-Sales (P/S) Ratio less than X-Industry: This metric determines the value placed on each dollar of a company’s revenues. The lower the ratio, the better it is for picking a stock since the investor is paying less for each unit of sales.% Change F1 Sales Estimate Revisions (4 Weeks) greater than X-Industry: Better-than-industry estimate revision has often been seen to trigger an increase in the stock price.Operating Margin (Average Last 5 years) greater than 5%: Operating margin measures how much every dollar of a company's sales translates into profits. A high ratio indicates that the company has good cost control and sales are increasing faster than costs, an optimal situation for the company.Return on Equity (ROE) greater than 5%: This metric will ensure that sales growth is translated into profits and the company is not hoarding cash. A high ROE means the company is spending wisely and is in all likelihood profitable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Here are five of the 20 stocks that qualified the screening:Based in Seattle, WA, Starbucks (SBUX  -  Free Report) operates as a roaster, marketer, and retailer of specialty coffee. The company has expected sales growth rate of 10.6% for the current fiscal year and carries a Zacks Rank #2.W.W.

138,SYF,"Synchrony Financial (SYF  -  Free Report) will release fourth-quarter 2017 results on Jan 19, 2018 before the market opens.Despite improving credit metrics, the company expects an increase in its allowance for loan losses from the prior-year period due to seasonal trends and catastrophic events.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for allowance for loan losses is currently pegged at $5.6 billion, up nearly 30% year over year.Nevertheless, the company’s total interest and fees on loans are expected to increase in the fourth quarter, continuing the previous trend.

140,SYF,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Synchrony Financial (SYF  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Synchrony Financial has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 14.73, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 21.49. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, Synchrony Financial’s current PE level marks the highs for the stock over the past few years.Further, the stock’s PE compares favorably with the Zacks Finance sector’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 16.92. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is undervalued right now, compared to its peers. We should also point out that Synchrony Financial’s forward PE is roughly same as its trailing twelve months value, so we might say that the forward earnings estimates are incorporated in the company’s share price as of now. We define forward PE as current price relative to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current fiscal year.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Synchrony Financial has a P/S ratio of about 1.86. This is much lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.40 right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this stands below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Synchrony Financial currently has a Value Score of A, putting it into the top 20% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes Synchrony Financial a solid choice for value investors.What About the Stock Overall?Though Synchrony Financial might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of C and a Momentum Score of F. This gives SYF a Zacks VGM score — or its overarching fundamental grade — of B. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been quite discouraging. The current quarter has seen six estimates go lower in the past sixty days compared to no upward revisions, while the full year estimate has seen five downward and one upward revision in the same time period.This has had a negative impact on the consensus estimate, as the current quarter consensus estimate has dropped by 4.4% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has inched lower by 0.8%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Synchrony Financial Price and Consensus  Synchrony Financial Price and Consensus | Synchrony Financial QuoteGiven these bearish trends, the stock has just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which is why we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineSynchrony Financial is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Despite having a Zacks Rank #3, the stock belongs to an industry which is ranked among the Top 45% out of more than 250 Zacks industries, which indicates that broader factors are favorable for the company.So, value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.      Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021. Early investors stand to make a killing, but you have to be ready to act and know just where to look.See the pot trades we're targeting>>

141,SYF,"Shares of PayPal (PYPL  -  Free Report) rose premarket on Monday morning after the company announced it reached a deal with an investment startup in order to offer its customers robotic trading options. The online and mobile payment powerhouse announced on Monday that it is set to partner with Acorns Grow Inc. to allow PayPal users to invest or set up a savings account with the five-year-old automated investment startup. PayPal users will have the option to link their funds to an Acorns investment account. Users can then choose between one-time investment options or make recurring payments. The connected payments giant hopes to give its users the ability to save more easily and create a stable, long-term financial plan. PayPal users who elect to set up an account with Acorns will be able to monitor the activity through PayPal’s online portal or mobile app.The San Jose, California-based company said it debuted this Acorns investment option to select PayPal customers in the U.S. today. PayPal will roll out the offering to its entire U.S. customer base by early 2018. Previously, PayPal users had been able to save and invest money through Acorns “Round-up” feature, which allows users to automatically invest in various low-cost, diversified portfolios of ETFs by rounding PayPal purchases up to the nearest dollar. “Together, Acorns and PayPal are helping democratize financial services and offering innovative solutions to the people typically underserved by the current system,” PayPal VP of Consumer Financial Services Joanna Lambert wrote in a statement. The company’s push into robotic—or more passive automated investment—comes after it took a minority stake in Acorns about a year ago during a $30 million fundraising round for the startup.Acorns gears its services towards mobile-focused millennials and people who might find it hard to make investments in traditional ways. The micro-investing app currently boasts more than 2.3 million U.S. users. PayPal shares surged before the opening bell and are currently up around 0.70%. On Friday, the payments company climbed to a new all-time high after announcing that it made a deal with Synchrony Financial (SYF  -  Free Report) to sell the firm roughly $6 billion worth of loans it made to online shoppers. PayPal investors then jumped on the stock, as the company plans to use the cash infusion for acquisitions and or share buybacks.PayPal continues to try to bolster the variety of financial services it offers its customers. This new Acorns relationship comes after PayPal struck deals with over 20 new partners—including Facebook (FB  -  Free Report), Baidu (BIDU  -  Free Report), and JPMorgan Chase (JPM  -  Free Report)—all within the last year and a half. On top of that, the PayPal now partners with credit card giants Visa V) and Mastercard (MA  -  Free Report)—two brands that it has previously been at odds with. The company is also expanding its reach on a larger global scale.Before today’s announcement, PayPal’s stock price had already skyrocketed over 93% in 2017.

149,SYF,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Synchrony Financial (SYF  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Synchrony Financial has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 11.25, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 compares in at about 20.50. If we focus on the stock’s long-term PE trend, the current level puts Synchrony Financial’s current PE ratio almost in line with its midpoint over the past five years, with the number remaining somewhat stable over the past few months.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks classified Financial - Miscellaneous Services sector’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 18.77. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that Synchrony Financial has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of 11.35, which is tad higher than the current level. So it is fair to expect an increase in the company’s share price in the near term.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Synchrony Financial has a P/S ratio of about 1.55. This is significantly lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.18 right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.If anything, SYF is roughly near the lower end of its range in the time period from a P/S metric, suggesting some level of undervalued trading—at least compared to historical norms.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Synchrony Financial currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of ‘A’, putting it into the top 20% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes Synchrony Financial a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, the PEG ratio for Synchrony Financial is just 1.25, a level that is relatively lower than the industry average of 1.86. The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock’s earnings growth rate. Clearly, SYF is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.What About the Stock Overall?Though Synchrony Financial might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of ‘C’ and a Momentum score of ‘F’. This gives SYF a Zacks VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of ‘B’. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been unimpressive. The current quarter has seen four estimates go lower in the past sixty days compared to one lower, while the full year estimate has seen four down and one up in the same time period.This has had just a notable impact on the consensus estimate as the current quarter consensus estimate has decreased by 3.3% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has dropped by 0.1%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Synchrony Financial Price and Consensus  Synchrony Financial Price and Consensus | Synchrony Financial QuoteDespite the bearish analyst sentiments, the stock holds a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Bottom LineSynchrony Financial is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Furthermore, a strong industry rank (among Top 48% of more than 250 industries) instills our confidence on the stock.However with a Zacks Rank #3, it is hard to get too excited about this company overall. In fact, over the past two years, the Zacks Financial - Miscellaneous Services industry has clearly underperformed the broader market, as you can see below:So, value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.
