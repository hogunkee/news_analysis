0,HOG,"Is Trumponomics having a second honeymoon? The IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index surged to the 2nd-highest level since 2004 as the jobless rate matched a nearly 50-year low, the Nasdaq briefly scaled new heights and President Donald Trump pushed contentious immigration and trade policies.The IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index rose 2.5 points to 56.4 in July, just off February's 13-year high of 56.7. Readings above the neutral 50 level reflect optimism.It's hard to ignore the role of Trumponomics. In fact, Americans' view of federal government economic policies, almost always negative since the financial crisis, vaulted into solidly optimistic territory for the first time since late 2006. Midwesterners haven't felt so good about federal policies since early 2002, and rural voters even longer than that.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe Economic Optimism Index is a composite of three major subindexes.

All three rose in July, but the federal policies index led the surge.The six-month economic outlook gauge climbed 2.2 points to 53.4. That's a solid reading but still well below February's 57.5, two months after President Trump signed the tax cuts into law.The six-month personal financial outlook index gained seven-tenths of a point to 62.8, still below January's 14-year high of 64.Meanwhile, the measure of confidence in federal economic policies jumped 4.6 points to 52.9. The gauge hit 58.9 in the Midwest and 54.1 in the South. It remained in slightly pessimistic territory in the more-liberal West and Northeast. In rural areas, the federal policy gauge soared to 63.5 vs. 53.0 in suburban areas and 41.6 in urban areas.Despite a volatile stock market, the S&P 500 index rose in June, its fourth straight monthly gain.

1,HOG,"The Trump administration has provoked many an eye roll by justifying a threat to impose auto tariffs based on national security, but the North American subsidiary of Toyota (TM) warned Friday that Trump tariffs on autos would actually undermine national security.Other automakers also panned the Trump tariffs. General Motors (GM) warned the Commerce Department that Trump tariffs would ""lead to a smaller GM, a reduced presence at home and abroad for this iconic American company."" The National Association of Manufacturers said the tariffs would ""put the U.S. manufacturing sector at a global disadvantage, undermining growth and job creation throughout the United States.""Any time a company is willing to take issue with Trump's trade policy, there's always a chance of blowback. Harley-Davidson (HOG) experienced that this week with its plan to dodge the European Union's 25% tariff, levied in retaliation for Trump's steel and aluminum tariffs. Trump blasted Harley-Davidson's plan to move production of European-bound motorcycles offshore as waving the ""white flag.""In commenting on the Commerce Department's Section 232 national security investigation of motor vehicles and parts, Toyota Motor North America stressed that it was commenting not on behalf of its Japanese parent, but on behalf of its 37,000 U.S. employees, and the 367,000 workers employed at its suppliers and dealerships in the U.S.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

The company said that overall U.S. auto sales could fall by 2 million cars if automakers pass on the cost of the tariffs.

3,HOG,"Even as President Donald Trump has hit trading partners around the globe with tariffs and sought to carve out protections for key U.S. industries, he has called for tearing down trade barriers. Now the European Union is responding to Trump tariffs with carrots as well as sticks.The European Commission, the EU's executive branch, said Wednesday that 25% tariffs on $3.2 billion worth of American imports, including Harley-Davidson (HOG) motorcycles, will take effect on Friday. Eventually, the slice of U.S. imports hit with EU tariffs could more than double.Yet at the same time, German automakers are moving to head off an expanded Trump trade war threat of a 25% tariff on U.S. imports of European cars. The Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday that Daimler (DDAIF), BMW (BMWYY) and Volkswagen (VLKAY) have pitched the idea of both sides killing their auto tariffs, which stand at 10% in the EU vs. 2.5% in the U.S. Daimler has good reason to want a deal.Commerce Department Secretary Wilbur Ross responded positively to the idea, but it comes with a big catch: The German automakers also want the U.S. to kill a 25% tax on imports of pickup trucks and SUVs.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

It intends to debut its first motorcycle EV, part of ""Project LiveWire,"" next year.""Earlier this year, as part of our 10-year strategy, we reiterated our commitment to build the next generation of Harley-Davidson riders, in part, by aggressively investing in electric vehicle (EV) technology,"" Harley-Davidson CEO Matt Levatich said in a press release.

5,HOG,"Donald Trump's presidency has been pretty great for stock investors, but it carries three big risks that all are in focus this week: The Fed, a trade war and the investigation into Russia's role in the 2016 election.XThe Trump wall of worry helped get stocks off to a poor start on Monday, as Facebook (FB) led markets lower over how the social network permitted a third party to access user data that helped the Trump campaign. The Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 index fell 1.3% and 1.4%, respectively, on the stock market today. The Nasdaq slid 1.8%, but off intraday lows of more than 2%.All the fiscal stimulation from tax cuts and a big spending increase raises the risk of a more hawkish Fed. Federal Reserve policymakers are virtually certain to announce a 25-basis-point hike in the key overnight lending rate to banks on Wednesday at 2 p.m. ET. The risk this week is that they'll pencil in a tighter path for future policy than markets currently expect.Meanwhile, President Trump's 15-day grace period for trading partners to negotiate their way out of tariffs comes to an end on Friday, when levies of 25% on steel imports and 10% on aluminum imports go into effect.The White House said last week that it's negotiating with a number of countries, but provided no detail. The European Union said last week that it's not negotiating, but making a case that the tariffs are a poor way to treat a security partner, even as it detailed a list of $3.4 billion worth of American products that could face retaliatory tariffs, including Harley-Davidson (HOG) motorcycles, Jack Daniels whiskey and Florida orange juice.The third risk hanging over stocks as the week starts comes from the broadening Russia probe, which has now expanded to cover Trump Organization business deals before the election. Trump amped up his Twitter attacks on Special Counsel Robert Mueller's probe over the weekend, calling it a witch hunt, while his attorney John Dowd called for an end to the investigation that he said was ""manufactured"" by ex-FBI Director James Comey based on ""a fraudulent and corrupt dossier.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseNone of these three risk hanging over stocks will come to a head this week, but all three risks are growing and are likely to occupy investors for months to come.The Mueller investigation ""appears to be on the verge of a major inflection point,"" wrote Greg Valliere, chief global strategist at Horizon Investments. Mueller reportedly has submitted some of the questions he would like Trump to answer under oath. There's speculation that more indictments could be coming soon and major uncertainty over how Congress would react if Trump engineers Mueller's firing as GOP lawmakers have shown a tepid response to proposed legislation that would protect Mueller.At the Fed, inflation concerns haven't gone away, even with some favorable recent data. Despite expectations of faster economic growth this year, the tame consumer price index reading for February makes it an even bet whether Fed policymakers will pencil in a fourth rate hike in 2018, up from three, in their economic projections that are released at the same time as the policy statement.Yet as wage growth accelerates in coming months — and there's every reason to expect it will after wage hikes from Walmart (WMT), Target (TGT), CVS Health (CVS), Starbucks (SBUX), Bank of America (BAC) and dozens of other big employers — a more hawkish Fed is likely.On trade, Trump's indefinite exemptions for Canada and Mexico from tariffs have contained the potential fallout from his duties on steel and aluminum, and the White House may be open to other approaches to reducing global steel overcapacity that comes mainly from China, even though China accounts for just 2% of U.S. steel imports.Still, the risk of a trade war is rising. If steel and aluminum tariffs don't spark one, it may come from a U.S. crackdown on China's intellectual property practices. On Monday, Reuters reported that Walmart, Target, Best Buy (BBY) and other retailers sent a letter to Trump asking him to reconsider an emerging plan to hit Beijing with $60 billion in tariffs on American imports of apparel, electronics and other goods. Boeing (BA) and Apple (AAPL) are seen as likely targets for reprisal by China if a trade war erupts.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Inflation And The Fed Rate-Hike Outlook: What You Need To KnowWhy Steel Stocks May Not Be Big Winners From Trump TariffsThese 5 Stocks Have Dipped Below Buy Points, But Don't Give Up On ThemThese 5 Hot Stocks Are Simmering Just Below Buy Points Nike, Oracle, Micron, Fed Rate Hike, Trump Tariffs: Investing Action Plan

6,HOG,"Harley-Davidson (HOG) warned on Monday that European Union retaliation for Trump tariffs on steel and aluminum will cost it close to $100 million a year, forcing the company to shift some production out of the U.S.XMoving production overseas ""is not the company's preference, but represents the only sustainable option to make its motorcycles accessible to customers in the EU and maintain a viable business in Europe,"" Harley said in a Monday filing.The disclosure reveals the mounting cost of the President Trump's confrontational trade policy and, in particular, his controversial decision to justify Trump tariffs on U.S. allies based on national security grounds.Harley stock plunged 6% to 41.57 on the stock market today, as trade concerns had the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq 100 tumbling. Harley fell 2.2% on Friday as EU tariffs against Harley took effect.The EU, like Canada, Mexico and China all are aiming retaliatory tariffs at targets aimed to weaken Trump and the GOP in key political battlegrounds. Trump has already shown he is sensitive to tariffs aimed at American farmers, nearly reaching a trade deal with Beijing that would have boosted Chinese imports of U.S. agricultural goods, instead of putting billions of dollars in sales at risk. While such a deal might still happen, trade tensions with China are likely to intensify this week as the U.S. gets set to announce investment restrictions meant to keep key technology out of Beijing's hands.Meanwhile, Trump is threatening to slap 20% tariffs on U.S. auto imports from Germany and the rest of Europe, which would dramatically escalate the conflict.Harley said in a Monday filing that EU tariffs on its motorcycles built in the U.S. just jumped from 6% to 31%, adding roughly $2,200 to the cost of each. To avoid harming dealers and undermining its business, Harley said it will swallow the cost.""To address the substantial cost of this tariff burden long-term, Harley-Davidson will be implementing a plan to shift production of motorcycles for EU destinations from the U.S. to its international facilities to avoid the tariff burden.""The company noted that ramping up production in international plants will require incremental investment and take nine to 18 months.The EU is Harley's most important market outside of the U.S., accounting for 40,000 sales in 2017. The company didn't note how U.S. workers would be affected but plans to detail financial implications as well as ways to mitigate the impact of retaliatory EU tariffs during the company's second-quarter earnings conference call on July 24.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE:Dow Jones Futures Fall As U.S. Plans China Tech Curbs: These 5 Top Stocks Are Near Buy PointsIf You Want To Buy More Apple Or Nvidia Shares, Read ThisThree Hot IPOs Flash Sell Signals; China Plays Keep TumblingStock Market Today: Track Market Trends And The Best Stocks To Watch

7,HOG,"Recent days in the global Trump trade war have seen President Donald Trump go to bat to save Chinese tech jobs, while Harley-Davidson (HOG) shifts some production out of the U.S.The cognitive dissonance doesn't end there. Trump has lashed out at Canada for its high tariffs on dairy products. That's despite American dairy farmers pleading with Trump to lift steel tariffs on Mexico, or else Mexicans will cut U.S. cheese out of their diets. Daimler (DDAIF) warned that Chinese tariffs will sap demand for its Alabama-made SUVs, while Trump threatened to hit imported German luxury cars with a 20% tax.The Trump trade war is full of contradictions that are partly a function of fighting on so many fronts. The end result looks likely to undermine U.S. interests, U.S. companies and U.S. jobs, while playing into the hands of America's top trade adversary: China.Trump wants to bend the rules of trade to get foreign manufacturers to produce goods for Americans in the U.S., attacking American companies for deciding to set up shop overseas to meet local demand. Yet Trump is shooting himself in the foot. Retaliatory tariffs by U.S. trading partners and Trump's own tariffs on steel and aluminum are raising the cost of doing business here.Trump accused Harley-Davidson of waving the ""white flag"" after the motorcycle maker said Europe's extra 25% tariff on American-made Harleys — in retaliation for Trump's tariffs — would add about $2,200 to the cost of each motorcycle.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseTrump argued that U.S. companies that stay strong will be rewarded when trading partners like the EU scrap their tariffs, including a 6% duty on Harleys. But companies have no reason to think Trump's strategy will work. While German carmakers are willing to give up a 10% tariff on imports, they're demanding that Trump cancel a decades-old 25% U.S. tax on imported SUVs and pickup trucks.Even when the U.S. could take the principled high ground, Trump is alienating U.S. allies and acting as if economic might makes right.Trump wasn't wrong in calling out Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on the country's dairy tariffs of 270%, yet the U.S. has its own sacred cows, so to speak. Overall, Canada has among the lowest tariffs in the world, even slightly lower than the U.S., according to the World Bank.Meanwhile, Trump's steel tariffs on Canada are so out of bounds that even the United Steelworkers union has called for Trump to drop the tariffs. Canada is the biggest steel exporter to the U.S., shipping 5.8 million metric tons in 2017. Yet, it's also the largest export market for U.S. steelmakers, importing 4.8 million metric tons. Trump tariffs ignore the latter.Harley-Davidson is hardly the only U.S. company mulling layoffs as collateral damage from the Trump trade war. Mid-Continent Nail of Missouri has reportedly laid off 60 workers and could cut hundreds more if it can't get an exemption from Trump steel tariffs that make its wares uncompetitive.Some 20,000 companies have sought exclusions. But Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said last week that fewer than 100 had been processed, with 42 accepted and 56 denied. Sixteen jobs could be lost for every steel and aluminum job added thanks to tariffs, a study by the Trade Partnerships Worldwide consultancy estimated.The latest survey of regional manufacturers by the Kansas City Fed found plenty of criticism of the Trump trade war. Statements from business owners included this: ""Bracing for the worst concerning China tariffs. We will move the last of manufacturing offshore. Loss of business due to tariffs will have a larger impact than interest rates.""Trump's tariffs on Chinese high-tech-related imports, due to take effect starting July 6, would make U.S. multinationals less competitive.How? Rather than target mostly finished goods that U.S. consumers buy from Chinese companies, the Trump tariffs hit so-called intermediate goods. U.S. companies import them from China to incorporate in finished U.S. products, which then become pricier vs. rivals.""That the tariffs fail to hurt Chinese firms directly should not be a surprise,"" wrote Peterson Institute researchers Mary Lovely and Yang Liang.President Xi Jinping's Made In China 2025 agenda aims to close the technological gap and end the dependence on advanced tech from non-Chinese companies. But that's an aspiration, the researchers noted, while current Chinese tech still lags that of the U.S. and others.""It is impossible to hit tomorrow's exports with today's tariffs.""The Semiconductor Industry Association says much the same thing: ""The proposed imposition of tariffs on semiconductors from China, most of which are actually researched, designed, and manufactured in the U.S., is counterproductive and fails to address the serious IP and industrial policy issues in China.""The chief Trump trade war target is China, which has a $375 billion trade surplus with the U.S., limits market access and systematically conspires to gain access to the intellectual property of U.S. firms.The U.S. could try to isolate Beijing by creating a broad united front to keep China honest or make it pay a price. This is what President Obama had in mind with the Trans-Pacific Partnership.But four days into his term, Trump scrapped that 12-nation trade deal, which included intellectual property protections. This spring he briefly toyed with rejoining the TPP.Instead of major U.S. trading partners uniting against China, the U.S. is drawing fire from all sides for Trump tariffs. China is widely seen as the prime culprit in global steel overcapacity that is at the root of Trump's 25% steel tariff. Yet China has been a minor steel exporter to the U.S., so Trump has picked a fight with Japan, the EU, Mexico and Canada.If the biggest trade threat to the U.S. is China and its world-dominating tech ambitions, why is Trump out to save 70,000 jobs at Chinese communications equipment firm ZTE?Trump decided last month to overturn Commerce Department sanctions against ZTE that banned key U.S. component suppliers from doing business with the firm, forcing it to cease operations.This week, Trump dropped a plan for emergency investment and export rules, including a 25% limit on Chinese ownership in firms buying key technology. Instead, Trump backed legislation in Congress to strengthen the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS.Trump could have gone as far as banning chip equipment sales to Chinese firms, Moody's said this week. That would have been a bitter pill for Xi and could have derailed trade talks.Trump appears to view America's big trade deficit as low-hanging fruit for an easy trade-war win. He largely declared victory a month ago, when China agreed to boost U.S. purchases by $70 billion. Trump touted the emerging deal as a big win for American farmers. The loser wouldn't be China, but other countries that supply it.That may explain why the Trump trade war appears to be more diplomatic with China than with traditional U.S. allies.With no allies to join in pressuring China to change its state-subsidized technology strategy, Trump seems to be settling for low-hanging fruit. He appears to be taking a softer line on export controls, pushing the seemingly inevitable technological cold war with China down the road.Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:Don't Panic: Here's Why Trump's China Trade War Won't HappenDow Jones Futures Try To Rally: This Key Tech Sector Flashes Big WarningIf You Want To Buy More Apple Or Nvidia Shares, Read ThisStock Market Today: Track Market Trends And The Best Stocks To Watch

8,HOG,"U.S. President Donald Trump accused Harley-Davidson (HOG) of using new tariffs on trade as cover for an existing plan to shift some production abroad and threatened the motorcycle manufacturer with a ""big tax"" on bikes imported to the U.S. if it relocates some plants overseas.X""A Harley-Davidson should never be built in another country — never!"" Trump tweeted Tuesday. ""Their employees and customers are already very angry at them. If they move, watch, it will be the beginning of the end — they surrendered, they quit! The Aura will be gone and they will be taxed like never before!""The company said in a government filing Monday that it may move some production outside the U.S. in response to European retaliation for the president's tariffs on imported metals.But Trump took issue with that in a series of early-morning tweets Tuesday.""Early this year Harley-Davidson said they would move much of their plant operations in Kansas City to Thailand. That was long before Tariffs were announced. Hence, they were just using Tariffs/Trade War as an excuse. Shows how unbalanced & unfair trade is, but we will fix it,"" Trump said.The president followed up by warning the company that goods produced overseas and imported back into the U.S. could be taxed. ""Harley must know that they won't be able to sell back into U.S. without paying a big tax!"" Trump said on Twitter.A Harley-Davidson should never be built in another country-never! Their employees and customers are already very angry at them. If they move, watch, it will be the beginning of the end — they surrendered, they quit! The Aura will be gone and they will be taxed like never before!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 26, 2018Chief Executive Officer Matt Levatich said in April that the factory in Thailand was a ""Plan B"" that Harley employed after the U.S. abandoned the 11-country Trans-Pacific Partnership free-trade agreement Trump withdrew from last year. He'd said they didn't relish the investment, which he also said was needed to maintain access to a key market.The early-morning missive from the president marked the second consecutive day Trump took aim at the iconic motorcycle maker, after the company said in an SEC filing on Monday that tariffs enacted by the European Union in response to Trump's penalties on imported steel and aluminum would add as much as $100 million a year to its costs.""To address the substantial cost of this tariff burden long-term, Harley-Davidson will be implementing a plan to shift production of motorcycles for EU destinations from the U.S. to its international facilities to avoid the tariff burden,"" the company said.Harley shares fell 1.3% in early trading Tuesday in New York after tumbling 6% Monday, the biggest drop in almost five months. The stock is down 18% this year.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseOn Monday, Trump said he was surprised the motorcycle manufacturer ""would be the first to wave the White Flag.""""I fought hard for them and ultimately they will not pay tariffs selling into the EU, which has hurt us badly on trade, down $151 Billion,"" Trump continued. ""Taxes just a Harley excuse — be patient!""In a subsequent tweet, Trump said the U.S. is managing to get other countries to lower existing tariffs and barriers that he said have been in place for years through bad deals. ""We are opening up closed markets and expanding our footprint. They must play fair or they will pay tariffs!"" he said in the post.White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders downplayed the announcement earlier Monday, saying Trump's ""trade and economic policies have been a huge benefit to the American economy.""""The European Union is attempting to punish U.S. workers with unfair and discriminatory trade policies, and President Trump will continue to push for free, fair and reciprocal trade in hopes that the EU will join us in that,"" Sanders told reporters at the White House.Tariffs have also forced the hand of the maker of another iconic American brand, Jack Daniel's.Brown-Forman (BFB), which also produces Woodford Reserve and other bourbons, will have to raise prices for its whiskey sold in the European Union following the implementation of a 25% tariff, according to spokesman Phil Lynch. The higher prices, which he said would primarily affect Jack Daniel's, would amount to about a 10% increase for consumers.Lynch did not say what effect the expected price increases would have on European sales, noting that ""we continue to invest behind the growth of American whiskey in the EU.""Brown-Forman fell to its lowest level in almost seven months on Monday.The EU's levies are only the latest blowback Harley has faced from Trump's trade policies. A year after Trump pulled the U.S. out of a 12-nation trade deal, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, in January 2017, Harley announced it would close its factory in Kansas City, Missouri, and consolidate production in York, Pennsylvania, eliminating about 260 jobs.Trump hosted Levatich and other Harley executives and union leaders for a White House listening session in February 2017 and hailed the motorcycle manufacturer as ""a true American icon"" and ""one of the greats.""""Thank you, Harley-Davidson, for building things in America,"" Trump said at the time. ""I think you're going to even expand. I know your business is now doing very well and there's a lot of spirit right now in the country that you weren't having so much in the last number of months that you have right now.""Harley-Davidson's headquarters are in Milwaukee, and on Monday the office of House Speaker Paul Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican who has opposed Trump's move to impose tariffs, said the company's announcement was evidence of the detrimental effect of the president's trade policy.""This is further proof of the harm from unilateral tariffs,"" AshLee Strong, a Ryan spokeswoman, said Monday. ""The best way to help American workers, consumers, and manufacturers is to open new markets for them, not to raise barriers to our own market.""Lawmakers weighed in Tuesday on Trump's latest tweets.""What I'm worried about is that it's just the first of many that we are going to see as a result of tariffs,"" Senator Doug Jones, a Democrat from Alabama, told CNN in an interview to discuss Harley's announcement that it would move some production abroad.""I don't know all the details but from what I saw was it would be a $2,200 increase on the final price per bike with these tariffs,"" Congressman Adam Kinzinger, Republican of Illinois, told CNN in a separate interview. ""That's going to impact sales.""""I don't have a problem with the president taking on China,"" Kinzinger added.

10,HOG,"President Donald Trump reversed course again on Thursday and now plans to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from the European Union, Canada and Mexico. This Trump trade war threat, which tanked the stock market in late February and early March, pressured the Dow Jones Thursday.The Dow Jones industrial average fell 1% on the stock market today, finding support so far at its 50-day moving average. The S&P 500 slipped 0.7%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite dipped 0.3%. Stocks accelerated losses as Canada joined the European Union and Mexico in retaliating.Steel and aluminum stocks surged initially, but pared gains. U.S. Steel (X) rose 1.7%. Steel Dynamics (STLD) reversed to trade down 0.9%. Aluminum giant Alcoa (AA) reversed to fall 1%. Century Aluminum (CENX) climbed 3.3%.Dow Jones components Boeing (BA) and Caterpillar (CAT), heavy steel users vulnerable in a trade war, fell 1.7% and 2.3%.Harley Davidson (HOG), whose motorcycles could be hit by EU retaliatory tariffs, lost 2.1%.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe EU said it would impose 25% tariffs on $3.3 billion worth of U.S. imports starting June 20. Mexico also announced plans to strike back by imposing tariffs on pork bellies, apples, grapes, cheeses and flat steel. Canada announced retaliatory tariffs on U.S. steel, aluminum and a variety of other products.The Trump administration faced a decision with previously granted exemptions from the tariffs of 25% on steel imports and 10% on aluminum imports expiring June 1. Even though the exemptions have covered more than half of steel imports, steel prices have moved higher this year. U.S. prices for steel are already about 50% higher than those in Europe and China, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce said in a statement opposing any expansion of tariffs or quotas.""Such a move would hit American manufacturers with higher costs, slow the growth of the U.S. construction sector, and put the brakes on job creation in both of these key industries,"" the Chamber said.Hitting Canada and Mexico with the tariffs could be a huge blow to Nafta talks. There's little logic in imposing tariffs on metal imports from the Nafta partners. Canada is the biggest steel exporter to the U.S., shipping 5.8 million metric tons in 2017, or about 16% of total steel imports. Yet Canada is also, far and away, the largest export market for U.S. steel makers, so its retaliatory tariffs will hurt. Through the first three quarters of 2017, the U.S. ran a relatively minor trade deficit with Canada of about a half-million metric tons, according to Department of Commerce data.Trump's move to broaden tariffs on metal imports follows news earlier this week that the Trump administration is preparing to hit China with tariffs on $50 billion worth of mainly high-tech imports as initially planned. That came as a surprise after China-U.S. trade talks appeared close to a deal for China to significantly increase purchases of U.S. energy and agricultural goods.Last week, Trump ordered the Commerce Department to conduct a national security investigation into foreign auto imports. He's said to be considering 25% tariffs on $176 billion yearly imports. News reports say that Trump is determined to keep German luxury cars out of the U.S.For the past couple of months, it has looked like a trade war might be avoided, Greg Valliere, chief global strategist at Horizon Investments, wrote in a note distributed early Thursday morning. But he said he was ready to throw in the towel on that assessment. ""Barring a last-minute breakthrough, a trade war with some of America's closest allies will begin tomorrow.""""The incoherent Washington stance on trade is a daily roller-coaster ride, fueled by bitter infighting between President Trump's fierce trade protectionists and his more moderate advisors,"" Valliere wrote.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:This Hot Biotech Dives On FDA Hold; FANG Stock Enters 'Friend Zone'Four Stocks Pop Up On The IBD 50 List, Including Five BelowDow Jones Stocks Apple, Microsoft, Intel, Nike, Visa Are In Buy RangeForget Trump: Why We're Headed For A Long, Cold U.S. And China Trade WarStock Market Today: Track Market Trends And The Best Stocks To Watch

The duty comes just after government data showed that the American hog herd on March 1 reached a seasonal all-time high. The tax may cause U.S. meat supplies to ""back up meaningfully"" and cause prices to fall, dragging on chicken and beef, Tim Ramey, an analyst at Pivotal Research Group, said Monday in a report.

14,HOG,"The Dow Jones, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite retreated in a volatile market as Trump trade war fears waxed and waned, with Nike (NKE) and bank stocks fueling a Friday rebound. Crude oil prices hit multiyear highs. General Electric (GE), kicked out of the Dow Jones, announced a partial breakup. Amazon.com (AMZN) moves disrupted the pharmacy and shipping industries. Harley-Davidson (HOG) said it would shift some production to Europe due to tariffs, angering President Donald Trump.The Dow Jones, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite sold off on Monday and Wednesday, breaking or testing key support levels, amid concerns about Trump trade war moves against China investment. All three fell for the week, even with gains on Thursday and Friday. So far in 2018, the Dow Jones is down 1.8%, while the S&P 500 has gained 1.7% and the Nasdaq 8.8%. The Treasury yield curve continued to flatten, signaling concerns about Fed rate hikes down the road. Bank stocks, under pressure for weeks on the flattening yield curve, rebounded Friday after the Fed cleared most to raise dividends and buybacks. Energy stocks rallied as crude prices soared. GE popped on its restructuring plan. Nike sprinted on a U.S. sales revival and a big stock buyback.Oil futures jumped more than 8% to $74.15 a barrel to their highest levels since 2014 over supply issues from North America and Iran. The Trump Administration warned allies that they needed to stop importing Iranian crude by November, according to reports. Meanwhile, a key oil-sands facility in Canada will be shut down until August.

Domestic production was flat last week at 10.9 million barrels per day.General Electric (GE) ended a century-plus run on the Dow Jones industrial average and said it plans to shrink even further. The industrial giant, seeking to pare debt and simplify, will spin off GE Healthcare and divest its majority stake in oilfield services company Baker Hughes (BHGE). After prior, smaller divestitures, GE will now focus on aviation, power and renewable energy. The decisions followed a year-long ""deep dive"" by new CEO John Flannery, a period over which GE stock crumbled in half.

Shares of Nike leapt 11% Friday, hitting a new high.Harley-Davidson faced a double-whammy in the past week, first getting hit with a 25% tariff from the European Union, then getting slammed by President Trump for waving the ""white flag."" The iconic motorcycle maker said the EU tax — retaliation for Trump's steel and aluminum tariffs — would cost it roughly $100 million a year. After announcing a plan to shift production for Europe overseas to avoid the hit, Harley took fire from Trump's tweets. Analysts see some risk that Harley-Davidson could suffer a long-term reputation hit. Harley stock retreated.Amazon turned to small fry to disrupt two major industries on Thursday. Its deal to buy online pharmacy PillPack, with $100 million in 2017 revenue, gave Amazon just a toehold in a $300 billion industry. But it roiled many health care stocks. New Dow Jones stock Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) tumbled 9.9% on Thursday. CVS Health (CVS), which is buying insurer Aetna (AET) partly in anticipation of Amazon entering the pharmacy space, fell 6.1%. Drug distributor McKesson (MCK) fell 6.1%. Amazon also said it would help entrepreneurs launch local businesses delivering Amazon packages with fleets of up 40 vehicles. That plan helped send shares of UPS down 2.3% and FedEx 1.3% on Thursday.The Federal Reserve released the second and final round of its annual stress tests, clearing most shareholder payout plans for the nation's largest financial firms. Wells Fargo (WFC) rallied Friday on its buyback and dividend plan. But JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and many other bank stocks slashed gains or closed lower. But the Fed restricted the payout plans of Morgan Stanley (MS) and Goldman Sachs (GS) and failed the U.S. division of the embattled Deutsche Bank (DB). The Fed said Morgan and Goldman would ""maintain their capital distributions at the levels they paid in recent years"" after their capital ratios fell below the Fed's minimum — the result of a one-time reduction due to tax reform. Goldman and Morgan came close to missing the Fed's minimum on a key leverage ratio in the first round of the tests.This past week 11 IPOs raised about $2.8 billion. Several IPOs showed double-digit gains on the first day of trading. Among biotech new issues, Neuronetics (STIM) rallied 63% in its debut and Tricida (TCDA) rose 37%.

Shares of Constellation tumbled Friday.Sonic earnings rose 21% to 52 cents a share, better than consensus for 49 cents EPS, but sales slid more than expected, declining nearly 5% to $118 million vs. analyst views for $120 million in revenue.

16,HOG,"The best growth stock mutual funds rewarded investors with returns between 26% and 46% in 2017, handsomely beating the S&P 500's advance of 21.83%. This strong performance partly explains why 113 funds landed an IBD Best Mutual Funds 2018 Award in the growth category vs. just nine the prior year.By comparison, no value stock funds made the winners' list this year, and the number of award-winning blend funds that have both growth and value components got cut in half to just 11.One year's outperformance is not all that's needed to win a Best Mutual Funds Award. Mutual funds need at least $100 million in assets and must beat their benchmark for the past one, three, five and 10 years ended December 2017, showing they can do well as stock market trends and conditions evolve over the long haul.So, what exactly contributed to these results and what's in store for the rest of 2018?Among the top five award winning growth funds, Primecap Odyssey Aggressive Growth (POAGX) tops the list with one- and 10-year average returns of 33.59% and 15.06%, respectively. The S&P 500 returned an average annual 8.5% in the past 10 years. The $11 billion fund invests in stocks across all sectors and market caps, targeting companies with prospects of rapid earnings growth that may not be reflected in their stock prices.At the end of 2017, the fund held 22% in small and micro caps — a significant overweight vs. the index's 1%. It also had major overweights in health care and technology — both sectors that were strong performers. Managers are not afraid to make strong sector or stock bets if they see solid long-term potential.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

Rowe Price New Horizons (PRNHX) came in second, with returns of 31.49% for one year and an average annual 13.16% for 10 years. Midcaps and small caps comprise 69% and 25% of the $23 billion fund. Manager Henry Ellenbogen seeks out small companies that can become much larger. This usually includes disrupters and companies that promise durable growth.""Market leadership is likely to narrow as the bull market ages. As always, unforeseen risks, such as geopolitical turmoil, also pose challenges,"" Ellenbogen said in an email. ""Global macroeconomic events, including commodity price volatility, could affect performance."" He also pointed out that a regulatory attack on leading technology and internet companies is possible, which could have unintended consequences and heighten inflationary concerns.""As such, we will closely monitor global economic and political conditions and be cautious around new bouts of risk taking,"" Ellenbogen added. ""Nevertheless, we remain confident in our ability to find and hold smaller companies that can compound wealth by becoming durable and sustainable businesses, even through the downturns and valuation adjustments that are part of every market cycle.""American Century Select (TWCIX) surged 28.93% last year and an average annual 8.62% for the past 10 years. Veteran manager Keith Lee and his team run the $3 billion large-cap growth fund by selecting high-quality companies with strong growth prospects, while also limiting risk. As a result, the fund sports a turnover of just 19%.""We're looking for very long-term, durable franchises that have sustainable growth over long periods of time, and that allows us to really limit the amount of turnover we have,"" said co-portfolio manager Chris Krantz. Traits of such companies include strong management teams, strong competitive positions, good returns on capital and the ability to achieve a higher return on capital over time, he added.In addition, the fund is valuation-sensitive, so it looks to buy stocks that are reasonably priced. Top 10 holdings represent 43% of the fund and comprise leading stocks such as Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL), Mastercard (MA), Facebook (FB) and Amazon (AMZN).Last year, the fund benefited from consumer staples companies that have ""stronger-growing franchises that weren't as impacted by consumer preferences,"" said Krantz.Beauty product maker Estee Lauder (EL) was a strong contributor with a 68% jump in share price. ""They have wonderful brands, a great management team and the ability to continue to grow. A lot of consumer staples companies are struggling to sustainably grow,"" Krantz said.Costco (COST), which rose 22% in 2017, ""is another company that while there are some concerns out there about online competition to Costco, Costco is a value proposition to the consumer, because the prices they offer is a competitive advantage that we think will be enduring. They provide value to the consumer that you just can't find anywhere else,"" explained Krantz.With consumers spending more money online, global electronic payment firms such as Mastercard and PayPal (PYPL) have a ""great business model that has high margins, high returns on capital and as consumers change their shopping preferences, whether by channel or by category, they're still spending with the same means. That's a secular growth area,"" he said.Blend funds are part of the mutual fund style box and combine growth and value investing. This year's cream-of-the-crop blend funds include Carillon Scout Mid Cap I (UMBMX), sporting a one-year return of 24.02% and a 10-year average annual return of 11.13%, and Primecap Odyssey Stock (POSKX) with 25.96% and 10.3%, respectively.T. Rowe Price's Institutional U.S. Structured Research (TRISX) and Capital Opportunity (PRCOX) rose 24% last year and an average annual 9% the past 10 years.Manager Ann Holcomb says that both funds follow the exact same strategy through a team-managed style where each research analyst is responsible for making the buy and sell decision within their own area of expertise. About 30 analysts are responsible for their own slice of the portfolio, overseen by three managers who oversee the big picture and make sure the portfolio is constrained in terms of the level of active risk.Top holdings include Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Facebook and JPMorgan Chase (JPM). Last year, about two-thirds of the fund's outperformance came from stock selection, plus one-third from being underweight energy and telecom and overweight information technology.For 2018, Holcomb has ""cautious optimism for the rest of the year. Valuations are still pretty full, but fundamental underpinnings for earnings growth are still there. We have tax reform — it hasn't really made its way into earnings yet. We should still be the beneficiaries of further regulatory relief. Rates are still low, though rising. The consumer is healthy.

17,HOG,"Just how bad will the U.S.' slap-fight over trade, which escalated with China on Friday, be for S&P 500 earnings and stocks? Just how much can the U.S. economy, which delivered solid June jobs growth on Friday, still grow after a nine-year expansion?Analysts expect another blowout quarter in Q2 — 20.7% earnings-per-share growth for S&P 500 index components and an 8.1% jump in revenue, according to Thomson Reuters. Wall Street is betting on continued scorching results for the rest of the year. But they may not be as scorching if President Donald Trump's trade wars with China, Canada, Mexico, Europe and others become more heated. The quiet earnings growth next year might be even more muted.Analysts say the effects of a trade war have yet to be priced into financial forecasts.""I think the first tangible impact should start showing up in estimate revisions as these earnings results come out,"" said Sheraz Mian, director of research at Zacks.In other words, the second-quarter earnings season could offer some higher drama than CEOs' usual blanched remarks about ""headwinds"" and ""tailwinds."" Investors, even more than usual, will focus on earnings guidance and post-earnings call commentary to get some answers as to how the tariffs will affect profit, sales, prices, corporate strategy and shareholder returns.Higher costs for parts and supplies that U.S. companies bring in from overseas could mean higher costs for customers. Businesses could rethink or even uproot complex global supply chains. Higher prices on U.S.-made goods sold overseas could crimp international demand. Companies could cut or delay major investments.S&P 500 index companies, filled with hundreds of U.S. multinationals and exporters, are more exposed to tariffs and global demand than the U.S. economy itself.As for the second-quarter itself, the gains from S&P 500 companies come courtesy of President Trump's tax cuts and an enduring U.S. economy.Rebounding oil prices will lift the energy sector's Q2 earnings by around 141.5%, with sales up some 20%, according to Thomson. S&P 500 energy stocks, which include Dow Jones giants Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) as well as ConocoPhillips (COP), Valero (VLO), Marathon Oil (MRO), Schlumberger (SLB) and many others, have generally been strong performers.Analysts expect the S&P 500 financials to clock a 22% gain in earnings on a 4.5% bump in revenue, as JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and other banks enjoy lower taxes and deregulation. Thomson forecasts semiconductors and internet software and services to lead the S&P 500 tech components toward 25.5% earnings growth. Tech revenue is seen jumping 12%. Apple (AAPL), Intel (INTC), Amazon.com (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Facebook (FB) are all slated to deliver solid-to-stellar growth.As estimates stand now, Thomson Reuters is forecasting the 20%-plus earnings growth to reach into the third and fourth quarters.""The last time we had earnings growth in Q3 and Q4 like this was in 2010,"" Tajinder Dhillon, senior research analyst at Thomson Reuters, said in an email.However, looking past 2018, analysts appear to have a harder time justifying bullish expectations for S&P 500 companies.""You look at the numbers going forward, you really don't start to see a significant drop in growth until you get into 2019, when again, you'll be back to apples-to-apples on the tax rates,"" said John Butters, senior earnings analyst at FactSet.But tougher comparisons aren't a massive concern right now, analysts say. And next year's growth still looks solid. Dhillon said that for 2019 investors can expect a 9.7% earnings growth rate, ""which is still higher than the 20-year average of 7.3%.""Wall Street also worries that the U.S. economy has fewer tools at its disposal to keep its marathon run going. The dollar is stronger. The yield curve is flatter due partly to the Federal Reserve's decisions to lift short-term interest rates.The narrowing yield curve, the gap between rates on short-term and long-term government debt, looms large for banks in particular. The flatter curve, also seen as a precursor to an economic downturn, has dragged bank stocks lower in recent months.Banks also lend money to borrowers based on long-term rates, but borrow from depositors according to short-term rates. The narrower the difference between the two, the narrower the banks' net interest margins. JPMorgan, Citigroup (C) and Wells Fargo (WFC) report second-quarter earnings on Friday.The three banking giants, which all announced hefty shareholder-return packages last month, are expected to deliver solid EPS growth. But JPMorgan stock, along with that of Citigroup, Wells Fargo and others, is near 2018 lows.When the Fed raises rates that affects the money flowing into global, emerging markets as well.""If U.S. interest rates are going up,"" Mian said, ""and an investor or a class of investors is scouring world markets for yield and returns, and if the yield and return is going up in a developed market like the U.S., then there's no reason to take the extra risk of going to Argentina or Turkey when you can get it in the U.S.""The U.S. on Friday lobbed tariffs at $34 billion worth of Chinese products — more than 800 types of products total. That's the first part of a $50 billion response for what Trump says are China's trade abuses against the U.S.The U.S. tariffs target aircraft parts, industrial parts and equipment, some vehicles and other machinery. The duties from the U.S. targeted products related to China's tech-focused ""Made in China 2025"" plan. Trump has said that initiative would ""hurt economic growth for the United States and many other countries.""""The United States can no longer tolerate losing our technology and intellectual property through unfair economic practices,"" Trump said in a statement last month.China on Friday responded with penalties of its own on U.S. products, including automakers and agriculture. China aimed those tariffs squarely at Trump's base.Trump has threatened to levy another $200 billion in tariffs on China, and even more. Meanwhile, Trump has threatened to impose a global import tariff on autos. That follows duties on steel and aluminum that have spurred Europe, Canada and Mexico to retaliate.Further trade discord could force companies to rethink their supply chains. Those adjustments could undo corporate America's efforts over the past two decades to more efficiently manage their inventories. Such practices over that time firmed up businesses' balance sheets.The brinkmanship has swept up some of the most iconic American businesses along the way. General Motors (GM) said as much last week, warning that more tariffs would lead to ""reduced presence at home and abroad for this iconic American company.""Harley-Davidson (HOG) said it would offer more detail, on its earnings call this month, about its plans to move some production out of the U.S. to skirt tariffs from the EU. Brown-Forman (BFB) is raising the price of Jack Daniel's in parts of Europe because of the tariffs imposed by the EU.No one knows how the Trump trade wars, and their impact on S&P 500 companies, will play out.""We expect company-specific risks from tariffs and China-trade exposures to be a central discussion topic during 2Q18 earnings calls,"" RBC analyst Deane Dray, who covers industrials vulnerable to steel and aluminum tariffs, wrote in a note last month. ""But no one has a crystal ball on how the tariff situation will ultimately play out, especially the potential knock-on effects.""He said companies like 3M (MMM) and Danaher (DHR) looked best equipped among industrials to handle the trade disputes.The trade war also threatens chipmakers like Micron (MU). A Chinese court blocked sales of some of its chips in the country, a move seen as pushback from the nation against Trump's trade salvos. China has held up approving the Qualcomm (QCOM) takeover of NXP Semiconductors (NXPI). Boeing (BA) isn't subject to China tariffs, but Beijing could favor Airbus (EADSY) jets in a protracted U.S.-China trade war. The aerospace company in April downplayed worries over a trade war.Baird analyst Benjamin Hartford covers transportation and logistics companies like UPS (UPS), FedEx (FDX) and Expeditors International (EXPD). Hartford wrote in a research note last month that he'd seen no ""material evidence (yet) of freight volume weakness amid rising global trade tensions.""Some analysts, like Tigress' Ivan Feinseth, expressed optimism that strength in corporate earnings would offset any trade damage. Others wonder how much a trade war will hurt corporate travel for the likes of global carriers like American Airlines (AAL) and Delta Air Lines (DAL), and cargo demand broadly. Delta Air earnings are due Thursday.""We still expect demand to grow, but those expectations are dampened with each new tariff introduced,"" Alexandre de Juniac, CEO of the International Air Transport Association, said of air cargo demand in a statement this week.

18,HOG,"Shares of Harley-Davidson (HOG) skidded close to a two-year low on Tuesday after it warned of a potentially significant hit to sales if it gets caught in the middle of a trade war.X European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker named Harley-Davidson motorcycles as a likely target for retaliation by the European Union if President Trump follows through on his plan to impose tariffs of 25% on U.S. steel imports and 10% on aluminum.On the stock market today, Harley shares closed down 2% but had come off session lows.Harley is hardly the only company in the line of fire. Like Harley, Boeing (BA) stands to face both higher metals costs due to Trump tariffs and, of greater concern, potential harm on the sales front if governments take out their frustrations with Trump on Boeing.Boeing shares slipped 1.1% on Tuesday, while European rival Airbus (EADSY) rose 0.9%.Meanwhile, steel stocks bounced back after a bout of selling early Tuesday to turn in mixed results. U.S. Steel (X) was off 0.5% and Steel Dynamics (STLD) 0.7%, Nucor (NUE) 0.1% while AK Steel (AKS) rose 0.7%.Financial markets appear to be in a holding pattern as investors try to figure out what Trump will do.Harley-Davidson is seen as an especially juicy target for reprisals because it has a factory in House Speaker Paul Ryan's Wisconsin district, though the EU had the motorcycle maker in its sights back in 2003, before President George W. Bush lifted steel tariffs after 18 months to avert trade repercussions. Ryan hardly had an international profile back then.IBD'S TAKE: The sell-off triggered by President Trump's tariff plan has changed the outlook for the stock market, The Big Picture column explained on Thursday. Now that stock market volatility has returned, it's more important than ever to read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines. There's some logic in ramping up the pressure on Ryan. The pro-trade Republican already has come out against the Trump tariffs, and GOP members of Congress are quietly discussing what they might do to block Trump if he proceeds. Realistically, mustering a veto-proof majority to stop Trump might be impossible. But U.S. trade partners may want to drive a wedge between Trump and Congress so that he has less political capital to strike back once they retaliate.Europe accounts for about 16% of Harley sales, but the EU may not be the only country looking at the Milwaukee-based company as a potent target. Canadian trade experts also are discussing a likelihood that Ottawa would target Harley-Davidson if Trump won't exempt its Nafta partner from steel tariffs.Canada is the biggest exporter of steel to the U.S., yet it's also easily the biggest importer of steel from the U.S. Trump has tweeted that  Mexico and Canada can escape his tariffs only if they sign on to a ""new & fair Nafta agreement,"" but talks on revamping the deal haven't progressed very far.Canada makes up about 5% of Harley-Davidson's sales, while Mexico accounts for a smaller fraction. Mexico also is reportedly looking for politically sensitive ways to undercut support for Trump's tariffs, and it would be no surprise if it looks to Milwaukee.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:These 5 Top Financial Stocks Just Carved This 'Super-Growth' PatternWhy Air Force Is Rushing To Fly A Sixth-Generation Fighter JetTrump Tariffs: These Stocks Could Be Hurt The MostFed Inflation Gauge Stays Tame, But Here's 6 Reasons Why Investors Are NervousAmazon Vs.

19,HOG,"President Trump is preparing to unveil a plan to hit China with at least $30 billion worth of tariffs, and possibly twice that amount, as soon as Thursday.News reports say the announcement could be delayed and that the tariffs won't take effect immediately, largely because the White House is still settling on its approach.Yet the news leaves little doubt that Trump is preparing to make China the central front in his trade war to punish intellectual-property infringement by Chinese companies, abetted by strong-arm tactics from Beijing.By comparison Trump's steel and aluminum tariffs that sent financial markets into a tizzy last month were relatively minor — amounting to $9 billion a year, even before he  started handing out exemptions to Mexico, Canada and potentially other trading partners.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseAs Trump prepares to direct relatively heavy economic fire toward China, trade groups representing Walmart (WMT), Apple (AAPL), Best Buy (BBY) and other retailers warned that tariffs would raise prices for American consumers, whether or not tariffs prove effective in shrinking the trade deficit. Under Armour (UAA), Nike (NKE) and other shoe companies echoed similar concerns.Trump's economic advisors are reportedly focused on taxing U.S. imports that are key to Beijing's Made in China 2025 initiative aimed at achieving global technology leadership.Yet, in some respects, taking on China in this way makes more sense than via steel and aluminum tariffs. While China is the biggest source of global steel overcapacity, it represents only about 2% of U.S. steel imports.Even though candidate Trump often directed nearly as harsh rhetoric at Mexico, the White House clearly doesn't want to fight a two-front trade war at this juncture. The Trump administration gave Mexico and Canada indefinite exemptions from the steel and aluminum tariffs while the countries renegotiate Nafta, despite halting progress in the talks to date. Mexico and Canada are both big importers of U.S. steel as well amid the fluid North America supply chains. So hitting them with steel tariffs makes little sense.Still, it's looking likely that Trump will be engaging in trade-related skirmishes — and U.S. companies will be at risk of collateral damage — on multiple fronts.On Wednesday, the European Union proposed a 3% tax on digital revenue, hitting U.S. tech giants such as Apple, Facebook (FB), Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) and Amazon (AMZN).The proposal to raise about $6 billion in tax revenue per year will need all 28 EU members for approval but could be adopted on a country-by-country basis. The idea precedes Trump's election and is justified based on the companies' low tax rates in the EU, yet the move could contribute to growing trade tensions between the U.S. and European allies.In preparation for Trump's steel and aluminum tariffs that are set to take effect on Friday if no exemption is granted, the EU has detailed a list of $3.4 billion worth of American products that could face retaliatory tariffs, including Harley-Davidson (HOG) motorcycles, Jack Daniels whiskey and Florida orange juice. European officials plan to challenge Trump's tariffs at the World Trade Organization and up the ante in retaliation if the ruling goes their way.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:'Vigilant' Fed Is About To Shift The Rate-Hike Goal PostsNo. 1-Ranked IPO Stock Breaks Out, Expects Big Q1 Earnings GrowthIs Amazon Just Toying With Idea Of Buying Toys R Us Retail Stores?These 5 Top Stocks Stood Out Monday

20,HOG,"President Trump said on Thursday that he'll sign a measure next week imposing tariffs of 25% on steel imports and 10% on aluminum imports. That gave steel and aluminum stocks a boost, but the S&P 500 index and other major averages retreated.X Despite reported divisions in the White House over the wisdom of major tariffs, which could spark retaliation by trading partners, Trump appeared determined to stick to his guns. The import tariffs — easily his most far-reaching protectionist trade measures — were recommended by the Commerce Department, which cited national security concerns to justify support of U.S. steel and aluminum producers with high tariffs on imports.The Dow Jones industrial average fell 1.7% on Trump comments, with the S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite off 1.3%. While steel and aluminum buyers, such as Ford (F) and General Motors (GM), stand to lose from such tariffs, the bigger risk to markets is that Trump's actions will bring retaliation from foreign trade partners.Ford and GM reported February U.S. auto sales Thursday morning that fell more than expected. Auto stocks accelerated losses on the Trump tariff news.Track Top Stocks And Market Trends With Free IBD NewslettersShares of U.S. Steel (X), Steel Dynamics (STLD), Nucor (NUE) and AK Steel (AKS) had surged in early action on the stock market today, but gave up some of their gains as expectations waned that Trump was set to follow-through on Commerce Department recommendations.Trumps comments did light a fire under the industrial metals producers again. U.S. Steel was up 5.76%, Steel Dynamics 4%, Nucor 3.3% and AK Steel 9.5%. They were off their session highs though. Alcoa (AA) edged up 0.2%.Trump tweeted early Thursday morning that ""our Steel and Aluminum industries (and many others) have been decimated by decades of unfair trade and bad policy.""Our Steel and Aluminum industries (and many others) have been decimated by decades of unfair trade and bad policy with countries from around the world. We must not let our country, companies and workers be taken advantage of any longer. We want free, fair and SMART TRADE!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 1, 2018 IBD'S TAKE: Stock market volatility has returned, so it's more important than ever to read The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines. Commerce recommended global tariffs of 24% on steel imports and 10% on aluminum, along with a range of other options aimed at bringing capacity utilization in the two domestic industries up to 80%.National security concerns haven't been used to justify the imposition of tariffs for decades. There's little reason to think that the action would comply with World Trade Organization rules, though that doesn't appear worry Trump.President George W. Bush backed down after imposing steel tariffs in 2002, just as European nations were getting ready to launch trade reprisals.Harley-Davidson (HOG) motorcycles, Jack Daniels whiskey, and soybeans are seen as potentially facing collateral damage in a trade war, but that may not be all.

Stock futures had slumped overnight and remained weak before earnings reports begin to hit the wire early Tuesday.There was also weak economic news out of the real estate sector, with the National Association of Home Builders reporting its builder confidence survey slumped to 64 in July, down from June's reading of 69 and the lowest tally since November.Netflix scored a gap-up breakout, despite reporting mixed second-quarter results late Monday. The company reported adding 5.2 million new subscribers during the quarter, far above consensus views for 3.2 million. When the stock opened, it was extended above a standard flat-base buy point of 166.97. But the wide gap-up move enabled a technical buy range beginning roughly at the stock's 176.12 opening price.

Fellow industrial conglomerate Honeywell International (HON) also beat on top and bottom lines, but guided full-year estimates slightly higher. Honeywell shares rose Friday, retaking a buy point.RELATED:General Electric Stock Dives On Earnings OutlookAmerican Express beat on the top and bottom lines, though provisions for losses jumped 26% due to loan-portfolio growth and a rise in the rate for lending write-offs.

The company also hiked its full-year revenue growth outlook above views. Visa and American Express, both Dow components, rose 2.8% and 0.4%, respectively, with both still in buy range.TD Ameritrade (AMTD) stock broke out from a long consolidation on July 18 as the online broker beat on both the top and bottom lines, even as industry trading fees for stocks and ETFs have plunged this year.

Weaker trading and net-interest income also hurt Bank of America (BAC), though Fed rate hikes have helped the bank and it said it expected net-interest income to rise in Q3. Morgan Stanley (MS) reported that trading revenue fell, but less so than rivals. JPMorgan (JPM) and Citigroup (C) have also signaled caution amid slow loan growth and longer-term bond yields, which can indicate flagging confidence over the chances for long-term economic gains. Morgan Stanley cleared a buy point while Goldman undercut its 50-day and 200-day moving averages.Check Point Software (CHKP) reported better-than-expected second-quarter earnings on Thursday, but gave weak guidance for the current Q3. Check Point tumbled 7.2% that day, falling below its 50-day moving average. Check Point on Wednesday briefly topped a buy point but closed below that trigger.

The Nasdaq composite backed out of thin early gains and slipped into negative trade.The weakening overnight of the Republican effort to overhaul the Affordable Care Act, and considering more strongly the option to simply repeal the ACA without any sort of replacement legislation, sent the U.S. Dollar Index to a 10-month low in very early trade Tuesday and weighed on early market action.Goldman Sachs (GS) and JPMorgan (JPM) posted the Dow's heaviest opening losses, down 0.9% and 0.8%, respectively. Goldman reported a strong earnings beat and a smaller-than-expected decrease in second-quarter revenue.

25,HOG,"President Donald Trump made punishing China for trade misdeeds official U.S. policy on Thursday, imposing tariffs of 25% on up to $60 billion of imports, with a focus on high-tech goods. While not as hostile as the $60 billion worth of tariffs floated in recent days, the move signals the beginning of a fractious era for China-U.S. economic relations as the two countries vie for technological supremacy.Trump said Thursday's tariffs were ""the first of many,"" while China's U.S. ambassador said Beijing is ""not afraid"" of a trade war.The tariffs would apply to ""appropriate products,"" said U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, as the U.S. strikes back at China's ""policy of forced technology transfer"" and cybertheft. Those products will reportedly include robots, aerospace, high-speed rail, biotech and other categories.Once the list of some 1,300 products is made official, U.S. companies will have a window to comment and potentially seek relief. Trump, who signed a ""memorandum targeting China's economic aggression,"" according to the White House, characterized the tariffs not as the start of a trade war, but part of ""a very large negotiation"" with Beijing.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseBut Trump said Thursday's action will be the ""first of many"" to tackle the ""out of control""  U.S.-China trade gap.China signaled it was ready for a trade war.""We don't want a trade war with the United States, or with anybody else. But we are not afraid of it. If somebody tries to impose a trade war on us, we will fight,"" Ambassador Cui Tiankai said in a video posted on the Chinese embassy's Facebook page. He said China ""would fight to the end..with all necessary measures.""But he added that China will continue to work to ""manage our possible differences in a constructive way."" He also said allegations that China is abetting intellectual property theft are ""groundless.""The Dow Jones industrial average, the S&P 500 index and the Nasdaq composite initially pared losses somewhat after the announcement, but sold off into the close, with all the major averages closing down at least 2.4%. The Dow tumbled 2.9%.Even as U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum imports start to kick in on Friday, Trump is making China the central front in his trade war, aiming to punish intellectual-property infringement by Chinese companies, abetted by strong-arm tactics from Beijing. That became clearer after Lighthizer said that the European Union, Brazil, South Korea, Argentina and others would get at least temporary exemptions from the steel and aluminum tariffs as negotiations proceed. Exemptions already had been granted to Mexico and Canada.The tariffs aimed against China aren't enough to have a noticeable impact on economic growth, and it's not yet clear how China will respond in the short term. But the stock market fallout on Thursday may reflect an understanding by investors that U.S. has begun confronting China in what will be a long-term conflict with major ramifications for economic relations.""The damage will be real, it will probably be substantial, and it will mount over time,"" wrote Brad McMillan, Chief Investment Officer for Commonwealth Financial Network. ""For companies that sell to China, or indeed any country outside the U.S., the effects are likely to be negative — which is why markets are reacting again.""Boeing (BA), which China has previously said could be targeted for reprisals if Trump starts a trade war, helped lead the Dow Jones lower early Thursday. Caterpillar (CAT), another Dow Jones component that could see exports suffer and also could face collateral damage if China retaliates against U.S. agricultural imports, also traded lower. Boeing was off 5.3% and Caterpillar 5.7% on the stock market today.Ahead of the announcement, Best Buy (BBY) told Reuters on Wednesday that it will stop selling mobile phones from China's Huawei. Apple (AAPL), which contracts out global iPhone production in China and sells a lot of phones in the country, is also potentially vulnerable in a trade war. But Beijing has no incentive to make it harder for tech firms to use China as a manufacturing base. Shares of Apple, yet another Dow Jones component, fell 1.4% after sliding below the 50-day line Wednesday.Stock market reaction will depend on the scale and timing of U.S. trade restrictions, and on China's response. So far, China seems to be emphasizing plans to respond by targeting soybeans and other agricultural imports, and halting progress on greater access to China's financial sector and other markets.While China is expected to strike back, it may do so in a relatively limited fashion as it challenges Trump's actions at the World Trade Organization. That would initially limit the scope of the conflict.That also would mirror the European Union's plan to retaliate if Trump's steel and aluminum tariffs go into effect, as they could as soon as Friday. The EU has detailed a list of $3.4 billion worth of American products that could face retaliatory tariffs, including Harley-Davidson (HOG) motorcycles, Jack Daniels whiskey and Florida orange juice, but it plans to double down if the WTO ultimately finds Trump's tariffs justified on national-security grounds to be illegal.Trump's authority to hit China with tariffs comes from section 301 of the 1974 Trade Act, which has seen little use since the WTO came on the scene. The act gives the president power to impose tariffs or other restrictions when a trading partner ""engages in discriminatory or other acts or policies which are unjustifiable or unreasonable and which burden or restrict United States commerce.""The Trump administration has asked China to propose ways of narrowing the $375 billion U.S. goods deficit with Beijing by $100 billion, but it's not clear that a confrontational approach will yield progress.Hitting China with massive tariffs may be difficult to do without hurting American consumers and American brands produced in China. As Trump prepares to direct relatively heavy economic fire toward China, trade groups representing Walmart (WMT), Apple, Best Buy and other retailers warned that tariffs would raise prices for American consumers, whether or not tariffs prove effective in shrinking the trade deficit. Under Armour (UAA), Nike (NKE) and other shoe companies echoed similar concerns. (Walmart and Nike are both Dow Jones components, with Nike reporting earnings late Thursday.)Trump's economic advisors are focused on taxing U.S. imports that are key to Beijing's Made in China 2025 initiative aimed at achieving global technology leadership. Tariffs are expected to go hand-in-hand with investment restrictions that blunt China's ability to acquire American technology. Among the possibilities would be restricting the ability of Chinese companies to list on U.S. stock indexes.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Stock Futures Fall On New Trump Headlines; 2 Hot Memory Plays Crush ViewsSteel Stocks Dive On Trump Tariff Exemptions As China Trade Is Top PriorityFed Rate Hike Is No Surprise, But Stock Market Weakens On Powell, 2019 OutlookAI Stock And Alibaba IoT Partner With 217% Growth Enters Buy Zone

27,HOG,"President Trump will indefinitely delay imposing steel and aluminum tariffs on Mexico and Canada, but other countries could face tariffs within 15 days.X Trump explained his policy Thursday afternoon before a signing ceremony, saying that other countries will be invited to negotiate exemptions from import tariffs of 25% on steel and 10% on aluminum.Trump said he was acting to stop ""an assault on our country"" in the form of cheap, imported industrial metal, calling it ""not merely an economic disaster, but a national security disaster.""He claimed that his policy is already paying dividends, with U.S. Steel (X) and Century Aluminum (CENX) both announcing increased capacity and hiring.Trump said that in the next 15 days his administration will decide which countries will face tariffs and to what extent, based on ""who's treating us fairly,"" not just in regard to trade but also military relationships.Wall Street seemed relieved about the clarification with regard to Mexico and Canada. America's Nafta partners account for 25% of U.S. steel imports but are also major export markets for U.S.-made steel.The Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite all strengthened to close modestly higher on the stock market today.

Boeing and GM shares turned higher on Thursday afternoon, while Ford was off 0.2%.Still, the sense of relief on Wall Street is far from complete. The European Union has threatened to retaliate if Trump moves forward with the tariffs, targeting companies like Harley-Davidson (HOG).Steel and aluminum tariffs aren't the only trade concern likely to occupy Wall Street in the months to come. The White House is also reportedly mulling wide-ranging tariffs on Chinese imports to punish Beijing for permitting rampant theft of U.S. intellectual property.The Trump administration is asking China to propose actions that would shrink the bilateral trade deficit by $100 billion.Trump has tried to provide reassurance that the impact of the steel and aluminum tariffs would be largely benign, saying it would be done in a ""loving"" way and inviting key trading partners to negotiate an alternative to his proposed trade prescription.On Thursday he went further, talking about the flexible approach he would take in setting or adjusting the 25% and 10% rates on a country-by-country basis. ""I'll have a right to go up or go down depending on the country, and I'll have a right to drop out countries or add countries.""Yet there's more than a little danger that Trump is miscalculating. The environment for negotiating may turn poisonous if he enacts tariffs that trading partners see as unjustified and a danger to a global trading system which has depended on respect for World Trade Organization rules.Trump's steel tariffs are seen as an affront by most U.S. trading partners because the bulk of steel industry overcapacity comes from China, yet China itself would barely be touched, at least directly, by the 25% tax since it accounts for just 2% of U.S. steel imports.Trump seems to be using the threat of steel tariffs as leverage to undo other perceived inequities with trading partners that contribute to the high U.S. trade deficit. Yet the whole effort undermines the justification for his tariffs — that the U.S. will impose them because a glut of steel and aluminum imports poses a danger to national security.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Trump Agrees To Meet Kim Jong Un; Stock Futures RiseThese Three Dow Jones Stocks Are Near Buy Points As 2 FANGs Make Bullish MoveThe Big Picture: This Is The Real News For InvestorsHere Are 10 Chip Stocks Breaking Out, Hitting New Highs Or Setting UpWhat Do Facebook, Grubhub, Salesforce And Epam Have In Common?

29,HOG,"In the first big split between the Republican-led Congress and President Trump, House Speaker Paul Ryan and GOP members of the House Ways and Means Committee have come out in opposition to the proposed tariffs on U.S. steel and aluminum imports.X While opposition is one thing, the Washington Post reported that congressional Republicans are privately talking about ""other options"" to keep Trump from risking a trade war if the White House doesn't reconsider, raising the possibility of legislation.It's far from clear whether a veto-proof majority to handcuff Trump on trade could be assembled, given that some Democrats praised last week's tariff announcement and that party lines on trade have increasingly blurred. It's possible that the odds of bucking Trump would improve if his trade measures clearly backfire. Yet the potential for a congressional intervention may have helped ease concerns on Wall Street about the impending imposition of tariffs. The Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite also turned overnight losses into solid gains on the stock market today.Steel stocks — which surged on Thursday, when Trump sprung his surprise announcement amid White House infighting over the idea — were mostly lower Monday.

31,HOG,"The first big shot in the trade war that President Trump promises to launch next week by imposing a 25% tariff on steel imports would be aimed at China but score a direct hit on Canada.X Canada is the biggest steel exporter to the U.S., shipping 5.8 million metric tons in 2017, or about 16% of total steel imports. Yet Canada is also, far and away, the largest export market for U.S. steelmakers. Through the first three quarters of 2017, the U.S. ran a relatively minor trade deficit with Canada of about a half-million metric tons, according to Department of Commerce data.Mexico, although it's the No. 4 source of U.S. imports of steel, actually imported more steel from the U.S. than it sent here through the first three quarters of 2017.On the other hand, China, which the Commerce Department characterizes as by far the worst offender, accounting for about half of global steel overcapacity, only provides about 2% of U.S. imports, so it won't feel much direct impact from a 25% tariff.In other words, it's hard to imagine a clumsier, more ham-handed way of seeking to redress unfair trade practices than a 25% tariff on global steel imports. The collateral damage may include workers from Ford (F) and General Motors (GM), along with American car buyers and — if the Dow Jones industrial average's 420-point dive on Thursday is any indication — U.S. stock investors.By the time foreign trade partners hit back with reprisals, the tariffs may boomerang on Harley-Davidson (HOG), Jack Daniels and soybean farmers, and the list may get a lot longer.All of that could mean lost jobs in other industries and higher costs for consumers on a wide range of goods.""You'll have protection for a long time,"" President Trump on Thursday told executives of U.S. Steel (X) and Nucor (NUE), among others, saying he'll make 25% steel tariffs and 10% aluminum tariffs official next week.Shares of U.S. Steel rose nearly 6%, Steel Dynamics (STLD) 4%, Nucor 3% and AK Steel (AKS) 10% in Thursday trading on the stock market today.IBD'S TAKE: The sell-off triggered by President Trump's tariff plan has changed the outlook for the stock market, The Big Picture column explained on Thursday. Now that stock market volatility has returned, it's more important than ever to read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines. Despite reported divisions in the White House over the wisdom of major tariffs, Trump appeared determined to stick to his guns. The import tariffs — easily his most far-reaching protectionist trade measures — were recommended by the Commerce Department, which cited national security concerns to justify support of U.S. steel and aluminum producers with high tariffs on imports.National security concerns haven't been used to justify the imposition of tariffs for decades. There's little reason to think that the action would comply with World Trade Organization rules, though that doesn't appear to worry Trump. President George W. Bush backed down about 18 months after imposing steel tariffs in 2002, just as European nations were getting ready to launch trade reprisals. This time, foreign trade partners are unlikely to hesitate for long because they've been preparing for Trump to follow through on his America First rhetoric.Commerce recommended global tariffs of 24% on steel imports and 7.7% on aluminum, along with a range of other options aimed at bringing capacity utilization in the two domestic industries up to 80%.Trump apparently bumped up the recommendation to a 25% steel tariff because he liked the round number. At least for now, Trump appears to be insisting on no exceptions to the tariffs, which threatens to create a crisis situation with Canada and Mexico, and likely other nations as well.Other top steel exporters to the U.S. include Brazil, South Korea, Russia, Turkey, Japan, Germany and Taiwan.The Commerce Department had provided Trump with an alternative approach that would have shielded both Canada and Mexico. That option would have levied a 53% tariff on a select group of countries, including Brazil, South Korea, Russia, Turkey, India, Vietnam, China, Thailand, South Africa, Egypt, Malaysia and Costa Rica. Those countries, the Commerce Department notes, account for just 4% of steel exports from the U.S.Defense Secretary James Mattis in February raised concern about the ""negative impact on our key allies,"" advising that ""target tariffs are more preferable than a global quota or global tariff.""YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:The Big Picture: Trump Tariff Sell-Off Triggers New OutlookInvestors Suddenly Realize Trump's New Agenda Isn't Market FriendlyFed Inflation Gauge Stays Tame, But Here's 6 Reasons Why Investors Are NervousWhat Is Inflation, And Why Does It Matter To The Fed — And You?Amazon Vs.

32,HOG,"William Harley and his best friend Arthur Davidson wanted to make their bicycles go faster with less effort by attaching a small motor.Their prototype wasn't powerful enough, so they asked Arthur's brother, Walter, who was a machinist, for help. Another Davidson brother, Bill, surreptitiously made other parts at the machine shop where he worked and from 1903 to 1904 they built and sold their first three motorcycles.It was the humble beginnings of what would become Harley-Davidson (HOG), which last year had $6 billion in revenues and net income of $692 million and remains one of the world's most iconic brands.""Harley-Davidson is associated with freedom, rebelliousness, adventure, and flirting with danger — racing our Hogs,"" said Oliver Shokouh, owner since 1976 of Harley-Davidson of Glendale, Calif. ""It's also a brand identified with patriotism, since Harleys played an important role in all our 20th century conflicts, starting with the effort to stop Pancho Villa's raids from Mexico.""
"
33,HOG,"""As you read through the history of our founders, you'll see key business themes that are still pillars of our business today,"" Katie Whitmore, the company's manager of corporate reputation, told IBD. ""They worked tirelessly to build great motorcycles, establish a strong dealer network and expand the company's global presence. Our founders showed great passion and forward-thinking in new product development.""The founders were all born in Milwaukee: Bill Davidson in 1870, Walter in 1876, Arthur in 1881 and William Harley in 1880.Arthur, who created wooden models of mining equipment for a manufacturer, and co-worker Harley, a draftsman with experience at a bike factory, attended a stage show featuring a three-wheeled bike with a single-cylinder motor. Inspired, Arthur designed an air-cooled motor, while Harley invented a bike with a loop frame strong enough to carry it on the rough local roads.But in 1903, frustrated by two years of technical problems, they wrote Walter, a self-taught electrician and machinist who was working for a railroad in Kansas. An enthusiastic bicycle racer, he returned to help them build their first production model, which was sold to a friend, and they moved out of the Davidson basement into a 10-foot-by-15-foot shed in the backyard.In 1905 they hired their first full-time employee, and five more were added the next year when they moved to a new factory on Chester Street, a single-story building 600 feet by 40 feet wide (renamed Juneau Avenue, where the corporate headquarters is today). They turned out 50 motorcycles in 1906 and 150 the following year, according to the company historian.1907 was a turning point in many ways, as they incorporated and Bill joined them to oversee the manufacturing process. He would always remain in close touch with the workers on the floor, no matter how big the company got, using their insights to make constant improvements.Harley, who had taken time out to go to the University of Wisconsin's engineering school, graduated the same year and agreed to take charge of product development, eventually receiving 67 patents.Arthur's outgoing personality made him the natural general sales manager — traveling the country, and later the world, recruiting dealers. He masterminded advertising, became an early proponent of sales on an installment plan, and foresaw the need for training specialist mechanics and the development of the Harley-Davidson Service School, according to his biography on the company's website.Walter was the company's first general manager and president, with responsibility for relations with the growing number of investors.For many years they worked together seven days a week until at least 10 p.m. and remained lifelong friends.Walter transferred his love for racing bikes to motorcycles and earned the company some publicity by competing in races. The other founders weren't sure that was a good idea, since they viewed races as dangerous. They preferred to have their cycles associated with pleasant leisure activities, like going fishing or on a romantic picnic.But in 1908, Walter won a major motorcycle endurance contest, the Federation of American Motorcyclists' 175-mile ride through New York's Catskill Mountains, and everyone was caught up in the excitement at beating their archrival, Indian Motorcycle, according to the company's official history.The same year, Harley-Davidson sold its first cycles to law enforcement, based on the company's rising reputation for consistent quality. It would also increasingly be viewed as the industry's leading innovator, with such inventions as the first clutch, the three-speed transmission, the carburetor choke, and the step-starter, Harley-Davidson's historian said.In 1913, a new five-story plant covering 300,000 square feet opened, with a workforce of 1,500, and Arthur lined up their first overseas distributor, in Japan.Four years later, the United States entered World War I and Harley-Davidson modified its products for military use, turning out 15,000 for the Allies.In 1920, the company had become the largest motorcycle manufacturer in the world, making nearly 28,000 bikes for dealers in 67 countries. But as cars became less expensive and competed for daily transportation, sales declined, and with the stock market crash in October 1929, the year ended with just 21,000 sold. Those figures hit bottom in 1933, with sales of only 3,703.But Harley-Davidson responded with major innovations, including the Flathead and Knucklehead OHV engines, and by the end of the 1930s, Indian Motorcycle was its only serious American competitor. Then World War II brought demand for over 70,000 of the H-D military model.By the end of the war, the leadership of the company had dramatically changed. Bill Davidson had died in 1937 at 66. Walter was next, in 1942 at 65, and William Harley passed a year later at 62. Arthur was killed in a car accident in 1950 at age 69.The following generations of Davidsons and Harleys helped keep the brand on course to become a global icon, but there were plenty of big bumps in the road along the way.In 1969, American Machine and Foundry (AMF) bought the company, streamlining production and slashing the workforce. This resulted in a labor strike, after which quality declined and sales tanked — so much so that Harley-Davidson was on the verge of bankruptcy when it was bought out in 1981 by a group of its executives for $81.5 million. One of them was Jeffrey Bleustein, the vice president of engineering, who became CEO in 1997 until he stepped down in 2005.""We realized that management and the unions had many more things we agreed on than areas where we had differences and learned to respect each other's views on the areas of difference and to work around those to achieve our mutual goals,"" Bleustein told IBD in 2009. ""People throughout the company know more about the work they do in their area than the bosses do, so they are the best people to figure out what needs to be done if you want to improve performance, increase quality, reduce cost, etc. Moreover, people will work smarter and harder on their own ideas.""The motorcycle industry has been soft recently, but in the 2016 letter to shareholders, Harley-Davidson's CEO, Matt Levatich, noted strong overseas growth and a plan to add 2 million more riders in the U.S. ""As stewards of the most powerful motorcycle brand in the world, we are called to grow our sport by engaging and inspiring new riders just as our founders did 114 years ago,"" he wrote.""It's the great equalizer,"" Harley-Davidson dealer Shokouh said of the bikes. ""Your gender, race, education, or job don't matter and every generation of Americans since the company's inception has been influenced by its mystique.""Blogger Hydar Saharudin at ReferralCandy recently explained customers' loyalty this way: ""The Harley Owners Group (H.O.G.) has been a resounding marketing success, with more than a million members in 25 countries, and half of them regularly attend Harley-Davidson events. Members are encouraged to provide direct input into how Harley creates new products and improves current ones and because of H.O.G. and its push for greater customer engagement and ownership, Harley-Davidson spends less than a million dollars on advertising each year.""One of the most successful of those sponsored events, the annual Motorcycle Rally in Sturgis, S.D., celebrates its 77th year beginning Aug. 4, and is expected to draw over half a million enthusiasts.They committed to continuing cutting-edge excellence in making Harley-Davidson motorcycles.Overcame: No experience running a company.Lesson: Innovation can always make the ""perfect"" product even better.""Personal service is really the keynote of our organization … and that service has been proven a good investment is evidenced by the fact that the company has been successful from the start.""—Walter DavidsonMORE ABOUT LEADERS & SUCCESS:Soichiro Honda Built An Automotive Empire With Elbow GreaseMeet The Man Best Buy Hired To Take On Amazon'Shark' Daymond John Wrapped His Brand In Hip-Hop MystiqueSupermodel Kathy Ireland Became A Role Model For Moguls

Revenue fell 5% to $1.77 billion, said the company.Harley brought in $1.577 billion in revenue from motorcycles and related products, a slight miss from Zacks estimates for $1.595 billion in revenue. The company reported financial services revenue of $188,034.Harley blamed ""weak industry conditions"" for the 9.3% decline in new retail motorcycle sales in the U.S. from the prior-year quarter, which translated to 49,668 units sold. Internationally, new retail sales were ""also down but generally in-line with company expectations for the second quarter of 2017,"" it said.Peer Polaris (PII) reports Q2 results on Thursday.

36,HOG,"Politics: While Chelsea Clinton is busy peddling her new children's book about inspirational women, titled ""She Persisted,"" Democrats are trying to get her mother to stop persisting. The irony is apparently lost on them.Earlier this week, The Hill ran a story titled ""Dems want Hillary Clinton to leave spotlight."" It quoted party types saying things like ""Good God, what is she doing?"" and ""Blaming everyone else is not a good political strategy.""Clinton is taking hits from liberal commentators as well, who are now arguing that she ""doesn't seem to realize that the curtain has come down on her political career"" and that she's ""driving a double-decker bus over her party."" Stop making excuses, they say. Stop talking about 2016.Note that these calls didn't come months ago when Clinton was claiming that the Russians stole the election, or blaming James Comey, or attacking the media for supposedly fixating on her email problems.She told CNN's Christiane Amanpour in early May that ""I'm back to being an active citizen and part of the resistance."" Soon after she announced the formation of Onward Together, which has been billed as a political organization aimed at funding groups ""standing up to Trump."" Nobody told her to stop then.It wasn't until Clinton started attacking her own party that calls for the hook started to come. During an interview at a conference in California, Clinton's long list of excuses for why she lost expanded to include the Democratic National Committee, which, according to her, was worse than useless.""I mean, it was bankrupt. It was on the verge of insolvency,"" she said. ""Its data was mediocre to poor, nonexistent, wrong. I had to inject money into it.""That, it seems, was over the line.The irony of liberals calling for Clinton to shut up is amazing. The title of Chelsea's book, after all, is based on a now widely used feminist phrase that originated with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who, when trying to stop Elizabeth Warren from talking after she violated Senate rules of decorum, said that ""She was warned. She was given an explanation. Nevertheless, she persisted.""No matter. Clinton clearly has no intention of following the advice of her Democratic detractors. She injected herself in the news again this week, issuing a thinly veiled attack on President Trump for using the terrorist attack on London Bridge ""for political gain."" No doubt she will feel obligated to weigh in on any number of other issues. Plus, she'll soon have a book of her own to peddle.We are not ones to speculate about other people's motives, but perhaps the real reason Democrats want Clinton off the stage is because she represents a stark and unflattering reminder of everything that's wrong with the Democratic Party these days.Think about it. Like the rest of her party, Hillary Clinton is bitter, angry, elitist, entitled, and out of ideas.Clinton's only interest these days is in launching angry attacks at President Trump and saying he somehow stole the election. How is that different from the rest of the Democratic Party?Like her party, Clinton had no ideas when she ran for office, and has none today. Neither she nor anyone else in her party has any ideas on how to boost economic growth or how to create more jobs and prosperity in areas that have seen too little of both; no ideas for reforming entitlement programs; no plans for fixing the disaster known as ObamaCare; no strategy for confronting the Islamic terrorist threat.Clinton's elitism is also a perfect reflection of today's Democrats, who seem to view those residing outside liberal urban enclaves as unwashed racist ignoramuses unworthy of being allowed to vote. It was Hillary, remember, who referred to Trump voters as ""deplorables.""Likewise, Clinton's sense of entitlement is an embodiment of the Democratic Party's message to any and all special interest groups.Democrats might not like having Clinton hog the stage. But it's not as though they would be saying anything different.RELATED:Hillary's 'Everyone But Me' Blame-Game For Her Epic Loss Is Getting Real OldDisagreeing With Democrats Is Now Considered Un-AmericanClinton Email Scandal ExplainedClinton Foundation Scandal

39,HOG,"The best mutual funds the past 10 years in U.S. taxable fixed income had a common thread: They were risk takers.IBD Best Mutual Fund Awards were given to U.S. taxable, international and municipal bond funds. Winners had to have at least $100 million in assets and beat their respective benchmarks in each of the one, three, five and 10-year periods through December 2016. Best of the best awards went to the top five benchmark beaters ranked by 10-year returns.In the domestic taxable universe, the top three performers were BTS Tactical Fixed Income A (BTFAX), Delaware Extended Duration Bond Institutional (DEEIX) and AB High Income A (AGDAX) with 10-year returns of 8.53%, 8.47% and 8.17%, respectively. In 2016 alone, they racked up 13.79%, 7.5% and 15.17% each.The $665 million BTS fund focuses not just on providing income to bond investors, but also capital appreciation. Over 85% of the fund is in high-yield bond ETFs, but it also uses defensive capital preservation strategies such as stop-loss measures to reduce downside risk. This top performer doesn't come cheap: it has a maximum load, or commission, of 5% and a 1.58% expense ratio. Its current yield is 2.8% and it has a duration, a measure of sensitivity to interest changes, of a relatively low 3.89 years.Delaware Extended Duration is much more sensitive to rate changes, having a duration of 13.4 years. That sensitivity has propped up its yield to 3.7%. The fund charges a 0.71% annual fee. Its average credit quality is BBB.As spreads have tightened significantly in the corporate bond market and interest rates are expected to rise in 2017, the key message is to ""follow coupon, because coupon is going to help offset some of your price declines,"" said Jennifer Vail, head of fixed income research at U.S. Bank.Internationally, GMO Emerging Country Debt III (GMCDX), TCW Emerging Markets Income I (TGEIX) and Fidelity New Markets Income (FNMIX) were the winners with 8.37%, 7.89% and 7.26% 10-year average annual returns, respectively. Last year paid off well in the emerging markets as those funds brought in between 13% and 15% in returns.Fidelity's $5.2 billion New Markets Income fund mostly invests in dollar-denominated sovereign and parastatal debt of emerging market countries. Manager John Carlson, who has run the fund since June 1995, keeps about two-thirds in sovereign and quasi-sovereign debt, and allocates the rest in sources of alpha such as local currency bonds, whether corporate or government, or even equities.""I tend to keep the fund in more liquid positions rather than illiquids,"" said Carlson. ""My approach is based on the mosaic approach. I'm looking to build a picture of a sovereign country's ability and willingness to repay their debt.""To achieve this goal, Carlson travels to those countries to speak with top government and corporate officials. Carlson does not use derivatives, leverage or shorting, and prefers to manage the fund in a consistent manner.Last year, Carlson successfully took advantage of very wide credit spreads in the oil-producing countries when oil prices fell to below $30 a barrel. As such, he overweighted oil bonds such as Petrobras, Petroleos De Venezuela, Argentina Republic and Russian Federation. ""Those oil credits were responsible for probably a couple of 100 basis points of outperformance,"" he said.At the same time, he went underweight investment grade credits, such as the Philippines, China, Poland and Indonesia, where he felt spreads were too tight.Aside from the strong performance exhibited by emerging markets bond funds, global bond funds with a more broadly diversified bond portfolio also did well. GuideStone Funds Global Bond Investors (GGBFX)'s 10.91% return in 2016 got a lift from an opportunistic allocation to high yield, bank loans, convertible debt, emerging markets and U.S. investment grade financials and industrials credits.""We provide a fund that has a very broad opportunity set and give the ability to our underlying subadvisors to have the flexibility and opportunity to go where there are dislocations in the market place,"" said Matt Peden, chief investment officer at GuideStone Capital Management. The $444 million fund is subadvised by Loomis Sayles and Western Asset Management. It carries a yield of 3.83% and a fee of 0.82%.Prudential Global Total Return A (GTRAX) looks for as many different alpha drivers as possible. The $730 million fund has a strong focus on security selection and sector allocation. ""While interest-rate and currency positioning for some global funds are the primary focus, for us those are secondary activities; primary for us is bottom-up asset selection — finding a diversified set of the best risk-adjusted opportunities,"" said fund manager Robert Tipp.The fund benefited from high-quality structured credit such as CMBS, emerging market sovereigns and high yield corporate bonds in 2016. ""It was an environment where expectations of economic growth and a relatively docile Fed backdrop was very conducive to spread contraction,"" Tipp noted.The fund returned 2.59% in 2016 and 5.01% for the 10 years. It yields 3.52% and has an expense ratio of 0.97%.Among nontaxable bonds, performance was quite even for the 10-year period. Top three performers are the Nuveen CA Municipal Bond (NCSPX), Ivy Municipal High Income I (WYMHX) and Delaware National High-Yield Muni Bond A (CXHYX) with 4.99%, 4.97% and 4.97%, respectively.Muni high-yield bonds did especially well in the first part of last year. But they behaved in a rather unusual fashion following the U.S. presidential election in November, underperforming corporate high yield.""Despite the end-of-year performance downturn, municipal high yield is currently offering both outstanding relative value and attractive yields,"" noted Jim Colby, portfolio manager for municipal bonds at VanEck in a recent report. ""I believe it's time to hit the ""reset"" button and reconsider municipal high yield.""RELATED:Next ETF Leaders For Rising Interst Rates

70,HOG,"George Soros took stakes in Facebook (FB) and Dow component Goldman Sachs (GS) in the fourth quarter, while Appaloosa cut its stake in Apple (AAPL), and both followed Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BKRB) in appearing to find a bargain in airlines. Here's a look at how some big investors managed their portfolios in the last quarter of last year.Soros Fund Management bought 353,686 shares in Facebook and bulked up its stake in Alphabet (GOOGL) by nearly 60% to 20,200 shares, according to a regulatory filing out late Tuesday. Soros also increased his T-Mobile (TMUS) stake to 685,700 shares.Soros bought 62,100 shares in Goldman Sachs. Dan Loeb's Third Point last week disclosed that it had scooped up shares of Goldman, Bank of America (BAC) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM).Bank stocks have risen on greater expectations of lighter regulations, higher interest rates and greater volatility, which Goldman's trading desk could benefit from in particular.Soros also took a 40,000-share stake in Delta Air Lines (DAL), but dropped United Airlines (UAL).Shares of Apple ended regular trading up 0.4% to 135.51 on the stock market today, after hitting a record high yesterday. Facebook fell 0.3% to 133.44, while Goldman Sachs rose 0.4% to 250.54. Delta climbed 2.6% to 51.17, American rose 2.1% to 47.54, and United gained 2.7% to 75.75.IBD'S TAKE: Even as big investors flocked to the airlines last year, Cowen analysts last month said shares of airlines could be ""due for a break"" after taking off in Q4. Meanwhile, Soros dropped Activision Blizzard (ATVI), Herbalife (HLF), Harley Davidson (HOG), PepsiCo (PEP) and JCPenney (JCP). He also dissolved his stake in Nordstrom (JWN)Soros also offloaded his position in consumer-care products giant Procter & Gamble (PG), which got a lift Tuesday after activist investor Trian took a more than $3 billion stake in the company.Hedge fund Appaloosa Management increased its stake in Facebook by 47% to 2.2 million shares. The fund also upped its holdings in Qualcomm (QCOM) and more than doubled its stake in Southwest (LUV). Appaloosa also took a 160,000-share stake in United Airlines.The fund loaded up on the health sector, taking new stakes in companies like Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY), Centene (CNC), McKesson (MCK) and Pfizer (PFE). It also took a new stake in JCPenney.Appaloosa cut its position in Apple by 350,000 shares, slashed its stake in Yahoo (YHOO) and rid itself of Bank of America and General Motors (GM).Along with boosting its stake in Apple, David Einhorn's Greenlight Capital dissolved its stake in Take-Two Interactive (TTWO), U.S. Steel (X) and Michael Kors (KORS).Like Buffett, Greenlight also took a stake in Monsanto (MON).But the moves by Soros and Appaloosa into airlines are notable in that they could signal other big investors are following Buffett, who announced Q3 stakes in the sector last year.Buffett, after years of avoiding the airlines, has come around to the industry. Airlines last year showed more signs of discipline, and the wave of consolidation over the past several years has kept the major airlines relatively insulated from new competition.""When we launched on the sector late last year, we found most investors generally in agreement that airlines represented deep value,"" Barclays analyst Brandon Oglenski wrote in a research note dated Tuesday.""The biggest question remains: when will the market and, more importantly, large long-term investors begin to care? We think tonight's Berkshire Hathaway 13F will go a long way to attract sector interest.""RELATED:Airline Stocks Tumble On Fears Capacity May Creep Back UpDelta, American, United Go Guns Blazing Into Battle Of The AtlanticJPMorgan Sets Fresh High, Goldman Hits Highest Since 2007 On Yellen

73,HOG,"As malls die, Macy's (M) plans huge job cuts, and Sears (SHLD) closes 150 stores, online sales on sites like Amazon (AMZN) and devices like your Apple (AAPL) iPhone, to the surprise of perhaps nobody, were higher during the 2016 holiday season.Online sales rose 11% a record $91.7 billion, Adobe (ADBE) said Thursday, slightly surpassing the company's own expectations for $91.6 billion. More of those sales were made via mobile devices, which drove half of site visits, Adobe said. Mobile sales jumped 23% to $28.43 billion.Other surveys have suggested that Amazon grabbed a huge share of that e-commerce growth. But it didn't entirely hog the spotlight. Online auction site eBay (EBAY) was the most mentioned retailer on social media, ""with eBay sellers promoting their items for purchase and eBay buyers highlighting products they bought that they couldn't find in stores,"" Adobe said.Amazon shares rose 3.1% to 780.45 in heavy volume on the stock market today, retaking its 50-day moving average. Amazon hadn't closed above that key support level since Oct. 27, when the online giant missed earnings estimates and gave cautious guidance.Shares of eBay edged up, continuing to trade comfortably above their 50-day. Apple, which announced December App Store revenue hit $3 billion in December, also nudged higher, close to a buy point.Amazon, Wal-Mart (WMT) and Target (TGT) lagged eBay in social-media mentions.Pokemon Sun/Moon was the most frequently mentioned product, followed by Barbie, Oculus and Legos.""But it's not just the total online sales figure that made this a historic holiday shopping season,"" said Tamara Gaffney, principal analyst and director at Adobe Digital Insights, in a statement. ""This year, Black Friday set a new record by surpassing the $3 billion mark for the first time at $3.34 billion, with high growth in the evening hours.""Black Friday also became the first day in retail history to bring in more than $1 billion in mobile sales, she said.And Adobe's report indicated that more people are doing their buying later in the holiday season — posing more challenges to the delivery infrastructures of UPS (UPS) and FedEx (FDX).Sales accelerated closer to the end of last month, Adobe said, as shipping cutoff dates approached and more customers made purchases online and picked them up in stores.IBD'S TAKE: As malls become relics of the retail and real estate world and Amazon comes to dominate more forms of commerce, many store chains will face a reckoning this year.The gains in online sales have come at the expense of many brick-and-mortar retailers. Macy's and Kohl's (KSS) slashed earnings views late Wednesday as both reported a 2.1% same-store sales decline in November and December. Barnes & Noble (BKS) also said holiday sales were grim, while Sears announced a new raft of store closures and sold its Craftsman tool line.Macy's shares crashed 14% Thursday, Kohl's 19% and Barnes & Noble nearly 7%. Other department stores, apparel retailers and makers and other retail-related groups were big losers Thursday.Those follow other signs that physical stores were suffering.Handbag maker and retailer Kate Spade (KATE) is reportedly exploring a sale, while Nordstrom (JWN) management, according to a JPMorgan report, said brick-and-mortar traffic was at its worst levels in more than 40 years.Off-price retailers, however, have fared better against the likes of Amazon in part due to their ""treasure hunt"" appeal, in which shoppers don't entirely know what kind of bargain they're going to find.RELATED:Christmas Meltdown: Macy's, Kohl's, Kors, Fossil, L Brands, OthersWhat's Driving The Success Of 'Un-Amazon-Able' Ulta Beauty?Ross Stores: A No-Nonsense Retailer Free From Amazon's Clutches

Meanwhile, rival Polaris is looking to make gains.Polaris' Indian Motorcycle brand, which has traditional appeal that rivals Harley's hogs, has seen ""increased throughput,"" noted Dionisio.Q4 motorcycle sales grew by 50% to reach $103.5 million, fueled by the Indian brand.In Q1, Polaris' revenue is estimated to have jumped 13% to $1.004 billion, a slower pace than Q4's 18% increase. Earnings are expected to grow by 7.6% to $1.28 a share. That's a slowdown from the prior quarter's 27% growth.Last fall, Polaris debuted a three-wheel motorcycle, the Slingshot. In addition to motorcycles, Polaris focuses on all-terrain vehicles and snowmobiles.Polaris, which reports its results before the open on Thursday, increased 1.6% to 144.79 on Monday.

100,HOG,"Shares of Arctic Cat (ACAT) sank on Wednesday after the snowmobile and all-terrain vehicle manufacturer slashed its full-year outlook, citing high ATV inventory and a difficult international environment, even though the company's third-quarter earnings per share topped expectations.The company now expects 2015 sales of $705 million-$715 million, down from an earlier forecast of $745 million-$755 million and far short of analyst expectations of $748 million. Arctic Cat forecast 2015 adjusted earnings per share of $1.24-$1.32, cut from the company's prior view of $1.55 to $1.65 and not at all close to analyst expectations for 1.97.Arctic Cat said it would take a $7 million charge this year to help reduce dealers' older inventory more quickly. The company also said international sales would fall this year due to ""macroeconomic headwinds"" and adverse foreign exchange in Canada, where Arctic Cat gets a third of its yearly sales.""Fiscal 2015 is a challenging year of transition where we are resetting our strategic priorities to deliver improved long-term performance,"" said CEO Christopher Metz, who assumed the post last month to turn the underperforming company around after the departure of Claude Jordan. ""At this time, we are lowering our fiscal 2015 full-year outlook for sales and earnings as we work through existing challenges. As we stated in the 2015 second quarter, one of our biggest challenges is rightsizing our core North America ATV dealer inventory levels. Bold actions are necessary to return to growth.""Shares fell 2.5% to 28.97 in the stock market today after hitting a three-year low of 26 early. The stock has tumbled over the past year after a series of disappointing earnings reports.Arctic Cat's EPS for the third quarter, which ended Dec. 31, slid 23% from a year earlier to 68 cents. But that soundly beat analyst estimates for 48 cents.Revenue fell 14% to $193.74 million, missing views for $198 million. Snowmobile sales fell 30% from a year ago to $81.5 million. That decline was largely the result of the timing of snowmobile shipments to an original equipment manufacturing partner. Those shipments were moved to fiscal Q1 and Q2, Arctic Cat says.Sales of ATV and side-by-side vehicles, however, rose 7% to $78.2 million. Sales gains in the company's Wildcat off-road vehicle did much of the heavy lifting, as core ATV sales fell, the company said.Sales of parts, garments and accessories fell 4%, weighed by sales snow-related parts, which suffered due to less snow, the company says.The results come a day after Polaris (PII), Arctic Cat's much bigger rival, said in its Q4 report that snowmobile sales rose 2% to $138.1 million due to an earlier winter in North America. Polaris, which also manufactures off-road vehicles and motorcycles, reported estimate-topping Q4 results but guided 2015 cautiously. Off-road-vehicle sales jumped 19%.Polaris shares fell 1.4% Wednesday afternoon after rising 5.4% on Tuesday.Harley-Davidson (HOG), the best known of this trio of boy toys for grown-ups, was unchanged in early afternoon trading.

128,HOG," California State Route 99 is the north-south highway that cuts through the great Central Valley. And it has changed little since the mid-1960s.A half-century ago, when the state population was about 18 million -- not nearly 40 million as it is today -- the 99 used to be a high-speed, four-lane marvel. It was a crown jewel in California's cutting-edge freeway system.Not now.The 99 was recently ranked by ValuePenguin (a private consumer research organization) as the deadliest major highway in the nation. Locals who live along its 400-plus miles often go to bed after seeing lurid TV news reports of nocturnal multi-car accidents. Then they wake up to Central Valley radio accounts of morning carnage on the 99.The 99 is undergoing a $1 billion, multi-decade upgrade to increase its four lanes to six. Promises have been made to build off- and on-ramps in place of haphazard exits and entries from the old days of cross traffic.In many of the most dangerous southern portions of the 99, huge semi trucks hog two lanes. Speeders weave in and out of traffic. They still try to drive 70 mph in the manner you could 50 years ago when traffic was less clogged. Text-messaging drivers are now even more dangerous than the intoxicated.The 99 is emblematic of a state in psychological and material decline.Running parallel to the southern portion of the 99 is an underused, subsidized Amtrak passenger rail line. Not far away is yet another rail corridor, where the state is plowing up some of its best farmland to build the first link of high-speed rail. That boondoggle's projected price tag has soared from the original $33 billion to somewhere between $60 and $100 billion -- without a single foot of track yet laid.Californians are apparently too sophisticated to allot $10 billion or so to first ensure that the state has adequate north-south freeways. In addition to the 99, state residents must also contend with the equally primitive coastal Highway 101 and the now-overcrowded Interstate 5.All societies in decline fixate on impossible postmodern dreams as a way of disguising their inability to address premodern problems.Ensuring that California's freeways were all six lanes, well-lit and safe would have been a gargantuan but practical task that could have been completed long ago and would have saved thousands of lives (though it would have required the admission that the mundane modern automobile was here to stay). Instead, cool bureaucrats and hip politicians preferred to blow money on visions of grandiose space-age rail.The 99 also reminds the nation of California's unique lessons about how to ruin a paradise: The more taxes are raised, the worse public service often becomes.Currently, Californians pay among the highest sales, income and gasoline taxes in the nation. Yet in return, the state's decrepit transportation system in many national surveys rates nearly last. California public school test scores are likewise near the bottom of national rankings.The state has become a pharaonic society of two classes. The coastal rich are exempt from financial worries over their high-tax dreams. And the subsidized poor in the state's interior live out the real-life consequences. Meanwhile, the disrespected middle class, without either high incomes or state entitlements, is leaving the state in droves.The 99 has become a neglected, poor person's highway. California has far more residents receiving welfare than any other state, and it has among the highest poverty rates in the nation. Most of the state's poorest counties are bisected by the 99. About a quarter of California's inhabitants were not born in the United States. Many are still not U.S. citizens.The result is a perfect storm that blows in daily over the 99.The hazardous conditions of stretches of the highway and the 99's enormous traffic volume are compounded by old and unsafe automobiles and trucks -- and by California's many inexperienced drivers, unfamiliar with U.S. driving etiquette and laws. The drivers of flatbed and pickup trucks on the 99 often do not tie down their loads.The highway can often resemble a two-lane obstacle course. It takes only a single lost mattress, a bin of overturned peaches or a motorcyclist failing to navigate between stalled cars to shut down the 99 -- and with it the state's north-south commerce.The 99 offers a number of banal (and oft-forgotten) lessons handed down from our grandparents, who mapped out what once was the nation's premier transportation system. Highways, along with damns, canals and bridges, are the lifeblood of a state, a far more important priority than investing in transgendered restrooms or efforts to save the Delhi Sands flower-loving fly.Only measured, diverse and legal immigration, coupled with rapid assimilation and integration, can ensure that diversity is a strength.The rich who can easily pay high taxes should not impose them on those who cannot.Finally, the dreams of elites become quite dangerous realities when first tried out on more vulnerable and distant ""others.""

130,HOG,"Harley-Davidson (HOG) has agreed to stop selling, buy back and destroy aftermarket engine tuners that the U.S. called emissions-control defeat devices.The Milwaukee-based company also agreed to pay a $12 million civil penalty as part of a settlement with the U.S. after being accused of violating air-pollution laws by selling the ""Screamin' Eagle"" engine tuners. Harley sold more than 339,000 of them from 2008 to 2015, according to a complaint filed Thursday in federal court in Washington.Harley is also required to sell only devices that comply with Clean Air Act emission standards. It will contribute another $3 million to mitigate air pollution under its deal with the Justice Department and Environmental Protection Agency.""Given Harley-Davidson's prominence in the industry, this is a very significant step toward our goal of stopping the sale of illegal aftermarket defeat devices that cause harmful pollution on our roads and in our communities,"" said Assistant Attorney General John C. Cruden, in a statement.Harley disputed the government's claim that by selling its tuner through its dealer network, it enabled dealers and customers to tamper with motorcycles used on public roads. The company said the tuner was designed and sold for off-road and closed-course competition.""This settlement is not an admission of liability but instead represents a good faith compromise with the E.P.A. on areas of law we interpret differently, particularly E.P.A's assertion that it is illegal for anyone to modify a certified vehicle even if it will be used solely for off-road/closed-course competition,"" said Ed Moreland, Harley's government affairs director, in a statement.The U.S. claims Harley manufactured and sold the so-called super-tuners devices that caused motorcycles to emit higher amounts of certain air pollutants than what the company certified to the government. Such devices alter emissions controls and are prohibited under the Clean Air Act on vehicles that have been certified to meet E.P.A. emission standards, the U.S. said.Harley-Davidson stock fell almost 8% on news of the lawsuit, but recovered somewhat on the settlement. Shares closed down 1.7% to 53.54 on the stock market today.

141,HOG,"Soft U.S. demand weighed on Harley-Davidson (HOG) retail sales during its second quarter, prompting the iconic motorcycle maker Thursday to cut full-year shipment guidance to 264,000-269,000 motorcycles globally this year, down from a prior outlook for 269,000-274,000 shipments to dealers.Harley-Davidson also cited a ""continued competitive environment and global economic uncertainty"" as contributing to the outlook shift, and it trimmed its motorcycle segment operating margin guidance to 15%-16% from 16%-17%.Shares started out down in premarket action, but ended trading up 0.9% to 51.01 on the stock market today.For Q2, the bike maker nevertheless beat on both the top and bottom lines.Earnings grew 8% to $1.55 on 1% revenue growth to $1.67 billion, coming out ahead of Wall Street projections for $1.53 a share and squeaking by views for sales of $1.665 billion.Harley-Davidson said domestic retail motorcycle sales declined 5.2% vs. the prior-year quarter, while international retail sales grew 4.3%.

Nintendo (NTDOY) is a shareholder in both of the two companies and also owns the trademarks to Pokemon and the Pokemon character names.""Pokemon Go,"" a free-to-play, location-based augmented reality game, has been the No. 1 most-downloaded game on the Apple (AAPL) App Store and Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google Play store since its July 6 launch.While the game is free to play, it sells in-game items that enhance the experience and help players advance. Apple and Google get a 30% share of in-game sales sold through their respective app stores.Nintendo stock rose 1.25% to 28.27 in the stock market today, though well off its five-year high above 38, touched July 18.

145,HOG,"Stocks remained lower into Tuesday's close but well off the session's worst levels, as Brexit worries draped over Wall Street, hitting major banks such as  U.S. Bancorp (USB) and Morgan Stanley (MS).The Nasdaq was down 0.7%, the S&P 500 0.6%, and the Dow Jones industrial average 0.5%. Volume was tracking higher on the NYSE and lower on the Nasdaq, compared to the previous session. Losers led winners by a 3-to-2 ratio on both the NYSE and Nasdaq.Financials were broadly lower, in particular the big banks. Those stocks were among the most battered about a week ago, when the shock of the Brexit vote first hit the markets. The European Central Bank is weighing state aid for eurozone banks, reports said Tuesday.Bank of New York Mellon (BK) and U.S. Bancorp were down more than 2% apiece, while Morgan Stanley lost more than 3%.Energy, transportation and retail were other sectors at the bottom of the day's performance list.Harley Davidson (HOG) slid 11%, retracing much of a 20% surge Friday, when the stock soared on buyout talk. But an analyst doused those reports, financial media sites said.With fresh worries over the U.K.'s decision to leave the European Union, most of the stocks down in big volume were European companies. Prudential (PUK) and Italian utility Eni (E) were down 8% and 4%, respectively. JPMorgan Chase downgraded Prudential to underweight from neutral.Both European companies were among the stocks with the highest volume compared to normal levels in the stock market today.On the plus side, Campbell Soup (CPB) broke out of a cup-shaped base with a 66.85 buy point.

"
146,HOG,"Checks And Balances: The House slashed the IRS' 2015 appropriation 15% for the agency's targeting of political dissidents and ObamaCare enforcement activities. This is a highly appropriate use of congressional power.Until now, evidence pointed to impunity for the errant Internal Revenue Service, whose tax-collecting function has been corrupted into an instrument of political repression against Tea Party groups and other political dissidents.The agency has admitted to persecuting groups on political grounds, and a few emails already show it. But it also has obstructed justice in ""losing"" two years' worth of emails sent by IRS operative Lois Lerner and six other officials to outside agencies, possibly to keep from Congress the facts about how high the corruption went.So instead of the respected and impartial civil-service outfit it was designed to be, and which it showed itself to be during the Nixon era, it's now little more than an instrument of the Democratic Party and the community organizers who lead it.Appointing a special prosecutor to root out wrongdoers is a non-starter. Any such appointee would be chosen by Attorney General Eric Holder, a political operative of the most partisan stripe, while the other remedy of impeaching the president — who first vowed to get to the bottom of the scandal and then backtracked to claim there was ""not a smidgen of corruption"" — is still politically off the table.That leaves the remedy with the congressional power of the purse, and it's a relief to see it being used to defund this agency gone bad.The House Appropriations Committee's financial services subcommittee slashed the IRS appropriation for 2015 to $10.95 billion, $341 million below this year's level and $1.5 billion below the White House's request. The cut puts the agency at its 2008 spending level.Congressional sources told IBD that the amount was set by the ""top level"" parameters of the Ryan-Murray budget, which determines what an agency needs to carry out its core mission and cuts out all the goodies that the bureaucrats had been hoping for.For bureaucrats who live as high on the hog as the IRS, with unearned bonuses that are among the items slated to be cut, this cut is going to sting. It should have been done a long time ago on efficiency grounds alone, but punishment for corruption works just as well.The appropriation is more than a line item in a theoretical budget — which Congress has yet to pass. It's the direct money line to the agency and will have to be reconciled with a Senate appropriation.But with the ball in the Senate's court, it would take a pretty shameless Democrat to object, given the contempt that the IRS has shown for the institution of Congress. Our House sources believe that much of it will get through. Our hats are off to them for even trying.

149,HOG,"Energy: At a ""Three Amigos"" summit in Ottawa this week, President Obama and the leaders of Canada and Mexico will pledge that in less than a decade, half of North America's energy will come from ""clean"" sources. The administration calls it ""ambitious."" We call it ""ludicrous.""Since the U.S. accounts for three-quarters of the total energy produced by these three countries, the responsibility of living up to any such agreement would fall most heavily on the U.S. So is there a reasonable chance that the U.S. could achieve such a goal?Let's look at some of the relevant facts.According to the Department of Energy's Energy Information Administration, ""clean energy"" -- nuclear, hydroelectric, solar, wind, biomass, etc. -- makes up less than one-fifth of U.S. energy production.Nuclear accounts for a little more than 8%, biomass just over 4%, solar and wind 3%, hydroelectric a bit more than 2%.So the only way to get there would be to dramatically increase one or all of these sources in nine years.But environmentalists don't particularly like hydroelectricity, since it involves damming up rivers. In fact, they've successfully pushed to have many existing hydroelectric dams torn down. Unless this outlook suddenly changes, hydropower's share of energy isn't going to budge. In fact, the EIA expects it to be flat for the next 40 years.How about nuclear? Even if the government decided to go whole hog for nuclear, it wouldn't make any difference over the next decade. The permitting, construction and approval process alone would take more than nine years. And that's assuming environmentalists don't oppose such a plant every step of the way.Nuclear industry officials say they expect just five new reactors to enter service by 2020, and some of that supply will just replace plants that are aging out of service. The youngest nuclear power plant in the United States — Tennessee's Watts Bar 1 — is 20 years old.As a result, the EIA forecasts that nuclear-powered energy production will be roughly the same in 2025 as it is today.So that pretty much leaves wind, solar and biomass. But production levels from these sources would have to increase something like 470% in nine years for clean energy to account for half of the nation's energy production.Then, of course, there's the question of whether our neighbors to the north and south would live up to any promise they make this year.Is Mexico really going to strap on a clean energy millstone to its still-developing and always-struggling economy? And while Canada's leftist leader, Justin Trudeau, might think it's cool to set such goals, it's not clear Canadians will agree to suffer for his current obsession.For a guy who is desperately fishing around for something to claim as a legacy, President Obama's running around making promises that he knows will never be kept is an odd way to go about things.

"
156,HOG,"As a national sales-tax hike loomed in early 2014, Japanese shoppers rushed to purchase expensive items and whatever they could stockpile. Mitsuko Itoh, a Tokyo pediatrician, bought a laptop but resisted the urge to hoard toilet paper, though she said she knew plenty of people who did. She saw stores selling completely out of one surprising item: plastic bags for municipal garbage collection.
"
157,HOG,"The sales-tax hike — Japan's first since 1997 — from a 5% rate to 8%, is the biggest test so far of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's economic reforms. Abe took office in December 2012 with an ambitious pledge to drag Japan out of two decades of deflation, starting with a massive monetary easing by the Bank of Japan (BoJ).
"
158,HOG,"Abenomics depends on monetary policy because fiscal initiatives would likely have very little effect. Japan's aging population, highest-in-the-world levels of accumulated debt, and rebuilding costs from the 2011 nuclear disaster mean that substantial government spending would be tricky.
"
159,HOG,"The tax hike will tackle some of those costs. It will also boost consumer prices and prove to consumers that prices will go up, not down, prompting them to buy now rather than later, and breaking the deflationary spiral.
"
160,HOG,"But analysts worry that demand may stall so badly that the economy will slip into recession.
"
161,HOG,"Now, The Hard Part
"
162,HOG,"Q1 GDP data released last week bolstered that fear. The economy surged at an annualized 5.9%, even faster than expected, as shoppers like Itoh poured into stores. After such a strong quarter, a comedown is almost certain. The focus now shifts to activity in the second half of the year.
"
163,HOG,"Crucially, some economists believe that the easy tasks of Abenomics are now done, and next steps, like the tax hike and a second one expected in 2015, will become harder politically and may contract the economy.
"
164,HOG,"The limited data released since taxes rose show a clear price impact. The corporate goods price index, which tracks wholesale prices, popped in April, the government said, rising 4.1% on the year after 1.7% in March. And a preliminary April consumer price index for Tokyo excluding fresh food rose 2.7%, more than double the 1.3% increase in March.
"
165,HOG,"April Showers
"
166,HOG,"Gauging how the increase is rippling through the economy is harder, though. The government's closely followed Economy Watchers Survey, a broad index of the economic sentiment of people such as restaurant staff and hotel workers, plummeted to 41.6 in April from an all-time high of 57.9 in March. Its long-term average is 44.
"
167,HOG,"The Markit financial-information firm's gauge of service companies saw business activity in that sector plunge at the fastest rate in years, while new business declined for the first time in nine months. Markit's composite output index, which includes manufacturing, sank to 46.3 from 52.8.
"
168,HOG,"Yet Markit found that business expectations among service companies touched the highest point since September 2013, as businesses expect economic conditions and a firming employment situation to drive more activity.
"
169,HOG,"Many analysts, such as Allen Sinai, chief global economist for Decision Economics, have long expected a contraction in Q2.
"
170,HOG,"Sinai, who has advised Japan's government on economic policy, has enthusiastically supported Abenomics. But the tax increase's knock-on effects have darkened his view. ""Consumers haven't really let go of the cautious attitude they had before,"" he said. ""It takes a lot when Japan has gone through two decades of such terrible results, and consumers have been so cautious in consumption and investments. That kind of pattern doesn't get shaken off easily.""
"
171,HOG,"Sinai's forecasts for inflation, 1.2% by the end of 2014, match those from the central bank. Set against an official inflation target of 2%, Sinai said, ""they're more than halfway there. The Bank of Japan will look at it as satisfactory progress has been made.""
"
172,HOG,"But a broader assessment of the economy calls for more stimulus quickly, he said. ""Current account deficits, weak exports, slow growth, slow demand, clearly say the currency is too high. To me, it's absolutely crystal-clear.""
"
173,HOG,"Sinai admits to impatience with the government's deliberate pace in enacting fiscal policies. By not going whole-hog immediately, he thinks, the government may miss its chance to jolt the economy out of deflation for good. ""The whole history of Japan is they've put in policy way too late,"" Sinai said.
"
174,HOG,"The BoJ was set to release a policy statement Tuesday morning.
"
175,HOG,"Other analysts, like PNC Senior International Economist Bill Adams, think that given some time, Abenomics' promise will play out as predicted. Japan's labor market is tight, Adams notes, and some firms have offered wage increases in response to both market forces and pleas from Abe. ""A virtuous cycle of wage increases fueling consumer spending fueling more demand is the classic way for an advanced economy to grow,"" he said.
"
176,HOG,"Adams is keeping an eye on spending by businesses rather than consumers. He expects firms to look past the temporary choppiness following the tax hike and adopt a long-term outlook that assumes economic growth based on their spending. Businesses were responsible for much of the upside surprise in GDP in Q1, increasing spending by 4.9% on the quarter.
"
177,HOG,"The yen has tumbled 18% vs. the dollar since the start of Abenomics, but that hasn't helped exports, which rose only 1.8% on the year as of March. It has helped Japanese corporations such as Toyota (TM) book record profits, and Abe hopes that the profits help to make a case for wage hikes.
"
178,HOG,"Third Arrow
"
179,HOG,"Abe took office promising not just fiscal changes but also structural reforms that would address anachronisms in Japan's economy. Participation in the Trans-Pacific Partnership international trade agreement is a big part of what's known as ""the third arrow,"" but it requires concessions from the country's powerful agricultural and other vested interests. Health care is another component of the third arrow, as is more participation by female workers.
"

182,HOG,"The Abe Indicator
"
183,HOG,"Another fear is that Abe — who enjoyed robust support for the first months of his tenure — may be losing the confidence of his constituents. After decades of a revolving door in Japanese leadership, including an earlier turn by Abe himself, the prime minister's ambition and personal dynamism are widely considered key to jump-starting the economy, and his popularity is watched almost as closely as economic indicators.
"
184,HOG,"But most ordinary Japanese understand that some of the prime minister's policy prescriptions may be tough to swallow, Itoh said. ""I am in favor of Abenomics, I hope it gets successful."" In addition to being a doctor, Itoh is trained as an interpreter and has worked for Abe a few times. ""When you interpret for someone, you get to feel their aura,"" she said. ""He is very active, very aggressive, and he seems to have a good nature.""
"
185,HOG,"Itoh said that she thinks reforms shouldn't be pushed off any longer. ""They should be done not in haste, but in a good pace,"" she said.
"
186,HOG,"Abe himself provides a living example of how such reforms can bring positive change. For years, he suffered from ulcerative colitis and could control it only with the help of an American drug. Pharmaceutical approvals in Japan traditionally took far longer than in most countries, and a reinvigorated Abe wants to stop that ""drug lag,"" so people like him can benefit, Itoh said.As a national sales-tax hike loomed in early 2014, Japanese shoppers rushed to purchase expensive items and whatever they could stockpile. Mitsuko Itoh, a Tokyo pediatrician, bought a laptop but resisted the urge to hoard toilet paper, though she said she knew plenty of people who did. She saw stores selling completely out of one surprising item: plastic bags for municipal garbage collection.The sales-tax hike — Japan's first since 1997 — from a 5% rate to 8%, is the biggest test so far of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's economic reforms. Abe took office in December 2012 with an ambitious pledge to drag Japan out of two decades of deflation, starting with a massive monetary easing by the Bank of Japan (BoJ).Abenomics depends on monetary policy because fiscal initiatives would likely have very little effect. Japan's aging population, highest-in-the-world levels of accumulated debt, and rebuilding costs from the 2011 nuclear disaster mean that substantial government spending would be tricky.The tax hike will tackle some of those costs. It will also boost consumer prices and prove to consumers that prices will go up, not down, prompting them to buy now rather than later, and breaking the deflationary spiral.But analysts worry that demand may stall so badly that the economy will slip into recession.Now, The Hard PartQ1 GDP data released last week bolstered that fear. The economy surged at an annualized 5.9%, even faster than expected, as shoppers like Itoh poured into stores. After such a strong quarter, a comedown is almost certain. The focus now shifts to activity in the second half of the year.Crucially, some economists believe that the easy tasks of Abenomics are now done, and next steps, like the tax hike and a second one expected in 2015, will become harder politically and may contract the economy.The limited data released since taxes rose show a clear price impact. The corporate goods price index, which tracks wholesale prices, popped in April, the government said, rising 4.1% on the year after 1.7% in March. And a preliminary April consumer price index for Tokyo excluding fresh food rose 2.7%, more than double the 1.3% increase in March.April ShowersGauging how the increase is rippling through the economy is harder, though. The government's closely followed Economy Watchers Survey, a broad index of the economic sentiment of people such as restaurant staff and hotel workers, plummeted to 41.6 in April from an all-time high of 57.9 in March. Its long-term average is 44.The Markit financial-information firm's gauge of service companies saw business activity in that sector plunge at the fastest rate in years, while new business declined for the first time in nine months. Markit's composite output index, which includes manufacturing, sank to 46.3 from 52.8.Yet Markit found that business expectations among service companies touched the highest point since September 2013, as businesses expect economic conditions and a firming employment situation to drive more activity.Many analysts, such as Allen Sinai, chief global economist for Decision Economics, have long expected a contraction in Q2.Sinai, who has advised Japan's government on economic policy, has enthusiastically supported Abenomics. But the tax increase's knock-on effects have darkened his view. ""Consumers haven't really let go of the cautious attitude they had before,"" he said. ""It takes a lot when Japan has gone through two decades of such terrible results, and consumers have been so cautious in consumption and investments. That kind of pattern doesn't get shaken off easily.""Sinai's forecasts for inflation, 1.2% by the end of 2014, match those from the central bank. Set against an official inflation target of 2%, Sinai said, ""they're more than halfway there. The Bank of Japan will look at it as satisfactory progress has been made.""But a broader assessment of the economy calls for more stimulus quickly, he said. ""Current account deficits, weak exports, slow growth, slow demand, clearly say the currency is too high. To me, it's absolutely crystal-clear.""Sinai admits to impatience with the government's deliberate pace in enacting fiscal policies. By not going whole-hog immediately, he thinks, the government may miss its chance to jolt the economy out of deflation for good. ""The whole history of Japan is they've put in policy way too late,"" Sinai said.The BoJ was set to release a policy statement Tuesday morning.Other analysts, like PNC Senior International Economist Bill Adams, think that given some time, Abenomics' promise will play out as predicted. Japan's labor market is tight, Adams notes, and some firms have offered wage increases in response to both market forces and pleas from Abe. ""A virtuous cycle of wage increases fueling consumer spending fueling more demand is the classic way for an advanced economy to grow,"" he said.Adams is keeping an eye on spending by businesses rather than consumers. He expects firms to look past the temporary choppiness following the tax hike and adopt a long-term outlook that assumes economic growth based on their spending. Businesses were responsible for much of the upside surprise in GDP in Q1, increasing spending by 4.9% on the quarter.The yen has tumbled 18% vs. the dollar since the start of Abenomics, but that hasn't helped exports, which rose only 1.8% on the year as of March. It has helped Japanese corporations such as Toyota (TM) book record profits, and Abe hopes that the profits help to make a case for wage hikes.Third ArrowAbe took office promising not just fiscal changes but also structural reforms that would address anachronisms in Japan's economy. Participation in the Trans-Pacific Partnership international trade agreement is a big part of what's known as ""the third arrow,"" but it requires concessions from the country's powerful agricultural and other vested interests. Health care is another component of the third arrow, as is more participation by female workers.As the economy's immediate needs demanded Abe's attention, the reforms slipped to the back burner. That's where they should stay, Sinai says. Abe can't let reform attempts impact the economy in the short term, he argues. ""They are for longer-term purposes.""But the ideas that have been discussed should benefit the economy, and many analysts think that complaints about their potential drawbacks come from parties with a stake in preserving the status quo.The Abe IndicatorAnother fear is that Abe — who enjoyed robust support for the first months of his tenure — may be losing the confidence of his constituents.

187,HOG,"Tyson Foods (TSN) is slated to disclose fiscal second-quarter earnings early Monday, and investors will be looking to see if the company can post a fourth straight quarter of double-digit earnings growth.The meat, poultry, pork and prepared-foods company is projected to record a 5% increase in revenue to $8.84 billion.Consensus of 10 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters is for earnings per share to leap 75% to 63 cents.Tyson's strong results over the past year have come despite challenges, including fresh outbreaks of bird and hog viruses in China and elsewhere.Not everyone is convinced Tyson can stay on the fast-growth track. BMO Capital Markets on Tuesday downgraded its rating from outperform (buy) to market perform (neutral). The bank cited what it considers Tyson's high valuation. Tyson stock has risen about 56% from a low of 27.33 on Nov. 4.On the company's first-quarter earnings call in late January, CEO Donnie Smith cautioned that Tyson faces headwinds this year.Smith told analysts that although consumers are becoming less defensive in spending, ""I don't know of anyone who thinks that consumers will go back to their pre-2008 spending habits any time soon.""Investors will look for clues on current pricing trends in the company's earnings report.""Record high beef prices should continue through 2014,"" offsetting lower consumption, Smith said earlier this year. ""Pork prices will also remain high due to lower supply. Chicken should continue to be the winner.""Allianz Global Investors analyst Bryan Agbabian said in a report Wednesday that Tyson is a solid play on the increase in demand for chickens in the U.S. and globally, especially in China, the world's largest consumer market.""Tyson is developing an in-country, in-China integrated production of chicken so that Tyson can then sell to not only the local market there, but also to the U.S.-based restaurants that are doing business there such as (Yum Brands (YUM)-owned) Kentucky Fried Chicken and McDonald's (MCD),"" Agbabian said in the report.Tyson shares were up nearly 1% in Friday afternoon trading in the stock market. Its stock price hit an all-time high 44.01 on March 31 and has consolidated since in sync with a market correction.Among other large meat producers, highly rated Hormel Foods (HRL) was unchanged. Hormel sports a 92 IBD Composite Rating, which means it has outperformed 92% of all stocks on key metrics such as sales and profit growth in recent quarters.Fresh and frozen chicken products-maker Sanderson Farms (SAFM) climbed more than 2%. It boasts a 97 Composite Rating.Prepared- and fresh-chicken company Pilgrim's Pride (PPC) jumped 6% on bullish comments by CEO Bill Lovette during an earnings call with analysts Thursday.Follow James DeTar on Twitter: @IBD_JDeTar

200,HOG,"Hedge funds are loading up with pork.With Americans expected to eat the most pork since 2007, money managers are now the most bullish since 2014 on hog futures, which already are at a nine-month high. Fast-food restaurant owners like McDonald’s (MCD) are selling more bacon, and the price of pork bellies used to make the rashers has surged 30% this year.Demand at home and abroad is rising faster than U.S. farmers are boosting output. Pork remains a cheaper alternative to beef cuts that last year surged to records as supply shrank, government data show. Hog futures for settlement in June are up 16% since mid-November, more than almost every other commodity, including gold.“You have to be bullish in the near term,” said Donald Selkin, chief market strategist at broker-dealer National Securities Corp. in New York, who helps manage about $3 billion. “Exports have been strong, that’s what’s driving this.”The net-long position in hog futures and options jumped 20% to 51,505 contracts in the most recent week, the biggest gain in more than a month, according to Commodity Futures and Trading Commission data. Holdings have surged sixfold since mid-December and expanded in 13 of the past 14 weeks.Futures for June settlement, the most actively traded hog contract, fell 1.9% to 82.275 cents a pound at 11:16 a.m. Monday on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Prices are 12% higher than a year earlier. April futures, which had been the most active until March 8, are trading at 69.775 cents a pound Monday, up 18% since mid-November.In a March 16 report, financial services firm Societe Generale SA raised its second-quarter forecast by 16%, predicting that the front-month contract would average 78.9 cents, compared with 69.4 cents so far this year for the April contract.U.S. hog producers have been expanding after futures surged to a record in 2014, when a piglet-killing virus reduced the domestic herd. Pork production last year was the highest ever and is forecast to increase 2.1% in 2016, U.S. Department of Agriculture data show.But people are eating more pork. On average, Americans will consume 50.4 pounds this year, the USDA said on March 9. And more meat is getting shipped overseas.U.S. exports in January were 10% higher than a year earlier, and shipments have averaged 13% above year-earlier levels every month since September, government data show. They exceed the USDA’s full-year increase forecast of 3.2%.Even with the recent rally in prices, beef’s premium to pork is more than 50% above the 10-year average, and wholesale pork is well below its five-year average.More fast-food restaurants are promoting breakfast items all day that feature pork products, said Dennis Smith, Chicago-based senior account executive at Archer Financial Services. As the cost of ground beef slips from recent records, burgers are making a comeback and restaurants are adding bacon as a topping, said David Maloni, principal at the American Restaurant Association in Sarasota, Florida. Wholesale pork bellies are up 88% from a year earlier at $1.3428 a pound, USDA data show.Not all pork items are rallying. Easter hams are priced to sell, dropping 11% since the end of January to 52.05 cents a pound, USDA data show. Bacon fetches a premium to ham that is more than 60% above the five-year average.Rising pork supplies could end the rally, with the increase in hogs overwhelming processing plants later this year. Farmers tend to boost output in the second half of the year.“There’s definitely a good cause to be bullish through the third quarter, but be very careful in the fourth quarter,” said Will Sawyer, an Atlanta-based vice president for Rabobank Food & Agribusiness Research and Advisory. Processing all the hogs “could come at a price that’s less than what futures are showing today,” he said.

The Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 picked up 0.7% each.The stock market today benefited from a positive mood started in Asia. China's March exports surged 12% from a a year ago, the first rise in eight months, according to the General Administration of Customs. Imports declined less than 8%, vs. a 14% drop in February. The export improvement was partially due to a sharp drop in exports in March 2015. Strong exports were also helped by a weaker yuan.Hong Kong's Hang Seng index responded with a 3.2% gain. The Shanghai Composite climbed 1.4%. In Japan, the yen continued lower against the dollar, helping send the Nikkei 225 ahead 2.8%.The positive tone carried over into Europe, where markets pushed strong gains in afternoon trade.

London's FTSE 100 showed a 1.4% gain.The overseas momentum helped compensate for the drag caused by oil and gold, both of which traded briskly lower. West Texas Intermediate traded down 1%, but held firmly above $41 a barrel. Gold futures were off nearly 1% to $1,250 an ounce.In U.S. economic news, inflation received a tame report card, as producer prices eased 0.1% in March, the Labor Department estimated, well below the 0.3% increase expected by consensus forecasts. Declines in cost of services apparently offset rebounding energy prices. Core prices, minus energy and food, also dipped 0.1%, vs. forecasts for a 0.2% increase.Retail sales also dropped in March, down 0.3%, Commerce Department data showed. Consensus expectations called for a 0.1% increase. Minus automobiles, sales rose 0.2% -- below the consensus estimate for a 0.4% gain.The Census Bureau offers up February business inventories data at 10 a.m. ET, followed by the Energy Information Administration's weekly oil inventories report at 10:30.

Bank of America (BAC), Wells Fargo (WFC) and PNC Financial Services (PNC) -- all scheduled to report results on Thursday -- rose 2% apiece. Overseas banks were also in serious motion: Germany's Deutsche Bank (DB) leapt 6%, London-based HSBC Holdings (HSBC) swung up 5%.

204,HOG,"So yesterday Janet came out swinging - admitting that the world is on the edge or a recession saying:""Given the risks to the outlook, I consider it appropriate for the committee to proceed cautiously in adjusting policy.....the key is that the global economic and financial backdrop looms more threateningly now than before.........and even though officials expect the US economy to weather any further rough patches, the dangers can't be ignored""Let me be clear - she did NOT give any details on timing whatsoever and now the feeling is that if we get any rate rise at all - it will just ONE and it may not be in June....So we can forget all the chatter about 'multiple increases'.... and should the economy take a turn for the worse - she assured the invitees that the FED could still take steps to resuscitate the economy - think 'forward guidance' (which is just another word for Jawboning - which is what she did yesterday as she 'guided' expectations), the other trick up her sleeve would be the launch of an ECB style bazooka..... but either way - she put the idea of any increase to bed and she essentially told the 5 non-compliant FED mouthpieces to 'assume the position' and prepare to get spanked for insinuating last week that rates are due to rise in April -.......And the mkt roared! Investors and traders immediately hit the BUY button on their computers sending the S&P up 17 pts or 0.8% and the Dow up 97 pts or 0.6%.....Remember - last week - CNBC.com ran with a headline article about how ""Fed Chair Yellen has a mini revolt on her hands"" as 5 FED presidents took to the airwaves to suggest that the FED was falling behind the curve and that the mkt (and investors) should expect rates to rise in April. Now it appears that Janet was not happy about that development - And whether or not there is a bit of dissension in the ranks - as the French proverb goes: ""Il faut laver son linge sale en famille"" ......or ""Never wash your dirty laundry in public"".... and that is what they were doing.......washing their 'dirty laundry' for all to see in the name of 'transparency'. And what does that transparency show - it shows a complete mess within the ranks as no one really knows what to do....so staying the course appears to be the best answer for now.....Oh boy.....this story gets more interesting as the hours tick by.....I am beginning to re-think this whole transparency issue - Is it in fact the best thing for the mkts? Does it create more angst and instability for investors and traders? Would Paul Volker ever run the FED like this? (A: NO) Does the FED secretly want more instability to keep everyone guessing? As far as I am concerned - they can do what they want 'behind closed doors' but once they open those doors and the FED chair speaks then that should be it. Period the end. Whatever happened to loyalty? This business of then letting everyone in the FED run hog wild over any network that will have them is getting a bit exhausting. Because in the end - what does it really accomplish besides mass confusion and mkt instability? It is not helpful for investors nor businesses that are trying to plan for the future - it also does not help the individual as he/she plans for the future. The constant sense of angst concerning (global) monetary policy is unnecessary - and quite honestly has created a global monster...Just look around the world and tell me what you see....I think the worst part of all this is what are we really talking about? 25 bps?

(But that was a different time......Ronald Reagan was president and America was on the verge of an incredible resurgence...)Once again - let's point out how legislators have done zero to assist the FED by being creative and pro-active with fiscal policy....But that's another story - one that we see unfolding right in front of us via the Presidential election......People are disgusted and rightly so.....Does anyone in DC understand that?Overnight - stocks rallied - (duh), credit mkts rallied, commodities (think oil) rallied and the dollar continued to slide lower - extending its worst month in 5 yrs. The VIX also moved lower - sliding 9% taking it to its lowest level of the year.....what does this mean? It means that there is a fair amount of complacency in the mkt - no real sense of fear...of course not - Janet has once again tucked it tightly in bed - kissing it on the head, saying 'Mommy loves you... now go to sleep'..... and this is right in front of what is expected to be a weak earnings season.... so the plot thickens.Stocks in Asia and Europe shot higher on the news....with the exception of Japan that got hit with a huge drop in Industrial Production - sending the Nikkei down 1.5%. Hong Kong +2.15%, China + 2.77% and the ASX +0.1%.European mkts following in lock step with Asia and the US....FTSE +1.7%, CAC 40 + 1.9%, DAX + 1.7%, EUROSTOXX +1.6%, SPAIN +1.5% and ITALY + 1.45%US Futures are up another 11 pts in pre-mkt trading......taking the futures index up to 2060.....which will send the cash index up to 2067 if this holds.....I suspect that 2075 should be another level of resistance - but anything is possible now.... Eco data today includes Mort Apps which fell by 1%, and the ADP employment report which is due to show an increase of something approaching +195k jobs.....We will be entertained by one FED speaker today.....Chicago's own Charlie Evans.....(an admitted DOVE). He will be on CNBC Squawk box at 8:30 just after the ADP release, he will also be speaking at the Forecasters Club of NY at 1 pm.Remember that this is end of month and qtr...so a rally would do so many people so much good - especially ahead of April 15th....(Tax day)..... Either way -Take Good Care

207,HOG,"So with little else to go on…the mkt churned – moved back and forth in a very tight range to end the day slightly higher as it digested Friday's move in the face of what is sure to be a busy 'Central Bank' week........expect lots of information, monetary policy decisions and speculation on behalf of traders around the world.Oil came under new pressure as oil investors/traders focused on the noise coming out of Tehran…..You see - Iranian officials reminded the world that they would NOT be joining the other members of the oil producing nations in capping production – or at least not until they grow their exports to 4 million barrels/day. So the March OPEC meeting is now seen as a non-event as investors look towards the April meeting for any action. As a result – Oil backed off and energy names/oil service stocks were weak.Next up - Gold! Gold has been seeing some profit taking – after its 22% surge since late December......Over the past couple of days - we have seen the trader types take about 4% out of the commodity as they 'ring cash register' and put the cash on the sidelines ahead of what could be a volatile week.Now while the mkt did not 'fall out of bed' – the choppy trading does remind us that there are 4 central bank policy meetings/decisions/conversations happening this week. With the FED's monetary policy decision only hours away now….investors/traders/asset managers must also consider the impact of policy decisions coming out of the BoE (Bank of England), SNB ( Swiss National Bank) and the BoJ (Bank of Japan) this week. (This morning we found out that the BoJ as expected left rates unchanged AND downgraded their outlook on the Japanese economy - not good). Now while the majority of analysts/strategists/traders do not expect a move in US rates- they will be paying very close attention to the statement. Will we continue to see this 'central bank divergence'* or will the FED come to its senses at his time of continued global economic weakness?[*Central bank divergence - think US raising rates while the other major central banks are moving to negative rates.]As Bob Doll - Sr Portfolio Manager at Nuveen Asset Management points out:""They're going to be careful in how they say they're not done raising interest rates""So expect the rumors and speculation to heat up.....did she say 'definitely in June'? Did she tease and suggest that April or May are a possibility? Could she raise more than 1/4 of point - yes.....but did she intimate that she would? Is the recent run up in oil enough to change the course of the conversation? Is oil really expected to keep going up in light of all the supply that still exists?Now yesterday - we talked about how producers will come back on line as the price of oil moves higher....in fact - the WSJ ran with the article detailing the facts....and this morning - like clockwork they feature a headline article suggesting that:""Many Shale Producers are Unable to Ramp Up Oil Output""......And why?Well first - many of them are broke (I think they used the words 'financially strapped'), they have sent thousands of workers to the unemployment line (estimates suggest 110k+) and they have idled so much equipment (estimates say 60%+) that they can't very easily bring it back on line with no one to man the equipment.....and even IF prices should rally back to $50/barrel or greater - many of these companies are vowing to 'take it slow'......so there is your contra argument for the supply/demand argument.....after getting burned badly - do not expect the producers to run hog wild even if prices appear to be firming.....that being said - I do not see any reason for prices to move much higher than the low $40's at best.....although they will use the 'spring/summer driving season' as a reason for prices to move higher! I guess it just depends on who is screaming the loudest....Will it be Goldman Sachs (GS)? JP Morgan (JPM)? Citigroup (C)? Royal Bank of Canada (RY)? Morgan Stanley (MS)?......Now I have mentioned a number of times that the mkt has gone right to major resistance over the past month – helped by the move in Oil, the improving sense that maybe the US can weather the latest storm, the prospect of more stimulus coming from a range of central banks – think ECB, BoJ and PBoC – along with the renewed assumptions that the FED will hold steady……. All of this has helped to restore some sense of calm and confidence in the mkts.(Confidence about central bank policy - I remind you - can be short lived and we are about to find out just how US and global investors really feel about Janet's plan moving forward.)Many will look to tie yesterday's lack of action to the weakness in oil – I am not one of those…..now maybe you can tie the weakness in oil and the energy sector to the Iranians – but it is difficult to tie those statements to much else…I mean think about it.....do consumer staples, healthcare, housing, or financials really care about what the Iranians say or do when it comes to oil? Not so much.....I mean it's the Iranians - not the Saudi's......Let's not get carried away......Yes – inflammatory comments conveniently allow for some profit taking by traders in segments of the mkt that have enjoyed a recent run up off of the lows of February but if the mkt has really changed its tune – then we should continue to see the break between oil and the broader mkt as the focus returns to the health of the US & global economy and global monetary policy.Overnight saw global mkts back off on renewed commodity weakness and cautious central bank statements. Longer term investors now sitting back and traders turning a bit cautious after the recent run up in mkts and as the focus returns to global monetary policy....The BoJ as noted has started the conversation and it was NOT bullish.....Japan - 0.68%, Hong Kong - 0.72%, China +0.3% and ASX -1.43%European mkts are also under pressure as they react to the renewed commodity weakness...copper mining company - Antofagasta plunging 10% after reporting full yr pre-tax profits fell by 83% and cancelling their 4th qtr dividend. FTSE -0.69%, CAC 40 - 09.95%, DAX - 0.49%, Eurostoxx - 0.82%, Spain -1.27% and Italy - 0.94%US futures are down 10 pts in early trading - piercing S&P 2000.....Lots going on in the US today...... there are several key economic reports due this morning: Retail Sales, PPI and the Empire State Manufacturing Survey. In addition it is another 'Super Tuesday' in the political arena......Ohio and Florida are the Brass Rings and could well set the stage for what many now expect to be the tickets......Trump vs. Clinton.......Splinter far right and far left organizations continue to try and disrupt the process - but in the end democracy will prevail and Americans will get what they voted for - just as we have all endured 8 yrs of the Obama administration.....maybe it is time for a change..... I'm just sayin.......Let's discuss....But, the “main attraction ” is still the FOMC Rate Decision due out in 35 hrs.....and again it is not the decision (no hike) but rather the message that she delivers that will become the catalyst for the next move..... I continue to believe that our upper range will be confined to the 2020 area while the downside could see us test 1975 if we are not able to hold at S&P 2000. In the end though - no one should be surprised at all - UNLESS she completely backs off of any rate hike at all....(0% chance of that). So the trader types should get ready for the volatility while the long term investors should place their bets and line the book on the way down to scoop up any knee jerk reaction......Take Good Care

209,HOG,"Bulked up with acquisitions along with favorable financial results, Hormel Foods is whetting the appetite of investors seeking juicy returns.The stars are aligned in favor of Hormel (HRL) on a few fronts. Low hog prices in its core pork business have helped lift profit margins. Demand for protein products is strong.Plus, Hormel has made a number of acquisitions that have broadened its reach, such as the 2015 purchase of Applegate Farms, the No. 1 brand in the natural and organic value-added prepared meats category. The buy has helped the company tap into growing demand for natural and organic foods from millennials to aging baby boomers, and expanded its retail channel scope.Add to that double-digit profit gains in all but one of the past 10 quarters and you have a tasty recipe for success for the maker of Skippy peanut butter, Spam lunch meats and Jennie-O Turkey. Hormel has seen its stock price soar more than 45% since its Sept. 22 low of 29.93. After a recent breakout, it now hovers in the low 40s.""The stock is performing well,"" S&P Global Market Intelligence analyst Joseph Agnese told Investor’s Business Daily, noting he has a hold rating on the stock. ""The commodity environment overall is very favorable with feed costs very low for the turkeys they raise and prices for hogs are down significantly. And they’re very well positioned in the food market (where there’s) strong demand for protein.""BB&T Capital Markets analyst Heather Jones added: ""A key driver of earnings upside and, thereby, the shares has been very significant margin expansion primarily driven by favorable input cost trends in their core pork business, their biggest segment, which sells fresh pork; bacon; pepperoni, etc. into retail and food service; and in their grocery products business with products like Spam.""Although Hormel’s turkey business was negatively impacted by the avian flu last year, it did a ""phenomenal"" job shifting products and selling them at a high margin as a result, Jones added.Recent acquisitions have helped buoy results. They include the $700 million purchase of the Skippy peanut butter business from Unilever (UL) in 2013 and the $450 million purchase of CytoSport Holdings, the maker of Muscle Milk products in 2014.Its latest buy, the $775 million purchase of Applegate Farms, was Hormel’s biggest to date.""The acquisition was perfectly aligned with our interest in adding brands that resonate with consumers that are younger and more socially engaged,"" said Chairman and Chief Executive Jeffrey Ettinger on the first-quarter conference call with analysts. ""This acquisition has also expanded our distribution into the natural and specialty foods channel that’s provided a faster path to creating a significant presence in this high growth, high margin segment.""Jones says the acquisition will help the bottom line.""But what’s important is the acknowledgment that a certain segment of the population is now focused upon where their food is coming from and how those animals were raised,"" she told IBD. ""The wellness trend, in a holistic sense, is not going away. To change a culture and build a brand and credibility in that space would have taken a lot of time and money. It was more expedient to buy a company in that space than to do it on a greenfield basis.""Agnese says, however, the Applegate buy wasn’t a game changer as much as a milestone marking where Hormel is headed.""The game changer is the company has shifted to making acquisitions of value-added products to diversify away from the historical pork and turkey commodity business and more toward a diversified packaged foods company with more stability,"" he added. ""With wider margins and more stability comes a bigger valuation multiple.""Applegate’s products are sold mostly through natural and organic foods specialty stores such as Whole Foods Market (WFM) while Hormel products are sold through traditional outlets.""Hormel can leverage the newly acquired relationship (with Applegate) to try to sell products in the natural and organic foods specialty channel,"" said Agnese. Having the Applegate brand under its umbrella will help Hormel sell products like Muscle Milk and the Hormel brands in the specialty channel, he adds.Hormel has been serving up some tasty financial results, though not all has gone smoothly. For its fiscal 2016 first quarter ended Jan. 24, earnings climbed 23% from a year earlier to 43 cents a share. Profits were up in all segments except its Jennie-O Turkey Store, which saw operating profit slip 2% from a year earlier as it continued to recover from the impact of the highly pathogenic bird flu that hit Hormel farms in Wisconsin and Minnesota midway through 2015, the company said.Total company revenue for the quarter fell 4% to $2.3 billion. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect full-year earnings to rise 18% to $1.56 a share. They see a 5% gain in 2017 and a 9% rise in 2018.Agnese expects full-year 2016 revenue to rise 4.7% from 2015, on benefits from recent acquisitions, including Applegate Farms, he noted in a report. He estimates Applegate sales will total over $350 million in 2016.In a recent report to clients, Jones projected “relatively modest” earnings growth in 2017.""Barring a sizeable acquisition, we have difficulty discerning what factors could drive more substantial earnings growth,"" she noted.But Jones told IBD she expects Hormel to do more acquisitions.""I think they're very disciplined allocators of capital,"" she said. ""I don’t think they'll do an acquisition just to grow. It has to fit into their strength and it has to be the right price. They have challenges in growing volumes in their core business and have an excellent balance sheet. I think they'll do more acquisitions over the next few years.""

210,HOG,"Harley-Davidson (HOG) lowered its forecast for 2016 shipments, despite announcing a major marketing and product push late last year.The company now expects to ship 269,000-274,000 motorcycles this year, up roughly 1%-3% from last year. In October, management predicted a 3%-5% increase.Harley-Davidson in October introduced plans to boost its 2016 marketing investment by 65% and product development spending by 35% to draw new consumers.Its most loyal riders, a baby boomer generation that has found itself with more disposable income over the decades, have gotten older while standards of masculinity have changed. The company has launched Street brand motorcycles that are intended to target younger customers, but those bikes typically sell for less.Harley shares closed up 3.8% on the stock market today, after rising as much as 9.8% earlier Thursday.The stock has fallen about 30% over the last year as the company contends with rivals like Polaris (PII) and struggles to attract younger consumers, who have in recent years put off getting driver's licenses and are more likely to view the smartphone, not the open road, as a point of entry into adulthood.In Q4, Harley's earnings per share fell 37% to 22 cents, but that wasn't as bad as the slide to 19 cents that analysts expected. Sales of motorcycles and related products dipped 2% to $1.01 billion, below views for $1.03 billion, according to Thomson Reuters.Retail motorcycle sales fell in most regions during Q4, with Canada and Asia-Pacific being the exceptions.CEO Matt Levatich said in a statement that Harley's U.S. market share had ""stabilized"" as the company began more aggressive marketing efforts and as it ""lapped the initial impact of heightened competitiveness and price discounting that began late in the fourth quarter of 2014.""Shares of Polaris, which makes the Indian motorcycle and all-terrain vehicles, closed down 0.8% Thursday. On Tuesday, it reported disappointing quarterly results, sending shares down 9% that day.Snowmobile maker Arctic Cat (ACAT), which also reported results Thursday, jumped 5.8%.

212,HOG,"When the economy is entering a recession, stocks in consumer staples, health care and telecoms ""are the best places to hide,"" said Barclays' Jonathan Glionna, who names tobacco giants Philip Morris International (PM) and Reynolds American (RAI) and drug giants Merck (MRK) and Pfizer (PFE).Meanwhile, he includes General Electric (GE) among the stocks to buy for a recovery.He doesn't see a recession in the near term, but there are red flags such as the collapse of oil prices, the 10% retreat in the S&P 500 so far this year and slowing growth in global No. 2 economy China.In a report Monday, Glionna joined a growing number of analysts providing lists of recession-resistant stocks. But he took a slightly different tack from others, offering two lists: a Recession Playbook and a Recovery Playbook.Among other top picks on his Recession Playbook are Campbell Soup (CPB), Coca-Cola (KO), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Procter & Gamble (PG) and Hormel Foods (HRL).Philip Morris stock closed up 0.3% Tuesday, and Reynolds American, the maker of Camel cigarettes, added 1.3%. Merck gained 0.7%, and Pfizer rose 1.9%. Campbell Soup climbed 1.7%, while Johnson & Johnson and Procter & Gamble ended flat.Glionna said of his Recovery Playbook: ""The best performing sectors in previous periods of economic recovery -- using the exit of a recession as indicative of a recovery -- have been energy, materials, industrials and consumer discretionary.""Among stocks on that list: Ford Motor (F), General Electric, General Motors (GM), Harley-Davidson (HOG) and Viacom (VIA).Ford ended down 2%, and GM lost 2.8% Tuesday. GE ticked up 0.4%. Harley-Davidson fell 1.5%, and Viacom plunged more than 21% on worse-than-expected results for the December-ended quarter.Meanwhile, Cowen analysts put out their own list of recession stocks Tuesday, saying, ""We believe stocks that appeal to the low-end consumer and have minimal global exposure appear well-suited to weather an economic downturn.""Among their top picks: off-price clothing retailer Ross Stores (ROST) and Wal-Mart Stores (WMT).Ross Stores climbed 2.25%, and Wal-Mart fell 1.6%.

217,HOG,"It might have been the biggest jaw-dropping moment during the State of the Union address. ""We've cut our imports of foreign oil by nearly 60%, and cut carbon pollution more than any other country on Earth,"" President Obama proclaimed. ""Gas under two bucks a gallon ain't bad, either.""Sure, Mr. President. Take a bow for the smashing success of the domestic oil and gas industry you have tried to destroy.But even Obama couldn't carry this one off. The smirk on his face as he sang the praises of an oil and gas industry was unmistakable. This is the man who just two months ago pledged to his pals in the multibillion-dollar climate-change industry that he is committed to shutting down American fossil fuel production.Right after he boasted of these low gas prices, the president reverted back to form:""We've got to accelerate the transition away from dirty energy"" — by which he means fossil fuels. Then the hammer came down: ""I'm going to push to change the way we manage our oil and coal resources, so that they better reflect the costs they impose on taxpayers and our planet.""So 30 seconds after toasting lower gas prices he pledges to find ways to make gas more expensive.Climate Change FanaticThe irony of Obama's war against fossil fuels is that America's shale oil and gas revolution has saved him.During his first term, all the net new jobs created in the U.S. came from oil and gas as fracking took off in Texas, Oklahoma, North Dakota, West Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania. Obama owed his reelection to the frackers, but instead he and his EPA have tried to shut them down.The EPA has issued three regulations in the last year — a clean power plant rule, a methane rule and tougher clean air statutes — that have begun to shut down fossil-fuel production as planned. Arch Coal has filed for bankruptcy, thanks to Obama's climate-change fanaticism.How bad are these rules? According to Harold Hamm of Continental Resources, a major driller in North Dakota: ""These rules and red tape are killing us. They are raising our costs at a time when oil prices are low and margins are already thin. This means layoffs of workers.""Obama seems to be doing exactly what the Saudi oil sheiks are trying to achieve: shut down fracking in America.Meanwhile, Obama won't allow drilling on federal lands or give the go-ahead to the Keystone XL pipeline or any other pipelines. Instead, he wants to raise taxes on oil and gas production and just handed out hundreds of millions of dollars to keep the solar and wind industries from bankruptcy. Other than that, he's pro oil and gas.Cleaned By FreedomThe president also neglected to mention that the major reason why carbon emissions are falling is that cheap and clean-burning natural gas from shale drilling is becoming America's No. 1 source of electricity production. The lesson: free markets and innovation are almost always the best way to clean the environment.If Obama's vision of an American energy future is fulfilled, the price of oil and gas will skyrocket — again. He'd like that to happen because wind and solar companies privately concede it's the only scenario that makes green energy financially feasible.Raising the cost of energy — and particularly gas prices at the pump — will be a gut punch to consumers. Motorists are saving about $500 a year from these lower gas prices. It's one of the few positive trends in an otherwise limping economy.One last point about low gas prices. Why when oil prices rise is the entire industry accused of price-fixing to gouge consumers? And if the industry has the monopolistic power to keep prices as high as possible, why isn't it doing that now?The answer is that in the new era of shale oil and gas the industry is brutally price-competitive — unlike in the past when the OPEC was able to fix prices. The cartel can no longer manipulate prices because the U.S. will soon be the world's largest producer. All the more reason to let the domestic oil and gas industry flourish.For now, however, Obama will hog the credit for lower gas prices that he never wanted in the first place while he finds every way possible to make gas more expensive in the years to come.• Moore is a Fox News contributor and a member of the IBD Brain Trust.

219,HOG,"With signs increasingly pointing to a year-over-year decline in iPhone sales for Apple's (AAPL) fiscal year ending next September, the company will need its next-generation smartphone, the iPhone 7, to be a hit in order to reestablish Apple's growth story.That's the assessment of FBR analyst Daniel Ives, who cut his price target on Apple stock to 150 from 175 on Wednesday based on revised iPhone sales targets. He still rates Apple stock as outperform. Ives joins a parade of Wall Street analysts in recent weeks who have cut their forecasts for iPhone shipments and Apple sales and earnings, as well as their stock price targets.On Tuesday, Cowen analyst Timothy Arcuri cut his price target on Apple stock to 130 from 135 on a weaker outlook for the iPhone maker. He reiterated his market perform rating on Apple shares.""It is simply no longer blasphemous to say iPhone units will likely decline year-over-year in calendar 2016,"" Arcuri said in a report. ""Expectations for March have come in a lot, but the builds for March are simply too low to make us feel that Street numbers are safe for fiscal Q3 (June). Ergo, the cycle of estimate cuts probably hasn't flushed itself out yet, making it hard for us to jump back in whole hog.""Ives lowered his iPhone shipment forecasts based on lower-than-expected demand for the iPhone 6S series, Apple's ninth-generation smartphones released in September. The iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus handsets are incremental improvements over the iPhone 6 series, providing such new features as a pressure-sensitive screen and animated photos. The iPhone 6 series was hugely popular, meeting a pent-up demand for larger-screen iPhones.Ives lowered his iPhone shipment forecast to 75.5 million units from 77 million for the December quarter, to 52 million from 60 million in the March quarter, and to 47 million from 51 million for the June quarter.For fiscal 2016, he reduced his iPhone shipment target to 223.5 million units from 243 million. For fiscal 2017, he lowered his unit estimates to 255 million from 259 million.""After a euphoric iPhone 6 product cycle, Apple and (CEO Tim) Cook now face a pivotal 'make or break' iPhone 7 product cycle, which will dictate the future growth story at Apple,"" Ives said.While the iPhone will continue to be the company's main growth engine for the foreseeable future, Apple is focused on other opportunities as well, he said. Those include the Apple Watch, streaming music and video, augmented reality and possibly a car, Ives said.Follow Patrick Seitz on Twitter @IBD_PSeitz and on Facebook.

220,HOG,"In recent weeks, Wall Street analysts have cut their iPhone sales targets for the March quarter on signs of slowing production in Asia. Now those concerns are bleeding into the June quarter.Cowen analyst Timothy Arcuri on Tuesday cut his price target on Apple (AAPL) stock to 130 from 135 on a weaker outlook for the iPhone maker. He rates the stock as market perform. Apple stock was flat, near 107, in afternoon trading on the stock market today.Arcuri said investor expectations for iPhone sales in the March quarter might finally have gotten too bearish, but sales targets for the June quarter still look too high even factoring in the rumored launch of a new 4-inch handset, the iPhone 6C. China Mobile (CHL) has revealed plans to start selling a phone dubbed the iPhone 7C in April, AppleInsider reported Tuesday. The iPhone 7C is another name for the rumored 4-inch iPhone 6C.Arcuri says Apple's iPhone unit sales will be in the low to mid 70 million range in the December quarter and in the low 50 millions for the March quarter.""On this basis, we do not see a material miss for December or guide below for March, particularly in light of investor expectations that have sunk to below 50 million (iPhone units) for March on fears around supply chain data points,"" he said.However, the projected iPhone builds for the March quarter ""are simply too low to make us feel that Street numbers are safe for fiscal Q3 (June),"" he said. ""Ergo, the cycle of estimate cuts probably hasn't flushed itself out yet, making it hard for us to jump back in whole hog.""The launch of the iPhone 6C should provide Apple some cover for the June quarter, but it also is likely to cannibalize some sales of lower-priced iPhone 6 models, Arcuri said.

221,HOG,"Adobe Systems (ADBE) is putting Flash out to pasture. But no one is complaining. That's because the pioneering Web video and animation software lately has become known as the application that always crashes your browser.Adobe announced Monday that it is replacing its Flash Professional product with Adobe Animate CC in early 2016.""For nearly two decades, Flash Professional has been the standard for producing rich animations on the Web,"" Rich Lee, a senior product marketing manager for Adobe's Creative Cloud, said in a blog post. ""Because of the emergence of HTML5 and demand for animations that leverage Web standards, we completely rewrote the tool over the past few years to incorporate native HTML5 Canvas and WebGL support.""Adobe has been de-emphasizing Flash in favor of HTML5 for years as support for the latter has grown. Animate CC will continue to support Flash, which is still used for Web gaming and premium video, the company said.The turning point for Flash occurred in April 2010 when Apple (AAPL) CEO Steve Jobs harshly criticized the software in an open letter. He said that Flash was the No. 1 cause of Mac computer crashes and was not suitable for mobile devices because it was a battery hog. Apple refused to support Flash on its iOS devices such as the iPhone and iPad.Flash also has been knocked for security vulnerabilities.Adobe said that it changed the name of its Web animation software to reflect the importance of open Web standards and HTML5. Today, over a third of all content produced in Flash Professional CC is HTML5-based, the San Jose, Calif.-based company said.Adobe stock rose 1.2% to 92.55 on the stock market today.

231,HOG,"Education: Student activists are getting a lot of press with their calls for free college as a national issue. Call us curmudgeons, but when is someone going to get up and call them the spoiled brats that they are?Waving signs and demanding free tuition at the ""Million Student March"" on Thursday, thousands of students showed how college education has left them astoundingly devoid of economic literacy, most obviously in their inability to grasp that there's nothing so costly as something billed as ""free.""Then on Friday, Fox News host Neil Cavuto, fresh from a stellar performance as moderator at the GOP debates, interviewed student protest leader/community organizer Keely Mullen, who led the ""Million Student March,"" a nationwide call for free tuition at all state universities, student loan forgiveness and a $15 minimum wage.Cavuto's first question was a knockout: ""How's that going to be paid?""""Umm, the 1% of people in society that are hoarding the wealth and kind of causing the catastrophe students are facing,"" Mullen replied, in a response straight out of the blather of Occupy or, more likely, her radical-left professors.Cavuto asked her what would happen if the 1% didn't want to pay that and moved away instead.""If they leave?""""The country.""""Oh. Ummm, I mean, there's always going to be a 1% in the U.S.,"" she replied.Incredible.Technically, Mullen's right. There will always be someone in any group of people in the top 1%.But Mullen showed not an inkling of recognition that the new 1% after the old 1% flee the country might not be worth quite what the people who left were.Desperately trying to draw out some evidence that he wasn't talking to an idiot, Cavuto then explained that the $1 trillion combined total worth of the U.S. super-rich couldn't begin to cover the $1.3 trillion that her plan would entail. She had no coherent answer for him on that either.It all goes to show that any cognizance of actions having consequences — from Mullen as well as Democratic socialist presidential candidates Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton — completely goes over the heads of those calling for free stuff.Call it ""Generation E,"" for entitlement.Granted, tuition costs have risen as the protestors say. But what they fail to recognize is that public spending has soared for education and that this very spending is what has pushed tuition higher than ever.""As with any subsidized product, prices rose to absorb the subsidy,"" Glenn Reynolds explained in his 2014 book ""The New School,"" a substantial study of what he calls the ""higher education bubble.""""For the past several decades, higher education has been living high on the hog,"" he wrote. ""Faculty salaries have grown significantly, and administrative salaries have grown dramatically; seven-figure pay for university presidents isn't even news anymore, and at most schools, there are scores of lower-level officials who still make more money than anyone else on campus except coaches.""It's a bubble, all right, fueled by a flood of federal cash that no longer goes to actual education but to larded-up bureaucracies, spa-like dormitories and ""safe spaces"" to nurse grievances.With all that free stuff going to so many people around them, it's Exhibit A of how higher education has been absorbed by a student population whose only idea of how to fund their vast dreams of entitlement is to tax the rich some more.It's the wretched product of decades of federal spending — accelerated under the Obama administration — shielded from the Economics 101 chestnut, ""There is no free lunch.""It's infuriating not only to see such student ignorance take root in the popular culture but also for the media to portray these self-entitled narcissists as representatives of today's student generation. They aren't.As Reynolds notes in ""The New School,"" many students aren't out there hollering on the barricades for free stuff but quietly studying at demanding majors that will lead to productive jobs and exploring educational alternatives such as online learning, military service, community colleges and trade schools.These students get no publicity, but they're the real revolution.

248,HOG,"George Henry Corliss re-energized the American Industrial Revolution with his slick steam engine. Since James Watt invented the modern steam engine in Britain in the Revolutionary year of 1776, no one had done much to make it less of a coal hog and more reliable as a source of energy.
"
249,HOG,"Some factories preferred water as cheap and dependable. Textile and iron mills distrusted engines because they could go out of control and do damage. Corliss solved these problems, starting in 1849.
"
250,HOG,"""He dominated steam-engine technology in the second half of the 19th century,"" Charles Morris, author of ""The Dawn of Innovation,"" told IBD. ""His first engine patent addressed both fuel consumption and speed regulation as related problems. He marketed his engine by offering customers an option of a fixed price or a percentage of the fuel savings it achieved. Most chose the contingent price and ended up paying much more.""
"
251,HOG,"In addition to his firm's profit, Corliss had earned by 1870 — when his patent expired — royalties of $213,000, worth $3.5 million now.
"
252,HOG,"Corliss (1817-88) was born in Easton, N.Y., near Vermont, the son of a physician.
"
253,HOG,"At 14, after schooling, he worked as a general-store clerk. When the store wasn't busy, he showed mechanical aptitude, inventing a machine to stitch leather shoes, even though he wouldn't see the inside of a machine shop until he was 24.
"
254,HOG,"Teen Titan
"
255,HOG,"At 17, he organized builders to replace a bridge that had washed away.
"
256,HOG,"In 1838, he opened his own general store in Greenwich, N.Y., which he operated for three years.
"
257,HOG,"In 1839, he married Phebe Frost; they had a daughter and a son. Phebe would die in 1859; six years later, he would marry Emily Shaw, who was 18 years his junior.
"
258,HOG,"In 1843, Corliss received a patent for a sewing machine, sold his store and moved his family to the manufacturing center Providence, R.I., hoping to find a sponsor to bankroll his perfecting the machine. Finding no interest, he joined the Fairbanks, Bancroft & Co. machine shop as a draftsman in 1844; within two years, he became a full partner.
"
259,HOG,"Meanwhile, he solved problems with the stationary steam engine that could meet the demands of high-speed manufacturing — as opposed to the engine that was adequate to power steamboats.
"
260,HOG,"In 1848, Corliss entered into a partnership with two investors, John Barstow and E.J. Nightingale, to form Corliss, Nightingale & Co. in Providence, and he made his first improved engine. He received his first patent for it the next year.
"
261,HOG,"""Conventional steam engines used a slide valve that alternately admitted fresh steam into a chamber, causing a piston to move, then discharged the condensation,"" Morris said. ""Corliss estimated that much of the engine's energy was consumed just reheating after the discharge. He separated the intake and discharge valves, which reduced coal consumption 30 to 50%.""
"
262,HOG,"Textile mills were especially concerned with conventional steam engine performance. Threads would often break, and if several looms went down at the same time, the surplus power would shift to the remaining looms, which were already running at high speed, and do them considerable damage.
"
263,HOG,"""This didn't happen often, but when it did, it was very expensive to repair,"" said Morris. ""Corliss invented a clever automatic variable cutoff valve that could tune power output to delicate shifts in demand or, in an emergency, stop an engine very quickly.""
"
264,HOG,"Corliss spent the rest of his life perfecting the engine, receiving 60 patents, according to Frederick Jaggi, president of the New England Wireless & Steam Museum in East Greenwich, R.I., which houses a working Corliss engine.
"
265,HOG,"Corliss and his associates built a factory at the junction of Charles Street and a railroad line in Providence, and expanded it until it covered five acres with 1,000 workers.
"
266,HOG,"It housed four locomotive turnstiles connected to two railroad spurs so that one train could come in to be loaded, then turn to move out while the next was loaded.
"
267,HOG,"""He was the first American to practice extremely precise, ultraheavy, hand-crafted machine manufacture,"" said Morris. ""Every part for every product was made in his own factory. Besides his engines, he made a wide range of heavy machinery and parts, like wheels and shaft casings. His plant could pour single castings up to 32 tons.""
"
268,HOG,"In 1856, he formed Corliss Steam Engine Co., with himself as president and his brother William as treasurer. Three years later, they began exporting to Scotland; Europeans became major customers.
"
269,HOG,"True North
"
270,HOG,"Corliss supplied the Union with machinery during the Civil War.
"
271,HOG,"In 1861, he received a federal order to make a large ring on which a gun turret could revolve for the Monitor, a new type of ship that had a hull of iron.
"
272,HOG,"His factory was one of the few that could cast the ring. He put aside all other work and had the plant run day and night to build it and ship it to New York, where it was placed on the Monitor.
"
273,HOG,"In March 1862, the first combat took place between ironclad ships in the Battle of Hampton Roads. Setting it off, the Confederate navy's iron ram Virginia sank two wooden ships off Norfolk in an attempt to break the Union blockade.
"
274,HOG,"A third, the Minnesota, had run aground, but it was dark, so the Virginia returned to port. The next morning, it went out to finish off the Minnesota, but the Monitor had arrived at night to protect it.
"
275,HOG,"Over the next three hours, they slugged it out, doing only modest damage to each other.
"
276,HOG,"While the blockade stayed in place, the battle turned out to be the war's most important naval engagement. It received global coverage and had an immediate impact, causing major navies to stop building wooden ships and shift to ironclads with the kind of heavy guns that the Monitor had, which could swivel to fire in any direction.
"
277,HOG,"In 1867, two years after war's end, Corliss competed against 100 of the best steam engine makers at the International Exposition in Paris and won first prize.
"
278,HOG,"Long-Distance Praise
"
279,HOG,"One of his rivals, Scott Russell, the British designer of the huge Great Eastern steamship, described the Corliss engine: ""A mechanism as beautiful as a human hand. It releases or retains its grasp on the feeding valve, and gives a greater or less dose of steam in a nice proportion to each varying want.... (It) everywhere tells of wise forethought, judicious proportions, sound execution and exquisite contrivance.""
"
280,HOG,"Three years later, Corliss received the Rumford Prize from the American Academy of Arts & Sciences. The 1870 presentation for making crucial improvements to steam power came a century after Watt received his first patent for a modern engine.
"
281,HOG,"Also in 1870, Corliss' patent expired. Competitors leapt to copy his work, and their products became known as Corliss engines.
"
282,HOG,"One of these knockoffs earned Corliss the Grand Diploma of Honor in 1873 at the Vienna Exposition, though he wasn't there.
"
283,HOG,"In 1872, Corliss became Rhode Island's commissioner to the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia.
"
284,HOG,"It was the same year that America took the lead as the world's top industrial power, with much of its manufacturing run by his engines, according to Time magazine.
"
285,HOG,"When the fair opened four years later, 10 million people from all over the world came to see its 30,000 exhibits. The center of attention was Machinery Hall, which covered 13 acres.
"
286,HOG,"Powering all the hall's devices was the world's largest steam engine, with a shaft 352 feet long and a flywheel weighing 56 tons, which operated almost silently. Corliss paid the massive engine's $100,000 cost (equal to $2.3 million today) out of his own pocket.
"
287,HOG,"Afterward, he sent the engine to Chicago's Pullman Car Works , where it powered multiple machines until 1910.
"
288,HOG,"In the mid-1880s, Corliss closed his plant to turn it into an assembly-line operation, but he died at 72, before he could finish.
"
289,HOG,"The firm was bought by International Power Co. in 1900, then American & British Manufacturing Co. five years later. In 1925, it was merged into Franklin Machine Co.

""Every part for every product was made in his own factory. Besides his engines, he made a wide range of heavy machinery and parts, like wheels and shaft casings. His plant could pour single castings up to 32 tons.""In 1856, he formed Corliss Steam Engine Co., with himself as president and his brother William as treasurer. Three years later, they began exporting to Scotland; Europeans became major customers.True NorthCorliss supplied the Union with machinery during the Civil War.In 1861, he received a federal order to make a large ring on which a gun turret could revolve for the Monitor, a new type of ship that had a hull of iron.His factory was one of the few that could cast the ring. He put aside all other work and had the plant run day and night to build it and ship it to New York, where it was placed on the Monitor.In March 1862, the first combat took place between ironclad ships in the Battle of Hampton Roads. Setting it off, the Confederate navy's iron ram Virginia sank two wooden ships off Norfolk in an attempt to break the Union blockade.A third, the Minnesota, had run aground, but it was dark, so the Virginia returned to port. The next morning, it went out to finish off the Minnesota, but the Monitor had arrived at night to protect it.Over the next three hours, they slugged it out, doing only modest damage to each other.While the blockade stayed in place, the battle turned out to be the war's most important naval engagement. It received global coverage and had an immediate impact, causing major navies to stop building wooden ships and shift to ironclads with the kind of heavy guns that the Monitor had, which could swivel to fire in any direction.In 1867, two years after war's end, Corliss competed against 100 of the best steam engine makers at the International Exposition in Paris and won first prize.Long-Distance PraiseOne of his rivals, Scott Russell, the British designer of the huge Great Eastern steamship, described the Corliss engine: ""A mechanism as beautiful as a human hand. It releases or retains its grasp on the feeding valve, and gives a greater or less dose of steam in a nice proportion to each varying want.... (It) everywhere tells of wise forethought, judicious proportions, sound execution and exquisite contrivance.""Three years later, Corliss received the Rumford Prize from the American Academy of Arts & Sciences. The 1870 presentation for making crucial improvements to steam power came a century after Watt received his first patent for a modern engine.Also in 1870, Corliss' patent expired. Competitors leapt to copy his work, and their products became known as Corliss engines.One of these knockoffs earned Corliss the Grand Diploma of Honor in 1873 at the Vienna Exposition, though he wasn't there.In 1872, Corliss became Rhode Island's commissioner to the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia.It was the same year that America took the lead as the world's top industrial power, with much of its manufacturing run by his engines, according to Time magazine.When the fair opened four years later, 10 million people from all over the world came to see its 30,000 exhibits. The center of attention was Machinery Hall, which covered 13 acres.Powering all the hall's devices was the world's largest steam engine, with a shaft 352 feet long and a flywheel weighing 56 tons, which operated almost silently. Corliss paid the massive engine's $100,000 cost (equal to $2.3 million today) out of his own pocket.Afterward, he sent the engine to Chicago's Pullman Car Works , where it powered multiple machines until 1910.In the mid-1880s, Corliss closed his plant to turn it into an assembly-line operation, but he died at 72, before he could finish.The firm was bought by International Power Co. in 1900, then American & British Manufacturing Co. five years later. In 1925, it was merged into Franklin Machine Co.The National Inventors Hall of Fame inducted Corliss in 2006.

337,HOG,"If you think managing innovation crushes freethinking, think again. The opposite is true: The more you facilitate and streamline creativity, the faster good ideas can make it to market and earn cash.So says innovation expert Steve Uban, the chairman of the Standards Committee at the Product Development and Management Association. That trade group feels so strongly about innovative discipline that it has launched a standard to measure how effectively firms capitalize on their genius.""Some people think innovation standard is sort of an oxymoron: You're not supposed to manage innovation; it's supposed to be free-flowing,"" Uban told IBD.""But we can show, through the research that we do, that when you manage product and service innovation, you get better results.""How much better? ""You get a 90% better return on your investment if you use best practice tools,"" he estimated.The PDMA's International Innovation Management Standard provides benchmarks that executives can use to increase idea flow and product development at any firm. The standard, a result of the group's research into product development by heavyweights such as Harley-Davidson (HOG), DuPont (DD) and Clorox (CLX), is designed to help firms figure out the elements of high-impact innovation.Executives and innovative teams can measure themselves against the standard through a self-assessment or an audit from the PDMA.Adopt these characteristics to capitalize on ingenuity at your firm:• Inventive outlook. At crackerjack-thinking workplaces, ideas come naturally. But there's a strategy to it, Uban explains, and it's not just about buying trendy couches or glow-in-the-dark whiteboards.Think about how chiefs respond to bold thinking or react to flops, the occasional byproduct of sizzling brainstorms.• Patience. ""If risk taking and making mistakes are treated harshly in a company, no matter what you do, you are going to have a cloud over the innovation process,"" Uban noted. ""That will restrict how innovative (employees) are.""• Increased idea volume. The most brilliant firms are constantly brewing their next best-seller. ""How fully loaded is your innovation pipeline?"" Uban asks.You should be stabbing at industry upheavals, he adds, along with tweaking today's top-selling items.• Crunch. You can boost innovation by giving workers the gift of time, Uban teaches, to let their minds wander and scan trends in other industries — to sketch, test and stretch. ""You need to have long-range innovation along with short-term projects,"" he said. ""It's like a balanced portfolio.""• Creative connection. To develop good ideas, every department should embrace innovation.Consider hatching new goals to reward all employees for shepherding strong concepts. You can also retool your budget to reimburse divisions for the time they spend on innovation, Uban says.• Calculated criticism. Give leaders plenty of chances to question and probe potential breakthroughs. But think strategically about when to identify holes in an idea.""You don't want leadership coming in at the end of a project and saying, 'No, this isn't right,'"" Uban explained. ""If they want input, they need to do that at the beginning, before the team gets started.""• Mix and hatch. ""One of the secrets I have found works is this cross-pollination of knowledge between design, engineering and marketing,"" said Robert Hale, PDMA's chairman. ""The OCI (outstanding corporate innovator) award winners always talk about how they cross-pollinate.""

""Many of the current ideas of what it takes to grow a business are borne out of the '80s and '90s, when marketing was not practiced as a science, but based more on anecdotes. The louder practitioners would say this works for me, and what they said took on the status of truth.""
"
346,HOG,"Lindsay says data show that widely held beliefs about what helps a business grow should be challenged. Rethink conventional wisdom and use these strategies to boost your market share:
"
347,HOG,"• Seek new leads. While it's crucial to deliver to your current customers, it's equally key to find new buyers. ""The only way to grow a brand is to increase the number of people who use it,"" Lindsay said.
"
348,HOG,"Some say it's cheaper to spend all your marketing dollars keeping existing clients than trying to find new customers. Lindsay disputes that point. ""If you target existing customers and get them to buy more, it doesn't grow the size of your market share,"" she said.
"
349,HOG,"If you already drink two Cokes a day, what are the chances you're going to drink three or four? Not high, Lindsay says.
"
350,HOG,"• Create widespread value. Aim your products to appeal to a large audience. Don't count on a few rabid fans to increase your market share, says Byron Sharp, director of the Ehrenberg-Bass Institute for Marketing Science at the University of South Australia.
"
351,HOG,"""Any brand can have a few fans,"" he wrote in ""How Brands Grow."" But that doesn't mean ""fans are of any financial or strategic consequence to marketers. These make for an entertaining story and that's all. Advertising agencies, who in general know very little about buyer behavior, love these stories.""
"
352,HOG,"Harley-Davidson (HOG), he says, is the poster child for brand loyalty. Sharp points out that the tag did little to protect the motorcycle firm from losing market share to Japanese brands often cited as having better quality.
"
353,HOG,"• Spend on advertising. Lindsay says firms should put resources toward advertising to increase market share. You want more new customers buying your product at full price. Price promotions don't get you a bigger piece of the pie.
"
354,HOG,"""It's long been known that when a product is often promoted at discount, we train the customer to buy it only when it's discounted, further eroding profit margins,"" Lindsay said. ""And just because they get a deal, people don't always go back and buy your product again; they might have just tried it because it was cheap.""
"
355,HOG,"• Analyze data correctly. People buy what they want and need on their own timeline. Your company shouldn't stock up while assuming that 20% of your customers give you 80% of your sales. Lindsay says data show that 50% of your business comes from 20% of your customers in the first year. The numbers become even less impressive as the years go on because people move on and try other products.
"
356,HOG,"• Find commonality. People are more alike than different. ""Brands sell to pretty much the same types of people and, in fact, the very same people,"" Lindsay said.
"
357,HOG,"The conventional wisdom is that competing brands sell to different market segments. So you must spend tons of resources trying to figure out which slice you're going to chase.You spend years in college learning and earning a business degree.

But that doesn't mean ""fans are of any financial or strategic consequence to marketers. These make for an entertaining story and that's all. Advertising agencies, who in general know very little about buyer behavior, love these stories.""Harley-Davidson (HOG), he says, is the poster child for brand loyalty. Sharp points out that the tag did little to protect the motorcycle firm from losing market share to Japanese brands often cited as having better quality.• Spend on advertising. Lindsay says firms should put resources toward advertising to increase market share. You want more new customers buying your product at full price. Price promotions don't get you a bigger piece of the pie.""It's long been known that when a product is often promoted at discount, we train the customer to buy it only when it's discounted, further eroding profit margins,"" Lindsay said. ""And just because they get a deal, people don't always go back and buy your product again; they might have just tried it because it was cheap.""• Analyze data correctly. People buy what they want and need on their own timeline. Your company shouldn't stock up while assuming that 20% of your customers give you 80% of your sales. Lindsay says data show that 50% of your business comes from 20% of your customers in the first year. The numbers become even less impressive as the years go on because people move on and try other products.• Find commonality. People are more alike than different. ""Brands sell to pretty much the same types of people and, in fact, the very same people,"" Lindsay said.The conventional wisdom is that competing brands sell to different market segments. So you must spend tons of resources trying to figure out which slice you're going to chase.

Lindsay says data show that 50% of your business comes from 20% of your customers in the first year. The numbers become even less impressive as the years go on because people move on and try other products.• Find commonality. People are more alike than different. ""Brands sell to pretty much the same types of people and, in fact, the very same people,"" Lindsay said.The conventional wisdom is that competing brands sell to different market segments. So you must spend tons of resources trying to figure out which slice you're going to chase.

501,HOG,"Fox Factory designs and makes high-performance suspension products for mountain bikes, snowmobiles, motorcycles and other on- and off-road vehicles. It aims for the high end of the market — bikes and vehicles ridden by racing pros and other serious competitors.
"
502,HOG,"""Most of Fox's customers on the bike side are real avid riders,"" said Lawrence Solow, an analyst at CJS Securities, which co-managed Fox Factory's Aug. 8 initial public offering on the Nasdaq.
"
503,HOG,"These are not your weekend warriors out to sweat off a few extra calories for a couple of hours.
"
504,HOG,"""About 5% of their customers are professionals, but the others also race or ride competitively,"" Solow said. ""These are customers who always aspire to have the best product.""
"
505,HOG,"Fox gets most of its business from original equipment manufacturers. Its key customers include Trek and Cannondale in the mountain bike market, and Ford (F) and Polaris (PII) in powered vehicles.
"
506,HOG,"Big In The Best Bikes
"
507,HOG,"About two-thirds of Fox's revenue come from its mountain bike division. In this segment, Fox offers front fork and rear suspension products. Solow estimates that the company has close to 70% market share in the ""high-end,"" or top quartile, of the 3.5 million suspended mountain bikes sold globally.
"
508,HOG,"""They are taking more share in high-end retail bikes,"" Solow said. ""They dominate that market in terms of suspension.""
"
509,HOG,"Fox also has a dominant position in certain powered vehicle categories. The company holds an estimated 75% of the suspension market for side-by-side vehicles, which are ATVs that hold two passengers instead of one.
"
510,HOG,"It also dominates the suspension market for a category known as on-road pickup trucks with off-road capabilities, Solow says. For that, Fox can thank its deal to supply suspension products for Ford's F-150 SVT Raptor, which was introduced in 2010.
"
511,HOG,"Fox's products are sold to around 150 OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) and distributed to more than 2,300 retail dealers. OEM customers account for about 81% of overall revenue.
"
512,HOG,"Most of Fox's competition comes from privately held companies. In mountain bikes, key rivals include Manitou Products, Marzocchi and RockShox. Its main competitors in powered vehicles include KYB, Sachs and Walker Evans Racing.
"
513,HOG,"One of Fox's competitive advantages is its ability to keep coming up with new designs, analysts say. The company was founded in 1974 by Robert Fox, an engineer and motocross rider who designed an ""AirShox"" system in his garage as a way of improving on the performance of traditional coil springs.
"
514,HOG,"In the years since, Fox Factory has earned a reputation for market-leading designs.
"
515,HOG,"""It has been first to market with numerous innovative new product offerings. In addition, Fox has been able to leverage its expertise to address a broader range of end-markets and a variety of vehicles,"" Jon Andersen, analyst at William Blair, noted in a Sept. 3 report initiating coverage on Fox Factory.
"
516,HOG,"He points to Fox Factory's success in the premium segment of the all-terrain vehicle category, which ""preceded the widespread adoption of Fox suspension technology in the recreational side-by-side market.""
"
517,HOG,"Innovating The Ride
"
518,HOG,"In 2012, Fox Factory launched more than 20 new products and got over 70% of its revenue from products introduced over the preceding three years.
"
519,HOG,"Those products include the Podium RC3 for motocross bikes. The RC3 allows riders to make external adjustments so the shock can be tuned for different skill levels, terrain and racing type.
"
520,HOG,"Another product, the ECS shock, boasts an external cooling system that can significantly lower temperatures, which lets powered vehicles operate at higher speeds for extended periods.
"
521,HOG,"New product introductions have helped Fox Factory more than double its annual revenue over the past four years. The company is on track to log nearly $270 million in sales this year, up from $236 million in 2012.
"
522,HOG,"Fox went public with an offering price of 15. It closed its first day of trading at 18.61, a 24% gain. Shares currently trade near 20.
"
523,HOG,"On Sept. 19, the company reported second-quarter results. It posted sales of $70.3 million, up 16% from the prior year. Net income climbed 32% to $5.7 million, while gross margin increased 190 basis points to 29.0%.
"
524,HOG,"In a statement, CEO Larry Enterline said Fox Factory ""identified several areas"" for future margin improvement, though he didn't name which areas.
"
525,HOG,"Over the past several years, the company has traded margin growth for more manufacturing capacity in order to meet sales demand, analyst Solow says. This increased production has led to ""rising inefficiencies,"" including excess staff, freight and other costs.
"
526,HOG,"While Fox Factory works to improve its efficiency and margins, it also has ""multiple pathways for growth,"" Andersen notes.
"
527,HOG,"He cites growth in existing product categories and market share, expansion into new product categories and geographic markets, and opportunities to move into other price categories.

"
531,HOG,"Tax And Spend: Puerto Rico's debt has been cut to junk by two credit rating agencies, prompting an outcry from officials of the recession-hit island that, after all, they've hiked taxes. Well, that's the problem right there.It's hard to not feel some sympathy for Puerto Rico's new governor, Alejandro Garcia Padilla, who upon entering office last year inherited a hog-wallow of $70 billion in debt, according to a long piece in the weekend's New York Times.The governor cut spending by 2%, balanced his budget a year ahead of schedule, reformed public pensions and reduced the territory's deficit by 70%.It wasn't good enough. Moody's cut the island's credit rating two notches to Ba2 late last week, following Standard & Poor's, which cut the municipal rating to BB+ a few days before that.""Unjust,"" the governor told the Times Sunday. ""I've done everything I can to avoid a downgrade,"" he said.However, to make those numbers add up, he hiked taxes on corporations to 39%, far higher than the U.S. rate and well above the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development average, and let stand a regressive tax on small businesses, giving them a top rate as high as 130%, hitting businesses with the smallest margins, such as groceries, the hardest.That, plus the phaseout in 2006 of an important tax incentive to U.S. corporations to locate operations tax-free on the island, caused the commonwealth's manufacturing job base to plunge from 160,000 to 75,000, a Detroit-like hollowing out in a very short period.Combined with public employee unions controlling the electricity supply, forcing companies in a manufacturing-heavy economy to pay double what companies on the U.S. mainland pay, and an increasingly failed educational system — which has kept the workforce uncompetitive (with 90% not meeting the No Child Left Behind standards nor proficient in English) — it's not hard to see why Puerto Rico has an economic growth deficit, which is the root of all its fiscal ills.This is what Moody's was trying to tell the Puerto Ricans when it cut their debt: ""While some economic indicators point to a preliminary stabilization, we do not see evidence of economic growth sufficient to reverse the commonwealth's negative financial trends.""Exactly. There's an old rule of thumb that a state can spend all it likes, but should never allow spending growth to exceed its economic growth. Austerity measures alone won't help in a prolonged recession, because the more critical problem to be tackled is government overspending and entrenched special interests, which are both far harder for politicians to deal with than simply taxing the productive to pay for the mistakes of the nonproductive.""The new administration has a bookkeeping mentality, as opposed to an economic development mentality,"" Pedro Pierluisi, the island's non-voting representative to Congress, told the Times.Too much bureaucracy, much of it for welfare, and too much rewarding failure over success drive up costs and drive out the productive. Puerto Rico's most talented citizens are voting with their feet. The island loses about 1% of its population a year, a deadly loss compounded over the years for any economy.To bring these people back, the governor has to fight to cut taxes and really go after the country's entrenched special interests with a baseball bat.The 39% corporate tax has to go.He also must fight in the U.S. Congress to reinstate Puerto Rico's special tax break that ended in 2006 so that investment will once again return.Finally, he must also take on Big Labor's favorite, the Jones Act, which artificially drives up shipping costs, putting local manufacturers at a disadvantage, demanding Congress at least give Puerto Rico an exception.Just balancing the budget on the backs of the productive class won't cut it. The ratings downgrades are a wake-up call to Puerto Rico to fight for real growth — not just a fiscal future a little less like Detroit.

547,HOG,"Polaris Industries (PII) delivers fun for adrenaline junkies. For investors, the maker of off-road vehicles, snowmobiles and motorcycles offers growth and income.The Medina, Minn.-based firm has posted top- and bottom-line growth in four of the past five years. Tough economic times in 2009 sent profit down 8% and sales down 20%. But Polaris' earnings and sales have grown by double digits each year since.Polaris' growth has come organically and through acquisitions. Recently, the company made two deals. In April, Polaris bought Aixam Mega — a French maker of small cars and light-duty commercial vehicles. The buyout expands its portfolio of small vehicles and positions it for international growth. Last year, 28% of total sales came from outside of the U.S.In December, Polaris bought Teton Outfitters, which makes Klim motorcycle and snowmobile riding gear.Polaris bought the iconic Indian Motorcycle in 2011 to compete against Harley-Davidson (HOG).In February, Polaris boosted its quarterly dividend by 14% to 42 cents a share. The firm has raised its shareholder dividend for 18 straight years.On an annual basis, the company pays $1.68 a share for a 1.6% yield. Polaris has the second-highest yield among the seven dividend-paying stocks in the Leisure-Products group.

"
593,HOG,"Ireland says her modeling career gave her (1) solid experience with top designers, (2) travel exposure to other cultures' needs, sparking inspiration for themes when she started designing her own products and (3) a tutorial in rejection. ""I was told all day I was too short, too fat, that my hair was wrong, that I wasn't smart enough,"" she recalled. ""It toughened me.""
"
594,HOG,"Her pet peeve was being told to ""shut up and pose."" It motivated her to get into a position where she could make the decisions.

"
678,HOG,"Automakers will post U.S. July sales throughout the day tomorrow. Another clue to the health of the industry comes Thursday when the world's No. 1 automaker, General Motors (GM), posted full second-quarter results.

679,HOG,"For GM earnings, analysts forecast 74 cents per share, down 52% from a year ago. Revenue is seen slipping 2% to $38.58 billion.
"
680,HOG,"GM, which retook the global top automaker spot from Toyota Motor (TM) in the first half, previously said it had record sales in China in the first six months of the year, up 11.3% from a year ago. But growth there has been slowing, causing headaches and concern for many large U.S. multinationals.

697,HOG,"It must be August in these United States. How else to explain all the ridiculous high dudgeon over the rodeo clown at the Missouri State Fair wearing an Obama mask?
"
698,HOG,"OMG, someone mocking the arrogant Oval Office guy, as late-night comedians do most weekdays now. (Leno: Obama out on his 'Middle Class Jobs & Opportunity Tour.' Don’t confuse that with his first term 'Jobs & Missed Opportunities Tour.')
"
699,HOG,"C’mon, America. This is the country that began with a Revolution, thumbing its nose at a monarch for George’s sake. It’s humorous here when someone makes fun of authority figures. Every president for decades has had his face turned into a grotesque Halloween mask. Or worse.
"
700,HOG,"Ever go to an NHL game when they introduce the commissioner? The boos are so loud you’d think he was Harry Reid. Or remember 2008 and the raunchy, disgusting abuse heaped on Sarah Palin and, to a lesser extent, Hillary Clinton?
"
701,HOG,"The job of rodeo clowns is to distract the angry bull after he’s dumped the rider. And the clowns entertain the human crowd in between bull riders’ getting dumped by the angry bull.
"
702,HOG,"One standard rodeo clown routine is to drag into the arena a scarecrow dummy that, holy smokes, suddenly comes alive because it’s actually a real person. Haha 
"
703,HOG,"Back in 1994, the the Examiner reminds us, one rodeo clown got a grand crowd response when a bull tore to shreds a scarecrow wearing a George H.W. Bush mask. The nation survived.
"
704,HOG,"Saturday night in Sedalia before a not-even-close-to-sellout crowd one of the clowns showed up on the arena floor wearing a face mask of Obama, who was going to unite us all, remember? An announcer asked if anyone wanted to see the bull run over the president? And, predictably, the crowd went wild, hooting and laughing.
"
705,HOG,"See, it’s funny because that clown wasn’t really Barack Obama. The real Barack Obama was vacationing on Martha’s Vineyard (see above), clowning around for the camera on a golf green, mocking drum majors or Americans not occupying a $7 million island estate. Who knows? Maybe he had a few of his homemade beers.
"
706,HOG,"The last time Obama was in a rodeo arena was 2007 when he wore good shoes and actually set up his teleprompter in the dirt and other debris. The real Barack Obama was never in any danger Saturday night and everyone watching the clown skit in Missouri knew that. Hence, they were free to laugh at the clowns.
"
707,HOG,"Now, admittedly, the brief rodeo skit wasn’t as entertaining as that episode of HBO’s “Game of Thrones” last year that featured the severed head of President George W. Bush on a stake.
"
708,HOG,"Apparently wearing a live mic, the Obama clown opined, “Hey, I know I’m a clown. He’s just running around acting like one. Doesn’t know he is one.”
"
709,HOG,"“Watch out for that bull, Obama!” said the arena announcer.
"
710,HOG,"But state fair officials were not laughing. And they don’t see it as free speech. No siree, Bubba. They were furious. They issued a written statement calling the act “inappropriate” and an “unconscionable stunt.”

762,HOG,"Any baseball player who makes the Hall of Fame does so because of talent and sweat.
"

"
765,HOG,"""I was always willing to listen, learn and apply something new,"" Winfield, 59, told IBD. ""Had I not been willing to make any adjustments, I would have been a different footnote in baseball history.""
"
766,HOG,"Early in his major league career, Winfield used a long, heavy bat, making it tough to catch up to pitchers' blazing fastballs. What to do? He noticed that the day's top hitters, namely Joe Morgan and Tony Perez, used lighter bats.
"
767,HOG,"""I experimented and finally settled on a 34-ounce, 35.5-inch bat, aware that as I got older and lost some strength or quickness I might have to go to any even shorter, lighter bat,"" he wrote in ""Winfield: A Player's Life.""
"
768,HOG,"It was one of many shifts that resulted in a 22-year career with six teams: the San Diego Padres, New York Yankees, California Angels, Toronto Blue Jays, Minnesota Twins and Cleveland Indians.
"
769,HOG,"Big Numbers
"
770,HOG,"When Winfield was done after the 1995 season, he stood as a rare player to produce at least 3,000 hits (3,110) and 400 homers (465).
"
771,HOG,"He qualified for 12 straight All-Star games, grabbed seven Golden Gloves for his outfield play and was a champion, helping Toronto to a triumph in the 1992 World Series.
"
772,HOG,"Growing up in Minneapolis, Winfield caught on to baseball with Bill Peterson. The local playground supervisor taught Dave and other kids how to play the sport and suited up some for an American Legion squad. ""Bill was an ex-Marine, although you're never really an ex-Marine,"" said Steve Winfield, Dave's older brother. ""He pushed the fundamentals of the game and emphasized repetition and more repetition. When I was 12 and Dave was 11, we were hotshots on the Pee Wee team. Bill took one look at us and said, 'Wait until I get you next year.'""
"
773,HOG,"Peterson tolerated no nonsense or excuses from his players, and always pushed them to work hard. Thanks in part to that direction, Winfield starred at the University of Minnesota in baseball and basketball — and made the dean's list.
"
774,HOG,"Winfield's athletic prowess was so impressive, four pro teams — baseball's Padres, the National Basketball Association's Atlanta Hawks, American Basketball Association's Utah Stars and National Football League's Minnesota Vikings — drafted him in 1973.
"
775,HOG,"He went with San Diego.
"
776,HOG,"""I chose the one where I felt I had the most fun and the most success, and that was baseball,"" he said. ""I liked a lot of the little things about it, like every time I was up at bat, I loved the challenge. I liked hitting the ball hard. I played good defense and I had a good (throwing) arm. It was all working for me, all of the tools and skills.""
"
777,HOG,"Not to mention his brain power.
"
778,HOG,"""It's very easy to forget he's one of the best athletes ever because when you talk to him that rarely comes up,"" said Mario Casciano, a long-time Winfield friend who also handles his public relations. ""When he was going to Yankee Stadium every day, he would carry at least one, usually two, attache cases. He was always reading.""
"
779,HOG,"When Winfield leapt from college to major league ball in the middle of the '73 season, he saw quickly how many players had it over him.
"
780,HOG,"He also caught on to what made them better: consistency, their ability to excel every day.
"
781,HOG,"Time for Winfield at adjust.
"
782,HOG,"""I knew that to develop that, to maximize my abilities, would mean I'd really have to work on the fundamentals — the right way to hit, field, run and think — and to incorporate them into a style that took into account my personal strengths, quirks and weaknesses as a player,"" Winfield wrote.
"
783,HOG,"On The Board
"
784,HOG,"He needed top traits to get his first major league hit. In the ninth inning of his first game, he bashed the ball to the left side, where Houston third baseman Doug Rader dived and knocked down the ball.
"
785,HOG,"Needing a hit ""like a hog needs slop,"" as Winfield wrote in his book, he charged to first base and slid head-first into the bag, beating Rader's throw.
"
786,HOG,"""It taught me that I have to work very hard and go all-out and see where that takes me,"" Winfield said. ""I never took anything for granted.""
"
787,HOG,"That surfaced the next year in spring training, with Winfield fighting for a roster spot and pinch-hitting in the ninth inning against Cleveland. He responded by smacking a double and — after a teammate's hit — running through the third base coach's stop sign.
"
788,HOG,"""I think, 'Hell, no! I've got a team to make,'"" Winfield wrote. ""The catcher is straddling the base path, the ball's on its way to his glove, but the way I see it I'm destined to score. I slam into the catcher, he drops the ball, the game's over, we win. And I'm a Padre.""
"
789,HOG,"Late in his career, at age 37, Winfield suffered a back injury that required surgery, costing him the entire 1989 season.
"
790,HOG,"Again, his adaptability kicked in.
"
791,HOG,"""After that year off, I made adjustments on where I placed my hands on the bat and how I moved by body to enable me to hit at a high level,"" he said.
"
792,HOG,"Winfield played well enough in 1990 to be voted Comeback Player of the Year. By 1992 he had landed in Toronto, where at age 40 he had a stellar year. His .290 batting average, 26 home runs and 108 runs batted in helped propel the Blue Jays to their first world title.
"
793,HOG,"Reflecting on his career, Winfield said, ""Baseball is a game, it's a science and it's a business. I think understanding all of those things helped me have a lengthy, successful career.

"
795,HOG,"SAN FRANCISCO — Ever since Apple's (AAPL) iPhone went on sale in 2007, Verizon Wireless customers have held out hope that, one day, AT&T's (T) grip as its exclusive U.S. distributor would be broken.
"
796,HOG,"That day arrives Feb. 10, when Verizon's iPhone goes on sale. Verizon started accepting preorders from existing customers on Thursday.
"
797,HOG,"It's the same Apple phone as AT&T sells, with a few small tweaks. The price is the same: $200 or $300, depending on how much memory you want. Verizon wants your signature on a two-year contract, just like AT&T.
"
798,HOG,"But even if it's the same phone, Verizon does things differently from AT&T, so there are some important factors to consider if you're thinking about getting one.
"
799,HOG,"Speedier Videos
"
800,HOG,"The big difference is likely to be network performance. AT&T's network is notoriously congested in some cities, including San Francisco, where for a week I tested both phones side by side. Out in the country, Verizon has wider coverage for broadband wireless data.
"
801,HOG,"The Verizon model was generally speedier at loading maps, websites and videos. For example, I was already done watching a YouTube clip of an adorable sneezing baby panda on Verizon's phone when AT&T's finally gave up on loading the video. At times, I couldn't make a call on the AT&T iPhone but could easily do so on Verizon's.
"
802,HOG,"So Verizon was faster for me, but the situation could be the opposite in many places across the country. Where AT&T's network isn't congested, it's actually faster than Verizon's, at least where AT&T has made recent upgrades.
"
803,HOG,"There are two other big changes.
"
804,HOG,"Verizon's iPhone is the first to work on so-called CDMA networks, the type used by Verizon, a joint venture of Verizon Communications (VZ) and the U.K.'s Vodafone (VOD). AT&T uses GSM, a technology that's more widely used around the world. This means the Verizon iPhone has very limited international roaming abilities. It won't work at all in Europe, for instance.
"
805,HOG,"Verizon's iPhone also includes Personal Hotspot, a Wi-Fi sharing feature that is becoming increasingly common on smart phones. It lets you connect as many as five gadgets to the Internet through the iPhone. If you're stuck without an Internet connection for your laptop, for instance, you connect through the phone and Verizon's network.
"
806,HOG,"The feature is easy to use, but there's a price for this convenience: $20 per month on top of what customers already pay for voice and data services. With voice, text and data plans, that could mean monthly bills topping $110.
"
807,HOG,"By contrast, AT&T lets you use the iPhone to surf on the Web on a single computer — and only by connecting the two with a USB cable or through Bluetooth. This, too, costs an extra $20 per month.
"
808,HOG,"Another thing to consider about Verizon's iPhone: If you're a data hog, or think you might want to be one, you might be drawn to Verizon's data plan, which allows for unlimited use.
"
809,HOG,"AT&T got rid of unlimited-data plans for new customers last year. Most users get by with the two gigabytes of data allotted through its $25-per-month plan, which is $5 cheaper than Verizon's unlimited plan. But if you go over the monthly allotment you'll shell out for more data — $10 automatically for every gigabyte or fraction of it over.
"
810,HOG,"Lock-In Data Plan
"
811,HOG,"If unlimited data is a must, sign up now, because Verizon has said it will switch to limited-data plans sometime this year.
"
812,HOG,"By getting an iPhone now, you can lock in the unlimited plan for at least two years. Another thing about Verizon's iPhone: You won't be able you use data services while making a phone call. That means that if you're chatting with your grandmother about her upcoming birthday, you can't put your grandma on speakerphone while ordering her a bouquet of tulips online. Nor can you look for new games in Apple's iTunes App Store while jumping into that conference call for work.
"
813,HOG,"It's annoying, though not a deal breaker, for me at least. And if you can connect to Wi-Fi, you will be able to use that to get online while talking on the phone.
"
814,HOG,"One more consideration: It's likely a new iPhone model will be out this summer, and it's not clear whether Verizon will get it right away. If weighing the pros and cons get to be too much, just remember that whether you buy it now or hold out for the next iteration, you're still getting an iPhone, silly.
"
815,HOG,"And when it comes to smart phones, that's a smart decision.SAN FRANCISCO — Ever since Apple's (AAPL) iPhone went on sale in 2007, Verizon Wireless customers have held out hope that, one day, AT&T's (T) grip as its exclusive U.S. distributor would be broken.That day arrives Feb. 10, when Verizon's iPhone goes on sale.

For example, I was already done watching a YouTube clip of an adorable sneezing baby panda on Verizon's phone when AT&T's finally gave up on loading the video. At times, I couldn't make a call on the AT&T iPhone but could easily do so on Verizon's.So Verizon was faster for me, but the situation could be the opposite in many places across the country. Where AT&T's network isn't congested, it's actually faster than Verizon's, at least where AT&T has made recent upgrades.There are two other big changes.Verizon's iPhone is the first to work on so-called CDMA networks, the type used by Verizon, a joint venture of Verizon Communications (VZ) and the U.K.'s Vodafone (VOD). AT&T uses GSM, a technology that's more widely used around the world. This means the Verizon iPhone has very limited international roaming abilities. It won't work at all in Europe, for instance.Verizon's iPhone also includes Personal Hotspot, a Wi-Fi sharing feature that is becoming increasingly common on smart phones. It lets you connect as many as five gadgets to the Internet through the iPhone. If you're stuck without an Internet connection for your laptop, for instance, you connect through the phone and Verizon's network.The feature is easy to use, but there's a price for this convenience: $20 per month on top of what customers already pay for voice and data services. With voice, text and data plans, that could mean monthly bills topping $110.By contrast, AT&T lets you use the iPhone to surf on the Web on a single computer — and only by connecting the two with a USB cable or through Bluetooth. This, too, costs an extra $20 per month.Another thing to consider about Verizon's iPhone: If you're a data hog, or think you might want to be one, you might be drawn to Verizon's data plan, which allows for unlimited use.AT&T got rid of unlimited-data plans for new customers last year. Most users get by with the two gigabytes of data allotted through its $25-per-month plan, which is $5 cheaper than Verizon's unlimited plan. But if you go over the monthly allotment you'll shell out for more data — $10 automatically for every gigabyte or fraction of it over.Lock-In Data PlanIf unlimited data is a must, sign up now, because Verizon has said it will switch to limited-data plans sometime this year.By getting an iPhone now, you can lock in the unlimited plan for at least two years. Another thing about Verizon's iPhone: You won't be able you use data services while making a phone call. That means that if you're chatting with your grandmother about her upcoming birthday, you can't put your grandma on speakerphone while ordering her a bouquet of tulips online. Nor can you look for new games in Apple's iTunes App Store while jumping into that conference call for work.It's annoying, though not a deal breaker, for me at least. And if you can connect to Wi-Fi, you will be able to use that to get online while talking on the phone.One more consideration: It's likely a new iPhone model will be out this summer, and it's not clear whether Verizon will get it right away. If weighing the pros and cons get to be too much, just remember that whether you buy it now or hold out for the next iteration, you're still getting an iPhone, silly.And when it comes to smart phones, that's a smart decision.

841,HOG,"Transcript of Joint News Conference by Prime Minister Netanyahu and President Obama
"
842,HOG,"PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU: Mr. President, Barack, it’s a great pleasure for me to host you here in Jerusalem. You’ve graciously hosted me many times in Washington, so I'm very pleased to have this opportunity to reciprocate. I hope that the goodwill and warmth of the people of Israel has already made you feel at home.
"
843,HOG,"PRESIDENT OBAMA: Very much so.
"
844,HOG,"PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU: We had an opportunity today to begin discussing the wide range of issues that are critical to both our countries. And foremost among these is Iran’s relentless pursuit of nuclear weapons. Mr. President, you have made it clear that you are determined to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons. I appreciate your forthright position on this point. I also appreciate that you have noted -- that you have acted to thwart the threat both through determined diplomacy and strong sanctions that are getting stronger yet. 
"
845,HOG,"Notwithstanding our joint efforts and your great success in mobilizing the international community, diplomacy and sanctions so far have not stopped Iran’s nuclear program. And as you know, my view is that in order to stop Iran’s nuclear programs peacefully, diplomacy and sanctions must be augmented by a clear and credible threat of military action. 
"
846,HOG,"In this regard, Mr. President, I want to thank you once again for always making clear that Israel must be able to defend itself, by itself, against any threat. I deeply appreciate those words because they speak to the great transformation that has occurred in the life of the Jewish people with the rebirth of the Jewish state. The Jewish people only two generations ago were once a powerless people, defenseless against those who sought our destruction. Today we have both the right and the capability to defend ourselves.
"
847,HOG,"And you said earlier today, the essence of the State of Israel, the essence of the rebirth of the Jewish state is we've fulfilled the age-old dream of the Jewish people to be masters of our fate in our own state. I think that was a wonderful line that I will cherish because it really gets down to the essence of what this state is about. That is why I know that you appreciate that Israel can never cede the right to defend ourselves to others, even to the greatest of our friends. And Israel has no better friend than the United States of America. So I look forward to continuing to work with you to address what is an existential threat to Israel and a grave threat to the peace and security of the world.
"
848,HOG,"Mr. President, we discussed today the situation in Syria. We share the goal of seeing a stable and peaceful Syria emerge from the carnage that we have witnessed over the last two years. That carnage has already resulted in the deaths of over 70,000 people and the suffering of millions. We also share a determination to prevent the deadly arsenal of weapons within Syria from falling into the hands of terrorist hands. And I have no doubt that the best way to do that is to work closely with the United States and other countries in the region to address this challenge. And that is what we intend to do. 
"
849,HOG,"Finally, Mr. President, your visit gave us an opportunity to try to find a way to advance peace between Israelis and Palestinians. My new government was sworn in two days ago. I know there have been questions regarding what the policy of the new government will be towards peace with the Palestinians. So let me be clear. Israel remains fully committed to peace and to the solution of two states for two peoples. We extend our hand in peace and in friendship to the Palestinian people.  
"
850,HOG,"I hope that your visit, along with the visit of Secretary of State Kerry, will help us turn a page in our relations with the Palestinians. Let us sit down at the negotiating table. Let us put aside all preconditions. Let us work together to achieve the historic compromise that will end our conflict once and for all. 
"
851,HOG,"Let me conclude, Mr. President, on a personal note. I know how valuable the time and the energy is of the American President, of yourself. This is the 10th time that we have met since you became President and since I became Prime Minister. You’ve chosen Israel as your first venue in your visit, your foreign visit in your second term. I want to thank you for the investment you have made in our relationship and in strengthening the friendship and alliance between our two countries. It is deeply, deeply appreciated.  
"
852,HOG,"You’ve come here on the eve of Passover. I've always considered it as our most cherished holiday. It celebrates the Jewish people's passage from slavery to freedom. Through the ages it has also inspired people struggling for freedom, including the Founding Fathers of the United States. So it’s a profound honor to host you, the leader of the free world, at this historic time in our ancient capital.  
"
853,HOG,"Mr. President, welcome to Israel. Welcome to Jerusalem. (Applause.) 
"
854,HOG,"PRESIDENT OBAMA: Thank you. Well, thank you, Prime Minister Netanyahu, for your kind words and for your wonderful welcome here today. And I want to express a special thanks to Sara as well as your two sons for their warmth and hospitality. It was wonderful to see them. They are -- I did inform the Prime Minister that they are very good-looking young men who clearly got their looks from their mother. (Laughter.)
"
855,HOG,"PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU: Well, I can say the same of your daughters. (Laughter.)
"
856,HOG,"PRESIDENT OBAMA: This is true. Our goal is to improve our gene pool by marrying women who are better than we are.
"
857,HOG,"Mr. Prime Minister, I want to begin by congratulating you on the formation of your new government.  In the United States, we work hard to find agreement between our two major parties. Here in Israel, you have to find consensus among many more. And few legislatures can compete with the intensity of the Knesset. But all of this reflects the thriving nature of Israel’s democracy. 
"
858,HOG,"As Bibi mentioned, this is our 10th meeting. We’ve spent more time together, working together, than I have with any leader. And this speaks to the closeness of our two nations, the interests and the values that we share, and the depth and breadth of the ties between our two peoples.
"
859,HOG,"As leaders, our most solemn responsibility is the security of our people -- that’s job number one. My job as President of the United States, first and foremost, is to keep the American people safe. Bibi, as Prime Minister, your first task is to keep the people of Israel safe. And Israel’s security needs are truly unique, as I’ve seen myself.  In past trips I visited villages near the Blue Line. I’ve walked through Israeli homes devastated by Hezbollah rockets. I’ve stood in Sderot, and met with children who simply want to grow up free from fear. And flying in today, I saw again how Israel’s security can be measured in mere miles and minutes. 
"
860,HOG,"As President, I’ve, therefore, made it clear America’s commitment to the security of the State of Israel is a solemn obligation, and the security of Israel is non-negotiable.  
"
861,HOG,"Today, our military and intelligence personnel cooperate more closely than ever before. We conduct more joint exercises and training than ever before. We’re providing more security assistance and advanced technology to Israel than ever before. And that includes more support for the missile defenses like Iron Dome, which I saw today and which has saved so many Israeli lives.
"
862,HOG,"In short -- and I don’t think this is just my opinion, I think, Bibi, you would share this -- America’s support for Israel’s security is unprecedented, and the alliance between our nations has never been stronger.  
"
863,HOG,"That’s the sturdy foundation we built on today as we addressed a range of shared challenges. As part of our long-term commitment to Israel’s security, the Prime Minister and I agreed to begin discussions on extending military assistance to Israel. Our current agreement lasts through 2017, and we’ve directed our teams to start working on extending it for the years beyond.     I’m also pleased to announce that we will take steps to ensure that there’s no interruption of funding for Iron Dome. As a result of decisions that I made last year, Israel will receive approximately $200 million this fiscal year and we will continue to work with Congress on future funding of Iron Dome.  These are further reminders that we will help to preserve Israel’s qualitative military edge so that Israel can defend itself, by itself, against any threat.
"
864,HOG,"We also discussed the way forward to a two-state solution between Israelis and Palestinians. And I very much welcomed Bibi’s words before I spoke. I’ll be meeting with President Abbas tomorrow, and I will have more to say on this topic in the speech that I deliver to the Israeli people tomorrow. But for now, let me just reiterate that a central element of a lasting peace must be a strong and secure Jewish state, where Israel’s security concerns are met, alongside a sovereign and independent Palestinian state.
"
865,HOG,"In this regard, I’d note that last year was a milestone -- the first year in four decades when not a single Israeli citizen lost their life because of terrorism emanating from the West Bank. It’s a reminder that Israel has a profound interest in a strong and effective Palestinian Authority. And as the Prime Minister’s new government begins its work, we’ll continue to look for steps that both Israelis and Palestinians can take to build trust and confidence upon which lasting peace will depend.
"
866,HOG,"We also reaffirmed the importance of ensuring Israel’s security given the changes and uncertainty in the region. As the United States supports the Egyptian people in their historic transition to democracy, we continue to underscore the necessity of Egypt contributing to regional security, preventing Hamas from rearming and upholding its peace treaty with Israel. 
"
867,HOG,"With respect to Syria, the United States continues to work with allies and friends and the Syrian opposition to hasten the end of Assad’s rule, to stop the violence against the Syrian people, and begin a transition toward a new government that respects the rights of all its people.  
"
868,HOG,"Assad has lost his legitimacy to lead by attacking the Syrian people with almost every conventional weapon in his arsenal, including Scud missiles. And we have been clear that the use of chemical weapons against the Syrian people would be a serious and tragic mistake. We also share Israel’s grave concern about the transfer of chemical or other weapon systems to terrorists -- such as Hezbollah -- that might be used against Israel. The Assad regime must understand that they will be held accountable for the use of chemical weapons or their transfer to terrorists.  
"
869,HOG,"And finally, we continued our close consultation on Iran. We agree that a nuclear-armed Iran would be a threat to the region, a threat to the world, and potentially an existential threat to Israel. And we agree on our goal. We do not have a policy of containment when it comes to a nuclear Iran. Our policy is to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon. 
"
870,HOG,"We prefer to resolve this diplomatically, and there’s still time to do so. Iran’s leaders must understand, however, that they have to meet their international obligations. And, meanwhile, the international community will continue to increase the pressure on the Iranian government. The United States will continue to consult closely with Israel on next steps. And I will repeat: All options are on the table.  We will do what is necessary to prevent Iran from getting the world’s worst weapons.
"
871,HOG,"Meeting none of these challenges will be easy. It will demand the same courage and resolve as those who have preceded us.  
"
872,HOG,"And on Friday, I’ll be honored to visit Mount Herzl and pay tribute to the leaders and soldiers who have laid down their lives for Israel. One of them was Yoni Netanyahu. And in one of his letters home, he wrote to his family, “Don’t forget -- strength, justice, and staunch resolution are on our side, and that is a great deal.”
"
873,HOG,"Mr. Prime Minister, like families across Israel, you and your family have served and sacrificed to defend your country and to pass it, safe and strong, to your children just as it was passed on to you.  Standing here today, I can say with confidence that Israel’s security is guaranteed because it has a great deal on its side, including the unwavering support of the United States of America.  (Applause.)
"
874,HOG,"Q   Mr. President, may I ask you about Syria, a practical question and a moral one?  Morally, how is it possible that for the last two years, tens of thousands of innocent civilians are being massacred and no one -- the world, the United States and you -- are doing anything to stop it immediately? On a practical level, you have said today and also in the past that the use of chemical weapons would be a crossing of a red line. It seems like this line was crossed yesterday. What specifically do you intend to do about it?
"
875,HOG,"PRESIDENT OBAMA:  I'll answer the question in reverse order, if you don't mind.  I'll talk about the chemical weapons first and then, the larger question.  
"
876,HOG,"With respect to chemical weapons, we intend to investigate thoroughly exactly what happened.  Obviously, in Syria right now you've got a war zone. You have information that's filtered out, but we have to make sure that we know exactly what happened -- what was the nature of the incident, what can we document, what can we prove. So I've instructed my teams to work closely with all of the countries in the region and international organizations and institutions to find out precisely whether or not this red line was crossed.  
"
877,HOG,"I will note, without at this point having all the facts before me, that we know the Syrian government has the capacity to carry out chemical weapon attacks. We know that there are those in the Syrian government who have expressed a willingness to use chemical weapons if necessary to protect themselves. I am deeply skeptical of any claim that, in fact, it was the opposition that used chemical weapons. Everybody who knows the facts of the chemical weapon stockpiles inside Syria as well as the Syrian government's capabilities I think would question those claims. But I know that they're floating out there right now. 
"
878,HOG,"The broader point is, is that once we establish the facts I have made clear that the use of chemical weapons is a game changer. And I won't make an announcement today about next steps because I think we have to gather the facts. But I do think that when you start seeing weapons that can cause potential devastation and mass casualties and you let that genie out of the bottle, then you are looking potentially at even more horrific scenes than we've already seen in Syria. And the international community has to act on that additional information.  
"
879,HOG,"But as is always the case when it comes to issues of war and peace, I think having the facts before you act is very important.  More broadly, as I said in my opening statement, I believe that the Assad regime has lost all credibility and legitimacy. I think Assad must go -- and I believe he will go. It is incorrect for you to say that we have done nothing. We have helped to mobilize the isolation of the Assad regime internationally.  We have supported and recognized the opposition. We have provided hundreds of millions of dollars in support for humanitarian aid. We have worked diligently with other countries in the region to provide additional tools to move towards a political transition within Syria.
"
880,HOG,"If your suggestion is, is that I have not acted unilaterally militarily inside of....
"
881,HOG,"....Syria, well, the response has been -- or my response would be that, to the extent possible, I want to make sure that we're working as an international community to deal with this problem, because I think it’s a world problem, not simply a United States problem, or an Israel problem, or a Turkish problem. It’s a world problem when tens of thousands of people are being slaughtered, including innocent women and children.  
"
882,HOG,"And so we will continue to work in an international framework to try to bring about the kind of change that's necessary in Syria. Secretary Kerry has been working nonstop since he came into his current position to try to help mobilize and organize our overall efforts, and we will continue to push every lever that we have to try to bring about a resolution inside of Syria that respects the rights and the safety and security of all people, regardless of whatever sectarian lines currently divide Syria.
"
883,HOG,"Last point I'll make, which is probably obvious, is this is not easy. When you start seeing a civil war that has sectarian elements to it, and you’ve got a repressive government that is intent on maintaining power, and you have mistrust that has broken out along sectarian lines, and you have an opposition that has not had the opportunity or time to organize itself both politically as well as militarily, then you end up seeing some of the devastation that you’ve been seeing. And we're going to do everything we can to continue to prevent it.  And I know that the vast majority of our international partners feel the same way.
"
884,HOG,"Q   Yes, thank you. There was some friendly banter between you two gentlemen on the tarmac today about red lines, and I'm wondering how much of a serious matter that actually became in your talks and will be in your talks to come tonight. President Obama has said it will take Iran at least a year to build a bomb. That's months longer than the Prime Minister believes.
"
885,HOG,"Mr. President, are you asking the Prime Minister to be more patient, to hold off for at least a year on any kind of military action against Iran?
"
886,HOG,"Mr. Prime Minister, has President Obama’s words -- have they convinced you that he is putting forth the credible military threat that you have repeatedly asked for, or there’s a need to go further? Thank you.
"
887,HOG,"PRESIDENT OBAMA:  Bibi, why don't you go -- take a first swing at this.
"
888,HOG,"PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU: Well, first of all, there are so many strips of different colors on the tarmac that we -- (laughter) -- we did have a joke about that.  But obviously this matter is no joke. It relates to our very existence and to something also that the President correctly identified as a grave strategic threat to the United States and to the peace and security of the world.
"
889,HOG,"I'm absolutely convinced that the President is determined to prevent Iran from getting nuclear weapons.  And I appreciate that. And I also appreciate something that he said, which I mentioned in my opening remarks, that the Jewish people have come back to their own country to be the masters of their own fate. And I appreciate the fact that the President has reaffirmed -- more than any other President -- Israel’s right and duty to defend itself, by itself, against any threat.  We just heard those important words now, and I think that sums up our -- I would say -- our common view.
"
890,HOG,"Iran is a grave threat to Israel, a grave threat to the world -- a nuclear Iran. The United States is committed to deal with it. Israel is committed to deal with it. We have different vulnerabilities, obviously, and different capabilities. We take that into account. But what we do maintain -- and the President I think is the first to do so -- is that Israel has a right to independently defend itself against any threat, including the Iranian threat.
"
891,HOG,"PRESIDENT OBAMA:  I think the only thing I would add is that our intelligence cooperation on this issue, the consultation between our militaries, our intelligence, is unprecedented, and there is not a lot of light, a lot of daylight between our countries’ assessments in terms of where Iran is right now.
"
892,HOG,"I think that what Bibi alluded to, which is absolutely correct, is each country has to make its own decisions when it comes to the awesome decision to engage in any kind of military action, and Israel is differently situated than the United States. And I would not expect that the Prime Minister would make a decision about his country’s security and defer that to any other country -- any more than the United States would defer our decisions about what was important for our national security.
"
893,HOG,"I have shared with Bibi, as I've said to the entire world, as I've said to the Iranian people and Iranian leaders, that I think there is time to resolve this issue diplomatically. The question is, will Iranian leadership seize that opportunity? Will they walk through that door?  
"
894,HOG,"And it would be in everybody’s interests -- not just Israel’s interests, not just the United States’ interests -- it would be in the interest of the Iranian people if this gets resolved diplomatically. Because the truth of the matter is, is that the most permanent solution to the Iranian situation is ultimately going to be their decision that it is not worth it for them to pursue nuclear weapons. That will be the lasting change. If we can get that, that's good for everybody, including Iran, because it would allow them to break out of the isolation that has hampered their society and their economic development for many years. 
"
895,HOG,"But I don't know whether they're going to be willing to take that step. And obviously, their past behavior indicates that, in the words of -- or a play on words on what Ronald Reagan said -- we can't even trust yet, much less verify. But we do have to test the proposition that this can be resolved diplomatically. And if it can't, then I’ve repeated to Bibi what I've said publicly, and that is, is that we will leave all options on the table in resolving it.
"
896,HOG,"Q    Mr. Prime Minister, do you agree or disagree with the President’s one-year assessment?
"
897,HOG,"PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU:  We have another question. 
"
898,HOG,"Q   Welcome, Mr. President. On your way back to Washington on Friday, what will you consider a successful visit? Convincing the Israeli leaders that they can rely on you on the Iranian issue, especially that they learned that there are differences between Israel and the United States concerning the enrichment of the Iranian -- or convincing both sides -- Israelis and the Palestinians -- to revive the floundering negotiation, reviving the peace process, the floundering peace process? 
"
899,HOG,"PRESIDENT OBAMA:  Well, my main goal on this trip has been to have an opportunity to speak directly to the Israeli people at a time when obviously what was already a pretty tough neighborhood has gotten tougher, and let them know that they've got a friend in the United States, that we have your back; that we consider Israel's security of extraordinary importance to us, not just because of the bonds between our peoples but also because of our own national security interest. 
"
900,HOG,"In that context, what I have also sought to achieve here is further consultations, building on what we've already discussed -- as Bibi has just formed a new government, as I am entering my second term -- that we continue to have close consultation around some of these shared interests that we've already discussed, Iran being obviously a prominent shared concern. I want to make sure that the Israeli people and the Israeli government consistently understand my thinking and how I'm approaching this problem. And I want to understand how the Israeli government and the Prime Minister is approaching this problem to make sure that there are no misunderstandings there.  With respect to the peace process, as I said, I'll have more to say about this tomorrow. But I think you are absolutely right that over the last year, year and a half, two years, two and a half years, we haven't gone forward. We haven't seen the kind of progress that we would like to see.  
"
901,HOG,"There's some elements of good news. I mean, the fact of the matter is, is that even with all that's been happening in the region, the Palestinian Authority has worked effectively in cooperation with the international community -- in part because of some of the training that we, the United States, provided -- to do its part in maintaining security in the West Bank. We have seen some progress when it comes to economic development and opportunity for the Palestinian people.  
"
902,HOG,"But the truth of the matter is trying to bring this to some sort of clear settlement, a solution that would allow Israelis to feel as if they've broken out of the current isolation that they're in, in this region, that would allow the incredible economic growth that's taking place inside this country to be a model for trade and commerce and development throughout the region at a time when all these other countries need technology and commerce and jobs for their young people, for Palestinians to feel a sense that they, too, are masters of their own fate, for Israel to feel that the possibilities of rockets raining down on their families has diminished -- that kind of solution we have not yet seen. 
"
903,HOG,"And so what I want to do is listen, hear from Prime Minister Netanyahu -- tomorrow, I'll have a chance to hear from Abu Mazen -- to get a sense from them, how do they see this process moving forward. What are the possibilities and what are the constraints, and how can the United States be helpful? And I purposely did not want to come here and make some big announcement that might not match up with what the realities and possibilities on the ground are.  I wanted to spend some time listening before I talked -- which my mother always taught me was a good idea.  
"
904,HOG,"And so, hopefully -- I'll consider it a success if when I go back on Friday, I'm able to say to myself I have a better understanding of what the constraints are, what the interests of the various parties are, and how the United States can play a constructive role in bringing about a lasting peace and two states living side by side in peace and security. 
"
905,HOG,"Q    Thank you, Mr. President; Mr. Prime Minister. Mr. President, I'm going to follow up a little bit on the peace process. You began your term, your first term, big fanfare -- Cairo speech to talk to the Muslim world, the decision to have a Middle East envoy early. You said you weren't going to let this slip to your second term.  We're in your second term with the Middle East peace process.  What went wrong?  Why are we further away from a two-state solution? I know you said you want to talk more about this tomorrow, but I am curious. What do you believe went wrong? Did you push Israel too hard? What do you wish you would have done differently?
"
906,HOG,"And, Mr. Prime Minister, I want to help out my colleague over here on the follow-up that he had, which had to do with do you accept the President's understanding that Iran is a year away when it comes to nuclear weapons? And another question I had for you --
"
907,HOG,"PRESIDENT OBAMA:  Chuck, how many have you got? Do you guys do this in the Israeli press -- you say you get one question and then you add like five? 
"
908,HOG,"Q    Well, I'm helping him. I'm helping him with his -- 
"
909,HOG,"PRESIDENT OBAMA: You see how the young lady from Channel One, she had one question. She was very well-behaved, Chuck. 
"
910,HOG,"Q    I had that one for you and -- (laughter) -- 
"
911,HOG,"PRIME NETANYAHU:  These are commuted questions they have. (Laughter.)  
"
912,HOG,"Q    Apparently -- I thought I had four questions.  
"
913,HOG,"PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU: Reiterations.  
"
914,HOG,"Q    Passover starts in a couple of days. (Laughter.) I get four questions, right?  
"
915,HOG,"PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU:  Look, this is not a Kosher question, but don't hog it. (Laughter.) 
"
916,HOG,"Q  I guess my question to you was going to be, why do you believe the Israeli people have not embraced President Obama the same way they embraced our last two U.S. Presidents?  Thank you. 
"
917,HOG,"PRESIDENT OBAMA: So you had to get a polling question in there right at the end? (Laughter.)  Chuck, I mean, you're just incorrigible. (Laughter.)  
"
918,HOG,"Well, look, the opening premise of your question was that having failed to achieve peace in the Middle East in my first term that I must have screwed up somehow. And I will tell you I hope I'm a better President now than when I first came into office, but my commitment was not to achieve a peace deal in my first year, or in my second year or my third year. That would have been nice. What I said was I was not going to wait to start on the issue until my second term, because I thought it was too important.  And that's exactly what I did.  
"
919,HOG,"I'm absolutely sure that there are a host of things that I could have done that would have been more deft and would have created better optics. But ultimately, this is a really hard problem. It’s been lingering for over six decades. And the parties involved have some profound interests that you can’t spin, you can’t smooth over. And it is a hard slog to work through all of these issues.  
"
920,HOG,"I will add that both parties also have politics, just like we do back home. There are a whole bunch of things that I’d like to do back in the United States that I didn’t get done in my first term. And I’m sure I could have been more deft there as well. But some of it’s just because it’s hard, and people disagree, and it takes I think a confluence of both good diplomatic work, but also timing, serendipity, things falling into place at the right time, the right players feeling that this is the moment to seize it.  
"
921,HOG,"And my goal here is just to make sure that the United State is a positive force in trying to create those opportunities as frequently as possible, and to be as clear as possible as to why we think that this is an important priority -- not only because of some Pollyanna-ish views about can’t we all get along and hold hands and sing “Kumbaya,” but because I actually believe that Israel’s security will be enhanced with a resolution to this issue. I believe that Palestinians will prosper and can channel their extraordinary energies and entrepreneurship in more positive ways with a resolution to this issue.  The entire region I think will be healthier with a resolution to this issue.  
"
922,HOG,"So I’m going to keep on making that argument. And I will admit that, frankly, sometimes it would be easier not to make the argument and to avoid the question, precisely because it’s hard. That’s not the approach that I’ve tried to take.  
"
923,HOG,"And there have probably been times where, when I’ve made statements about what I think needs to happen, the way it gets filtered through our press -- it may be interpreted in ways that get Israelis nervous, just like there are folks back home who sometimes get nervous about areas where they aren't sure exactly where I stand on things. That's why I always like the opportunity to talk directly to you guys.  Hopefully, you'll show the live film, as opposed to the edited version.  
"
924,HOG,"With that, I think you've got four questions to answer, Bibi. (Laughter.) 
"
925,HOG,"PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU:  I think that there's a misunderstanding about time. If Iran decides to go for a nuclear weapon -- that is, to actually manufacture the weapon -- then it probably -- then it would take them about a year. I think that's correct. They could defer that a long time but still get through the enrichment process -- that is, to make a weapon you need two things; you need enriched uranium of a critical amount and then you need a weapon. You can't have the weapon without the enriched uranium, but you can have the enriched uranium without the weapon.  
"
926,HOG,"Iran right now is enriching uranium. It’s pursuing it. It hasn’t yet reached the red line that I had described in my speech at the U.N. -- they're getting closer, though. 
"
927,HOG,"And the question of manufacturing the weapon is a different thing. The President said correctly that we have -- on these issues that are a little arcane, they sound a little detailed to you -- but on these matters we share information and we have a common assessment. We have a common assessment. 
"
928,HOG,"In any case, Iran gets to an immunity zone when they get through the enrichment process, in our view -- in our view -- and whatever time is left, there's not a lot of time. And every day that passes diminishes it. But we do have a common assessment. On the schedules, on intelligence, we share that intelligence and we don't have any argument about it. I think it's important to state that clearly. 
"
929,HOG,"I think that people should get to know President Obama the way I've gotten to know. And I think you've just heard something that is very meaningful. It may have escaped you, but it hasn't escaped me. And that is the President announced that in addition to all the aid that his administration has provided -- including Iron Dome, including defense funding for Israel during very difficult times -- he has announced that we are going to begin talks on another 10-year process arrangement to ensure American military assistance to Israel. I think this is very significant.       And I want to express my thanks for everything that you have done. And I want to thank you also for that statement you just made. I think it's very, very important.  
"
930,HOG,"So I think Israelis will judge this by the unfolding events and by what is happening, what is actually taking place. And for thi -- you know, there's a very simple answer to your question -- the gentleman from NBC, right? Yes.  Well, for this, you need, you see, a second term as President and a third term as Prime Minister. That really fixes things. (Laughter.) 
"
931,HOG,"PRESIDENT OBAMA: All right, thank you very much, everybody. (Applause.)     ####

933,HOG,"Wasn't it great to see what a super-buddy Barack Obama has suddenly become with Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu? Just super.Very reassuring after all the suspicions, leaks, lectures of the 51-year-old Christian by the 63-year-old Jew, open mic derision and outright snubs. Doesn't every president leave an allied visiting prime minister waiting downstairs like an unwanted life insurance salesman while the president dines elsewhere?So, we are to imagine that four-plus years of animosity, impatience, mis-steps and mistrust have evaporated as quickly as an Obama promise. The Democrat even patted Netanyahu's back a few times, which is politico for ""I'm being really sincere here for the cameras."" The American visitor also took over wrapping up their joint news conference like the host he wasn't. (Scroll down for the full text and a video.)At that news conference on the first of Obama's three-day Mideast trip, they were Barack-this and Bibi-that. Out came the most exhausted public cliché about both men marrying up in life. When Obama called Sara Netanyahu over to join the two men for photos, he used the ""rose between two thorns"" line that was old before Joe Biden was born. Clichés are the forced phrases politicians fall back on when they don't have anything real to say.There were too the kabuki-cadenced diplomatic niceties about appreciating each other's positions and eternal friendship and lasting alliance and closest-ever security/intelligence relationship, yada-yada. Obama's most important words were: ""We do not have a policy of containment when it comes to a nuclear Iran. Our policy is to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon....I will repeat: All options are on the table. We will do what is necessary to prevent Iran from getting the world’s worst weapons.""Sounds like a pretty ironclad vow, until one day it isn't. Like closing Guantanamo, which remains open.Read the words below for yourself or scroll down for a C-SPAN video of the complete news conference and get a feel for their expressions and body language.RELATED:On eve of Obama's Israel visit, he makes nice to Iran againWith a new Pope in place, cardinals turn to replacing Joy BeharObama's 4-hour roundtrip, 747 flight to Chicago to urge fuel conservation Transcript of Joint News Conference by Prime Minister Netanyahu and President ObamaPRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU: Mr. President, Barack, it’s a great pleasure for me to host you here in Jerusalem. You’ve graciously hosted me many times in Washington, so I'm very pleased to have this opportunity to reciprocate. I hope that the goodwill and warmth of the people of Israel has already made you feel at home.PRESIDENT OBAMA: Very much so.PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU: We had an opportunity today to begin discussing the wide range of issues that are critical to both our countries. And foremost among these is Iran’s relentless pursuit of nuclear weapons. Mr. President, you have made it clear that you are determined to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons. I appreciate your forthright position on this point. I also appreciate that you have noted -- that you have acted to thwart the threat both through determined diplomacy and strong sanctions that are getting stronger yet. Notwithstanding our joint efforts and your great success in mobilizing the international community, diplomacy and sanctions so far have not stopped Iran’s nuclear program. And as you know, my view is that in order to stop Iran’s nuclear programs peacefully, diplomacy and sanctions must be augmented by a clear and credible threat of military action. In this regard, Mr. President, I want to thank you once again for always making clear that Israel must be able to defend itself, by itself, against any threat. I deeply appreciate those words because they speak to the great transformation that has occurred in the life of the Jewish people with the rebirth of the Jewish state. The Jewish people only two generations ago were once a powerless people, defenseless against those who sought our destruction. Today we have both the right and the capability to defend ourselves.And you said earlier today, the essence of the State of Israel, the essence of the rebirth of the Jewish state is we've fulfilled the age-old dream of the Jewish people to be masters of our fate in our own state. I think that was a wonderful line that I will cherish because it really gets down to the essence of what this state is about. That is why I know that you appreciate that Israel can never cede the right to defend ourselves to others, even to the greatest of our friends. And Israel has no better friend than the United States of America. So I look forward to continuing to work with you to address what is an existential threat to Israel and a grave threat to the peace and security of the world.Mr. President, we discussed today the situation in Syria. We share the goal of seeing a stable and peaceful Syria emerge from the carnage that we have witnessed over the last two years. That carnage has already resulted in the deaths of over 70,000 people and the suffering of millions. We also share a determination to prevent the deadly arsenal of weapons within Syria from falling into the hands of terrorist hands. And I have no doubt that the best way to do that is to work closely with the United States and other countries in the region to address this challenge. And that is what we intend to do. Finally, Mr. President, your visit gave us an opportunity to try to find a way to advance peace between Israelis and Palestinians. My new government was sworn in two days ago. I know there have been questions regarding what the policy of the new government will be towards peace with the Palestinians. So let me be clear. Israel remains fully committed to peace and to the solution of two states for two peoples. We extend our hand in peace and in friendship to the Palestinian people.  I hope that your visit, along with the visit of Secretary of State Kerry, will help us turn a page in our relations with the Palestinians. Let us sit down at the negotiating table. Let us put aside all preconditions. Let us work together to achieve the historic compromise that will end our conflict once and for all. Let me conclude, Mr. President, on a personal note. I know how valuable the time and the energy is of the American President, of yourself. This is the 10th time that we have met since you became President and since I became Prime Minister. You’ve chosen Israel as your first venue in your visit, your foreign visit in your second term. I want to thank you for the investment you have made in our relationship and in strengthening the friendship and alliance between our two countries. It is deeply, deeply appreciated.  You’ve come here on the eve of Passover. I've always considered it as our most cherished holiday. It celebrates the Jewish people's passage from slavery to freedom. Through the ages it has also inspired people struggling for freedom, including the Founding Fathers of the United States. So it’s a profound honor to host you, the leader of the free world, at this historic time in our ancient capital.  Mr. President, welcome to Israel. Welcome to Jerusalem. (Applause.) PRESIDENT OBAMA: Thank you. Well, thank you, Prime Minister Netanyahu, for your kind words and for your wonderful welcome here today. And I want to express a special thanks to Sara as well as your two sons for their warmth and hospitality. It was wonderful to see them. They are -- I did inform the Prime Minister that they are very good-looking young men who clearly got their looks from their mother. (Laughter.)PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU: Well, I can say the same of your daughters. (Laughter.)PRESIDENT OBAMA: This is true. Our goal is to improve our gene pool by marrying women who are better than we are.Mr. Prime Minister, I want to begin by congratulating you on the formation of your new government.  In the United States, we work hard to find agreement between our two major parties. Here in Israel, you have to find consensus among many more. And few legislatures can compete with the intensity of the Knesset. But all of this reflects the thriving nature of Israel’s democracy. As Bibi mentioned, this is our 10th meeting. We’ve spent more time together, working together, than I have with any leader. And this speaks to the closeness of our two nations, the interests and the values that we share, and the depth and breadth of the ties between our two peoples.As leaders, our most solemn responsibility is the security of our people -- that’s job number one. My job as President of the United States, first and foremost, is to keep the American people safe. Bibi, as Prime Minister, your first task is to keep the people of Israel safe. And Israel’s security needs are truly unique, as I’ve seen myself.  In past trips I visited villages near the Blue Line. I’ve walked through Israeli homes devastated by Hezbollah rockets. I’ve stood in Sderot, and met with children who simply want to grow up free from fear. And flying in today, I saw again how Israel’s security can be measured in mere miles and minutes. As President, I’ve, therefore, made it clear America’s commitment to the security of the State of Israel is a solemn obligation, and the security of Israel is non-negotiable.  Today, our military and intelligence personnel cooperate more closely than ever before. We conduct more joint exercises and training than ever before. We’re providing more security assistance and advanced technology to Israel than ever before. And that includes more support for the missile defenses like Iron Dome, which I saw today and which has saved so many Israeli lives.In short -- and I don’t think this is just my opinion, I think, Bibi, you would share this -- America’s support for Israel’s security is unprecedented, and the alliance between our nations has never been stronger.  That’s the sturdy foundation we built on today as we addressed a range of shared challenges. As part of our long-term commitment to Israel’s security, the Prime Minister and I agreed to begin discussions on extending military assistance to Israel. Our current agreement lasts through 2017, and we’ve directed our teams to start working on extending it for the years beyond.     I’m also pleased to announce that we will take steps to ensure that there’s no interruption of funding for Iron Dome. As a result of decisions that I made last year, Israel will receive approximately $200 million this fiscal year and we will continue to work with Congress on future funding of Iron Dome.  These are further reminders that we will help to preserve Israel’s qualitative military edge so that Israel can defend itself, by itself, against any threat.We also discussed the way forward to a two-state solution between Israelis and Palestinians. And I very much welcomed Bibi’s words before I spoke. I’ll be meeting with President Abbas tomorrow, and I will have more to say on this topic in the speech that I deliver to the Israeli people tomorrow. But for now, let me just reiterate that a central element of a lasting peace must be a strong and secure Jewish state, where Israel’s security concerns are met, alongside a sovereign and independent Palestinian state.In this regard, I’d note that last year was a milestone -- the first year in four decades when not a single Israeli citizen lost their life because of terrorism emanating from the West Bank. It’s a reminder that Israel has a profound interest in a strong and effective Palestinian Authority. And as the Prime Minister’s new government begins its work, we’ll continue to look for steps that both Israelis and Palestinians can take to build trust and confidence upon which lasting peace will depend.We also reaffirmed the importance of ensuring Israel’s security given the changes and uncertainty in the region. As the United States supports the Egyptian people in their historic transition to democracy, we continue to underscore the necessity of Egypt contributing to regional security, preventing Hamas from rearming and upholding its peace treaty with Israel. With respect to Syria, the United States continues to work with allies and friends and the Syrian opposition to hasten the end of Assad’s rule, to stop the violence against the Syrian people, and begin a transition toward a new government that respects the rights of all its people.  Assad has lost his legitimacy to lead by attacking the Syrian people with almost every conventional weapon in his arsenal, including Scud missiles. And we have been clear that the use of chemical weapons against the Syrian people would be a serious and tragic mistake. We also share Israel’s grave concern about the transfer of chemical or other weapon systems to terrorists -- such as Hezbollah -- that might be used against Israel. The Assad regime must understand that they will be held accountable for the use of chemical weapons or their transfer to terrorists.  And finally, we continued our close consultation on Iran. We agree that a nuclear-armed Iran would be a threat to the region, a threat to the world, and potentially an existential threat to Israel. And we agree on our goal. We do not have a policy of containment when it comes to a nuclear Iran. Our policy is to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon. We prefer to resolve this diplomatically, and there’s still time to do so. Iran’s leaders must understand, however, that they have to meet their international obligations. And, meanwhile, the international community will continue to increase the pressure on the Iranian government. The United States will continue to consult closely with Israel on next steps. And I will repeat: All options are on the table.  We will do what is necessary to prevent Iran from getting the world’s worst weapons.Meeting none of these challenges will be easy. It will demand the same courage and resolve as those who have preceded us.  And on Friday, I’ll be honored to visit Mount Herzl and pay tribute to the leaders and soldiers who have laid down their lives for Israel. One of them was Yoni Netanyahu. And in one of his letters home, he wrote to his family, “Don’t forget -- strength, justice, and staunch resolution are on our side, and that is a great deal.”Mr. Prime Minister, like families across Israel, you and your family have served and sacrificed to defend your country and to pass it, safe and strong, to your children just as it was passed on to you.  Standing here today, I can say with confidence that Israel’s security is guaranteed because it has a great deal on its side, including the unwavering support of the United States of America.  (Applause.)Q   Mr. President, may I ask you about Syria, a practical question and a moral one?  Morally, how is it possible that for the last two years, tens of thousands of innocent civilians are being massacred and no one -- the world, the United States and you -- are doing anything to stop it immediately? On a practical level, you have said today and also in the past that the use of chemical weapons would be a crossing of a red line. It seems like this line was crossed yesterday. What specifically do you intend to do about it?PRESIDENT OBAMA:  I'll answer the question in reverse order, if you don't mind.  I'll talk about the chemical weapons first and then, the larger question.  With respect to chemical weapons, we intend to investigate thoroughly exactly what happened.  Obviously, in Syria right now you've got a war zone. You have information that's filtered out, but we have to make sure that we know exactly what happened -- what was the nature of the incident, what can we document, what can we prove. So I've instructed my teams to work closely with all of the countries in the region and international organizations and institutions to find out precisely whether or not this red line was crossed.  I will note, without at this point having all the facts before me, that we know the Syrian government has the capacity to carry out chemical weapon attacks. We know that there are those in the Syrian government who have expressed a willingness to use chemical weapons if necessary to protect themselves. I am deeply skeptical of any claim that, in fact, it was the opposition that used chemical weapons. Everybody who knows the facts of the chemical weapon stockpiles inside Syria as well as the Syrian government's capabilities I think would question those claims. But I know that they're floating out there right now. The broader point is, is that once we establish the facts I have made clear that the use of chemical weapons is a game changer. And I won't make an announcement today about next steps because I think we have to gather the facts. But I do think that when you start seeing weapons that can cause potential devastation and mass casualties and you let that genie out of the bottle, then you are looking potentially at even more horrific scenes than we've already seen in Syria. And the international community has to act on that additional information.  But as is always the case when it comes to issues of war and peace, I think having the facts before you act is very important.  More broadly, as I said in my opening statement, I believe that the Assad regime has lost all credibility and legitimacy. I think Assad must go -- and I believe he will go. It is incorrect for you to say that we have done nothing. We have helped to mobilize the isolation of the Assad regime internationally.  We have supported and recognized the opposition. We have provided hundreds of millions of dollars in support for humanitarian aid. We have worked diligently with other countries in the region to provide additional tools to move towards a political transition within Syria.If your suggestion is, is that I have not acted unilaterally militarily inside of....
"
934,HOG,"....Syria, well, the response has been -- or my response would be that, to the extent possible, I want to make sure that we're working as an international community to deal with this problem, because I think it’s a world problem, not simply a United States problem, or an Israel problem, or a Turkish problem. It’s a world problem when tens of thousands of people are being slaughtered, including innocent women and children.  
"
935,HOG,"And so we will continue to work in an international framework to try to bring about the kind of change that's necessary in Syria. Secretary Kerry has been working nonstop since he came into his current position to try to help mobilize and organize our overall efforts, and we will continue to push every lever that we have to try to bring about a resolution inside of Syria that respects the rights and the safety and security of all people, regardless of whatever sectarian lines currently divide Syria.
"
936,HOG,"Last point I'll make, which is probably obvious, is this is not easy. When you start seeing a civil war that has sectarian elements to it, and you’ve got a repressive government that is intent on maintaining power, and you have mistrust that has broken out along sectarian lines, and you have an opposition that has not had the opportunity or time to organize itself both politically as well as militarily, then you end up seeing some of the devastation that you’ve been seeing. And we're going to do everything we can to continue to prevent it.  And I know that the vast majority of our international partners feel the same way.
"
937,HOG,"Q   Yes, thank you. There was some friendly banter between you two gentlemen on the tarmac today about red lines, and I'm wondering how much of a serious matter that actually became in your talks and will be in your talks to come tonight. President Obama has said it will take Iran at least a year to build a bomb. That's months longer than the Prime Minister believes.
"
938,HOG,"Mr. President, are you asking the Prime Minister to be more patient, to hold off for at least a year on any kind of military action against Iran?
"
939,HOG,"Mr. Prime Minister, has President Obama’s words -- have they convinced you that he is putting forth the credible military threat that you have repeatedly asked for, or there’s a need to go further? Thank you.
"
940,HOG,"PRESIDENT OBAMA:  Bibi, why don't you go -- take a first swing at this.
"
941,HOG,"PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU: Well, first of all, there are so many strips of different colors on the tarmac that we -- (laughter) -- we did have a joke about that.  But obviously this matter is no joke. It relates to our very existence and to something also that the President correctly identified as a grave strategic threat to the United States and to the peace and security of the world.
"
942,HOG,"I'm absolutely convinced that the President is determined to prevent Iran from getting nuclear weapons.  And I appreciate that. And I also appreciate something that he said, which I mentioned in my opening remarks, that the Jewish people have come back to their own country to be the masters of their own fate. And I appreciate the fact that the President has reaffirmed -- more than any other President -- Israel’s right and duty to defend itself, by itself, against any threat.  We just heard those important words now, and I think that sums up our -- I would say -- our common view.
"
943,HOG,"Iran is a grave threat to Israel, a grave threat to the world -- a nuclear Iran. The United States is committed to deal with it. Israel is committed to deal with it. We have different vulnerabilities, obviously, and different capabilities. We take that into account. But what we do maintain -- and the President I think is the first to do so -- is that Israel has a right to independently defend itself against any threat, including the Iranian threat.
"
944,HOG,"PRESIDENT OBAMA:  I think the only thing I would add is that our intelligence cooperation on this issue, the consultation between our militaries, our intelligence, is unprecedented, and there is not a lot of light, a lot of daylight between our countries’ assessments in terms of where Iran is right now.
"
945,HOG,"I think that what Bibi alluded to, which is absolutely correct, is each country has to make its own decisions when it comes to the awesome decision to engage in any kind of military action, and Israel is differently situated than the United States. And I would not expect that the Prime Minister would make a decision about his country’s security and defer that to any other country -- any more than the United States would defer our decisions about what was important for our national security.
"
946,HOG,"I have shared with Bibi, as I've said to the entire world, as I've said to the Iranian people and Iranian leaders, that I think there is time to resolve this issue diplomatically. The question is, will Iranian leadership seize that opportunity? Will they walk through that door?  
"
947,HOG,"And it would be in everybody’s interests -- not just Israel’s interests, not just the United States’ interests -- it would be in the interest of the Iranian people if this gets resolved diplomatically. Because the truth of the matter is, is that the most permanent solution to the Iranian situation is ultimately going to be their decision that it is not worth it for them to pursue nuclear weapons. That will be the lasting change. If we can get that, that's good for everybody, including Iran, because it would allow them to break out of the isolation that has hampered their society and their economic development for many years. 
"
948,HOG,"But I don't know whether they're going to be willing to take that step. And obviously, their past behavior indicates that, in the words of -- or a play on words on what Ronald Reagan said -- we can't even trust yet, much less verify. But we do have to test the proposition that this can be resolved diplomatically. And if it can't, then I’ve repeated to Bibi what I've said publicly, and that is, is that we will leave all options on the table in resolving it.
"
949,HOG,"Q    Mr. Prime Minister, do you agree or disagree with the President’s one-year assessment?
"
950,HOG,"PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU:  We have another question. 
"
951,HOG,"Q   Welcome, Mr. President. On your way back to Washington on Friday, what will you consider a successful visit? Convincing the Israeli leaders that they can rely on you on the Iranian issue, especially that they learned that there are differences between Israel and the United States concerning the enrichment of the Iranian -- or convincing both sides -- Israelis and the Palestinians -- to revive the floundering negotiation, reviving the peace process, the floundering peace process? 
"
952,HOG,"PRESIDENT OBAMA:  Well, my main goal on this trip has been to have an opportunity to speak directly to the Israeli people at a time when obviously what was already a pretty tough neighborhood has gotten tougher, and let them know that they've got a friend in the United States, that we have your back; that we consider Israel's security of extraordinary importance to us, not just because of the bonds between our peoples but also because of our own national security interest. 
"
953,HOG,"In that context, what I have also sought to achieve here is further consultations, building on what we've already discussed -- as Bibi has just formed a new government, as I am entering my second term -- that we continue to have close consultation around some of these shared interests that we've already discussed, Iran being obviously a prominent shared concern. I want to make sure that the Israeli people and the Israeli government consistently understand my thinking and how I'm approaching this problem. And I want to understand how the Israeli government and the Prime Minister is approaching this problem to make sure that there are no misunderstandings there.  With respect to the peace process, as I said, I'll have more to say about this tomorrow. But I think you are absolutely right that over the last year, year and a half, two years, two and a half years, we haven't gone forward. We haven't seen the kind of progress that we would like to see.  
"
954,HOG,"There's some elements of good news. I mean, the fact of the matter is, is that even with all that's been happening in the region, the Palestinian Authority has worked effectively in cooperation with the international community -- in part because of some of the training that we, the United States, provided -- to do its part in maintaining security in the West Bank. We have seen some progress when it comes to economic development and opportunity for the Palestinian people.  
"
955,HOG,"But the truth of the matter is trying to bring this to some sort of clear settlement, a solution that would allow Israelis to feel as if they've broken out of the current isolation that they're in, in this region, that would allow the incredible economic growth that's taking place inside this country to be a model for trade and commerce and development throughout the region at a time when all these other countries need technology and commerce and jobs for their young people, for Palestinians to feel a sense that they, too, are masters of their own fate, for Israel to feel that the possibilities of rockets raining down on their families has diminished -- that kind of solution we have not yet seen. 
"
956,HOG,"And so what I want to do is listen, hear from Prime Minister Netanyahu -- tomorrow, I'll have a chance to hear from Abu Mazen -- to get a sense from them, how do they see this process moving forward. What are the possibilities and what are the constraints, and how can the United States be helpful? And I purposely did not want to come here and make some big announcement that might not match up with what the realities and possibilities on the ground are.  I wanted to spend some time listening before I talked -- which my mother always taught me was a good idea.  
"
957,HOG,"And so, hopefully -- I'll consider it a success if when I go back on Friday, I'm able to say to myself I have a better understanding of what the constraints are, what the interests of the various parties are, and how the United States can play a constructive role in bringing about a lasting peace and two states living side by side in peace and security. 
"
958,HOG,"Q    Thank you, Mr. President; Mr. Prime Minister. Mr. President, I'm going to follow up a little bit on the peace process. You began your term, your first term, big fanfare -- Cairo speech to talk to the Muslim world, the decision to have a Middle East envoy early. You said you weren't going to let this slip to your second term.  We're in your second term with the Middle East peace process.  What went wrong?  Why are we further away from a two-state solution? I know you said you want to talk more about this tomorrow, but I am curious. What do you believe went wrong? Did you push Israel too hard? What do you wish you would have done differently?
"
959,HOG,"And, Mr. Prime Minister, I want to help out my colleague over here on the follow-up that he had, which had to do with do you accept the President's understanding that Iran is a year away when it comes to nuclear weapons? And another question I had for you --
"
960,HOG,"PRESIDENT OBAMA:  Chuck, how many have you got? Do you guys do this in the Israeli press -- you say you get one question and then you add like five? 
"
961,HOG,"Q    Well, I'm helping him. I'm helping him with his -- 
"
962,HOG,"PRESIDENT OBAMA: You see how the young lady from Channel One, she had one question. She was very well-behaved, Chuck. 
"
963,HOG,"Q    I had that one for you and -- (laughter) -- 
"
964,HOG,"PRIME NETANYAHU:  These are commuted questions they have. (Laughter.)  
"
965,HOG,"Q    Apparently -- I thought I had four questions.  
"
966,HOG,"PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU: Reiterations.  
"
967,HOG,"Q    Passover starts in a couple of days. (Laughter.) I get four questions, right?  
"
968,HOG,"PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU:  Look, this is not a Kosher question, but don't hog it. (Laughter.) 
"
969,HOG,"Q  I guess my question to you was going to be, why do you believe the Israeli people have not embraced President Obama the same way they embraced our last two U.S. Presidents?  Thank you. 
"
970,HOG,"PRESIDENT OBAMA: So you had to get a polling question in there right at the end? (Laughter.)  Chuck, I mean, you're just incorrigible. (Laughter.)  
"
971,HOG,"Well, look, the opening premise of your question was that having failed to achieve peace in the Middle East in my first term that I must have screwed up somehow. And I will tell you I hope I'm a better President now than when I first came into office, but my commitment was not to achieve a peace deal in my first year, or in my second year or my third year. That would have been nice. What I said was I was not going to wait to start on the issue until my second term, because I thought it was too important.  And that's exactly what I did.  
"
972,HOG,"I'm absolutely sure that there are a host of things that I could have done that would have been more deft and would have created better optics. But ultimately, this is a really hard problem. It’s been lingering for over six decades. And the parties involved have some profound interests that you can’t spin, you can’t smooth over. And it is a hard slog to work through all of these issues.  
"
973,HOG,"I will add that both parties also have politics, just like we do back home. There are a whole bunch of things that I’d like to do back in the United States that I didn’t get done in my first term. And I’m sure I could have been more deft there as well. But some of it’s just because it’s hard, and people disagree, and it takes I think a confluence of both good diplomatic work, but also timing, serendipity, things falling into place at the right time, the right players feeling that this is the moment to seize it.  
"
974,HOG,"And my goal here is just to make sure that the United State is a positive force in trying to create those opportunities as frequently as possible, and to be as clear as possible as to why we think that this is an important priority -- not only because of some Pollyanna-ish views about can’t we all get along and hold hands and sing “Kumbaya,” but because I actually believe that Israel’s security will be enhanced with a resolution to this issue. I believe that Palestinians will prosper and can channel their extraordinary energies and entrepreneurship in more positive ways with a resolution to this issue.  The entire region I think will be healthier with a resolution to this issue.  
"
975,HOG,"So I’m going to keep on making that argument. And I will admit that, frankly, sometimes it would be easier not to make the argument and to avoid the question, precisely because it’s hard. That’s not the approach that I’ve tried to take.  
"
976,HOG,"And there have probably been times where, when I’ve made statements about what I think needs to happen, the way it gets filtered through our press -- it may be interpreted in ways that get Israelis nervous, just like there are folks back home who sometimes get nervous about areas where they aren't sure exactly where I stand on things. That's why I always like the opportunity to talk directly to you guys.  Hopefully, you'll show the live film, as opposed to the edited version.  
"
977,HOG,"With that, I think you've got four questions to answer, Bibi. (Laughter.) 
"
978,HOG,"PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU:  I think that there's a misunderstanding about time. If Iran decides to go for a nuclear weapon -- that is, to actually manufacture the weapon -- then it probably -- then it would take them about a year. I think that's correct. They could defer that a long time but still get through the enrichment process -- that is, to make a weapon you need two things; you need enriched uranium of a critical amount and then you need a weapon. You can't have the weapon without the enriched uranium, but you can have the enriched uranium without the weapon.  
"
979,HOG,"Iran right now is enriching uranium. It’s pursuing it. It hasn’t yet reached the red line that I had described in my speech at the U.N. -- they're getting closer, though. 
"
980,HOG,"And the question of manufacturing the weapon is a different thing. The President said correctly that we have -- on these issues that are a little arcane, they sound a little detailed to you -- but on these matters we share information and we have a common assessment. We have a common assessment. 
"
981,HOG,"In any case, Iran gets to an immunity zone when they get through the enrichment process, in our view -- in our view -- and whatever time is left, there's not a lot of time. And every day that passes diminishes it. But we do have a common assessment. On the schedules, on intelligence, we share that intelligence and we don't have any argument about it. I think it's important to state that clearly. 
"
982,HOG,"I think that people should get to know President Obama the way I've gotten to know. And I think you've just heard something that is very meaningful. It may have escaped you, but it hasn't escaped me. And that is the President announced that in addition to all the aid that his administration has provided -- including Iron Dome, including defense funding for Israel during very difficult times -- he has announced that we are going to begin talks on another 10-year process arrangement to ensure American military assistance to Israel. I think this is very significant.       And I want to express my thanks for everything that you have done. And I want to thank you also for that statement you just made. I think it's very, very important.  
"
983,HOG,"So I think Israelis will judge this by the unfolding events and by what is happening, what is actually taking place. And for thi -- you know, there's a very simple answer to your question -- the gentleman from NBC, right? Yes.  Well, for this, you need, you see, a second term as President and a third term as Prime Minister. That really fixes things. (Laughter.) 
"
984,HOG,"PRESIDENT OBAMA: All right, thank you very much, everybody. (Applause.)     ####

985,HOG,"News conference video courtesy of the C-SPAN Video Archive.      
"
986,HOG,"....Syria, well, the response has been -- or my response would be that, to the extent possible, I want to make sure that we're working as an international community to deal with this problem, because I think it’s a world problem, not simply a United States problem, or an Israel problem, or a Turkish problem. It’s a world problem when tens of thousands of people are being slaughtered, including innocent women and children.  
"
987,HOG,"And so we will continue to work in an international framework to try to bring about the kind of change that's necessary in Syria. Secretary Kerry has been working nonstop since he came into his current position to try to help mobilize and organize our overall efforts, and we will continue to push every lever that we have to try to bring about a resolution inside of Syria that respects the rights and the safety and security of all people, regardless of whatever sectarian lines currently divide Syria.
"
988,HOG,"Last point I'll make, which is probably obvious, is this is not easy. When you start seeing a civil war that has sectarian elements to it, and you’ve got a repressive government that is intent on maintaining power, and you have mistrust that has broken out along sectarian lines, and you have an opposition that has not had the opportunity or time to organize itself both politically as well as militarily, then you end up seeing some of the devastation that you’ve been seeing. And we're going to do everything we can to continue to prevent it.  And I know that the vast majority of our international partners feel the same way.
"
989,HOG,"Q   Yes, thank you. There was some friendly banter between you two gentlemen on the tarmac today about red lines, and I'm wondering how much of a serious matter that actually became in your talks and will be in your talks to come tonight. President Obama has said it will take Iran at least a year to build a bomb. That's months longer than the Prime Minister believes.
"
990,HOG,"Mr. President, are you asking the Prime Minister to be more patient, to hold off for at least a year on any kind of military action against Iran?
"
991,HOG,"Mr. Prime Minister, has President Obama’s words -- have they convinced you that he is putting forth the credible military threat that you have repeatedly asked for, or there’s a need to go further? Thank you.
"
992,HOG,"PRESIDENT OBAMA:  Bibi, why don't you go -- take a first swing at this.
"
993,HOG,"PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU: Well, first of all, there are so many strips of different colors on the tarmac that we -- (laughter) -- we did have a joke about that.  But obviously this matter is no joke. It relates to our very existence and to something also that the President correctly identified as a grave strategic threat to the United States and to the peace and security of the world.
"
994,HOG,"I'm absolutely convinced that the President is determined to prevent Iran from getting nuclear weapons.  And I appreciate that. And I also appreciate something that he said, which I mentioned in my opening remarks, that the Jewish people have come back to their own country to be the masters of their own fate. And I appreciate the fact that the President has reaffirmed -- more than any other President -- Israel’s right and duty to defend itself, by itself, against any threat.  We just heard those important words now, and I think that sums up our -- I would say -- our common view.
"
995,HOG,"Iran is a grave threat to Israel, a grave threat to the world -- a nuclear Iran. The United States is committed to deal with it. Israel is committed to deal with it. We have different vulnerabilities, obviously, and different capabilities. We take that into account. But what we do maintain -- and the President I think is the first to do so -- is that Israel has a right to independently defend itself against any threat, including the Iranian threat.

It may have escaped you, but it hasn't escaped me. And that is the President announced that in addition to all the aid that his administration has provided -- including Iron Dome, including defense funding for Israel during very difficult times -- he has announced that we are going to begin talks on another 10-year process arrangement to ensure American military assistance to Israel. I think this is very significant.       And I want to express my thanks for everything that you have done. And I want to thank you also for that statement you just made. I think it's very, very important.

1037,HOG,"News conference video courtesy of the C-SPAN Video Archive.      ....Syria, well, the response has been -- or my response would be that, to the extent possible, I want to make sure that we're working as an international community to deal with this problem, because I think it’s a world problem, not simply a United States problem, or an Israel problem, or a Turkish problem. It’s a world problem when tens of thousands of people are being slaughtered, including innocent women and children.  And so we will continue to work in an international framework to try to bring about the kind of change that's necessary in Syria. Secretary Kerry has been working nonstop since he came into his current position to try to help mobilize and organize our overall efforts, and we will continue to push every lever that we have to try to bring about a resolution inside of Syria that respects the rights and the safety and security of all people, regardless of whatever sectarian lines currently divide Syria.Last point I'll make, which is probably obvious, is this is not easy. When you start seeing a civil war that has sectarian elements to it, and you’ve got a repressive government that is intent on maintaining power, and you have mistrust that has broken out along sectarian lines, and you have an opposition that has not had the opportunity or time to organize itself both politically as well as militarily, then you end up seeing some of the devastation that you’ve been seeing. And we're going to do everything we can to continue to prevent it.  And I know that the vast majority of our international partners feel the same way.Q   Yes, thank you. There was some friendly banter between you two gentlemen on the tarmac today about red lines, and I'm wondering how much of a serious matter that actually became in your talks and will be in your talks to come tonight. President Obama has said it will take Iran at least a year to build a bomb. That's months longer than the Prime Minister believes.Mr. President, are you asking the Prime Minister to be more patient, to hold off for at least a year on any kind of military action against Iran?Mr. Prime Minister, has President Obama’s words -- have they convinced you that he is putting forth the credible military threat that you have repeatedly asked for, or there’s a need to go further? Thank you.PRESIDENT OBAMA:  Bibi, why don't you go -- take a first swing at this.PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU: Well, first of all, there are so many strips of different colors on the tarmac that we -- (laughter) -- we did have a joke about that.  But obviously this matter is no joke. It relates to our very existence and to something also that the President correctly identified as a grave strategic threat to the United States and to the peace and security of the world.I'm absolutely convinced that the President is determined to prevent Iran from getting nuclear weapons.  And I appreciate that. And I also appreciate something that he said, which I mentioned in my opening remarks, that the Jewish people have come back to their own country to be the masters of their own fate. And I appreciate the fact that the President has reaffirmed -- more than any other President -- Israel’s right and duty to defend itself, by itself, against any threat.  We just heard those important words now, and I think that sums up our -- I would say -- our common view.Iran is a grave threat to Israel, a grave threat to the world -- a nuclear Iran. The United States is committed to deal with it. Israel is committed to deal with it. We have different vulnerabilities, obviously, and different capabilities. We take that into account. But what we do maintain -- and the President I think is the first to do so -- is that Israel has a right to independently defend itself against any threat, including the Iranian threat.PRESIDENT OBAMA:  I think the only thing I would add is that our intelligence cooperation on this issue, the consultation between our militaries, our intelligence, is unprecedented, and there is not a lot of light, a lot of daylight between our countries’ assessments in terms of where Iran is right now.I think that what Bibi alluded to, which is absolutely correct, is each country has to make its own decisions when it comes to the awesome decision to engage in any kind of military action, and Israel is differently situated than the United States. And I would not expect that the Prime Minister would make a decision about his country’s security and defer that to any other country -- any more than the United States would defer our decisions about what was important for our national security.I have shared with Bibi, as I've said to the entire world, as I've said to the Iranian people and Iranian leaders, that I think there is time to resolve this issue diplomatically. The question is, will Iranian leadership seize that opportunity? Will they walk through that door?  And it would be in everybody’s interests -- not just Israel’s interests, not just the United States’ interests -- it would be in the interest of the Iranian people if this gets resolved diplomatically. Because the truth of the matter is, is that the most permanent solution to the Iranian situation is ultimately going to be their decision that it is not worth it for them to pursue nuclear weapons. That will be the lasting change. If we can get that, that's good for everybody, including Iran, because it would allow them to break out of the isolation that has hampered their society and their economic development for many years. But I don't know whether they're going to be willing to take that step. And obviously, their past behavior indicates that, in the words of -- or a play on words on what Ronald Reagan said -- we can't even trust yet, much less verify. But we do have to test the proposition that this can be resolved diplomatically. And if it can't, then I’ve repeated to Bibi what I've said publicly, and that is, is that we will leave all options on the table in resolving it.Q    Mr. Prime Minister, do you agree or disagree with the President’s one-year assessment?PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU:  We have another question. Q   Welcome, Mr. President. On your way back to Washington on Friday, what will you consider a successful visit? Convincing the Israeli leaders that they can rely on you on the Iranian issue, especially that they learned that there are differences between Israel and the United States concerning the enrichment of the Iranian -- or convincing both sides -- Israelis and the Palestinians -- to revive the floundering negotiation, reviving the peace process, the floundering peace process? PRESIDENT OBAMA:  Well, my main goal on this trip has been to have an opportunity to speak directly to the Israeli people at a time when obviously what was already a pretty tough neighborhood has gotten tougher, and let them know that they've got a friend in the United States, that we have your back; that we consider Israel's security of extraordinary importance to us, not just because of the bonds between our peoples but also because of our own national security interest. In that context, what I have also sought to achieve here is further consultations, building on what we've already discussed -- as Bibi has just formed a new government, as I am entering my second term -- that we continue to have close consultation around some of these shared interests that we've already discussed, Iran being obviously a prominent shared concern. I want to make sure that the Israeli people and the Israeli government consistently understand my thinking and how I'm approaching this problem. And I want to understand how the Israeli government and the Prime Minister is approaching this problem to make sure that there are no misunderstandings there.  With respect to the peace process, as I said, I'll have more to say about this tomorrow. But I think you are absolutely right that over the last year, year and a half, two years, two and a half years, we haven't gone forward. We haven't seen the kind of progress that we would like to see.  There's some elements of good news. I mean, the fact of the matter is, is that even with all that's been happening in the region, the Palestinian Authority has worked effectively in cooperation with the international community -- in part because of some of the training that we, the United States, provided -- to do its part in maintaining security in the West Bank. We have seen some progress when it comes to economic development and opportunity for the Palestinian people.  But the truth of the matter is trying to bring this to some sort of clear settlement, a solution that would allow Israelis to feel as if they've broken out of the current isolation that they're in, in this region, that would allow the incredible economic growth that's taking place inside this country to be a model for trade and commerce and development throughout the region at a time when all these other countries need technology and commerce and jobs for their young people, for Palestinians to feel a sense that they, too, are masters of their own fate, for Israel to feel that the possibilities of rockets raining down on their families has diminished -- that kind of solution we have not yet seen. And so what I want to do is listen, hear from Prime Minister Netanyahu -- tomorrow, I'll have a chance to hear from Abu Mazen -- to get a sense from them, how do they see this process moving forward. What are the possibilities and what are the constraints, and how can the United States be helpful? And I purposely did not want to come here and make some big announcement that might not match up with what the realities and possibilities on the ground are.  I wanted to spend some time listening before I talked -- which my mother always taught me was a good idea.  And so, hopefully -- I'll consider it a success if when I go back on Friday, I'm able to say to myself I have a better understanding of what the constraints are, what the interests of the various parties are, and how the United States can play a constructive role in bringing about a lasting peace and two states living side by side in peace and security. Q    Thank you, Mr. President; Mr. Prime Minister. Mr. President, I'm going to follow up a little bit on the peace process. You began your term, your first term, big fanfare -- Cairo speech to talk to the Muslim world, the decision to have a Middle East envoy early. You said you weren't going to let this slip to your second term.  We're in your second term with the Middle East peace process.  What went wrong?  Why are we further away from a two-state solution? I know you said you want to talk more about this tomorrow, but I am curious. What do you believe went wrong? Did you push Israel too hard? What do you wish you would have done differently?And, Mr. Prime Minister, I want to help out my colleague over here on the follow-up that he had, which had to do with do you accept the President's understanding that Iran is a year away when it comes to nuclear weapons? And another question I had for you --PRESIDENT OBAMA:  Chuck, how many have you got? Do you guys do this in the Israeli press -- you say you get one question and then you add like five? Q    Well, I'm helping him. I'm helping him with his -- PRESIDENT OBAMA: You see how the young lady from Channel One, she had one question. She was very well-behaved, Chuck. Q    I had that one for you and -- (laughter) -- PRIME NETANYAHU:  These are commuted questions they have. (Laughter.)  Q    Apparently -- I thought I had four questions.  PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU: Reiterations.  Q    Passover starts in a couple of days. (Laughter.) I get four questions, right?  PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU:  Look, this is not a Kosher question, but don't hog it. (Laughter.) Q  I guess my question to you was going to be, why do you believe the Israeli people have not embraced President Obama the same way they embraced our last two U.S. Presidents?  Thank you. PRESIDENT OBAMA: So you had to get a polling question in there right at the end? (Laughter.)  Chuck, I mean, you're just incorrigible. (Laughter.)  Well, look, the opening premise of your question was that having failed to achieve peace in the Middle East in my first term that I must have screwed up somehow. And I will tell you I hope I'm a better President now than when I first came into office, but my commitment was not to achieve a peace deal in my first year, or in my second year or my third year. That would have been nice. What I said was I was not going to wait to start on the issue until my second term, because I thought it was too important.  And that's exactly what I did.  I'm absolutely sure that there are a host of things that I could have done that would have been more deft and would have created better optics. But ultimately, this is a really hard problem. It’s been lingering for over six decades. And the parties involved have some profound interests that you can’t spin, you can’t smooth over. And it is a hard slog to work through all of these issues.  I will add that both parties also have politics, just like we do back home. There are a whole bunch of things that I’d like to do back in the United States that I didn’t get done in my first term. And I’m sure I could have been more deft there as well. But some of it’s just because it’s hard, and people disagree, and it takes I think a confluence of both good diplomatic work, but also timing, serendipity, things falling into place at the right time, the right players feeling that this is the moment to seize it.  And my goal here is just to make sure that the United State is a positive force in trying to create those opportunities as frequently as possible, and to be as clear as possible as to why we think that this is an important priority -- not only because of some Pollyanna-ish views about can’t we all get along and hold hands and sing “Kumbaya,” but because I actually believe that Israel’s security will be enhanced with a resolution to this issue. I believe that Palestinians will prosper and can channel their extraordinary energies and entrepreneurship in more positive ways with a resolution to this issue.  The entire region I think will be healthier with a resolution to this issue.  So I’m going to keep on making that argument. And I will admit that, frankly, sometimes it would be easier not to make the argument and to avoid the question, precisely because it’s hard. That’s not the approach that I’ve tried to take.  And there have probably been times where, when I’ve made statements about what I think needs to happen, the way it gets filtered through our press -- it may be interpreted in ways that get Israelis nervous, just like there are folks back home who sometimes get nervous about areas where they aren't sure exactly where I stand on things. That's why I always like the opportunity to talk directly to you guys.  Hopefully, you'll show the live film, as opposed to the edited version.  With that, I think you've got four questions to answer, Bibi. (Laughter.) PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU:  I think that there's a misunderstanding about time. If Iran decides to go for a nuclear weapon -- that is, to actually manufacture the weapon -- then it probably -- then it would take them about a year. I think that's correct. They could defer that a long time but still get through the enrichment process -- that is, to make a weapon you need two things; you need enriched uranium of a critical amount and then you need a weapon. You can't have the weapon without the enriched uranium, but you can have the enriched uranium without the weapon.  Iran right now is enriching uranium. It’s pursuing it. It hasn’t yet reached the red line that I had described in my speech at the U.N. -- they're getting closer, though. And the question of manufacturing the weapon is a different thing. The President said correctly that we have -- on these issues that are a little arcane, they sound a little detailed to you -- but on these matters we share information and we have a common assessment. We have a common assessment. In any case, Iran gets to an immunity zone when they get through the enrichment process, in our view -- in our view -- and whatever time is left, there's not a lot of time. And every day that passes diminishes it. But we do have a common assessment. On the schedules, on intelligence, we share that intelligence and we don't have any argument about it. I think it's important to state that clearly. I think that people should get to know President Obama the way I've gotten to know. And I think you've just heard something that is very meaningful. It may have escaped you, but it hasn't escaped me. And that is the President announced that in addition to all the aid that his administration has provided -- including Iron Dome, including defense funding for Israel during very difficult times -- he has announced that we are going to begin talks on another 10-year process arrangement to ensure American military assistance to Israel. I think this is very significant.       And I want to express my thanks for everything that you have done. And I want to thank you also for that statement you just made. I think it's very, very important.  So I think Israelis will judge this by the unfolding events and by what is happening, what is actually taking place. And for thi -- you know, there's a very simple answer to your question -- the gentleman from NBC, right? Yes.  Well, for this, you need, you see, a second term as President and a third term as Prime Minister. That really fixes things.

1104,HOG,"Trade: Europe's Parliament has moved to revitalize the continent's weak economy by clearing the way for a free-trade agreement with the U.S. A baby step, yes, but if it succeeds, it'll be the mother of all trade pacts.By a vote of 526-94, the European Parliament approved its first resolution calling for talks on a U.S.-European free-trade agreement, starting in the first half of 2013.""We wanted to send a strong political signal in favor of opening negotiations with the United States in order to create a real trans-Atlantic market with enormous opportunities for growth,"" said EU's Vital Moreira before the vote.It was a smart move coming from a continent that has long protected its industries through high tariffs and tangled regulations. It also comes just as a bill urging U.S.-EU free trade, ""The Economic Freedom Alliance Act,"" is gaining support in Congress.It will take time, but uniting the world's two largest advanced economies will pay huge dividends.Two-way trade between the U.S. and Europe in 2011 stood at $1 trillion, and free trade will heap another $200 billion onto both economies.Thousands of jobs will come of it and consumers will be in hog heaven, with Americans buying duty-free Italian Guccis, Greek seafood or German BMWs while Europeans will snap up no-tariff Texas-made computers, Ohio-made drill bits and California almonds — to give just a few examples.""The EU has taken a major step toward upgrading the pivotal trans-Atlantic relationship,"" Rep. Devin Nunes, a California Republican who sponsored the U.S. bill, told IBD. ""An agreement for free and fair trade would greatly benefit the economies on both sides, binding Europe and America closer together through peaceful commerce.""That's progress, and with a troubled Europe now taking its first step, it can't start soon enough.
"
1105,HOG,"Who exactly were the rich who, as the president said, were not ""paying their fair share""? The rapper Jay-Z (net worth: nearly $500 million)? The actor Johnny Depp (2011 income: $50 million)? Neither seems to have heard the president's earlier warning that, ""at a certain point you've made enough money.""Could both zillionaires simply have quit making money at $10 million — and thereby given their poorer audiences a break on ticket prices?With all the talk of raising taxes on the supposedly conservative wannabes who make $250,000 per year, why not additionally levy a $3 surcharge on discretionary tickets for movies, concerts and sporting events to ""spread the wealth"" from multimillionaires?That way, LeBron James (approximate annual earnings: $53 million) or Oliver Stone (net worth: approximately $50 million) might at last begin to ""level the playing field.""Is Michael Moore (net worth: approximately $50 million) a one-tenth-of-one-percenter? If so, why do mansion-living movie directors such as Moore and Stone need state subsidies and tax breaks to produce their films, when most states are nearly as insolvent as the federal government?Warren Buffett likewise did not heed the president's advice that after 2008 it was not the time to profit. Did he pay any attention to Obama's additional warning that, ""If you own a business, you didn't build that""? Apparently not.Otherwise, Buffett would not think that his own expertise and hard work had built Berkshire Hathaway, or that he has the right to leave his $50 billion fortune to nonprofit institutions of his choice — thereby shorting the Internal Revenue Service billions of dollars in lost estate taxes.With a trillion-dollar-plus annual federal deficit, either the Department of Housing and Urban Development or the Department of Health and Human Services surely could use Buffett's loot far more than the already well-endowed Gates Foundation.If the country is going to turn redistributionist, then we might as well do so whole-hog — given that eight of the wealthiest 10 counties in America voted for Obama. Why not limit mortgage-interest deductions to just one loan under $100,000 — while ending tax breaks altogether for second and third vacation houses?Under the present system, the beleaguered 99% are subsidizing the abodes of Hollywood and Silicon Valley ""millionaires and billionaires"" — many of whom themselves have been railing against the 1%. Should the government provide tens of thousands of dollars in tax breaks for a blue-state one-percenter to live in tony Palo Alto or Newport Beach when there are plenty of fine homes far cheaper and sitting empty not far away in Stockton and Bakersfield?Blue states usually have far higher state income taxes that are used as deductions to reduce what is owed on federal income tax. Why should working folks in Nevada or Texas have to pay their fair share, while Wall Streeters get huge federal write-offs from their New York or Connecticut state income taxes?With the new obsessions over income and net worth, we might as well also means-test all federal programs. Should anyone — do we remember Solyndra? — be eligible for federal cash loans if he makes over $250,000 per year?Why would affirmative action apply to millionaires like the offspring of Eric Holder, Susan Rice or, for that matter, Barack Obama, while excluding the destitute children of Appalachian coal miners and the poor clingers of Pennsylvania?Remember the revolving door that Barack Obama once promised to end? The former head of his Office of Management and Budget, Peter Orszag, used his title and insider contacts to walk right into a Citigroup fat-cat banker's job that pays him an estimated $2 million to $3 million a year.Clinton administration apparatchiks such as Jamie Gorelick, James Johnson and Franklin Raines — without much of any banking experience — reaped millions of dollars working at Fannie Mae as it went nearly bankrupt.If you leave government and immediately make more than $1 million, why not pay a 50% surcharge on your income for five years — given that ""somebody else made that happen""? Why does Google have tax havens in the Caribbean, and why do six-figure-income college presidents have their taxes paid by their universities?For much of 2012, Obama waged a veritable class war against conservatives, as if they were all right-wing clones of Donald Trump and the Koch brothers. But modern Democrats — Nancy Pelosi, George Soros, Steven Spielberg, Brian Williams and Oprah Winfrey — are as likely to be very wealthy as are Republicans, who increasingly better represent small-business owners desperately struggling to become affluent.Next time around, Republicans might remind us of that paradox by nominating a small-business scrapper, who — unlike millionaires such as Al Gore, John Kerry or Barack Obama — did not go to prep school and the Ivy League. And they might find better ways for those in academia, entertainment, sports, big law and the media to pay their fair share.

1106,HOG,"Corn tumbled more than 1% to a seven-week low Wednesday as the government's assessment of crop damage from the worst drought in half a century fell short of trade expectations.Soybean futures soared more than 2% for the biggest daily gain in about two weeks, snapping a five-day losing streak after the USDA cut its estimate of the crop in the world's top grain-exporting nation.The department also cut its yield estimate, pouring cold water on some trade expectations for an improvement after August rains in the northern and eastern Midwestern farm belt.Soybeans FIX were on track to test the record $17.94-3/4 hit last week by the spot month. Traders said even higher prices were needed to temper demand, with the stocks-to-use ratio set to be the lowest in nearly five decades.Demand for corn, on the other hand, has diminished sharply after prices hit an all-time high of $8.49 per bushel Aug. 10, with U.S. livestock producers, particularly hog farmers, rushing to slaughter their animals due to record feed costs and to pasture damage from the drought.""Corn numbers show we were rationing demand pretty aggressively in the old crop,"" said Don Roose, president of U.S. Commodities in West Des Moines, Iowa.CBOT new-crop December corn fell 1.0% to $7.70-1/4 per bushel.

"
1111,HOG,"No joke.
"
1112,HOG,"True, Rubio isn't going to Iowa until Saturday, which means it will be much closer by then, only 1,449 days before the 2016 election. And even less time until the nation's first primary caucus. Oh, look! Those first local caucuses to start choosing the GOP nominee will be in Iowa in January of 2016.
"
1113,HOG,"The alleged reason for the 41-year-old bilingual Republican star's visit to Iowa is a fundraiser. Remember what those are? Obama did quite a few of them the last couple of years, charging upwards of $40,000 per person.
"
1114,HOG,"The Saturday event won't cost Iowans that much. After all, they're conservatives. The occasion is to celebrate the birthday of Republican Gov. Terry Branstad, who turns 66 that day. Branstad is his state's 39th and 42d governor, making him Iowa's longest-serving governor ever. He's ruled the statehouse from 1983 until 1999 and again since 2011.

"
1116,HOG,"This time he did not endorse anyone in the Republican field. He did, however, have very nice things to say about Rick Santorum, who ended up eking out a narrow caucus win 10 months ago. A lot of good it did him.
"
1117,HOG,"Politicians of either party don't go to Iowa these days to campaign for the caucuses. No, nothing like that. They go there for some other ostensible reason, like a fundraiser for media exposure and to curry favor with the popular governor and his politically-active followers. 
"
1118,HOG,"Mitt Romney didn't make it to Branstad's party last year, but he did spend the last several years largely beneath the public radar screen traveling around doing fundraiser favors as the star speaking attraction for other state and local pols, who need money. Ronald Reagan also spent years doing this kind of duty. One result: In his 1984 reelection, the incumbent Reagan captured 49 states, considerably better than the current incumbent.

1121,HOG,"He'll pose for countless cellphone pictures. Many of the senator's new friends will likely get a Rubio thank you letter next week. Maybe even phone calls down the road. And he'll stay in touch as Obama's endless second term unfolds and eventually expires.
"
1122,HOG,"Other Republicans will likely show up too during the next 18 months or so. The party has an incredibly deep bench of governors. A Chris Christie bid is likely DOA after his Sandy suck-up to Obama. But there's Scott Walker, Nikki Haley, John Kasich, Bobby Jindal, Susanna Martinez, Rick Perry, among many. 
"
1123,HOG,"Once he's settled into Indianapolis, newly-elected Gov. Mike Pence could show up. Maybe Sen. John Thune or Kelly Ayotte, in case Republicans haven't had enough of an ex-senator in the White House.
"
1124,HOG,"It's not that any of them have actually decided to run in 2016. It's just that a massive undertaking like a presidential campaign requires such extensive and meticulous spadework that they have to start far out just to have the option of realistically deciding when the time comes.

"
1345,HOG,"Next to the Miss Iowa Hog title, the most coveted temporal honor in the Hawkeye state may be the political endorsement of the state's largest newspaper, the Des Moines Register. Sen. Barack Obama won it in 2008, as the Democrat presidential candidate has for 40 straight years.
"
1346,HOG,"But not this time. They too have had it with the Real Good talker.
"
1347,HOG,"Over the weekend the Register went with Republican Mitt Romney, as he explained his economic program:
"
1348,HOG,"""Our discussion repeatedly circled back to the nation’s single most important challenge: pulling the economy out of the doldrums, getting more Americans back in the workforce in meaningful jobs with promising futures, and getting the federal government on a track to balance the budget in a bipartisan manner that the country demands.
"
1349,HOG,"""Which candidate could forge the compromises in Congress to achieve these goals? When the question is framed in those terms, Mitt Romney emerges the stronger candidate.
"
1350,HOG,"""The former governor and business executive has a strong record of achievement in both the private and the public sectors. He was an accomplished governor in a liberal state. He founded and ran a successful business that turned around failing companies. He successfully managed the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City.
"
1351,HOG,"""Romney has made rebuilding the economy his No. 1 campaign priority — and rightly so.
"
1352,HOG,"""The president’s best efforts to resuscitate the stumbling economy have fallen short. Nothing indicates it would change with a second term in the White House.""
"
1353,HOG,"As we wrote right here the other day, newspaper endorsements are fading as major political influencers. Recent polls in many places have shown the Romney-Ryan ticket in a very close contest with Obama and his increasingly loony uncle from Delaware. 
"
1354,HOG,"It's quite possible for whatever reasons that many poll participants are lying to pollsters about their ballot intentions, as has happened in previous elections among white and black candidates. And as happened last June in the Wisconsin recall effort against Gov. Scott Walker. 
"
1355,HOG,"Combined exit poll results from voters indicated it was a close contest. In the end, of course, it wasn't, with Walker winning by a larger margin than his original election in 2010.  
"
1356,HOG,"Romney’s debate performances established his bona fides as a credible president, demolishing the aloof, ignorant image built with a couple hundred million dollars in Obama ads all summer and thrusting the former state chief executive into statistical ties in many places.
"
1357,HOG,"Historically, undecideds tend to break for the challenger late in a race like this. And even though local newspapers have less clout, in that squeaker environment it only takes a relatively few voters to follow a newspaper’s recommendation to tip the balance for Iowa’s six electoral votes or Wisconsin’s 10 or even Ohio’s 18.
"
1358,HOG,"It’s also come down to only a handful of states with eight days left—Ohio, Iowa, Wisconsin, Florida and Colorado. It’s allegedly so close that they’re even still seeking New Hampshire’s puny four electoral votes. And it’s come down to a handful of issues too. 
"
1359,HOG,"Obama has been silent on any detailed agenda for a second term, other than vague talk about finishing the job. With no federal budget for three years, the national debt passing $16 trillion and 23 million Americans under- or unemployed, ‘finishing the job’ can sound more like a threat than a positive promise.
"
1360,HOG,"Responding to mounting criticism, Obama last week began waving from the podium a glossy brochure of vague programs, most of them from the current term.
"
1361,HOG,"Romney has been giving a series of speeches on various issues the last several months. Foreign affairs here. National security issues right here. The debt owed to the nation's veterans here. Unwavering support for Israel here. The other day he addressed the campaign’s most important issue again, the economy.
"
1362,HOG,"As usual, we have the full text down below. Romney first focuses first on a withering critique of Obama’s term:
"
1363,HOG,"""Four years ago, candidate Obama spoke to the scale of the times. Today, he shrinks from it, trying instead to distract our attention from the biggest issues to the smallest--from characters on Sesame Street and silly word games to misdirected personal attacks he knows are false. The President's campaign falls far short of the magnitude of the times.""
"
1364,HOG,"Romney’s point is that not only has the Democrat failed to live up to his own promises, including creation of nine million new jobs with the vast stimulus spending that helped grow national debt by nearly $6 trillion.
"
1365,HOG,"But that Obama’s penchant for more government, more spending, more borrowing, more regulations has made the attempted economic recovery weaker than any since World War II. 
"
1366,HOG,"Romney provides numerous statistics about the stagnant economy. Perhaps the most depressing is that 47 million Americans are now receiving food stamps, 15 million more than when Obama took the oath 1,378 days ago. That works out to almost 11,000 new food stamp recipients every day every week since Aretha Franklin sang the ex-state senator into office.
"
1367,HOG,"We’ll be publishing here soon an updated version of Obama’s standard stump speech for comparison. Meanwhile, we suggest you scroll through Romney’s remarks here. It’s an excellent summary of his plans and his Obama critique for the campaign’s closing days.
"
1368,HOG,"“This election,” Romney asserts, “is a choice between the status quo -- going forward with the same policies of the last four years -- or instead, choosing real change, change that offers promise, promise that the future will be better than the past.” Now, here’s the full Romney:

"
1372,HOG,"Mitt Romney's gains grow, Obama's total slips on new Rove Electoral MapGov. Mitt Romney's Address on the U.S. Economy
"
1373,HOG,"Thank you all.  It’s great to be back in Iowa. And don't think that this is the last time you are going to see Paul Ryan and me, because you Iowans may well be the ones who decide what kind of America we will have, what kind of life our families will have. 
"
1374,HOG,"The choice you make this November will shape great things, historic things, and those things will determine the most intimate and important aspects of every American life and every American family. This is an election about America, and it is an election about the American family. 
"
1375,HOG,"All elections matter. This one matters a great deal. Over the years of our nation's history, choices our fellow citizens have made have changed the country's course--they were turning points of defining consequence.
"
1376,HOG,"We are at a turning point today. Our national debt and liabilities threaten to crush our future, our economy struggles under the weight of government and fails to create essential growth and employment. 
"
1377,HOG,"At the same time, emerging powers seek to shape the world in their image--China with its model of authoritarianism and, in a very different way, Jihadists with Sharia, repression, and terror for the world.
"
1378,HOG,"This is an election of consequence.  Our campaign is about big things, because we happen to believe that America faces big challenges.  We recognize this is a year with a big choice, and the American people want to see big changes.  And together we can bring real change to this country.
"
1379,HOG,"Four years ago, candidate Obama spoke to the scale of the times. Today, he shrinks from it, trying instead to distract our attention from the biggest issues to the smallest--from characters on Sesame Street and silly word games to misdirected personal attacks he knows are false.
"
1380,HOG,"The President's campaign falls far short of the magnitude of the times. And the presidency of the last four years has fallen far short of the promises of his last campaign. Four years ago, America voted for a post-partisan president, but they have seen the most political of presidents, and a Washington in gridlock because of it. 
"
1381,HOG,"President Obama promised to bring us together, but at every turn, he has sought to divide and demonize. He promised to cut the deficit in half, but he doubled it. And his budget?  It failed to win a single vote, Republican or Democrat, in either the House or the Senate. He said he would reform Medicare and Social Security and save them from pending insolvency, but he shrunk from proposing any solution at all. 
"
1382,HOG,"And then, where are the jobs?  Where are the 9 million more jobs that President Obama promised his stimulus would have created by now?  They are in China, Mexico, and Canada and in countries that have made themselves more attractive for entrepreneurs and business and investment, even as President Obama's policies have made it less attractive for them here. 
"
1383,HOG,"And so today, his campaign tries to deflect and detract, to minimize the failures, and to make this election about small shiny objects. 
"
1384,HOG,"But this election matters more than that. It matters to your family.
"
1385,HOG,"It matters to the senior who needs to get an appointment with a medical specialist but is told by one receptionist after another that the doctor isn't taking any new Medicare patients, because Medicare has been slashed to pay for Obamacare.
"
1386,HOG,"It matters to the man from Waukesha, Wisconsin I spoke with several days ago.  In what were supposed to be his best work years, he used to have a job at $25 an hour with benefits and now has one at $8 an hour, without benefits. 
"
1387,HOG,"It matters to the college student, graduating this spring, with 10 to 20 thousand dollars in student debt, who now learns that she also will be paying for 50 thousand dollars in government debt, a burden that will put the American Dream beyond her reach.
"
1388,HOG,"It matters for the child in a failing school, unable to go to the school of his parent's choosing, because the teacher's union that funds the President's campaign opposes school choice. 
"
1389,HOG,"The President's campaign has a slogan: it is ""forward."" But to the 23 million Americans struggling to find a good job, these last four years feel a lot more like ""backward."" We cannot afford four more years like the last four years.
"
1390,HOG,"This election is about big things--like the education of our children, the value of our homes, the take home pay from our jobs, the price of the gasoline we buy, and the choices we have in our healthcare. It is also about the big things that determine these things--like the growth of the economy, the strength of our military, our dependence on foreign oil, and America's leadership in the world. 
"
1391,HOG,"President Obama frequently reminds us that he inherited a troubled economy. But a troubled economy is not all that President Obama inherited. He inherited the greatest nation in the history of the earth. He inherited the most productive and innovative nation in history. He inherited the largest economy in the world. And he inherited a people who have always risen to the occasion, regardless of the challenges they faced, so long as we have been led by men and women who have brought us together, called on our patriotism, and guided the nation with vision and conviction. 
"
1392,HOG,"Despite all that he inherited, President Obama did not repair our economy, he did not save Medicare and Social Security, he did not tame the spending and borrowing, he did not reach across the aisle to bring us together. Nor did he stand up to China's trade practices, or deliver on his promise to re-make our relations with the Muslim world, where anti-American extremism is on the rise. 
"
1393,HOG,"What he inherited wasn't the only problem; what he did with what he inherited made the problem worse.
"
1394,HOG,"In just four short years, he borrowed nearly $6 trillion, adding almost as much debt held by the public as all prior American presidents in history.
"
1395,HOG,"He forced through Obamacare, frightening small business from hiring new employees and adding thousands of dollars to every family's healthcare bill. 
"
1396,HOG,"He launched an onslaught of new regulations, often to the delight of the biggest banks and corporations, but to the detriment of the small, growing businesses that create two-thirds of our jobs. 
"
1397,HOG,"New business starts are at a 30-year low because entrepreneurs and investors are sitting on the sidelines, weary from the President’s staggering new regulations and proposed massive tax increases.
"
1398,HOG,"Many families can’t get mortgages and many entrepreneurs can’t get loans because of Dodd-Frank regulations that make it harder for banks to lend.
"
1399,HOG,"The president invested taxpayer money--your money--in green companies, now failed, that met his fancy, and sometimes were owned by his largest campaign contributors. He spent billions of taxpayer dollars on investments like Solyndra, Tesla, Fisker, and Ener1, which only added to our mounting federal debt.
"
1400,HOG,"Energy prices are up in part because energy production on federal lands is down.  He rejected the Keystone Pipeline from Canada, and cut in half drilling permits and leases, even as gasoline prices soared to new highs.
"
1401,HOG,"No, the problem with the Obama economy is not what he inherited; it is with the misguided policies that slowed the recovery, and caused millions of Americans to endure lengthy unemployment and poverty. That is why 15 million more of our fellow citizens are on food stamps than when President Obama was sworn into office. That is why 3 million more women are now living in poverty. That is why nearly 1 in 6 Americans today is poor.  That is why the economy is stagnant.
"
1402,HOG,"Today, we received the latest round of discouraging economic news:  Last quarter, our economy grew at just 2%.  After the stimulus was passed, the White House promised the economy would now be growing at 4.3%, over twice as fast.  Slow economic growth means slow job growth and declining take home pay. This is what four years of President Obama's policies have produced. Americans are ready for change--for growth, for jobs, for more take home pay.   
"
1403,HOG,"We have had four presidential and vice-presidential debates. And there is nothing in what the President proposed or defended that has any prospect of meeting the challenges of the times. Raising taxes will not grow jobs or ignite the economy--in fact, his tax plan has been calculated to destroy 700,000 jobs. A new stimulus, three years after the recession officially ended, may spare government, but it will not stimulate the private sector any better than did the stimulus of four years ago. And cutting one trillion dollars from the military will kill jobs and devastate our national defense. 
"
1404,HOG,"This is not the time to double down on the trickle-down government policies that have failed us; it is time for new bold changes that measure up to the moment, that can bring America's families the certainty that the future will be better than the past. 
"
1405,HOG,"If Paul Ryan and I are elected as your president and vice president, we will endeavor with all our hearts and energy to restore America. Instead of more spending, more borrowing from China and higher taxes from Washington, we’ll renew our faith in the power of free people pursuing their dreams.  We’ll start with our plan for a stronger middle class, which has five elements:
"
1406,HOG,"One, we will act to put America on track to a balanced budget by eliminating unnecessary programs, by sending programs back to states where they can be managed with less abuse and less cost, and by shrinking the bureaucracy of Washington. 
"
1407,HOG,"Two, we’ll produce more of the energy we need to heat our homes, fill our cars, and make our economy grow.  We will stop the Obama war on coal, the disdain for oil, and the effort to crimp natural gas by federal regulation of the very technology that produces it. We will support nuclear and renewables, but phase out subsidies once an industry is on its feet. And rather than investing in new electric auto and solar companies, we will invest in energy science and research to make discoveries that can actually change our energy world. And by 2020, we will achieve North American energy independence. 
"
1408,HOG,"Three, we will make trade work for America.  We’ll open more markets to American agriculture, products, and services. And we will finally hold accountable any nation that doesn't play by the rules.  I will stand up for the rights and interests of American workers and employers. 
"
1409,HOG,"Four, we will grow jobs by making America the best possible place for job creators, for entrepreneurs, for small business, for innovators, for manufacturers. This we will do by updating and reshaping regulations to encourage growth, by lowering tax rates while lowering deductions and closing loopholes, and by making it clear from day one that unlike the current administration, we actually like business and the jobs business creates. 
"
1410,HOG,"Finally, as we create more opportunity, we also will make sure that our citizens have the skills to succeed. Training programs will be shaped by the states where people live, and schools will put the interests of our kids, their parents, and their teachers above the interests of the teachers' unions.  
"
1411,HOG,"If we do those five things, our economy will come roaring back. We will create 12 million new jobs in just four years, raise take-home pay, and get the American economy growing at four percent a year—more than double this year's rate. After all the false promises of recovery and all the waiting, we will finally see help for America’s middle class.
"
1412,HOG,"Paul and I won’t stop there. When we take office, we will take responsibility to solve the big problems that everyone agrees can’t wait any longer.
"
1413,HOG,"We will save and secure Medicare and Social Security, both for current and near retirees, and for the generation to come. We will restore the $716 billion President Obama has taken from Medicare to pay for his vaunted Obamacare.
"
1414,HOG,"We will reform healthcare to tame the growth in its cost, to provide for those with pre-existing conditions, and to assure that every American has access to healthcare. We will replace government choice with consumer choice, bringing the dynamics of the marketplace to a sector of our lives that has long been dominated by government. 
"
1415,HOG,"These things among others we can only do if we work tirelessly to bridge the divide between the political parties. We will meet with Democrat and Republican leadership regularly, we will look for common ground and shared principles, and we will put the interests of the American people above the interests of the politicians. 
"
1416,HOG,"I know something about leading because I’ve led before.  In business, at the Olympics, and in Massachusetts, I’ve brought people together to achieve real change.
"
1417,HOG,"I was elected as a Republican governor in a state with a legislature that was 85% Democrat. We were looking at a multi-billion dollar budget gap. But instead of fighting with one another, we came together to solve our problems. We actually cut spending--reduced it. We lowered taxes 19 times. We defended school choice. And we worked to make our state business friendly.
"
1418,HOG,"Our state moved up 20 places in job growth. Our schools were ranked number one in the nation.  And we turned a $3 billion budget deficit into a $2 billion rainy day fund. 
"
1419,HOG,"I know it because I have seen it: Good Democrats can come together with good Republicans to solve big problems. What we need is leadership.
"
1420,HOG,"America is ready for that kind of leadership. Paul Ryan and I will provide it. Our plan for a stronger middle class will create jobs, stop the decline in take home pay, and put America back on the path of prosperity and opportunity. And this will enable us to fulfill our responsibility as the leader of the free world, to promote the principles of peace. We will help the Muslim world combat the spread of extremism; we will dissuade Iran from building a nuclear bomb; we will build enduring relationships throughout Latin America; and we will partner with China and other great nations to build a more stable and peaceful world. 
"
1421,HOG,"We face big challenges. But we also have big opportunities. New doors are open for us to sell our ideas and our products to the entire world. New technologies offer the promise of unbounded information and limitless innovation. New ideas are changing lives and hearts in diverse nations and among diverse peoples. If we seize the moment and rise to the occasion, the century ahead will be an American Century. 
"
1422,HOG,"Our children will graduate into jobs that are waiting for them. Our seniors will be confident that their retirement is secure. Our men and women will have good jobs and good pay and good benefits. And we will have every confidence that our lives are safe, and that our livelihoods are secure.
"
1423,HOG,"What this requires is change, change from the course of the last four years. It requires that we put aside the small and the petty, and demand the scale of change we deserve: we need real change, big change. 
"
1424,HOG,"Our campaign is about that kind of change--confronting the problems that politicians have avoided for over a decade, revitalizing our competitive economy, modernizing our education, restoring our founding principles. 
"
1425,HOG,"This is the kind of change that promises a better future, one shaped by men and women pursuing their dreams in their own unique ways.
"
1426,HOG,"This election is a choice between the status quo -- going forward with the same policies of the last four years -- or instead, choosing real change, change that offers promise, promise that the future will be better than the past. 
"
1427,HOG,"If you are ready for that kind of change, if you want this to be a turning point in America's course, join Paul Ryan and me, get your family and friends to join us, and vote now for the kind of leadership that these times demand. God bless you. And God bless America.     ####

It matters to your family.It matters to the senior who needs to get an appointment with a medical specialist but is told by one receptionist after another that the doctor isn't taking any new Medicare patients, because Medicare has been slashed to pay for Obamacare.It matters to the man from Waukesha, Wisconsin I spoke with several days ago.  In what were supposed to be his best work years, he used to have a job at $25 an hour with benefits and now has one at $8 an hour, without benefits. It matters to the college student, graduating this spring, with 10 to 20 thousand dollars in student debt, who now learns that she also will be paying for 50 thousand dollars in government debt, a burden that will put the American Dream beyond her reach.It matters for the child in a failing school, unable to go to the school of his parent's choosing, because the teacher's union that funds the President's campaign opposes school choice. The President's campaign has a slogan: it is ""forward."" But to the 23 million Americans struggling to find a good job, these last four years feel a lot more like ""backward."" We cannot afford four more years like the last four years.This election is about big things--like the education of our children, the value of our homes, the take home pay from our jobs, the price of the gasoline we buy, and the choices we have in our healthcare. It is also about the big things that determine these things--like the growth of the economy, the strength of our military, our dependence on foreign oil, and America's leadership in the world. President Obama frequently reminds us that he inherited a troubled economy. But a troubled economy is not all that President Obama inherited. He inherited the greatest nation in the history of the earth. He inherited the most productive and innovative nation in history. He inherited the largest economy in the world. And he inherited a people who have always risen to the occasion, regardless of the challenges they faced, so long as we have been led by men and women who have brought us together, called on our patriotism, and guided the nation with vision and conviction. Despite all that he inherited, President Obama did not repair our economy, he did not save Medicare and Social Security, he did not tame the spending and borrowing, he did not reach across the aisle to bring us together. Nor did he stand up to China's trade practices, or deliver on his promise to re-make our relations with the Muslim world, where anti-American extremism is on the rise. What he inherited wasn't the only problem; what he did with what he inherited made the problem worse.In just four short years, he borrowed nearly $6 trillion, adding almost as much debt held by the public as all prior American presidents in history.He forced through Obamacare, frightening small business from hiring new employees and adding thousands of dollars to every family's healthcare bill. He launched an onslaught of new regulations, often to the delight of the biggest banks and corporations, but to the detriment of the small, growing businesses that create two-thirds of our jobs. New business starts are at a 30-year low because entrepreneurs and investors are sitting on the sidelines, weary from the President’s staggering new regulations and proposed massive tax increases.Many families can’t get mortgages and many entrepreneurs can’t get loans because of Dodd-Frank regulations that make it harder for banks to lend.The president invested taxpayer money--your money--in green companies, now failed, that met his fancy, and sometimes were owned by his largest campaign contributors. He spent billions of taxpayer dollars on investments like Solyndra, Tesla, Fisker, and Ener1, which only added to our mounting federal debt.Energy prices are up in part because energy production on federal lands is down.  He rejected the Keystone Pipeline from Canada, and cut in half drilling permits and leases, even as gasoline prices soared to new highs.No, the problem with the Obama economy is not what he inherited; it is with the misguided policies that slowed the recovery, and caused millions of Americans to endure lengthy unemployment and poverty. That is why 15 million more of our fellow citizens are on food stamps than when President Obama was sworn into office. That is why 3 million more women are now living in poverty. That is why nearly 1 in 6 Americans today is poor.  That is why the economy is stagnant.Today, we received the latest round of discouraging economic news:  Last quarter, our economy grew at just 2%.  After the stimulus was passed, the White House promised the economy would now be growing at 4.3%, over twice as fast.  Slow economic growth means slow job growth and declining take home pay. This is what four years of President Obama's policies have produced. Americans are ready for change--for growth, for jobs, for more take home pay.   We have had four presidential and vice-presidential debates. And there is nothing in what the President proposed or defended that has any prospect of meeting the challenges of the times. Raising taxes will not grow jobs or ignite the economy--in fact, his tax plan has been calculated to destroy 700,000 jobs. A new stimulus, three years after the recession officially ended, may spare government, but it will not stimulate the private sector any better than did the stimulus of four years ago. And cutting one trillion dollars from the military will kill jobs and devastate our national defense. This is not the time to double down on the trickle-down government policies that have failed us; it is time for new bold changes that measure up to the moment, that can bring America's families the certainty that the future will be better than the past. If Paul Ryan and I are elected as your president and vice president, we will endeavor with all our hearts and energy to restore America. Instead of more spending, more borrowing from China and higher taxes from Washington, we’ll renew our faith in the power of free people pursuing their dreams.  We’ll start with our plan for a stronger middle class, which has five elements:One, we will act to put America on track to a balanced budget by eliminating unnecessary programs, by sending programs back to states where they can be managed with less abuse and less cost, and by shrinking the bureaucracy of Washington. Two, we’ll produce more of the energy we need to heat our homes, fill our cars, and make our economy grow.  We will stop the Obama war on coal, the disdain for oil, and the effort to crimp natural gas by federal regulation of the very technology that produces it. We will support nuclear and renewables, but phase out subsidies once an industry is on its feet. And rather than investing in new electric auto and solar companies, we will invest in energy science and research to make discoveries that can actually change our energy world. And by 2020, we will achieve North American energy independence. Three, we will make trade work for America.  We’ll open more markets to American agriculture, products, and services. And we will finally hold accountable any nation that doesn't play by the rules.  I will stand up for the rights and interests of American workers and employers. Four, we will grow jobs by making America the best possible place for job creators, for entrepreneurs, for small business, for innovators, for manufacturers. This we will do by updating and reshaping regulations to encourage growth, by lowering tax rates while lowering deductions and closing loopholes, and by making it clear from day one that unlike the current administration, we actually like business and the jobs business creates. Finally, as we create more opportunity, we also will make sure that our citizens have the skills to succeed. Training programs will be shaped by the states where people live, and schools will put the interests of our kids, their parents, and their teachers above the interests of the teachers' unions.  If we do those five things, our economy will come roaring back. We will create 12 million new jobs in just four years, raise take-home pay, and get the American economy growing at four percent a year—more than double this year's rate. After all the false promises of recovery and all the waiting, we will finally see help for America’s middle class.Paul and I won’t stop there. When we take office, we will take responsibility to solve the big problems that everyone agrees can’t wait any longer.We will save and secure Medicare and Social Security, both for current and near retirees, and for the generation to come. We will restore the $716 billion President Obama has taken from Medicare to pay for his vaunted Obamacare.We will reform healthcare to tame the growth in its cost, to provide for those with pre-existing conditions, and to assure that every American has access to healthcare. We will replace government choice with consumer choice, bringing the dynamics of the marketplace to a sector of our lives that has long been dominated by government. These things among others we can only do if we work tirelessly to bridge the divide between the political parties. We will meet with Democrat and Republican leadership regularly, we will look for common ground and shared principles, and we will put the interests of the American people above the interests of the politicians. I know something about leading because I’ve led before.  In business, at the Olympics, and in Massachusetts, I’ve brought people together to achieve real change.I was elected as a Republican governor in a state with a legislature that was 85% Democrat. We were looking at a multi-billion dollar budget gap. But instead of fighting with one another, we came together to solve our problems. We actually cut spending--reduced it. We lowered taxes 19 times. We defended school choice. And we worked to make our state business friendly.Our state moved up 20 places in job growth. Our schools were ranked number one in the nation.  And we turned a $3 billion budget deficit into a $2 billion rainy day fund. I know it because I have seen it: Good Democrats can come together with good Republicans to solve big problems. What we need is leadership.America is ready for that kind of leadership. Paul Ryan and I will provide it. Our plan for a stronger middle class will create jobs, stop the decline in take home pay, and put America back on the path of prosperity and opportunity. And this will enable us to fulfill our responsibility as the leader of the free world, to promote the principles of peace. We will help the Muslim world combat the spread of extremism; we will dissuade Iran from building a nuclear bomb; we will build enduring relationships throughout Latin America; and we will partner with China and other great nations to build a more stable and peaceful world. We face big challenges. But we also have big opportunities. New doors are open for us to sell our ideas and our products to the entire world. New technologies offer the promise of unbounded information and limitless innovation. New ideas are changing lives and hearts in diverse nations and among diverse peoples. If we seize the moment and rise to the occasion, the century ahead will be an American Century. Our children will graduate into jobs that are waiting for them. Our seniors will be confident that their retirement is secure. Our men and women will have good jobs and good pay and good benefits. And we will have every confidence that our lives are safe, and that our livelihoods are secure.What this requires is change, change from the course of the last four years. It requires that we put aside the small and the petty, and demand the scale of change we deserve: we need real change, big change. Our campaign is about that kind of change--confronting the problems that politicians have avoided for over a decade, revitalizing our competitive economy, modernizing our education, restoring our founding principles. This is the kind of change that promises a better future, one shaped by men and women pursuing their dreams in their own unique ways.This election is a choice between the status quo -- going forward with the same policies of the last four years -- or instead, choosing real change, change that offers promise, promise that the future will be better than the past. If you are ready for that kind of change, if you want this to be a turning point in America's course, join Paul Ryan and me, get your family and friends to join us, and vote now for the kind of leadership that these times demand. God bless you. And God bless America.     ####Click on the box just below to hear the new weekly IBD politics podcast.

1429,HOG,"We have heard many times from President Obama how he plans to raise taxes on ""millionaires and billionaires,"" but not on the middle class. Apparently, if you don't happen to be a millionaire or billionaire, you don't have to worry. But the numbers say otherwise — and say so big time. The actual tax increase plans being proposed by Obama…

1430,HOG,"Obesity: Don't blame the on-campus sale of snacks for making kids fat. So says a study of 19,000 middle-schoolers. Shouldn't it be clear by now that good health starts at home?It's time to chill out about the Cheetos, if these or similar guilty pleasures are being sold at your kids school. It's not that they're nutritious. It's just that they're not the dangerous fat bombs that many dietary activists have made them out to be.And another thing: Don't expect school to teach your children how to eat. That's up to you, Mom and Dad.A newly published study by researchers at Penn State, using data on 19,450 children from fifth to eighth grade, found no link between weight gain and the availability of so-called ""competitive foods.""That label covers food such as soft drinks, candy bars and chips sold in vending machines or snack bars and not required to meet federal nutrition guidelines for school meals — in short, junk food. Most middle schools covered in the study sell it, often to raise money for athletics and other student activities.It's also a fat target for those who blame the food industry — rather than the choices people make with regard to diet and exercise — for the nation's obesity epidemic.The campaign against such junk food has had some success. In 2005, for instance, the American Beverage Association agreed to stop selling sugar-sweetened soda in public schools, and in 2010 it proudly reported ""an 88% percent decrease in total beverage calories shipped to schools"" over the prior five years.The Penn State study doesn't sing the praises of junk food. But it does express some doubt about the value of actions such as the beverage industry's ban on sugared sodas: ""It remains unclear whether this focus on schools will reduce the prevalence of child obesity.""So it seems that a lot of energy is being wasted in pointless fights over school food. And school boards that go whole hog with health-conscious menus may actually be making the problem of unhealthy eating worse.If children won't touch the strange quinoa concoction whipped up for them at lunch, they'll come home extra hungry and hit the potato chips.If all they can get at home is a healthful bowl of fruit, of course, they're stuck with that. And that's the real message of the Penn State study. What happens outside school hours — and in the years before children even start kindergarten — is far more important to health than the content of meals or snacks at school.

1487,HOG,"President Barack Obama and Wall Street occupiers, along with their allies in the mainstream media and on college campuses, have maintained an ongoing attack on high-income earners, people they call 1 percenters.Listening to their deceitful demagoguery, you would naturally think of them as 99 percenters, but you'd be dead-wrong.Last week, MSN Money posted a report titled ""The richest counties in America."" According to the report, residents of those 15 wealthiest counties ""have median household incomes that are double the national average.""Three of those counties have a median income of more than $100,000. The report goes on to say, ""While many Americans struggle to find jobs, balance their budgets and get by with less, some folks are living high on the hog."" Let's look at some of those counties.Loudoun County, Va., has a median household income of $119,540, making it the nation's richest county. Virginia's Fairfax County is next, with a median household income of $103,010; the median price of a house is $507,800. Third is Howard County, Md., where the median household income is $101,771. These three richest counties have seven nearby high-income neighbors, which include Arlington and Montgomery counties. The nation's richest counties are close to Washington, D.C., where people come to do good and wind up doing well for themselves.These 1 percenters are not wealthy right-wing Republicans; they are Obama's liberals. How can one tell? It turns out that seven of the 10 wealthiest counties in the Washington area voted overwhelmingly for Obama in 2008. These liberals portray themselves as 99 percenters when they are really 1 percenters. They're simply running a deceitful rope-a-dope, aided by the mainstream media, on the American people.During last year's Occupy movement, truly seedy-looking characters camped out on the streets and in the parks of several of our cities, causing millions of dollars of property damage. They committed robberies, thefts and sex crimes. Some of their lowlife acts, such as defecating and urinating in public and on police vehicles, were filmed. These people also portrayed themselves as 99 percenters. It turns out that they weren't that at all.Will Rahn, deputy editor for The Daily Caller, wrote an article titled ""NYC arrest records: Many Occupy Wall Street protesters live in luxury"" (Nov. 2, 2011). Nearly 1,000 protesters were arrested in New York between Sept. 18 and Oct. 15. Police collected information on each arrestee's name, age, sex, criminal charge, home address and — in most cases — race. The median value of the homes of the arrestees was $305,000 — a far higher number than the $185,400 median value of owner-occupied homes of the rest of us. Ninety-five of the arrestees lived in homes valued at more than $500,000. Those who rented paid a median rent of $1,850 per month.Of the 984 protesters arrested, at least 797 are white. One Occupy Wall Street protester arrested — presumably, if you listen to the mainstream media, penniless and from a blue-collar family — lived in an $850,000 home in the nation's capital.Recall that while on the campaign trail, Obama promised, ""We will stand up in this election to bring about the change that won't just win an election but will transform America.""Along with progressives, who formerly called themselves liberals, Obama wants to transform America into a European-like socialist nation. The Occupy protesters and their useful idiots in the media and on college campuses proudly display signs and banners revealing their preferences and affiliations, such as ""Communist Party USA,"" ""Democratic Socialists of America"" and ""Fight for Socialism."" The American Nazi Party has issued an official endorsement of Occupy.The movement is also supported by White House leftist allies such as the Working Families Party, the Service Employees International Union — as well as most other labor unions — ACORN, the New Party and the Democratic National Committee.During the forthcoming elections, we can be assured that these people will do all they can, including violent protests, to help Obama have an additional four years to continue his transformation of our nation.

1490,HOG,"With about 45 minutes to go, the NASDAQ 100 (QQQ) has gone from a session-long position of relative strength to a slightly weaker situation which has the tech-heavy index narrowly cutting through its first hour lows. The good news for bulls open to bargain-hunting is daily chart support has remained intact to establish a double bottom, while flushing out the S&P 500's similar but possibly begging to be hit pattern as it lined up with the closely watched 1100 level. 
"
1491,HOG,"The CBOE Volatility Index or VIX is a bit of wildcard for this strategist as it relates to fast operating bulls wishing to see Tuesday's lows as a technical line in the sand i.e. stop loss, for any bargain-hunting endeavors. For one, today's highs near 47% still managed to miss the August panic highs of 48%. Secondly and due to the elevated readings in the VIX of recent weeks, the gauge also narrowly missed stretching to a short-term extreme of 15% or more above its 10-day simple moving average with a result of roughly 13.50%.

1492,HOG,"Is this a case of the price action being good enough for bargain-hunters and who might appreciate that perfection isn't necessarily all that it's cracked up to be when it comes to the market? Given the historically elevated readings in the VIX and near 9% drop in the broader market for the five day period, we certainly can't blame faster money types for trying to play, particularly so if they make good use of a limited risk spread strategy and keep to the fore-mentioned mercy point.

1493,HOG,"For bears that've cared of late, we're a bit more confident and pragmatic Tuesday's price action is very much ""good enough"" for adjusting or exiting any short deltas which may have provided some decent coin during the market's downturn.

1495,HOG,"Apple (AAPL) fans lined up outside retail stores Friday to get their hands on the company's third-generation iPad tablet computer.
"
1496,HOG,"By at least one analyst's count, lines were far shorter this time.
"
1497,HOG,"And many shoppers were upgrading to the new device from Apple's original iPad, having skipped the intermediate iPad 2 release last year.
"
1498,HOG,"""I'm upgrading,"" said Tanja Brandt of Potomac Falls, Va. ""I sold my first iPad so I could get this one.""
"
1499,HOG,"Brandt was one of about 200 people lined up outside the Apple store in Reston, Va., early Friday.
"
1500,HOG,"She was getting the pricier model iPad with high-speed 4G LTE wireless connectivity so she can connect to the Internet anywhere.
"
1501,HOG,"""My iPad will go wherever I go,"" she said. ""I have all my addresses, contacts, calendar, email, games, books, music and movies on it.""
"
1502,HOG,"Her son Connor, 18, also was getting a new iPad on Friday. For him, it was a choice between getting a used car or a shiny, new iPad.
"
1503,HOG,"Fordham University student Robby Abiera, 23, drove about five hours from New York City to Reston with some friends and waited in line four hours to get the new iPad. That was preferable to waiting a couple of days in line at an Apple store in New York, he said.
"
1504,HOG,"Abiera had the original iPad, which was for personal use and schoolwork.
"
1505,HOG,"Supplies of the new iPad, which many are calling the iPad 3, are expected to be tight for several weeks. Apple's website says orders for the new iPad will ship in two to three weeks.

"
1507,HOG,"Apple likely will sell 2 million to 3 million new model iPads in the next two weeks, Wu says. He expects Apple to sell 10 million total iPads this quarter.
"
1508,HOG,"The iPad 2 launched on March 11, 2011. Apple later said it sold 4.7 million iPads in the quarter ended March 26, 2011, but that it could have sold more except for supply constraints. That might again be the case.
"
1509,HOG,"Lower-priced iPad 2 tablets will help boost sales near term, Wu point outs. ""The iPad 2 is actually selling pretty well,"" he said.
"
1510,HOG,"Apple's older iPad 2 tablets are available for $100 less than before, starting at $399.
"
1511,HOG,"Meanwhile, the new iPad is priced starting at $499 for a Wi-Fi only model with 16 gigabytes of storage.

1512,HOG,"Apple still largely has the tablet market to itself, says ISI Group analyst Brian Marshall. ""From a competitive perspective, it's pretty smooth sailing for Apple,"" he said.
"
1513,HOG,"In full-featured tablets, Apple's biggest competitor is Samsung's Galaxy Tab, which runs Google's (GOOG) Android operating system. Amazon.com (AMZN) also competes with the iPad, but its offering — the Kindle Fire — is a stripped-down, small-screen Android tablet. The Kindle Fire has a 7-inch display and sells for $199.

1514,HOG,"Marshall predicts that iPads will account for 60 million of the 90 million tablets sold this year.
"
1515,HOG,"Yet the newness of the iPad seems to have worn off. Hudson Square analyst Daniel Ernst reported Friday that lines for the new tablet were more than 75% shorter than the crowds that gathered for the launch of the iPad 2 a year ago. His observation was based on lines outside five retail locations in Connecticut and New York.
"
1516,HOG,"""All but three of the people we spoke with already owned an iPad,"" Ernst wrote in a research note. ""During our iPad 2 survey last year we found 69% of our 80 respondents did not already have the iPad 1.""

"
1524,HOG,"Seeing how there looks to be technical arguments for both bears and bulls in Apple's stock and since earnings (and a potential catalyst) aren't until April 20, the idea of a short iron condor comes to mind as a way to capture profits as a more neutral minded option hedge hog.
"
1525,HOG,"Looking at the options board, with the April contract expiring a week prior to the event and also highly sensitive to time decay with just 15 calendar days left in its life; traders might be conclude April is the best month with which to focus for this type of non-directional income strategy. However, there may actually be a stronger, albeit less profitable choice to consider. 
"
1526,HOG,"The problem with collecting on an April iron condor is its decay has large and growing levels of attached negative gamma.

1533,HOG,"IBD 50 constituent Herbalife (HLF) saw its shares gobbled up on massive volume Wednesday. The price performance is highlighted by a six-plus month breakout to all-time highs from a slightly flawed high level corrective double bottom base and follows the nutritional supplement provider's overall better-than-expected fourth quarter earnings report. 
"
1534,HOG,"The gain of 6.88% to 66.78 also looks technically promising as the action gapped slightly above the proper buy point of 63.50, held above those levels with a low of 64 and then went on to thrust higher and close near session highs. For stock bulls not already in HLF, Wednesday's finish puts shares 5% above the ideal buy point and at the cusp of being riskier to purchase. However, the use of a bullish vertical might be viewed as one way for would-be bulls to position with a bit more authority. 
"
1535,HOG,"Sporting fairly decent liquidity of 1,400 contracts daily and still enjoying 2.5 point strikes in surrounding money markets which are quoted $0.05 to $0.15 wide, bulls have a range of options, pardon the pun, to choose from with the vertical strategy. For those seeking more secure but lesser gains, an out-of-the-money bull put vertical or in-the-money call vertical might be considered. 
"
1536,HOG,"For instance, for a credit of $0.70 or a debit of $1.80, a trader could establish the 62.5 / 65 bull vertical with the former using the puts and the latter the calls. Above 65, $0.70 profit would be the result at expiration for a gain of about 40% in 23 calendar days. As the spread relates to current prices, the positioning allows this limited risk / limited reward bulls some breathing room to the downside. At the end of the day or more correctly, at the end of 23 calendar days, shares could be nearly 3% lower, but above 65, the position would still realize its maximum profit. 
"
1537,HOG,"As for a couple of the inherent risks, at the ideal buy point of 63.50, the spread would result in a loss of $0.80 and if shares were to pull in less than 2% below that level and below the lower strike of the vertical; the spread would see its maximum loss of $1.80. As a move of this magnitude would also represent a 7% stop loss for a bull confident in purchasing shares at Wednesday's closing levels; traders might further weigh proper position sizing for this type spread versus assumed risk using outright long stock.

As for a couple of the inherent risks, at the ideal buy point of 63.50, the spread would result in a loss of $0.80 and if shares were to pull in less than 2% below that level and below the lower strike of the vertical; the spread would see its maximum loss of $1.80. As a move of this magnitude would also represent a 7% stop loss for a bull confident in purchasing shares at Wednesday's closing levels; traders might further weigh proper position sizing for this type spread versus assumed risk using outright long stock.What do you think?

1540,HOG,"There's no bigger mockery from the term ""public servant"" than the outsized taxpayer-paid pensions that go to those who spend a lifetime abusing us at the tax office, saddling us with looney environmental regulations, losing our permit paperwork, working with casual sloth, shoveling taxpayer goodies to illegal aliens, and drawing full pay for years even after molesting schoolchildren.

1558,HOG,"With an hour left in Friday's session, the market is well on its way to establishing an attempted rally day. For the bulls yearning for better days ahead, leadership can be found in the broad-based S&P 500, which is currently up 0.90%.

1571,HOG,"IBD Special Report: Mutual Fund Monthly
"
1572,HOG,"The more the broad market favors secular growth stories over cyclicals, the better that JPMorgan Mid Cap Growth Fund does.
"
1573,HOG,"The $1.6 billion fund's relative outperformance this year tops its relative showing over the past 12 months. In turn, its relative performance over the past year beat how it did over the past three years.
"
1574,HOG,"Going into Wednesday, the fund was up 17.62% so far this year. Its midcap growth rivals tracked by Morningstar Inc. averaged a 14.43% gain. The S&P 500 was up 12.51%.
"
1575,HOG,"That put the fund in the top 13% of its peer group. It was in the top 41% over the past year and the top 46% over the past 36 months.
"
1576,HOG,"From his Manhattan office, lead manager Timothy Parton, 46 years old, talked with IBD about his investment approach.
"
1577,HOG,"IBD: Your investment recipe has two key ingredients. Lower-risk core names are your meat and potatoes. And you spice things up with small amounts of riskier, higher-growth names. What are some examples, please?
"
1578,HOG,"Parton: Our biggest names by their nature have lower risk. It can be because we've know them a long time. Or the nature of their business involves a recurring revenue model.
"
1579,HOG,"Our biggest overweight is a filtration company called Pall (PLL). This is a little different story for growth managers. It is like a razor and razor blades business. It sells the main setup. Then it sells replacement filter cartridges over and over again. It's a classic recurring revenue type of business.
"
1580,HOG,"We anchor our portfolio with names like that or W.W. Grainger (GWW). Grainger has little end-of-the-quarter risk. It's an MRO (maintenance-repair-operations) business. Revenues are very visible, very steady. It has a little cyclicality, but it's mild.
"
1581,HOG,"Those types of stocks are our biggest positions. Our growthiest names tend to be smaller positions.
"
1582,HOG,"IBD: Technology was your largest sector as of March 31 with a 25% weighting. So are most of your tech names smaller positions?
"
1583,HOG,"Parton: We're significantly overweight in tech. But most individual holdings are small. Given the nature of risk of those names, we'd rather diversify.
"
1584,HOG,"IBD: Tell me about some interesting names, like Rackspace Hosting (RAX). Earnings per share grew 56% and 80% the past two quarters.
"
1585,HOG,"Parton: Yes, this would be in that category of small positions. We owned it in our small-cap growth fund. Our tech analyst has known them since their IPO (in August 2008).
"
1586,HOG,"Rackspace enables cloud implementations. Their most obvious direct competitor is Amazon Web Services, a division of Amazon. You need an IT department to use Amazon because they won't help you. But Rackspace employs tons of engineers and helps smaller companies so they don't need their IT department.
"
1587,HOG,"The constriction on their growth is how quickly they can hire engineers to implement systems for clients.
"
1588,HOG,"Rackspace is a higher risk, higher valuation name, so we keep the position relatively small.
"
1589,HOG,"IBD: What characterizes high-growth names?
"
1590,HOG,"Parton: They grow irrespective of the economy. They're one end of our portfolio.
"
1591,HOG,"IBD: How do they differ from stocks at the opposite end?
"
1592,HOG,"Parton: The other end can be great franchises, but ones more tied to the unfolding economic recovery. They're not deeply cyclical. But they can be sensitive to the cycle.
"
1593,HOG,"IBD: What are some examples, please?
"
1594,HOG,"Parton: Harley-Davidson (HOG) is finally seeing real strength among their dealers. Harley's shipments are still way down from their 2006 peak. They're barely off the bottom. But through all the difficulties, the company has gained market share. It has new management, which has done restructuring. It's quite exciting.
"
1595,HOG,"IBD: I see the stock got below 10 in 2009. It's in the low 50s now. And return on equity nearly doubled last year. What's another example?
"
1596,HOG,"Parton: Sherwin-Williams (SHW).
"
1597,HOG,"IBD: It's up about 70% off its September low. Earnings per share growth has accelerated for two quarters. But some technical indicators are still soft. What's the appeal for a growth manager?
"
1598,HOG,"Parton: It's not exactly what you'd associate with growth managers. But you can see how well the stock has done. Their business, the paint business, is just starting to come back. It came down a lot from its 2006 peak.
"
1599,HOG,"IBD: Lululemon Athletica (LULU) is a name that growth managers like. They're expanding on several fronts beyond yoga clothes for women. What's your thesis here?
"
1600,HOG,"Parton: We really like them. It's harder to find true growth stories in the midcap space. A lot of their growth is earlier in their trajectory (while they are small caps).
"
1601,HOG,"By the time they are midcaps, many retail chains are mature. But Lulu is younger and has higher growth. We owned it in our small-cap growth fund. They had one or two stumbles early on. They brought in stronger management. Christine Day, the CEO, was from Starbucks (SBUX). She's strengthened their platform and growth strategy.
"
1602,HOG,"They're still not well-known in the U.S. They've got a massive store buildout (in front of them). And they've got room to grow on the Web. And they have room for lots of growth outside North America.
"
1603,HOG,"They can charge a premium for their products. They make good money out of it. They can keep growing at well-above-average rates for years.
"
1604,HOG,"IBD: What's driving TransDigm Group (TDG)?
"
1605,HOG,"Parton: The aerospace market did not get that weak even in the recession. That was largely because of orders from China and the rest of Asia. In the U.S., air fleets are very old, so a lot of airlines will have to replace parts.
"
1606,HOG,"We can see the cycle going on for a while. We used to own Goodrich (GR). Now TransDigm is our main exposure to aerospace.
"
1607,HOG,"It's not a huge position because the valuation is not cheap. But their financials and margins and return on capital — it's shocking to see how strong they are.
"
1608,HOG,"They are acquisitive. They buy companies which sell to the aftermarket vs. the original equipment market. There tend to be only one or two providers. So that's highly profitable.
"
1609,HOG,"They sell things to airlines that need replacement at certain intervals. That gives them visibility.
"
1610,HOG,"They keep finding acquisitions. They just bought the biggest seat belt company. Very financially disciplined.
"
1611,HOG,"IBD: What's your thesis for Michael Kors (KORS), which has almost doubled since its recent IPO?
"
1612,HOG,"Parton: They are growing gangbusters. They're in the same category as Lululemon. They also have a lot of ""white space"" (room for growth). They're skewed toward accessories, watches, footwear.
"
1613,HOG,"They're about 50-50 wholesale-retail. But they're rolling out more stores. And they plan to expand more into Europe and Asia.
"
1614,HOG,"They're putting out unusually high comp-store sales numbers.
"
1615,HOG,"Our analyst is excited. But we don't have a huge position because of the inherent risk around expectations and valuations.
"
1616,HOG,"IBD: Can Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) keep coming up with new orphan drugs?
"
1617,HOG,"Parton: Their drugs treat orphan conditions — disorders that attack small parts of the population. Soliris is the one many people know. Alexion has done this perfectly. They've also found new applications.
"
1618,HOG,"With many orphan drugs, you can charge a lot for them. They tend to get rapid approval if efficacy is strong. And they're expanding into new markets, like Japan, with new (applications) from the original one.
"
1619,HOG,"IBD: VeriFone Systems (PAY) is being driven by several things, including a replacement cycle based on security upgrades. What do you like?
"
1620,HOG,"Parton: There are several drivers. Mobile payments: In European restaurants, you pay on a mobile device at your table; in the U.S., gas station video terminals; wireless payments via smartphones; using credit cards in taxis; and, yes, new security standards.
"
1621,HOG,"In Europe, credit cards have imbedded chips and PINs. Now merchants in the U.S. are moving to more secure cards.
"
1622,HOG,"IBD: J.B. Hunt (JBHT) has three quarters of accelerating EPS growth. Is this a play on GDP growth?
"
1623,HOG,"Parton: Back in Mr. Hunt's day, this was a plain vanilla trucking company.
"
1624,HOG,"They've figured out which parts of the business are low-return pure commodities, and they've focused instead on the more unique parts. Those are the intermodal parts. They replace long-haul trucking by moving ocean containers on special railcars, then trucks, which cuts costs. They were an early mover in that space.
"
1625,HOG,"They also do dedicated fleets for certain customers like Wal-Mart (WMT).
"
1626,HOG,"IBD: What's your view of Alliance Data (ADS), which has trended higher since July 2010?
"
1627,HOG,"Parton: They were going to be acquired in a deal that fell apart in the financial crisis, which led to a big reset for the stock. They've delivered well since then.
"
1628,HOG,"They're in a couple of businesses. They're in loyalty programs for retailers and companies like (Visa (V) and Best Buy (BBY). They manage the actual credit card program for Limited Brands (LTD) .
"
1629,HOG,"And they run a marketing business for all kinds of businesses.
"
1630,HOG,"It's a low expectations stock, with a lot of naysayers. But they've really delivered and the stock has done well. It's still modestly valued.
"
1631,HOG,"IBD: Ulta Beauty (ULTA) is the beauty supply chain people talk about. But Sally Beauty (SBH) is also doing well. Why?
"
1632,HOG,"Parton: Sally was part of Alberto Culver. It was their crown jewel. It was quietly split out.
"
1633,HOG,"You don't see Sally's stores in 'A' locations. One of their concepts is to sell to hair-care professionals who work in salons. They work for themselves and rent a chair or booth in someone else's salon.
"
1634,HOG,"Their other concept is to sell directly to consumers.
"
1635,HOG,"Sally's stores are growing both organically and through acquisitions. It's not high growth. But it's steady.
"
1636,HOG,"Demographics are one driver. As the population ages, more women want to color their hair. So spending on hair care is increasing.
"
1637,HOG,"Overall, Sally is a great business with great cash flow, great margins, good drivers and it's off most people's radar screens.
"
1638,HOG,"IBD: How does this midcap growth fund differ from its peers?
"
1639,HOG,"Parton: I, Chris Jones — who heads our team — and other managers in our group have been doing this for 20 to 30 years each. That's a lot of experience.
"
1640,HOG,"We're a preferred investor, which gives us great access to company meetings.
"
1641,HOG,"In terms of style, I can't tell you we are uniquely different. But we have refined our process over the years. Every step, from idea generation to screening to due diligence to portfolio construction to risk management. And I have learned from mistakes.
"
1642,HOG,"The 1990s bull market lulled a lot of investors into a false sense of security. They tended to fall in love with companies. They would lose perspective. They weren't able to tell when a company's fundamentals were changing.
"
1643,HOG,"The aftermath of the tech bubble taught me to be less close to companies, more dispassionate, tighten my sell discipline, which is critical for a growth manager.
"
1644,HOG,"There's little reason to nurse a stock that is not performing. I would rather amputate, cauterize the wound, and say we can come back to this name again later.

It's a classic recurring revenue type of business.We anchor our portfolio with names like that or W.W. Grainger (GWW). Grainger has little end-of-the-quarter risk. It's an MRO (maintenance-repair-operations) business. Revenues are very visible, very steady. It has a little cyclicality, but it's mild.Those types of stocks are our biggest positions. Our growthiest names tend to be smaller positions.IBD: Technology was your largest sector as of March 31 with a 25% weighting. So are most of your tech names smaller positions?Parton: We're significantly overweight in tech. But most individual holdings are small. Given the nature of risk of those names, we'd rather diversify.IBD: Tell me about some interesting names, like Rackspace Hosting (RAX). Earnings per share grew 56% and 80% the past two quarters.Parton: Yes, this would be in that category of small positions. We owned it in our small-cap growth fund. Our tech analyst has known them since their IPO (in August 2008).Rackspace enables cloud implementations. Their most obvious direct competitor is Amazon Web Services, a division of Amazon. You need an IT department to use Amazon because they won't help you. But Rackspace employs tons of engineers and helps smaller companies so they don't need their IT department.The constriction on their growth is how quickly they can hire engineers to implement systems for clients.Rackspace is a higher risk, higher valuation name, so we keep the position relatively small.IBD: What characterizes high-growth names?Parton: They grow irrespective of the economy. They're one end of our portfolio.IBD: How do they differ from stocks at the opposite end?Parton: The other end can be great franchises, but ones more tied to the unfolding economic recovery. They're not deeply cyclical. But they can be sensitive to the cycle.IBD: What are some examples, please?Parton: Harley-Davidson (HOG) is finally seeing real strength among their dealers. Harley's shipments are still way down from their 2006 peak. They're barely off the bottom. But through all the difficulties, the company has gained market share. It has new management, which has done restructuring. It's quite exciting.IBD: I see the stock got below 10 in 2009. It's in the low 50s now. And return on equity nearly doubled last year. What's another example?Parton: Sherwin-Williams (SHW).IBD: It's up about 70% off its September low. Earnings per share growth has accelerated for two quarters. But some technical indicators are still soft. What's the appeal for a growth manager?Parton: It's not exactly what you'd associate with growth managers. But you can see how well the stock has done. Their business, the paint business, is just starting to come back. It came down a lot from its 2006 peak.IBD: Lululemon Athletica (LULU) is a name that growth managers like. They're expanding on several fronts beyond yoga clothes for women. What's your thesis here?Parton: We really like them. It's harder to find true growth stories in the midcap space. A lot of their growth is earlier in their trajectory (while they are small caps).By the time they are midcaps, many retail chains are mature. But Lulu is younger and has higher growth. We owned it in our small-cap growth fund. They had one or two stumbles early on. They brought in stronger management. Christine Day, the CEO, was from Starbucks (SBUX). She's strengthened their platform and growth strategy.They're still not well-known in the U.S. They've got a massive store buildout (in front of them). And they've got room to grow on the Web. And they have room for lots of growth outside North America.They can charge a premium for their products. They make good money out of it. They can keep growing at well-above-average rates for years.IBD: What's driving TransDigm Group (TDG)?Parton: The aerospace market did not get that weak even in the recession. That was largely because of orders from China and the rest of Asia. In the U.S., air fleets are very old, so a lot of airlines will have to replace parts.We can see the cycle going on for a while. We used to own Goodrich (GR). Now TransDigm is our main exposure to aerospace.It's not a huge position because the valuation is not cheap. But their financials and margins and return on capital — it's shocking to see how strong they are.They are acquisitive. They buy companies which sell to the aftermarket vs. the original equipment market. There tend to be only one or two providers. So that's highly profitable.They sell things to airlines that need replacement at certain intervals. That gives them visibility.They keep finding acquisitions. They just bought the biggest seat belt company. Very financially disciplined.IBD: What's your thesis for Michael Kors (KORS), which has almost doubled since its recent IPO?Parton: They are growing gangbusters. They're in the same category as Lululemon. They also have a lot of ""white space"" (room for growth). They're skewed toward accessories, watches, footwear.They're about 50-50 wholesale-retail. But they're rolling out more stores. And they plan to expand more into Europe and Asia.They're putting out unusually high comp-store sales numbers.Our analyst is excited. But we don't have a huge position because of the inherent risk around expectations and valuations.IBD: Can Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) keep coming up with new orphan drugs?Parton: Their drugs treat orphan conditions — disorders that attack small parts of the population. Soliris is the one many people know. Alexion has done this perfectly. They've also found new applications.With many orphan drugs, you can charge a lot for them. They tend to get rapid approval if efficacy is strong. And they're expanding into new markets, like Japan, with new (applications) from the original one.IBD: VeriFone Systems (PAY) is being driven by several things, including a replacement cycle based on security upgrades. What do you like?Parton: There are several drivers. Mobile payments: In European restaurants, you pay on a mobile device at your table; in the U.S., gas station video terminals; wireless payments via smartphones; using credit cards in taxis; and, yes, new security standards.In Europe, credit cards have imbedded chips and PINs. Now merchants in the U.S. are moving to more secure cards.IBD: J.B. Hunt (JBHT) has three quarters of accelerating EPS growth. Is this a play on GDP growth?Parton: Back in Mr. Hunt's day, this was a plain vanilla trucking company.They've figured out which parts of the business are low-return pure commodities, and they've focused instead on the more unique parts. Those are the intermodal parts. They replace long-haul trucking by moving ocean containers on special railcars, then trucks, which cuts costs. They were an early mover in that space.They also do dedicated fleets for certain customers like Wal-Mart (WMT).IBD: What's your view of Alliance Data (ADS), which has trended higher since July 2010?Parton: They were going to be acquired in a deal that fell apart in the financial crisis, which led to a big reset for the stock. They've delivered well since then.They're in a couple of businesses. They're in loyalty programs for retailers and companies like (Visa (V) and Best Buy (BBY). They manage the actual credit card program for Limited Brands (LTD) .And they run a marketing business for all kinds of businesses.It's a low expectations stock, with a lot of naysayers. But they've really delivered and the stock has done well. It's still modestly valued.IBD: Ulta Beauty (ULTA) is the beauty supply chain people talk about. But Sally Beauty (SBH) is also doing well. Why?Parton: Sally was part of Alberto Culver. It was their crown jewel. It was quietly split out.You don't see Sally's stores in 'A' locations. One of their concepts is to sell to hair-care professionals who work in salons. They work for themselves and rent a chair or booth in someone else's salon.Their other concept is to sell directly to consumers.Sally's stores are growing both organically and through acquisitions. It's not high growth. But it's steady.Demographics are one driver. As the population ages, more women want to color their hair. So spending on hair care is increasing.Overall, Sally is a great business with great cash flow, great margins, good drivers and it's off most people's radar screens.IBD: How does this midcap growth fund differ from its peers?Parton: I, Chris Jones — who heads our team — and other managers in our group have been doing this for 20 to 30 years each. That's a lot of experience.We're a preferred investor, which gives us great access to company meetings.In terms of style, I can't tell you we are uniquely different. But we have refined our process over the years. Every step, from idea generation to screening to due diligence to portfolio construction to risk management. And I have learned from mistakes.The 1990s bull market lulled a lot of investors into a false sense of security. They tended to fall in love with companies. They would lose perspective. They weren't able to tell when a company's fundamentals were changing.The aftermath of the tech bubble taught me to be less close to companies, more dispassionate, tighten my sell discipline, which is critical for a growth manager.There's little reason to nurse a stock that is not performing. I would rather amputate, cauterize the wound, and say we can come back to this name again later. Let's not waste time on it now. Let's focus on things that are working.

1646,HOG,"Qualcomm (QCOM) is the No. 1 maker of chip sets used in cellphones and is also making a big push to get its chips into other mobile devices.
"
1647,HOG,"The San Diego-based company saw sales jump 36% for its fiscal year ended Sept. 25, helped by its Snapdragon line of chips. First shipped in 2008, the chips are used in many smartphones and other mobile devices. The company says Snapdragon shipments rose fourfold in fiscal 2011.
"
1648,HOG,"More than 300 devices running Snapdragon have been announced, with another 350 in development, the company says.
"
1649,HOG,"Qualcomm is also pushing into displays with its technology called Mirasol.
"
1650,HOG,"William Davidson, senior vice president of global marketing, recently spoke with IBD about the company.
"
1651,HOG,"IBD: Why has Snapdragon been a success?
"
1652,HOG,"Davidson: No one else has assembled this fully integrated complete solution (for all the functions needed in a mobile device). We have the modem, graphics processor, GPS, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, multimode capabilities and more. There is no one else that has assembled all those assets into one chip, with the software that ties it altogether.
"
1653,HOG,"That's been our strategy going back six or seven years, when we started putting functionality on the chip sets beyond just being able to make calls and send text. That integration solves complexity for our customers, instead of having to buy the application processors from one company, the modem from another, and GPS and Bluetooth (from others). We provide the complete solution that enables much faster time to market for our partners and at a lower cost.
"
1654,HOG,"IBD: Qualcomm wants to sell Snapdragon to markets beyond just phones. How is that going?
"
1655,HOG,"Davidson: If you look at (unit sales of chips in mobile devices besides phones) from 2010 to 2015, analysts estimate a compound annual growth rate of 40%. So it's clearly a good opportunity. If you look at recent earnings by Vodafone (VOD) and its machine-to-machine applications, they see (strong) volume growth in the automotive segment, security, metering and other segments (which provide such things as in-car or in-building wireless monitoring and tracking). We are well-positioned here with Snapdragon. It's a wonderful opportunity for us to license to makers of new devices coming to market, as well as (licensing chips to makers of products in) key verticals like health care and smart grid.
"
1656,HOG,"IBD: How do you define the machine-to-machine category?
"
1657,HOG,"Davidson: Many think of M2M in areas such as a remote meter reading. We see M2M more broadly, such as the connected home. Five years ago, I had one IP address for my (one PC connected to the Internet). Now I have many IP addresses, with extra computers and cameras. I could have a lot more if we're successful in getting wireless embedded into every piece of consumer electronic equipment we can think of.
"
1658,HOG,"IBD: Is what you're describing called the ""Internet of Things""?
"
1659,HOG,"Davidson: Some call it the Internet of things. We call it the Internet of everything. We believe that every single computing device or consumer electronics device will work better if it's connected to a network that provides real-time connectivity that makes devices smarter. Your phone will be the center of it.
"
1660,HOG,"IBD: What's your view about the opportunity of getting tablet makers to include Qualcomm chips?
"
1661,HOG,"Davidson: The great thing about tablets is they're a lot more like phones than laptops, and that is our sweet spot. We believe that devices should work more like phones — always connected, always on and always updating your network. Snapdragon will have a great impact on enabling all these new devices. Tablets to me have been the first wave of these new devices. We'll see experimentation with different form factors on tablets. I think we're just scratching the surface on the first wave of devices. We expect our partners to do some interesting things around different tablet devices.

1662,HOG,"IBD: Qualcomm has announced the first e-reader that's designed using your Mirasol display technology, from Korea's Kyobo.
"
1663,HOG,"Davidson: We're a big believer that battery technology has not evolved as quickly as other technologies and the display is the No. 1 power draw on devices. (Qualcomm says its Mirasol displays can show vibrant colors in bright sunlight and also ""allow for weeks of reading under typical usage"" on a single charge.) As data networks have grown, we knew people would be consuming more data and therefore looking at displays rather than talking. We saw that as an issue. We are looking at phone screens more, and we needed to solve the issue of displays being the No. 1 power hog in devices, with the additional benefit of being able to view the screens in full sunlight. Our existing foundries are being targeted at the e-reader market in fairly low volumes. Right now we are manufacturing those displays.
"
1664,HOG,"IBD: Does this mean Qualcomm will be a display maker?
"
1665,HOG,"Davidson: We have talked of having different options. We could continue the manufacturing (displays), license (the technology) or maybe a combination of both. Nothing has been decided. Mirasol was originally a venture investment for us. (The original company) had designed it to be used on everything digital, from watches to billboards.

1668,HOG,"On Wednesday, Terence Duffy, chairman of CME Group Inc., which owns the two institutions as well as the New York Mercantile Exchange, and Chief Financial Officer James Parisi announced the financial giant is considering moving operations and jobs out of the state in response to massive increases in state taxes.

1679,HOG,"Harley-Davidson, Inc. (HOG  -  Free Report) on Jun 25 announced that it will move part of its production out of the United States to avoid European Union EU tariffs. The announcement “surprised” President Donald Trump, who had earlier appreciated the iconic American motorcycle manufacturer for “building things in America.”Understandably, Trump’s decision to impose tariffs on imported steel and aluminum from China, the EU, Mexico and Canada along with threats of raising tariffs on imported cars and auto parts have raised worries among automakers, including Harley-Davidson.Fears of a trade war have already started taking its toll on a number of industries, with automakers suffering the most. Higher import duties mean a significant blow to the profits of a number of domestic automakers. Given this scenario, the imminent trade war will result in collateral damage for the entire auto industry.Harley, General Motors to Shift ProductionHarley announced that it will be shifting some of its production out of the United States to avoid EU tariffs. Harley’s decision follows Trump’s announcement of levying tariffs on imported steel and aluminum from the EU. Consequently, the EU announced tariffs on $3 billion worth of U.S. goods, including motorcycles. This would raise tariffs on U.S.-made motorcycles from 6% to a staggering 31%.Understandably, Harley can avoid the tariffs by shifting some of its production from the United States, as the company doesn’t intend to raise retail or wholesale prices. Harley accounted 16% of its sales from China in 2016, its biggest market outside the United States. Moreover, EU tariffs could result in Harley’s profits declining 5-8% in 2018.Similarly, General Motors Company (GM  -  Free Report) will be making its new Chevrolet Blazer at its Mexico plant. General Motors believes that Mexican plants have cheaper labor costs compared with U.S. plants. The decision could help General Motors avoid EU and China tariffs. However, it could also prove costly for the company as importing those vehicles back to the United States might attract higher tariffs.Ford Sales Drop in ChinaFord Motor Company’s (F  -  Free Report) China sales declined 29% in May from the year-ago period. The company’s vehicles sales in China came in at 61,744 units in May. Analysts see sentimental reasons stemming from the ongoing U.S.-China trade spat behind this drop. Ford is an iconic American brand and maybe Chinese consumers are upset with the United States.Something similar had happened in 2012, when sales of Toyota Motor Corporation (TM  -  Free Report), Honda Motor Co., Ltd. (HMC  -  Free Report) and Nissan Motor Co’s (NSANY  -  Free Report) China sales declined significantly during a dispute between the Chinese and Japanese governments. Toyota has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Broader Auto Sector Might Suffer  It’s not only the automakers but the overall auto sector, comprising carmakers, motorcycle manufacturers, car dealers, auto parts and transportation companies, that will feel the heat. According to a Moody’s (MCO  -  Free Report) report released on Monday, Trump’s proposed tariffs could harm the credit rating outlook for the global industry. The report also said that tariffs would be a negative for domestic carmakers like Ford and General Motors.Last week, Trump threatened to impose 20% tariffs on auto imports from the EU. Also, tariffs would particularly hit General Motors as it depends heavily on imports from Mexico and Canada to support its U.S operations. While 30% of General Motors’ U.S. unit sales are imported from Mexico and China, Ford imports 20% of its vehicles from these two countries. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V. (FCAU  -  Free Report) manufactures almost 50% of its vehicles in the United States, while the rest is primarily imported from its Mexico and Canada plants.  Catch-22Understandably, the trade spat between the United States and China, EU, Mexico and Canada now looks more like a double-edged sword. While producing vehicles in the United States could lead to higher tariffs in China and the EU, producing vehicles in Mexico and Canada and importing them back to the United States could mean paying higher import duty.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

1680,HOG,"Shares of Harley-Davidson Inc. (HOG  -  Free Report) fell 5.5% by Monday afternoon with news that the firm will be moving a portion of its European consumer production out of the United States to its international facilities. This news comes after the European Union imposed $3.2 billion in tariffs on the US on Friday, on goods including motorcycles, denim, and cigarettes, amongst others.The Big PictureAs our team highlighted, HOG foresees costs from these tariffs amounting to $100 million annually, and between $30 to $45 million for the rest of this year. The EU raised its 6% motorcycle tariff to 31%, which according to the firm makes each bike $2,200 more expensive to export.The firm also announced that it will not raise prices to cover costs, instead making this production shift to help soften the burden. HOG expects the increase in production in international plants to require incremental investment and to take between 9 to 18 months to be fully complete.More details about the financial implications of this move, as well as plans to mitigate the effects of the tariff, will be released during the firm’s Q2 earnings conference call in late July.Money Talks Europe is a key segment for HOG, representing the second largest portion of the firm’s total revenue, second only to the US. This news is the latest in a string of bad news for HOG. In its Q1 earnings report, HOG announced a 7.2% decrease in worldwide retail sales of motorcycles, guided primarily by weakening demand in the US. The firm believes the trend will continue, expecting to ship between 231,000-236,000 units of motorcycles in fiscal 2018, down from the 241,498 units in the previous year.These trends are reflected in the stock’s performance, which has seen a 16% loss in value over the last six months compared to the industry average of a 3% loss. Furthermore, the firm has seen a consistent downward trend in gross margin in recent quarters, falling 2.6% to 38.7% since Q4 2015, a reflection of rising costs and industry pains.OutlookAlthough recent news has been less than stellar, not all is bleak for the firm. The firm is making long-term investments to expand its product portfolio, aiming to launch 100 new motorcycles by 2027. The firm also plans to release electric motorcycles by as soon as 2019.Furthermore, HOG is increasing its international exposure, expecting an increase of 50% of yearly volume by 2027 and adding 150-200 new dealerships internationally by 2020. These initiatives will help reduce the effect of consumer trends in the US.HOG currently sits at a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and holds an “A” grade for Value in our Style Scores system. While the firm is projected to see a 2.6% decrease in EPS this fiscal year to $3.38, it is also projected to see a 17.1% increase next fiscal year to $3.96 based on recent earnings estimate revisions. Overall, the stock is one that investors should remain vigilant in monitoring moving forward.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

1682,HOG,"This week looks to be an important one for housing metrics, with New Homes Sales totals being released after the bell today, the Case-Shiller home price index hitting the tape tomorrow, and Pending Home Sales Wednesday. For this morning, however, we once again look toward increased pressure in the burgeoning “trade war” with China, and market futures are back in the red this pre-market.President Trump now looks to curb Chinese investment in American companies, or more specifically firms with 25% Chinese ownership. This would include limits on Chinese investment in U.S. companies with “industrially significant technology.” Sectors featuring “Made in China 2025” companies would be targeted, and this new policy could take effect one month from now.This new reveal looks to get tougher on specific business affected by past trade policies between the U.S. and China, whereby we have endured injustices such as theft of intellectual property (IP) at the hands of Chinese firms looking to beat copyright restrictions in U.S. law. The already imposed steel and aluminum tariffs against most of our trading partners, including Mexico, Canada and the EU, cut a much wider swath of the global trade fabric, and what worries many analysts are the scenarios in which countries like China begin to work in strategic alignment with these countries against U.S. interests.While major domestic indexes are indeed down in today’s pre-trading — especially the Dow, which aside from Friday’s close in positive territory, looks to see its 9th down day in the last 10 sessions — we also see more than 1% drops in the Hang Seng and Shanghai indexes from overnight. So while we rightly remain focused on challenges here at home, perhaps there is some comfort to be derived from Chinese investors having a hard time with new bilateral trade policies as well.Aside from market activity, which reliably provides a forward outlook in the U.S. economy about eight or nine months, do we see any direct impact domestically as a result of these trade tensions? Actually, we do: with targeted tariffs on American-made motorcycles, Milwaukee, WI-based Harley-Davidson (HOG  -  Free Report) foresees costs from these tariffs amounting to $100 million a year. As a result, the company now looks to take at least part of its manufacturing overseas.This wouldn’t be the first time Harley has come to this decision in 2018, either. When the company closed its Kansas City plant this past winter, it cost the company 800 domestic jobs. Importantly, this decision was made well before trade tariffs but following the windfall corporate tax cuts passed by Congress late last year. These jobs were reportedly outsourced to a new motorcycle plant in Thailand, and further cost savings for manufacturing now that tariffs on Harley products are a reality might be made by relocating additional workforce to the same plant.

1683,HOG,"The Auto sector has been seeing a slew of first-quarter 2018 earnings releases of late. Many of the bigwigs are slated to release results for the quarter ending Mar 31, 2018, by the end of this week. On Apr 19, Genuine Parts Company (GPC  -  Free Report) and WABCO Holdings Inc. (WBC  -  Free Report) reported first-quarter earnings. WABCO reported earnings beat for the quarter, while Genuine Parts missed the estimate.Per the latest Earnings Preview, 87 companies under the S&P 500 category have reported results.

However, the S&P 500 companies are likely to see 18.3% and 7.7% year-over-year growth in earnings and revenues, respectively, in the quarter.In March, the automakers made a comeback after seeing declining U.S. sales in February 2018. An improved economy, product launches and customer discounts have helped auto companies witness a year-over-year rise in new vehicle sales. This uptick has encouraged automakers to introduce improved SUV and pick-up truck models under various brands, each catering to specific customer requirements. Further, a number of major auto companies have announced newer models which are expected to hit the showrooms in 2019.Meanwhile, in the world’s largest automotive market China, auto sales rose 4.7% year over year to 2.66 million units in March after an 11% drop in February 2018. Per the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers, first-quarter vehicles sales rose 2.8% on a year-over-year basis to around 7.2 million units.Now, let’s take a closer look at two big names in the auto industry — Harley-Davidson, Inc.

1684,HOG,"Harley-Davidson, Inc. (HOG  -  Free Report) is set to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 24, before the opening bell. Last quarter, it delivered a positive surprise of 17.4%. Of the trailing four quarters, the company surpassed estimates in three while meeting in one. The average positive surprise came in 7.9%.In the last three months, shares of Harley-Davidson have underperformed the industry it belongs to. The stock has lost 23.9% compared with the industry’s 11.3% decline.Let’s see, how things have shaped up for the upcoming announcement.Harley-Davidson, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Harley-Davidson, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Harley-Davidson, Inc. QuoteFactors Influencing This QuarterIn first-quarter 2018, Harley-Davidson expects to ship 60,000-65,000 units of motorcycles compared with 70,831, shipped in the year-ago period. This decline in anticipation is primarily due to high competition, global economic uncertainty and softness in the market.Also, the company’s stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for annual earnings being revised 0.3% downward over the last seven days.In March, Harley-Davidson reported its investment and teaming up with Alta Motors for developing electric-motorcycle technology along with a focus on product developments. This progress of Harley-Davidson’s investment in EV technology is in line with its 10-year strategy to build next-generation riders. Also, the company aims to introduce its first electric motorcycle in 2019.For first-quarter 2018, the company earlier announced a cash dividend of 37 cents per share paid on Mar 2, reflecting a hike of 1.4% from 36.5 cents a year ago. Additionally, its board authorized to repurchase up to 15 million common shares, which adds to its existing share-repurchase authorization, approved in February 2016.For the soon-to-be-released quarterly results, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues of Motorcycles and Related Products segment is pegged at $1.24 billion, up from the fourth quarter’s total revenues of $1.04 billion.Similarly, consensus estimates for total revenues of the company’s Financial Services segment stand at $175 million, down from the fourth quarter’s total revenues of $182 million.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Harley-Davidson is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because, a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Harley-Davidson has an Earnings ESP of -8.35% as the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at $1 and $1.09, respectively. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Harley-Davidson carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Further, this, combined with its Earnings ESP, makes the surprise prediction difficult. Note that we caution against Rank #4  and 5 (Strong Sell) stocks going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few stocks worth considering from the same space, with the right combination of elements to outpace earnings estimates this time around:BorgWarner Inc. (BWA  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.33% and a Zacks Rank #2. Its first-quarter 2018 results are expected to be released on Apr 26.

1685,HOG,"Somewhat easing the tension of a trade war, China announced that it will erase the limit on foreign ownership of domestic auto ventures. This will assist foreign automakers to own factories in the country. Notably, this restriction has been in place since 1994, which limits foreign carmakers to own not more than 50% share of any local establishment.China will lift foreign ownership limit for the wider car market by 2022. This may open up opportunities for U.S. automakers and enable them to earn higher profits. But disentangling the network of collaborations forged with local Chinese companies may not be easy.The past week also saw General Motors Company (GM  -  Free Report) announcing layoffs of around 1,500 workers at its plant in Lordstown, OH, per CNBC. The auto giant took such a decision due to the dramatically slowing demand for compact cars.(Read the previous roundup here: Auto Stock Roundup for Apr 12, 2018)Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    Per Reuters, Volkswagen AG’s (VLKAY  -  Free Report) Truck & Bus GmbH unit agreed to form a strategic alliance with Hino Motors, Ltd., a subsidiary of Toyota Motor Corporation (TM  -  Free Report), to develop self-driving capabilities and lower-emission vehicles.Intended to strengthen their market position as commercial-vehicle manufacturers, the two automakers will join forces to deal with rising investment costs related to the development of autonomous vehicles and new transportation services, including ride sharing.The combined forces will work on research and development, technology and procurement of gasoline-electric and diesel hybrid engines as well as self-driving technologies. This will enable both the companies to benefit from the economies of scale and come up with innovative products at a faster pace compared with the time required while working separately.However, the partnership between the two subsidiary units will not change the competitive dynamics between Volkswagen and Toyota in the passenger-car market.

The newly formed unit will be headed by Essendant’s chief executive officer (CEO) Ric Phillips. Rick Toppin, CEO of S.P. Richards, will be the chief operating officer of the new entity. The combination of Essendant and S.P. Richards will result in a more competitive business products distributor with higher scale and service capabilities along with greater ability to support customers.The deal is structured as a Reverse Morris Trust. The transaction values S.P. Richards at approximately $680 million. Atlanta, GA-based Genuine Parts will receive $347 million in cash while the shareholders of the company will own around 51% of the combined company, post closing. The deal is slated to close before the end of 2018. However, it is subject to regulatory and shareholder approvals, and satisfaction of certain other customary closing conditions.Notably, Essendant is a wholesale distributor of workplace items whereas S.P.

The auto giant took such a decision due to the dramatically slowing demand for compact cars. Notably, the plant only manufactures the Chevy Cruze model and employs around 3,000 workers.In fact, the demand for sedans has declined steeply in recent times. This year, car sales have declined 13.2% while that of SUVs, crossovers and pickups rose 7%. For Chevy Cruze, the sales decline has been steeper. Per Autodata, Chevy Cruze sales plunged 28% in 2018. In 2017, over 184,000 Cruze models were sold in the United States compared with 273,000 vehicles in 2013.The facility will be slowing the assembly lines by eliminating one of the two shifts, starting from mid-June.

(TSLA  -  Free Report) set a target to manufacture 6,000 Model 3 cars each week by the end of June to meet its weekly target of 5,000 Model 3 units by the end of second-quarter 2018, per Bloomberg. The difference includes a margin for error of the product parts. The news was first tracked by Electrek from an email by the company’s CEO to the employees.At the beginning of the month, Tesla reported unit productions for the first quarter of 2018. The company manufactured 2,020 Model 3 vehicles per week in the first quarter, thus lagging the target of manufacturing 2,500 Model 3 units per week. This shortfall in unit production prompted the company to set an internal target of 6,000 units to realize the 5k target.Per the company’s CEO, the recent temporary suspension of Model 3 production is planned to eliminate the bottlenecks that have delayed production. This will help Tesla to reach 3000-4000 Model 3 productions per week in May. Further, a similar suspension is expected at its two factories in California and Nevada to update the units in May. (Read more: Tesla Hikes Model 3 Production Target to 6K per Week)Tesla carries a Zacks Rank #3.5.    Group 1 Automotive, Inc. acquired a new Toyota sales territory in western Sao Paulo of Brazil. Additionally, the company expanded an existing Honda dealership in Sao Bernardo do Campo, situated in the suburb of Sao Paulo.The newly acquired business will function under T-Drive Toyota Alphaville and is anticipated to generate roughly $45 million in yearly revenues. With this acquisition, T-Drive Toyota Alphaville became Group 1 Automotive’s fourth Toyota dealership in Brazil. Further, the company was given a few additional Toyota points of representation inside the Sao Paulo market. Names and locations of these points will be announced once those get functional.Per management, this acquisition, along with Group 1 Automotive’s existing stores, will generate opportunities and growth potential by offering a large Toyota operating footprint across Brazil’s largest city.

1686,HOG,"The past week saw heightened activities from auto companies such as General Motors Company (GM  -  Free Report) and Magna International Inc. in the self-driving vehicles front. While General Motors promised investment for upgrading self-driving vehicles manufacturing, Magna announced a partnership with the ride sharing company Lyft, to finance, build and manufacture self-driving systems.However, this week self-driving activities suffered a setback as a test vehicle from leading ridesharing company, Uber Technologies Inc. struck and killed a 49-year-old woman in Tempe, AZ. Safety issues apart, this sad incident gave a jolt to the self-driving car industry, which is witnessing billions of dollars of investment and has the potential to be a game changer in the transportation space.On the positive side, the week also saw some relaxation in the imposition of tariffs for Canada and Mexico, keeping in mind the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) negotiations. President Trump dropped the initial proposal that vehicles manufactured in Canada and Mexico and intended for the U.S. market should contain at least 50% American materials. This has somewhat relieved the auto industry.(Read the previous roundup here: Auto Stock Roundup for Mar 15, 2018)Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    Superior Industries International Inc.’s (SUP  -  Free Report) adjusted earnings of 38 cents per share for fourth-quarter 2017 topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 24 cents. Including after-tax expense and the impact of U.S. tax reform, net loss for the quarter was $4.6 million or 50 cents per share.Revenues were $361.8 million in the reported quarter, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $363.8 million. However, the reported figure was higher than $188.3 million recorded in the year-ago quarter.Wheel unit shipments were 5.4 million compared with 3.1 million in the prior-year quarter. The rise was primarily due to the addition of its European operations, partly offset by a decline in the North American market  from the prior-year quarter. Value-added sales, i.e., net sales minus pass-through charges for aluminum, increased to $203.5 million compared with $106.4 million in fourth-quarter 2016.Gross profit rose to $39.7 million from $18 million in the year-ago quarter. The increase was due to the addition of European operations, partly offset by non-recurring effects of purchase accounting adjustments of $1.3 million related to the buyout of UNIWHEELS and ongoing amortization of intangibles related to the acquisition.

1687,HOG,"In the past week, electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer Tesla, Inc. (TSLA  -  Free Report) raised prices of Model X and Model S vehicles by 20% in China. In fact, Tesla is the first automaker to increase prices in the world’s largest automotive market. Moreover, the company inked a deal to build its first factory outside the United States. With this factory in Shanghai, Tesla will be the first wholly-owned foreign automaker in China. The automaker resorted to this move as the U.S.-China trade war started affecting auto companies. Furthermore, the promise made by the Chinese authorities in April to end restrictions, which required foreign automakers to collaborate with local partners, might have prompted this automaker to take such a decision.However, Ford Motor Company (F  -  Free Report) announced that it has no plan to raise prices of imported vehicle lineups in China, including high-margin luxury Lincoln models. In other words, the company is going to absorb additional tariffs levied on U.S.-manufactured automobiles.In another development, General Motors Company (GM  -  Free Report) announced an increase in the production of Chevrolet Bolt EV. Rising demand for this auto giant’s electric compact crossover prompted it to increase its production.(Read the previous roundup here: Auto Stock Roundup for Jul 5, 2018)Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    Volkswagen AG (VLKAY  -  Free Report) has plans to introduce car-sharing services with all-electric cars in 2019, per Reuters. The company will initially launch the service in Germany and expand in other major cities of Europe, Asia and North America by early 2020.This introduction of mobility service is Volkswagen’s attempt to provide an alternative option to customers, who do not prefer owning a car. The new shared-mobility facility will be added to the company’s existing division, MOIA. Founded in 2016, the division aims at developing and offering an extensive portfolio of on-demand mobility services.In Germany, Volkswagen’s car-sharing service is going to face strong competition from DriveNow and Car2Go, launched by two major German automakers, which are set to merge soon to beat counterparts like Uber Technologies.Volkswagen might witness rise in demand for its lineup of EVs, owing to the unveiling of the mobility service. The company intends to sell around 1 million electric cars by 2025. Per management, with its existing plans, the company might actually be able to sell more than the set target.

The growing demand for this auto giant’s electric compact crossover has prompted it to increase production.General Motors stated that its battery-electric car is in huge demand in the United States and across the globe. The company anticipates global sales to be more than 35% for second-quarter 2018 and more than 40% in the first half of 2018. Its plan of extra production will help it keep pace with the growing demand for Bolt EV and restore its inventory level. Importantly, this is in line with the company’s vision of a world with zero emissions.General Motors introduced Bolt EV in late 2016. The 2018 Bolt offers a 238-mile driving range from its 60 kWh battery pack, though the company hasn’t yet come out with updated specs for the 2019 model.

With this factory in Shanghai, this electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer will be the first wholly-owned foreign automaker in China. The deal was announced after Tesla raised prices of Model X and Model S vehicles by 20% in China. The automaker resorted to this move as the U.S.-China trade war started to affect auto companies. Moreover, the promise made by the Chinese authorities in April to end restrictions, which required foreign automakers to tie up with local partners, might have prompted this automaker to take such a decision.Importantly, China is the world’s biggest EV market. But Tesla and many other automakers were unwilling to shift their manufacturing facilities to this country because of the restriction to share technology with local partners. For Tesla, China is the second largest market after the United States.Tesla stated that the construction for the new factory would start only after the necessary official permits are obtained. No details of the deal have been provided. However, this may turn out to be the biggest foreign investment in Shanghai.

This decision indicates that the company is going to absorb additional tariffs on U.S.-manufactured automobiles, beginning Jul 6.In May, Ford and Lincoln had reduced prices of imported models in China. The decision was taken after the Chinese government announced tariff cuts for automobiles, effective Jul 1. However, with Trump's tariff implementation on $34-billion Chinese imports, China recently announced an additional 25% levy on 545 American products that includes U.S.-produced vehicles.Ford’s decision is expected to hurt its profit margins, which is already witnessing sluggish sales in the largest automotive market, China.

1688,HOG,"Many American businesses are already facing disruptions in sales and supply chains as the trade war is setting in. Though U.S. tariffs were supposed to help its businesses, exporters are expected to be negatively affected by them.Due to the anticipated spike in the price of steel and aluminum, companies that use those raw materials are expecting their cost of production to rise. Meanwhile, due to foreign countries’ retaliatory tariffs, U.S. companies are anticipating higher costs in shipping and lower demand from international customers. Some main industries and companies to take note of are Harley-Davidson (HOG  -  Free Report), the U.S. soybean business, and German motor companies. Let’s take a closer look.Harley DavidsonHarley-Davidson Inc., a motorcycle maker, is afflicted by both the U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum and the European Union’s retaliatory tariffs.U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum could increase the company’s bill for raw materials by as much as $20 million this year. In addition to that, the 31% tariffs the E.U. enacted would raise the cost of each bike it ships from the U.S by about $2,200.In response to that, Harley said it will have to shift production of some cycles overseas to offset E.U. tariffs.  This will cost as much as $100 million annually, but with its lowly position in the trade war, the company doesn’t have much choice.SoybeansLast Friday, the U.S. imposed tariffs on $34 billion worth of imported Chinese machinery, auto parts, medical devices, and other goods. In response, China said it is going to immediately impose equivalent tariffs that would cover 545 categories of U.S. products—including soybeans.Soybean farmers are now facing plunging prices. Paul Burke from the U.S. Soybean Export Council told The Wall Street Journal that Chinese importers have mostly stopped buying U.S. soybeans. China imported about $14 billion in U.S. soybeans last year, making soybeans the top item targeted by China’s proposed tariffs, according to Wind Information via the WSJ.  Auto CompaniesGermany’s Mercedes-maker Daimler (DDAIF  -  Free Report) and BMW (BAMXF  -  Free Report) sell U.S.-made sport utility vehicles in China. Starting last Friday, those vehicles were subject to a 40% tariff.These motor companies, along with Ford (F  -  Free Report) and Tesla (TSLA  -  Free Report) of the U.S., are expected to be most affected from the tariffs as they export a large amount of their vehicles to China.BMW and Daimler are particularly vulnerable to this tit-for-tat U.S. – China trade war. Both companies have huge factories in the southern U.S., with thousands of employers that build vehicles for export to China and Europe.The tariffs leave the companies with two choices: raise the price for customers in China or absorb the added costs. Though possible long-term plans include shutting down a plant or shifting production to other markets, such plans take years to plan and require even more additional cost. All in all, these auto companies surely are on the losing front of the trade war.Bottom LineAs of now, Trump is planning on a second round of tariffs on an additional $16 billion worth of goods, which will probably go into effect in August.According to The Wall Street Journal, China experts think that the two main sides of this trade war—China and the U.S.—are likely to start negotiations again when the impact of tariffs become too big, and markets begin to react.U.S. manufacturers will face tough decisions in coming months over whether to raise prices for their consumers or cover the higher costs themselves. As long as there is a possibility for more tariffs on imports from China, U.S. manufacturers will most likely halt their investments on domestic supply chains.However, there is always a level of uncertainty regarding how the tariff dispute will actually turn out—causing decision making to be even more difficult for these companies.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

1689,HOG,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Harley-Davidson, Inc. (HOG  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Harley-Davidson has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 13.6, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 20.6. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, Harley-Davidson’s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years, with the number having risen over the past few months.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the broader industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 12.3. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that Harley-Davidson has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of 14.39, which is tad higher than the current level. So it is fair to expect an increase in the company’s share price in the near term.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Harley-Davidson has a P/S ratio of about 1.5. This is a bit lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.2x right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years. If anything, HOG is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P/S metric, suggesting some level of undervalued trading—at least compared to historical norms.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Harley-Davidson currently has a Value Score of A, putting it into the top 20% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes Harley-Davidson a solid choice for value investors.What About the Stock Overall?Though Harley-Davidson might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of C and a Momentum Score of F. This gives HOG a Zacks VGM score — or its overarching fundamental grade — of D. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been unfavorable. The current quarter has seen eight estimates go lower in the past sixty days, while the full year estimate has nine down in the same time period.This has had a significant impact on the consensus estimate as the current quarter consensus estimate has decreased 14.2% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has dropped 2.3%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Harley-Davidson, Inc. Price and Consensus  Harley-Davidson, Inc. Price and Consensus | Harley-Davidson, Inc. Quote The stock has Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) indicating probabilities for in-line performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineHarley-Davidson is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Furthermore, a strong industry rank (among Top 16% of more than 250 industries) boosts investor confidence. However, over the past two years, the broader industry has clearly underperformed the broader market, as you can see below:So, value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick.5 Trades Could Profit """"Big-League"""" from Trump PoliciesIf the stocks above spark your interest, wait until you look into companies primed to make substantial gains from Washington's changing course.Today Zacks reveals 5 tickers that could benefit from new trends like streamlined drug approvals, tariffs, lower taxes, higher interest rates, and spending surges in defense and infrastructure.See these buy recommendations now >>

1691,HOG,"Per Reuters, Harley-Davidson, Inc. (HOG  -  Free Report) is expected to experience a period of continued weak sales, driven by low demand of new Harley motorcycles.Recent researches show that millennials prefer buying less-expensive, used Harley-Davidson models or cheaper versions of other brands rather than going for new Harley-Davidson motorcycles. Also, the company’s ageing core customer group and low prices of Harley-Davidson’s used-motorcycles are other concerns it currently faces in the United States.Owning a well-known brand at a low-cost budget encourage young Americans to buy used-motorcycles of the brand, Harley-Davidson, while paying their home and student loans. Per analysis, people are still interested in the brand, as they buy used-motorcycles, which definitely do not benefit the company or its shareholders.Harley-Davidson, Inc. Price and Consensus  Harley-Davidson, Inc. Price and Consensus | Harley-Davidson, Inc. QuoteThese problems have led to its U.S. sales decline, contributing almost 60% of Harley-Davidson’s total sales. Last fiscal year, the U.S. sales hit a five-year decrease. Plus, last quarter, the same segment sales fell 9.3% to 49,668 motorcycles.However, Harley-Davidson has been trying to recover and benefit from the growing used-motorcycle segment and reach new customers besides the existing lot.

1692,HOG,"The week saw the release of the auto sales report for the month of June. U.S. auto sales jumped in the month, defying the odds of rising interest rates, higher gas prices and large supply of used vehicles. While the first half of the year saw auto sales rise 1.8%, sales in June increased 5% compared with a year ago. Strong consumer confidence and low level of unemployment boosted auto sales.There is however the lurking fear of this joyride being derailed due to President Trump’s proposed tariffs. In fact, the auto industry, which relies heavily on a complicated global supply chain and is adapting to a spate of technological changes such as autonomous and electric vehicles (EVs) technology, is likely to be adversely impacted by this trade policy.Other than the June sales report and tariff concerns, the week saw Tesla, Inc.’s (TSLA  -  Free Report) vehicle production reaching a historic level in the second quarter of 2018, making it the most-productive three-month period.

1693,HOG,"According to Moody’s Investors Service, President Donald Trump’s warning to impose 25% tariffs on imported cars and car parts will have serious impact not only on the U.S. automobile industry but also on the global auto industry. In fact, the auto industry, which is heavily dependent on a complicated global supply chain and is embracing a gamut of technological changes such as autonomous and electric vehicles (EVs) technology, is vulnerable to distortionary trade policy. Another group that will also be badly hurt is U.S. car dealers and parts manufactures, which depend on imports. Trump issued warnings to its trade partners, asking them to repeal tariffs or face the consequences. Trump has already cautioned China that the United States will impose additional retaliatory tariffs on exports if China slaps tariffs on U.S. exports. Trump also threatened to slap 20% tariffs on European vehicles in response to the European Union’s (EU) decision to impose 25% tariffs on more than $3 billion in U.S. goods as retaliation for U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum.Autos’ Impending PainsThe effects of these announcements have already started to show up. Harley-Davidson, Inc. (HOG  -  Free Report) announced its plan to shift the manufacturing of its motorcycles in the United States — which are sold in EU — to international facilities. The decision was taken after EU hiked import tariffs to 31% for products manufactured in the United States, effective Jun 22, 2018.Moody’s predicts Ford Motor Co. (F  -  Free Report) and General Motors Co. (GM  -  Free Report) to be impacted by the tariffs right away, as both these auto giants import a large number of vehicles from Canada and Mexico to the United States. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCAU  -  Free Report) manufactures about half its vehicles in the United States, with the remaining units imported primarily from Canada and Mexico.Looking toward Asia, car makers from Japan and Korea will be forced to make major changes to their domestic production if tariffs are slapped. While Toyota Motor Co. (TM  -  Free Report), Nissan Motor Co. Ltd. (NSANY  -  Free Report) and Honda Motor Co.

1694,HOG,"Not only electric vehicles (EVs) but electric trucks have also grabbed the attention of the automakers around the world. Due to its emission-free nature and cost-effective maintenance feature, electric trucks are slowly gaining traction in the auto space.German auto major Volkswagen AG (VLKAY  -  Free Report) has made a huge investment in this space. Similarly, Tesla Inc. (TSLA  -  Free Report)  announced its plan to launch heavy-duty semi truck, with a 500-mile range, for longer distance. Recently, Daimler AG (DDAIF  -  Free Report) announced its plan to launch a fully-electric semi-trailer truck, the production of which will start in 2021. However, the success of electric trucks will hugely depend on the availability of batteries along with its capacity and range.Alongside activities on the electric truck front, the week also saw Tesla making an announcement to downsize its workforce by around 9% to lower costs for becoming sustainably profitable, without compromising on its Model 3 sedan production goals. This downsizing will not impact the ability of the company to achieve the Model 3 production target in the near future.(Read the previous roundup here: Auto Stock Roundup for Jun 7, 2018)Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    In a big development, General Motors Company (GM  -  Free Report) and Honda Motor Co., Ltd. (HMC  -  Free Report) signed an agreement to work together to develop batteries for EVs, mainly for the North American market. This agreement will take into account new advanced battery components — including cell and module — in turn, promoting plans of both auto majors to move to all-electric vehicles in the future. The companies will come together to save costs, using General Motors’ next-generation battery system.General Motors and Honda already work in tandem on zero-emission fuel cell vehicles. In fact, these companies have formed the industry’s first manufacturing joint venture to produce an advanced hydrogen fuel cell system by 2020. The integrated development teams are working to deliver a more affordable commercial solution for fuel cell and hydrogen storage systems.Besides these ongoing joint developments and production of fuel cells, the latest battery component collaboration will enable both automakers to take a step toward all EVs.

You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.2.    Per Reuters, Daimler announced that it will launch a fully-electric semi-trailer truck, the production of which will start in 2021. The 18-wheeler and 250-mile ranged Freightliner eCascadia is meant for regional deliveries and port services.In addition to this, Daimler also launched a medium-duty Freightliner eM2 106, designed for local deliveries, with a range of up to 230 miles. In late 2018, the company plans to deliver 30 prototypes of the two models for field-testing by the customers.Further, Daimler announced the opening of a new research center in Portland, which will work on research and development (R&D) of autonomous freight trucks. The center will work along with the company’s other centers situated in Germany and India.In order to develop Daimler’s truck operations, R&D investment of more than €2.5 billion ($2.9 billion) will be made in 2018 and 2019. Out of the total amount, around 20% will be used for electrification, connected vehicles and autonomous driving technology.

This will also aid it to become sustainably profitable without compromising on its Model 3 sedan production goals. Per Reuters, this layoff decision is in sync with the carmaker’s strategy to simplify its management structure.The chief executive officer, Elon Musk informed that the job cuts mostly include the salaried staff and this won’t affect the workers in the production assembly lines. In other words, this downsizing will not impact the ability of the company to achieve the Model 3 production target in near future.Albeit rising sales, Tesla remains a loss-making company. The loss is expected due to significant investments made toward developing new vehicles and technologies along with the establishment of a retail network. It is expected that the company may find it difficult to achieve sustained net profits until Model 3 enters full-scale production. The latest move to cut down employment is in sync with the company’s efforts to lower costs and become profitable without backtracking from Model 3 production goals.

The investment made by this Japanese carmaker is the largest-ever by a vehicle maker in the global ride-hailing space.Grab offers ride-hailing, ride-sharing and logistics services in Southeast Asian nations, including Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand and Indonesia. In early 2018, Grab acquired Southeast Asian operations of Uber, the San Francisco, CA-based ride-sharing company. Toyota’s investment will allow Grab to broaden its range of services, including digital payments and food delivery, into the region.Toyota informed that by strengthening the partnership, it anticipates achieving connectivity for Grab’s rental-car fleet across Southeast Asia while offering myriad services to the drivers. Alongside Grab, Toyota will develop services that are more secure and lucrative for its customers.

This is one of the highest fines leveled against a company by the German authorities. This German automaker accepted the allegations and shouldered responsibility for that.Volkswagen failed to adequately supervise activities of the engine development department. This resulted in 10.7 million diesel vehicles with illegal emission-controlling software being sold worldwide. In fact, the auto giant is grappled with the same scandal since 2015, which surfaced in the United States. The German automaker has already paid $20 billion in fines and civil settlements in the United States.This penalty is the latest blow to the German auto industry, which is grappling with diesel emission scandals. Recently, another German vehicle giant, Daimler has been ordered by the government to recall about 240,000 cars, fitted with prohibited emission-control devices.Volkswagen currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).PerformanceLast week, all companies in the space recorded an increase in share prices, except Toyota.

1695,HOG,"The majority of auto companies have already reported their first-quarter 2018 results. Some important companies such as General Motors Company (GM  -  Free Report), Ford Motor Company (F  -  Free Report) and Harley-Davidson Inc. (HOG  -  Free Report) reported their quarterly numbers recently. All these companies reported an earnings beat in the quarter under review.Auto companies, scheduled to report earnings on May 3 are BMW AG (BAMXF  -  Free Report), Ferrari N.V. (RACE  -  Free Report), Adient plc (ADNT  -  Free Report) and CarGurus, Inc. (CARG  -  Free Report).Per the Earnings Preview, as of Apr 25, 154 S&P 500 companies  announced results. The earnings and revenue beat ratios for these companies are 80.5% and 72.1%, respectively.First-quarter 2018 earnings and revenue growth for auto companies are expected to be in the negative territory. Auto stocks are expected to register a 7.9% and 3.2% year-over-year decline in earnings and revenues, respectively. However, during the first quarter, the S&P 500 companies are anticipated to record 20% and 8% year-over-year growth in earnings and revenues, respectively.In fact, the auto sector, which is plagued with myriad problems, reported solid sales in March 2018. After a slow start in 2018, major automakers reported robust sales in March. A strong job market and tax reforms drove consumer demand, which in turn aided sales.In Europe, automakers are witnessing a decline in vehicle sales. Per European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association, vehicle registrations edged down 0.6% in first-quarter 2018. This decline was majorly due to slowing economic growth and uncertain trading regulations.Let’s take a look at four auto companies, which are scheduled to announce their results tomorrow.We relied on the Zacks methodology, combining a favorable Zacks Rank — #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — and a positive Earnings ESP to predict chances of a beat this quarter.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Per our proprietary methodology, Earnings ESP shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate.

1697,HOG,"Similar to wise buying decisions, exiting certain underperformers at the right time helps maximize portfolio returns. Selling off losers can be difficult, but if both the share price and estimates are falling, it could be time to get rid of the security before more losses hit your portfolio.One such stock that you may want to consider dropping Harley-Davidson, Inc. (HOG  -  Free Report), which has witnessed a significant price decline in the past four weeks, and it has seen negative earnings estimate revisions for the current quarter and the current year. A Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) further confirms weakness in HOG.A key reason for this move has been the negative trend in earnings estimate revisions. For the full year, we have seen eight estimates moving down in the past 30 days, compared with just no upward revisions. This trend has caused the consensus estimate to trend lower, going from $3.77 a share a month ago to its current level of $3.42.Harley-Davidson, Inc. Price and Consensus Harley-Davidson, Inc. Price and Consensus | Harley-Davidson, Inc. QuoteAlso, for the current quarter, Harley-Davidsonhas seen seven downward estimate revisions versus one revision in the opposite direction, dragging the consensus estimate down to 41 cents a share from 80 cents over the past 30 days. The stock also has seen some pretty dismal trading lately, as the share price has dropped 8.5% in the past month.So it may not be a good decision to keep this stock in your portfolio anymore, at least if you don’t have a long time horizon to wait.If you are still interested in the Automotive - Domesticindustry, you may instead consider a better-ranked stock - Fox Factory Holding Corp.

1699,HOG,"The last week saw auto companies coming up with February 2018 sales figures. Most of them witnessed sales decline during the month. Per the sales data provided by Autodata Corp, the seasonally adjusted annualized rate (SAAR) of U.S. car and light truck sales fell to 17.08 million units in February from 17.45 million in February 2017. Both General Motors Company (GM  -  Free Report) and Ford Motor Company (F  -  Free Report) reported a 6.9% decline in U.S. sales. Again, sales of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V.

The only exception was Toyota Motor Corporation (TM  -  Free Report), which witnessed a 4.5% rise in sales.In addition to the February sales slide, the recent proposal by Donald Trump to impose steep tariffs on imports of steel and aluminum, which are widely used by automobile companies, has put these companies on back gear. If the tariff is imposed, U.S. automotive companies would lose their level-playing competitive capabilities to global rivals and will be badly hit.Apart from those two important developments, there was the usual alacrity from the auto companies in the electric and autonomomous vehicles front. Earnings announcements also continued in the past week.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    Harley-Davidson, Inc. (HOG  -  Free Report) reported that it has invested in Alta Motors. Headquartered in Brisbane, CA, Alta Motors is a manufacturer of advanced electric motorcycles and lightweight electric vehicles drivetrains.

In fact, Lithia Motors, the leading automotive retailer in the United States, aims at building strong franchised stores in key marketplaces, where the company is yet to realize its full potential.The company has stated that this latest acquisition, along with the earlier declared acquisitions of Day Auto Group and Ray Laks, has generated annual steady state revenues of over $1.3 billion in the first two months of 2018. This has prompted Lithia Motors to raise its 2018 outlook for annual revenues in the band of $12-$12.5 billion and earnings per share to $10.60.

This upside was primarily prompted by strong demand of its affordably priced travel trailers. Pre-tax income shot up 49.7% to $116.7 million from $78 million in the comparable quarter, last fiscal.

1702,HOG,"Pre-market futures are once again in the red this morning, in a holiday-shortened week that will be cleaved in half with Wednesday’s observance of Independence Day, when the U.S. shook off control of a hostile foreign power following passage of the most egalitarian governmental policy document in the history of the world, July 4, 1776 — a mere 242 years ago; a blink in the history of time.We “celebrate” the week of the 4th of July, not to mention the first trading day of the second half of the calendar year, re-stoking the fires of a global trade war, with President Trump over the weekend calling the European Union (EU) “worse than China” on trade with the U.S., and threatening a 20% tariff on imported foreign cars from Europe. This would effect companies like Daimler AG, which owns the Mercedes brand of vehicles. The EU, in return, has earmarked a total of $294 billion in U.S. goods imported to Europe if Trump goes after car imports.We’ve already seen how threats to EU imports have impacted companies like Harley-Davidson (HOG  -  Free Report) and Kentucky bourbon distributor Brown-Forman (BF.B  -  Free Report). This morning, Zacks Stock Strategist David Borun contemplates which corporate domino might be next to fall amid our current trade friction scenario: Harley-Davidson Reacts to EU Tariffs; Who’s Next?For Canada’s part, our neighbor to the north’s retaliatory measures are even more specific: while the country looks to charge 25% on imported U.S. steel and iron, a further 10% tax would be levied on consumer goods from tomato ketchup to coffee beans to dishwasher soap, totaling $12.6 billion in goods, total. This would have a negative effect on companies like Colgate-Palmolive (CL  -  Free Report) and Kraft Heinz (KHC  -  Free Report).Mexico has just elected a new president, leftist Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador (known as AMLO), so it remains to be seen how new leadership in the country will deal with Trump’s new trade tactics. Reportedly, the country has already targeted U.S. imports on items like Florida orange juice such as Minute Maid, owned by The Coca Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report).June PMI ManufacturingWe see some key manufacturing data for the month of June this morning after the opening bell: Project Management Institute (PMI) and Institute for Supply Management (ISM) results. The Markit Manufacturing PMI's previous month reported 54.6. ISM reports new results around 10am ET, along with new Construction spending for May. ISM is expected to come in at 58.3% for June following the 58.7% previously, whereas construction looks for break-even results after a +1.8% headline read in the prior month.

General Motors Company (GM  -  Free Report) is no longer reporting monthly sales and planned to report the figures on a quarterly basis instead.

General Motors Company (GM  -  Free Report) and Toyota Motor Corporation (TM  -  Free Report) reported an increase in January sales, whereas Ford Motor Company (F  -  Free Report) and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V. reported year-over-year sales decline.Major automakers expect 2018 auto sales to remain weak.

1707,HOG,"The auto sector is currently facing a lot of challenges. The problem of high-levels of inventory is putting pressure on auto stocks.In fact, General Motors Company (GM  -  Free Report) has lowered the outlook for new vehicle sales in the U.S. in 2017. This is an indication of the industry heading for a moderate downturn in 2017. A glut in nearly-new used vehicles is expected to undermine sales this year.Added to this, the U.S. government’s plans of exiting North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and introducing a border-tax system have worsened prospects of auto stocks. This would increase the cost of U.S. cars and threaten jobs of thousands of suppliers.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    Honda Motor Co., Ltd.

1708,HOG,"Monday, July 2, 2018Pre-market futures are once again in the red this morning, in a holiday-shortened week that will be cleaved in half with Wednesday’s observance of Independence Day, when the U.S. shook off control of a hostile foreign power following passage of the most egalitarian governmental policy document in the history of the world, July 4, 1776 — a mere 242 years ago; a blink in the history of time.We “celebrate” the week of the 4th of July, not to mention the first trading day of the second half of the calendar year, re-stoking the fires of a global trade war, with President Trump over the weekend calling the European Union (EU) “worse than China” on trade with the U.S., and threatening a 20% tariff on imported foreign cars from Europe. This would effect companies like Daimler AG, which owns the Mercedes brand of vehicles. The EU, in return, has earmarked a total of $294 billion in U.S. goods imported to Europe if Trump goes after car imports.We’ve already seen how threats to EU imports have impacted companies like Harley-Davidson (HOG  -  Free Report) and Kentucky bourbon distributor Brown-Forman (BF.B  -  Free Report). This morning, Zacks Stock Strategist David Borun contemplates which corporate domino might be next to fall amid our current trade friction scenario: Harley-Davidson Reacts to EU Tariffs; Who’s Next?For Canada’s part, our neighbor to the north’s retaliatory measures are even more specific: while the country looks to charge 25% on imported U.S. steel and iron, a further 10% tax would be levied on consumer goods from tomato ketchup to coffee beans to dishwasher soap, totaling $12.6 billion in goods, total. This would have a negative effect on companies like Colgate-Palmolive (CL  -  Free Report) and Kraft Heinz (KHC  -  Free Report).Mexico has just elected a new president, leftist Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador (known as AMLO), so it remains to be seen how new leadership in the country will deal with Trump’s new trade tactics. Reportedly, the country has already targeted U.S. imports on items like Florida orange juice such as Minute Maid, owned by The Coca Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report).June PMI ManufacturingWe see some key manufacturing data for the month of June this morning after the opening bell: Project Management Institute (PMI) and Institute for Supply Management (ISM) results. The Markit Manufacturing PMI's previous month reported 54.6. ISM reports new results around 10am ET, along with new Construction spending for May. ISM is expected to come in at 58.3% for June following the 58.7% previously, whereas construction looks for break-even results after a +1.8% headline read in the prior month.Mark VickerySenior EditorQuestions or comments about this article and/or its author?

1709,HOG,"Iconic U.S. motorcycle manufacturer Harley-Davidson (HOG  -  Free Report) announced last Monday that it would shift some production out of the country to avoid newly enacted European Union tariffs on imports from the United States. Their plan is to manufacture motorcycles bound for the E.U. in facilities Harley already operates in Australia, India Thailand and Brazil. Exports from each of these countries to the E.U. will not be subject to the additional 25% tariffs – bringing the total to 31% - which would raise the price of an average Harley Davidson motorcycle $2,200, which the company says it cannot pass along to its dealers and customers without materially damaging sales.The most recent round of E.U. tariffs are a retaliation for trade penalties imposed by the Trump administration.The company estimates that the total incremental cost of the tariffs will be $30 to $45 million for the rest of 2018 and $90 to $100 million on a full-year basis. Net Income in 2017 at Harley Davidson was $522M, so the tariffs would have a significant impact on the bottom line.HOG shares sold off more than 6% on the news and are currently trading 25% lower than the 52-week high reached in January. Standard and Poor’s warned last Wednesday of a possible downgrade in the company’s credit rating due to near-term cost increases as a result of the E.U. tariffs.Harley’s U.S. sales were off more than 8% in 2017, while sales in the E.U. were steady - making it an important market for the quintessentially American brand. The transition is expected to take 9 to 18 months to complete. Manufacturing of motorcycles for domestic sale will remain in the U.S.In an 8-K disclosure to the S.E.C. – required in the case of an “unscheduled material event” – Harley specifically declares that the move is solely intended to avoid the impact of the tariffs, which went into effect on June 22nd.The company stated:Harley-Davidson maintains a strong commitment to U.S.-based manufacturing which is valued by riders globally. Increasing international production to alleviate the EU tariff burden is not the company’s preference, but represents the only sustainable option to make its motorcycles accessible to customers in the EU and maintain a viable business in Europe. Europe is a critical market for Harley Davidson. In 2017, nearly 40,000 riders bought new Harley-Davidson motorcycles in Europe, and the revenue generated from the EU countries is second only to the U.S.Pushback from the Chief ExecutivePresident Trump quickly responded to the news with a series of tweets critical of Harley’s intentions to move more production offshore.It’s unclear what exact retaliatory measures the president could actually take against Harley Davidson and it would be logistically difficult – and possibly not even legal – to implement additional taxes on a single company, but the message was loud and clear. Trump wants manufacturing to stay in the U.S. and will use any means available to make it so.Speaking at the groundbreaking ceremony for a massive new production facility in Wisconsin for Taiwanese electronics manufacturer Foxconn, Trump continued to criticize Harley’s plan to shift production offshore, saying, “Harley-Davidson, please build those beautiful motorcycles in the United States,” adding, “don’t get cute with us. Build them in the U.S.A, your customers won’t be happy if you don’t.”Widespread Trade War UncertaintyManagement at public companies has a responsibility to shareholders to do everything possible within the law to maximize profits. While not every company produces everything they make in the cheapest possible environment – it can certainly be an important image or marketing decision to be “made in the U.S.A.” even if it costs more – in general, decisions have to be made that best support the bottom line.With regard to taxes, multi-national corporations routinely manage activity across multiple jurisdictions to minimize taxes paid. Though occasionally referred to as “Un-American” to shift tax burden to countries with lower rates, it would actually be irresponsible of management not to do so – a waste of shareholder resources. The recent corporate tax cuts in the U.S. were largely an attempt to level the playing field and included incentives to repatriate profits held in other countries.Often management from the CEO down can’t know with certainty what the effects of taxes and other factors will be on future earnings and have to make an educated guess about how best to adapt to anticipated policy decisions. As we saw with the Harley-Davidson production shift, large-scale changes can take months or years to implement, during which time conditions can change dramatically.The current situation is extremely challenging for executives who are forced to make large-scale decisions based on hastily enacted tariffs and speculation about future retaliatory actions. Motorcycles are only two items out of more than 200 products affected by the recent 25% E.U. tariffs, including 71 agricultural and tobacco products and 85 varieties of raw and processed steel, as well as appliances, boats, Bourbon whiskey, and assorted household items – including playing cards, which inexplicably are subject to only a 10% import tariff.Incidentally, Zacks Chief Strategist and Phd Economist John Blank believes that defecit spending is the real culprit behind trade defecits - rather than trade deals or tariffs - and he has the math to back it up.Read John Blank's article here>>Which Industries Will Move NextU.S. tariffs on imported steel will affect roughly 6.4 billion Euros worth of imports from the E.U. The retaliatory tariffs are intended to be a direct response, with the first round affecting 2.8 billion Euros of American goods and the remaining 3.6 billion to come later. A release from the European commission states:The EU will rebalance bilateral trade with the US taking as a basis the value of its steel and aluminium exports affected by the US measures. Those are worth €6.4 billion. Of this amount, the EU will rebalance on €2.8 billion worth of exports immediately. The remaining rebalancing on trade valued at €3.6 billion will take place at a later stage – in three years' time or after a positive finding in WTO dispute settlement if that should come sooner.The EU rebalancing measures will be effective for as long as the US measures are in place, in line with the WTO Safeguards Agreement and EU legislation.It has been speculated that the initial list of goods subject to tariffs was chosen specifically to target industries in areas of the U.S. that supported President Trump in the 2016 elections and a quick glance at the list does seem to support that theory.It’s also been conjectured that the addition of Playing Cards - at the end of the list and with a smaller percentage tariff than everything else - was a tongue-in-cheek joke meant to signify that the E.U. is “playing the hand it’s been dealt.”When considering whether other American companies might follow Harley-Davidson’s lead and shift production to other countries, it quickly becomes obvious that most of the other industries would be unable to make a similar move. Agricultural producers simply cannot relocate at all – you can’t move a farm – and steel foundries are considerably less portable than factories assembling finished goods like motorcycles.The only remaining industries that could possibly shift some production out of the U.S. are appliances and boats. It’s unclear whether any U.S. manufacturers have the capability to easily shift the site of production the way Harley could because of its existing operations. Building or purchasing new facilities in reaction to tariffs that might be temporary would be a foolish expenditure. The news-headline value of these moves would also likely be just a fraction of the attention that’s already been paid to Harley’s move, which was exacerbated by the president’s reaction.It’s also not possible to know which goods might be on the E.U.’s second list if the trade war continues and the other tariff shoe drops.ConclusionSo Harley-Davidson seems to be uniquely unlucky to have been singled out both by the E.U. tariffs and also president Trump’s displeased reaction to their otherwise rational strategy. They are essentially between a rock and a hard place.It’s often said that “Nobody wins a trade war” and that certainly seems to be true, but some companies lose much more than others and unfortunately for Harley-Davidson, that list includes them.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest Strategies  It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

1710,HOG,"Harley-Davidson, Inc. (HOG  -  Free Report) recently announced that it will shift some of its production out of the United States to avoid EU (European Union) tariffs. The automaker’s decision came after Trump’s announcement of imposing tariffs on steel and aluminum, imported from the EU. In retaliation, the EU levied tariffs on U.S. goods, including motorcycles.Understandably, this tariff war has raised concerns among automakers. In fact, not only the automakers but the overall auto sector — including auto manufacturers, dealers, and auto parts and transportation companies — will be hit.Other than tariff-induced activities, the week saw Toyota Motor Corporation’s (TM  -  Free Report) luxury brand, Lexus, making the announcement to recall around 121,000 cars to fix fuel leaks that can cause a fire. Also, the week witnessed Ford Motor Company (F  -  Free Report) inking a deal with China’s Internet search company, Baidu Inc. The companies will co-develop artificial intelligence and smart connectivity solutions for cars.(Read the previous roundup here: Auto Stock Roundup for Jun 21, 2018)Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    Harley-Davidson reported its plan to shift the manufacturing of its motorcycles in the United States — which are sold in European Union (EU) — to international facilities. The decision has been taken after the EU hiked import tariffs to 31% for products manufactured in the United States, effective Jun 22, 2018.The hike in import tariffs has been levied by the EU as a counter strike for raising tariffs on steel and aluminum exported from the EU to the United States.Harley-Davidson expects the increased tariffs to raise costs of up to $2,200 per average motorcycle if the company continues to ship motorcycles from the United States to the EU countries. Further, it has no plan to transfer the increased costs to wholesale or retail customers. Per the company, passing on the costs to dealers and retail customers might have a long-term negative impact on its business in the European region.Harley-Davidson will have to bear the rise in costs due to increased tariffs, which will result in incremental costs of roughly $30-$45 million for the rest of 2018. Moreover, as the company has to ramp up production at its international facilities, it has to make investments to upgrade facilities, which are expected to take at least 9-18 months to be fully ready.

The majority of the recalls include cars in the United States. This is a blow to the Japanese auto giant, which has already been grappling with several recall issues.According to Toyota, the fuel injection system, which is composed of diaphragm material, may harden over time, leading to a fuel leakage. The company has assured that the dealers are going to replace the fuel delivery pipe with a new one, which has improved parts, at no cost.Toyota is one of the leading automakers in the world, in terms of sales and production. In the past few years, the company has been recalling vehicles in large numbers. Recalls not only affect the company’s reputation adversely but also result in considerable expenses and lower vehicle resale value. In January 2018, Toyota announced a recall of 601,300 vehicles due to flawed Takata airbags. The recall comprised of Toyota and Lexus models. The latest case of recall includes certain 2006 through 2013 IS350 cars, 2010 through 2014 IS350C, and 2007 through 2011 GS350 and GS450h. All contain 3.5-liter V6 gasoline engines.

Except for Wolfsburg hub, facilities at Zwickau and Emden will also remain closed for a few days.A new Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicle Test Procedure (“WLTP”), which works on real-driving information, has found higher carbon dioxide emission readings in a few vehicles. The new readings have deferred official road certification for those vehicles and thus, sales.These delays have deterred the company to be on track with the production of some of its vehicle models at different hubs. Further, Volkswagen has witnessed a probable dip in sales due to stricter emission tests. Last week, Daimler AG blamed WLTP and trade wars for lowering its income guidance.

1711,HOG,"After the European Union (EU) announced that from Jun 22 import tariffs of more than $3.2 billion will be levied on a variety of American products, Trump retaliated with auto tariffs. On Jun 22, the American President threatened to levy a tariff of 20% on cars and other automobiles imported from EU countries.With the President giving warnings of raising import tariffs on foreign-made cars, the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, a trade group of mostly U.S. automobile manufacturers, shared its concerns. Auto Alliance warned that such high auto tariffs may eventually raise production costs, reduce car demand and result in high job loss.Auto Alliance Expects $45 Billion Auto Tariffs In a letter to the U.S. Department of Commerce, Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, also known as Auto Alliance said that a tariff of 20% will lead to “increased producer costs,” which in turn will raise overall car costs. Additionally, the trade group estimated that after new tariffs are placed, the average price of a car will increase to $5,800. It also anticipated that the auto industry may have to bear a total tax of $45 billion after tariff raise, following this development.In fact, the trade group in its letter cautioned that higher auto tariffs will be a drag for car sales and lead to “less tax receipts.” Auto Alliance added that a low level of car sales “will lead to fewer jobs,” which will affect numerous families and ultimately the entire economy.Meanwhile, the U.S. Commerce Department is investigating whether auto-imports are actually a big threat to the country’s security. If Commerce Department’s probe findings reveal that they are a national threat, Trump’s auto-tariff initiative will gain ground and will create tension for the U.S. automakers.Automakers Anticipate a Booming Auto-Related Trade WarIt has been months now that auto manufacturers have begun discussions with the Trump administration in an attempt to prevent a full-on trade war. Several major automakers of the U.S., in their letter to the U.S. Department of Commerce, showed their concerns of a possible decline in car sales and job losses following high tariffs. Further, they have used a report by the Peterson Institute for International Economics to highlight their worries.As per the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a private, non-profit research institution devoted to international economics, a 25% auto tariff will lead to “a 1.5 percent decline in production.” Additionally, the institution expects that around 195,000 domestic workers may lose their job for a period of one to three years or even higher. They added that in case other such countries retaliate with similar tariffs, about 624,000 U.S. workers will be rendered jobless.Given this scenario, companies related to the domestic auto industry will definitely suffer. Market leaders of the Zacks Domestic Auto Industry, General Motors Company (GM  -  Free Report) and Ford Motor Company (F  -  Free Report) are visibly at the receiving end. While General Motors holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), Ford Motor has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Other companies that could be affected by the new auto tariffs are PACCAR Inc (PCAR  -  Free Report), Tesla, Inc. (TSLA  -  Free Report) and Harley-Davidson, Inc. (HOG  -  Free Report).Summing UpUndoubtedly, the auto industry is going through a bad phase, following President Trump’s decision to impose a tariff of 20% on cars and other automobiles imported from other countries. The Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers clearly showed its concern over higher auto tariffs and expects a dip in auto sales and witness steep job loss. So, it can be concluded that Trump-imposed new auto tariffs are expected to dampen investor sentiment for auto stocks in the days to come.5 Medical Stocks to Buy NowZacks names 5 companies poised to ride a medical breakthrough that is targeting cures for leukemia, AIDS, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, and other conditions.New products in this field are already generating substantial revenue and even more wondrous treatments are in the pipeline.

1712,HOG,"Wall Street ended Monday on a disappointing note as all three major stock market indexes declined significantly. Investors’ apprehensions about a trade war between the United States and China as well as with European Union have shaken market confidence. President Trump’s protectionist policies against key trading allies of the United States have generated severe market volatility. Although, yesterday’s decline was broad-based, the technology sector suffered maximum brunt of it. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) closed at 24,252.80, declining 1.3% or 328.09 points. The S&P 500 Index (INX) also decreased 1.4% to close at 2,717.07. The Nasdaq Composite Index (IXIC) closed at 7,532.01, losing 2.1% or 160.81 points. A total of 7.74 billion shares were traded on Monday, higher than the last 20-session average of 7.32 billion shares. Decliners outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 3.29-to-1 ratio. On the Nasdaq, decliners had an edge over advancers by 3.24-to-1 ratio.  The CBOE VIX increased 25.9% to close at 17.33, its highest level in nearly a month.  How Did the Benchmarks Perform?The Dow shed 1.3%, its biggest one-day drop since May 29. The blue-chip index closed at its lowest level since May 4. Moreover, the Dow ended below its 200-day moving average, a psychological barrier to gauge its long-term momentum trends. This happened for the first time since June 2016. Notably, 26 of the 30-stocks index closed in the red while 4 traded in the green.The S&P 500 dropped 1.4%, its biggest daily decline since April 6. This was also the index’s lowest close since May 31. During yesterday’s trading, the benchmark index fell below its 50-day moving average. However, it recovered from there and finally closed above the technical barrier.The S&P 500’s decline was primarily led by 2.2% loss of the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR (XLY), 2.1% decrease of both Communication Services Select Sector SPDR (XLC) and Technology Select Sector SPDR (XLK) and 2% decline of Energy Select Sector SPDR (XLE). Notably, nine out of 11 sectors of the benchmark index ended in negative territory.Nasdaq Composite decreased 2.1%, reflecting the index’s second straight losing session and its biggest one-day percentage loss since Apr 6. Large-cap tech behemoths and semiconductor stocks suffered significantly which pushed the tech-heavy index in the negative territory. Global Trade War Fears Intensify Ongoing trade related conflicts between the United States and its major trading allies like China, European Union, Canada, Mexico, to name a few are worsening day by day. Trade conflict between the United States and China has heightened to a position that imposition of tariffs and retaliatory traffic may go up to $450 billion on either side. In addition, President Trump desire to restrict Chinese companies to invest in U.S. tech firms block technology export to China by any U.S. companies will further escalate the tensions.Moreover, Trump has indicated that United States may impose 20% tariffs on auto imports from the European Union (EU) as a retaliatory move of EU’s decision to impose tariffs on U.S. auto exports.Yesterday, stock price of motorcycle giant Harley-Davidson Inc. (HOG  -  Free Report) declined 5.8% after the announcement that the EU tariff on its motorcycles has been raised to 31% from 6%. The company plans to shift production of EU-bound motorcycles to international facilities from U.S. facilities to avoid the tariff burden. Harley-Davidson carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Likewise, U.S. tech companies will not be allowed to export technology to China.On Monday, the technology sector suffered a severe blow as China is the most lucrative market for tech behemoths. U.S. tech giants operating in the fields of smartphone, software and Internet-based services, online video streaming and social networking generates a large chunk of their revenues from China. Moreover, China accounted for over 50% revenues for some of the leading semiconductors developers.China is sure to take retaliatory measures against U.S. restrictions which will significantly affect the business model of these large tech companies.

1713,HOG,"Harley-Davidson, Inc. (HOG  -  Free Report) reported its plan to shift the manufacturing of its motorcycles in the United States — which are sold in European Union (EU) — to international facilities. The decision has been taken after EU hiked import tariffs to 31% for products manufactured in the United States, effective Jun 22, 2018.The hike in import tariffs has been levied by EU as a counter strike for raising tariffs on steel and aluminum, exported from the EU to the United States.Harley-Davidson expects the increased tariffs to increase costs of up to $2,200 per average motorcycle if the company continues to ship motorcycles from the United States to the EU countries. Further, it has no plans to transfer the increased costs to wholesale or retail customers. Per the company, passing on the costs to dealers and retail customers might have a long-term negative impact on its business in the European region.Harley-Davidson will have to bear the rise in costs due to increased tariffs, which will result in incremental costs of roughly $30-$45 million for the rest of 2018. Moreover, as the company has to ramp up production at its international facilities, it has to make investments to upgrade facilities, which are expected to take at least 9-18 months to be fully ready.Harley-Davidson, Inc. Price and Consensus  Harley-Davidson, Inc. Price and Consensus | Harley-Davidson, Inc. QuoteExcept for the United States, the company has three assembly plants in Brazil, India and Thailand.In first-quarter 2018, Harley-Davidson’s international sales gained 0.2% to 21,777 motorcycles from 21,733 in the prior-year quarter, primarily driven by European sales.  Moreover, in full-year 2017, European countries were the second-highest contributor to the company’s revenues. Further, the company considers Europe as one of its critical markets. In order to overcome its declining demand in the U.S. markets, Harley-Davidson aims to improve its international reach and expects a boost of 50% in yearly volume by 2027.Price PerformanceOver a month, Harley-Davidson’s stock has moved down 1.8%, underperforming 6.5% increase of the industry it belongs to.  Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderCurrently, Harley-Davidson has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1714,HOG,"With fourth-quarter results getting released across all sectors, a few companies under the Auto sector have posted financial numbers. Two auto giants, Ford Motor Company (F  -  Free Report) and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCAU  -  Free Report), have already announced quarterly performance on Jan 25. While Ford’s earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate, Fiat Chrysler beat the same.Now, let’s evaluate how the four auto companies namely PACCAR Inc. (PCAR  -  Free Report), Harley-Davidson, Inc. (HOG  -  Free Report), CNH Industrial N.V. (CNHI  -  Free Report) and Autoliv, Inc. (ALV  -  Free Report) are placed ahead of reporting quarterly figures on Jan 30.Per the latest Earnings Outlook, 89 companies from the S&P 500 category have already announced fourth-quarter results as of Jan 24, registering earnings and revenue beat ratios of 80.9% and 74.2%, respectively.However, the auto sector’s bottom line in the to-be-reported quarter is expected to record 12% growth while the top line is likely to witness a 5.1% year-over-year decline. However, the S&P 500 companies are estimated to log a respective 10.8% and 7.3% year-over-year rise in earnings and revenues during the quarter.Automakers are closely observing a shift in their customer preferences. A change in the buying pattern of consumers has compelled automakers to reassess their strategies. Nowadays, the auto sector is focusing more on developing its line-up of pick-up trucks and crossovers.Now, let’s take a look at the four auto companies scheduled to announce results on Jan 30.We relied on the proven Zacks quantitative model, combining a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) with a positive Earnings ESP, to predict the chances of earnings beat this quarter. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Per our proprietary methodology, Earnings ESP shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Our research shows that with an ideal combination of the two key ingredients — Zacks Rank and ESP — chances of a positive surprise are as high as 70% for the stocks lined up for an earnings release.Headquartered in Bellevue, WA, PACCAR primarily engages in the designing and manufacturing of premium light, medium and heavy-duty trucks. Additionally, it develops and manufactures advanced diesel engines and distributes truck parts related to its primary business. Our model does not predict that the company is likely to beat on earnings this time around with an Earnings ESP of -1.34% and a Zacks Rank #3 as the combination leaves surprise prediction inconclusive.Last quarter, the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Per its impressive earnings history, the company beat estimates thrice and missed on a single count in the trailing four quarters with an average positive surprise of 1.48%. PACCAR has a long-term earnings growth rate of 10%. (Read more: What's in Store for PACCAR This Earnings Season?).PACCAR Inc. Price and EPS Surprise PACCAR Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | PACCAR Inc.

These companies as a whole, posted 79.6% growth in earnings and 72.2% rise in revenues, respectively.However, second-quarter 2017 earnings and revenue growth for auto companies is expected to be below par. The year-over-year growth in earnings and revenues for the auto stocks are expected to decline 7.5% and 5.6%, respectively. Also during the quarter, the S&P 500 companies are anticipated to record year-over-year growth of 11.9% and 5.5% in earnings and revenues, respectively.Recently, auto makers have been facing a lot of challenges, which in turn might hamper their performances in 2017. Also, the strong performance exhibited by the sector in 2016 (record year for new vehicle sales in the U.S.) is not likely to continue in 2017, as the industry is facing problems of high inventory levels and vehicle recalls.General Motors Company (GM  -  Free Report) lowered the U.S. sales outlook for new vehicle sales in 2017. This indicates that the industry might be heading toward an average downfall in 2017. A decline in new vehicle volume will also lead to a dip in company’s total sales.In addition, frequent safety recalls and related costs are burdening the financials of the auto manufacturers. A few companies, affected by these recalls are, Honda Motor Co., Ltd. (HMC  -  Free Report) and Toyota Motor Corporation (TM  -  Free Report).That said, let’s take a look at how these auto companies are placed ahead of their announcement.We relied on the Zacks methodology, combining a favorable Zacks Rank and a positive Earnings ESP, to predict the chances of a beat this quarter.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Per our proprietary methodology, the Earnings ESP shows a percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate.

1718,HOG,"After a record 2016, auto sales in the United States declined in 2017. This is the first time since the financial crisis that auto sales have declined from the previous-year figure. According to Autodata, in 2017, auto sales in the United States were 17.2 million, down from the prior-year figure of 17.85 million.

Dealing with consumers’ changing preference for pickup trucks and SUVs to passenger cars, would be a challenge for automakers. At the same time, higher interest rates, despite robust growth expectation, will continue to pose challenges for automakers in 2018.However, in the coming days, auto sales will depend not only on different conventional determinants such as the state of the economy and energy price, but also on various unprecedented factors, including the progress made in the electric and autonomous vehicle driving front.Auto Stocks: Some Silver LiningThere are a few positive signs for the auto stocks that are likely to give a boost to auto demand. Robust economic growth, improving employment conditions, reasonable gasoline prices, sturdy consumer confidence, and rising income and wages. Also, a slew of measures, including proposed tax cuts should provide some extra advantage to profits and sales.Also, some investors are bidding up the auto stocks under the notion that the high-margin pickup trucks and SUVs will pull automakers through any downturn.The upcoming earnings announcements are a key events for the sector, with investors looking for earnings and revenue growth. Earnings growth leads to price rise, indicating more gains and assets for the investors.The Zacks MethodologyIrrespective of the outlook of the auto sector, there are a few auto stocks which are likely to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the fourth quarter.Figuring out such prospective stocks could be quite tough unless one applies the proper method.

1719,HOG,"Last week saw major U.S. automakers coming up with December and 2017 auto sales. After a record 2016, U.S. auto sales declined in 2017. This is the first time since the financial crisis that auto sales have declined from that of prior-year figure. According to Autodata, in 2017, U.S. auto sales were 17.2 million, down from the prior-year figure of 17.85 million. Despite the decline, 2017 was a robust year for the auto industry as a whole.In December, domestic auto companies collectively reported lower U.S. sales. General Motors Company (GM  -  Free Report) and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V. (FCAU  -  Free Report) reported year-over-year sales decline in December, while Ford Motor Company (F  -  Free Report) reported sales increase.Also, major automakers project 2018 auto sales to remain weak. Dealing with consumers’ changing preference for pickup trucks and SUVs to passenger cars, would be a challenge for automakers. At the same time, higher interest rates, despite robust growth expectation, will continue to pose challenges for automakers in 2018.  (Read the previous roundup here: Auto Stock Roundup for Dec 28, 2017)Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, is examining if Ford’s recall cases can be extended to include additional vehicles. This has posed a challenge for the U.S. auto giant.Notably, in 2016, Ford recalled 153,000 vehicles because it feared that drivers could lose control of the vehicle due to unexpected shift of the automatic transmissions into first gear. The recalls included F-150 pickups, Ford Expedition and Lincoln Navigator SUVs and Ford Mustang sports cars between 2011 and 2012 model years.Currently, the Federal safety officials are investigating if Ford should have included more than a million additional vehicles, including F-150s, Navigators and Expeditions from the 2011, 2012 and 2013 model years.In December 2017, Ford announced that it is in the process of issuing two safety recalls and two safety compliance recalls in North America. In October 2017, the company announced that it would recall 1.34 million units of 2015-17 Ford F-150 and 2017 Ford Super Duty trucks in North America to add water shields to side door latches in the trucks (read more: Ford's 2016 Recalls Under Federal Safety Officials Scrutiny).Currently Ford has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

As of that date, 10% companies from the Auto sector have reported earnings for the quarter ended Sep 30, 2017.However, third-quarter 2017 earnings and revenue growth for auto companies are expected to be in the negative territory. Auto stocks are expected to register 17.4% and 5.6% year-over-year decline in earnings and revenues, respectively. However, the S&P 500 companies are expected to register 3% and 4.9% year-over-year growth in earnings and revenues, respectively, during the quarter.Automakers are witnessing a radical shift in their operations. The speed at which consumers’ preference pattern is changing, has prodded a number of automakers to reassess their strategies. Added to this is the compulsion of manufacturing electric and green cars, which are likely to bring in numerous changes in the industry.Let’s take a look at the three auto companies scheduled to announce their results tomorrow.We relied on the Zacks methodology, combining a favorable Zacks Rank – Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) – and a positive Earnings ESP, to predict the chances of a beat this quarter.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Per our proprietary methodology, Earnings ESP shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate.

Our model predicts that the company is likely to deliver a positive surprise as it currently has an Earnings ESP of +3.14% and a Zacks Rank #3.General Motors has a positive outlook for 2017, mainly driven by robust retail crossover sales. In September 2017, the company’s total U.S. vehicles sales increased 11.9% year over year. In August, too, the auto giant’s total U.S. sales rose 7.5%.

1723,HOG,"Good news is here, investing friends! Q3 earnings results are not only clear and present, but results are better than expected among most household name stocks ahead of the bell this morning. In a quarter rife with stresses from the nation’s capital, natural disasters both here and abroad, and other stock market headwinds, stronger-than-expected earnings are providing a good tonic for us this morning.Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report) tore the cover off the ball, figuratively speaking. The Wall Street investment giant easily surpassed top and bottom-line estimates: $5.02 per share beat the $4.31 expected, and revenues of $8.3 billion topped the $7.6 billion in the Zacks consensus estimate. This was also higher than the $8.2 billion recorded in the year-ago quarter. This marks the fourth quarter in the last five that Goldman Sachs has beaten earnings estimates, for a 4-quarter trailing average of 11.6%.Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) also beat expectations for both earnings and revenues: the investment bank’s top line brought in $9.2 billion, versus the $9.0 billion expected, on earnings per share of 93 cents — easily outpacing the 81 cents anticipated. Investment banking revenues, in particular, grew 18.4% in the company’s Q3.Household products giant Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) beat earnings estimates by a solid dime to $1.90 per share, as top-line results also came in above expectations: $19.65 billion versus $19.28 billion in the Zacks consensus. Guidance for fiscal 2017 was also raised. Pharma sales in the quarter grew an impressive 15.4%.For its fifth straight earnings beat (at least), United Healthcare (UNH  -  Free Report) also posted a positive surprise ahead of today’s opening bell: $2.66 per share bested the $2.57 expected. Revenues of $50.3 billion in the quarter rose 8.7% year over year on growth in medical enrollment.On the other side of the street, Harley Davidson (HOG  -  Free Report) illustrated some of the difficulties in today’s market, just meeting the 40 cents per share expected in the Zacks consensus, down 40% from year-ago results. Sales of $962.1 million did top the $960.8 million expected, but these numbers are both down from the $1.1 billion reported in Q3 2016. Baby boomers buying fewer bikes looks to be the culprit here; in related news, Peter Fonda is 77 years old.New Import/Export NumbersSeptember results for both import and export prices beat expectations this morning, up 0.7% last month from the 0.6% consensus, as well as the unrevised headline from the previous month. Exports performed even better, up 0.8% as opposed to the +0.5% expected. Imports year over year are in-line at +1.9%, while exports are +2.7% since this time last year. More grist for the interest rate hike mill. You know the Fed is paying attention to this.

1725,HOG,"The first-quarter earnings season is in full swing. A few automakers have already released their earnings while a majority of them will release theirs in the next few days. On Apr 24, PACCAR Inc. (PCAR  -  Free Report) and Harley-Davidson Inc. (HOG  -  Free Report) reported first-quarter earnings. Both the companies reported earnings beat for the quarter.Per the latest Earnings Preview, 87 companies from the S&P 500 category have already announced first-quarter results as of Apr 20, registering earnings and revenue beat ratios of 82.8% and 67.8%, respectively.However, on a year-over-year basis, the auto sector’s bottom line in the to-be-reported quarter is expected to record a decline of 9.6% while the top line is likely to fall 3.4%. However, the S&P 500 companies are estimated to record respective 18.3% and 7.7% year-over-year rise in earnings and revenues during the quarter.An improved economy and shift in consumer preferences toward trucks and sports utility vehicles (SUV) encouraged automakers to launch new models in the U.S. market with an aim to earn their share of profit. In Europe, automakers are witnessing a decline in vehicle sales. Per European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association, vehicle registrations edged down 0.6% in first-quarter 2018. This decline is majorly due to slowing economic growth and uncertain trading regulations, once U.K. pulls itself out of European Union.Now, let’s evaluate how the four auto companies namely General Motors Company (GM  -  Free Report), BorgWarner Inc. (BWA  -  Free Report), LKQ Corporation (LKQ  -  Free Report) and Lear Corporation (LEA  -  Free Report) are placed ahead of reporting quarterly figures on Apr 26.We relied on the proven Zacks quantitative model, combining a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) with a positive Earnings ESP, to predict the chances of earnings beat this quarter.

Its products range from electric cars to heavy-duty full-size trucks. The company offers products under eight distinctive automotive brands namely, Chevrolet, Buick, GMC, Cadillac, Holden, Baojun, Wuling, and Jiefang. Our model does not predict that the company, with an Earnings ESP of -2.21% and a Zacks Rank #3, is likely to beat on earnings as the combination leaves surprise prediction inconclusive.In the last reported quarter, the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. It also beat estimates in the trailing four quarters with an average positive surprise of 18.4%. General Motors has long-term earnings growth rate of 8.4%.

1727,HOG,"Monday, June 25, 2018This week looks to be an important one for housing metrics, with New Homes Sales totals being released after the bell today, the Case-Shiller home price index hitting the tape tomorrow, and Pending Home Sales Wednesday. For this morning, however, we once again look toward increased pressure in the burgeoning “trade war” with China, and market futures are back in the red this pre-market.President Trump now looks to curb Chinese investment in American companies, or more specifically firms with 25% Chinese ownership. This would include limits on Chinese investment in U.S. companies with “industrially significant technology.” Sectors featuring “Made in China 2025” companies would be targeted, and this new policy could take effect one month from now.This new reveal looks to get tougher on specific business affected by past trade policies between the U.S. and China, whereby we have endured injustices such as theft of intellectual property (IP) at the hands of Chinese firms looking to beat copyright restrictions in U.S. law. The already imposed steel and aluminum tariffs against most of our trading partners, including Mexico, Canada and the EU, cut a much wider swath of the global trade fabric, and what worries many analysts are the scenarios in which countries like China begin to work in strategic alignment with these countries against U.S. interests.While major domestic indexes are indeed down in today’s pre-trading — especially the Dow, which aside from Friday’s close in positive territory, looks to see its 9th down day in the last 10 sessions — we also see more than 1% drops in the Hang Seng and Shanghai indexes from overnight. So while we rightly remain focused on challenges here at home, perhaps there is some comfort to be derived from Chinese investors having a hard time with new bilateral trade policies as well.Aside from market activity, which reliably provides a forward outlook in the U.S. economy about eight or nine months, do we see any direct impact domestically as a result of these trade tensions? Actually, we do: with targeted tariffs on American-made motorcycles, Milwaukee, WI-based Harley-Davidson (HOG  -  Free Report) foresees costs from these tariffs amounting to $100 million a year. As a result, the company now looks to take at least part of its manufacturing overseas.This wouldn’t be the first time Harley has come to this decision in 2018, either. When the company closed its Kansas City plant this past winter, it cost the company 800 domestic jobs. Importantly, this decision was made well before trade tariffs but following the windfall corporate tax cuts passed by Congress late last year. These jobs were reportedly outsourced to a new motorcycle plant in Thailand, and further cost savings for manufacturing now that tariffs on Harley products are a reality might be made by relocating additional workforce to the same plant.Mark VickerySenior EditorQuestions or comments about this article and/or its author?

1728,HOG,"U.S. customers have recently shown a distinct shift in the preference for trucks and sports utility vehicles (SUVs), shunning the traditional sedans. Automakers have already started to reorient their programs and strategies in response to the new situation, where the demand for conventional compact and midsize cars has declined while increased for SUVs and pickup trucks.The recent decision of General Motors Company (GM  -  Free Report) to abandon three Cadillac sedans and replacing them with two new ones over the next three and a half years vindicates this trend. In 2012, shares of traditional passenger cars were more than 50% of new-vehicle sales in the United States but, it dropped to less than 37% in 2017.In addition to General Motors’ decision to dump the sedans, the week also saw other important developments. Two auto giants, Ford Motor Company (F  -  Free Report) and Volkswagen AG (VLKAY  -  Free Report) are exploring an alliance on a wide range of activities, including the development of commercial vehicles. In the past week, Winnebago Industries Inc. (WGO  -  Free Report) reported strong earnings results, surpassing both the Zacks Consensus Estimate as well as the prior-year quarter figure.(Read the previous roundup here: Auto Stock Roundup for Jun 14, 2018)Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    Per Associated Press, General Motors is dumping three Cadillac sedans and replacing them with two new ones over the next three and a half years. This auto giant has announced that it is going to invest $175 million to update a plant in Lansing, MI, to manufacture replacement models for ATS compact, CTS midsize and XTS full-size cars.Sedan models have struggled in the United States market as consumers are increasingly abandoning those in favor of larger, spacious SUVs and pickup trucks. In 2012, shares of traditional passenger cars were more than 50% of new-vehicle sales in the United States but, it dropped to less than 37% in 2017. In 2017, ATS sales declined 39% while CTS and XTS sales dropped 35% and 27%, respectively.The new cars will enter the market by the end of 2021 and further details would be released later. However, there will be no change in the workforce of the Lansing Grand River factory.

The alliance would aid both the companies to compete effectively in the global market, which is increasingly demanding high-tech and efficient lower-emission vehicles.Thomas Sedran, the head of the German automaker Volkswagen’s strategy division, noted that the two companies have “strong and complementary positions in different commercial vehicle segments already.” Moreover, the U.S. auto giant, Ford is a dominant player in the medium-duty truck market in the United States and its F-series pickup has been the best-selling vehicle in the country for decades. On the other hand, Volkswagen, which owns MAN and Scania truck brands in Europe, formed a commercial-vehicle alliance with the Japanese truckmaker, Hino Motors Ltd in early 2018.In order to adapt to the challenging environment, it is important to explore alliances. In fact, several automakers have collaborated on various big projects. This particular alliance discussion is an addition to this trend.

Gross profit improved to $85.5 million, increasing from $70.8 million a year ago.

Subject to approval from regulatory authorities, both the companies will team up to develop hydrogen vehicle technology to facilitate volume production in a quicker and efficient way.Further, in order to develop this sustainable energy solution, both the companies are exploring other extensive collaborations. Under this collaboration, the two companies can share non-competitive components and access each other's intellectual property to develop fuel cells for vehicles.For Volkswagen Group, world's largest auto seller, Audi is responsible for developing hydrogen fuel-cell technology. Per its strategy for fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs), Audi is collaborating with companies to develop this sustainable technology at lucrative costs.The capacity to cover longer distances and a shorter recharge time make hydrogen an attractive alternative energy option for electric mobility, specifically for large and heavy automobiles, due to FCEV's design.

1729,HOG,"On Jun 20, the European Union (EU) announced that starting Jun 22, import tariffs of 2.8 billion euros or more than $3.2 billion will be levied on a variety of American products. The “tit-for-tat” levies came into action after the United States slapped tariffs of 25% on steel imports and 10% on aluminum imports from EU countries.Trump signed the tariff plan into law on Mar 8, levying charges on steel and aluminum imports from other countries. Trump’s metal tariffs initially exempted neighbors Canada and Mexico, and the EU. But, on Jun 1, when the United States levied metal tariffs on the EU, citing “national security,” the EU did not shy away from taking such ""rebalancing measures.”New Set of EU Tariffs Fan Trade War FearsOn Jun 20, the European Commission said that a tariff of at least $3.2 billion will be imposed on imports starting this Friday (Jun 22). Earlier in June, when the United States imposed steel and aluminum tariffs on the EU, the economic bloc gave enough hints of strong retaliation to this action. In fact, Maroš Šefcovic, Vice-President of the European Commission reportedly called the U.S. tariff decision “unilateral and illegal.”After Wednesday’s decision to charge import tariffs of 25% on different U.S. goods, Cecilia Malmström, trade commissioner of the EU, said that the rules of global trade “cannot be violated without a reaction” from the EU. She added that the EU’s response to Trump administration import duties is “measured, proportionate and fully in line with WTO rules."" Malmström also said that if “U.S. removes its tariffs,” the EU will follow suit.According to Export.gov, an International Trade Administration initiative, the EU’s average tariff charged on American products is 3%. However, after Jun 22, an import tax of a whopping 25% will be charged on all these products. Additionally, the EU threatened to levy tariff of further 3.6 billion euros or around $4.2 billion “in three years' time” or before provided something positive comes up in the “WTO dispute settlement.”Stocks at the Receiving End of EU TariffsThe EU decided to levy tariffs on U.S. goods after President Trump threatened a fresh set of tariffs of $450 billion on goods imported from China. The ongoing trade war between the United States with China and now the EU is clearly a sign of worry for global trade.In fact, a wide variety of American product types, including agricultural products like bourbon whiskey and peanut butter, steel giants and jeans companies will be impacted by this new set of EU import tariffs. Bourbon whiskey companies like Elijah Craig and Blanton’s, and The J. M. Smucker (SJM  -  Free Report), one of the key players in peanut butter industry will bear the trouble.Moreover, trade tensions between Washington and Brussels might be affecting motor-bike manufacturer, Harley-Davidson (HOG  -  Free Report). European auto-giants like Daimler (DDAIF  -  Free Report), BMW BMWYY and Volkswagen (VLKAY  -  Free Report) will also suffer as some of their biggest production plants are in the United States. Negotiations are underway to abolish auto tariffs between the United States and the EU.Other companies to be affected by the new EU tariffs are jeans company Levi Strauss and steel manufacturers, United States Steel (X  -  Free Report) and Steel Dynamics (STLD  -  Free Report). While United States Steel has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), Steel Dynamics holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Summing UpUndoubtedly, the EU tariff announcement has added to the already intensifying trade war. The EU is gearing up to levy import tariffs on a number of American goods including motorbikes, jeans, bourbon whiskey and peanut butter. The U.S.-China trade war and rising tariff-related tensions between the United States and the European Union are expected to dampen investor sentiment in the days to come.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

Price and Consensus | Harley-Davidson, Inc. QuoteFactors Influencing This QuarterHarley-Davidson continues to expect stiff competition, which may hurt its retail sales as competitors rely on discounts and product introductions to boost the same. The weak demand in Asia Pacific is expected to contunue through the second half of 2017.

In the previous quarter, the segment’s operating income declined 6.6% year over year.Harley-Davidson will be paying $15 million as settlement charges to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) due to its “super tuners” releasing harmful emissions despite bolstering power. Of the total amount, $3 million will be spent to replace conventional woodstoves with cleaner-burning in the faulty models to mitigate air pollution.

The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-quarter’s earnings being revised 2.4% downward over the last 30 days to 41 cents per share.Let us see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Harley-Davidson, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Harley-Davidson, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Harley-Davidson, Inc. QuoteFactors Influencing This QuarterIn the third quarter of 2017, the motor company expects to dispatch around 39,000-44,000 motorcycles, representing a decline of 10-20% from the year-ago period. Also, stiff competition and huge price discounting might hit Harley-Davidson’s retail sales.Additionally, Harley-Davidson will be paying $15 million as settlement charges to the Environmental Protection Agency due to its super tuners releasing harmful emissions despite power generation. Of the total amount, a whopping $12 million will be paid as civil penalty. Per the deal, the company will also buy back all the devices and discontinue future sales of the product. These actions will further add to its expenses.However, in order to increase its customer base, Harley-Davidson focuses on expanding product portfolio and making long-term investments. The company aims to launch 100 new motorcycle models by 2027. Further, to improve the international reach, it has been adding new dealerships with a target of clinching 150 to 200 new global contracts by 2020. With these initiatives, the company expects to achieve positive growth in overseas retail sales in the second half of 2017.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Harley-Davidson is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here, as you will see below:Zacks ESP: Harley-Davidson has an Earnings ESP of -4.45% as the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at 39 cents, lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 41 cents. A positive ESP on the other hand, serves as an indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Harley-Davidson currently carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP and chances of an earnings beat. However, combined with a negative Earnings ESP, surprise prediction becomes inconclusive.Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revision.Price PerformanceShares of Harley-Davidson have declined 20.3% year to date, substantially underperforming the industry’s 26.7% rally.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some stocks worth considering from the Auto industry as per our model, these have the right combination of elements to beat estimates this quarter:Magna International, Inc.

1740,HOG,"The European Union (EU) has threatened the United States of a tit-for-tat situation should Trump impose a 25% tax on foreign steel. This is especially true as the EU would propose a retaliatory tariff of 25% on a range of consumer, agricultural and steel products imported from the country, valued about 2.8 billion euros ($3.5 billion).The targeted products include shirts, jeans, cosmetics, other consumer goods, motorbikes and pleasure boats worth around 1 billion euros; orange juice, bourbon whiskey, corn and other agricultural products totaling 951 million euros; and steel and other industrial products valued at 854 million euros.In a counter-attack, Trump warned the EU that he would impose a 25% penalty on European car imports if the bloc carried out punitive measures against the metals tariffs. He reiterated his commitment to levying tariffs on steel and aluminum, saying that the United States has poor trading conditions with other nations, including those in the EU. According to the latest data from the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (ACEA), EU and U.S. auto-related trade account for around 10% of total trade between the two regions (read: Trump Tariffs Put These Sector ETFs & Stocks in Focus).Intensifying talks of a trade war between Trump and the EU have been unnerving investors lately, putting many stocks and ETFs in focus. Here, we have discussed some.What’s HotThe penalty on European car imports could spell trouble for popular car manufacturers like Volkswagen and BMW, affecting the German auto industry. These luxury carmakers also manufacture cars in America, shipping billions of dollars abroad. According to Germany's Association of the Automotive Industry, this country produced 854,000 vehicles in the United States in 2016, marking a four-fold increase in about seven years. More than 60% of those were exported.As such, iShares MSCI Germany ETF (EWG  -  Free Report) targeting the German stock market, will likely feel the pressure. The ETF has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) with a Medium risk outlook (read: ETFs to Buy as German Economy Grows).Coming to the EU proposed retaliation against U.S. goods, manufacturer and seller of motorcycles Harley Davidson (HOG  -  Free Report) will be hit hard as about 16% of the company’s sales come from Europe. The company cautioned that the tariffs “will drive up costs for all products with these raw materials, regardless of their origin.” It also stated “a punitive, retaliatory tariff on Harley-Davidson motorcycles in any market would have a significant impact on their sales, their dealers, suppliers and the customers in those markets.” The stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and a VGM Score of D.Harley Davidson accounts for a minor 1.5% share in the only pure play auto ETF — First Trust NASDAQ Global Auto ETF (CARZ  -  Free Report) (read: Should You Steer Clear of Auto ETFs & Stocks?).Other iconic American brands that will be hurt include Levi Strauss & Co, the corporate parent of global market-share leader Levi's, and bourbon whiskey. Notably, Europe has been a major contributor to Levi’s sales, with 20% increase in jeans sales last year.Meanwhile, the additional tax on bourbon whiskey will make the product more expensive, hurting sales of the likes of Brown Forman Corporation’s  Jack Daniel's family of whiskey, Diageo’s (DEO  -  Free Report) Bulleit Bourbon Whiskey and Constellation Brands’s (STZ  -  Free Report) Black Velvet. The three stocks have a Zacks Rank #3.This would negatively impact the performance of the Spirited Funds/ETFMG Whiskey and Spirits ETF  targeting the fast-growing world of high-end whiskey and spirits. In fact, it has heavy exposure to Diageo, which dominates the fund’s return with 16.6% of total assets.Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.

Such gains were made possible after investors believed risks associated with a possible trade war were overblown. Instead, they chose to focus on encouraging ISM Services Index data. Investors also keenly followed the progress of elections in Germany and Italy.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) increased 1.4% to close at 24,874.76. The S&P 500 gained 1.1% to close at 2,720.94. The tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index closed at 7,330.70, increasing 1%. The fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) decreased 7.3% to close at 18.17. A total of 6.91 billion shares were traded on Monday, considerably lower than the last 20-session average of 8.3 billion shares. Advancers outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by a 2.82-to-1 ratio. On Nasdaq, a 2.20-to-1 ratio favored advancing issues.How did Benchmarks Fare?The Dow amassed a whopping 336.7 points, erasing losses it incurred earlier in the session, to end the day in the green. Gains for the blue-chip index were supported by a 3.2% surge in the shares of Caterpillar (CAT  -  Free Report).The S&P 500 added 29.7 points to also end in the positive territory. All of the 11 major segments of the S&P 500 ended in the green, with utilities and real estate shares leading the gainers. The Utilities Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLU) and Real Estate Select Sector SPDR (XLRE) gained 2% and 1.4%, respectively.Gains for the broader index were also supported by a surge in shares of Harley-Davidson, Inc. (HOG  -  Free Report), which gained 2.3% in intraday trade. Meanwhile, the EU has said that it will impose tariffs on classic American products such as bourbon, jeans and Harley motorcycle, but doesn’t seem keen on further measures at this point. This further led the investors to believe that such issues are rather overblown. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq rose 72.8 points to end in the green. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Investors Look beyond Trade War FearsOn Friday, Trump said that the U.S. will impose a 25% tariff on steel imports and a 10% tariff on aluminum. Such protectionist trade measures triggered a lot of concern among corporations and consumers. Tariffs will increase the cost of companies that rely heavily on aluminum and steel, like auto and plane makers.Trump’s contentious tariff announcement raised apprehensions about retaliation from China and other major U.S. trading partners. China cautioned America to abide by multilateral trade rules and not to harm the delicate global economy.Such announcements also invited flak from global leaders, with the European Union saying that they would impose tariffs on $3.5 billion worth of U.S. imports, as per Reuters. Trump retaliated by warning the European Union of dire consequences if it objected to the new tariffs. In the event of an objection from EU, Trump threatened to impose a new set of tariffs on European autos.Trump also tweeted over the weekend that the United States is losing on every trade deal it is currently a part of. He further stated in his tweet, “Our friends and enemies have taken advantage of the U.S. for many years. Our Steel and Aluminum industries are dead.”Meanwhile, a Chinese government official stated that China was thinking to soon restart discussions with United States regarding trade disputes. However, possibility of such a discussion was negated by a spokesperson from White House, who stated that there were no plans for such a meeting. However, such developments did not have much of an impact on the markets as the investors played down possible threats of a trade war.Elections in EuropeInvestors keenly followed the results of elections in Italy which yielded no clear winner. What baffled investors even further was the fact that anti-EU and euro-skeptic political parties performed far better than initial forecasts.Meanwhile, in Germany, Angela Merkel won her fourth term as Chancellor even as the Social Democratic Party of Germany agreed to form a coalition in a bid to end the political instability that had gripped the country recently. This is likely to be Merkel’s last term as Chancellor.Economic DataThe Institute of Supply Management (ISM) reported that its ISM Services Index decreased from 59.9% in January to 59.5% in February. However, the index came in considerably higher than the consensus estimate of 58.4%. U.S. service sector activity has now expanded for ninety seven consecutive months on the back of a strong upside in business activity and new orders.Stocks That Made HeadlinesCEO Change at Canadian National: Recovery in the Cards?In a bid to revive its sagging fortunes, railroad operator Canadian National Railway Company (CNI  -  Free Report) announced a change at its helm.

1742,HOG,"A series of recalls continues to cast a pall over automakers around the globe. The latest recall involved Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V. (FCAU  -  Free Report). The automaker announced the recall of more than 5.3 million vehicles from North America to repair a defective cruise control. The recall includes gasoline-based combustion engine vehicles with model years between 2014 and 2019.Moreover, the week saw Tesla, Inc. (TSLA  -  Free Report) extending the launch of Model 3 at overseas markets to the next year. The company’s CEO, Elon Musk informed that the left-hand drive of Model 3 will be rolled out in the first half of 2019 in Asia and Europe, though the company initially planned to release it in the later-half of 2018.The Japanese automaker Toyota Motor Corp. (TM  -  Free Report) announced plans to raise the production of hydrogen-powered vehicles at its two facilities. The move is in line with its projection, stating global sales of fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEV) will increase to at least 30,000 units per year after 2020.(Read the previous roundup here: Auto Stock Roundup for May 24, 2018)Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    Toyota announced plans to ramp up the production of hydrogen-powered vehicles at its two facilities. One of the two facilities will manufacture hydrogen fuel stack mass while a new line will be added to an existing facility for producing high-pressure hydrogen tanks. The decision is in line with Toyota’s projection that global sales of FCEV will increase to at least 30,000 units per year after 2020. At present, the figure is 3,000 units per year.In order to increase fuel cell stack production, the facility will be shifted from its existing location to Honsha Plant in Toyota City. Further, the production of high-pressure hydrogen tanks will be handled by its Shimoyama Plant in Miyoshi City. Production at new sites will begin around 2020.In December 2014, the company introduced its mass-produced fuel-cell sedan, Mirai. Due to high manufacturing costs and difficulty in building its components, Mirai was initially manufactured in small lots. Gradually, the annual production and sales increased from around 700 units in 2015 to roughly 2,000 units in 2016.

In unusual situations, the defect might prevent drivers from deactivating the vehicle’s cruise control. The device usually helps drivers to retain a constant speed without intervention.Further, the company has warned owners not to use the faulty function before the software gets updated in their vehicles.Out of the recalled vehicles, more than 4.8 million are from the United States while 490,000 are from Canada. The recall includes gasoline-based combustion engine vehicles with model years between 2014 and 2019. The vehicles include Chrysler 200, Chrysler 300, Chrysler Pacifica, Dodge Charger, Dodge Challenger, Dodge Journey, Jeep Grand Cherokee, Jeep Wrangler, and Ram 1500, 2500 and 3500 pickup trucks, Dodge Durango, Jeep Cherokee, and Ram 3500/4500/5500 cab chassis trucks. Owners of the affected vehicles will be informed this week and the repairs will be done free of cost. (Read more: Fiat Chrysler to Recall 5.3M Units in North America)Fiat Chrysler currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).3.    Volkswagen AG (VLKAY  -  Free Report) anticipates reaching its target of selling one million electric vehicles (EVs) by 2025, per Reuters. Strong demand from China and Europe, and untapped potential in the southern hemisphere are behind this positive expectation.Notably, after being severely affected by the emissions scandal in 2015, this German auto giant set an ambitious plan to emerge as the world leader in green transport. By 2025, the company intends to deliver one million VW-brand EVs every year. This strategy, to enter into volume production of EVs, has been taken by the company as its rival Tesla is investing enormous amount for the mass production of the Model 3.An upsurge in EV investment in China, the world’s largest auto market, can be attributed to the efforts adopted by the mainland to tackle air pollution. This has led to the lowering of battery prices and growing appeal of the EV technology. Other German automakers are also investing a huge amount of money for EVs. Apart from China, Europe and the United States, Volkswagen also sees huge opportunities in other areas, including South America. (Read more: Volkswagen to Meet EV Target on Rising Demand)Volkswagen currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.4.    Per Reuters, Nissan Motor Co. (NSANY  -  Free Report) is reportedly cutting down its production in North America by about 20%. Waning profitability in the United States has prompted the automaker to make such a move.Notably, considerable growth in vehicle sales in the United States in the past can be attributed to higher discounting and fleet sales. This, however, eroded the profitability of the second-largest Japanese automaker. The declining profitability has prompted the automaker to rethink its strategy and cut down production in North America.Nissan’s sales in the United States declined 6.5% so far in 2018, due to slow demand for its high-volume Altima sedan and popular Rogue crossover sports utility vehicles (SUVs). Huge discounts for Altima, Rogue crossover SUV and other models were responsible for the sharp decline in Nissan’s North American operating profit.Presently, production cuts are in progress at Nissan’s two assembly plants n the United States and three in Mexico. However, production will not be completely stopped, with the cutbacks likely to complete later this year. Now, the company aims at improving profitability in North America while also raising sales in China, which is the biggest auto market in the world. (Read more: Nissan to Lower North American Output, Raise Profitability)Nissan currently has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).5.    Tesla is reportedly not only struggling with its Model 3 production target in the United States but also in the international markets. This has prompted the automaker to extend the launch of Model 3 at the overseas markets to the next year.The company’s CEO, Elon Musk informed that the left-hand drive of Model 3 will be rolled out in the first half of 2019 in Asia and Europe. The company initially targeted to release the vehicle in the later-half of 2018. Further, the right-hand drive Model 3 units for the United Kingdom and other countries are anticipated to launch in the middle of 2019.Tesla has been struggling to manufacture 5,000 Model 3 units as a weekly target by the end of second-quarter 2018. In order to meet the target, the company announced the addition of another working shift for general assembling, body and paint at its hub in Fremont, CA. Earlier, in the first quarter, Tesla manufactured 2,020 Model 3 vehicles per week, lagging from its target of 2,500 units.Additionally, Musk announced that Tesla is holding the production of the low-cost Model 3 sedan version. The $35,000 low-cost version will be available after the company reaches its goal of producing 5k units of premium edition every week.

1743,HOG,"The NBA Finals begin Thursday night, with two of the league’s biggest stars, LeBron James and Steph Curry, set to face off for the NBA title. But while many will look at how the Cleveland Cavaliers and Golden State Warriors played up to this point, it’s also a great time to check out how some of the NBA’s biggest sponsors performed during the season.Sports Apparel The common thought among many investors is that Curry’s star power hasn’t helped Under Armour UAA stock much over the last year, as it tries to adjust to life as a much bigger company. Curry’s direct impact is debatable, but the company’s stock price has performed rather well since the start of the 2017-18 NBA season in mid-October.Let’s take a look at how it has stacked up against the NBA’s official jersey sponsor and basketball shoe juggernaut, Nike NKE, as well as Adidas ADDYY. Investors will see that despite some of the recent love thrown Adidas’ way, both Nike and Under Armour stock have greatly outperformed the German sports apparel powerhouse since the start of the NBA season. Clearly, there are many other factors impacting these stocks aside from the exposure that the NBA provides, but it is a fun exercise nonetheless.Jersey Sponsors  Nike, which became the official jersey sponsor of the NBA this season, greatly outpaced its two closest rivals. With that said, this season also marked the first time the NBA allowed jersey sponsorship patches. In total, 21 out of the 30 teams played with a patch during the first season, with companies paying an average of $6.5 million per year to place their logo on a team’s jersey—worn by both the players and fans.The inaugural jersey patch season saw some major publicly traded companies join in on the NBA’s growing business. This list includes General Electric (GE  -  Free Report), Disney (DIS  -  Free Report), Harley-Davidson (HOG  -  Free Report), Western Union WU, Fitbit (FIT  -  Free Report), Lending Tree (TREE  -  Free Report), Sun Life (SLF  -  Free Report), Ultimate Software (ULTI  -  Free Report), and Goodyear (GT  -  Free Report).Clearly, some of the bigger names on the list have all gone through a massively disappointing stretch during their first year as official team jersey sponsors. It’s also worth noting that three out of the four conference finals teams that had a sponsor this year—the Warriors and Japanese electronics firm Rakuten RKUNY; the Cavaliers and Goodyear; and the Boston Celtics and GE—all saw their stocks prices fall over 25% since the start of the season.But don’t be surprised if underperforming companies continue their sponsorships as these investments offer a ton of exposure for a relatively small amount of marketing dollars. This becomes even more likely when looking at the NBA’s television ratings, which saw an 8% surge across the league’s four TV-network partners, Disney’s ABC and ESPN, Turner’s  TNT, and NBA TV.TV Partners Investors might remember that the NBA is currently benefiting hugely from its nine-year, $24 billion rights deal with ESPN and Turner that runs through the '24-25 season. This is significant money even for these entertainment giants, which means it’s worth taking a look at how ESPN parent Disney and Turner owner Time Warner have performed throughout this season.Biggest Corporate Sponsors Lastly, it is worth taking a look at some of the NBA’s overall corporate partners, which not only advertise heavily but also sponsor the league. Three of the league’s biggest corporate partners are American Express Company (AXP  -  Free Report), Anheuser-Busch InBev (BUD  -  Free Report), and PepsiCo (PEP  -  Free Report) via Frito-Lay, Mountain Dew, and Gatorade.Obviously, all of the companies touched on throughout this article have much larger priorities beyond their affiliation with the NBA. Therefore, none of this stock price movement is a direct reflection on the NBA’s growing business, which saw its overall sponsor revenue surge 31% to $1.12 billion—placing it not too far behind the NFL.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 19X over. Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we're willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation.See Them Free>>

1744,HOG,"The NBA Finals tip off Thursday night, pitting LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers against Steph Curry and the Golden State Warriors for the fourth straight season. The speculation and predictions have already begun, but let’s leave the guessing to the NBA experts and look instead at the NBA’s rapidly growing business.James, who is set to play for his eighth straight NBA title, Curry, and Kevin Durant are all global superstars. All three are some of the biggest names for some of the biggest sports apparel companies in the world, Nike (NKE  -  Free Report) for James and Durant, and Under Armour (UAA  -  Free Report) for Curry.The three biggest names in the NBA Finals are also successful pitchmen as well as investors, making millions on and off the court. On top of the success of these superstars, the NBA has become one of the most successful sports leagues in the world and its business has never been bigger.TV RatingsThe NBA saw its overall national TV ratings climb 8% from last season to hit 1.28 million, according to Nielsen. This uptick comes across the league’s four television-network partners: Disney’s (DIS  -  Free Report) ABC and ESPN, Turner’s  TNT, and NBA TV. The 2017/18 season also marked the NBA’s best overall ratings average since the 2013/14 season and stands in stark contrast to the NFL’s ratings decline.The league has also performed well on television throughout the playoffs. The struggling ESPN’s overall NBA playoff ratings were up 31% from 2017, with Game 7 of the Eastern Conference finals drawing 13.305 million viewers—which marked the second-largest total for an NBA game in ESPN history. Meanwhile, TNT’s coverage of the Western Conference finals climbed roughly 33%.These ratings will be fun to pay attention to throughout the NBA Finals as the league’s performance on television might have major implications for sponsorship partners and help determine the NBA’s negotiating power going forward.  Sponsors The NBA introduced for the first time this season jersey sponsorship patches, which allowed teams to negotiate their own deals with companies for the rights to a 2.5 inch by 2.5 inch patch on players’ left sleeves. In total, 21 out of the league’s 30 teams played with a patch during the first season, with notable teams from big markets, including the Chicago Bulls and Houston Rockets, taking the court without patches.With that said, the rest of the teams made some big money from deals. The average patch deal brought in roughly $6.5 million per year, and accounted for roughly $137 million of total sponsorship revenue, according to IEG/ESP.The recent influx of new revenue helped the NBA pull in $1.12 billion in total sponsorship money this season, which marked a 31% surge from the $861 million last season. It is also worth noting that the NBA rested just behind the NFL’s $1.25 billion.General Electric (GE  -  Free Report), Disney, Harley-Davidson (HOG  -  Free Report), Western Union (WU  -  Free Report), eBay (EBAY  -  Free Report)-owned StubHub, and Fitbit (FIT  -  Free Report) were just some of the notable jersey sponsors in the inaugural season. The two teams that face off in the NBA finals stand to help provide even more exposure for their corporate sponsors: Japanese electronics firm Rakuten RKUNY for the defending champion Warriors, and Goodyear (GT  -  Free Report) for its hometown Cavaliers.The 2018 NBA Finals mark another first for the NBA when it comes to boosting its top line, with Google’s (GOOGL  -  Free Report) YouTube TV acting as the first-ever presenting sponsor for the NBA Finals. The YouTube TV logo will appear all over the place, including the official NBA Finals logo. Meanwhile, select markets are also expected to be able to watch ABC’s NBA Finals coverage on YouTube TV.Looking AheadFrom the NBA’s partnership with Take-Two Interactive and Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) Twitch on its new esports league to its active expansion in China and other growth markets, the NBA’s business looks poised to keep on booming.Going forward, these deals should help the NBA become even more popular and relevant as it fights to stay on the cutting-edge of content distribution and outside the box business ventures.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

1750,HOG,"With several companies releasing their quarterly results in a row, a few automakers, namely Harley-Davidson, Inc. (HOG  -  Free Report), General Motors Company (GM  -  Free Report) and PACCAR, Inc. (PCAR  -  Free Report) also recently reported third-quarter figures. While Harley-Davidson’s earnings per share came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate, both General Motors’ and PACCAR’s bottom lines beat the estimates.Three important auto and parts manufacturers, expected to come up with their earnings numbers on Oct 26 are, Ford Motor Company (F  -  Free Report), LKQ Corporation (LKQ  -  Free Report) and BorgWarner Inc. (BWA  -  Free Report).As of Oct 18, per the latest Earnings Outlook, 52 S&P 500 members have already revealed their quarterly earnings results. Of these companies, the beat ratios of earnings and revenues are 76.9% and 73.1%, respectively. From the Auto sector, 10% has reported quarterly earnings figures.For third-quarter 2017, earnings and revenue growth for the auto companies is expected to be more on the negative side. The sector is expected to record 17.4% and 5.6% year-over-year decline in earnings and revenues, respectively. However, companies under the S&P 500 category will come up with 3% and 4.9% year-over-year growth in earnings and revenues, respectively.In order to tackle air pollution problems, many countries are focusing on use of electric cars. This new paradigm shift has prompted many automakers to transfer their attention from gasoline and diesel-automobiles to electric cars. With this move, the companies have to balance current strategies as well as invest in future industrial trends and changes.Let’s take a look at the three auto companies, scheduled to announce results on Oct 26.We relied on the Zacks methodology, combining a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) with a positive Earnings ESP, to predict the chances of an earnings beat this quarter. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Per our proprietary methodology, Earnings ESP shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Research shows that with this ideal combination of two key ingredients — Zacks Rank and ESP — chances of a positive earnings surprise are as high as 70% for the stocks lined up for an earnings announcement.A multinational automaker, headquartered in Dearborn, MI, Ford manufactures and distributes automobiles in 200 markets across six continents. Our model predicts that the company is not likely to deliver an earnings beat as it currently has an Earnings ESP of -9.43% and a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Therefore, we caution against all Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.In 2017, the company expects the adjusted EPS to be in the range of $1.65-$1.85. Also, the company’s frequent vehicle recalls to fix safety issues is increasing the capital expenditure.

Our model does not conclusively predict that the company is likely to beat estimates this quarter as it currently has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and a Zacks Rank #3. Although the bullish rank increases the predictive power of ESP, the company’s 0.00% ESP however, makes surprise prediction difficult.The company expects organic sales growth in the 4-5.25% range compared with the earlier guided range of 4-6%, in 2017. This is majorly due to the acquisition of Andrew Page that is affecting its gross margin. However, its effort to lower the operational costs as well as the capital expenditure within $200-$225 million range might drive its results.
