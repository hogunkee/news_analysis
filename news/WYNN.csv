UHNW households grew by 90,000 to 1.35 million, and ""$25 million plus"" households grew by 16,000 to 172,000.The long bull market is the main reason for growth in the ranks of millionaire households. ""We had an excellent year in 2017 and in other years, when the market was up,"" said Tom Wynn, Spectrem's director of affluent research. ""The main reason the millionaire numbers are up is because people's investments rose in value.""Stock market gains are why the richest households — those with net worth of $25 million and up — grew the most in 2017.""The richest households put more of their wealth to work in the stock market,"" Wynn said. ""So they've benefited from the bull market.""Inheritances by baby boomers also play a role, Wynn says, but a much smaller one.The biggest personal concerns of millionaires — heads of millionaire households, to be precise — include maintaining their current financial status, health of their spouse, their own health and the possibility of a family health catastrophe.YOU MAY ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:In A Volatile Market, Should You Go To Cash From Your Mutual Funds — Or Stay The Course?You Need This Much Retirement Savings At Your Age And Income

30,WYNN,"Dow futures rose ahead of Tuesday's open, but lagged behind the Nasdaq and S&P 500 as the market gathered up to face a double dose of resistance. Caterpillar (CAT), Verizon (VZ) and United Technologies (UTX) stirred Dow futures early, as crude oil prices gained and investors dug into the session's long list of earnings results.Dow futures rose 0.6%, as Caterpillar forged a strong early lead, but premarket losses from Travelers (TRV) and 3M (MMM) limited gains. S&P 500 futures advanced 0.7%. Nasdaq 100 futures narrowed their early gains to 0.7%, with Paccar (PCAR) leading. But heavy losses from Incyte (INCY) and Biogen (BIIB) tempered the advance.The Dow has logged four straight declines. The Nasdaq has slipped in the past three sessions and the S&P 500 in two of the past three. The results left all three indexes back below resistance at their 50-day moving averages. The declines also pushed the Dow and S&P into negative territory for the year. The Dow industrials ended Monday down 1% for the year. The S&P 500 carried a 0.1% decline.The Nasdaq holds a 3.3% gain. But both the Dow and the S&P 500 must push past their 50-day lines, as well as into positive territory for the year, in order to put the market's struggling uptrend back on track.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

31,WYNN,"S&P 500 futures rose solidly early Tuesday morning, along with Dow Jones futures and Nasdaq futures, as the 10-year Treasury yield pulled back from 3%. Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) rose modestly after reporting strong earnings late Monday. Google's report has implications for Facebook (FB), Twitter (TWTR), Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT).The S&P 500 index, Dow Jones and Nasdaq composite all hit resistance at the 50-day moving average on Monday. Blame three key factors: Apple (AAPL) undercutting more support, the chip sector continuing to sell off and the 10-year Treasury yield moving to the edge of 3%.S&P 500 futures rose 0.6% vs. fair value. Dow Jones futures were 0.6% higher. Nasdaq 100 futures advanced 0.75%. That suggests that they'll all make a run at their 50-day moving averages once again. But can they retake and hold that key support?It will be a heavy day of earnings before and after the open. Last night, Alphabet earnings beat estimates, even excluding an investment gain for its Uber stake. Revenue growth was the strongest in years. But traffic acquisition costs and capital spending both surged, slashing profit margins. In late trading, Google's parent fell slightly. But the stock was slightly higher before the open in the stock market today.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

Google also signaled cloud computing was growing rapidly as it competes vs. Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure.Facebook, Amazon, Twitter and Microsoft rose modestly in premarket trading. All four report later this week.In Monday's session, the S&P 500 closed a fraction higher, while the Nasdaq composite and Dow Jones fell modestly. But the major averages all continued to hold below their 50-day moving averages after falling below that key level Friday. In both sessions, the culprits were largely the same: Apple, chip stocks and Treasury yields.Apple fell 0.3% to 165.24, a modest retreat, amid fresh signs of weak iPhone X demand. But the stock fell below its 200-day moving average. Aside from a few days during the brief stock market correction in early February, Apple hadn't undercut that level since July 2016.Apple, which has skidded 7.3% in the past four sessions, also has undercut the low of its consolidation. Upside? Apple could now create a double-bottom base with a slightly lower entry. So, a relentless Apple bull could claim that the iPhone maker moved closer to a buy point on Monday.Shares rose 0.3% in the premarket, which would push Apple back to  its 200-day.The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index retreated 1.3% on Monday, undercutting recent lows to its worst levels since the February correction. The Philly Sox index is just above its 200-day line, an area of support that it hasn't breached since July 2016. The semiconductor index has retreated 7.6% over the last four sessions.The 10-year Treasury yield rose as high as 2.99%, settling for a modest rise to 2.975% after moving to a four-year high on Friday. The benchmark rate dipped to just under 2.97% on Tuesday, easing pressure on stock futures.Treasury yields are rising amid growing inflation concerns as well as the related risk of additional Fed rate hikes. Higher interest rates, all other things being equal, act as a brake on growth, making borrowing, such as for mortgages, more expensive. They make bonds relatively more attractive for investors. The higher yields also have pushed the U.S. dollar index to a three-month high. That makes U.S. exports less competitive and reducing the profitability of foreign operations for U.S. multinationals, in dollar terms.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:The Big Picture: Stock Indexes Struggle To Cross This Key LevelWill The Stock Market Rally Continue?

In Murphy v. NCAA, New Jersey appealed the law and the Supreme Court on Monday found in the state's favor.This could have massive implications, as sports betting bills exist in some form in roughly half the 50 states. However analysts believe there may be less gold at the end of the rainbow than is believed.'We think the time to play the impact of sports betting in the U.S. is sooner than later, as we believe the 10,000-foot-view of what the opportunity could mean, is likely to be better than the reality of what it ultimately does mean,"" Deutsche Bank analyst Carlo Santarelli said in a research note.He cited the case of online gaming legalization in New Jersey in 2013, where estimates of market size far outpaced the ultimate reality of the market. Then Governor Chris Christie claimed the market could be worth $1.2 billion, however, first-year revenue in 2014 ended up coming in at $123 million.""While we don't want to be overly dismissive, we believe; 1) market size is likely to be lower than expectations as player conversion to legal markets could be lower than perceived, 2) a state by state rollout will take time, as will the ramp periods, & 3) EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) margins will be thin,"" Santarelli said.On the other hand ease of use and trust of payment, and the ability to attract those who would like to bet but do not want to break the law will attract customers.The American Gaming Association has estimated that $150 billion is bet annually on sports. However analysts don't think that those who bet illegally will become legal bettors en masse.""Issues which could possibly curb market size include: 1) there will be no float in legal sports betting, meaning you can't bet what you don't have, and yes, that happens, 2) tradition and relationships with ""your guy,"" and 3) an unwillingness to allow governments to see further into an individual's financials,"" Santarelli said.Jefferies analysts estimates a legal sports betting handle, excluding Nevada and Delaware, of between $1.2 and $57.6 billion, and has used $23.9 billion as its base case. Deutsche Bank estimates a total market size of around $4 billion in sports book revenue across 13 states in 2023.There may be an opportunity for a nimble competitor to outmaneuver the bigger companies and run a sports book across a number of regional casinos, who would cash in buy leasing space out to the bookies.""Other than the largest operators in (Nevada), most should outsource bookmaking which bears a cost against profits, while the operating platform also bears a cost,"" Jefferies analyst David Katz said in a research note. ""The issue of negotiating and establishing regulations and issuing licenses has historically been time-consuming, which pushes the earnings opportunities further out.""The most lucrative, but also the most risky, aspect of sports betting is running the sports book itself. While industry giant Caesars could operate its own book, analysts believe both Penn and Boyd's are more likely to outsource. They will profit by leasing floor space and taking a cut of the profits.Due to the outsourcing dimension, British bookmaker William Hill could be a big winner, with Canter Gaming and another U.K. firm Ladbrokes also seen as being well-placed. William Hill is currently Nevada's sports betting leader with a 55% market share. The company operates 108 of Nevada's 192 sports books and is the risk manager for sports betting within the Delaware lottery.Last week its U.S. operations enjoyed the biggest growth of all divisions across its whole group during Q1, with revenue rising by 45%. It would have the vital expertise needed to operate a sports book on a large scale.The big casino companies are keeping their cards close to their chest on the issue, with many declining to comment. However there is one firm that seems eager to take advantage if the chips fall the right way.""Boyd Gaming views expanded sports betting as an intriguing growth opportunity. We have more than 40 years of experience in sports betting, we operate one of the largest sports book networks in the state of Nevada, and we currently have operations in seven different states (expanding to 10 by the end of the year),"" a spokesman said. ""Should the Supreme Court repeal PAPSA, Boyd Gaming is in an excellent position to become a leading player in the growth and expansion of sports betting in the U.S.""Meanwhile the NBA has been criticized for seeking an ""integrity fee,"" which would levy a proposed 1% of every placed wager if legalization is approved. The league argues the money-spinning move is necessary.""Our games would serve as the foundation for legalized sports betting, providing casinos the ability to earn revenue off our games while we bear all of the risk, and would incur additional expenses for compliance and enforcement,"" NBA spokesman Mike Bass said. ""As a result, we believe it is reasonable for casinos to compensate the NBA with a small percentage of the total amount bet on our games.""However Santarelli said the idea is a ""nonstarter"" as it and that it acts as an effective 20% revenue tax. He said the levy would ""essentially wipe out the potential for reasonable profits.""When it comes to the Supreme Court decision itself, the NBA would still prefer for a federal solution.""Our preference is a comprehensive federal approach rather than state-by-state regulation, but we will continue to work with all states seeking our input on a regulated framework that protects the integrity of our game and fairly compensates the NBA's teams and players.""The NFL has maintained public opposition to sports betting, and last year Commissioner Roger Goodell said the league is also against individual states regulating their own gambling industries, despite the league's Raiders franchise moving to gambling mecca Las Vegas.MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred has previously advocated the league change its opposition, though the league has yet to officially change its stance.""While we have no position on whether states should allow sports betting, we are talking to stakeholders in every state considering the issue,"" an MLB spokesman said. ""We have an obligation to our fans and our sport to help ensure the integrity of our games is protected, which can be done through a strong law requiring airtight coordination between the state, the casino operators and the sports leagues to closely monitor wagers.""The NHL has yet to take a public position on the subject, however it allows bets to be placed on its Vegas Golden Knights games in Nevada.The players associations from the four big leagues have banded together and seem keen to secure their own slice of the pie.""Betting on sports may become widely legal, but we cannot allow those who have lobbied the hardest for sports gambling to be the only ones controlling how it would be ushered into our businesses,"" they said in a joint statement.

Shares peaked at 194.30 intraday. The relative strength line, which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, is at a three-year high. But the stock's volume was well below normal.

YY is seeing strong earnings and revenue growth via users livestreaming themselves performing music or comedy, playing video games, or even eating. Last Tuesday YY blasted past an 83.10 buy point from a cup base, rising 9% in double normal volume. YY continued to edge higher the rest of the week. On Friday, YY briefly became extended, rising as high as 89.37, past the 5% chase zone that extends to 87.26. But YY pared gains to close at 86.83.Back in late July, Advanced Energy Industries reported 67% earnings growth in the second quarter and a 40% revenue gain, both better than expected. The chip-equipment maker also guided views higher.Advanced Energy Industries on Friday rose 3.1% to 80.76, clearing a cup-with-handle base entry of 78.95. Volume was 33% above normal, which is OK but not great. The stock had rebounded from its 50-day line on Wednesday.Nvidia is now back in a buy zone, but investors should be cautious. Technically, Nvidia is in a second-stage base because its early 2017 consolidation just undercut a prior base, but the stock has been on a huge run for the past three years, as Nvidia's graphics chips are in high demand for self-driving cars, artificial intelligence and even bitcoin mining.Nvidia roared out of a flat base with a 174.66 entry on Sept. 15, rising as high as 191.20 the following session, 9.5% over the buy point.

But two days later, Nvidia moved back above the 174.66 entry, finishing the week at 178.67. Nvidia rose 1.25% to 181 before the opening bell on the stock market today.Investors should never let a 10% gain go to zero or turn into a loss. Because Nvidia only rose 9.5% above its buy point, and didn't fall 7% below its buy point, the stock's old entry is still valid. But it hasn't been great action.Electronic Arts broke out of a flat base with a 116.14 buy point on July 26, a day before reporting solid earnings. Since then, EA's stock has largely traded sideways, with a few brief forays just above or below 5% buy zone.On last Monday's tech stock shakeout, Electronic Arts fell 3.6% to 114.20, dropping below its buy point and through its 50-day moving average. But by Thursday, EA was back in buy range and closed the week at 118.05, back above its 50-day line.Video game makers like EA are counting on a strong holiday season.Paycom offers cloud-based payroll and human resource software, mostly for small- to mid-sized businesses.

81,WYNN,"Wynn Resorts (WYNN) broke out Friday as casino stocks rallied on news that Macau gaming revenue rose 20% in August, despite the city getting hit by a typhoon during the month.Macau's casinos brought in $2.82 billion, or 22.7 billion patacas, in revenue for the month, according to Reuters. That marks the 13th straight month of growth, but a sequential slowdown from the July's year-over-year gain of 29.2%. Macau's gaming revenue has been recovering after slipping in recent years due to crackdowns on money laundering and corruption. Macau is the only place in China where gambling is legal.Shares of Wynn Resorts closed 3.2% higher at 143.42 on the stock market today, hitting the highest level since March 2015. That cleared a 139.77 entry point out of a two-month flat base.Several other Macau-exposed casino giants enjoyed more-modest gains Friday as they begin building the right side of their own flat-base consolidations.Las Vegas Sands (LVS) rose 1.1% to finish at 62.87, closing on a 66.32 buy point. The stock cleared its 50-day moving average on Thursday.

The Hong Kong-domiciled casino operator has a 24.04 buy point.According to the Guardian, Typhoon Hato killed eight people in Macau, hitting southern China late in the month and cutting power in Macau's casinos.

But shares fell 4.5% to 162.87 on Monday in heavy volume, tumbling below their 50-day moving average and undercutting the low of their current consolidation. Tesla extended its post-breakout reversal to more than 7% below its 370.10 entry — and through its 50-day to boot — making that buy point invalid. Nvidia round-tripped a 9.5% gain from a buy point, sinking 4.5% to 171, below the 174.66 entry. Apple fell 0.9% to 150.55, following a 5% sell-off last week.Facebook, Tesla and Apple shares did rise a fraction in premarket trading Tuesday. Nvidia climbed nearly 3% after announcing late Monday that it will supply AI-focused chips to several Chinese cloud-computing and server firms.Oil and gas groups and stocks continue to rack up big and steady gains, as crude oil prices have rebounded to their best levels since April.Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) and Valero (VLO) have cleared buy points, while BP (BP) and the Dow's Chevron are close.The key question for these stocks and the broader sector is whether oil and other energy prices keep rising — and when and how quickly shale operators ramp up their production.U.S. crude futures dipped 0.4% in premarket trading to $52 a barrel.Despite Tesla's recent reversal, the broad transportation sector is healthy, from shipping giants FedEx (FDX) and UPS (UPS) to General Motors (GM) and Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) to trucking firms J.B. Hunt Transport (JBHT) and Old Dominion Freight Line (ODFL) to auto- and truck-parts firms such as Dana (DCN) and Lear (LEA) to RV makers Winnebago (WGO) and Thor Industries (THO).Focusing on single-industry success stories, IBD's Aerospace/Defense group is faring well.

83,WYNN,"Amid a grinding-higher market, Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Biogen (BIIB), Electronic Arts (EA), Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) and Wynn Resorts (WYNN) are highly rated big-cap stocks holding in buy zones after breaking out several days or weeks ago.XIdeally, stocks will blast out of bases and then rapidly add to gains, and there are some breakouts like that. But in the current market environment many stocks just edge past entry points, with shares soon pulling back below them, at least temporarily. Apple chipmaker Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) and chip-gear maker Teradyne (TER) both fell back below entry areas on Monday after breaking out Friday. While their breakouts aren't failures, their high-volume retreats aren't encouraging.Apple broke out of a flat base with a 156.75 buy point on Aug. 2, the day after reporting strong earnings and guidance. The iPhone giant did dip below that entry point a few times over the next few weeks, but since Aug. 21 the stock has stayed in a buy zone.Apple has trended lower since unveiling its new iPhones, with the high-end iPhone X not set for release until Nov. 2. Shares fell 0.8% to 158.67 in Monday stock market trading. One report said that iPhone 8 preorders appear so-so, perhaps as buyers hold off for the X model.Apple's 50-day moving average could offer further support as that key line has risen to about the entry level.Microsoft has been grinding higher in 2017, modestly outpacing the S&P 500 index. Microsoft has been breaking out, then pulling back below the entry area before finally moving higher, sometimes after forming a new consolidation.Microsoft cleared a base-on-base formation with a 74.52 entry back on Aug. 31. True to form, Microsoft pulled back the following day and didn't hold above the entry until Sept. 11. Shares hit a record-high 75.97 intraday Monday, but reversed to close down 0.2% at 75.16.Biogen soared 4.2% on Aug. 30, blowing past a 312.50 buy point from a 13-month consolidation. Shares continued to advance, becoming slightly extended at times but only closing above the 5% chase zone on Sept. 12. Since then, Biogen has retreated for the past four sessions, sliding nearly 1% on Monday to 318.18, still comfortably in a buy zone.Celgene just edged past a 139.10 buy point on Sept. 1, though that capped a huge 7.5% weekly gain as Celgene rallied on investor optimism for drugmakers with ties to CAR-T immuno-oncology treatments. Aside from an intraday drop on the next session, Sept. 5, Celgene has basically held in a buy range, slowly trending higher. Celgene rose 0.6% to 142.84 on Monday, setting a record 143.40 intraday.The video game publisher cleared a 116.14 buy point on July 26, just before the Nasdaq hit a short-term high. Electronics Arts tested that entry point several times, closing below it on Aug. 10-11. But since then EA has generally stayed within the 5% buy zone. Shares edged up 0.45% to 119.96 on Monday.EA's 50-day line has risen to just above the entry level, offering a possible backstop for the stock.Alexion, the last of three biotechs highlighted here, sold off from July 2015 to May 2017. But since then the stock has rebounded. On Sept. 1, shares cleared a 142.57 first-stage-base buy point. A week later, Alexion closed just below that entry, but hasn't done that since.Alexion will cut 20% of staff, the biotech said last week, to spend more on research.Alexion fell 2.1% to 143.64 on Monday.The casino giant rose strongly past a 139.77 flat-base buy point on Sept. 1. Since then shares have stayed in the buy zone, aside from flirting with becoming extended. Wynn Resorts rose 0.4% to 143.84 on Monday. Fellow Macau-centric casinos Melco Resorts (MLCO) and Las Vegas Sands (LVS) have formed cup bases, with Melco just carving out a handle on Monday.Just because these seven stocks have generally held in a buy zone doesn't mean they'll stay that way. Some may begin to move sharply higher while others falter.

""While passage of tax reform may provide mid-single digit upside to the S&P 500, we also estimate that equity allocations for most investor types are near historical highs, potentially leaving them less willing to increase allocations to U.S. equities further.

106,WYNN,"Extreme Networks (EXTR), the one-time highflier from the dot-com era that crashed and disappeared from radar screens for more than a decade, is now one of the top stocks in one of the market's strongest-performing industry groups.X After a second attempt at reinventing itself in 2015, Extreme is now ranked No. 2 by IBD Stock Checkup — based on earnings, sales, margins and stock performance trends — in the Computer-Networking group, which is ranked No. 6 among 197 industry groups.Extreme's resurgence began after it installed board member Ed Meyercord as chief executive. Meyercord pared down the company, narrowing its focus and stabilizing its finances, before beginning to build it up piece by piece.""They decided the acquisition strategy was the right strategy,"" said D.A. Davidson Co. analyst Mark Kelleher, even after high hopes for its $180 million acquisition of Enterasys Networks in 2013 were largely dashed.Now, Extreme has shown that it has the right team in place to execute on its vision. It's pushing past the $1 billion annual revenue threshold and is throwing off enough cash to make key technology acquisitions that have broadened out its product set.Extreme bills itself as the only pure play end-to-end enterprise networking company with software-driven solutions that go from the wireless edge to the data center. It's the clear No. 3 in the enterprise network market, behind the dominant leader Cisco Systems (CSCO), and No. 2 Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), and growing faster than the mature market in which it competes.That position doesn't just reflect its third-place revenue share, still only about 4% of the market, but also its ranking by Gartner, which puts Extreme a close third behind Cisco and HP — and well ahead of the rest — both in its ability to execute and the completeness of its product vision.Gartner's September report also highlighted Extreme's ""strong customer service through a 100% insourced service and support team.""Meyercord said on a Nov. 7 fiscal first-quarter earnings call that Extreme is leveraging its recognition from Gartner, which he called ""one of the most relied-upon resources for enterprise customers"" and ""the best marketing we have,"" according to a Seeking Alpha transcript.Extreme is ""taking share from our larger competitors,"" Chief Financial Officer Drew Davies told a Needham networking and security conference on Nov. 14. He highlighted business wins in the past couple of weeks, including the Wynn Boston Harbor resort and a competitive bidding win at Raytheon.In its latest acquisition, which closed in October, Extreme bought Brocade's data center switching, routing and analytics assets for $55 million in cash. The deal is on track to add $230 million in revenue for Extreme in the first year.Broadcom (AVGO), which acquired the rest of Brocade, was willing to part with that portion of its business so as not to compete against the networking vendors such as Extreme that use Broadcom chipsets to power their switches, D.A. Davidson's Kelleher told Investor's Business Daily.IBD'S TAKE: Shares of Extreme Networks were whipsawed in a volatile week for technology stocks. The upshot from a technical perspective is that the stock will have to work on a new base with a 14.44 buy point, the point at which an investor has the best opportunity for significant near-term gains. A leading stock in a leading industry group can be a recipe for a winning stock if bought at the right time.Kelleher said Extreme's strategy to build a complete enterprise networking offering by putting together pieces such as Brocade's data center business makes a lot of sense.Because of various mergers — and, in the case of Avaya, a bankruptcy — Extreme has been able to pick up ""all of these embedded assets that weren't being optimized,"" Kelleher said.Kelleher expects there will be more such acquisition opportunities ahead, though he expects Extreme to take about six months to digest its latest purchase.In July, Extreme strengthened its competitive position when it closed on its purchase of Avaya's networking assets, which it won with a $100-million bid. Extreme said the deal would add to earnings and produce $200 million in annual revenue.In October 2016, Extreme finalized its purchase of the wireless local area network business of Zebra Technologies (ZBRA), which is expected to generate more than $115 million in fiscal 2018 revenue.Those three acquisitions have essentially doubled the total addressable market opportunity for Extreme from $8 billion to $16 billion.""(Extreme's) strong (first) quarter was driven by the better than expected results of the Zebra and Avaya transactions,"" wrote Needham analyst Alex Henderson. ""The new employees are delivering better-than-expected productivity.""Henderson said Extreme's staff is now unencumbered by the constraints of their prior company structures. In Henderson's view, the new Extreme is proving through the ""exceptionally smooth integration of the Zebra acquisition"" that the company can execute on its acquisition strategy.On the fiscal first-quarter earnings call, Meyercord called the Brocade deal an ""important piece of the puzzle that helps us complete our enterprise networking solutions portfolio,"" enabling it to meet the large-scale data-center needs of Fortune 500 customers.Extreme now has 30,000 customers, after a picking up a large base of blue-chip clients via acquisitions, and one of its keys to growth will be cross-selling opportunities. Gartner says government and education have been Extreme's main vertical markets, but that customers in retail, hospitality, manufacturing and healthcare also ""should consider Extreme.""Henderson noted that Extreme more than doubled the number of $1 million-plus deals in its past two quarters.Outside of acquisitions, Extreme has been generating positive organic revenue growth in the low-single digits in recent quarters, an improvement after the retrenchment in 2015, and analysts see some potential for further improvement. Yet, Extreme's target market is only expected to grow an annualized 2% in coming years, so acquisitions and market-share gains will have to be growth drivers.For the December quarter, Extreme offered revenue guidance of $236 million to $246 million, well above the $224 million consensus. The guidance for EPS of 10 cents-14 cents was below the 18-cent estimate, but analysts have downplayed that as a function of timing of the Brocade deal.The quarterly results won't include October, always a relatively big month for the Brocade data-center business. That means Extreme will get more of a cost bump than a revenue bump for this one quarter.Shares of Extreme were down Friday by 0.9% to 12.74.RELATED:Extreme Networks In Buy Range, With NFL Wi-Fi Season In Full-SwingWhy This Networking Firm's Shares Jumped To A Two-Month HighEarnings Beat, Buying Spree Are Driving This 'Extreme' BreakoutStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth Stocks

116,WYNN,"Casino stocks initially fell Monday but ended mixed as markets reacted to a mass shooting at a music festival in Las Vegas and MGM Resorts' (MGM) announcement that its China unit would delay opening its newest casino in Macau.XLas Vegas Metropolitan Police Department Sheriff Joseph Lombardo said 58 were killed and 515 were injured, after a gunman opened fire outside the Route 91 Harvest country music festival, via a room at the Mandalay Bay Casino, which is operated by MGM.The suspected shooter has been identified as Stephen Paddock, who reportedly committed suicide before police entered his hotel room. The incident is seen as the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history.MGM shares sank 5.6% to close at 30.77 on the stock market today. The casino operator's shares had been hovering around their 50-day line after a breakout on Sept. 7 failed. Despite a big push into China, MGM is still the most U.S.-exposed casino operator.Wynn Resorts (WYNN) fell 1.2% to 147.07, but still above buy range after breaking out of a flat base on Sept. 1 with a 139.77 buy point, while Las Vegas Sands (LVS) rose 1.3% to 64.97, just below its 65.01 buy point as it tries to break out of a cup with handle base.American Outdoor Brands (AOBC), formerly known as gunmaker Smith & Wesson, rose 3.2%, and Sturm Ruger (RGR) climbed 3.5%.

But just because they are in buy zones, doesn't mean you shouldn't keep an eye on other key factors, like volume, as well as the major averages and leading stocks.Hilton Worldwide on Friday cleared a 67.89 buy point from a three-month long cup base. Though Hilton gained 1.3% to 68.19, volume on the breakout was below average.Marriott International is flirting with a 107.73 buy point from a double-bottom base. Heavy volume on Wednesday, when Marriott first cleared the entry, has been followed by light turnover. Marriott rose 0.3% to 107.88 on Friday, back above the entry, but in light trade.IBD'S TAKE: Looking for more actionable stocks? Make sure to check out MarketSmith's screener tools.

Wynn fell 0.3% to 144.91 on Friday.Melco Resorts broke out of a base last Tuesday, edged above the 5% buy zone intraday Wednesday and is now trading just above the 23.35 buy point, finishing the week at 23.53. Melco's volume was above average for the initial breakout, but the action has cooled.We've been seeing stalling action for many breakouts as of late, with the Nasdaq moving more or less sideways for the month of September.

118,WYNN,"Shares of Wynn Resorts (WYNN) continued to dive on Monday following sexual-misconduct allegations last week against CEO Steve Wynn, as analysts began to parse out the possible fate of the CEO and his company, with one suggesting it could ultimately be sold.X The stock tumbled 9.3% to 163.48 in the stock market today in extremely high volume following a 10% plunge on Friday when a Wall Street Journal report detailed allegations from women who said Wynn pressured them into sexual activity. Wynn Resorts closed below its 50-day moving average, a sell signal given the heavy trading.Wynn has said the notion that he ""ever assaulted any woman is preposterous.""Wynn Resorts' board of directors has formed a committee to investigate the allegations. Regulators from Massachusetts and Nevada are examining the matter. Wynn resigned as the Republican National Committee's finance chairman.The growing scrutiny from regulators has raised questions about how much investors would stand by the company, and how the company might move past the potential loss of one of the industry's biggest innovators. Annual reports from the company cite ""our dependence on Stephen A. Wynn"" as among its risk factors, Barclays noted.And the moves out of Nevada and Massachusetts have raised questions over whether the axis of gambling in the east, Macau — where Wynn Resorts gets most of its sales — might do the same. The company is also seeking a license for a resort in Japan.The research firm Union Gaming and Morgan Stanley both downgraded Wynn Macau in the wake of the allegations. Bloomberg noted that gaming laws in Macau, a Chinese administrative region, factor in the operator's reputation during the bidding for licenses.Barclays analyst Felicia Hendrix, in a research note, said business and leisure customers in Las Vegas, where Wynn's sales have slipped recently, could stay away in the near-term as the allegations damage the company's reputation. But she said sales in Macau were less likely to be affected.However, she said that a sale of the company, as opposed to just Wynn's shares, could be the most likely result from those allegations. The move, she argued, would help preserve the company's value overall, she said.""The quality of WYNN's resorts globally is unprecedented, in our view, and there are a number of public companies (and likely private equity firms) that would be more than willing to acquire these assets if they were to come to the market,"" she wrote. ""Further, there are a number of public companies which do not operate in Macau that would see this as a great opportunity.""""So,"" she added, ""demand could be high for this company if it were to be sold, which could limit the potential downside.""The region — the only place in China where gambling is legal and the world's biggest market for gaming — did the heavy lifting for Wynn's results in the fourth quarter.Gaming sales in Macau jumped around 19% last year, as more VIPs overcame worries over regulator crackdowns in years past and returned more often to gamble there. But, as one analyst told IBD last year, ""You can never relax about Macau,"" and fears of stiffer gambling rules in the region are never far from investors' minds.Las Vegas Sands (LVS) jumped 4.7%, while MGM Resorts International (MGM) added 2.65%.

121,WYNN,"Shares of Wynn Resorts (WYNN) are falling in the wake of a Wall Street Journal report detailing allegations of sexual misconduct against the casino company's CEO, Steve Wynn.X Hours after the report came out, the Massachusetts Gaming Commission said it will conduct a review of the company's Wynn Boston Harbor project.""The suitability and integrity of our gaming licensees is of the utmost importance, and ensuring that suitability is an active and ongoing process,"" the commission said, according to the Boston Business Journal. ""Consequently, the MGC's Investigations and Enforcement Bureau will conduct a regulatory review of this matter to determine the appropriate next steps.""For its bombshell story, the Wall Street Journal interviewed dozens of people, whose allegations would point to decades of sexual misconduct.Wynn, in a statement to the Journal, said ""The idea that I ever assaulted any woman is preposterous."" And he said ""the instigation of these accusations is the continued work of my ex-wife Elaine Wynn, with whom I am involved in a terrible and nasty lawsuit in which she is seeking a revised divorce settlement.""The report details accounts of female employees, including a manicurist and a massage therapist, who said Wynn asked or pressured them to perform sexual acts on him and felt that they had to do so, given his influence in the industry.One incident, in which a manicurist said Wynn pressured her to have sex with him, occurred shortly after the opening of Wynn Las Vegas in 2005 and resulted in a $7.5 million settlement, sources told the Journal.Other employees told the Journal that Wynn ""often walked around some areas of the complex in extremely short shorts without underwear, and he would sit in the salon to get pedicures in such a way that his genitals were exposed.""The report adds that former workers for Wynn properties said they ""sometimes entered fake appointments in the books to help other female workers get around a request for services in Mr. Wynn's office or arranged for others to pose as assistants so they wouldn't be alone with him.""The stock plunged 10.1% to 180.29 in the stock market today in its heaviest volume in years. Wynn closed the week up 0.2% after surging to a fresh 3-year high during the week on its strong earnings and those of peer Las Vegas Sands (LVS).Las Vegas Sands rose 0.2% to 75.50, MGM Resorts (MGM) 0.65% to 37.05 and Caesars Entertainment (CZR) 0.7% to 13.95.If Wynn were forced out of the company — a move that would follow the dismissals of other powerful men in the media and Hollywood — it would mark the departure of one of the most iconic figures in the casino industry, who helped evolve Las Vegas' basic casino industry into a huge casino-resort business and brought a new standard for lavishness to the industry.The allegations come as the nation reckons with workplace sexual harassment and reexamines the boundaries of consent.Las Vegas' economy, meanwhile, is set to remain solid on an influx of tourism and convention business. But as more business comes in and more women come forward, the union speaking for thousands of Las Vegas hotel staff is asking the city's casino and hotel companies to give those attendants panic buttons.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Wynn Resorts Earnings Nearly Triple On Strong Macau RevenueFord Mixed, Las Vegas Sands Beats, United Rental Profit Meets

122,WYNN,"The NBA is backing a state-by-state solution that would pave the way for nationwide sports betting.X While the league had previously called for federal-level reform, it threw its weight behind lower-level legislation for the first time at a meeting of the New York State Senate's Racing, Gaming, and Wagering Committee Wednesday.And in a move that could pour billions into its coffers, it is demanding 1% of every placed wager if legalization is approved.""We support the passage of a comprehensive sports betting bill that would serve as a model for a 50-state solution — whether that happens in Congress or on a state-by-state basis,"" NBA Assistant General Counsel Dan Spillane said in written testimony.The American Gaming Association has estimated that $150 billion is bet annually on sports.Association President and CEO Geoff Freeman welcomed the NBA's testimony, but criticized the league's proposal to take a percentage point of each bet.""Let's get real about eliminating the illegal market, protecting consumers and determining the role of government – a role that most certainly does not include transferring money from bettors to multibillion-dollar sports leagues,"" Freeman said.The AGA claimed a 1% integrity fee on all money wagered legally would amount to 20-29% of total revenue.Shares of Las Vegas Sands (LVS) closed down 0.3% on the stock market today, but rallied late on strong quarterly results. Wynn Resorts (WYNN) climbed 2.9%, MGM Resorts (MGM) gained 1.7%, and Caesars Entertainment (CZR) ended flat.IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now? A good starting point is to regularly review screens that highlight the top-rated equities.New York is one of several states exploring the idea of legalizing gambling. The U.S. Supreme Court is currently mulling over New Jersey's law to legalize sports gambling, and if that clears legal muster it could clear the way for individual states to legalize sports betting at casinos and racetracks.However, the NBA said at the New York Senate committee hearing that any future legislation should not limit betting to just those venues, but also allow wagers on smartphones and the internet.The league also pointed out that most states already offer gambling to citizens through lotteries and noted the relative underdevelopment of sports betting in the U.S. compared to the regulated industries that function in Europe and Australia.""In England, a sports fan can place a legal bet on a smartphone, at a stadium kiosk, or even on a television,"" Spillane said. ""There are extensive regulations in these jurisdictions to protect the integrity of sports and the consumers who place bets.""To ensure the integrity of sports is maintained, the NBA wants leagues to have the right to restrict the types of wagers placed on their events, as certain types of bets are open to manipulation by players.The Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act Of 1992 effectively outlawed sports betting nationwide, except for sports lotteries conducted in Oregon, Delaware and Montana, as well as the licensed sports pools in Nevada.The NFL has maintained public opposition to sports betting, and last year Commissioner Roger Goodell said the league is also against individual states regulating their own gambling industries, despite the Raiders franchise moving to gambling mecca Las Vegas.MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred has advocated the league change its opposition. And while the NHL has yet to take a public position on the subject, it allows bets to be placed on Vegas Golden Knights games in Nevada.

123,WYNN,"Melco Resorts & Entertainment (MLCO) broke out on Tuesday following an upgrade from Nomura Instinet, which said the casino operator stood to benefit from a brighter outlook for gaming revenue in Macau through next year.X""Just reasonable multiple expansion commensurate with improving results in Macau should lift the stock by over 25% over the next 12 months,"" said Nomura Instinet analyst Harry Curtis, who upgraded Melco's stock to buy from neutral and raised his price target to 29 from 20.Shares of Melco rose 3.35% to 23.78 in the stock market today, breaking out of a cup-with-handle base with a 23.35 buy point. Melco finished forming a handle on Monday with the minimum five days.Other casino companies that have operations in Macau, the world's largest gaming hub, followed.Las Vegas Sands (LVS) advanced 1.4% to 64.53, making its way through a cup base with a 66.32 buy point. Las Vegas Sands lost a chance for a lower buy point as its stock rose above the top of a proto-handle on the fifth day.MGM Resorts International (MGM) rebounded 2.8% to 32.56, finding support at its 50-day line. MGM Resorts fell in the prior seven sessions following a failed breakout attempt.Wynn Resorts (WYNN) rose 2.2% to 147.01. Wynn is now slightly extended from a 139.77 flat-base entry cleared on Sept. 1.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.Curtis said that gaming volumes in Manila continue to increase for Melco. He also said that next year's opening of Morpheus, Melco's new luxury hotel in Macau, would help as well.And Curtis is also less pessimistic about the impact of potential smoking restrictions in Macau casinos set to take hold in 2019. He said market growth and infrastructure, such as a light rail system, could help bolster traffic and demand and counterbalance any deterrent from a smoking ban.Macau, a special administrative region of China and the only place in the nation where gambling is legal, has seen gaming revenue rebound in recent months, but remains susceptible to regulatory scrutiny.RELATED:Caesars Entertainment Shows Market Leadership With Jump To 91 RS RatingThis Casino Giant Breaks Out As Typhoon Can't Stop Macau GamingAs Macau Rebounds, Casinos Eye This Next Possible Gaming Hot Spot

Apple (AAPL) and JPMorgan (JPM) led the half-dozen blue chips striding to powerful gains during the session.XThe Dow Jones industrial average ended 0.4% higher to end just a fraction below the 23,000 mark; it just passed 22,000 in mid-September. The Nasdaq chalked up a 0.3% gain, and the S&P 500 added 0.2%, each knocking off new highs of their own.The session opened on positive footing after much stronger-than-expected producer price data out of China and a forecast from a central bank governor for the economy's growth to hit 7% in the second half of the year. Another boost before the starting bell came from the New York Federal Reserve, which reported its Empire State Manufacturing Survey spiking to 30.2 for October, up from 24.4 for September and trouncing outlooks for a decline.The combination, along with a positive tone headed into the earnings reporting season, left Six Dow industrials names with gains of better than 1%. JPMorgan (JPM) clocked out with a 2% advance, and Goldman Sachs (GS) rose 1.5% ahead of its third quarter report, due out Tuesday morning.Apple rumbled ahead 1.8%, after its recent move to a segmented revenue strategy earned it an upgrade, to overweight, from equal weight, from Keybanc.

125,WYNN,"Almost immediately after the Las Vegas shooting came the calls for ""common sense"" gun control. The quest almost always begins with a reassurance that ""no one wants to take away your guns.""Not everyone read the memo.Nelson Shields, founder of Handgun Control, Inc., the organization that became the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, in a 1976 interview could not have been more clear about his group's goals: ""Our ultimate goal — total control of handguns in the United States — is going to take time. My estimate is from seven to 10 years. The first problem is to slow down the increasing number of handguns being produced and sold in this country. The second problem is to get handguns registered. And the final problem is to make the possession of all handguns and all handgun ammunition — except for the military, policemen, licensed security guards, licensed sporting clubs, and licensed gun collectors — totally illegal.""In 1993, a Los Angeles Times editorial called for the repeal of the Second Amendment: ""You will not feel safe, your children will not be safe, until there are almost no guns on the streets and in homes. No guns, period, except for those held by law enforcement officers and a few others, including qualified hunters and collectors. ... We must, as a nation, move toward a very different model, one that presumptively bars private citizens from owning a firearm unless they can demonstrate a special need and ability to do so. ... We think the time has come for Americans to tell the truth about guns. They are not for us; we cannot handle them. They kill people, our children included. It's time to get rid of them. Period.""Fast-forward to the Las Vegas shooting. The Washington Post columnist Eugene Robinson calls for a gun ""buyback"": ""A real gun debate has to look at that fact: 300 million guns. And we need, you know, to look at what was done in a place like Australia, where they had a gun buyback. And gun control is permissible, according to the Supreme Court. And so if Congress were to decide — it won't happen — were to decide that automatic assault rifles, long guns ... (and) military-style weapons are something that citizens should not have, they should be police and military only, and we're going to buy them back, that would have an impact. ... And that's what the debate ought to be.""Recall that Hillary Clinton, during the 2016 election, also gushed over the allegedly successful Australian gun buyback program: ""Australia had a huge mass killing about 20, 25 years ago. Canada did as well, so did the UK. In reaction, they passed much stricter gun laws. ... The Australian government as part of trying to clamp down on the availability of automatic weapons, offered a good price for buying hundreds of thousands of guns and basically clamped down going forward, in terms of having more of a background check approach — more of a permitting approach.""True, Australia, over 20 years ago, banned semi-automatic and self-loading rifles, as well as self-loading and pump-action shotguns. The government offered up to a one-year grace period during which it would buy back the banned firearms at preset ""market value"" prices, financed by a tax on health insurance. After that, people possessing the banned weapons would be subject to strict penalties, including imprisonment.But did Australia's gun buyback program reduce violent gun crime?No, according to John Lott of the Crime Prevention Research Center. ""Their firearms homicide rate,"" said Lott, ""had been falling for a decade prior to the buyback. It continued falling at the same rate after the buyback. There was no sudden drop, just a fairly constant decline that continued even as gun ownership rose back up to previous levels. The armed robbery rate rose in the first five years after the buyback. After another 10 years, the rate had fallen to pre-buyback levels.""The near-term ""common sense"" goal of the gun controllers is to ban the ""bump stock"" that enabled the shooter to turn a semi-automatic into a fully automatic weapon. Never mind that of the modern mass shootings in America, only one killer used a machine gun: Stephen Paddock. And where was this ""common sense"" when President Barack Obama's ATF approved the bump stock, pronouncing it a part, not a weapon? California has some of the most stringent gun laws in the country, yet has experienced mass shootings, including the San Bernardino shooting in 2015, where 14 were killed.This is not to say that nothing can be done to make a Las Vegas-style shooting more difficult. But most of these things will be done by private actors. Las Vegas hotel/casino owner Steve Wynn, for example, said his Vegas resorts already had additional security measures in place.The ""common sense"" goal of many ""gun control activists"" is not a ban on this or that feature but a ban on civilian ownership of guns.

127,WYNN,"Casino-and-resort giants MGM Resorts International (MGM), Las Vegas Sands (LVS), Wynn Resorts (WYNN), Melco Resorts & Entertainment (MLCO) and Boyd Gaming (BYD) all report second-quarter earnings this week.XThe results come as Las Vegas evolves into a convention city rather than just a gaming one, and appears ready to benefit from a pickup in travel demand in a solid U.S. economy.Meanwhile, Macau, the world's largest gambling hub, has turned out better gaming revenue in recent months, although not always meeting expectations. But the Chinese special administrative region's lucrative, rebounding VIP gaming segment could face more difficult growth prospects later in the year, when compared with that period in 2016. And the area always remains subject to tighter restrictions from China.As a group, casino stocks staged a 21% run in 2016, and climbed about 9% over the past 8 weeks. That allowed the group to maintain a top 20 ranking among the 197 industry groups tracked by IBD, despite the fact that many top stocks in the group were basing. On Tuesday, the group held a strong No. 17 ranking among industries.Estimates: Late Tuesday, Wall Street expects EPS of $1.09, up 2%, on revenue of $1.45 billion, up 37%, according to Zacks Investment Research.Stock: Shares were down 0.2% intraday at 138.31 in the stock market today.Barclays analyst Felicia Hendrix wrote in a research note in June that Wynn was among the biggest gainers from VIP growth in Macau, likely helped by new junket rooms at Wynn Macau. The company is also stepping up attempts to engage mass-market gamblers at Wynn Palace, which Hendrix said had become much busier compared to its opening last summer.Wynn Palace has added on dining options that appeal more to Chinese customers, she wrote, but added that the property was ""still surrounded by construction sites, which somewhat discourages traffic into the property.""Estimates: Las Vegas Sands, which reports Wednesday, is seen growing EPS by 17% to 61 cents, as revenue increases 14% to $3.019 billion.Stock: Shares fell 0.6% to 62.32, retreating from the top of a buy range above a 59.95 cup-with-handle buy point. The chase zone maxes out at 62.95.The company, which gets the vast majority of its revenue in Asia, is trying to expand its VIP business and nongaming sales in Macau.""We continue to believe that LVS is the best positioned for the long term as the mass market should replace VIP as the growth engine,"" Hendrix said. ""New infrastructure is likely to benefit LVS the most as it has the highest inventory of hotel rooms in Macau and a wide variety of nongaming offerings.""In addition, properties like Sands Cotai Central and the Parisian Macao, Zacks said in a note, aren't exclusively gaming facilities and could bring in more money from meetings, conventions, exhibitions and other events.Estimates: On Thursday, Wall Street expects EPS of 29 cents, up 12%, on revenue of $2.659 billion, a 17% increase.Stock: Shares rose 0.25% to 34.08, extended above buy range.Among the big casino players, MGM is the most exposed to Las Vegas and has been the least exposed to Macau. But the company is seen as a leader in Las Vegas' meetings and conventions business.Las Vegas will also be getting a new NFL team — the Oakland Raiders are set to begin playing in a new stadium there in 2020 — and a new highway connecting the city to Phoenix in the years to come.Big hotel-room additions along the Las Vegas Strip in the next few years are also unlikely, Gabelli analyst Adam Trivison said in an IBD story in May, making for an easier competitive landscape. The company also plans to open a new location on Macau's Cotai Strip and has expanded in smaller U.S. cities as well.Estimates: Wall Street expects the company, which reports Thursday and operates casino-resorts in Asia, to report EPS of 20 cents, up from 5 cents a year ago, with revenue climbing 13% to $1.211 billion.Stock: Shares slipped 2.1% to 21.67, working their way through a flat base with a 24.04 buy point.Estimates: On Thursday, EPS is expected to jump 81% to 29 cents, with revenue up 10% to $598 million.Stock: Shares fell 0.1% to 26.17, just below a 26.30 buy point.RELATED:Here's Why Casino Stocks Tumbled On A Trial In MacauCasino Stocks Retreat On Soft June Macau Gaming Revenue

142,WYNN,"Macau gaming revenue rose a better-than-expected 7.4% in September, the second straight year-over-year gain after a 26-month decline, helped by two massive casino openings in the world's No. 1 gambling destination.Las Vegas Sands (LVS) opened the Parisian Macao last month, while Wynn Resorts (WYNN) opened Wynn Palace in August. The casino resorts offer more entertainment and nongaming tourism, with the Parisian including a mock Eiffel tower.Analysts had predicted a Macau gaming revenue of flat to up 5% last month. The new casinos' novelty — and credit extended to high rollers — likely boosted September. There's some concern that growth going forward will be limited.But back at home, are any Macau-heavy casino stocks are worth mulling a wager on? Let's take a look at Las Vegas Sands, Wynn Resorts, MGM Resorts (MGM) and Hong Kong-based Melco Crown Entertainment (MPEL).Las Vegas Sands broke out of a cup-with-handle base with a 51.33 buy point on Aug. 9. A few weeks later, it fell just below the pivot. Then on Sept. 1, when Macau reported August gaming revenue had turned up, Sands stock surged 7%. The next day, Sands stock moved past the 5% buy zone. Shares peaked at a 17-month high of 58.65 on Sept. 16. Since then shares have consolidated, closing at 57.54 on Friday. Shares rose 2.3% to 58.87 at the close on the stock market today, but there's no sound entry point for now.Las Vegas Sands' profit and revenue have been falling for several quarters, though top-line declines have been shrinking for the past five quarters.IBD'S TAKE: In the current market environments, investors should be careful about making new purchases. Stocks tend to move with the market, so every day keep up with the major indexes and leading stocks with The Big Picture, open to nonsubscribers through Oct. 9.Wynn Resorts cleared a 105.79 buy point on Sept. 14, and rose the following day. But two sessions later, Wynn shares fell below the pivot and then continued sliding. On Friday, shares fell more than 3% to 97.42, closing below the 50-day moving average for the first time since Sept. 7. Wynn rose 1.9% to finshed the trading session at 99.28 Monday.Wynn revenue rose 2% in Q2, the first yearly gain since Q2 2014. Earnings per share rose 53% and 45% in the last two quarters, but analysts see EPS declines in Q3 and Q4.MGM Resorts is the least Macau-centric of the big three casino operators. MGM is the top casino operator on the Las Vegas Strip.MGM tried to break out on Sept. 8, but closed just below the 25.39 buy point. MGM moved above the pivot point on Sept. 15 and Sept. 22, but soon faded below 25.39 again. Finally last week shares moved above the entry area and appear to hold. Shares closed at 26.03 on Friday.MGM shares climbed 0.6% to 26.19 at the close Monday, still in buy range.MGM revenue declines have gradually gotten smaller. Q2 EPS rose 76%. Analysts expect a 17% drop in Q3, but then forecast several quarters of strong growth.Melco Crown Entertainment's U.S. shares have been forming a handle in a cup base with a 16.32 buy point. On Thursday, Melco Crown tried to break out, but reversed with the general market. Shares closed Friday at 16.11.Shares rose as high as 16.70 Monday morning, breaking past the entry point again in heavy volume. But the stock retreated and ended the day up 0.9% at 16.26.Melco profit was flat in Q2 after eight straight EPS declines. Analysts expect a 17 % rise for Q3 and 450% in Q4. Revenue rose 17% in Q2 after a 5% gain in Q1 and a 6% fall in Q4 2015.RELATED:MGM, Wynn Resorts Undercut Buy Points As Casino Stocks Fall

143,WYNN,"Many casino stocks slipped on Monday after strengthening for much of the month, with Wynn Resorts (WYNN) among those crossing below buy points intraday.Wynn Resorts fell 4.25% to 103.96 in above-average volume, under a 105.79 buy point of a three-month-old consolidation. The stock had run up from the end of August, crossing into a buy zone without forming a handle or taking some breather first. In the current market environment, investors should be wary of any purchases, but especially stocks that are ripe for a pullback even as they cross pivot points.MGM Resorts (MGM) fell 2% to 24.94, in the stock market today, below a 25.39 buy point of a consolidation begun in August. MGM Resorts had paused before retaking a buy point on Sept. 15. Monday's slide came on higher-than-normal volume.Las Vegas Sands (LVS) retreated 1.7%, still extended from a Sept. 1 breakout. Hong Kong-based Melco Crown Entertainment (MPEL) fell 2.4%, interrupting a climb that had formed the right side of a cup base.IBD'S TAKE: Some casino stocks have been lifted this month on improved gambling revenue trends in Macau, an administrative area of China and a global gambling hub. Gambling revenue in the area increased in August for the first time in more than two years. For a closer look at casino-stock charts, see this story.Meanwhile, two U.S.-focused casinos agreed to merge Monday.Isle of Capri Casinos (ISLE), meanwhile, spiked 30.2% to 22.04 after Eldorado Resorts (ERI) said it would buy the company in a cash and stock deal worth around $1.7 billion.

Now additional applications in infrastructure, health, marketing, restaurants and entertainment are on the horizon.Utility giant Duke Energy (DUK) last year also conducted tests of AeroVironment's drones to see how they might be used for plant upkeep. And AeroVironment, in an earnings call in June, said it was ""under contract"" with a large U.S. railroad company.Drones could also be used to create Wi-Fi hot spots, and AeroVironment has developed technology that enables encrypted communication, said Steve Gitlin, the company's vice president of marketing strategy, communications and investor relations.

153,WYNN,"Las Vegas Sands (LVS) and Wynn Resorts (WYNN) hit new 52-week highs Wednesday afternoon amid continued momentum in global gaming mecca Macau, but the most intriguing big casino stock may be MGM Resorts (MGM).Macau reported two weeks ago that gambling revenue grew 1.1% to $2.4 billion in August, the first increase for China's only legal gambling district since May 2014. Here's a look at how casino stocks are faring.Las Vegas Sands shares rose 3.2% to 58.31, hitting their best levels since April 2015. The stock has been on a strong uptrend since blasting out of a cup-with-handle base at a 51.33 buy point on Sept. 1, after the Macau gaming industry figures came out.Las Vegas Sands has reported several quarters of falling earnings and revenue, but the declines have gotten smaller as Macau stabilized. Analysts expect earnings to grow 10% in 2017, which would be the first annual increase since 2014.Argus bumped up its rating of the casino and resort company to a buy from hold on Wednesday.Las Vegas Sands opened its French-themed Parisian Macao casino report on Sept. 13, expanding its Macau footprint.Wynn Resorts rose 3.4% to 107.25, nudging above a consolidation to hit a 14-month high intraday in heavy volume.Wynn Resorts boasted solid earnings per share gains in the last two quarters, though analysts expect slim declines in the next two quarters. Revenue growth has returned, barely.Wynn opened a new multibillion-dollar Wynn Palace in Macau last month.Annual profit should climb 11% this year and accelerate to 27% in 2017.IBD'S TAKE: Some stocks are clearing buy points amid Wednesday's solid gains. But the market rally is under pressure. New buys are risky in the current market environment. For more guidance on the market direction, read the Stock Market Today or take a free trial to read The Big Picture.MGM Resorts is the least Macau-centric of the big three casinos, though it's certainly benefiting from improving demand there. MGM earnings shot up 76% in the second quarter. EPS is forecast to fall in Q3 but then skyrocket in Q4.MGM shares climbed 1.45% to 25.22, an area that's been a resistance level recently.In a strong market uptrend, MGM would be at or near a proper buy point.

Analysts' Macau gaming forecasts had ranged from a drop of 3% to an increase of 1%.Meanwhile, a strong Chinese manufacturing report is good news for China's economy -- and perhaps Macau's casinos.Las Vegas Sands shares jumped 7.2 to 53.81% in heavy volume on the stock market today, hitting their best levels since late April and back above a 51.33 buy point.

174,WYNN,"After enduring Macau's worst slump ever, casinos in the world's top casino gambling destination -- including Las Vegas Sands (LVS), Wynn Resorts (WYNN), MGM Resorts (MGM) and Melco Crown Entertainment (MPEL) -- could collectively break even in August for the first time in more than two years.Las Vegas Sands stock is already in a buy zone, while Wynn Resorts and MGM are near proper buy zones.Wells Fargo analyst Cameron McKnight said in a report Monday that, based on checks on casinos there through Aug. 14, he estimates total Macau gaming revenue for August will be flat to down 2% on a year-over-year basis. That's better than the consensus of analysts who cover Macau casinos and have called for a 3%-4% drop. By comparison Macau revenue fell 48.6% in February 2015 vs. a year earlier, amid crackdowns on money laundering and smoking. If the upper end of McKnight's forecast is correct, it would be the first month since May 2014 that Macau's gambling revenue hasn't shrunk on a year-over-year basis. Casino stocks have rallied in recent months, as analysts and company executives also forecast the recession in Macau could be nearing an end.Las Vegas Sands CEO Sheldon Adelson said last month that he sees ""signs of stabilization"" in Macau.McKnight is keeping cautious, however. ""We remain on the sidelines on the Macau gaming names as estimates and valuations adjust to a 'new normal' of (1) a weak Chinese economy, and (2) a recovery that is likely to be flatter than prior rebounds, contributing to more muted revenue growth in Macau.""McKnight has market perform (neutral) ratings on Sands, Melco Crown and Wynn. He has an outperform (buy) rating on MGM Resorts, which is huge in Las Vegas and less exposed to Macau than its peers.IBD'S TAKE: Wynn Resorts and Las Vegas Sands are near buy points, and a new report suggests August could be the best month for Macau in years.

175,WYNN,"Wynn Resorts (WYNN), Las Vegas Sands (LVS), MGM Resorts (MGM), Melco Crown Entertainment (MPEL) and other Macau-centric casino operators are seeing signs that the recession there may be nearing an end.Wynn Resorts is among those in the group opening new multi-billion-dollar casinos to welcome back tourists and high roller ""VIP"" gamblers when the expected upturn comes. July year-over-year gross gambling revenue for Macau was down 4.5% to $2.22 billion, slowing from an 8.5% drop in June and a 9.6% decline in June. But Macau officials told Steve Wynn that his new $4.2 billion Wynn Palace resort, scheduled to open by end of the year, will get 150 gaming tables. That's a little more than a third of the number he asked for. The Macau government also set a limit of 1,145 gaming machines for the casino.Wynn Resorts is ""satisfied"" with the table allocation, spokesman Michael Weaver told Bloomberg in an e-mail statement Friday.Lionel Leong, economy and finance secretary for Macau, said in a written statement that the government of the semi-autonomous region on China's southern coast will ""strictly follow"" the principle of allowing a compound annual growth rate of no more than 3% for new tables at casinos until Jan. 1, 2023, a limit meant to prevent overbuilding.IBD'S TAKE: Wynn Resorts has formed a couple of cup bases this year but has failed to break out amid continuing recession in Macau. Investors are expecting a rebound.

July revenues were up 12% vs. June. This was above the trailing five-year average growth rate of around 4%-5% month-over-month for July -- suggesting revenues were up in seasonally adjusted terms.""McKnight maintained his market perform (neutral) rating on Las Vegas Sands, Wynn and MGM Resorts.IBD'S TAKE: Las Vegas Sands is forming the right side of a cup base, its first base this year, with a 54.90 entry point.

McKnight initiated coverage on Red Rock on May 23 with an outperform rating and a 21-24 target price range.Red Rock was founded by Frank Fertitta Jr. in 1976 under the name Station Casinos, went public in 1993 and was taken private again in 2007.Fertitta died in 2009. His son Frank III, now chairman and chief executive, took it public again under the name Red Rock Resorts in April, selling 27 million shares and raising $531 million.Recent history suggests Frank III has a golden touch. He and his brother Lorenzo recently sold Ultimate Fighting Championship, the most successful mixed martial arts franchise, for $4 billion to a group led by talent agency WME-IMG, a record for a sports franchise. It was all the more impressive when you consider the brothers picked up UFC for a mere $2 million in 2001, when it was on the ropes and nearly bankrupt.Red Rock competes directly with regional casino companies like Boyd Gaming (BYD) in Las Vegas and soon with Eldorado Resorts (ERI), based in Reno, Nev.IBD'S TAKE: Red Rock Resorts launched its IPO in late April and has risen a decent 18% since then.

The Treasury yield spread continued to narrow.Intel (INTC) fell as low as 42.69 after a security issue was revealed on its PC and server processors but rallied to close down 3.1% at 44.74.  The security issue could allow hackers to gather sensitive data from the memory of computing devices, but not modify, delete or corrupt data through the exploit, Intel said.

189,WYNN,"Burger chain Wendy's (WEN) reported better-than-expected second-quarter earnings early Wednesday. Jack in the Box (JACK) released fiscal third-quarter earnings after the market close that were even worse than views, though same-store sales topped forecasts.Estimates: A 30% jump in second-quarter earnings per share to 13 cents, as revenue dives 22% to $299 million, according to Zacks Investment Research. Same-store sales were seen up 3.1%, according to Consensus Metrix.Results: Adjusted EPS rose 50% to 15 cents. Sales were $320.3 million. North American same-store sales rose 3.2%.Outlook: Wendy's sees full-year EPS of 45-47 cents. The Zacks consensus is for 47 cents, and that was before Wendy's 2-cent beat in Q2. Wendy's expects 2017 North American same-store to rise 2%-3% with labor costs up 4%. The burger chain still sees $12 billion in sales in 2020.Stock: Shares rose 3.8% to 15.80 in the stock market today. The stock closed Tuesday in a flat base with a 16.76 buy point.Nomura-Instinet analyst Mark Kalinowski suggested in a research note that some mozzarella-related selections — its Fresh Mozzarella Chicken Sandwich or Fresh Mozzarella Chicken Salad — were among Wendy's popular items during the second quarter. As for the third quarter, promotions for Bacon Queso items seem likely to help, he said.Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG), which is testing queso, climbed 0.3% to 334.59.Estimates: Fiscal third-quarter EPS down 2% to $1.05, as revenue dips 2% to $361 million.Results: EPS was 99 cents on sales of $357.8 million.

Comps at Qdoba, its Mexican chain, rose 0.5%, above views for a 0.5% drop.Qdoba's comps gain came as ""as guests responded favorably to menu innovation,"" the restaurant operator said.Outlook: The company sees fiscal fourth-quarter same-store sales flat to down 2% at Jack in the Box systemwide, with company-owned Qdoba comps also flat to down 2%.Shares: Jack in the Box shares rose 2% in after-hours trading. The stock closed down 0.2% to 94.68.Jack in the Box also said that its evaluation of whether Qdoba fits in with the broader company was still ongoing.""Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC continues to assist the company's Board of Directors in its evaluation of potential alternatives with respect to Qdoba, as well as other ways to enhance shareholder value,"" the company said in its earnings release.The company added that there was no guarantee that the evaluation would lead to a transaction. Jack in the Box also said it had set no timeline.When Jack in the Box reported first-quarter results in May, it said it was looking at ""potential alternatives"" regarding Qdoba.""It has become more apparent since then that the overall valuation of the company is being impacted by having two different business models,"" the company said then.The restaurant operator at that time it ""lost ground"" to some rivals during the first quarter, amid an industrywide value-meal war that took some attention away from Jack in the Box's new menu items. Delayed tax refunds and extended rainfall in California also likely kept diners away, the company said then.IBD'S TAKE: To make up for flagging sales, more quick-service chains are turning to mobile ordering and delivery. McDonald's (MCD) closed flat at 154.92. The company on Tuesday said hopes to broaden its restaurant footprint in China to 4,500 locations by 2022, compared to 2,500 today.Burger King parent Restaurant Brands International (QSR) lost 0.8% to 60.70.RELATED:McDonald's Touts Digital Progress; Domino's Falls HardChipotle, Wynn Resorts, U.S. Steel, Hawaiian Earnings TopJack In The Box Beats Views, Eyes 'Potential Alternatives' For QdobaBurger King Parent Restaurant Brands Earnings Top, Sales Miss

191,WYNN,"Yum Brands (YUM) on Thursday reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that topped forecasts early Thursday.XEstimates: Wall Street expects the company, which owns Taco Bell, Pizza Hut and KFC, to report earnings per share of 61 cents, down 19%, with revenue dropping by more than half to $1.412 billion. Same-store sales are seen up 2.2%.The EPS and revenue estimates reflect the spinoff of its China business, now called Yum China (YUMC), late last year.Results: Yum earned 68 cents a share. Revenue was $1.45 billion. Same-store sales rose 2% worldwide. Pizza Hut's global same-store sales fell 1% in Q2 vs. Taco Bell's 4% gain and KFC's 3% advance.Stock: Shares sank 2.4% to 74.78 on the stock market today. Yum hit a record high on Wednesday.Before the results, Nomura-Instinet analyst Mark Kalinowski raised his full-year EPS forecast on the company. Taco Bell, he said, continued to stand out by virtue of ""not being a burger brand,"" and efforts to keep its menu fresh.Among those efforts? Naked Chicken Chips — that is, seasoned white-meat chicken, in chip form, with nacho cheese sauce. Kalinowski said the promotional push for those chips during the quarter appeared to pay off.Meanwhile, he said, results out of Pizza Hut will likely be uninspiring through the rest of the year, as rivals Domino's Pizza (DPZ) and Papa John's (PZZA) pull ahead of the industry with delivery technology.But he appreciated some of the company's recent efforts: Pizza Hut last month said it had developed a ""proprietary delivery network algorithm"" that can predict delivery times while factoring in weather, traffic, construction and other things that might affect a pizza's journey to a customer's doorstep. Kalinowski also said he expected Pizza Hut to launch a loyalty program sometime this year.Papa John's (PZZA) last month announced that customers could order food via Facebook (FB). Papa John's shares jumped Tuesday after the company a day earlier announced a $500 million hike in its buyback plan and said it would raise its leverage ratio, even though it reported second-quarter North American same-store sales that missed expectations.RELATED:McDonald's Touts Digital Progress; Domino's Falls HardBurger King Parent Restaurant Brands Earnings Top, Sales MissChipotle, Wynn Resorts, U.S. Steel, Hawaiian Earnings Top

192,WYNN,"Las Vegas Sands (LVS), MGM Resorts International (MGM), Wynn Resorts (WYNN) and other Macau-centric casinos aren't out of the woods yet.Gambling revenue for Macau, the world's top casino destination, fell in June. That marks the 25th month in a row revenue has fallen, despite earlier signs that the recession there may be nearing an end.Macau officials said total gambling revenue for the special administrative district on China's southern coast fell 8.5% in June vs. the same month a year ago to about $2 billion, worse than the 6.6% drop that many analysts expected. Shares of Las Vegas Sands closed up 0.5% at 43.71 in the stock market today. Sands dropped to a 3-1/2 year low at 34.88 on Jan. 20 of this year and then turned up on glimmers of possible recovery in Macau, where it and other Las Vegas Casinos operate multi-billion-dollar casino resorts. As of Friday midday it was up about 26% from that low point.MGM rose 0.7%, while Wynn Resorts climbed 1.3%. Hong Kong-based Melco Crown Entertainment (MPEL) added 2.5%.Wells Fargo analyst Cameron McKnight said Macau's June revenue was 14% lower than May, two percentage points below the average 12% drop from May to June. He forecasts that Macau gambling revenue will decline 8%-10% in July vs. a year earlier, worse than consensus for a milder 5.8% drop.With Macau-centric casino stocks up 2% so far this year, ""we believe many investors are taking the view that Macau revenues have stabilized, vs. our view that additional regulation and new supply could weigh on (second-half) results,"" McKnight said.Macau went into recession a little more than two years ago amid weakening economic growth in China and the imposition of tough regulations by the Chinese government as part of a nationwide crackdown on corruption.The rate of revenue decline slowed earlier this year from the 20%-plus year-over-year drops seen in the early part of the recession, leading some market watchers to say the worst may be over in Macau. McKnight says that may be a bit premature.Wynn and Sands have confirmed plans to open new casinos in Macau in the third quarter. Wynn Palace is expected to open on Aug. 22 and Sands' Parisian in mid-September. That will boost the number of casinos and gaming lounges in Macau to nearly 50, according to the World Casino Directory, at a time when fewer tourists and high rollers are visiting the region.McKnight noted that, according to the Supreme People's Court in China, bankruptcies soared 52.5% in first quarter 2016 vs. the same quarter a year ago, to 1,028. That's 44% higher than the average quarterly case total over the past seven years amid weakened economic growth in China.Additionally, reports last week suggested that China's central bank is considering allowing a fall in the yuan to as low as 6.8 per dollar.""We note that a weaker Chinese currency would reduce mainland gamblers' purchasing power in Macau given the MOP (Macau currency) is pegged to the dollar, not the yuan,"" McKnight said.

194,WYNN,"Las Vegas officially has its first professional sports team after the National Hockey League decided to gamble on Vegas. On Thursday, the league's board of governors unanimously approved the 31st NHL team.Las Vegas Sands (LVS) CEO Sheldon Adelson immediately said he  wants to up the ante and bring a pro football team to the city as well.Getting the NHL team is expected to boost revenue and profits for Las Vegas Sands, MGM Resorts International (MGM), Wynn Resorts (WYNN), Caesars Entertainment (CZR) and other casino resorts there.The new hockey team will begin playing at the at T-Mobile Arena, which has a hockey seating capacity of 17,500 in 2017. It means more people staying at their hotels, attending other entertainment events, eating at casino restaurants, shopping at their stores and gambling in their casinos.Wells Fargo analyst Cameron McKnight said in a report that the new Las Vegas NHL team will increase the number of events held at the arena by 30% to 35% a year, ""potentially driving up to 600,000 new visitors to the arena."" McKnight didn't speculate on how much money it could bring to the city.For Vegas casinos, it could help offset ongoing losses in Macau, the world's top casino gambling destination, on China's southern coast. Macau has been in recession for two years and Vegas casinos, which own the bulk of properties in Macau, have seen their revenue and profits there shrink.Las Vegas has tried in vain for years to get a pro sports team but met with resistance from sports leagues that didn't want to tie pro sports to gambling.Geoff Freeman, president of the American Gaming Association, said in a commentary in CDC Gaming Reports that the NHL team could open the door to other sports teams in Las Vegas and change people's perceptions regarding professional sports and gambling.""Most significantly, by breaking the Las Vegas dam, the NHL is pouring cold water on the argument that regulated sports betting harms the integrity of sports -- and boosting efforts to legalize sports betting across the country,"" Freeman said.Shares of Sands, the world's largest casino company, fell 60% from an all-time high at 88.28 in early March 2014 to a bottom at 34.88 on Jan. 20 of this year before turning up amid signs the recession in Macau may be nearing an end.

195,WYNN,"The new federal jobs report has good news. America's economy created about 215,000 new jobs in March, helping to keep the national unemployment rate at a healthy 5%.Unfortunately, there's one group that has been almost completely left out of this recovery: high school dropouts. Nearly 60% still can't find a job or have simply stopped looking.Dropping out of high school doesn't just happen. Almost always, those who don't receive a diploma come from low-income households with parents who didn't go to college. These students start out so far behind that they don't have a real shot at catching up.Fortunately, there's new legislation that, if properly implemented, could help propel these students ahead, thus lifting America's graduation rate even higher and boosting the number of students who go on to college and join the high-skilled labor force.Passed at the end of last year in a rare moment of bipartisan enthusiasm, the ""Every Student Succeeds Act"" -- or ESSA -- is the first federal education bill in over a decade. It provides states with new resources to invest in proven approaches that help at-risk students succeed. State officials need to take full advantage of this funding.Democrats love ESSA. It expands preschool programs, flexibility in standardized testing, and targeted interventions for chronically underperforming schools and students.But so do Republicans, chiefly because it devolves power to the states. Previous versions of federal education legislation expanded federal control over America's public education system. ESSA reverses that trend and gives states much greater leeway in how they spend federal dollars.In particular, states can now freely deploy federal funding for what are called ""integrated student supports."" These are, essentially, in-school social services.Schools that embrace integrated student supports hire social workers to identify at-risk students, provide them with specialized counseling and help them get food, health care, school supplies and other basics.Students from low-income households are uniquely ill-equipped for school. For instance, disadvantaged kids usually enter school with severely limited vocabularies. By the sixth grade, they have a 6,000-hour deficit in enrichment time spent with caring adults.Integrated student supports tackle such problems directly. These programs, which serve students in nearly 3,000 elementary and high schools across the country, have a proven track record. Some have improved graduation rates by over 90%.Helping at-risk high schoolers graduate can transform their lives.Consider Alexis, a student at the University of Texas at San Antonio. By the time she entered fifth grade at a Texas public school, her family had moved nearly 20 times. Her father battled alcoholism. Her mother had problems finding steady work.At the encouragement of a trusted teacher, Alexis was connected with her local Communities In Schools affiliate, the primary provider of integrated student supports -- serving 1.5 million students each year. With intense tutoring, she was able to graduate on time and earn admission at the University of Texas at San Antonio, where she's studying to be an orthodontist.She has a bright future. If she'd dropped out, her professional opportunities would have dimmed considerably, and she'd have a much harder time escaping the poverty into which she was born.High school dropouts also cost society. Nine in 10 welfare recipients -- and 3 in 4 food stamp recipients -- didn't complete high school. Dropping out correlates highly with smoking, obesity, chronic illness, teen pregnancy, homelessness, incarceration and early death. All come with a very real cost to regular citizens.ESSA doesn't force any districts to embrace integrated student supports. The law provides finances and flexibility so state lawmakers and education officials can find local, community solutions to help the poorest and most powerless.It empowers them to build on past progress and adopt new programs to offer all students a pathway out of poverty, without federal meddling.I've witnessed first-hand how education improves outcomes. At the two hospitality companies I helped launch -- Mirage Resorts and Wynn Resorts -- many entry-level positions went to those who graduated high school but didn't make it to college.Many were able to excel at their jobs, of course, and the most ambitious would then return to school and bring back the skills they needed to move up the management chain.Every American deserves the chance to succeed, regardless of birth status. With ESSA, states have been afforded the resources and freedom to make sure every child has that chance.Expanding integrated student supports will drive down the dropout rate even further and secure a bright future for at-risk students across the country.

196,WYNN,"Gaming revenue from Macau this month could see its first annual growth in two years, an analyst said, potentially providing some relief for Las Vegas Sands (LVS), MGM Resorts International (MGM), Wynn Resorts (WYNN) and Hong Kong-based Melco Crown Entertainment (MPEL).Union Gaming analyst Grant Govertsen said in a report that the worst is nearly over in Macau, and that June gross gambling revenue (GGR) could be in line with the daily rate of around $72.46 million that's been reported in recent non-holiday months.""This would result in total GGR of $2.2 billion and would represent the first year-over-year increase in GGR after 24 months of declines,"" Govertsen said.Govertsen expects Macau's gambling revenue in July and August to see mid-single-digit declines before returning to growth in September.""We feel better about fall GGR trends generally staying in the black simply because the two properties likely to come online in this period -- Wynn Palace and Parisian Macao” -- have potential to drive further growth, he said.Shares of Las Vegas Sands, the world's largest casino company, closed up 0.3% in the stock market today. MGM Resorts rallied 2.5% to 23.42, near a 23.44 buy point, and Wynn Resorts rose 0.6% as it forms a cup base with a 102.54 buy point. Melco Crown fell 1%.Wells Fargo analyst Cameron McKnight said in a note to clients that he remains on the sidelines on Macau gaming names, as the region ""adjusts to a 'new normal' of (1) a weak Chinese economy, and (2) a recovery that is likely to be flatter than prior rebounds.""McKnight forecasts a 1%-7% decline for June vs. a year ago, with the midpoint a bit better than analyst consensus for a 3.7% drop.But May was a ""really tough calendar comp"" that saw two fewer weekend days for the month compared to a year earlier, Govertsen noted.Macau's Gaming Inspection and Coordination Bureau reported 18.39 billion Macau patacas ($2.3 billion) gambling revenue from all casinos for the month, down 9.6% from a year before. It was worse than expectations for an 8% drop, as well as lagging April's 9.5% decline.

The combination has been good for the stock market, partly because the prospect of low interest rates has weighed on the dollar, which could be a boon to the earnings of U.S. multinationals in the second half of this year.The decision by the Fed to wait until September to announce a shift in its reinvestment policy — a gradual pullback from its current stance of reinvesting all principal from its maturing mortgage and Treasury bond portfolio — also sent a signal that policymakers aren't overly concerned that financial markets are too exuberant.The next interest-rate hike is expected in December.

That's was likely largely due to booming memory chips, but also possibly good sales for the Samsung Galaxy 8 smartphone.Yum China (YUMC) topped earnings but fell short on sales. The spin-off and China licensee of Yum Brands (YUM), which owns KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell, highlighted its mobile and delivery sales, which have become more important to attracting tech-savvy, convenience-seeking diners. Mobile payments surpassed 40% of sales during the quarter; delivery made up 13%. Yum China also said it had acquired a controlling interest in the holding company of the delivery service Daojia. Yum China shares tumbled 12.9% on Thursday but pared its week loss to 5.35%.Delta Air Lines (DAL) said Q2 unit revenue would land in the upper range of its outlook and tweaked higher its operating-margin forecast. The carrier said ""an improving revenue environment"" helped counterbalance the scores of cancellations it suffered in April because of powerful thunderstorms in the Atlanta area.Casino stocks pulled back on softer-than-expected Macau gaming revenue for June. Gross gaming revenue rose 25.9% to 20 billion patacas ($2.49 billion), short of the midpoint of forecasts for 23%-33%, according to Reuters, marking the 11th consecutive month of casino revenue growth in the wake of the Chinese government's corruption crackdown. MGM Resorts International (MGM) lost 1.4% for the week after tumbling nearly 5% on June 30.

Worldpay said it selected the Vantiv offer over one from by JPMorgan Chase (JPM), which said it did not intend to make a counteroffer. Vantiv generates the bulk of its revenue from fees associated with payment-processing services for merchants. Clients include Wal-Mart (WMT), Target (TGT) and Macy's (M).Bankrate (RATE) shares jumped after the online provider of financial services for consumers agreed to be acquired for $1.4 billion by Red Ventures, a privately held internet advertising and media company.General Electric tumbled 3.8% on Thursday to a 21-month low after JPMorgan saw an uncertain and limited outlook for the industrial giant, while the European Union accused GE of not disclosing information during a merger review.Shares of O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY) plunged 19% to 178.77 Wednesday after the retailer announced same-store sales grew 1.7% in the second quarter, well short of expectations.

208,WYNN,"The gain by Apple (AAPL) in above-average turnover on Tuesday following a sharp two-session sell-off, plus rallies by a large number of cyclical areas of the stock market, appeared to suggest that the bull run is not dead yet.Transportation, part of the cyclical sector, is rallying today with the Dow Jones transports up nearly 0.5%. In the mobile home and RV space, Cavco Industries (CVCO) (97 EPS Rating) survived a wild open to rally more than 9% to 129.80, rising more than 6% past a new flat base with a 121.80 buy point. The manufactured home specialist reported a 55% jump in fiscal fourth-quarter earnings to $1.19 a share, smashing the consensus estimate by more than 16%, on a 12% pickup in sales to $198 million.On Friday, IBD's current outlook for U.S. equities was downgraded to ""Uptrend under pressure"" from ""Confirmed uptrend"" after the Nasdaq composite suffered a 1.8% drop in sharply higher volume, a telltale sign of unusually heavy professional selling. Over the past 25 sessions, the Nasdaq has encountered three such days of what IBD calls distribution, including a 2.6% slide on May 17.Yet for now, the uptrend remains in place, and investors can cautiously buy new breakouts with the knowledge that downside risk is elevated. In fact, as IBD's The Big Picture column has noted over the years, breakouts that occur late in a run-up tend to show a higher rate of stumbling.The current market uptrend really caught fire after the Nov. 8 U.S. elections. Since then, the Nasdaq has rallied more than 25%, a solid gain amid its nine-year rally that began with the March 2009 bottom.On Tuesday, the Nasdaq composite led the key averages with a closing gain of just over 0.7%. The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average posted gains of 0.4% to 0.5% each. Volume fell sharply vs. Monday, according to preliminary data.As seen in the daily chart PDF accompanying IBD's Big Picture column, the Nasdaq composite now has an Accumulation/Distribution Rating of C, which is neutral, but the S&P 500 sports a B grade and the Dow industrials a B+. A grade of B- or higher suggests that institutional investors are on net accumulating stock.Keep in mind that although the Dow has a better Accumulation rating than the Nasdaq, it is lagging the latter index in terms of year-to-date gains, up less than 8%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite is up nearly 15%. Yet on the Dow 30, 16 names have an individual Accumulation/Distribution Rating of B- or better. See this rating and others at IBD Stock Checkup. Apple, up nearly 1% to 146.59 in heavy turnover, is up more than 24% from a recent breakout at 118.12 and continues to act like a market leader because its drop below the 50-day moving average was not that deep. The megacap tech and Dow 30 component is now just a few points below the 50-day line (currently near 148.64) and paring losses.IBD's TAKE: In the fourth quarter of 2016, Apple formed a bottoming base, a bullish chart pattern. Early-stage bases give an investor better odds of making money. Learn more about this pattern and other bullish bases at Investor's Corner.IBD Chairman Bill O'Neil has said frequently that a top market leader in fundamentals, stock-price action and fund sponsorship that falls below the 50-day or 10-week line should continue to be watched if it does not sink through the key support level in the heaviest volume since the start of the move.As seen in a daily chart, Apple's volume in the two recent down days do not exceed the 112 million-share day on Feb. 1 after the iPhone maker reported a clear turnaround in the top and bottom lines. Apple broke out of an early-stage cup with handle at 118.12 on Jan. 6-9.Apple is forecast to grow earnings in FY 2017, ending in September, by 8% to $8.94 a share, then accelerate profits with an 18% jump in FY 2018. That latter estimate seems to bake in expectations of a strong product replacement cycle when the next iPhone comes out, likely in the fall of this year.Apple's revenue growth is back on track as well; the top line rose 3% to $78.4 billion in the fiscal first quarter ended in December and 5% to $52.9 billion in Q2 (ended in March). The Street sees further revenue growth in Q3 (up 6%) and Q4 (up 8%), helping fuel EPS increases of 11% and 13% in the same periods.In the prior four periods, Apple's profit dropped 23% and 15%, then turned around with gains of 2% and 11% vs. year-ago levels.Elsewhere in the stock market today, economically sensitive issues are pacing the market's upside, including RV makers, automakers, oil drilling, ship transport and agricultural chemical producers. But water utility, gold, dairy product and gaming companies are also showing gains of well more than 1%.Burland East, manager of the Altegris/AACA Opportunistic Real Estate mutual fund, told IBD that he sees very attractive opportunities in companies that have a large exposure to Macau because gaming-related revenue in the region has seen midteen growth in Q1 and Q2, a nice turnaround from what he sees as the bottom in the third quarter of last year.""The pressures from the Chinese government have pulled back a bit, and it appears a new low has been set (in terms of business there),"" East said. ""For those with a five-year investment horizon, we think Macau will be very attractive.""Indeed, Las Vegas Sands (LVS) and Wynn Resorts (WYNN) have been market outperformers in 2017, so far up nicely since recent breakouts at 59.95 and 104.49, respectively. Wynn on Tuesday added 3% to 134.16. The stock has yet to touch its rising 50-day moving average since surpassing the proper cup-with-handle entry in mid-March.Las Vegas Sands, up nearly 1.5% to 64.87, has now advanced 8% past the proper buy point. On the daily chart, notice how the stock had traded on the north side of its 50- and 200-day moving average lines while finishing its nearly six-month cup with handle.The best cup bases tend to show declines from head to toe of 12% to no more than 33%. A milder decline means that a stock has less work to do to rally back near its highs before potentially breaking out.Also, in Sands' cup with handle, the drop from the handle's high of 59.85 to its low of 56.33 was a mere 6%, less than the typical maximum allowed decline of 8% to 12%. Add 10 cents to the high of the handle to determine the exact buy point.As of March 31, East's $151 million Opportunistic Real Estate fund shows a 10.9% net exposure in the gaming sector.RELATED:Apple News: It's Confirmed; Apple Is Going Into The Driving Tech FieldInvestor's Corner: How To Spot Major Market Tops The Easy WayIs Apple Near A New Buy Zone?Top-Performing Companies In The Sector Leaders: How Are They Doing?

Last month, Macau's Gaming Inspection and Coordination Bureau (DICJ) said it would increase its audits of the junket industry. Junkets bring high rollers to casinos with offers of credit and later settle any debts. They account for 53% of total casino revenue from Macau.Earlier Macau had tried to limit ATM withdrawals and require facial-recognition technology at ATMs in another attempt to stop money laundering.RELATED:How An NFL Team, A Highway And Towels Benefit MGM Resorts

213,WYNN,"The drive to legalize online sports betting for money may get a boost this year as the Nevada Gaming Commission gets set to consider a process that would effectively legalize it nationally -- with restrictions.The proposed legislation would radically change the U.S. gambling environment and could draw the attention of casino giants such as Las Vegas Sands (LVS), MGM Resorts International (MGM) and Wynn Resorts (WYNN).They offer on-premise sports betting in their casinos and would likely participate in online gambling if it becomes widely legalized. So could smaller Las Vegas-based casino operators like Pinnacle Entertainment (PNK) and Boyd Gaming (BYD). The top casinos already offer apps for in-state online gambling in states that allow it.So far, only four states have legalized sports betting for money, whether online or in casinos: Nevada, Oregon, Delaware and Montana. But it's mainly confined to Nevada.Quinton Singleton, vice president and deputy general counsel at gaming technology company CG Technology, in February submitted a proposal to the Nevada Gaming Commission to amend the state's gambling regulations to allow betters in all 50 states to set up and fund mobile sports-betting apps. CG Technology's products include Alphabet (GOOGL)-owned Google Android- and Apple (AAPL)-compatible smartphone apps.It's not clear when the gaming commission will take up the proposal.The proposed rules would also simplify registering for online gambling, Legal Sports Report said, citing comments by Singleton. The report said the Nevada Gaming Commission could consider the proposal as early as this year.The proposed amended rules would only allow certain types of sports betting and would require a difficult registration process. Potential betters would have to complete a one-time in-person verification step at a Nevada-based sports book or casino. And betting on single game sports events would still not be permitted outside the state of Nevada.Las Vegas Sands, the world's biggest casino company, has seen its earnings-per-share growth contract for five quarters in a row amid a nearly two-year-long recession in Macau. Sands and other top casino companies operate billion-dollar-plus casino resorts in the gambling hot spot on China's southern coast. Sands shares, which have a weak IBD Composite Rating of 30 out of a best-possible 99, fell 1.2% to 44.96 in the stock market today.Wynn fell 3.4%, MGM Resorts rose fractionally, Pinnacle slid 2.6% and Boyd Gaming was up 0.3%.

214,WYNN,"In April, Steve Wynn announced plans to tear up the golf course that lies behind two of his Las Vegas hotels and replace it with a 38-acre man-made lake, about the size of 30 American football fields. Rising from the middle of the lagoon, Wynn said during a recent conference call, will be a 10-story mountain, accessible by zip line and electric ferry, that will serve as a launching point for nightly fireworks.Wynn will bring the pyrotechnics. The water comes courtesy of Crystal Lagoons, a Miami-based company that licenses technology for what is either the greatest real estate amenity since running water or the most chimerical since the Fountain of Youth.The company was founded a decade ago by real estate developer Fernando Fischmann. Frustrated by rough Pacific Ocean tides that made the coastline too dangerous for swimming, he developed technology for cleaning large bodies of water as part of his plan to build an oceanfront community in his native Chile. Today, the company boasts 60 lagoons in operation and says an additional 250 are in development from Singapore to Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt. The company plans to open offices in Dallas and Los Angeles as it seeks to seal 40 U.S. deals by the end of the year.Selling clear-water lakes to real estate developers is just a ripple on the surface of Fischmann's ambitions. He said he's working with students at MIT’s Sloan School of Management on a business model for building lagoons in public parks and is hatching plans to build ""floating lagoons"" on top of bodies of water that are currently unsuitable for swimming. His most audacious proposal is a system to cool an electric power plant and use the excess heat to power a desalination facility.The dream is ""to produce a huge impact,” Fischmann said. “Freshwater production is probably the most important problem facing the world.""Getting power companies to embrace the technology may take time, Fischmann said. In the meanwhile, a Boston Consulting Group study commissioned by Crystal Lagoons shows demand for 14,000 artificial lakes around the world.“You will see people taking the subway with swimming suits and sandals and going to the beach somewhere in the city,” Fischmann said.You can’t treat a mile-long lake as you would an oversize swimming pool and simply dump in a lot of chlorine. Fischmann, who trained as a biochemist, developed a system for monitoring the water chemistry in real time and delivering chemicals in tactical strikes on an as-needed basis. The company uses a special film to minimize evaporation and applies a UV coating on the bottom of the pools to tint them blue.The lakes, which cost about $250,000 an acre to build, require a fraction of the water needed to keep a golf course green. The company licenses its technology to developers in return for a single-digit percent of the project sales. Fischmann wouldn’t say how much money he’s making (he also withheld his age and other personal information), but said he recently insured the company’s intellectual property for more than $2 billion.""I think that people will like that it’s clear and clean and beautiful to look at,"" said Jackie Soffer, co-chairman of Turnberry Associates, which is building two 10-acre pools using Crystal Lagoons technology at SoLe Mia, a $4 billion mixed-use project her company is codeveloping in Miami with LeFrak Organization. Beyond the visual appeal, Soffer hopes the lakes will help developers woo more active homebuyers in a market saturated with golf courses.""I think people will swim or sail,"" Soffer said. ""This being South Florida, we'll probably have people doing yoga on paddleboards.""Power companies might be a harder sell.Most power plants, whether they depend on coal, natural gas or nuclear energy, produce electricity by making steam and using it to drive giant turbines. In the old days, plants were built near major bodies of water, which were then diverted through the plant, cooling the condenser and heating the water before dumping it back. These ""once-through"" systems are bad for aquatic life, says John Rogers, senior energy analyst at the Union of Concerned Scientists. That's one reason they gave way to ""closed"" cooling systems in the 1970s. Still, as of 2011, more than 30% of U.S. power plants used once-through systems.Fischmann’s solution is to create such vast reservoirs that he can cool plants with water that passes by condensers in pipes, limiting evaporation. In 2014, a subsidiary of the Italian utility Enel tested Fischmann's technology to cool a power plant outside Santiago. The four-month experiment, funded by a Chilean economic development agency, proved that the ""technology could be applied in any thermal plant,"" according to the power company. For his next trick, Fischmann wants to use the heat transferred to water via the cooling process to power a desalination plant.Ultimately, the challenge is not only to create a better method for cooling, but to make it cost-effective to implement, said Eric Toone, a physical organic chemist who directs Duke University’s Innovation and Entrepreneurship Initiative. “That’s always the problem in energy (not will it work from a technical perspective -- that’s easy): Can you do it on a gigawatt scale and still produce power for eight cents a kilowatt?”Related:Food Feeds Real-Estate Development In Edgy AreasDevelopers Rehab Rust Belt Relics Into Luxury HotelsClean Energy Cultivates Farmland Leases As Crop Revenue Withers

However, he cautioned that there is still risk. Recent data points to improvement but most analysts don't expect growth to return until end of this year or next year.Meanwhile, MGM priced its real estate investment trust initial public offering on Tuesday and began trading on Wednesday, a sign that the dormant IPO market may be stirring.MGM Growth Properties (MGP) priced 50,000 shares at $21 per share, at the top of its expected $18 to $21 range, raising $1.05 billion.

225,WYNN,"Wynn Resorts' (WYNN) head Steve Wynn unveiled plans for a water park next to his Las Vegas hotels, complete with a lake, mile-long white sand beach with boardwalk and a nightly fireworks display -- putting yet another twist on what hotel-casino operators will do to get an edge in America's gambling capital.In what the company referred to as a ""recreational lake concept,"" the attraction will tentatively be called Wynn Paradise Park and is estimated to cost about $1.6 billion. The park will be constructed behind the company's two properties, the Wynn and Encore hotels, on what is now a 130-acre golf course operated by the company.In addition to the beach-front attractions, the park will offer water skiing, paddle boarding and parasailing. The nightly fireworks display will be launched from a small island in the center of the park's lake. Wynn also is planning to build a 1,000-room hotel on the site.Wynn shares gapped up 11.7%, closing at 99.99 on the stock market today. The stock dropped to an intraday low at 49.95 on Jan. 14 then turned up. In the intervening three months, it's shot up about 96%, trading above both its 10-week and 200-day lines.Wynn's plan is a new strategy for an industry that will do just about anything to attract families and visitors along with gamblers to Vegas. While other hotel-casinos have tried to attract families with everything from exotic big cats to medieval jousting to a replica of the Eiffel Tower, this is the first attempt to replicate, well, a day at the beach.""We could bring beach life to Las Vegas,"" Wynn told investors in a call on Wednesday. ""And we could charge admission to come into Paradise Park, which is what it’s going to be called, I hope.""Telsey Advisory Group analyst David Katz wrote in a note Thursday that the golf course brings in about $5 million in adjusted earnings. Paradise Park, meanwhile, could bring in $300 million to $400 million, Katz wrote.Katz said he saw the project as a ""shrewd move on the part of (Wynn) to unlock further value from the land."" He upgraded Wynn's stock to outperform from market perform and raised its price target to 112 from 67.It's unclear how Wynn competitors -- such as MGM Resorts International (MGM), and the world's largest casino resort company Las Vegas Sands (LVS) -- will respond to this move.

243,WYNN,"Las Vegas is getting an NFL team, gaming revenue is returning to Macau, and economic improvements in both China and the U.S. are bringing people back to the casino table.For a sprawling resort operator like MGM Resorts International (MGM), whose hotels, convention spaces and casinos line the streets Macau, Vegas, and increasingly in other U.S. cities, things could be worse.""Usually when you see those kinds of factors taking place, that bodes well for our industry as a whole,"" MGM Chief Financial Officer Dan D'Arrigo told Investor's Business Daily.In Las Vegas, MGM has more exposure in the city than any other rival. Thus, the company stands to gain as more businesses attend conventions, gamers attend ""League of Legends"" tournaments, tourists plot their buffet strategy and people come from L.A. to party or blow their savings from behind poker sunglasses.""MGM is the best positioned operator to capture the growing trends in Las Vegas and faces many growth catalysts over the next few years that should generate stock price appreciation,"" Barclays analyst Felicia Hendrix said in a recent note to clients.Those catalysts were likely on display when the company reported strong first-quarter earnings last month. It was helped by Vegas, Macau, the December opening of MGM National Harbor outside Washington, D.C., and the company's moves to bring Atlantic City, N.J.-based Borgata, under its umbrella. Management said it remained optimistic about the ""market's recent uptick"" in lucrative VIP gaming.And in Macau, now the world's biggest gambling hot spot and the only place in China where it's legal, MGM plans to open a location this year on the casino-gilded Cotai Strip, its second in the region. The extra location, loaded with some 1,400 hotel rooms as well as spas and meeting spaces, would help the company offset some of the regulatory crackdown there, analysts say.""There is a VIP rally underway in Macau,"" Telsey Advisory Group analyst David Katz told IBD.The casino glare tends to divert attention from an ongoing shift in Las Vegas' economy on which MGM has capitalized. That is the evolution away from the casino business toward hospitality, making the city one of the premiere destinations for conventions.MGM already controls much of the Las Vegas Strip. Gabelli & Co. estimated in an October research report that MGM and Caesars Entertainment (CZR) owned 70% of hotel rooms there and accounted for the same slice of the area's net sales. Rivals Las Vegas Sands (LVS), Wynn Resorts (WYNN) and others control the rest, Gabelli said.""MGM has pulled away as a clear leader in the (meetings and conventions) category with its expansion at Mandalay Bay and forthcoming expansion of Aria,"" Gabelli analyst Adam Trivison wrote in the report, referring to two of the company's casino resort properties. The company's larger operations dedicated to bringing in group businesses have helped on that front, he said in an interview with IBD.And in March, NFL owners OK'd the Oakland Raiders' plans to move to Las Vegas, where the team is set to begin playing in a new $1.9 billion stadium in 2020. Bringing a big sports franchise could shore up business across the city on slower weekends and during the holidays, Trivison said.But there's a particular benefit for MGM: Plans, as of now, would put the stadium along I-15 — right across from MGM's Mandalay Bay Resort.""Everyone wins,"" Trivison wrote in another recent research note, ""especially MGM.""A new highway linking Las Vegas and Phoenix, Interstate 11, could also decongest travel between the two expanding cities once complete. The two metro areas had been the largest adjacent U.S. cities not connected by freeway, and this move could bring more gamblers to Vegas from the southeast. Construction is still in the early phases.Meanwhile, Trivison estimates, there won't be any significant new hotel-room additions to the Las Vegas Strip for potentially three years, keeping new competition at bay for MGM and giving them more control over prices.IBD'S TAKE: In late April, MGM broke out of a flat base that lasted nearly five months and is now hovering in a buy range in the low 30s. MGM has a highest-possible IBD Composite Rating of 99 and is the top-ranked stock in the Leisure-Gaming Equipment sector.The shoring up of fundamentals comes as the industry, once populated by an array of smaller casino operators, has consolidated over the years. Along the way, it has also taken a more sophisticated, analytics-oriented approach to measuring business trends.MGM Resorts International — the product of a sandwiching-together of the legacy MGM business, Mirage and Mandalay — is no exception. The company has gotten better at watching costs and invested in technology that can gauge customer demand and labor needs.MGM's profit growth plan has helped. Under that plan, begun in mid-2015, the company carried out scores of initiatives, including tying its businesses together. It even made sure more of its properties all carried the same kinds of towels.""There was a view that the company could be improved,"" Katz said. ""They were leaving money on the table.""Even as MGM works to keep Wall Street happy, the industry faces a bigger, generational problem: how to keep the younger people coming into Vegas happy as well amid concerns they're not yet interested in gambling.D'Arrigo says Baby Boomers are still MGM's ""bread and butter"" customer. While he said millennials weren't shy about buying bottle service and dropping thousands at a venue in Vegas, they were more interested in the social component of gaming.""We've seen that more with the millennials than we do them sitting down at a three-reel slot machine at video poker,"" he said.The gaming industry, including MGM, has also begun tinkering with technology that allows people to gamble away from the casino floor, perhaps by the pool but not off-premise completely.Seeking to tap the growing popularity of e-sports, MGM's Mandalay Bay Events Center last year also hosted a ""League of Legends"" tournament. It also plans to host Evo 2017 World Finals, the fighting-game tournament, in July. And the company plans to turn a nightclub at its Luxor property into an e-Sports arena, potentially next year.The industry also is experimenting with so-called ""skill-based"" games, first approved in the U.S. last year. Those games function like the shooters or pinball games found on consoles or at arcades, except a player places a bet and gets paid according to how well they do.Trivison says it could take time before the industry develops games that effectively juggle the length of a turn at a game, payout and profitability. And he said it would be difficult to create something as profitable as the slot-heavy regional casinos of decades past.""What business can you think of where people will literally come into your place and drop money into a machine and walk out?"" Trivison said.MGM also has widened its exposure to parts of the U.S. outside of Vegas — with locations like MGM Grand Detroit and National Harbor. The company also plans to open a location in Springfield, Mass., in the second half of next year.Sales from those locations are unlikely to match those in Vegas, and newer, smaller markets can be harder for a casino operator to predict, Telsey's Katz says. Even as Detroit and Springfield pick up the pieces after years of struggle, Katz says locations in smaller cities can turn customers on to MGM's bigger resorts in Las Vegas.That may be helpful, since China is seeking to to curb the flow of cash from its borders. Ultimately, Macau still wields considerable influence over shares of MGM and rivals there — Wynn, LVS and Melco Resorts & Entertainment (MLCO).In recent years, China has accused junket operators, the middlemen who loan VIPs money to bypass cash the nation's cash limits, of money laundering. Macau authorities have also set limits on daily ATM cash withdrawals for China UnionPay cardholders — a big source of spending in the gaming hub — and recently said it would begin using facial recognition technology to verify the identities of those cardholders.After concerns VIPs would be scared away, business has picked up. But regulations in China remain hard to predict.""You can never relax about Macau,"" Katz said.MGM shares were up nearly 1% to 31.25 on Friday.

The latter, up more than 8% past a 109.52 cup-with-handle breakout point, reported thin gains in Q1 earnings and revenue.Go to a weekly chart of United Tech, and you'll see that the stock can also be seen as still forming an aircraft carrier-sized saucer base stretching to its February 2015 peak of 124.45.From that perspective, one could argue that another handle formed on this extremely long base with an additional buy point of 114.54, 10 cents above the March 1 intraday high.United Tech CEO Gregory Hayes noted that all four main businesses saw top-line growth, driven by 3 percentage points of organic growth and 1 point of net acquisition growth, offset by a 1% drop related to currency flows. Otis brand elevator and related equipment orders rose 11% excluding China.Amid the selling carnage seen in U.S. Steel (X) shares following its poor quarterly revenue, the steel sector actually does not look so bad when viewed through the prism of U.S. Steel's more highly rated rivals, Nucor (NUE) and Steel Dynamics (STLD).Both of these stocks rebounded sharply off intraday lows and kept their heads above the 50-day moving average. This is key, as IBD research of the best stock market winners over the past century shows that a true market leader trades above its 50-day and 200-day moving averages ahead of a possible breakout from a well-formed historical chart pattern, including the cup-with-handle, the double-bottom and the flat base.Nucor, up 2% to 62.15, is less than 9% below a recent high of 68 and is building a new base. The RS Rating of 71 is below the ideal minimum of 80 on a scale of 1 to 99, but it's moved up from 51 just two weeks ago.Last week, Nucor posted a 304% leap in first-quarter earnings to $1.13 a share, its biggest year-over-year increase in more than four years, as revenue accelerated 30% higher to $4.82 billion. Nucor's after-tax margin soared to 7.5% vs. 2.4% in the year-ago quarter.Steel Dynamics on April 19 posted a fifth quarter in a row of excellent profit growth, with EPS rising 215% to 82 cents on a 36% gain on the top line to $2.37 billion. That was the highest quarterly sales since the fourth quarter of 2014. Steel Dynamics is fashioning a new base that shows many jagged edges — one of the telltale signs of investing in commodity-linked companies. In many cases, the right time to buy such a stock is not at the primary breakout but possibly during the first pullback following the breakout.Elsewhere in the market, keep an eye on top names in the gaming industry. IBD's Leisure-Gaming group has trampolined up to 24th from 80th six weeks ago, as seen in IBD's daily ranking of 197 industry groups based on six-month relative price performance.Watch for Las Vegas Sands' (LVS) first-quarter results after the market close on Wednesday. The Street sees earnings rising 38% to 62 cents a share, which would be the best bottom-line result since a 78% jump in the third quarter of 2013.The stock, up 1.5% on Wednesday in strong turnover, is fashioning the right side of a potential new saucer base with a 63.38 high. For now, the base shows a 63.48 entry.Sands' arch rival Wynn Resorts (WYNN) saw a 3.5% drop in Q1 revenue from its Macau-related business. That was offset by a 6% rise in revenue from its Las Vegas casino hotels.Wynn shows a better RS Rating than Sands at 85 vs. 64, as seen in IBD Stock Checkup. Meanwhile, eight other companies in the gaming group boast an RS rating of 90 or higher and trade at least 10 a share.

Crude oil futures topped $75 but then pulled back.The Dow Jones undercut its 200-day moving average on Tuesday, the S&P 500 index sank below its 50-day line while the Nasdaq composite tested its 50-day as China trade war fears grew.

Micron tumbled as a Chinese court barred some sales in the country.The electric-car maker managed to top a long-delayed production goal of 5,000 Model 3 sedans in the final week of June.

Biogen stock skyrocketed Friday.Micron Technology (MU) says a Chinese court ruled against the memory-chip maker in a patent-infringement case without giving it a chance to present its defense. The injunction covers certain DRAM modules and solid-state drives, representing slightly more than 1% of Micron's annualized revenue. Micron stock tumbled 5.5% on Tuesday, while investors saw the court ruling as part of China's retaliation to Trump tariff threats.

Fed contacts indicated that tit-for-tat tariffs and escalating trade threats were starting to impact business confidence and investment plans. Several policymakers raised concern about the narrowing of the gap between short-term and long-term Treasury yields, given that an inversion — longer rates falling below shorter ones — historically precedes a recession. Still, the Fed hiked its key rate a quarter-point for the second time in 2018 at the June meeting. Members also issued projections indicating a likelihood of two more rate hikes this year.The Washington Post reported that a federal investigation into Facebook's sharing of data with political consultancy Cambridge Analytica has broadened to focus on the tech giant's actions and statements.

270,WYNN,"XFutures for the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq 100 edged higher early Wednesday morning following a second strong day of solid market gains. The Nasdaq composite is at a record high, while the S&P 500 index and Dow industrials are within 1% of all-time bests.The recent gains have been broad-based, but Apple (AAPL) and the FANG internet giants (Facebook (FB), Amazon.com (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL)) have been leading the charge in 2017.

275,WYNN,"XU.S. equity indexes staged a mild rebound in afternoon trading Thursday, chipping away a little more of Tuesday's sudden sell-off. But volume is running lower as Wall Street awaits a key first step in the possible overhaul of the ObamaCare legislation that extended health insurance to millions of Americans.Meanwhile, a pair of names from IBD's leisure gaming industry group — Wynn Resorts (WYNN) and Las Vegas Sands (LVS) — as well as one hotelier and two specialty retailers are showing uncommon strength among their peers and quite possibly deserve a spot in investors' watch lists.The Dow Jones industrial average and the S&P 500 were both up more than 0.1%, a step ahead of the Nasdaq composite. On Tuesday, the 30-stock Dow industrials slid 1.1%, then edged fractionally lower on Wednesday following a negative reaction to Nike's (NKE) weaker-than-anticipated report on future apparel unit orders.Other important indexes fared better. The NYSE composite, boosted by gains in diversified operations firms, banks and select retailers, rose 0.5%. The Russell 2000 gained nearly 1%.Five Below (FIVE) is one of the five consumer plays that are doing well in recent weeks. On Thursday, the stock jumped more than 11% to 42.58, piercing back above its 50- and 200-day moving averages, in volume that is already more than five times its 50-day average of 1.1 million shares.After the close on Wednesday, the Philadelphia-based chain selling popular items at $5 or less reported a 17% rise in fiscal fourth-quarter profit to 90 cents a share. That merely equaled Wall Street's consensus view, but it also stretched Five Below's run of double-digit EPS growth to six quarters. Sales gained 19% to $388.1 million, a quarterly record. Five Below debuted on the Nasdaq in July 2012 at 17 a share. The stock has been working on a new base since topping at 52.70 in late July last year. Watch to see if its RS Rating and Accumulation/Distribution, both horrible right now, improve sharply in the coming days and weeks.On the positive side, Five Below gets a positive up/down volume ratio of 1.1, as seen in IBD Stock Checkup. Prefer those stocks that have a ratio of 1.0 or better before a potential breakout.IBD's Leisure-Gaming/Equipment group has jumped to No. 71 from No. 126 among 197 industry groups over the past two weeks. Helping lead the charge is Wynn Resorts, which fell about 1% to 112.25 but is still up big for the week. Shares are also up more than 7% past a 104.49 buy point within a shallow saucer base.Profits and sales have been hurt by a clampdown in gambling and lavish spending by Chinese government officials in Macau in recent years, but Wynn's top line has returned to growth mode. Revenue fell 9% in the first quarter of 2016, but then rebounded to gains of 2%, 11% and 37% in the past three quarters.Las Vegas Sands, which competes head on with Wynn both in Vegas and in the former Portuguese colony island of Macau, edged 0.2% lower to 55.73 in light trade. But the large-cap name is possibly building the right side of a new cup pattern. Also in the lodging space, Marriott International (MAR) continues to soar, even after marking a new high on Wednesday. The hotel giant rallied more than 1% to 93.48 in fast turnover and has kept above its 50-day moving average since breaking out in mid-November past a 74.09 cup buy point.Kate Spade (KATE), reported to be mulling a sale of itself to a fellow fashion apparel rival, is virtually flat at 22.94 but has also been building the right side of a long, deep cup-style base. A handle has formed with a 24.34 entry.

It's clearly going to be the Nasdaq's biggest single-session drop since the Nov. 8 U.S. elections.The S&P 500 was down nearly 1%. The Dow Jones industrial average provided no relief as it too fell more than 0.9%.

Volume was running about 26% above average levels.The Wall Street bank, which has thrived by recent movement in U.S. Treasury bonds, is triggering its first major sell signal since breaking out of a long first-stage base with a 172.52 buy point in late October. The gain reached as high as 48%, big enough to have justified taking profits on the way up.One could decide to sell at least half a position bought at the proper entry, then see if the Dow Jones industrials component can rebound back to its 50-day line.

Superregional lender SVB Financial (SIVB) took out its 50-day moving average for the first time since its early October breakout from a large bottoming-style base. Shares in the Santa Clara, Calif., firm slumped more than 6% to 175.84 in more than double average trade. At its 198.83 peak, SVB rose as much as 76% from the 112.93 handle entry.Also in IBD's superregional bank industry group, Dallas-based Comerica (CMA) and SunTrust Banks (STI) of Atlanta dropped more than 5% in heavy turnover and triggered the 50-day line sell rule.Phoenix-based Western Alliance Bancorp (WAL), a top-rated company in IBD's West/Southwest bank group, got slammed with a 7% drop to 47.05, also sinking below its 50-day line in volume running nearly four times usual levels.The stock also triggered the golden rule of selling by falling more than 7% below a recent new flat base entry at 50.82.IBD 50 stocks were not immune to the blanket-like sell-off.China's top internet video game firm NetEase (NTES) slid nearly 4% to 282.59. Yet for now, the stock is holding above its fast-rising 50-day moving average and keeping the air pocket created by an earnings-inspired Feb. 16 big gap up in price. The stock is also still extended more than 5% past a 257.78 cup-with-handle entry point.Cognex (CGNX) and Veeva Systems (VEEV) both fell more than 2% in heavy trading. The former has already gained more than 50% since clearing a 53.55 flat-base entry, while the latter pulled back near a 48.05 flat-base buy point. Yet Veeva has also risen significantly since it broke out of a first-stage bottoming base pattern at 28.05 in May 2016.Keeping gains by selling at least half the position after the rally has exceeded 20% to 25% is a smart portfolio management technique for your growth stocks.On the upside, Wynn Resorts (WYNN) is staging an eighth straight up-day, rising 1% to 112.93. That pushed the gaming resort operator's advance to 8% past a 104.49 buy point, in a choppy cup-with-handle base — so shares are extended.

290,WYNN,"The new Trump administration has already lined up the first shots in a clash of trade titans.Calling China ""the most protectionist country"" among major U.S. trading partners, Wilbur Ross, Donald Trump's choice to run the Commerce Department, on Wednesday signaled new tariffs for Chinese steel and aluminum industries dumping their products in the U.S. at artificially low prices.That gave U.S. steel stocks a one-day boost. But if the protectionist rhetoric and actions continue to ratchet higher, U.S. companies with a big China presence, such as Apple (AAPL), General Motors (GM) and Boeing (BA), could get caught in the crossfire.China, via the state-run Global Times, has already warned that it could target Apple, Boeing and Starbucks (SBUX) if Trump followed through on his campaign rhetoric by slapping a 45% tariff on U.S. imports from China.China accounts for about 4.8% of S&P 500 revenue, according to FactSet. But many big U.S. companies rely on China for at least 10% of revenue — some more than 50%. They could take a disproportionate hit if the conflict intensifies. Some other companies with broad exposure to China include Intel (INTC), Qualcomm (QCOM), Nike (NKE) and Las Vegas Sands (LVS), according to an IBD review of company filings.Deteriorating trade relations with China wouldn't only risk near-term revenue but also future growth plans. Starbucks, for example, now has about 2,400 stores in China but envisions having 5,000 by 2021. China needs 6,840 airplanes valued at $1 trillion through 2035, Boeing says.Markets still see a full-fledged trade war as unlikely and Trump's harshest threats as part of his negotiating strategy. The Eurasia Group, which analyzes political risk for investors, wrote that it expects the Trump administration to ""aggressively accelerate the pace of anti-dumping, anti-subsidy and other unilateral actions against specific Chinese imports, but they will not adopt across-the-board tariffs in order to maintain room for a negotiated solution.""In the near term, that wouldn't necessarily be a major departure. President Obama imposed a 35% tariff on Chinese tires in 2009, citing a surge in imports, and anti-dumping duties on imports of Chinese solar panels and cold-rolled flat steel.IBD'S TAKE: Donald Trump has made a number of threats on trade, from targeting specific companies to sweeping tariffs. Here's what Trump has the power to do on Nafta, China and taxes.Yet Eurasia Group analysts Evan Medeiros and Michael Hirson write that China is likely to ""retaliate immediately and proportionally"" with the goal of inflicting ""substantial but not overwhelming pain on U.S. firms"" to persuade Trump not to take broader, more destabilizing steps. Among the likely targets are ""iconic American consumer goods"" and companies in agriculture, aviation, financial services, tourism and technology.They note that China has myriad ways to create trouble for American companies, from regulatory actions, to delaying or denying approval for licenses, to blocking an M&A deal.American companies already feel that Beijing is making their lives more difficult. A survey by American Chamber of Commerce in China out this week found that 81% of members felt less welcome than before vs. 77% a year ago, while 24% said the investment environment was improving and 31% said it was getting worse.If Trump used his trade leverage to push China to ensure a more level playing field for American companies in China, that could help their growth prospects. Yet he appears more interested in using his leverage to convince Apple to shift much of its production to the U.S., even if that substantially raises the cost of an iPhone.No company has more at stake in China than Apple, which accounted for $46.4 billion in sales in its latest fiscal year, or 22% of total revenue. And China is where most of its iPhones are pieced together.Global Equities Research analyst Trip Chowdhry is a rare analyst who thinks Trump will prevail upon Apple to significantly ramp up iPhone production in the U.S. for the domestic market. ""Companies who are America First — Made in the USA by the USA workers — will outperform the rest,"" Chowdhry wrote.Yet Chowdhry, recognizing that domestic production would hike costs and likely lower margins, concludes: ""Days of share buybacks and dividends are over.""UBS analyst Steve Milunovich considered a far different trade outcome in which Trump signs onto the House GOP's plan to cut the corporate tax rate to 20% and apply a 20% tax on the value of imports. Under this scenario, tax reform would be a net negative for Apple, with an outright earnings decline coming from a tax on the value of iPhones it imports to sell in the U.S. and lower foreign earnings due to an associated rise in the dollar.Yet for all the hand-wringing, Apple shares are up about 8% since the November election.GM's joint ventures with China totaled $45 billion, or 30% of total revenue, in the latest fiscal year. In December, China hit GM with a $29 million fine for price-fixing, leading to speculation that the fine carried a political message for the incoming president.Yet Eurasia Group figures that GM and Ford (F) may be less vulnerable to retaliation from China because their Chinese joint-venture partners would also suffer.More than half the wireless chipmaker's $23.6 billion in revenue came from China in the latest year, though that reflects China's lead in mobile phone production, not just its large base of end customers. The San Diego-based company has been on a roll lately — especially in China — making inroads with Chinese phone makers after it agreed to pay Beijing $975 million in 2015 to settle an antitrust probe of its licensing practices.If China wants to send a message to Trump, it could stall Qualcomm's acquisition of NXP Semiconductors (NXPI), a Dutch maker of chips for the automotive market as well as mobile devices. NXP CEO Rick Clemmer told Barron's that China could delay the deal if trade frictions rise, but he sees almost no chance it will be blocked.Sales of Boeing aircraft to China, which amounted to $12.6 billion in the latest fiscal year, support 150,000 jobs for American workers, the company boasted in December to underscore the risk of a deepening trade rift.Few companies represent a bigger or simpler target than Boeing. Morningstar and Eurasia Group analysts have warned that China could shift its business to Airbus, rewarding Europe as it penalizes the U.S.Wynn Resorts (WYNN) and Las Vegas Sands both get close to 60% of their revenue from their China properties in the autonomous Macau coastal region of China. Both have just opened new casino resorts in the world's biggest gambling market, increasing their exposure. Trump, a onetime casino mogul himself, has a long association with their bosses. Steve Wynn is a finance chair of Trump's inaugural committee, while Sands CEO Sheldon Adelson is a GOP megadonor. Trump's infrastructure spending agenda and his pledge to use Caterpillar (CAT) and Deere (DE) equipment to build a wall on the southern border helped boost shares of the long-suffering construction vehicle maker. But Caterpillar, which gets about 8% of its revenue directly from China, is wary about the implications of a trade war.Caterpillar's outgoing CEO Doug Oberhelman expressed concern about ""being held out of a lot of the markets"" like China as retaliation for Trump's saber-rattling.Macquarie Research analyst Sameer Rathod downgraded the shares after their run-up last month, noting that Trump ""being aggressive on anti-dumping duties would be detrimental to global growth and trade and is likely going to be a negative for aggregate commodity demand.""RELATED:Amazon, Alibaba, Ford, Wal-Mart May Offer Trump-Proofing PlaybookWhy Trump Tax Reform Could Hurt Alibaba, Other ADRs

291,WYNN,"It's becoming apparent that the Echo smart speak from Amazon.com (AMZN) has solidified its position as a durable and strong business pillar at the e-commerce giant, alongside its cloud computing unit and Amazon Prime loyalty program, says Morningstar.Introduced two years ago, Echo is an in-home, voice-activated digital butler infused with voice recognition and artificial intelligence that plays music, reads books, provides traffic and weather, and answers a slew of questions from users, among other things.Teamed with Alexa, its voice and brains, the Echo smart speaker has grabbed a post position in the race to give the world the best and smartest digital assistant, another battle that pits Amazon against Google-owner Alphabet (GOOGL), Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT) in a battle over being a smart-home hub.Amazon offers three Echo devices, ranging in price from $50 to $180. Analysts estimate that Amazon has sold more than 5 million Echo units.IBD'S TAKE: Amazon, Apple, Alphabet and Microsoft are strengthening their connection to customers with mobile and in-home devices infused with advanced speech recognition and artificial intelligence. The devices could evolve into the next major disruption in computing and put the smart home on a fast track.Morningstar analyst R.J. Hottovy, in a research note, said he views Echo as an early-stage product with several longer-term benefits. He says it will enhance Amazon's overall network and help keep consumers in the Amazon ecosystem.""We believe Amazon is just starting to scratch the surface of what it could do with Alexa, including licensing the technology to other products,"" Hottovy wrote. ""In addition to our longer-term optimism about Alexa and the Echo family of products, we walked away from Amazon's holiday season with greater confidence in the company's ability to drive operating income at or even above the high end of previous guidance.""Perhaps most important is that Echo provides Amazon with ""unrivaled customer data, offering a key longer-term competitive advantage,"" he wrote.Amazon stock, though, fell 2% to 749.87 in the stock market today. Amazon stock has struggled to regain its 50-day line for the past two months.Amazon this month got a big boost for its Echo device from Wynn Resorts (WYNN), which said it plans to equip each of the 4,748 guest rooms at the Wynn Las Vegas hotel with an Echo.The Echo-Wynn announcement came as Microsoft gave a sneak peek at a new hardware device that will rival Echo.""We're at the beginning of a technological revolution in artificial intelligence,"" said a blog post by the Windows Apps Team. ""The personal digital assistant is the interface where all the powers of that intelligence can become an extension of each one of us.""Alphabet in October followed Amazon with the introduction of Google Home, a voice-activated speaker powered by the Google Assistant, which sells for $129.Apple is also in the game with its voice-activated Siri program on Apple iPhones, but has not yet signaled when it might introduce an in-home digital assistant. RELATED: Amazon Spreads Its Tentacles Far Beyond 'World's Biggest Bookstore'Amazon In Talks For Live Sports Package Available To Prime MembersAmazon Set To Disrupt Retailers In Apparel, Groceries, ServicesAmazon's Next Big Growth Opportunity Could Be Apparel

293,WYNN,"Japan's parliament passed a bill legalizing casinos early on Thursday, paving the way for billions of dollars of potential investment after years of political wrangling.The revised casino bill was passed in both houses, Kyodo News reported, after hours of delaying tactics by the opposition. Details of the so-called integrated resorts must be laid out in a separate implementation bill before any casinos can be built — meaning none is likely to open its doors in time for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.International gaming companies have been mulling investments in Japan amid a boom in tourism, particularly from China. Wynn Resorts (WYNN), MGM Resorts International (MGM) and Las Vegas Sands (LVS) are among the operators that have expressed interest. Opening two integrated resorts in major population centers could bring in $10 billion in revenue, with potential for $30 billion if they spread across the country, according to a report by CLSA this month.""This is a landmark occasion and should be a shot in the arm as it relates to investor sentiment in all gaming names that could be players in Japan,"" Grant Govertsen, an analyst at Union Gaming, said in a research note.Some members of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's junior coalition partner Komeito, which is backed by a Buddhist group, have been reluctant to accept legalization because of concerns over gambling addiction and money laundering. A duty to tackle addiction is included in the revised bill, as is a requirement to review legalization within five years.""We have to pay close attention to the implementation bill,"" said Satoshi Sakamoto, who has been tapped by Konami Holdings Corp. to head a new company in Japan to invest in casinos after the legislation passes. ""If we are going to have casinos in Japan, we will establish the best regulations in the world, along with the personnel and systems to enforce them. It's important that we create facilities where guests have a safe and pleasant experience.""Japan already allows gambling on horse, boat and bicycle racing, while the pinball-like game of pachinko has spawned its own addicts. A survey published by public broadcaster NHK this week found only 12% of respondents were in favor of lifting the casino ban, with 44% opposed and the remainder unsure.The bill was previously abandoned after being submitted to Parliament in 2013 and debate was delayed after a second submission last year. It was rushed through this session after discussion was reopened on Nov. 30.Komeito leader Natsuo Yamaguchi was quoted by Kyodo News as saying earlier this month many people felt the discussion period had been too short. With a majority in both houses, Abe's LDP no longer needs Komeito to help it pass legislation, although it does rely on its ally for electoral support.Yokohama and Osaka have been touted as potential venues for the first casino resorts, while Tokyo Gov. Yuriko Koike has not come out clearly in favor of a venue in the capital.

294,WYNN,"Amazon (AMZN) got a big boost for its Echo device from Wynn Las Vegas, which Wednesday announced plans to equip all 4,748 rooms at the hotel with the voice-controlled speaker system that's infused with artificial intelligence — and that could evolve into the next major disruption in computing.The announcement by Wynn Resorts (WYNN) comes as Microsoft (MSFT) gave a sneak peek at a new hardware device that looks similar to Echo. The device has the Harman (HAR) label but is voice-controlled through Cortana, Microsoft's artificial intelligence platform. Harman is a developer of high-quality speakers, which Samsung Electronics is spending $8 billion to acquire. Microsoft said the device will ship in 2017.Google-owner Alphabet (GOOGL) is also in on the game for personal digital assistants in the home. Alphabet in October followed Amazon with the introduction of Google Home, a voice-activated speaker powered by the Google Assistant, which sells for $129.But Amazon was first to market with Echo — an in-home, voice-activated digital butler that plays music, reads books and provides traffic and weather, among other things.

It's a product that further cements a user's attachment to Amazon.Echo will be added to every guest room at Wynn Las Vegas hotel, starting this month. Guests can control various hotel room features with a series of voice commands.Wynn Resorts CEO Steve Wynn heaped praise on Alexa.""As we have moved through the years, technology has always played an important part in our resorts,"" Wynn said in a press release. ""The thing that Amazon has done with Alexa is quite perfect.

295,WYNN,"Shares of casino operators with big Macau operations rebounded Friday after the Chinese gambling enclave limited ATM withdrawals by less than a media report.The Macau Monetary Authority limited ATM withdrawals for China UnionPay cardholders to 5,000 patacas ($646) at a time, but the daily withdrawal limit of 10,000 patacas remains. The South China Morning Post had reported Thursday that the daily cap would be halved to 5,000 patacas as of Saturday.Las Vegas Sands (LVS) rose 1.2% in the stock market today, but well off morning highs. MGM Resorts (MGM) climbed 2.1%, Wynn Resorts (WYNN) 1.3% and Melco Crown Entertainment (MPEL) about 1%.Those gains recouped only a fraction of casino stocks' big Thursday losses.Cash withdrawals via UnionPay fuel much of the spending on casinos in Macau. UnionPay ATM withdrawals are used by nearly half the Chinese customers in Macau to obtain money for gambling, Bloomberg said, citing research from Bernstein.The withdrawal cap has been seen as an attempt by Chinese authorities to curb the outflow of yuan from China.RELATED:Macau Gaming Is Stabilizing, But Investors Already Made That BetTime To Bet On Casino Stocks As Macau Nears Turnaround?

300,WYNN,"The head of Macau's government gave a conservative forecast Tuesday for gambling revenue next year that's 13% below analyst estimates amid a nascent recovery in the world's biggest casino hub.Macau's government is confident the economy will recover to grow in the low single-digits in 2017, Chief Executive Fernando Chui said at a briefing Tuesday. Chui's gambling revenue target is unchanged from his  forecast for 2016, as the government seeks to limit the growth of its casino industry and pushed operators such as Las Vegas Sands (LVS) and Galaxy Entertainment Group to focus on tourists instead of hard-core gamblers.""We didn't set a higher target than this year because we think there are still uncertain factors,"" Chui said, referring to his gaming revenue forecast of $25 billion for 2017. That compares with the median estimate of $28.8 billion from five analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.Shares of Las Vegas Sands, which opened a new Macau resort in September and reported a 19% increase in visitors to its properties there that month, gained 1.6% to $57.93 in midday trades Tuesday. Wynn Resorts (WYNN), which also recently opened an additional resort in Macau, climbed 3%, while MGM Resorts (MGM) rose 0.8%.Macau's casino industry has been recovering since August from 26 straight months of revenue declines as operators open family-friendly resorts, while a two-year slump in its gross domestic product has also eased. The city's shift from high-stakes Chinese bettors comes amid President Xi Jinping's efforts to curb official corruption and limit capital outflow, ordering Macau to diversify from gambling during his visit two years ago.Macau's recovery comes as China signals a crackdown on foreign casinos that woo its citizens to gamble overseas, detaining 18 employees of Australia's Crown Resorts involved in marketing to high-rollers. Macau's gaming regulator chief Paulo Chan met with the city's six casino operators after the incident, reminding them to obey local laws when working outside the gambling hub and adding that Macau gaming won't be affected by the arrests.Speaking at a casino industry event in Macau on Tuesday, Chan said the government will continue strengthening its laws to regulate the city's gaming industry. The gaming regulator also has had several discussions on raising entry barriers for junket operators, middlemen who bring in mainland Chinese players and lend them money to play with, he said.Analysts expect gambling revenue for 2016 will comfortably exceed Chui's forecast, with the median of four estimates for $27.6 billion, a decline of 4.5% from 2015. Macau already has reported $23.1 billion in gambling receipts in the first 10 months of this year.""The government has historically, and rightly, presented a conservative forecast as it relates to gross gaming revenue,"" Grant Govertsen, a Macau-based gaming analyst at Union Gaming Group LLC, said by email. ""Based on trends we're seeing today, we remain comfortable with our expectations for mid-single digit growth next year.""

301,WYNN,"MGM Resorts' (MGM) third-quarter results topped estimates, and management is upbeat on the Las Vegas market, while rivals have seen disappointing results from Macau.On Monday, MGM said earnings soared 675% to 93 cents per share, including items related to the Borgata acquisition and a charge related to the NV Energy exit. Adjusted EPS was 53 cents. Wall Street analysts were expecting 9 cents. Total revenue rose 20% to $2.73 billion, above views for $2.39 billion.MGM shares ended 2.9% higher at 27.18 on the stock market today, rising above buy range after breaking out from a 25.39 buy point in September.MGM, which has a smaller footprint on Macau than Wynn Resorts (WYNN) and Las Vegas Sands (LVS) do, said domestic net revenue rose 16% to $1.9 billion, while same-store revenue was up 8%. Domestic casino revenue climbed 23% on the Borgata acquisition in Atlantic City and an increase in both table games and slots revenue. Room revenue rose 14%.""We continue to see strength in the Las Vegas market and believe that the company can drive growth across all room segments in the fourth quarter, despite a challenging comparison,"" said CEO Jim Murren in a release. ""Based on these current trends, we remain confident in our ability to further increase room revenues in 2017.""In China, net revenue fell 6% to $500 million but revenue from main floor table games increased 21% year-over-year.MGM China, which is majority owned by MGM Resorts, said Q3 revenue rose 11% from Q2, and Macau's gross gaming revenue was up 7% sequentially.IBD'S TAKE: Macau appears poised for a rebound as gambling revenue in the administrative district's gaming industry rose 1.1% in August. But not all analysts are ready to be on it. Last week, Wynn Resorts reported Q3 earnings under analyst views, and revenue from its Wynn Palace resort in Macau's Cotai district fell short of exceptions.Wynn shares dipped 0.2% to 87.86 Monday.Also last week, Las Vegas Sands reported better-than-expected quarterly results, but revenue from its Macau resorts missed Wall Street exceptions.Shares lost 0.3% to finish at 58.89.RELATED: Casino Stocks: A Good Bet In A Dicey Market?

302,WYNN,"With Wynn Resorts (WYNN) expected to capture more Macau market share when its new $4.1 billion Wynn Palace opens in the next few months, at least one analyst is wagering on the company right now.Shares of the Las Vegas-based casino company rose 2.4% to 95 in the stock market today, rising as high as 96.60 intraday, after Morgan Stanley analyst Thomas Allen upgraded its stock to overweight from neutral, with a $120 price target.The 28-story, 1,700-room Wynn Palace hotel and casino will be the second resort that the company owns in Macau, the former Portuguese colony on China's southern coast that's grown into the world's top gambling destination. Wynn competes there with MGM Resorts International (MGM), Las Vegas Sands (LVS), Melco Crown Entertainment (MPEL) and others.Macau entered its worst-ever recession in mid-2014 amid slowing economic growth in China, a crackdown on corruption by the Chinese government and a partial smoking ban in Macau. Casino executives and many analysts have said that the region shows signs of stabilizing and could begin growing again as early as this year.Allen said in a report that there's still too much market risk in Macau to recommend both Wynn and Sands, the top two Macau casino operators, but he thinks that Wynn's expanding market share as it opens the new facility makes it ""a good bet.""""With Macau at least stabilizing, and Wynn going from a double-digit EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) decliner to double-digit grower in the next six months, we believe stock momentum can continue, given Wynn's long-term potential,"" Allen said in the report.After plunging 80% from its all-time intraday high of 249.31 in March 2014, Wynn stock bottomed at 49.95 on Jan. 15 of this year before turning up. It's nearly doubled in the last two months.  Its stock has an IBD Relative Strength Rating of 93.As expected, MGM Resorts International on Tuesday filed for an initial public offering of its real estate investment trust, MGM Growth Properties. The company announced the IPO, which is projected to be valued at about $1 billion, on its third quarter 2015 earnings call.Wells Fargo analyst Cameron McKnight said in a report Tuesday, ""Any multiple uplift from the IPO is largely in the stock."" McKnight has an outperform rating on MGM, which rose fractionally to 20.96.Las Vegas Sands, the world's biggest casino company, was flat at 53.27. Melco Crown Entertainment fell 1.35% to 16.85.

304,WYNN,"Prospects are improving for Macau-centric casinos like Las Vegas Sands (LVS), Wynn Resorts (WYNN) and MGM Resorts International (MGM), but they're not out of the woods yet, said Macquarie analyst Chad Beynon.He expects total Macau gambling revenue to shrink 6% this year, after sinking 24% in 2015, then go flat next year, and grow 3% in 2018.Macau went into recession in mid-2014 because gamblers and tourists stayed away in droves as China's economic growth began to cool, Chinese officials launched a nationwide crackdown on corruption, and Macau enacted a partial smoking ban.In a report on Friday, Beynon said that, based on a forecast model and channel checks, he has ""positively adjusted"" Macau market estimates, as well as company estimates. He maintained an outperform rating on his top pick, Sands, and raised his price target to 54 up from 48.He remains neutral on Wynn and lifted his price target to 70 from 63, saying Wynn ""historically generates the highest EBITDA per table among gaming companies.""He noted that both Wynn and MGM have delayed planned new Macau casinos. That's lowered total Macau gambling revenue but ""will help overall industry margins.""Beynon has an outperform rating on MGM and maintained a price target of 30.Shares of the big three Las Vegas casinos, which all depend in large part on Macau for growth, plus Hong Kong-based Melco Crown Entertainment (MPEL), another top Macau casino operator, have collectively risen an average of about 57% since mid-January.Other analysts have projected a return to revenue growth for Macau, on a quarterly basis, could come as early as the second half of this year. In February, revenue was virtually flat.In a report on Friday, Deutsche Bank analyst Carlo Santarelli maintained a buy rating on Wynn and raised his price target to 94 from 82, saying, ""we remain longer term bullish, given our favorable view of the Cotai (Macau) project, for which our current forecasts leave meaningful room for upward revisions.""On March 7, UBS analyst Robin Farley said in a report about Macau-centric casino stocks, ""Step up and pay today, or be constructive on a pullback."" She added that ""investors may have to pay more on entry now that the fundamentals are more clearly improving."" Farley raised her rating on Wynn to buy from neutral, and lifted her price target to 95 from 73.Shares of Las Vegas Sands closed up 0.5% in the stock market today, up more than 50% from a Jan. 20 intraday low of 34.88.

306,WYNN,"Shares of Wynn Resorts (WYNN) and other Macau-centric casino companies have rallied recently, but Sterne Agee CRT says the upward move may be too much, too soon.Sterne Agree CRT analyst David Bain downgraded Wynn on Friday to a neutral rating from buy, with an 85 price target. Bain said its stock may be rising too fast, given conditions in Macau. Investors ignored the report and Wynn stock continued its weeks-long climb.Bain noted that at the time he wrote the report, Las Vegas-based Wynn's shares had risen 46% since Feb. 10 (Wynn was up 49% from that point as of Friday afternoon).Las Vegas Sands (LVS), MGM Resorts International (MGM) and Melco Crown Entertainment (MPEL) also have large casino resorts in Macau and have seen their stocks rise at a rapid rate this month on an increasing number of upbeat indicators from the Chinese special administrative district.Bain sounded a note of caution about Wynn's Macau casinos, saying, ""We believe upside is limited, especially with the backdrop of still continuing struggles in the VIP segment, which Wynn is more levered to versus peers.""Wynn plans to open the Wynn Palace in Macau in the back half of 2016, but Bain said benefits from that new casino are already priced in and ""the bear case may be underappreciated, given initial relatively soft results"" of competitors' recent expansions.UBS on March 7 upgraded Wynn Resorts to buy from neutral, with a 95 price target. UBS analyst Robin Farley said in a report that conditions in Macau are stabilizing and this might be a good time for investors to consider getting back into casinos with Macau exposure.Macau's slump began in mid-2014 amid a weakening of China's economy, partial smoking ban on casinos and a crackdown by the Chinese government on corruption, which made some VIP category high rollers nervous.Wynn shares closed up 2.4% in the stock market today. After five straight quarters in which its earning per share growth shrank at a double-digit rate, year over year, analyst consensus is for Wynn's EPS to climb 9% this quarter.Las Vegas Sands rose 1.9% Friday. MGM Resorts International added 2.3%. Wynn, Sands and MGM were all trading above both their 50-day moving averages and their 200-day lines.

307,WYNN,"MGM Resorts International (MGM) got a pair of good reviews from Morgan Stanley and from activist investor Land and Buildings, pushing its stock price higher.In an open letter to MGM investors, Land and Buildings CEO Jonathan Litt chastised Wall Street for what he sees as the ""distressingly low level"" of MGM's stock price relative to its peers.A separate Morgan Stanley report said that MGM is the most-efficient operator in Macau, besting Las Vegas peers Las Vegas Sands (LVS) and Wynn Resorts (WYNN), as well as Hong Kong-based Melco Crown Entertainment (MPEL).Land and Buildings severely criticized MGM early last year and successfully pushed the casino operator to separate its land holdings and free shareholder value. In a turnaround from last year, Litt in the letter praised MGM's recent performance, saying there are ""multiple catalysts that should lead to substantial upside from current levels.""""MGM is many analysts' top pick with 40% upside to target price of $28.50,"" Litt said, adding that ""Fourth-quarter results and the outlook for 2016 are unambiguously robust."" He added, however: ""We will continue to watch the results of MGM very carefully to see if their actions back up their words.""After losing 44% of its stock value in the last two years, MGM bottomed at 16.18 on Feb. 9 before turning up. It has climbed about 24% from that point and closed 3.7% higher in the stock market today.On Oct. 29, MGM complied with Land and Buildings' request and agreed to place 10 of its properties, including seven on the Las Vegas Strip, into a real estate investment trust that's 70% owned by the casino giant.As reported earlier, recent numbers in Macau, the former Portuguese colony turned gambling hot spot on China's southern coast, have pointed to an upturn there after the special administrative district, beginning in mid-2014 went through its worst-ever economic downturn.Morgan Stanley analyst Praveen Choudhary said in a report Wednesday that staff is the largest fixed cost item for Macau casinos, contributing up to 70% of operating expenses. Choudhary said on that basis, ""MGM China generates higher EBITDA per person employed when compared to Wynn Macau,"" which traditionally had the best staff costs.In a comparison of all Macau operators, MGM China scored an 88 on employee efficiency costs in the Morgan Stanley report, vs. an 82 for Sands China, a 75 for Wynn Macau and 73 for Melco Crown Entertainment.Las Vegas Sands rose 2.25% and Wynn Resorts added 1.6%.

The S&P 500 ended Thursday's session about 2% below its 200-day moving average after meeting resistance near that line several times throughout the week.  It had also tried and failed to retake support at the psychologically important level several times in December before diving to a deeper correction.The Nasdaq picked up a distribution day Thursday,  but its 0.3% decline didn't indicate heavy institutional selling. Still, the higher-volume decline raised the index's overall count to three distribution days -- not a danger sign, but also not what you'd like to see in a young uptrend and a reminder that defensive trading represents a large share of the market's recent action.Oil stocks packed the top of the S&P 500 in early trade, as oil prices bobbed more than 2% higher. West Texas Intermediate traded just below $39 a barrel, up almost 8% for the week. Brent crude traded near $41, with a weekly gain of more than 9%.

309,WYNN,"Evidence continues to mount that Macau casinos are poised for recovery, which could give a boost to Las Vegas Sands (LVS), Wynn Resorts (WYNN) and MGM Resorts International (MGM).During the critical Chinese New Year holiday, gambling revenue on Macau was flat vs. a year earlier -- a sign of stabilization, as Macau's collective casino revenue has collapsed since mid-2014. UBS sees other signs of improvement.""We have three quarters of sequential stabilization in mass (tourists and middle-class gamblers) revenues and now two quarters of sequential stabilization in VIP revenues,"" according to a Monday report, which also noted that gaming stocks with Macau exposure have risen 20% year to date.UBS upgraded Wynn to buy from neutral and lifted its price target to 95 from 73, citing ""improved outlook and mitigating risk factors."" UBS raised its price target on Las Vegas Sands, the world's biggest casino company, to 52 from 45 and maintained a neutral rating.Wynn, Sands, MGM and Hong Kong-based Melco Crown Entertainment (MPEL) all relied on Macau for the bulk of their growth until 2014, when the Chinese special administrative district across the strait from Hong Kong went into recession.The slump came amid slowing economic growth in China, a crackdown by the Chinese government on corruption, and a partial smoking ban that drove some gamblers away.Wells Fargo analyst Cameron McKnight in a March 4 report said that he, too, is seeing improvement in Macau, but he wasn't ready to call a bottom, noting that March is a better gauge of real demand, ""free of Chinese New Year volatility and other noise.""Wynn Resorts shares closed down 1.7% in the stock market today.

While that's still twice the expected revenue for Las Vegas casinos, it's down from $45.2 billion in 2013 and $44 billion in 2014.Macau, a city on China's southern coast across the strait from Hong Kong, is home to multibillion-dollar casino resorts owned by Sands, Wynn Resorts (WYNN), MGM Resorts International (MGM), Hong Kong-based Melco Crown Entertainment (MPEL) and others.Shares of Las Vegas Sands closed up 1.4% in the stock market today.Wynn Resorts finished 0.4% lower. The casino company on Wednesday announced the delay of the opening of a new casino in Macau, the Wynn Palace in the trendy Cotai area of Macau. Wynn said the casino resort won't be completed until June 25, pushed back from its prior March 25 target. Wynn said it was notified of a delay by its general contractor.MGM Resorts International rose 2%, and Melco Crown Entertainment rose 1.2%.China's slowing economy has cut the number of Chinese tourists visiting the resort city. A crackdown by Chinese officials on the gambling industry and recent partial smoking ban have further curtailed business in Macau.Wells Fargo analyst Cameron McKnight in a report Monday said he sees signs suggesting the market trend is still in decline.""We remain on the sidelines regarding the Macau market, and we expect no V-shaped recovery, as the credit-induced bubble of the past five years continues deflating, and Chinese policies continue to suppress growth,"" McKnight said.Follow James DeTar on Twitter @IBD_JDeTar and on Facebook.

That could be worse than the bank's estimate for a 30% drop.McKnight said in the report, ""Weekly numbers have been volatile since early June, and (we) expect this pattern to continue given continued instability in the VIP segment.""Deutsche Bank noted that after Macau's long run that made it the globe's premier gambling destination, optimism for a recovery is running out.Deutsche Bank analyst Karen Tang said in a research note reported by StreetInsider that November numbers are tracking weak, and pointed to ""unexciting"" early results from Melco Crown's huge new Studio City resort.Tang said that bad luck was partly responsible for the low initial turnout for Studio City but added that the data are still weak, considering the resorts' many attractions. Deutsche Bank has a hold rating on Melco Crown.High roller ""VIP"" category gamblers, who mainly play baccarat, account for a large portion of Macau profits, although ""mass market"" tourists who play other table games spend the most in dollars.In an earlier report, McKnight called out the recent opening of Melco Crown's Studio City resort, which is the first to have TV and movie studios on site, along with casinos, hotels and shops, saying it could give Macau a lift if it was a hit. No such luck.McKnight said in the report that checks suggested the average daily revenues last week for Macau were around 525 million Macau patacas (about $65.76 million), down 9% sequentially and off 36% vs. the same week last year ""despite a full week of results following the Oct. 27 opening of MPEL's Studio City.""

"
490,WYNN,"Tuesday night's Democratic presidential gathering had five alleged candidates onstage. But the ""debate,"" which is what CNN called it, was really only between Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton. And that was quite gentle.A drunk Elmer Fudd could out-talk the other three -- Lincoln Chafee, who looks so lost every moment, and Martin O'Malley, who gives earnestness a bad reputation. Jim Webb -- thank you for your service -- sounds more like he still belongs over on the Republican side. ""I believe I'm where the Democrat Party traditionally has been,"" he said rather forlornly.Anderson Cooper, as chief moderator, did an excellent job, showing impressive, detailed preparation work on each of the candidate's backgrounds and records. He caught them up short with facts when they tried to slip one past the ears of those listeners willing to endure the two-plus hours of progressive palaver. Hint: The word ""debt"" was AWOL.Cooper's style was markedly different than CNN's Jake Tapper in last month's Republican debate. Tapper sculpted questions to pit Republican vs Republican. That's a legitimate way to draw out candidates, get them off too-comfortable talking points.But it plays to the GOP's penchant in primaries to wound each other deeply and then eat the corpses, ignoring there is a general election campaign yet to come for the lone survivor. That knife-fight tendency is now on view in the House Speaker struggle between Republicans and self-proclaimed real Republicans.You may also recall that one of Mitt Romney's worst wounds in 2012 -- the colorful ""vulture capitalist"" label -- was not concocted by Democrats. It was handed to them by none other than Newt Gingrich. None of that among Dems.Cooper's approach was tough but fair. He enforced time limits leniently and got back to every candidate with promised rebuttal time.And honestly, given the obvious kumbaya spirit onstage among fellow progressives acknowledging Clinton's dominating lead so far, Cooper might have been hard-pressed to get them fighting much.Sanders, in a clearly-rehearsed line, even came to Clinton's defense at one point, saying he was sick and tired of the ""damn"" email story when there were far more important issues for Democrats to address. (Loud applause.)She gave him a handshake and happy cackle right there. Other rewards could arrive in a Clinton administration. More email talk, however, will come next week when Clinton finally appears before the House Select Benghazi Committee.Sanders did not shy away from his socialist label and did not disappoint his Sanderistas. He said the United States should be like Denmark -- billions more spent on infrastructure, healthcare for all, free college for everyone, everything financed by the rich who will pay ""a helluva lot more taxes"" in a Sanders presidency.No wonder there's no Sanders PAC.The 74-year-old bemoaned youth unemployment of 36% among Hispanics and 51% among African-Americans, without noting that an African-American Democrat has been president these last 81 months, 24 of them with complete control of Congress.Clinton also strangely noted, ""The economy does better when you have a Democrat in the White House."" So, uh....?Clinton answered a flip-flop question with a gift for GOP ad-makers: ""I never took a position on Keystone until I took a position on Keystone.""None of these folks was fleeing Obama, however. Several times Clinton even heaped praise on her ex-boss. Then added, ""For me, this is about bringing our country together again. And I will do everything I can to heal the divides."" Which came from where, do you suppose?Americans may not trust her. They may think she's a devout patron of political expediency. But that said, Clinton gave Democrats no more reason to drop her yet, always a front-runner's fear. And she gave Joe Biden no more reason to jump in. She looked quite comfortable, not defensive, well-prepared but less scripted, even good-humored at her own expense.Television viewers do not see that during commercials at these debates, candidates walk around, confer with staff and make a quick bathroom run. As the nationwide cable audience returned to the Wynn hotel in Las Vegas after the two-hour break, Clinton could be seen hustling onstage barely in time to rejoin the four men by their podiums.Cooper welcomed her back, to inside audience laughter at the close call.""You know,"" said a smiling Clinton, ""It does take me a little longer.""RELATED:The Democratic debate: What was expectedTrump makes a new deal: I'll behave better -- laterObama declares Russia's Putin is weak and no challengeJoe Biden still very seriously considering a -- Oh, look, a squirrel!

Some of those stocks have sold off on Apple's weaker-than-expected iPhone sales in its fiscal Q3 ended June 27.Skyworks and Avago had been among the best-performing stocks in 2014 and early 2015, but they've fallen in the past couple of months.""Information technology stocks are the most exposed to China, with 10% of revenues generated in the region,"" said Kostin in the report.

Sands shares were up 4.6% to 54.90 in midafternoon trading in the stock market today, Thursday.Sands reported year-over-year earnings per share growth until last quarter, when its EPS plunged 32%. Consensus is for EPS growth to continue shrinking the rest of this year. Still, Sands stock crossed above its 50-day line Thursday and was on track for a third straight higher close.Wynn Resorts (WYNN) was up 7% and MGM Resorts International (MGM), which is less exposed to Macau, rose 3%. Hong Kong-based Melco Crown Entertainment (MPEL), another big casino company in Macau, climbed 7%.Like Credit Suisse, other market-watchers see light at the end of the tunnel after a yearlong Macau recession, triggered by slowing economic growth in China, tighter regulations by Chinese officials in the special administrative district, and a smoking ban that kept some gamblers away.Market-tracker Union Gaming Research noted Wednesday that Macau's gambling revenue remained soft in May, rising 6.2% overall from April but falling 37.1% from May 2014.Still, Union Gaming analyst Chris Jones said in a report that he sees some signs of stability ahead, with tailwinds starting in June.""We continue to view June as a transitional month as trends should ... improve given the easier comparisons to June 2014.""Wells Fargo analyst Cameron McKnight sees improvement in Macau but expects growth to be permanently lower than its earlier, boisterous growth days.""Based on current trends, we believe June gaming revenue decline could be closer to 30% year over year. Given this weakness, we see downside risk to our Q2 and 2015 estimates. We remain neutral on Macau gaming as estimates and valuations adjust to a 'new normal' "" of lower growth.Follow James DeTar on Twitter: @IBD_JDeTar.

698,WYNN,"Stock futures dropped out of narrowly mixed trade to hefty losses ahead of Wednesday's open, after a disappointing Q1 GDP report.Dow futures sank 62.1 points below fair market value. Nasdaq 100 futures dropped 12.7 points. S&P; 500 futures fell 6.3 points.The stock market today is likely to be strung between earnings news, reaction to the early GDP report and this afternoon's release of a policy statement, following the Federal Open Market Committee's two-day meeting. The market showed some positive action, recovering early losses to finish narrowly mixed. The S&P; 500 held below its recent resistance level near 2120. But the Nasdaq's action hinted at possible support near 5000.Economic news opened on a weak note, with the Commerce Department's initial estimate showing the economy expanded a scant 0.2% in the first quarter. That was a serious downshift from Q4's 2.2% gain and sorely below consensus expectations for a 1% increase. Prices slipped 0.1% during the quarter, according to the GDP Price Index, reversing Q4's 0.1% increase and below projections for a 0.5% rise. The weak reading focuses even more attention on this afternoon's Fed announcement.Pending home sales numbers for March are expected from the National Association of Realtors at 10 a.m. ET. The Federal Open Market Committee's policy statement is set for 2 p.m.Despite the mildly mixed stance among stock futures prior to the release of Q1 GDP estimates, a number of leading stocks were volatile ahead of the open. Buffalo Wild Wings (BWLD) dived 10% after reporting results late Tuesday. Wynn Resorts (WYNN) was also down 10%, while Starwood Hotels & Resorts (HOT) surged 9%.GoPro (GPRO) vaulted 11% before the open. The maker of digital video cameras reported late Tuesday its first-quarter sales and earnings topped expectations. The stock has been climbing off a March low, ending Tuesday 52% below its October high.Twitter (TWTR) was down a mild 2% in premarket trade, but with its feather still seriously ruffled after diving 18% Tuesday upon the leaked release of its disappointing Q1 results. The company had intended to release results after the close. Tuesday's loss sent the stock well below key levels of support, and snuffed its attempt to climb above a cup-with-handle base.

709,WYNN,"Shares of Las Vegas Sands (LVS) and other Macau-centric casinos fell hard Tuesday on a report that Macau's government may cap the number of tourists coming from inland China. Credit Suisse revised its forecast for Macau casinos downward.Macau's government has decided to fight a decline in visitors that's led to its worst financial slump ever by — wait for it — proposing a cap on the number of visitors.Macau Business, a news publisher, said the government of the former Portuguese colony, now a special administrative district like Hong Kong, is proposing to China's government that the number of mainland tourists allowed to visit Macau be limited to fewer than 21 million a year.It wants to cap China tourists, who are mainly middle-class gamblers, to focus on attracting more high-roller VIP category gamblers, the report said. VIP gamblers are fewer in number but spend more, and most don't come from the mainland.Macau casinos' total revenue has already plunged amid tighter regulations by China's government and the shrinking growth rate of China's economy.Last year, Macau reported its first decline in year-to-year revenue, and the slump has continued this year.Macau's plan could backfire if the number of tourists from China falls and it isn't able to boost global tourist count. That could cause more pain for Sands, Wynn Resorts (WYNN), MGM Resorts International (MGM) and others.Sterne Agee analyst David Bain said Macau's government may be posturing, saying ""a key Macau contact with political insight suggests that comments regarding limiting visitation growth acts as a lever to address the mainland for additional (much needed/desired) land allowance for Macau for resident housing, etc.""Bain expects a 35% year-to-year decline in Macau gambling revenue in April. He doesn't expect much improvement in Macau until later this year, although by midyear the situation should be ""less bad.""Credit Suisse analyst Kenneth Fong on Tuesday cut his first-quarter forecast for Macau gross gambling revenue to a range of 23% shrinkage to 9% growth, from an earlier forecast of 21% reduction to 10% growth.And ""with fundamentals continuing to weaken"" and valuation of Macau casinos relatively high, ""gaming names may see downside here,"" Fong said.Sands shares gapped down 4% in strong volume in Tuesday afternoon trading in the stock market today.The world's biggest casino company's stock price is down 37% from a six-year high set in March 2014, and it fell below its 50-day average Tuesday.Wynn Resorts skidded nearly 5% and MGM,which has less exposure in Macau, fell 1%.

Last year, Caesars split into two companies: casino operator Caesars Entertainment and Caesars Acquisition (CACQ), which was set up to acquire online gambling sites.The push for online gambling in the U.S. has stalled this year, partly because it's opposed by the CEO of the world's largest casino company, Las Vegas Sands (LVS), as well as by the CEO of Wynn Resorts (WYNN). Both companies get the bulk of their earnings from Macau casinos.With negotiations shelved for now, Caesars must decide whether to move forward with bankruptcy without its biggest debt holders on board or continue to try to come to terms with them before it proceeds, the report said.Caesars operates more than 50 casinos in the U.S. and Europe, including Las Vegas, Atlantic City and other U.S. locales.

724,WYNN,"Macau-centric casinos such as Las Vegas Sands got a glimmer of hope Friday in a report that the number of visitors to the world's most popular gaming destination rose to 2.41 million, up 3% last month vs. the same month a year earlier .But it's unclear whether the rise in visitors will translate into a revenue increase for Macau casinos.The report comes ahead of Wynn Resorts' (WYNN) third-quarter earnings, slated for Tuesday after the market closes.The consensus of 19 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters is for Wynn to report $1.84 earnings per share for the September-ending quarter, unchanged from a year ago, and a 1.8% drop in revenue to about $1.37 billion.Like Las Vegas Sands (LVS), MGM Resorts International (MGM) and Hong Kong-based Melco Crown Entertainment (MPEL), Wynn gets the bulk of its revenue from its Macau casinos.Macau finance secretary Francis Tam, in an interview with Macau radio and TV broadcaster Teledifusao de Macau, last week forecast the city's drop in casino revenue will worsen in October, and projected that recovery won't come until the second half of 2015.Meanwhile, the number of visitors from inland China to Macau, on China's southern coast across the strait from Hong Kong, rose 6% to nearly 1.6 million last month, macaubusiness.com reported, citing government figures.The number of visitors from South Korea and Japan rose, too. But the numbers from Hong Kong and Taiwan fell amid recent democracy protests in Hong Kong that curbed travel to and from the island.Investors are looking for any sign of upturn in the battered casino sector after stocks plunged over the summer and the downturn extended into fall.The slump in Macau came as China's economic growth slowed, and China's government tightened credit rules and cracked down on casinos amid a broad anti-corruption campaign. A smoking ban on Macau casinos that goes into effect this month also turned off some gamblers.June showed the first year-over-year monthly decline in Macau gambling revenue in five years. Revenue has now fallen an unprecedented five months in a row, according to Macau's Gaming Inspection and Coordination Bureau.Wynn shares were up fractionally in Friday-afternoon trading on the stock market today.Sands, the world's largest casino company, rose more than 6% on Oct. 16 after it lifted its dividend 30% and reported higher Q3 earnings but lower revenue, missing estimates on both.

766,WYNN,"Follow James DeTar on Twitter: @IBD_JDeTar.Just when it looked like Las Vegas Sands (LVS) and others might see an upturn from a deep summer slump, Hong Kong protests have taken some of the wind out of their sails.Macau was looking to Golden Week, a two-week celebration that starts on Oct. 1 every year, to boost revenue this month.But Hong Kong protests, labor unrest in Macau, an ongoing anticorruption campaign and other factors threaten to derail Macau's recovery, at least for now.Hundreds of casino workers in Macau walked off the job on Friday, Voice of America said. The report quoted a union leader there saying workers are demanding higher wages and better benefits. It was the latest in a wave of labor unrest to hit casinos facing shrinking revenues.Still, shares of Las Vegas casinos that operate in Macau, including Sands, MGM Resorts International (MGM) and Wynn Resorts (WYNN) rose Friday afternoon. They've stabilized a bit recently amid a slowly accelerating recovery in Las Vegas and a rising number of casinos in various states besides Nevada.Wells Fargo analyst Cameron McKnight said in a report Friday that Macau casinos are in trouble in part on protests in — and travel suspensions to and from — Hong Kong amid continuing protests by pro-democracy activists to persuade the government to open local elections to all candidates.""Investor sentiment (on Macau-centric casinos) is definitely more negative/cautious than a month ago, though we don't feel we're at the bottom,"" McKnight said.Many investors also misread a report in China Daily on Tuesday that said ""a campaign to put a check on misbehavior by party officials may just be ending,"" he said.The campaign that's ending was just one facet of a larger anticorruption drive by China's Communist Party that also targets Macau junket operators who lend money to high rolling VIPs in Macau, he said.Gamblers get loans from junket operators to get around Chinese rules that strictly limit the amount of cash visitors can bring into Macau.Wells Fargo's checks with Macau contacts suggest ""the anticorruption drive could ramp and persist for some time.""

China cracked down on what it said were illegal lending practices in Macau, and new rules including a smoking ban in casinos have driven some players away.Chinese officials arrested some lenders in Macau earlier this year, saying they illegally used the government-sanctioned credit-card system to get around rules that limit how much cash Chinese citizens can bring into the former Portuguese colony.The crackdown made some gamblers uncomfortable, analysts said, so they stayed away.Chinese newspaper China Daily on Tuesday said a campaign to put a check on misbehavior by Chinese party officials may be ending.""The campaign has reached its goals,"" the report quoted the Communist Party of China saying in a statement. The report noted that ""lavish banquets and entertainment at VIP clubs,"" such as those at Macau casino resorts, were targets of the crackdown.Las Vegas casinos also may have gotten a boost from a Bloomberg report that a Japanese lawmaker backing a bill to legalize casinos in that country said he expects the bill to win approval in Japan's lower house as early as next month.Casinos have plans on the drawing board to build Macau-like casino resorts there if the bill passes.Sands shares were up 4.3% in afternoon trading on the stock market today.

827,WYNN,"Follow James DeTar on Twitter: @IBD_JDeTar.Las Vegas Sands (LVS) and other Macau-centric casinos could be in trouble in the waning months of 2014 after Hong Kong, about 40 miles across the strait from Macau, on Friday cut its full-year economic forecast.Hong Kong officials now see the economy expanding 2%-3% this year, down from a February projection of 3%-4% growth, after data showed gross Q2 domestic product fell 0.1% vs. the prior quarter, below analyst estimates.Hong Kong Financial Secretary John Tsang said on his blog that purchases of watches, jewelry, electronics and other high-end goods fell sharply.""Annual investment spending fell markedly; private consumption over the same period recorded only a slight increase,"" he said, adding performance for those sectors was the worst since Q1 of 2009.Macau casino resorts rely on tourists from throughout China and nearby Asian countries, as well as affluent VIP customers from around the globe.Gambling revenue for the world's top casino destination has contracted in recent months amid a perfect storm of factors. Among them: China has made it harder to get credit amid a deliberate belt-tightening.And gamblers, especially VIPs, have shied away due to a crackdown by the Chinese government on junket operators and pawnshop lenders. China says some lenders use the government-backed debit/credit card system to illegally launder money.Wells Fargo analyst Cameron McKnight, citing the government crackdown, began warning early this year that the second half would be choppy for Sands, Wynn Resorts (WYNN) and MGM Resorts International (MGM), which rely on Macau for the bulk of their revenue and growth.On Friday, McKnight said the situation is deteriorating. ""With slowing mass (middle-class tourist spending) growth in July and few signs of improvement in August, trends have turned from choppy to rocky,"" he said in a report.Wells Fargo cut its stock price target for Sands from 90-100 to 80-85, and for Wynn from 260-270 to 245-250.Additionally, ""We are reducing our 2H14 Macau market total revenue growth estimate from 4% to -2% on lower mass market revenue growth assumptions,"" McKnight said.Still, McKnight projects Macau casino growth will resume eventually as the effects of these factors are absorbed. ""We remain bullish on the medium and long-term outlook. We see a $100 billion-plus Macau market over the next five years,"" up from about $50 billion currently, he said.Sands shares were down 1.4% in midday trading in the stock market today.

985,WYNN,"A pair of reports confirming falling revenue for Macau gambling proved a losing hand for Las Vegas Sands (LVS) and other Macau-centric casinos.Wells Fargo analyst Cameron McKnight said Macau gaming revenue for July fell 3.6% to $3.5 billion. The drop came amid a crackdown on practices by local lenders who allegedly used credit cards to illegally launder money. Some of those lenders have been arrested as a result.Visitors to Macau routinely borrow money to get around restrictions on the amount of cash that can be brought into the special district across the strait from Hong Kong.The crackdown includes tighter restrictions on lenders that make it harder for visitors to borrow, causing some, especially high-roller VIP gamblers, to stay away.The revenue drop was led by a 13.9% slide in VIP gaming, mostly from baccarat play. Mass market (middle class tourist) revenue rose 17%, but that was the weakest growth since the bank started tracking Macau casinos in 2010.McKnight said Macau ""revenues did not improve materially in the back half of July, which could mean mainland China's political initiatives, and potentially transit visa changes, are impacting premium mass"" gambling revenue.In a separate report, Deutsche Bank lowered its third-quarter and full-year 2014 revenue forecast for Macau.Deutsche Bank analyst Carlo Santarelli expects Q3 revenue to fall 0.9% vs. the same quarter a year ago and full year revenue to grow 6.5%, well below the region's usual growth rates, and down from his earlier outlook for 3% Q3 growth and 8.6% for the full year.Deutsche Bank also lowered its August gross gaming revenue forecast to a mild 3% increase ""to account for softer VIP volume and mass revenue trends against a tough comparison"" vs. the same month a year ago, StreetInsider quoted Santarelli as saying in the report.Las Vegas Sands shares were down more than 4% at 68.93 in Wednesday afternoon trading on the stock market today.Other large Las Vegas casinos with operations in Macau dived.

1122,WYNN,"The drive to legalize online gambling throughout the U.S. is gaining momentum, but the heads of the world's largest casino companies are divided on what could be an $8 billion market.MGM Resorts International (MGM) CEO Jim Murren and Caesars Entertainment (CZR) CEO Gary Loveman support it.""Gamers and casinos — those two industries are converging,"" Murren told IBD recently.""We think that's a good thing. There's a business opportunity if it's regulated pristinely, preferably at the federal level.""Caesars also has spun off Caesars Acquisition (CACQ), whose goal is to acquire online gaming sites and technology. Most of the rest of the U.S. casino industry, which generates more than $37 billion in revenue a year, supports legalizing online gambling.But Las Vegas Sands  (LVS) CEO Sheldon Adelson is vehemently against it, and Wynn Resorts (WYNN) CEO Steve Wynn has withdrawn his earlier backing.Possible FrameworkDespite this opposition, Nevada and Delaware recently took what many see as a significant step toward national legal online gambling.Last month they signed a compact — similar to the ones states use to enable multistate lotteries — that lets gamblers in both states play on sites based in each other's state.The agreement is for online poker only, but market tracker Union Gaming noted in a report that it is the first of its kind and ""could serve as a framework for future interstate compacts.""The two states hope to build on the Justice Department's 2011 decision to allow online gambling, except for sports betting, even though it limits betting to residents within a state playing on sites based in that state.Nevada, New Jersey and Delaware were the first to offer online gaming. Struggling Atlantic City venues are betting online games will drive interest in playing at casinos rather than encourage players to just stay at home.Other states, still licking wounds from the recession and looking to boost tax revenues, are mulling legalization too.They won't get any help from Adelson, who has said online betting will open the door to minors gambling and to unscrupulous sites preying on vulnerable people.In January, he launched the Coalition to Stop Internet Gambling, which is calling on Congress to pass a federal ban on Internet gambling.An opposing group, the Coalition for Consumer and Online Protection, has formed with backing from MGM Resorts, the American Gaming Association and the Poker Players Alliance, among others.MGM's Murren says the industry must be ""absolutely vigilant and tireless"" in shutting down illegal gambling sites and warns they could damage the overall industry.""From our perspective at MGM, the most important dimension of the debate has to be on law enforcement,"" he said.Adelson may have found an ally in his bid to hold back the online gambling trend.888 Holdings On HoldUntil recently, Steve Wynn was preparing his company for online gaming. In September he agreed to have U.K.-based 888 Holdings develop his resort's online poker offerings.But in a January interview with industry tracker Jon Ralston at RalstonReports.com, Wynn said he now agrees with Adelson.Wynn added later it's possible he could change his mind again.""This is not a good entrepreneurial opportunity,"" he told Ralston. ""Where's the business opportunity? The big problem I see is I don't see the government letting us keep the money.""Wynn has since put its partnership with 888 Holdings on hold.Meantime, 888 is working with regulators in states considering legalizing online gambling to educate them about safety and security issues.888 CEO Brian Mattingley said in an interview with IBD that based on his conversations with analysts, the online gambling market could reach $5 billion-$8 billion when it matures.""The opportunity in the U.S. is going to be enormous,"" he said.

1185,WYNN,"At least 10 states are considering legalizing or expanding online gambling this year, but the CEOs of casino giants Las Vegas Sands (LVS) and Wynn Resorts (WYNN) are trying to hold back the building momentum.In 2013, three states launched legal online gambling: New Jersey, Nevada and Delaware. Gambling Compliance said 10 states are either mulling legislation to legalize online gambling or plan to expand their online gambling franchise.Those states are California, Colorado, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Mississippi, New Jersey (which plans to expand) and Pennsylvania.New Jersey, which has seen Atlantic City's gaming business steadily drop, has already introduced legislation to allow casinos to offer online games in other states and overseas, Gambling Compliance said.Some industry observers see it as a promising avenue for growth, and Caesars Entertainment (CZR) late last year split into two, creating a separate company to focus on the online gaming market.Analysts see it as a gambit to return the company to profitability by being an early entrant in what some estimate could grow to a $7.4 billion business in the U.S. by 2017.But the heads of Las Vegas Sands and Wynn Resorts, two of the largest U.S. casinos by revenue, are opposed.Casino mogul Sheldon Adelson, head of Sands, has been outspoken in his criticism, saying online gaming would be too difficult to regulate and could lead, for example, to online gambling by minors.He was joined recently by Steve Wynn, founder and head of Wynn Resorts. He argued that the business model is weak and was quoted in an interview on gambling site Ralston Reports saying, ""I don't see the government letting us keep the money.""Wynn may still be hedging his bets. The AP reported Monday that New Jersey gambling regulators approved Wynn Resorts' bid to offer an Internet gambling site in the state.The company later said its Wynn Interactive unit will study the market before actually launching online gambling in New Jersey.Las Vegas Sands and Caesars were down about 1% in Wednesday afternoon trading on the stock market today.

1188,WYNN,"Las Vegas hit a winning streak in May as gambling revenue surged 17% compared with the same month last year. That could lift shares of Las Vegas Sands (LVS) and other Vegas-based casinos.Nevada's Gaming Control Board said Friday that gambling revenue hit $592.9 million in May, up from $505.4 million a year earlier. Year to date, its gambling revenue is up 3.9%. For Nevada statewide, including Lake Tahoe and Reno casinos in northern Nevada, revenue grew 8.1% to $970.3 million in May compared with May '13.Union Gaming analyst Robert Shore said the 17% growth figure was the highest for Las Vegas since November 2013, when revenue surged 22.6%.""The results are encouraging,"" Shore told IBD, adding, ""Las Vegas is still an aspirational place where people want to come to see shows and gamble.""Wells Fargo analyst Cameron McKnight agreed: ""We view these results positively for our Las Vegas Strip exposed coverage,"" including Sands and smaller rivals MGM Resorts International (MGM) and Wynn Resorts (WYNN), which all have casinos both in Las Vegas and Chinese gambling hot spot Macau.Vegas casinos have been losing ground for years to Macau, the top global casino destination.But VIP gamblers have shied away from Macau this year amid a crackdown on lenders who provide money to visitors there, so Las Vegas may have picked up some of that high-rolling business for the month.Shore notes Las Vegas Strip baccarat revenue in May exploded, rising nearly 90% to $170.9 million.Asked whether this indicates Vegas may regain market share from Macau, he said the monthly gain was more of an event-driven improvement. May included an extra Saturday vs. a year ago and a major sporting event in Vegas.""Baccarat play, in particular, tends to be event-driven, and in May players came to see (Floyd) Mayweather"" win a title fight against challenger Marcos Maidana at the Las Vegas MGM Grand Hotel.Sands shares eased fractionally in afternoon trading in the stock market today, Friday.

Many are the first to report for their given industry, giving investors a particular interest in analyzing the financials and outlooks.Here are six of the most important earnings reports on tap.TuesdayCharles Schwab (SCHW) was a pioneering discount brokerage, but it's still blazing new trails. Schwab shares hit a 13-year high on March 21. The stock consolidated and attempted a breakout on July 3. It fell back as the market sold off, though in light volume. Schwab rose 0.7% to 27.10 on the stock market Friday.Wall Street expects Schwab to report a 28% earnings per share gain to 23 cents. That would snap 3 quarters of accelerating growth.J.P. Morgan Chase (JPM) has had a tough time of late. Once deemed the best-run Wall Street bank, JPMorgan Chase has paid billions of dollars in various settlements. Mortgage activity has slowed — affecting many lenders — while fixed-income trading seems permanently depressed. JPMorgan said in a SEC filing that it expected Q2 market revenues down 20% vs. a year earlier. Finally, the company reported on July 1 that CEO Jamie Dimon has throat cancer, though that should be ""curable.""Shares have retreated since hitting a 14-year high in late March.JPMorgan earnings likely fell 19% to $1.29 a share, matching Q1's 19% year-over-year decline. JPMorgan is just one of several major bank earnings. Wells Fargo (WFC) reported earnings Friday. Citigroup (C) reports Monday, with Goldman Sachs (GS) joining JPMorgan on Tuesday. Bank of America (BAC) results are due Wednesday.Intel (INTC) has seen a rebirth in recent months, with shares recently hitting a 10-year high, in the wake of solid Q1 results in early April and then upwardly revised revenue guidance on June 12. Intel is benefitting from the recent revival in corporate PC sales after Microsoft (MSFT) stopped supporting the venerable Windows operating system.Intel earnings should show a 33% gain to 52 cents a share, following yearly changes of -5%, 6%, 0%, -28% in the prior four quarters. Investors will want to have some indication if PC sales will remain strong in the second half of the year, or if Intel will find some other way to expand.Yahoo (YHOO) earnings will rise 9% to 38 cents a share, following Q1's flat reading. Q1 revenue edged higher, as display ad sales climbed 2%, offering some hope that CEO Marissa Mayer can generate top-line growth. Still, Yahoo's most important news may be about Alibaba. Yahoo owns a minority stake in the Chinese e-commerce giant, and it gives some headline figures on Alibaba's results.Alibaba's planned U.S. IPO is widely expected to take place in August. Yahoo will sell a significant share of its existing holdings as part of the offering.Yahoo shares have been in a downtrend since hitting a decade-best in early January.WednesdayLas Vegas Sands (LVS) is the world's largest casino operator. Despite its name, Sands — like Wynn Resorts (WYNN) and MGM Resorts (MGM) — gets the bulk of its revenue and profit from Macau, China's gaming enclave and the world's largest gambling site. Macau growth has slowed in recent months amid a crackdown on moneylenders in the area. But there are some signs that the worst is over for Macau. Meanwhile, Las Vegas casino revenue has been solid.Las Vegas Sands earnings should show a 40% gain to 91 cents a share, analysts predicted. That would the second straight quarter of moderate acceleration.But Sands stock has been in a modest downtrend for the past four months, falling below its 50- and 200-day moving averages last week.ThursdayGoogle (GOOGL) is involved in many ventures, from self-driving cars to alternative-energy investments to Android mobile software. The open-source Android has become the global leader over Apple (AAPL) iOS. It's a direct money-maker, though it likely does help boost mobile ad revenue. Search-based ads remain the bulk of Google's business. But it's a good business: Earnings likely rose 31% to $6.26 a share. That would follow decelerating growth for the past two quarters to just 8% in Q1.Google shares hit a record high of 615.05 in late February. The stock consolidated and has been building a handle on its cup base. Google (GOOG) Class C shares, which started trading on April 3, are near a new highFollow Ed Carson on Twitter: @IBD_ECarson.RELATED:Wells Fargo Q2 Earnings Growth Slows As Banks Report

Economists had forecast a more mild 0.6% slip. The bulk of the miss was apparently due to a sharp decline in aircraft orders during the month. Minus transportation, durable goods orders rose 0.5% — in line with expectations. So far this year, durable goods orders are running 2.2% below last year's January to May period.
"
1311,WYNN,"Housing prices improved steadily in May, lifting the Federal Housing Finance Agency's House Price Index 0.3%. That increase was equal to March's increase but just below consensus forecasts for a 0.4% gain. Year over year, the index is up 5.3%.

The stock popped to a new high, paring some gains but holding just above a cup-base buy point of 70.48.

1585,WYNN,"Sands shares rose 1% in afternoon trading Monday on the stock market today. MGM and Wynn also rose.Top casino operators Las Vegas Sands (LVS), MGM Resorts International (MGM) and Wynn Resorts (WYNN) are expected to keep growing in China, as Beijing invests billions to attract visitors to Macau, a new report said.Gambling revenue in Macau is on track for a 15%-17% rise for the month of November vs. a year earlier, RBC Capital Markets said Monday, up from its prior estimate for a 12% increase.RBC analyst John Kempf said the estimate is based on the city's $1.25 billion in gambling revenue for the first 10 days of this month. He recommends investors with stock in the three casino companies let it ride.In 2012, Macau gambling revenue was $38 billion, and analysts' consensus is that it will be around $44 billion this year.Sands, MGM and Wynn get the bulk of their revenue from Macau. But it can't keep growing quickly forever, Kempf noted, and some investors wonder whether it's time to take money off the table and sell shares in related companies.""Our answer, particularly in light of the recent growth rates, is not now,"" Kempf said in a client note.""And with no new supply (of casino resorts) until mid-2015, infrastructure projects supporting new demand, and signs that the China economy is at least stabilizing, the demand-supply imbalance could last for the foreseeable future.""He has an ""outperform"" rating on all three companies.China is building what is expected to be the world's most expensive high-speed rail system to bring middle-class Chinese to the coastal tourist spot.It's also building a bridge from Macau to Hong Kong and a new airport, which will be the second major airport to serve Macau.But Kempf cautioned there are several issues percolating that need to be watched.Among them are rising labor costs as the standard of living improves in China, pressure from China's government on casinos to diversify to more family-oriented entertainment, and competition from resorts on Hainan Island, where there are no travel restrictions like there are in Macau.Nevertheless, Kempf said, ""As for now, we remain bullish on the near-term prospects of Macau and buyers of Macau-related names.""Sands shares rose 1% in afternoon trading Monday on the stock market today.

Caesars said it's cooperating with federal officials.Rivals Wynn Resorts (WYNN) and MGM Resorts International (MGM) are bidding for Massachusetts licenses too, but Caesars claimed the state's requirements are ""unprecedented.""""It's going to be very difficult for sophisticated, multi-jurisdictional operators to tolerate the environment this commission has created,"" Caesars CEO Gary Loveman told reporters Sunday.The company said it was pulling out after Suffolk Downs said it had severed its partnership with the casino to build a $1 billion resort casino at the racetrack.Massachusetts' gaming commission earlier said in a report it had concerns about Caesars' debt and ties to a New York hotel with possible links to organized crime.Caesars in March said it planned to spend $185 million to transform the aging Bill's Gamblin' Hall in Las Vegas into a boutique hotel using the Gansevoort name.Earlier, an investor in New York-based Gansevoort Hotel Group was identified in German court filings as possibly having ties to organized crime in Russia, a 2012 report in the New York Post said.

1661,WYNN,"Stocks mustered small gains in a choppy session Monday. Despite the gains, the day still belonged to the bears. The S&P 500 edged up 0.2%, closing at a record high. The Nasdaq also climbed 0.2% after touching a fresh 13-year high. The Nasdaq and the S&P 500 were up as much as 0.5% and 0.4%, respectively. The small-cap Russell 2000…

1662,WYNN,"Things are looking up for Casino stocks and ETFs. VanEck Vectors Gaming ETF (BJK  -  Free Report) has gained about 7.2% so far this year (as of May 14, 2018), beating the S&P 500 (up 1.3%) on a volley of favorable happenings in the space. On Monday, casino stocks jumped on the news of legalization of sports betting in several U.S. states. The casino ETF BJK in fact added 2.2% on May 14 (read: Basket March Madness Gains With These ETFs).The Supreme Court annulled a federal law that bans sports gambling in a breakthrough decision that allows states to legalize betting on sports. The court ruled 6-3 to invalidate the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act, a 1992 law. Per the older law, a person could bet on the outcome of a single game only in Nevada.Is the New Rule a Mid-Term Harm to Renowned Casino Stocks?The court's decision now potentially permits legal sports betting in several states like New Jersey, Delaware, Mississippi, New York, Pennsylvania, West Virginia and possibly nationwide. The ruling will end Nevada's monopoly on the sports gambling practice, which earns billions of dollars annually. Some states expect sports betting as a good source of tax revenues, per CNBC.But since Nevada-based casino operators are likely to lose on the monopoly under the new rule, the likes of Wynn Resorts (WYNN  -  Free Report) and Las Vegas Sands (LVS  -  Free Report), Nevada-heavy casino companies, saw shares sliding following the Court decision, per CNBC.WYNN was down 2.1% on May 14 and LVS lost about 0.9%. Instead, companies like Churchill Downs Inc. (CHDN  -  Free Report) and Penn National Gaming Inc. (PENN  -  Free Report) benefited more on the news and added about 4.6% each on Monday.No Major Threat: Macau & Earnings Are PositivesMajor gaming companies like WYNN, LVS and MGM Resorts (MGM  -  Free Report) have wide exposure to China apart from the United States. And a surge in gaming revenues in Macau — a Chinese territory and “the country’s only legal casino hub” — should help these companies tide over the sports betting monopoly issue in Nevada.Gambling revenues in Macau jumped 27.6% in April and beat analyst expectations of an 18-22% rise thanks to solid demand. April represented the 21st consecutive month of gaming revenue gains.  However, revenues are still off the highs seen in 2014, per Reuters.Overall, the earnings picture is also positive. MGM Resorts International’s adjusted earnings of 34 cents for the first quarter of 2018 beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 31 cents. Total revenues of $2.82 billion surpassed the consensus estimate of $2.80 billion by 0.7% and increased 3.9% year over year. MGM China’s net revenues increased 25% while net revenues from the company's domestic resorts declined 1%.Las Vegas Sands’ adjusted earnings per share of 88 cents surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 77 cents by 14.3% and increased 41.9% year over year on higher revenues. Net revenues of $3.4 billion beat the consensus mark by 6.3% and increased 11.7% year over year. The solid performance can be attributed to services across Macao and Singapore operations.Among the trio, Wynn Resorts seems to suffer more. The company beat on both lines in Q1 but Wynn Macau revenues climbed 11.9%, which fell below our exclusive non-financial metrics consensus estimate of $638 million.Better to Play Casino ETF BJK?Against this backdrop, it is intriguing to play the casino gaming ETF BJK as it gives exposure to a wider array of casino stocks, irrespective of location specifics. The basket approach actually minimizes stock-specific risks (see all Consumer Discretionary ETFs here).The fund holds 45 stocks in total. Galaxy Entertainment (8.3%), Las Vegas Sands (8.1%), Sands China (6.9%), Aristocrat Leisure (6.3%) and MGM Resorts (6.3%) are the top five holdings. The United States has about 42% exposure while China and Australia take the next two spots.

1663,WYNN,"Dividends have been the consistent source of income for investors seeking regular returns during both bull and bear markets. According to a study, dividends accounted for an average 52% of the total returns over the past seven decades.This is especially true as these stocks offer the best of both these worlds — safety in the form of payouts and stability in the form of mature companies that are less volatile to large swings in stock prices. The companies that offer dividends generally act as a hedge against economic uncertainty and provide downside protection by offering outsized payouts or sizable yields on a regular basis (see: all the Large Cap ETFs here).Q2 Dividends Payout Hits Record Overall, the S&P 500 companies declared a record $124 billion in dividend payouts during the second quarter, up 11% from $112 billion in the year-ago quarter. About 89 firms hiked their payouts versus 67 firms a year ago, while 332 have maintained their dividends versus 347 in the same period last year. Notably, 43 companies have retained the ‘aristocrat’ status of 25 years of consecutive dividend raises. This is primarily thanks to a strong economy, solid earnings, historic tax cuts and results from the second round of Federal Reserve stress tests.Among the special attractions were Citrix Systems (CTXS  -  Free Report), which declared a dividend for the first time with a payout of 35 cents, and Dr Pepper Snapple , which announced a special dividend of $103.75 due to merger activity. Lam Research (LRCX  -  Free Report), Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE  -  Free Report), Wynn Resorts (WYNN  -  Free Report), Ralph Lauren (RL  -  Free Report) and Starbucks (SBUX  -  Free Report) were among the firms that hiked dividend payouts (read: 4 Dividend Growth ETFs to Watch as Global Dividends Top).The trend is expected to continue in the coming months as most large companies have huge cash piles on their balance sheet and are in a position to increase payouts to shareholders. Additionally, the new tax law encourages the companies to bring their overseas cash back home at much more reduced rates and distribute parts of it to their shareholders. Per Bloomberg, an additional 75 companies will boost dividend payouts this quarter.Investors should also note that a company which consistently increases its dividend has stronger fundamentals, suggesting rising cash flows, good liquidity and a strong balance sheet.How to PlayGiven this, investors could tap growing dividends in the form of ETFs. Below, we have highlighted five popular dividend ETFs that offer excellent dividend growth potential, any of which could be a solid pick for investor in the long term: Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF (VIG  -  Free Report)This is the largest and most popular ETF in the dividend space with AUM of $27.8 billion and average daily volume of about 797,000 shares.

1664,WYNN,"“Should you find yourself in a chronically leaking boat, energy devoted to changing vessels is likely to be more productive than energy devoted to patching leaks.”- Warren Buffett.At the moment, the quote fits perfectly for MGM Resorts International (MGM  -  Free Report) as the company’s near-term future looks bleak. In fact, investors need to exercise extreme caution when it comes to the stock as it is unlikely to show any major improvement moving ahead. In the past six months, shares of MGM Resorts have plunged 17.4%, wider than the industry’s 2% decline.Let’s delve deeper to find out the reasons behind the company’s dismal performance.MGM Resorts Vs Industry Scorecard    Disappointing Macau Revenues a Major ConcernMacau, which is the world’s largest gambling hub, has disappointed investors with lower-than-expected revenues for the second successive month. Gambling revenues from Macau increased 12.5% to 22.49 billion patacas ($2.78 billion) in June. The metric not only lagged analyst expectations but also declined 12% from the figure registered in May. Even though gambling revenues were up for the 23nd straight months, it still remains below the highest level achieved in 2012.Notably, MGM Resorts generates more than 20% of its revenues from Macau region, which declined sharply close on the heels of the news. Other stocks such as Melco Resorts & Entertainment Ltd. (MLCO  -  Free Report), Wynn Resorts, Limited (WYNN  -  Free Report) and Las Vegas Sands Corp. (LVS  -  Free Report), which belong to the same industry and has highest exposure to Macau region, have also declined due to lower-than-expected Macau’s gambling revenues.Furthermore, MGM Resorts operates in the highly competitive markets of Las Vegas and Macau. Increased hotel openings and promotional activities have made these markets highly competitive. Thus, excess supply, especially in the Macau market, might reduce the company’s market share.High DebtMGM Resorts’ heavy reliance on debt financing remains a concern. As of Mar 31, 2018, cash and cash equivalents were $1.5 billion compared with a much higher long-term debt of $12.7 billion. Therefore, any severe slowdown in macroeconomic and credit market conditions in the future may affect the company’s ability to pay or refinance its debt.Estimate RevisionsIn order to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company, let’s look at MGM Resorts earnings estimate revisions. In the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 and 2019 has moved south by 5.7% and 12.5% to $1.33 and $1.61, respectively. For second-quarter 2018, the consensus mark has moved down 11 cents to 27 cents in the same time frame.MGM Resorts currently has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 19X over. Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we're willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation.See Them Free>>

1665,WYNN,"The Supreme Court paves the way for legalized sports betting across the United States, spreading an air of optimism not only for the gaming and casino stocks but also for specialized gambling-technology providers and racetrack operators.This is especially true as the court has abandoned the two-decade old law -- Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA) -- that bars gambling on football, basketball, baseball and other sports basically everywhere in America other than Nevada in the gambling capital Las Vegas. The 6-3 decision ruled, ""Congress can regulate sports gambling directly, but if it elects not to do so, each state is free to act on its own.""The ruling came in a tough fight from New Jersey for years to legalize gambling on sports at casinos and racetracks in the state.A Move to CheerThe news ignited a rally in the gaming stocks, sending most of them to record highs. This is because the ruling will allow legal sports betting in numerous states that could generate hundreds of millions of dollars a year in new revenues. Additionally, it has explored opportunities to open up new sports betting businesses for Americans seeking to bet on sports in a safe and regulated manner. The American Gaming Association estimates that Americans illegally wager about $150 billion on sports each year through off-shore, black market bookies.According to the study by the American Sports Betting Association, the move could add as much as $26 billion to U.S. gross domestic profit, create as many as 152,000 new jobs, and bring in between $4.8 billion and $5.3 billion in new revenues for the states.Per the research firm Eilers & Krejcik Gaming, legal sports betting market may bring in $6.03 billion annually by 2023 while the analyst at Jefferies estimates the market for legal sports betting could be as big as $57 billion nationwide.In particular, the legalization has set the stage for dramatic expansion of the gambling business in New Jersey. Gambling hubs such as Atlantic City and Monmouth Park racetrack are expected to be operational within the next few weeks. The state law at issue would allow people aged 21 and above to bet on sports at New Jersey casinos and racetracks but would ban wagers on college teams based in or playing in the state.Seven states — Connecticut, Delaware, Pennsylvania, Iowa, New York, Mississippi and West Virginia — have already cleared the way for legal sports betting while 13 other states — California, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Michigan, Missouri, Oklahoma, Rhode Island and South Carolina — have plans or proposals to consider legalizing sports betting.However, the move will break up Nevada's monopoly on the practice and could take some sheen away from the likes of Wynn Resorts (WYNN  -  Free Report) and Las Vegas Sands (LVS  -  Free Report). Though it could put some pressure on Nevada’s gambling business, the move would not really hurt the overall casino business. Las Vegas has made great strides toward attracting visitors for more than just gambling, expanding its offerings of entertainment, dining and resort and spa services. Nevada casinos generated $26.2 billion in gambling revenue during 2017, surpassing a record set in the U.S. state prior to the recession in 2007 as per data from the Nevada Gaming Control Board.How to Cash In?That said, investors seeking to capitalize the boom in sports betting could make a play on any of the following stocks:Penn National Gaming Inc.

1666,WYNN,"The U.S. Supreme court announced Monday that it has decided 6-3 to allow states to regulate their own sports gambling, overturning a 1992 law that outlawed sports gambling nationwide except in the state of Nevada where it has been legal for decades.The ruling does not mean that sports gambling is immediately legal across the nation, but rather that states are free to devise their own regulatory structures, potentially allowing betting on sporting events in several states where the move has public support.Nevada-based casinos and collegiate and professional sports leagues have been staunch opponents of an expansion in sports gambling.  Vegas Casinos have had a near-monopoly on legal sports betting which they are reluctant to relinquish.  The NCAA, NFL, NBA and MLB have expressed concern that widespread gambling on their events could incentivize nefarious activity on the part of players, coaches and officials. They also have a bit of an image problem.  Though they are aware that illegal betting on sports increases their gate revenue and viewership by an unquantifiable amount, they (and their sponsors) would prefer to be seen as family entertainment rather than an enterprise that exists purely for gambling - like a horse racing track.Ironically, individual owners of professional sports franchises cheered the news.  Ted Leonsis, owner of the Washington Wizards and Washington Capitals and Mark Cuban, owner of the Dallas Mavericks both applauded the decision for its potential to take a bite out of the illegal gambling market, but also for its potential to increase the value of their holdings.  In what was probably a bit of hyperbole, Cuban said on CNBC Monday, “I think everyone who owns a top four professional sports team just saw the value of their team double.”Several states – most notably New Jersey, who filed the original lawsuit in an attempt to prop up its falling Atlantic City revenues – look likely to quickly approve their own plans to allow sports gambling as quickly as possible.So who will the winners and losers be when sports betting is allowed in much of the U.S.?(It’s worth noting here that obviously the biggest losers will be the proprietors of existing illegal sports betting operations, but since none of those are public companies, we will ignore them here.  The same goes for individual states who will be able to tax sports gambling for the first time.  It might be a big win for state budget coffers, but since you can't invest in them, we’ll ignore them, too.)Existing Casino OperatorsCasino stocks were mixed on the news, with a bright line drawn between the companies that operate primarily in Nevada and those that have properties spread around the rest of the U.S.Wynn Resorts (WYNN  -  Free Report) and Las Vegas Sands (LVS  -  Free Report) both derive the majority of their revenues from the Asian markets – specifically the island of Macau – and both have existing U.S. operations primarily in Las Vegas.  Both stock were hit by investors Monday with Wynn down 2% and LVS sinking about a percent.It’s unlikely that the Nevada casinos will actually be hurt too badly by the ruling.  Las Vegas has made great strides toward attracting visitors for more than just gambling, expanding its offerings of entertainment, dining and resort and spa services.  It’s hard to imagine that a significant percentage of visitors go specifically for sports gambling and will now choose to go elsewhere. Johnny Avello, director of the Sports Book at Wynn Las Vegas said last week that he expects the ruling to have “a negligible effect on our handle” – using a casino insider term for the total amount of money wagered.  Beyond Las VegasThough based in Las Vegas, Caesar’s Entertainment Corp (CZR  -  Free Report) operates gaming properties all over the U.S., including land-based and riverboat casinos, horse racing tracks and even dog tracks. Investors seem to like the chances that Caesar’s will be able to add sports gambling to many of its existing operations, sending the stock higher by 5%.Selling Shovels at the Gold RushThe stocks that are most likely to see increased revenues from legalized sports gambling are those that make the machines and computer systems that facilitate wagering.  An expansion in sports gambling nationwide would likely bring about a surge in demands for peripheral technology to support it.Penn National Gaming (PENN  -  Free Report) operates gaming and racing facilities nationwide with a focus on slots and machine-based betting.  Sports betting would fit nicely into their portfolio. They have recently expanded into online social gaming.Currently a Zacks rank #1 (Strong Buy), Penn has already seen their stock on the rise of late on the back of several analyst upgrades, and Monday’s news gave it an additional boost, closing up nearly 5% on the day.International Game Technology (IGT  -  Free Report) designs and manufactures gaming equipment, casino systems technology and game content.  Also a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), IGT will likely see a surge of sales growth as new and existing sports gaming operators outfit their operations for the new business. Coming off strong earnings beats in the previous two quarters, IGT had already seen several upward revisions lately and Monday’s ruling ought to improve their results even more.

1667,WYNN,"A big player in the gaming and casino industry, Las Vegas Sands Corp. (LVS  -  Free Report) started from just one property back in 1990 and now has many locations in Las Vegas; Bethlehem, PA; Macao; and Singapore.Guests not only enjoy gaming at a Las Vegas Sands resort, but a luxury hotel experience; dining and entertainment; Meetings, Incentive, Convention and Exhibition (MICE) facilities; and many other business and leisure amenities.Blowout Q1 EarningsA few weeks ago, Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) Las Vegas Sands delivered another great quarterly performance, with the top and bottom line surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fifth straight quarter.Overall, the company’s results were driven by robust performance across Macao, Singapore, and Las Vegas.Adjusted earnings of $1.04 per share and net revenues of $3.58 billion grew 57.6% and 16.7% year-over-year, respectively.

The Zacks consensus estimate trend has jumped from $3.36 per share to $3.82 per share.Analysts are feeling optimistic for fiscal 2019 as well, with six moving their estimate higher in the last 60 days.LVS has an average earnings surprise of 17.5%What’s Next for LVS?Looking ahead, the company remains focused on a convention-based Integrated Resort business model that will help generate a diversified cash flow, as well as profit from non-gaming segments. It should also bring in economic and diversification benefits to the regions in which it operates.Shares of Las Vegas Sands have gained around 7.8% since the start of the year, as well as 26.5% in the past one-year period. In comparison, the S&P 500 has lost roughly 2.6% and gained 9%, respectively.Las Vegas Sands Corp. Price and Consensus Las Vegas Sands Corp. Price and Consensus | Las Vegas Sands Corp.

1668,WYNN,"Wyndham Worldwide Corporation  reported mixed first-quarter 2018 results, wherein earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate while revenues lagged the same.Adjusted earnings of $1.33 per share beat the consensus estimate of $1.27 by 4.7%. Also, the bottom line increased 31.7% year over year including the benefit of the new income tax. Without such benefit, earnings grew 10% on the back of higher revenues in all three operating segments, hurricane-related insurance recoveries and Wyndham’s share repurchase program, partly offset by higher interest expenses.Net revenues from continuing operations were $1.19 billion and improved 3.1% from the prior-year quarter on the back of increased contribution from all its segments. However, the top line lagged the consensus estimate of $1.23 billion by 3.4%.Wyndham Worldwide Corp Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Wyndham Worldwide Corp Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Wyndham Worldwide Corp QuoteWyndham had a great deal of benefit from the U.S. corporate tax reform in its first-quarter earnings. The company’s various sales building initiatives like marketing campaigns and partnerships, digital experiences, website development, on-property amenities and travel perks to guests have favored earnings and revenue growth in the quarter. Shares of the company have rallied 5.6% in the last six months, slightly outperforming the industry’s gain of 4.7%.First-Quarter Unit PerformancesNotably, Wyndham has been functioning through its three operating segments: Hotel Group, Destination Network (formerly known as Vacation Exchange and Rentals), and Vacation Ownership.Hotel Group revenues were $302 million, up 4% from the year-ago figure, reflecting higher franchise and royalty fees, increased pass-through marketing, reservation, as well as growth in Wyndham Rewards revenues.Domestic same-store RevPAR (revenues per available room) improved 5.6% year over year. At constant currency, global system-wide same store RevPAR increased 4.7% from the prior-year quarter.Adjusted EBITDA increased 17% to $98 million primarily due to revenue increases, and a net benefit of $6 million from insurance recoveries and costs related to hurricanes.Revenues at the Destination Network segment were $246 million, reflecting an increase of 1% from the year-ago figure. While exchange revenues per member declined 1%, the average number of members increased 1%.Adjusted EBITDA increased 3% to $77 million, reflecting cost saving initiatives and hurricane-related insurance recoveries.Revenues at Vacation Ownership increased 3% year over year to $661 million. The uptick reflects an increase in gross VOI sales as well as higher consumer financing revenues, partially offset by a higher provision for loan losses.Gross VOI sales in the first quarter increased 6% from the year-ago period. Meanwhile, tour flow was up 8%, whereas volume per guest (VPG) declined 2%.Adjusted EBITDA increased 6% to $129 million on higher revenues.Operating HighlightsNet Income in the quarter totaled $81 million, lower than $127 million in the year-ago quarter.

1669,WYNN,"Macau, which is the world’s largest gambling hub, has disappointed investors with lower-than-expected revenues for the second successive month. Although gambling revenues from the Macau region increased 12.5% in June, it fell short of analyst expectations.  Shares of companies such as MGM Resorts International (MGM  -  Free Report), Melco Resorts & Entertainment Limited (MLCO  -  Free Report), Wynn Resorts, Limited (WYNN  -  Free Report) and Las Vegas Sands Corp. (LVS  -  Free Report) have declined 3%, 10.6%, 7.9% and 6.7%, respectively, following the news. All these stocks carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Gambling revenues from Macau increased 12.5% to 22.49 billion patacas ($2.78 billion) in June. The metric not only lagged analyst expectations but also declined 12% from the figure registered in May. Even though gambling revenues were up for the 23nd straight months, it still remains below the highest level achieved in 2012.A tough operating environment in Macau weighed on casino stocks from June 2014 to most part of 2016. In fact, the crackdown on corruption in China compelled Macau officials to impose restrictions on high rollers to stop billions of dollars from being siphoned off illegally from mainland China to Macau. As a result, footfall declined at the local casinos, leading to a constant decrease in gaming revenues. A slowdown in China, tighter visa policies, political unrest and a smoking ban on mass market gaming floors compounded the woes. Nevertheless, Macau's gambling revenues marked a turnaround and have been rising since the second half of 2016, with new resorts attracting high rollers and leisure gamblers.Will Dismal Macau Show Hinder Gambling Stock Rally?In the past two years, the gaming industry has rallied 50.2%, outpacing the S&P 500’s gain of 30.2%. Though revenues from the Macau region have lagged analysts’ expectation, the overall industry trend remains encouraging. In fact, this bullish trend is likely to continue through 2018 as the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA), which banned sports betting outside Nevada, has given the industry a new lease of life. Scope for casino operators will grow if betting is legalized in other states as the activity could be worth a lot of money.Despite the fact that demand in the gambling space is relatively inelastic and a fixed range of consumers will continue to seek such services irrespective of market conditions, there are reasons to believe that the industry will see consistent growth over the long haul. Notably, lenient government regulations related to online casinos have led to a rapid rise in casino operators. In fact, online gambling has been a primary growth driver for the market as a wide range of customers has gained access to such portals. Currently, the scope for the gambling industry has widened, courtesy of legalized online gambling in more than 80 countries. Europe is considered the world’s largest online gambling market.Further, according to Research and Markets, the global casino gaming market is anticipated to witness a CAGR of 10.16% in the 2017-2021 period. The stellar rally of casino stocks on the bourses has been supported by strength in domestic market, turnaround in Macau business and overall international interest in gaming space.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

1670,WYNN,"Welcome to the latest episode of the of the Full-Court Finance podcast from Zacks Investment Research. With the 2018 FIFA World Cup underway, Ben Rains dives into why it is so important that the 2026 World Cup is coming to North America. Rains then discusses all of the latest happenings in the sports betting world, as more companies get in on the action.The U.S. didn’t make the World Cup for the first time since 1986, which will likely impact Fox’s (FOXA  -  Free Report) coverage this summer. However, the company also holds the rights to the 2022 and 2026 World Cups, along with Spanish-language network Telemundo, which is owned by NBCUniversal (CMCSA  -  Free Report). The 2026 bid was a little shady and upset the likes of ESPN (DIS  -  Free Report) and others—helping FIFA live up to its somewhat poor reputation.But with the United States set to host 60 games in 2026—many of which are likely to be in primetime—in what will be the first 48-team World Cup, Fox and Telemundo look to be the clear winners. More matches, more teams, and primetime games will likely attract many more companies on top of the major players Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report), Visa V, Budweiser (BUD  -  Free Report), McDonald’s (MCD  -  Free Report), Adidas ADDYY, and Nike (NKE  -  Free Report).Moving onto sports betting, a small soccer related partnership between William Hill WIMHY and Las Vegas Lights FC, of the United Soccer League USL, will see the betting company become the soccer team’s official sports book. The deal will allow fans to make live in-game bets through William Hill’s mobile app—partnerships like this are sure to become more commonplace as legalized sports betting becomes more popular.Sports gambling is now up and running in Delaware and New Jersey. Daily fantasy giant DraftKings has already applied for a sports betting license in New Jersey, which could kick off a wave of established companies, including Wynn (WYNN  -  Free Report) and MGM (MGM  -  Free Report), rolling out sports betting locations and platforms throughout the country.Meanwhile, investors should pay attention to tech companies, like Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report), Sony (SNE  -  Free Report), and even Twitter (TWTR  -  Free Report), to see if they utilize their infrastructure to get in on the massive mobile sports betting scene. It will also be worth keeping an eye out for any sports betting acquisitions, as startups are sure to pop up. As a reminder, if you feel that we missed something, or if you have any topic suggestions, shoot us an email at podcast@zacks.com.

1671,WYNN,"The Chinese economy is growing much faster than the U.S. China reported GDP growth of 6.9% in 2017 and 6.8% in the first quarter of 2018.  Consulting firm McKinsey estimates that by 2022, 76% of China’s urban population will be “middle class.”  Compared to the U.S., Chinese savings rates are high (households save nearly 40% of their incomes, compared to almost zero in the United States) and debt levels are low. Chinese consumer consumption is growing 9% annually, and at $6.5 trillion/year, it trails only the U.S. and is well in front of Japan, Germany, the U.K. and France.With a massive and growing number of people who can now afford once unobtainable luxuries like vacations, the gaming industry in China has been surging. The Chinese island of Macau, technically a “special administrative region” – meaning it is protected by the Chinese government but runs its own autonomous government -  is China’s only site for legal casino gambling.  Though gambling has existed in Macau since the 1800’s, a 2002 order relaxed a 40-year old monopoly license, paving the way for foreign casino operators to enter the market. By 2007, gaming revenues on Macau had eclipsed those of Las Vegas.MGM Resorts international (MGM  -  Free Report), Wynn Resorts (WYNN  -  Free Report) and Las Vegas Sands (LVS  -  Free Report) have all established vast resort and gambling complexes on the island.  All three beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Q1 2018 earnings.MGM, with a large portfolio of U.S. properties, generated 18% of its first quarter profits in China, with $151M out of a total of $807M coming from the region. With earnings estimates rising, MGM Resorts is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Wynn Resorts’ first quarter earnings were $564M, with $210M of the total, or 37% coming from Macau.  Posting earnings of $2.30/share in Q1 – a surprise of 17% over the estimate of $1.96/share – Wynn is clearly a significant player in the Asian gaming landscape.  Currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), analyst expectations for 2018 are on the rise, and the consensus now stands at $8.40/share, up from $7.84/share just 30 days ago and a 54% increase over the $5.46/share they earned in 2017.The most pure China play in the gaming industry is Las Vegas Sands.  While reporting a big earnings beat last week ($1.04/share vs an expected $0.86/share), LVS earned 56% of its net profits from its 6 Macau properties.  With another 36% coming from its Singapore Marina Bay Sands resort, just over 10% of Las Vegas Sands profits come from U.S resorts, with the balance coming from the Asia-Pacific region.With 6 analyst upward revisions for 2018 in the past 7 days, LVS is a Zacks Ranks #1 (Strong Buy). Even in a strong sector, LVS stock has outperformed, with a total return of 29% over the past year versus the gaming industry average of 18%.LVS also pays a 4.2% dividend - considerably higher than MGM and WYNN at 1.5% and 1%, respectively.Amid uncertainty about the potential effect of trade wars, Gaming companies with significant Chinese exposure are a smart way to bet on China’s continued economic expansion while avoiding the political impacts on traditional industrials.

However, adjusted property EBITDA margin came in at 25.5%, a decline of 500 basis points (bps) from the year-ago quarter.

Occupancy dipped 200 bps.Operating income at the company's wholly owned domestic resorts deteriorated 5.3% to $451 million.

The company’s solid performance in the non-gaming segment is expected to continue. Notably, the company’s large-scale resorts provide distinctive lodging, entertainment and retail options that appeal to a broader customer base. Markedly, the addition of new VIP tables at the company’s Studio City property is also aiding it to deliver a broader product offering to a wider breadth of customers, which will continue to drive the top line.

This indicates that the company reinvests more efficiently than industry peers.Traditionally, gross margin for the hospitality companies is comparatively higher, as majority of the expenses come from cost of operations. However, the sector’s profits are not very high, which is evident from the net profit margin or net margin. The industry’s trailing 12-month net margin is 3.7%, while that of Melco’s is 7.3%.Favorable Industry ScenarioBeing one of the largest entertainment markets in the world, casinos seldom fail to build businesses. This is because demand for casino services is relatively inelastic, as it targets a fixed range of consumers who will continue to visit casinos irrespective of market conditions. Subsequently, the gambling market is positioned for substantial growth in the long term.Per a report by Research and Markets, the casino gaming market in the United States is expected to witness compound annual growth rate of 4.74% in the 2017-2021 period. Moreover, backed by a rise in discretionary spending and lenient government regulations, Melco, following the path of most other casino giants like Wynn Resorts (WYNN  -  Free Report), Penn National (PENN  -  Free Report) and Las Vegas Sands (LVS  -  Free Report), is about to sustain and carry forward its growth story.

1674,WYNN,"“Casino gambling is colorful and dramatic and theatrical.” — Steve Wynn.Being one of the largest entertainment markets in the world, casinos seldom fail to build businesses. This is because demand for casino services is relatively inelastic, as it targets a fixed range of consumers, who will continue to visit casinos irrespective of market conditions. Subsequently, the gambling market is positioned for substantial growth in the long term. Per a report by Research and Markets, the casino gaming market in the United States is expected to see a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.74% in the 2017-2021 period.Backed by a rise in discretionary spending and lenient government regulations, leading casino companies like Wynn Resorts (WYNN  -  Free Report), Melco Resorts & Entertainment (MLCO  -  Free Report), Penn National Gaming, Inc. (PENN  -  Free Report) and Las Vegas Sands Corp. (LVS  -  Free Report) are about to sustain and carry forward their growth story. Moreover, the recent court ruling that allows sports betting at casinos is an added advantage for these companies. Per Eilers & Krejcik Gaming 2017 reports, the legal sports betting market is likely to garner $6.03 billion in revenues annually by 2023. We believe that the scope for casino operators will intensify.In response to a rapidly evolving and dynamic market, Las Vegas Sands and Melco are capitalizing on the significant cash flow associated with the business. The companies, with a market capitalization of $62.3 billion and $15.1 billion, respectively, sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and have a Momentum Score of A. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Let’s find out which stock is a better pick as of now.Price Performance and Estimated Earnings & Revenues Arguably, earnings growth is of the utmost importance for determining a stock’s potential, as surging profit levels indicate solid prospects (and stock price gains). For 2018, Las Vegas Sands’ earnings are expected to grow 21.4%. Moreover, its 2018 year-over-year sales growth is projected at 7.2%. Melco’s 2018 earnings and sales are likely to improve 44.6% and 1.7%, respectively.Melco’s shares have rallied 25.4% in the past year, outperforming Las Vegas Sands’ gain of 20.1% and the industry’s growth of 14.9%.Valuation & Debt RatioSince the casino stocks are debt-laden, it makes sense to value them based on the EV/EBITDA (Enterprise Value/ Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization) ratio. This is because the valuation metric takes into account not just its equity, but also the level of debt on a company’s balance sheet. For capital-intensive companies, the EV/EBITDA is a better valuation metric because it is unaffected by the changing capital structures and ignores the effects of noncash expenses on a company’s value. The trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA ratio of Melco is 13.16 while that of Las Vegas Sands is 20.44x. With the industry average being 23.4x, Melco has an edge over Las Vegas Sands.Since the sector has high financial leverage, the debt-to-asset ratio comes into the picture. This measures the ability of a company to meet its long-term debt. Leisure stocks should ideally have lower debt ratios, implying higher proportion of the company’s assets over the long term. Las Vegas Sands’ debt ratio is 44.9 compared with the industry’s 53.5 and Melco’s 43x.Return on Equity & Net MarginLas Vegas Sands delivered a return on equity (ROE) of 36.4% in the trailing 12 months compared with the industry’s gain of 5.5%. Melco’s ROE is 15.1%. This indicates that Las Vegas Sands reinvests more efficiently than Melco.Traditionally, gross margin for the hospitality companies is comparatively higher as majority of the expenses come from the cost of operations. However, the sector’s profits are not very high, which is evident from the net profit margin or net margin. The industry’s trailing 12-month net margin is 3.7%, while that of Las Vegas Sands and Melco’s is 28.3% and 7.3%, respectively.Final ThoughtsWhile Melco’s projected earnings are more promising than Las Vegas Sands’, the latter’s margin and ROE posit a clear win. However, Melco surpasses Las Vegas Sands in terms of valuation, debt and share price appreciation. Please take a look at the following table to compare the two gaming giants on your own.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

1675,WYNN,"Shares of Wynn Resorts, Limited (WYNN  -  Free Report) have witnessed a sharp decline of more than 8% in the last two trading sessions. The downside can be primarily attributed to disappointing gambling revenues from the Macau region in May. Other stocks such as Melco Resorts & Entertainment Ltd. (MLCO  -  Free Report) and Las Vegas Sands Corp. (LVS  -  Free Report), which belong to the same industry and has highest exposure to Macau region, have also declined following the news.Gambling revenues from Macau increased 12.1% to 25.5 billion patacas ($3.16 billion) in May. The metric not only lagged analyst expectations but also decreased 0.9% from the figure registered in April. Although gambling revenues were up for the 22nd straight months, it still remains below the highest level achieved in 2012.A tough operating environment in Macau weighed on casino stocks from June 2014 to most part of 2016. In fact, the crackdown on corruption in China compelled Macau officials to impose restrictions on high rollers to stop billions of dollars from being siphoned off illegally from mainland China to Macau.As a result, footfall declined at the local casinos, leading to a constant decrease in gaming revenues. A slowdown in China, tighter visa policies, political unrest and a smoking ban on mass market gaming floors compounded the woes. Nevertheless, Macau's gambling revenues marked a turnaround and have been rising since the second half of 2016, with new resorts attracting high rollers and leisure gamblers.What’s Lies Ahead for Wynn Resorts?Wynn Resorts generates a solid share of its revenues from Macau resorts. Apart from the gaming business in Macau, the company has been increasingly focusing on boosting non-gaming revenues. Given the decent visitation pattern in Macau, infrastructure development and government’s efforts to boost tourism in Macau, non-gaming sources are expected to drive revenues moving ahead.Moreover, the company’s full-scale integrated resort in Cotai, Macau, is poised to witness increased visits from tourists and leisure gamblers over the long term. This, in turn, should fortify Wynn Resorts’ position in the Cotai strip.Notably, such projects are expected to draw business and leisure travelers, and provide a solid platform for growth. In fact, building resorts in Asia should help the company capitalize on strong consumer spending trend in the region. Meanwhile, in Wynn Palace, the company is working on two new restaurant concepts that are expected to add significantly to the non-gaming business.Also, the government of China is considering measures to support Macau’s economy and introduce favorable policies, which are expected to improve visitation pattern and increase tourism and traffic in the region. These stratergic initiatives include approval of Macau’s maritime expansion plans that is expected to boost shipping and tourism. Also, the government has allowed mainland Chinese cities to offer multi-entry permits.In a year’s time, Wynn Resorts’ shares have gained 33.7%, outpacing the industry’s rally of 17.1%.Zacks Rank & a Key PickWynn Resorts has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

In fact, the crackdown on corruption in China compelled Macau officials to impose restrictions on high rollers to stop billions of dollars from being siphoned off illegally from mainland China to Macau.As a result, footfall declined at the local casinos, leading to a constant decrease in gaming revenues. A slowdown in China, tighter visa policies, political unrest and a smoking ban on mass market gaming floors compounded the woes. Nevertheless, Macau's gambling revenues marked a turnaround and have been rising since the second half of 2016, with new resorts attracting high rollers and leisure gamblers.MGM Resorts to Buy Empire City CasinoMGM Resorts and MGM Growth Properties LLC have reached an agreement to buy Empire City Casino's race track and casino. If Empire City gets a license for live table games on or before Dec 31, 2022 and MGM Resorts accepts it by Dec 31, 2024, then the latter will pay an additional amount of $50 million to the former. Valued at $850 million, the deal is expected to close in first-quarter 2019.On completion of the deal, MGP will acquire the developed real property related to Empire City from MGM Resorts and will lease it to a subsidiary of the same. MGM Resorts subsidiary will control the property. The deal will help the company solidify its position on the East Coast, where MGM Resorts has been constantly increasing its presence over the past two years. MGM Resorts said that “With Empire City's approximately 40 percent share of gross gaming revenues in the market, we believe there are significant opportunities for MGM Resorts to further drive growth.” The company expects the deal to be value assertive within the first year of closing. In 2017, Empire City recorded net revenues of nearly $230 million and $70 million in adjusted EBITDA.We believe this latest buyout will be a major growth driver for the company. This is because Empire City Casino not only has 5,200 slots and electronic table games but also offers live and simulcast horse racing, besides numerous dining outlets.MGM Resorts has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Boyd Gaming Closes Lattner Entertainment Group BuyoutBoyd Gaming has completed the previously announced acquisition of Lattner Entertainment Group.

1681,WYNN,"Extended Stay America, Inc. (STAY  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 26, after market close.While the company’s expense containment and cost-saving measures are expected to have favored first-quarter earnings, revenues in the quarter might have been affected by a shift in Easter date. Also, limited international presence continues to be a headwind for the company’s revenues.Notably, shares of Extended Stay have gained 17% in the past year, underperforming the industry’s growth of 30.9% in the same time period.Let’s discuss the factors that are likely to influence the company’s first-quarter results.Efficient Cost Management to Favor EarningsExtended Stay’s operating model posits a low-cost capital structure that has low fixed and variable costs. Even though an ongoing increase in wages can substantially put pressure on the company’s expenses, its cost-saving measures are expected to have driven margins in the quarter.In 2017, Extended Stay’s operating profit increased 0.7% year over year and the trend is likely to continue in the first quarter as well. Subsequently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter earnings is pegged at 17 cents, suggesting 13.3% increase from the year-ago quarter.Tricky Top-Line ScenarioExtended Stay looks to drive its revenue per available room (ReVPAR) by providing suitable services to value-conscious business travelers. In 2017, its ReVPAR increased 1.7% from the prior-year quarter on 1.1% growth in Average Daily Rate (ADR) and 40 basis points (bps) expansion in occupancy. Management believes that this upside trend will continue in the first quarter of 2018 by 1-3%.However, the company predicts 50-75 bps negative impact on ReVPAR due to a shift in Easter date. Moreover, the company’s lack of exposure in emerging markets might limit its revenue growth potential.The consensus estimate for revenues in the first quarter is pegged at $289.78 million, reflecting a decline of 0.4% from the prior-year quarter.Our Quantitative Model Predicts a BeatExtended Stay has the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.Zacks ESP: The company has an Earnings ESP of +3.50%.

1682,WYNN,"MGM Resorts International (MGM  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 26, before market opens. In the previous quarter, the company’s earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 100%.What to Expect?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at 31 cents, which is lower than 38 cents in the year-ago quarter. However, the consensus mark has witnessed an upward revision of 1 cent over the past 30 days. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of nearly $2,799 million, up 3.3% from the prior-year quarter.Let’s take a look at how the company’s top and bottom lines will shape up in the to-be-reported quarter.Factors at PlayMGM Resorts’ top line in the first quarter is expected to be driven by strong business model, extensive non-gaming revenue opportunities, high quality assets and attractive property locations. Further, maximization of digital technology is likely to boost the company’s performance. In fact, over the past few years, MGM Resorts has taken various initiatives to align every recognized brand into one global entertainment brand. This, in turn, resulted in a disciplined business model with a unified view of strategy.Moreover, MGM Resorts derives a solid share of its revenues from Macau — the largest gaming destination in the world — which is likely to continue in the soon-to-be reported quarter. Per the Macau Gaming Inspection and Coordination Bureau, gross gaming revenues increased in all the three months of the first quarter, thus continuing with the revival in Macau. This might boost first-quarter revenues at MGM China.However, MGM Resorts, which owns and operates several properties in Las Vegas, is likely to witness revenues decline in the region. The company had earlier stated that revenues from Las Vegas are likely to decline in the range of 3-5%. Moreover, revenue per available room growth (ReVPAR) from the region is expected to decrease by 4-6%.On the earnings front, the company is likely to witness a sharp decline in the first quarter. Also, MGM Resorts has been grappling with high labor costs and expenses associated with technological initiatives. These costs are likely to put pressure on the company’s margins in the to-be-reported quarter and hurt the bottom line. Higher costs associated with Monte Carlo construction might weigh on the company’s margins as well.Furthermore, heavy reliance on debt financing remains a concern. The company’s cash and cash equivalents as of Dec 31, 2017 were nearly $1.4 billion compared with a much higher long-term debt of $12.8 billion. Therefore, any severe slowdown in future macroeconomic and credit market conditions are likely to affect the company’s ability to pay or refinance its debt.MGM Resorts International Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise MGM Resorts International Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | MGM Resorts International QuoteWhat Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Our proven model does not show that MGM Resorts is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter.

The company's shares have rallied 41.9%, outperforming the industry’s gain of 30.9%.Let’s find out how Hilton’s first-quarter results will shape up.Top Line to Grow on Expansion Strategies & Loyalty ProgramThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues in the first quarter is pegged at $2.26 billion, reflecting 4.4% year-over-year growth. In 2017, the company witnessed revenue growth of 23.8% from 2016 and the upside trend is likely to continue in the first quarter as well. Moreover, for the to-be-reported quarter, management expects system-wide RevPAR to witness a year-over-year increase of 1-3% on a comparable and currency-neutral basis.The consensus estimate for the same is pegged at $102 million. Also, for the to-be-reported quarter, the company expects its management and franchise fee revenues to increase in the band of 8-10% year over year.This prospective growth is attributable to the company’s relentless expansion strategies and a strong loyalty program. In a bid to maintain its position as the fastest-growing global hospitality company, Hilton is continuing to drive unit growth. In 2017, Hilton witnessed net unit growth of 18,400 rooms. Further, the company expanded its footprint across new countries totaling 105 countries and territories. For 2018, the company projects an approximate 6.5% net unit growth. It also continues to have more rooms under construction in Europe, the Middle East and Asia Pacific than any other hotel chain.Meanwhile, Hilton has created one of the largest loyalty programs, Hilton Honors. With about 71 million members, this network has created an extremely valuable asset for the company. In 2017, the company added more than 11 million members to the program. The company continues to make multiple enhancements to its loyalty program in order to make it the most customer-centric program, driving incremental value for guests and the overall system, thereby driving revenues.Earnings Likely to See GrowthHilton saw adjusted EBITDA to grow 11% to $1,965 million in 2017, compared with $1,763 million in 2016. The positive trend is likely to continue in the first quarter as well since management posted adjusted EBITDA in the $410-$430 million band.The company’s margins are benefited by strong ReVPAR growth and efficient cost control. Also, a capital-light business model allows the company to receive a greater return on lesser invested capital. This is additionally a riveting factor for Hilton’s profits to grow.Subsequently, the consensus estimate pegs earnings in the first quarter at 50 cents, suggesting 31.6% year-over-year growth. This exceeds the company’s expected earnings in the range of 43-47 cents per share for the to-be-reported quarter.Our Quantitative Model Predicts a BeatHilton has the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.Zacks ESP: The company has an Earnings ESP of +3.09%.

1685,WYNN,"Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. (RCL  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 financial numbers on Apr 26, before the opening bell.Last quarter, the company pulled off a positive earnings surprise of 11.7%. In fact, Royal Caribbean’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 5.9%.What to Expect ?The question lingering in investors’ minds now is whether Royal Caribbean will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first quarter is pegged at 96 cents, which is lower than 99 cents in the year-ago quarter. Of late, the company’s earnings estimates have been stable. In the preceding quarter, the company’s witnessed earnings growth of 8.9% on a year-over-year basis. Meanwhile, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of nearly $2,046 million, up 1.9% from the prior-year quarter.Let’s delve deeper to find out how this global cruise vacation company’s top and bottom lines will shape up in the to-be-reported quarter.Factors at PlayRoyal Caribbean’s top line in the first quarter is expected to be driven by robust book position and onboard revenues. Notably, majority of Asia-Pacific itineraries have been delivering impressive performance for a while now. In fact, each of the company’s China, Australia and Southeast Asia itineraries is booked higher than last year in load factor. Furthermore, robust demand for North America and Europe itineraries are likely to drive the company’s performance in the quarter. Royal Caribbean is benefiting from its global sourcing model, revenue management strategies and the price integrity program as well.However, rise in costs are likely to impact the company’s earnings. Royal Caribbean expects net cruise costs, excluding fuel, to increase in the range of 1.5-2% for 2018. This improvement in the cost metric is likely driven by planned sales and marketing investments, timing of third-quarter costs and lower-than-expected APCDs due to hurricanes. Earlier, the company had stated that it envisions first-quarter adjusted earnings per share at roughly 95 cents. Constant-currency net yields are projected to increase in the band of 3-3.5%. NCC, excluding fuel, is expected to be up about 10% at constant currency.Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter revenues from Macau operations is pegged at $634 million, reflecting an increase of 8% from the year-ago quarter.Although revenues from the Las Vegas operations in the first quarter are expected to decline 3.4% year over year, an improving tourism industry and overall uplift in consumer discretionary spending are expected to aid the top line.Nonetheless, the company’s overall top line is expected to have improved in the quarter.

1689,WYNN,"Las Vegas Sands Corp. (LVS  -  Free Report) is known for continual investment in new capital projects in Macao and Las Vegas. Also, solid expansion strategies of the company are encouraging. However, stiff competition and greater dependence on debt financing remain concerns.The company’s scale and diversity of gaming and non-gaming services, across Macao and Singapore operations primarily drove better-than-expected results in fourth-quarter 2017.Notably, shares of Las Vegas Sands have gained 25.8% in the past year, outperforming its industry’s growth of 21.9%. An upward estimate revision of 0.6% for earnings in the current year, over the last 60 days, also reflects analysts’ optimism.Given the ongoing recovery of gaming revenues in Macao and continued improvement in the Las Vegas business, the stock is expected to perform well in the quarters ahead.Continued Expansion & Revenue-Diversification Efforts Bode WellLow unemployment levels, a slight uptick in consumer discretionary spending and the growth of tourism industry have been favorable for Las Vegas Sands. In order to rake in profits, the company is continuously expanding through planned investments in new capital projects.Moreover, Las Vegas Sands is consistently trying to diversify its revenue sources. The company remains focused on a convention-based Integrated Resort business model that helps in generating the most diversified set of cash flows and profit from non-gaming segments. Also, in collaboration with Madison Square Garden, Live Nation Entertainment (LYV  -  Free Report) and Oak View Group, Las Vegas Sands plans to create a large-scale music and entertainment venue in Las Vegas, for concerts and events.We believe that this continued expansion and focus on non-gaming segment will continue to attract greater number of customers, and help the company generate more sales. Also, due to the diversification in revenue stream, EBITDA margins have been improving consistently as non-gaming segments carry higher margins. On a consolidated basis, adjusted property EBITDA was up 19.7% year over year to $1.34 billion in the fourth quarter on robust operating momentum in Macao operations.Stiff Competition & Debt Burden are HeadwindsGrowth in the tourism industry and increased demand have made Las Vegas and Macao markets highly competitive. Excess supply in these markets might reduce Las Vegas Sands’ market share and thereby hurt its revenues. The company is constantly facing peer pressure from several Chinese casino operators, and other U.S.-based companies including Wynn Resorts (WYNN  -  Free Report) and MGM Resorts International (MGM  -  Free Report).Meanwhile, Las Vegas Sands’ heavy reliance on debt financing remains a concern. As of Dec 31, 2017, unrestricted cash balance was $2.4 billion, up from $2 billion as of Sep 30, 2017. However, total debt outstanding, including the current portion and net of deferred financing costs, along with original issue discount, was as high as $9.64 billion and increased $0.02 billion sequentially in the fourth quarter of 2017.Owing to higher debt burden, the company may fail to finance its upcoming projects. Moreover, any downturn in the macroeconomic and credit market conditions would make it difficult for the company to pay or refinance its debt, going ahead.Zacks RankLas Vegas Sands carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1690,WYNN,"Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. (RCL  -  Free Report) is investing heavily in capacity expansion and fleet modernization with a view to enhance guest experience, catering to changing demand for cruise vacations across the world.The company posted strong fourth-quarter 2017 results, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings by 11.7% and the same for revenues, by 1%. While the bottom line grew 8.9% year over year, the top line rose 4.9%.Royal Caribbean has had an impressive run on the bourse over a year’s time. Shares have rallied 21.9%, significantly outperforming the industry’s gain of 14.7%. Double-Double AchievedRoyal Caribbean launched a profitability initiative called Double-Double program in 2014. The project aimed at doubling the company’s 2014 earnings per share by 2017, thus bringing its return on invested capital (ROIC) to double-digit percentages and bettering revenue yields plus adopting cost-control measures as well as moderating capacity growth. Management notes that the company has achieved its preset targets in 2017 and reported EPS of $7.53 with the ROIC having risen to above 10%. On a further positive note, the company expects 2018 to be another great year of double-digit EPS growth.Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. Net Income (TTM) Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. Net Income (TTM) | Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. Quote 20/20 On the WayRoyal Caribbean also has a multi-year program named 20/20 Vision in place, leveraging the culture and discipline instilled by Double-Double while also gearing up for a broader set of goals. The program serves as a guiding light to the organization and builds on its proven formula for success of delivering modest yield and capacity growth plus a strong cost control combined with efforts to enhance customer advocacy and employee engagement.Under this program, the company strives to improve its already excellent guest satisfaction and employee engagement while at the same time, delivering its environmental commitments. These operational drivers are expected to further improve the company’s double-digit return profile and boost double-digit earnings per share by the end of 2020.Royal Caribbean’s recent announcement of multibillion-dollar investments in a couple of new programs namely Perfect Day Island Collection and Royal Amplified, seem integral to the 20/20 vision.Perfect Day Island Collection focuses on the company’s private island destinations internationally. The first edition of collection will feature Royal Caribbean’s private island in the Bahamas, CocoCay, which the company is likely to upgrade by splurging $200 million. The company will announce additional destinations of this collection in Australia, Asia and the Caribbean at a later date.Under the Royal Amplified, the company aims to pump $900 million into modernization of 10 ships over a span of four years.Higher Costs Remain a HurdleSuch investments will help Royal Caribbean shift its deployment toward Asia, Australia and certain areas of Europe to curtail capacity in regions with geopolitical risks.

1691,WYNN,"Shares of Wynn Resorts (WYNN  -  Free Report) fell nearly 3% on Wednesday as the embattled casino and resort power continues to see its stock price fluctuate almost daily.Latest NewsFormer Wynn CEO Steve Wynn, who resigned recently amid sexual assault and harassment allegations, now “intends to sell all or a portion” of his stock in the company. Mr. Wynn is currently the company’s largest shareholder, holding roughly 11.8% of outstanding shares.Mr. Wynn could potentially sell up to 12.1 million shares of Wynn stock, which would be valued at roughly $2.2 billion, based on Wednesday’s price. However, the company noted in Wednesday’s SEC filing that “no assurance” can be made on whether Mr. Wynn will elect to sell his stock or how he will choose to do it.This news comes after two months of stories and legal battles surrounding Mr. Wynn’s sexual misconduct allegations. Mr. Wynn has denied these allegations, despite reaching a $7.5 million settlement with at least one accuser.It seems that Wynn shareholders are unclear how to feel about this potential move, which could temporarily devalue their stock if over 12 million shares flood the market. On the other hand, if Mr. Wynn does indeed sell some or all of his stock, the company could be headed for a potential takeover, which some investors might welcome amid these uncertain times.However, in spite of the allegations against the former CEO and the possibility that he might sell a large chunk of the company, Wynn is expected to perform rather well in 2018.Looking Ahead Wynn’s Q1 revenues are projected to surge over 14% to reach $1.68 billion, while the casino giant’s full-year sales are expected to climb by 10.2% to hit $6.95 billion. The company is also expected to see its earnings soar.Wynn is projected to see its quarterly earnings skyrocket 54%, while its fiscal 2018 EPS figure is expected to jump by 43.2% to reach 7.82 per share. These bottom-line expansion projections might ease some worries while Wynn faces public scrutiny.Analysts have also turned more positive recently regarding Wynn’s 2018 financial outlook. Wynn has earned multiple earnings estimate revisions for its current quarter, the following quarter, the current full year, and the following full year, with 100% agreement to the upside—all within the last 60 days.Bottom Line Wynn stock might be one investors consider buying up, as Mr. Wynn’s alleged misconduct doesn’t look like it will hurt the company’s performance in the near term. Wynn is also currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and sports a “B” grade for Growth in our Style Scores system.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers.

1692,WYNN,"Tuesday, April 24, 2018Ahead of today’s opening bell, we see results from Case-Shiller’s February housing prices index, with results in-line with expectations of 6.3% year-over-year growth. The 20-city index — from Atlanta to Washington D.C. — went up 0.8% (seasonally adjusted) to 6.8% year over year. Seattle was the index’s top performer on both a month-to-month and year-over-year basis, +1.7% and +12.7%, respectively.No cities experienced monthly or yearly price declines. The worst-performing of the 20 cities represented in the index was Chicago: +0.1% month over month and +2.6% year over year. Yes, the Case-Shiller index is a lagging indicator, but it is considered among the most solid of economic metrics on the calendar.We are now also in the thick of Q1 earnings season. After today’s close we’ll also hear from Texas Instruments (TXN  -  Free Report), Wynn Resorts (WYNN  -  Free Report), Capital One (COF  -  Free Report) and others. But here’s a quick run-down of some top names this morning:Caterpillar (CAT  -  Free Report) put up another big positive surprise for its Q1 2018, with earnings of $2.82 per share topping the $2.11 expected and +34% year over year. Revenues of $12.9 billion in the quarter outpaced the $11.6 billion in the Zacks consensus estimate. Guidance also cranked up for the full-year, from a range of $8.25-9.25 previously to $10.25-11.25 this morning.Shares have reacted favorably thus far in today’s pre-market, with CAT shares up 3.4% currently. Of course, any negative news regarding trade with China would likely put a damper on this company’s outlook, but for now Caterpillar appears to be firing on all cylinders. For more on CAT’s earnings, click here.Lockheed Martin (LMT  -  Free Report) also posted a solid earnings beat, reporting $4.02 per share as opposed to the $3.35 per share, for a positive surprise of 20%.

1693,WYNN,"Shares of Wynn Resorts (WYNN  -  Free Report) experienced marginal gains on Monday, just one day before the company is scheduled to report its first quarter financial results. This climb is part of a larger 9% surge over the last four weeks, which might suggest that investors are expecting big things from the resort and casino giant in Q1.Wynn looks like it could be set for even more changes on top after Elaine Wynn recently demanded that the company make changes to the board. She asked that one of Wynn’s directors overseeing the internal investigation into sexual misconduct allegations against Steve Wynn be removed, noting he is too closely allied to Mr. Wynn.This move could go a long way in further distancing Wynn from its embattled former CEO. But beyond a positive public relations move, investors will want to understand what to expect from Wynn’s first quarter to see if the stock might be worth buying before the company reports its Q1 results on Tuesday afternoon.Latest Outlook & ValuationOur current Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for Wynn’s revenues to climb by 15.5% to $1.70 billion. Investors might be even more pleased to note that the company’s earnings are projected to reach $1.96 per share, which would mark a 58% expansion from the year-ago period.Of course, top and bottom line growth estimates are just two of the many things investors will be concerned with when Wynn reports its first quarter financial results. We can also turn to our exclusive non-financial metrics consensus estimate file to help prepare.The Zacks Consensus NFM file contains detailed estimate data for business segment metrics and non-financial metrics reported by companies. The data is acquired from digest and contributing broker models and includes the independent research of expert stock market analysts.According to these consensus estimates, Wynn is on track to report Macau revenues of $638 million in Q1. This would mark a roughly 34% climb from the year-ago period, in a unit that is quickly becoming one of the resort giant’s most important businesses. Last quarter, Wynn reported $618.6 million in Macau revenue, which marked a 24.1% jump.Heading into Monday, Wynn was trading with a Forward P/E of 23.2, which marked a slight premium to the “Gaming” industry’s average of 21.3. With that said, the company is currently offering investors strong comparative value against its median Forward P/E of 25.1. Wynn also sits well below the 29.3x forward earnings it was trading at near the end of January.  Earnings ESP WhispersInvestors will also want to understand what chance Wynn has to surprise with better-than-expected earnings results. For this, we turn to our Earnings ESP figure.Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst estimates. This is done because, generally speaking, when an analyst posts an estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.A positive Earnings ESP paired with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better ranking helps us feel confident about the potential for an earnings beat. In fact, our 10-year backtest has revealed that this methodology has accurately produced a positive surprise 70% of the time.Wynn is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and holds an Earnings ESP of 5.45%. The company’s Most Accurate Estimate—the representation of the most recent analyst sentiment—calls for earnings of $2.07 per share, which comes in 11 cents above our current consensus estimate. Therefore, Wynn is a stock that could be ready to top Q1 earnings estimates.Surprise HistoryWynn’s earnings surprise history and the effect that these surprises have had on its share prices are two other important factors to consider ahead of the casino power’s first quarter earnings report.Wynn Resorts, Limited Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Wynn Resorts, Limited Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Wynn Resorts, Limited QuoteWe can see that Wynn has posted strong earnings results over the last year, posting an average earnings surprise of 22.43% during this period. However, these beats haven’t always led to positive momentum immediately following Wynn’s quarterly earnings release.We judge the price effect of these earnings beats by comparing the closing price of the stock two days before the report and two days after the report. Wynn stock has turned negative in two of these windows over the last four quarters.Wynn is scheduled to report its first quarter financial results after market close on Tuesday, April 24. Investors will want to pay close attention to Wynn’s Q1 performance as other industry giants, including Las Vegas Sands (LVS  -  Free Report) and MGM Resorts (MGM  -  Free Report), report their quarterly financial results later this week.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

1696,WYNN,"Las Vegas Sands Corp. (LVS  -  Free Report) is slated to release first-quarter 2018 financial numbers on Apr 25, after market close.The company’s scale and diversity owing to its gaming and non-gaming services, are expected to have benefited revenues and earnings in the to-be-reported quarter. While relentless expansion efforts are likely to reflect in the first-quarter revenue numbers, the non-gaming segment’s higher margins are expected to boost earnings of the company.Also, the company’s shares have rallied 27.8% in the past year, outperforming the industry’s gain of 25.4%.Let’s see in detail how the company’s top and bottom line will look like in the first-quarter results.Encouraging Top-Line PictureLas Vegas Sands’ revenues are likely to increase year over year on a solid business model, extensive non-gaming revenue opportunities, high-quality assets and attractive property locations. Additionally, a few planned entertainment offerings are expected to prove profitable in the first quarter.Consequently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter revenues is pegged at $3.34 billion, reflecting 7.5% year-over-year growth. Also, net revenues in 2017 increased 12.5% from a year ago, indicating an upward trend in overall revenues.Coming to the company’s Macao business, the consensus estimate for first-quarter revenues in the Venetian Macao reflects 11.1% year-over-year growth. Sands Cotai Central revenues are expected to grow 9.2% in the first quarter from a year ago. Further, The Plaza Macao and Four Seasons Hotel Macao revenues are expected to witness 21.7% year-over-year growth in the first quarter of 2018.Las Vegas Sands aims to benefit from structural growth in Macao. In fact, the fourth quarter of 2017 marked strong results in Macao with robust growth metrics across the gaming and non-gaming segments. This trend is expected to reflect in the first-quarter results as well.However, for Las Vegas operations, the consensus estimate for first-quarter revenues is pegged at $406 million, reflecting a decline of 6.5% year-over-year. Nevertheless, the company is focusing on renovation and promotion of its Las Vegas properties in order to drive segmental performance. The rise in employment rate and tourism in the region has been boosting demand at the company’s properties. Further, diversification of the company’s resort portfolio and non-gaming options are expected to contribute significantly to revenues.Improvement in EBITDA Margins to Drive EarningsWhile some companies in the leisure industry are grappling with margin pressure, Las Vegas Sands’ performance has been considerably better. EBITDA margins have been improving consistently buoyed by focus on mass and non-gaming segments that carry higher margins.

1697,WYNN,"Spring is officially in the air. And it isn’t only about cleaning your closet, but also cleaning up your portfolio. So, it’s time to buy such stocks that have the potential to bloom. Financial and energy-oriented stocks have historically performed better than the general market this warmer season.Spring breaks, in the meantime, are great for family vacations and trips. Thus, companies that do business in sectors catering to warm weather activities like travel and leisure also tend to do well.How Will the Stock Market Fare This Spring?Facebook’s worst drop in nearly four years over data breach has made a lot of noise lately. This in turned has sparked a selloff in technology shares, which by the way has been the best performing sector so far this year.Recent political worry that led to a number of high-profile departures from the Trump administration and a potential global trade war is also keeping a lid on the broader market upside. Trade friction escalated after the White House planned to levy hefty tariffs on Chinese imports, and foreign steel and aluminum.The economic backdrop, however, paints a rosy picture. Steady rise in wages, record low jobless rate and upbeat consumer confidence will certainly help the stock market return to its winning ways this spring season. Trump’s business-friendly policies including tax cuts and repealing regulations will also add to stock market gains. Needless to say, we are heading into April which has been historically good for stocks.Financial & Energy Shares OutperformWhile the spring season bodes well for the broader market, financial and energy sectors have traditionally performed even better. As per CNBC.com, both these sectors have given a staggering return of more than 20% over the past 10 warmer seasons, while the S&P 500 managed an average gain of only 5%.This time around it won’t be different either. Financials are poised to gain as the Fed is widely expected to raise rates by a quarter percentage point this month. As per the CME Group, investors see a 94.4% probability that the central bank will hike rates as near-term inflation expectations climb in March to its highest level in three years.Higher interest rates will boost bank profits as they increase the spread between what banks earn by funding longer-term assets, such as loans, with shorter-term liabilities. A rise in rates will also enable insurance firms to invest in higher-yielding government securities, thereby leading to greater returns, while brokerage firms and asset managers benefit immensely from rising-rate environments since an increase in rates generally concurs with periods of economic strength and investor enthusiasm.Coming to the energy sector, it is true that rapid increase in oil supply is leading to the current mismatch between supply and demand. But energy still remains a big growth contributor in Q1, with total earnings for the sector expected to be up 65.7% from the year-earlier period on 15.4% higher revenues (read more: Q1 Earnings Season to Show Growth Acceleration).Travel & Leisure Activities Increase in Warm WeatherWith the advent of spring, many people spend on outdoor activities and travel is very much on their minds. After all, very few can travel in the harsh winter months. Thus, stocks related to the travel and leisure sector will do well.Needless to say that consumer sentiment touched a 14-year high this month, as households felt more optimistic about the economy. An uptick in consumer sentiment generally leads to a rise in outlays, eventually benefiting companies related to travel and leisure activities.5 Stocks to Buy This SpringIf you are looking for some stocks to buy the spring, look no further. Here are five to consider from the aforesaid sectors. These stocks also flaunt a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).BancFirst Corporation (BANF  -  Free Report) operates as the bank holding company for BancFirst that provides a range of commercial banking services to retail customers, and small to medium-sized businesses.

1699,WYNN,"Stocks opened slightly higher on Wednesday as investors begin to reap some rewards from the start of first quarter earnings season. Despite this recent market momentum, uncertainty is still present, which means investors need to continue to utilize Q1 earnings season in order to look for stocks set to top earnings estimates.First quarter earnings season has already helped some stocks kick back into high gear, including streaming giant Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report). But just because the overall market has performed relatively well over the last week, doesn’t mean that earnings season will be a net positive for every stock. In fact, a slow quarter or a big earnings miss could lead to even further declines.Luckily, Zacks Premium customers can utilize the Earnings ESP Screener in order to search for stocks that are expected to surprise.This is done because, generally speaking, when an analyst posts an estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.A positive Earnings ESP paired with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better ranking helps us feel confident about the potential for an earnings beat. In fact, our 10-year backtest has revealed that this methodology has accurately produced a positive surprise 70% of the time.Let’s take a look at three stocks that look ready to beat first quarter earnings estimates.1.     Capital One (COF  -  Free Report)Shares of Capital One are down just 1.2% over the last month, which shows that it has been a bit more resistant to the nearly market-wide downturn than many other stocks. The credit card company is projected to see its quarterly revenues climb by 6.4% to hit $6.96 billion, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimates. Meanwhile, Capital One’s Q1 earnings are expected to surge by 32% to $2.31 per share. Better still, Capital One is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and sports an Earnings ESP of 0.79%. The company’s Most Accurate Estimate—the representation of the most recent analyst sentiment—calls for earnings of $2.33 per share, which comes in 2 cents above our current consensus estimate. This means that Capital One is a stock that could top earnings estimates when it reports its first quarter financial results after market close on Tuesday, April 24.2.       Wynn Resorts (WYNN  -  Free Report)This embattled casino giant looks like it could be headed for more big changes on top after Elaine Wynn recently demanded that Wynn Resorts move quickly to restructure its board. Wynn Resorts has also seen its stock price pop 3.51% over the last month as investors react more to the business than to its former CEO’s scandal. Looking ahead to the first quarter, Wynn Resorts is expected to see its revenues climb by 14% to $1.68 billion.Investors might be even more pleased to note that the company’s earnings are projected to reach $1.92 per share, which would mark a 54.8% expansion from the year-ago period. Wynn Resorts has also experienced positive earnings estimate revision activity recently. Lastly, WYNN is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and holds an Earnings ESP of 0.35%, with its Most Accurate Estimate coming in 1 cent above our current consensus estimate. Therefore, WYNN is a stock that could be ready to top Q1 earnings estimates. The casino company is also expected to report its Q1 financial results on Tuesday, April 24.3.       JetBlue Airways (JBLU  -  Free Report)Shares of JetBlue popped on Wednesday morning as the company inches closer to the release of its first quarter earnings report on April 24. Prior to this surge, JBLU stock had been down more than 11% over the last month. But JetBlue has earned five upward earnings estimate revisions within the last seven days, and the company’s revenues are expected to climb by nearly 10% to reach $1.76 billion.Investors might be less pleased to note that JetBlue’s Q1 earnings are expected slip 12% from the year-ago period to hit $0.22 per share. With that said, the company is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and boasts an Earnings ESP of 1.02%. This means that JetBlue looks poised to top Q1 earnings estimates. Can Hackers Put Money INTO Your Portfolio?Earlier this year, credit bureau Equifax announced a massive data breach affecting 2 out of every 3 Americans.

1701,WYNN,"Reinforcing his protectionist agenda, President Donald Trump sought to levy new tariffs worth up to $60 billion on China, according to Reuters. Mainly Chinese apparel, technology and telecom goods are being subjected to this tariff. This month, Trump has imposed a 25% tariff on steel imports and a 10% on aluminum imports. These tariffs are likely to push up costs and weigh on international sales of U.S. companies (read: 5 ETFs to Buy in March & Forget Trade War, Inflation Fears).The Trump administration is also reportedly mulling over “imposing investment restrictions on Chinese companies over and above the heightened national security restrictions.”Needless to say, trade war fears are rife at the moment. Already, the European Union (EU) has threatened the United States of a tit-for-tat tariff on a range of consumer, agricultural and steel products. Now China could be the next in line to levy a retaliatory tariff (read: Trade War Talks Heat Up: ETFs & Stocks in Focus).Naturally, companies that have extensive trade relations with China might face the brunt of a trade war. Technology chip suppliers selling products to manufacturers in China will also be dealt a heavy blow. In fact, Goldman Sachs compiled some companies with considerable revenue exposure to China.Let’s take a look at those companies and the related ETFs.  Likely Stock and ETF Losers Industrial Boeing China is a key market for Boeing Co (BA  -  Free Report) where it serves as the largest exporter of America. Last September, the company said that it expects China to spend about $1.1 trillion over the next 20 years, purchasing more than 7,200 airplanes. The Chinese government has indicated that it might order Airbus in place of Boeing jets if the United States spoils its trade relation with China. Shares of Boeing fell 2.5% on Mar 14.Industrial ETFs like iShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense ETF ITA, SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (DIA  -  Free Report) and Industrial Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLI  -  Free Report) are highly invested in Boeing and could thus be hit hard.Technology Skyworks Solutions Inc (SWKS  -  Free Report)The company, which makes highly innovative analog semiconductors, has 85% revenue exposure to China, per Goldman, quoted on CNBC. The stock has moderate focus on ETFs like Global X Internet of Things Thematic ETF SNSR (around 6% weight) and iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF (SOXX  -  Free Report) (around 3.8% weight).Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report)The leader in 3G, 4G and next-generation wireless technologies has 69$ revenue exposure to China and has exposure in ETFs like SOXX (about 6%).NVIDIA Corp NVDAThis semiconductor company is 56% related to China and is heavy on ETFs like Global X Robotics & Artificial Intelligence Thematic ETF BOTZ (about 9% focus) and SOXX (about 8% focus).Other tech and semiconductor companies include Intel Corporation INTC, Micron Technology Inc. (MU), Applied Materials Inc. AMAT, Lam Research LRCX, Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), Amphenol Corporation (APH  -  Free Report), which have sales exposure of 22% to 55%to China.Consumer Discretionary Wynn Resorts Ltd (WYNN  -  Free Report)This owner and operator of casino resorts has 64% exposure to China. The stock has around 5% focus on each of PowerShares Dynamic Leisure and Entertainment PEJ and VanEck Vectors Gaming ETF BJK.Likely Stock & ETF Winners Small-Cap Retail & Technology Since Trump’s tariff plan will take consumer goods into consideration, small-cap apparel, footwear and toys companies are likely to benefit, which do not have much foreign exposure. PowerShares S&P SmallCap Consumer Discretionary Portfolio PSCD might gain in the days ahead.As far as small-cap apparel and shoe companies are concerned, the likes of Stage Stores Inc. SSI, Boot Barn Holdings Inc. BOOT and Xcel Brands Inc (XELB) may benefit from the import tariff.There is a small-cap technology ETF for investors, namely, PowerShares S&P SmallCap Information Technology Portfolio (PSCT  -  Free Report). As far as stocks are concerned, Comtech Telecommunications Corp. (CMTL  -  Free Report) and Stoneridge Inc. (SRI  -  Free Report) are some of the companies one may consider.Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?    Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week. Get it free >>

1702,WYNN,"The casino gaming industry has been experiencing stellar growth since the second half of 2016. The bullish trend is expected to continue through 2018 and beyond. According to Research and Markets, the global casino gaming market is anticipated to witness CAGR of 10.16% in the 2017-2021 period. Technavio estimates that the U.S. casino gaming market will witness CAGR of close to 5% from 2017 to 2021.Recent numbers published by The Macau Gaming Inspection and Coordination Bureau are also encouraging. In February 2018, gross gaming revenues increased 5.7% year over year to roughly $3 billion or 24.3 billion patacas. This marked the 19th month of consecutive gains and the third highest in the past year.Although Nevada’s casino gaming win dropped by 2.1% in January, it crossed the $1 billion mark. Notably, it was the first time in the past 12 months that revenues were in excess of $1 billion.Despite the fact that demand in the space is relatively inelastic and a fixed range of consumers will continue to demand services irrespective of market conditions, there are good reasons why growth should persist over the next few years.Improving Tourism Dynamics Destinations like Las Vegas and Macau are gambling hotspots. The popularity of entertainment and gambling, in both hotels and casinos, has in fact aided these cities form a tourism economy unlike any other place on earth.The Chinese government is considering measures to support all aspects of Macau’s economy and introduce favorable policies. These are expected to improve visitation pattern and boost tourism and traffic in the region. One such move is the approval of Macau’s maritime expansion plans that are expected to aid shipping and tourism and mainland Chinese cities to offer multi-entry permits. Per the Macao Government Tourism Office (MGTO), total visitations to Macau in 2017 increased 5.4% from 2016.Though tourism in Las Vegas has not yet reached pre-recession levels, it is on its way to recovery. Per the year-end report from the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority, total visitors were down 1.7% year over year in 2017. However, convention attendance increased.Governments Reducing RestrictionsGiven the prospects of taxes (as high as 25%) on earnings and the fact that the gaming industry employs a large number of people, governments across the world are moving to reduce restrictions on gambling.In Nevada, the government has been lowering restrictions. Also, there is a new bill that could lower the legal gambling age limit from 21 to 18 years. In few states, for games such as bets on horse racing in Arkansas, Delaware, Florida, Indiana, Louisiana, Maine, New Mexico, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Washington, the legal age is already 18 years.Gambling remains illegal in Brazil and Japan but governments in both these countries are growing more receptive to the idea, which is a positive development for the industry.Tribal casinos in Alaska, Idaho, Minnesota and Wyoming are also legal for 18-year olds. Although the age group is not likely to have a lot of extra cash, this could expose them to gambling at an earlier age thereby increasing potential revenues for the industry in the future.Having More Money to SpendPer numbers provided by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), real disposable income rose through 2017. While it peaked in June and dropped thereafter owing to the impact of hurricanes Harvey and Irma, it has risen again and remains much higher than it was a year ago.Latest estimates from BEA suggest that personal income was up $64.7 billion (0.4 %) in January. Disposable personal income (DPI) rose $134.8 billion (0.9%) and personal consumption expenditures (PCE) was up $31.2 billion (0.2%). This is a positive for the gaming market as it indicates that people have more money to spend on leisure.The Japan ExpansionJapan is likely to hold the key for casino companies in 2018. The country is expected to approve two more gaming licenses in the year. Estimates indicate that Japan’s market could be worth $40 billion. Major casino players have made Japan their top priority for 2018, with Las Vegas Sands Corp. (LVS  -  Free Report) coming up with an outlay of around $10 billion for building a single resort.4 Stocks to Bet OnWith the help of the Zacks Stock Screener, we have zeroed in on four promising stocks in the gaming industry that have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy)  or Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and have solid expected earnings growth rate for 2018 as well as 2019.Eldorado Resorts, Inc (ERI  -  Free Report))Eldorado Resorts provides casino and entertainment services, primarily in Nevada and Louisiana.The company carries a Zacks Rank #1.

1705,WYNN,"Mattel, Inc. (MAT  -  Free Report) is grappling with the impacts of Toys “R” Us bankruptcy, sluggish performance of brands and pressure on margins.The company’s fourth-quarter 2017 results missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate on the earnings and revenues front. Both the metrics also declined significantly on a year-over-year basis.Additionally, Mattel has a dismal surprise history with the company missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all of the last four quarters, with an average negative surprise of 192.68%.In a year’s time, the company’s shares have lost 34.6% against the industry’s gain of 38.4%. Toys ‘R’ Us Bankruptcy Continues to Hurt RevenuesThe Toys ‘R’ Us’ Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing in September, 2017 has been an added concern for the already suffering toy industry players. Mattel’s gross sales decreased 9% in 2017 compared with the 2016 figure. Reversal of roughly $47 million of gross sales associated with Toys ""R"" Us bankruptcy filing led to the decline.Mattel, Inc. Revenue (TTM) Mattel, Inc. Revenue (TTM) | Mattel, Inc. Quote Major Brands Continue to UnderperformContinual sluggish performance of key brands is another strong reason behind decline of revenues in 2017. In fact, Mattel’s all the major brands have witnessed a decline in gross sales in the year compared with 2016. While revenues at Mattel Girls & Boys Brands declined 4%, the same at Fisher-Price Brands, American Girl Brands and Construction and Arts & Crafts Brands were down 11%, 21% and 29%, respectively.Margins Remain Under PressureDue to a simplified cost savings initiative that included write-downs of excess owned inventory and impairment of assets, the company’s adjusted gross margin contracted 850 basis points (bps) in 2017.Moving ahead, costs related to marketing and promotional initiatives, and cleaning up inventories coupled with the development of digital platforms are likely to keep margins under pressure. Thus, the company pushed out its longer-term target of achieving the low end of the 15-20% operating margin range from 2018 until 2019.To ConcludeAlthough the company continues to make strategic investments in its brands and focus on improving its point of sales (POS), it will take some time for all the brands to show consistent improvement. However, given the strong product line-up that includes core brands, licensed brands and lucrative product associations, Mattel remains well positioned for growth in the long term.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderMattel carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).A few better-ranked stocks in the Consumer Discretionary sector are Monarch Casino & Resort (MCRI  -  Free Report), Las Vegas Sands (LVS  -  Free Report) and Wynn Resorts (WYNN  -  Free Report), all carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

1710,WYNN,"Shares of Wynn Resorts (WYNN  -  Free Report) gained more than 8% in early morning trading hours Wednesday after the company announced that Steve Wynn has resigned from his position as CEO and chairman in the wake of a report alleging that the casino mogul engaged in decades of sexual misconduct.The details of Wynn’s alleged misconduct were first published in a Wall Street Journal report last month. Dozens of current and former employees described accounts that the Journal said amounted to “a decades-long pattern of sexual misconduct.”The report also revealed that Wynn once paid a $7.5 million settlement to a former manicurist at one of his resorts who claimed that Wynn pressured her into having sex with him. Wynn also allegedly pressured massage therapists to perform sex acts for $1,000 tips.Wynn’s behavior was known by the staff at some of his properties, and employees at the spa would often make fake appointments in an effort to avoid contact with him, the WSJ said (also read: Wynn Resorts Stock Plunges After CEO Accused of Sexual Misconduct).In statements issued after the original report, Wynn said that the idea that he ever assaulted any woman was “preposterous.” Nevertheless, the former CEO stepped down from his position as the Republican National Committee’s finance chief shortly after the Journal published its story.The trading of Wynn Macau shares on the Hong Kong stock exchange were halted ahead of today’s announcement. In a company statement, Wynn again refused to admit any wrongdoing and instead blamed the “environment” created by the allegations.“In the last couple of weeks, I have found myself the focus of an avalanche of negative publicity. As I have reflected upon the environment this has created—one in which a rush to judgment takes precedence over everything else, including the facts—I have reached the conclusion I cannot continue to be effective in my current roles,” Wynn said.Wynn Resorts announced that the company’s current president, Matt Maddox, would be taking over as CEO immediately. Shares of the casino and resort operator fell nearly 19% in the immediate aftermath of the WSJ report, and even with today’s gains, the stock is more than 11% off its 52-week high.Want more analysis from this author?

1712,WYNN,"The year 2017 has been an eventful journey thanks to the “Trump Factor” that led the market to scale new highs. Major indices like the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average and NASDAQ have gained 19.5%, 25.3% and 28%, respectively, in a year, and analysts see no reasons for the momentum to recede in 2018.Synopsis of 2017The market became witness to some major events, news and reforms in 2017 — the Fed raised benchmark interest rate thrice this year, unemployment rate reached its 17-year low rate, economy grew at a rate of 3% or more for two successive quarters, the new tax code finally passed, corporates reported sturdy earnings results and craze for cryptocurrencies rose. However, bitter memories of disasters caused by hurricane Harvey and Irma still linger.The year was also buzzing with some major acquisitions news such as — Amazon’s takeover of Whole Foods; Disney acquiring some assets of Twenty-First Century Fox; and Apple buying London-based music company Shazam. The story continues with Verizon concluding the buyout of Yahoo; EQT Corporation acquiring rival Rice Energy; and Gilead Sciences completing the acquisition of Kite Pharma.A favorable economic backdrop, major reforms and increase in infrastructure outlays are likely to spur domestic investments and stimulate growth. If the government ably channelizes the policies and implements pro-investors and pro-corporate reforms, Wall Street would continue to be ruled by bulls.Expectations for 2018With the U.S. economy firing on all cylinders and job market strengthening, the Fed advocates three more hikes in 2018 and chalked out a detailed plan to shrink $4.5 trillion portfolio of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities. The policy makers expect the unemployment rate to dip 20 basis points to 3.9% in 2018.Industry experts believe that the labor market is likely to get a major boost from Trump’s tax reform policy. Janet Yellen, whose term ends in February, pointed that any rational tax reform that triggers economic activities, helps create jobs and increase wages is always welcome. The Fed envisions economy to grow at a rate of 2.5% in both 2017 and 2018.With things looking great it is time you rejuvenate your portfolio.5 Prominent PicksHere we have highlighted five stocks with a favorable combination of a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and a VGM Score of A or B with a market cap of $2 billion or more.

In fact, non-gaming revenues have been relatively better over the past few quarters.We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year revenues is pegged at $12.7 billion, reflecting a year-over-year improvement of 11.1%.Las Vegas Sands has invested more than $13 billion in Macao since 2002 and plans to spend another $1.1 billion on new capital projects at Sands Cotai Central and the Four Seasons Hotel Macao over the next three years. Meanwhile, the operating environment has improved substantially in third-quarter 2017 and is expected to improve further.Mass and Non-Gaming Segments to Drive MarginsWhile some companies in the leisure industry are facing margin pressure, Las Vegas Sands’ EBITDA margins have been improving consistently owing to focus on mass and non-gaming segments that carry higher margins. These segments are expected to continue delivering margin growth and boost earnings. Notably, the company has delivered margins of more than 30% since the beginning of 2012.Arguably, earnings growth is of utmost importance for determining a stock’s potential as surging profit levels are often indicative of solid prospects and stock price gains.

1715,WYNN,"Does morality matter to you? If yes, then you may abhor the idea of putting money into “sin stocks” that are into activities considered unethical. However, products or services in this space are relatively inelastic, and business is recession-proof. The very nature of their business ensures a steady stream of consumers irrespective of market conditions, which eventually lead to higher margins and solid profits.And why not? While legalization of both recreational and medical marijuana will propel the pot industry to new highs, reduction in taxes will help alcohol producers save more. The cigarette industry, meanwhile, continues to make headway despite legal restrictions. As far as the gaming industry is concerned, growth in the Macau market and Japan opening to casinos will surely boost their bottom line heading into the New Year.But before we zero in on stocks from this tempting space, let’s take a look at what’s in store for these companies.Cannabis Sales Up This Year, With More Room to ExpandPer Marijuana Business Daily’s annual report, legal pot sales have skyrocketed 30% so far this year, which is equivalent to $5.1-$6.1 billion in total revenues. In fact, sales are expected to reach $6.7-$8.8 billion in the coming year, which will result in a whopping gain of at least 31%. Further, sales could top $17 billion by 2021.Such a stellar growth is possible, as a number of U.S. states have voted to legalize recreational pot. Legalization of recreational weed in the state of California is helping Cannabis stocks move north. California’s weed market is expected to open in January, with weeds costing around $500 a pound.Lest we forget, as of now, 29 states and the District of Columbia have already legalized the usage of medical marijuana. An increasing number of people are appreciating the medical value of marijuana as they believe it is safer compared to alcohol and a few other legal prescription drugs. Thus, medical marijuana industries in Illinois, Nevada and New York are poised to make the most as the pot market matures.Alcohol Producers See Reduced Taxes, Cigarette Industry Fights Regulations Recently, jubilant Republicans delivered a tax bill to President Donald Trump before Christmas, as promised. The Republican tax plan got the final approval by the House that gave Corporate America a massive permanent tax break. The tax bill also has a provision that will give alcohol producers a two-year reduction in federal excise tax worth $4.2 billion. Reduction in such taxes will encompass brewers, distilleries and wineries.Kevin McElroy, the lead brewer at Random Row Brewing company, said, “I think it's great,” as the company will save $3.50 per barrel of beer from the tax break. He added that the new provision will save them $1,500 to $2,000 next year.However, the same cannot be said of the U.S. tobacco industry. Cigarette sales have fallen considerably in the U.S. as the industry witnessed an increase in federal excise tax. The industry also faces stiff regulations and restrictions. Nevertheless, despite cigarette sales tanking, sales of flavored cigars continue to gain traction. Menthol cigarettes, meanwhile, continue to hold a constant market share. Smart marketing and advertising moves played a major role in helping the cigarette industry stay afloat.Gambling Stocks Make Attractive Buys – Macau is the KeyThe year 2017 has been superb for gaming stocks, with Wynn Resorts (WYNN  -  Free Report) and Melco Resorts (MLCO  -  Free Report) comfortably outperforming the broader market. The climb in casino stocks was mostly due to the uptick in Macau’s gambling market. In the first 11 months of this year, revenues surged 19.5%. Macau’s momentum has also been hitting highs lately, giving investors enough reason to be bullish going into next year.That said, the big expansion for casino companies in 2018 will be in Japan. The country is expected to approve two more gaming licenses next year, while estimates are that Japan’s market could be worth $40 billion. Major casino players have made Japan their top priority for next year with an outlay of around $10 billion in building a single resort. This property from Las Vegas Sands Corp. (LVS  -  Free Report) will eventually become the biggest license opening since Singapore, a key market for owners of integrated resorts.Top 5 Sin Stocks to Buy for 2018As mentioned above, sinful stocks are well poised to gain traction in next year. Such stocks not only celebrate good times but are also useful during recessionary periods. We have selected five solid stocks from the pot, alcohol, tobacco and gaming industries.

1720,WYNN,"With nearly a fortnight left to ring in a New Year, we note that 2017 has been quite a delight for investors. The market depicted a solid bull run this year, steered by a rebounding U.S. economy that has been riding on an improved labor market, higher consumer spending, increased business investments and favorable government spending.This is quite evident from the latest GDP data which suggests that the U.S. economy improved at a better-than-expected rate in the third quarter. Per the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the second estimate for third-quarter GDP jumped at an annual rate of 3.3%, marking the fastest pace over the past three years. The underlying strength in the economy paved the way for a rate hike for the third time this year.These factors, which have driven major indices, also give out positive signals for 2018. Evidently, the S&P 500, Nasdaq and Dow Jones have rallied 19.1%, 15.2% and 24.3%, respectively, so far this year.Consumer Stocks a Safe Haven: Here’s WhyWhile the economic expansion has been quite broad-based, consumer stocks seem to be major gainers. Despite facing disruptions from hurricanes, these stocks have been gaining from improved labor market and bolstered consumer confidence. Per the Conference Board data, the Consumer Confidence Index surged to 129.5 in November, the highest in about 17 years.

1723,WYNN,"Consumers, who are the core of all economic activity, have shown profound optimism lately as is evident from the increased consumer confidence, consumer spending and stable job scenario. Consumers’ favorable position also reflects a steady U.S. economy, which is poised for growth.The commerce department revealed that annual gross domestic product (GDP) rose 3.3% in third-quarter 2017 (second estimate), above the advance reading of 3% and up from 3.1% growth in the preceding quarter. This growth was supported by increases in consumer spending, inventory investment, business investment, and exports.Consumer spending rose 2.3% in the third quarter. Further, initial holiday period sales data (during the Thanksgiving weekend) suggests that consumers are increasingly spending on restaurants, clothing, electronics, fuel and groceries in November.Moreover, consumers’ optimism is well reflected in the Consumer Confidence data, which increased for the fifth straight month and remains at a 17-year high in November. The Conference Board’s Consumer Confidence Index surged to 129.5 in November from October’s reading of 126.2.A major reason for the high consumer confidence is consumers’ expectations of further improvement in labor market. Notably, the labor market remains attractive with a gradual decline in unemployment rate. The unemployment rate has gone down significantly to 4.1% in November from 4.8% in January.The uptick in the U.S. economy is well supported by the bullish run of the stock markets in 2017. Major stock indices Nasdaq Composite Index, the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average registered year-to-date growths of 15.2%, nearly 20% and 24.3%, respectively. Not surprisingly, investors can make the most of this market momentum by investing in stocks that have crushed these indices in 2017.Why Consumer Discretionary Sector?Well, spending on discretionary items which form a part of the Consumer Discretionary sector is largely dependent on consumers’ spending appetite. Given the favorable background discussed above, consumers are currently willing to spend on discretionary items like durable goods, apparel, entertainment and leisure, and automobiles.The Consumer Discretionary sector growth trends since the start of 2017 have been very appeasing. Markedly, the sector recorded 17.1% growth year to date, slightly lagging the 19.9% upside of the S&P 500. Further, it carries a Zacks Sector Rank of #9 (out of 16).Hence, there lies an opportunity to invest in Consumer Discretionary stocks that have outpaced major indices, to make the best of the improving economic situation.5 Consumer Stocks that Outpaced the MarketThat said, we bring five Consumer Discretionary stocks that not only outpaced the market in 2017 but are expected to outperform in the coming years.

1724,WYNN,"Perhaps it is because trading stocks can often mirror the thrill of winning big at the blackjack tables, or maybe it is because Las Vegas conjures images of the world’s most flashy brands and businessmen. Regardless of the reason, it is clear that gambling stocks are always among the most popular on Wall Street.Luckily for investors, now is also a great time to be buying gambling stocks, as continued Vegas strength, a great recovery in Macau, and overall international interest in gaming have led to rising share prices. What’s more, the U.S. Supreme Court just overturned a decades-long ban on sports betting, opening the door for many new legal gambling avenues soon.According to our Zacks Industry Rank data, the overall “Gaming” industry has outpaced the S&P 500 over the past year and on a year-to-date basis. With casino stocks this hot right now, investors are not going to want to miss out.Luckily, we can use Zacks’ proven stock-picking methods to find solid stocks in any industry. Check out these casino stocks today:1. Melco Resorts & Entertainment Ltd. (MLCO  -  Free Report)Melco receives the majority of its revenue from Macau, so the company has benefitted from the continued recovery in the region. Analysts are warming on MLCO, with three positive revisions to its full-year EPS estimates coming in the past 60 days. This has moved the Zacks Consensus Estimate 18 cents higher and earned the stock a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Melco is now expected to witness earnings growth of 45% in 2018. The stock is trading with a slightly-stretched P/E of 22.6, but its PEG of 1.9 implies that investors are still getting a decent price for its growth trajectory. The company’s dividend yield of 1.8% is also worth mentioning, and that could be on the cusp of improving thanks to cash flow growth of 29%. 2. Penn National Gaming, Inc. (PENN  -  Free Report)Penn National Gaming is an operator of a number of casino and gambling properties in North America, specifically located in smaller markets and non-Vegas gambling hotspots. Recently, analysts at Morgan Stanley called the Supreme Court gambling verdict as a “slight positive for regional gaming stocks” and named PENN as one that could benefit the most.Penn National is also currently holding a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). The stock has also been one of the hottest gaming picks on Wall Street recently, surging more than 30% in the past three months and nearly 64% in the last year. Still, with new growth catalysts ahead, PENN could very well break higher. 3. Las Vegas Sands Corp. (LVS  -  Free Report)With properties like the Venetian and the Parisian, Las Vegas Sands is the epitome of luxury and style in the casino industry. LVS is only sporting a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) right now, but the company has solid growth prospects and feels like a long-term play for a variety of reasons.

1725,WYNN,"For the Global Week Ahead, let’s visit Reuter’s five top world market themes.These are the ones likely to dominate the thinking of investors and traders in the coming week. It’s been a great year for stocks outside the U.S. We are about to move into a New Year with fresh share price momentum -- everywhere.(1) The Bank of Japan (BoJ) Will Be in Midweek HeadlinesThe Bank of Japan holds the last of this year’s major central bank meetings.Japan’s economy is now into its best period of expansion this century, the labor market continues to improve, and bank lending is booming. Yet the BOJ’s stimulus remains pretty much at full throttle, having already ballooned its balance sheet to the same size as Japan’s GDP.Keeping the yen from appreciating and thus disturbing the cyclical tailwinds of growth seems to have become a major reason why the BOJ is a laggard on policy ‘normalization.’Some BOJ policymakers have been dropping subtle hints to prepare markets for an eventual exit from its policy -- one that keeps short-term rates negative and pegs the 10-year yield to zero percent -- but investors expect little guidance around that exit plan at next week’s meeting.The first changes may come via a small rise in the 10-year yield target, they suspect, but even the odds of that are low so long as wage growth is subdued and inflation remains well below the BOJ’s 2 percent target. (2) Fresh U.S. Housing Data – Pay Attention to the DetailsFresh U.S. figures on existing home sales and housing starts could point to a continued deceleration going into 2018.On a 12-month percentage change, dating back to 2000, both data series reveal how the housing market is softening.The Federal Reserve’s interest-rate cycle has been a major factor -- in particular, short-term mortgages, where interest rates on floating-rate home loans have risen the most, making life harder for some would-be buyers.One of the conundrums though is that the White House wants to juice up the economy with tax cuts while the Federal Reserve wants to keeping raising interest rates so they get back to more normal levels. (3) A Snap Election in the Catalan Province of SpainOn Thursday, a snap election takes places in Catalonia. The Spanish government hopes the vote will put an end to the wealthy region’s independence bid.One recent poll suggested pro-independence parties may fail to retain an absolute majority of seats in the Catalan parliament, with pro-unity parties poised to increase their vote share.Failure to win a majority in the regional parliament would be a blow for Catalan separatists who have billed the Dec. 21st election as a de facto plebiscite on Madrid’s decision to impose direct rule in October following an independence referendum. Spanish bonds and stocks markets, both unnerved by the political crisis, have recovered ground.Any signs that the election will bring calm to the Eurozone’s fourth biggest economy should cheer investors -- and give them plenty of time focus on elections likely to be held in Italy early next year. (4) Pay Attention to South Africa’s Presidential ElectionOn Sunday, South Africa’s ruling African National Congress (ANC) party is expected to anoint its next leader.But whoever wins, the chances of the party splitting in two have grown.The bruising battle to choose the successor to President Jacob Zuma between business-friendly Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa and Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, a former cabinet minister and ex-wife of President Jacob Zuma, is too close to call.The rand has performed well in recent weeks on expectations that Ramaphosa will clinch the victory. But the complexity of the leadership contest means the outcome is far from certain.So investors who had been hoping for political stability and a chance for the country to enact some much-needed structural reforms could be disappointed. (5) Will This Be the Best Year for Global Stocks Since 2013, or 2009?There’s just one full trading week left to the end of the year.Perhaps one of the few remaining issues to decide markets-wise is this: Was this the best in year in global stocks since 2013 or 2009?Right now 2017 is vying with 2013, with gains just above +20% year-to-date seen in both. The crash recovery year of 2009 clocked up more than +30% and stocks are well shy of that. Top Zacks #1 Rank (STRONG BUY) Stocks—Asahi Kasei (AHKSY  -  Free Report): This is a big $18 billion in market cap diversified Japanese chemical maker. The stock is trading at about $26 a share after a strong run.The global chemical markets are a key bellwether to watch, and the strong rank here is good news for global growth centered in Asia.NVR (NVR  -  Free Report): This is a $13 billion in market cap building products-home builder. U.S. housing figures out this week can move Zacks #1 Rank stocks like this.NVR, Inc. operates in two business segments: homebuilding and mortgage banking. Again, this is a stock already on a big momentum roll this year, in a hot industry.Wynn Resorts (WYNN  -  Free Report): This $16 billion market cap casino stock keeps going up. And the Zacks #1 Rank says the business is getting more and more profitable.Will final tax bill passage keep these types of gaming stocks on a roll? I bet it does. Key Global Macro—In the U.S., we likely see the final passage of the tax bill, during the week.Argentina’s GDP growth rate, out on Wednesday, may be an eye catcher.Wednesday’s Riksbank decision won’t alter the policy repo rate (-0.5%) but guidance on timing the first rate hike since 2011 will be carefully scrutinized.At the same time, the Bank of Japan is likely to maintain mostly unchanged stimulus measures, but again, there are negative rates in play. Any change to them would be big news.On Monday, the unemployment rate in Hong Kong is +3.0%The Eurozone CPI was +1.4% y/y. We get a fresh reading.Brazil’s proxy GDP comes out. The forecast is for +2.4% y/y.On Tuesday, the composite interest rate for Hong Kong gets re-set. It is 0.5%, which sounds low, given the Fed rate hike and the low unemployment rate there.U.S. building permits come out. The prior was 1.316M.On Wednesday, the Bank of Japan (BoJ) issues a policy statement and Governor Kuroda holds a press conference. The overnight rate in Japan is now at -0.1%.Sweden’s Riksbank will re-issue guidance on its negative interest rate, now set at -0.5%. That negative rate decision is what is interesting here. No change is expected.Argentina is in a bit of a turnaround. Its prior GDP growth rate was +2.7% y/y, and the forecast is for that to rise to +4.3% y/y.On Thursday, U.S. weekly initial claims for unemployment come out. The last weekly reading was a super low 225K. This one should be low too, with Xmas seasonal hiring picking up any slack here.Mexico’s pesky high consumer inflation rate is revisited. The prior was +6.67% y/y, and the forecast is for +6.64% y/y.On Friday, the University of Michigan sentiment index gets a fresh visit. The prior was 96.8.

1726,WYNN,"Earnings growth and valuation multiples are indeed important for investors to determine a stock's ability to offer considerable returns. But these are also essential in determining whether a stock’s price performance is better than its peers or the industry average.If the stock’s performance is lacking that of the broader groups despite impressive earnings growth or valuation multiples, then something must be wrong.It’s always advisable to stay away from these stocks and bet on those that are outperforming their respective industries or benchmarks. This is because betting on a winner always increases the odds of winning.Then again, it is imperative that you determine whether or not an investment has relevant upside potential when considering stocks with significant relative price strength. Stocks delivering better than the S&P 500 over a period of 1 to 3 months at the least and having solid fundamentals indicate room for growth, and are the best ways to go about this strategy.Finally, it is important to find out whether analysts are optimistic about the upcoming earnings results of these companies.

1727,WYNN,"As we head into 2018, many investors are beginning to evaluate their investment portfolios and make adjustments. But one thing that is unlikely to change in the New Year is the hunt for companies that are set to grow their bottom lines.Investors are likely to keep their positions in the Apples (AAPL  -  Free Report) and Alphabets (GOOGL  -  Free Report) of the world in 2018, even after tech stocks helped send markets to new highs in 2017. However, it is never too early to look at other companies projected to see their earnings surge in the coming year—especially those stocks that don’t often appear in headlines.With that said, let’s take a look at three great growth stocks with high Zacks Ranks, which are also poised to experience substantial EPS gains in 2018.1.       Wynn Resorts, Limited (WYNN  -  Free Report)This resort and gaming giant is currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and sports an “A” grade for Growth in our Style Scores system. Wynn also earned an overall “B” VGM score. In the fourth quarter of 2017, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimates, Wynn is projected to see its EPS skyrocket by 163.66%. And this positive momentum looks like it will be carried over into 2018.Within the last 60 days, the company has received five upward earnings estimate revisions for its full fiscal year 2018, sending our consensus estimate 46 cents higher over that timeframe. Furthermore, Wynn is expected to see its EPS jump by 20.82% to hit $6.45 in fiscal 2018. This substantial gain comes after the company’s 2017 earnings are projected to surge 57%.2.       Arista Networks, Inc. (ANET  -  Free Report)Arista Networks delivers software-driven, cloud computing networking solutions for data centers. The company is currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and rocks a “B” grade for Growth in our Style Scores system. Shares of Arista have soared 125.54% in 2017 but have slipped in the last four weeks, which could allow investors to buy on the dip.Looking ahead to 2018, Arista’s earnings are expected to climb 15% to reach $6.14 per share, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimates. This bottom line growth projection coincides with the company’s full-year 2017 expansion expectations, which currently calls for 61% EPS growth.Our consensus estimate for ANET’s full-year 2018 earnings has improved by 61 cents in the last 60 days. During this same time frame, Arista has earned four upward earnings estimate revisions, against no downgrades.3.       LendingTree, Inc. (TREE  -  Free Report)Shares of this online loan marketplace powerhouse have skyrocketed 208% this year and currently rest at their 52-week high. But Lending Tree stock could be poised to keep climbing in 2018. The company is currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and sports a “B” grade for Growth.Within the last 60 days, Lending Tree’s full-year 2018 Zacks Consensus Estimate has improved by 60 cents. In this same time frame, the company has earned two upward earnings estimate revisions for 2018, against no downgrades. The company is expected to see its top line jump by 23% in 2018, based on our Zacks Consensus Estimates. However, the company’s EPS is projected to double that growth rate to hit $5.35 per share in fiscal 2018, which would mark a 44.64% surge.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

1728,WYNN,"On Friday, The Wall Street Journal published a bombshell report saying that Wynn Resorts (WYNN  -  Free Report) founder and CEO Steve Wynn engaged in a “decades-long pattern of sexual misconduct.” Shares of the casino giant have taken quite the hit on the news, and are currently down nearly 10% to $180.78 per share in late afternoon trading.According to the Journal, Wynn paid $7.5 million in order to settle a claim brought by a former manicurist at his resort, who said that Wynn pressured her into having sex with him against her will.In a statement, Wynn said that “the idea that I ever assaulted any woman is preposterous.”Wynn also pressured massage therapists to perform sex acts for $1,000 tips, and other employees at the spa would set up fake appointments so that they would avoid contact with him, said the WSJ. Many of the women who came forward said they reported the harassment to supervisors or casino executives.The Journal said it contacted more than 150 current and former employees, but notes that many of those who spoke out worried about their job opportunities because of Wynn’s huge influence throughout the casino industry.Additionally, the newspaper detailed the ongoing lawsuit between Wynn and his ex-wife Elaine Wynn, who is trying to get control of her 9% stake in the company; the $7.5 million settlement has become a major part of this legal battle.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time. It’s a once-in-a-generation opportunity to invest in pure genius. Click for details >>

The company also delivered positive earnings surprises in three of the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 15.4%.Per our VGM Score, which identifies the most attractive value, growth and momentum characteristics, Wynn Resorts has a Growth Score of A reflecting the stock’s high growth potential.Why Pick Wynn Resorts?Estimated Earnings and Revenues: A strong brand portfolio and vigorous domestic expansion lend Wynn Resorts an advantageous position compared to peers in the gaming and lodging industry. In order to boost performance in Las Vegas, the company has remodeled rooms at its properties and have initiated several traffic driving initiatives. Additionally, in the highly competitive operating space of Las Vegas, the company offers various promotional allowances to retain its market share. By distributing higher incentives to gambling patrons and providing a robust return, Wynn Resorts is slated for strong growth.Arguably, earnings growth is of utmost importance for determining a stock’s potential as surging profit levels are often indicative of strong prospects (and stock price gains). For the current year, Wynn Resorts’ earnings per share are expected to grow 57.4%, higher than the industry’s 2.9% growth. Moreover, year-over-year sales growth for the current year is expected at 37.9%.Return on Equity (ROE): Wynn Resorts delivered a ROE of nearly 133% in the trailing 12 months, compared with the industry’s gain of 7.1%. This shows that the company reinvests more efficiently compared to peers.Industry Backdrop: Being a leading developer, owner and operator of casino resorts, part of Wynn Resorts’ revenues is influenced by the global games market scenario.

1731,WYNN,"On Monday, the United States Supreme Court will hear oral arguments in Christie v. NCAA—a case that could eventually lead to legalized sports gambling throughout the U.S.Outgoing New Jersey Governor Chris Christie has pushed to overturn the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA). This 1992 statute prohibits states, aside from Nevada and a few others, from implementing sports gambling. Now, the high court is finally set to hand down a decision that could possibly change the entire U.S. gambling landscape.Betting on professional and collegiate sports is a multibillion-dollar a year industry, yet it is still illegal in most cases. In recent years, NBA commissioner Adam Silver has come out in favor of legalized sports gambling, and other heads of pro leagues have started to join the pro-betting group. However, Roger Goodell has not backed down from his stance that the NFL will not support legalized sports betting, even as a team moves to Las Vegas. The decision, which is not expected to be announced until the spring, has the NCAA, NFL, NBA, MLB, NHL and casino companies on edge as the slow process begins next week.With that said, let’s take a look at three casino and gaming stocks that are thriving now, as the betting world readies for a possible industry shakeup down the line.Wynn Resorts, Limited (WYNN  -  Free Report)Wynn is currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and sports an “A” grade for Growth in our Style Scores System. Within the last 60 days, the company has received four upward earnings estimate revisions for its current quarter against no downgrades. Within this same time frame, Wynn earned the same four to zero upgrade ratio for its full-year earnings.Last quarter, this casino and resort giant’s revenues soared 45.3% to hit $1.61 billion. Wynn Resorts’ third-quarter sales were spurred in part by a 15.3% year-over-year jump in Wynn Macau revenues, which hit $597.4 million.Wynn’s fourth-quarter EPS is projected to skyrocket 163.34%, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimates. For the full-year, our estimates are calling for the company’s earnings to climb 57.37%.In terms of top-line growth, Wynn’s Q4 sales are projected to jump 17.78%. On top of that, full-year revenues are expected to hit $6.16 billion, which would mark a 37.9% year-over-year jump. What’s more, Wynn’s cash flow growth of 11.91% destroys the “Gaming” industry’s 2.97% decline and helps demonstrate the company’s growing cash position.Shares of Wynn have surged 80.41% this year, blowing away the S&P 500’s 15.51% gain. With this climb, the company’s stock price currently sits right near its 52-week high of $160.00 per share. But if the company can match or top the massive Q4 growth estimates, Wynn should have no problem keeping its hot streak alive.William Hill plc (WIMHY  -  Free Report)This U.K.-headquartered sports betting and gaming company is currently Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and also scores an overall “A” VGM score. Shares of William Hill have skyrocketed almost 22% since the end of October, and the company’s stock price currently sits near its 52-week high of $15.75 per share.William Hill rocks an “A” grade for Value in our Style Scores system, with the sports gaming company currently trading at 12.28x earnings. This solid P/E ratio marks a massive discount compared to the Gaming industry’s 29.25 average. On top of that, William Hill’s P/B ratio of 2.11 matches its industry’s average.The company rocks an “A” grade for Growth in our Style Scores system, which its 5.83% full-year EPS growth projection helps to demonstrate. Along with bottom line growth, the company’s sales are projected to grow by 2.71%, based on our consensus estimates. William Hill also offers a solid 3.71% dividend.This gaming company also stands to gain if sports betting is legalized outside of Vegas, as it currently operates in the U.S and could expand into a number of new states.Churchill Downs Incorporated (CHDN  -  Free Report)Churchill Downs is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). The company’s stock price has skyrocketed 47.39% since the start of the year, which nearly doubles its industry’s average. Shares of this company known for its legendary horse race gained over 6.20% on Thursday and hit a new 52-week high of $235.65 per share.This big jump came after Churchill Downs, which owns five racetracks and six casinos, announced on Wednesday that it sold its mobile gaming subsidiary, Big Fish Games, for $990 million in an all-cash deal.Last quarter, Churchill Downs’ Q3 revenues grew 4% year-over-year to hit $314.8 million. On top of that, the company’s net income soared 92% to reach $16.7 million. The company’s Q4 sales are expected to climb 7.87%, based on our Zacks Consensus Estimates. For the full-year, revenues are projected to hit $1.34 billion, which would mark a 2.72% gain.Our estimates call for CHDN’s EPS to pop 26.47% in its fourth-quarter and 29.27% for the full year. Furthermore, within the last 60 days, Churchill Downs has received one upward earnings estimates revisions for its current quarter against no downgrades. Within this same time frame, the company has also earned two full-year upward revisions.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

1733,WYNN,"Perhaps it is because trading stocks can often mirror the thrill of winning big at the blackjack tables, or maybe it is because Las Vegas conjures images of the world’s most flashy brands and businessmen. Regardless of the reason, it is clear that gambling stocks are always among the most popular on Wall Street.Luckily for investors, now is also a great time to be buying gambling stocks, as continued Vegas strength, a great recovery in Macau, and overall international interest in gaming have led to rising share prices. What’s more, the U.S. Supreme Court just overturned a decades-long ban on sports betting, opening the door for many new legal gambling avenues soon.According to our Zacks Industry Rank data, the overall “Gaming” industry has outpaced the S&P 500 over the past year and on a year-to-date basis. With casino stocks this hot right now, investors are not going to want to miss out.Luckily, we can use Zacks’ proven stock-picking methods to find solid stocks in any industry. Check out these casino stocks today:1. Melco Resorts & Entertainment Ltd. (MLCO  -  Free Report)Melco receives the majority of its revenue from Macau, so the company has benefitted from the continued recovery in the region. Analysts are warming on MLCO, with three positive revisions to its full-year EPS estimates coming in the past 60 days. This has moved the Zacks Consensus Estimate 18 cents higher and earned the stock a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Melco is now expected to witness earnings growth of 45% in 2018. The stock is trading with a slightly-stretched P/E of 22.6, but its PEG of 1.9 implies that investors are still getting a decent price for its growth trajectory. The company’s dividend yield of 1.8% is also worth mentioning, and that could be on the cusp of improving thanks to cash flow growth of 29%. 2. Penn National Gaming, Inc. (PENN  -  Free Report)Penn National Gaming is an operator of a number of casino and gambling properties in North America, specifically located in smaller markets and non-Vegas gambling hotspots. Recently, analysts at Morgan Stanley called the Supreme Court gambling verdict as a “slight positive for regional gaming stocks” and named PENN as one that could benefit the most.Penn National is also currently holding a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). The stock has also been one of the hottest gaming picks on Wall Street recently, surging more than 30% in the past three months and nearly 64% in the last year. Still, with new growth catalysts ahead, PENN could very well break higher. 3. Las Vegas Sands Corp. (LVS  -  Free Report)With properties like the Venetian and the Parisian, Las Vegas Sands is the epitome of luxury and style in the casino industry. LVS is only sporting a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) right now, but the company has solid growth prospects and feels like a long-term play for a variety of reasons. The stock has an “A” grade for Growth in our Style Scores system, and management looks to be balancing the books well.Las Vegas Sands is generating cash flow growth of 21% right now. The firm is now bringing in about $4.63 in cash per share, more than quadrupling its industry’s average. LVS also boasts a better-than-average net margin of 28% and RoE 36%. Finally, management is currently offering a dividend yield of about 4%. Want more market analysis from this author?

1734,WYNN,"The casino gaming market has seen steady growth since the June 2016 quarter and there’s nothing to suggest that there will be a reversal in this growth trend. On the other hand, there are good reasons why growth should continue over the next few years.A Little Government SupportThe most important if unlikely of these is government support. Gambling is of course illegal, yet the prospect of taxes (as high as 25%) on earnings is attractive and can be used by any welfare state to build schools, infrastructure and so forth. Besides, the industry employs a large number of people and therefore has an impact on the jobs market. So governments cross the world are moving to reduce restrictions on gambling.The Chinese government crackdown on illegal fund transfers from mainland China to Macao was a big blow for the gambling business there. But new resorts with a focus on leisure rather than pure gambling are helping players return to the black. Gambling remains illegal in Brazil and Japan, but governments in both these countries are growing more receptive to the idea, which is a positive development for the industry.Back home in Nevada, the government has been lowering restrictions and there’s a new bill that could lower the legal gambling age limit from 21 to 18 years. In some states and for some types of games such as bets on horse racing in Arkansas, Delaware, Florida, Indiana, Louisiana, Maine, New Mexico, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Washington, the legal age is already 18 years.Tribal casinos in Alaska, Idaho, Minnesota and Wyoming are also legal for 18-year olds. While the age group isn’t likely to have a lot of extra cash, this could expose them to the thing at an earlier age, potentially increasing revenue for the industry.There’s also another aspect to legalization, which is the reduction of unaccounted for transactions resulting in black money. For instance, sports betting is illegal in most countries, although people spend and make millions from it. So this money often leaves the concerned country to safe havens.A Little Extra CashAccording to numbers provided by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), the real disposable income has been rising through 2017. While it peaked in June and dropped off thereafter because of the impact of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, it has been growing again since then and remains much higher than it was a year ago. While personal consumption has also been rising (most of the increase is in food and energy), the trend is positive for the gaming market overall because it indicates that people have more money to spend on leisure.A Little ConvenienceMillennials are a digital race, so they’re used to getting most of what they need on their electronic gadgets, usually mobile devices. As a result, there is an increased focus on online gaming, including DFS, lottery, poker and casino games. Technavio says that traditional channels still account for 93% of all gaming revenue in the U.S., but since the younger crowd is moving to online channels, that scenario could change quickly. So regulators are also taking stock. It’s likely that online channels will be increasingly legalized going forward.A Lot More VarietyThe prospect of betting on online sports immediately opens up a new category in eSports that has become hugely popular through titles like League of Legends, Call of Duty, Street Fighter, Dota 2, etc. The participation and viewership on these games is huge and the category is likely to explode over the next few years (it’s already giving away millions of dollars in prize money) given Amazon’s purchase of Twitch, YouTube’s launching of YouTube Gaming and even media shops like ESPN jumping into the scene to broadcast the games.Goldman Sachs via BI Insights estimates that the market will grow at a CAGR of 22% over the next three years from $500 million in 2016 to $1 billion in 2019. The firm estimates that 300 million people view eSports today and by 2020, that number will be as high as 500 million. Newzoo estimates that the market will grow from $493 million in 2016 to $1.1 billion in 2019. Market research firm Eilers & Krejcik Gaming estimates that eSports betting turnover is likely to reach $23 billion by 2020 with operators generating more than $1.8 billion in related revenue.The increase in the popularity of gambling apps and social gambling will also be major drivers.Another thing that can excite/interest younger gamers is a skill based return to player, such as GameCo’s Danger Arena, a patent pending video game gambling machine. The slot machine is designed to generate higher returns to more skilled players while also ensuring some returns to low-skill players. An element of chance is also built in.  Growth RatesThe global casino gaming market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 10.16% during the period 2017-2021, according to Research and Markets. Technavio estimates that the U.S. casino gaming market will grow at a CAGR of close to 5% from 2017 to 2021.The Macau Gaming Inspection and Coordination Bureau has published encouraging numbers: gross gaming revenues for October increased 22.1% year over year to roughly $3.3 billion or 26.6 billion patacas (the highest since 2014, indicating that the impact of Chinese regulatory actions have blown over).The Nevada Gaming Control Board estimates that gambling revenues in the state increased nearly 3.3% in September 2017 from a year ago to $979.9 million with particular strength in casino revenues from the Las Vegas Strip, which grew 4.7%. Reno revenues were up 9.2%.The Zacks-categorized gaming market has grown revenue steadily from the June quarter of 2016 with the gross margin growing from the March quarter of 2016 and net income before non-recurring items growing from the September quarter.So let’s take a look at the picks for today-Wynn Resorts Limited (WYNN  -  Free Report)Wynn Resorts owns and operates Wynn Las Vegas and Encore in Las Vegas; as well as Wynn Macau (including Encore) and the Wynn Palace in the Special Administrative Region of Macau in the People's Republic of China.

1742,WYNN,"Yesterday’s selling pressure planted a seed of doubt in the market’s head. I called it a technical move stemming from the Nikkei which translated on through to risk-off in the US.

1744,WYNN,"Las Vegas Sands Corp. (LVS  -  Free Report) is slated to release fourth-quarter 2017 numbers on Jan 24, after market close. The company’s top line in the to-be-reported quarter is expected to be driven by strength across its Asia and domestic operations.Shares of the company have rallied 18.8% in the past six months, outperforming the industry’s gain of 13.4%.Let’s take a look at how the company’s net revenues will take shape in the to-be-reported quarter. Revenues From Asian Operations Likely to IncreaseLas Vegas Sands sees tremendous potential to upgrade and expand its Macao properties and continues to invest heavily toward this end. We believe that fourth quarter will bear the fruits of continual focus in expanding both gaming and non-gaming services in Asia.Per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, Sands Cotai Central revenues are expected to grow 6.5% in the fourth quarter from the prior-year quarter. This is notably against the downtrend over the first nine months of 2017, when net revenues fell 8.9% year over year.The consensus estimate for fourth-quarter revenues in Venetian Macao reflects 1.4% year-over-year growth, despite the first nine months of 2017 seeing a 1.9% year-over-year decline in the resort’s revenues.Further, Sands Macao revenues are expected to witness 0.6% year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter of 2017. However, it saw a 7.8% decline in the first nine months of 2017, compared to the previous year.Although revenues in The Plaza Macao and Four Seasons Hotel Macao are expected to decrease 9.2% from the fourth quarter of 2016, the consensus estimate projects sequential growth in the to-be-reported quarter. However, net revenues at these resorts fell 1.6% in the first nine months of 2017 from the year-ago level.Marina Bay Sands in Singapore is expected to record net revenue growth of 7.3% in fourth-quarter 2017, as compared with the year-ago level. In fact, in the first nine months of 2017, the resort recorded 12.2% year-over-year revenue growth.Growth Driving Efforts in Las Vegas to Pay OffThe company is focusing on renovation and promotion of its Las Vegas properties in order to drive segmental performance. The improvement in employment rate and the rise in tourism numbers in the region have been boosting demand at the company’s properties in the region. Further, the diversification of its resort portfolio and non-gaming options would contribute highly to revenues.The consensus estimate projects revenues from Las Vegas operations at $396 million in the fourth quarter, reflecting 4.8% sequential growth. Moreover, in the first nine months of 2017, revenues from Las Vegas operations increased 6.3% a year ago.Our TakeWe believe that the company’s solid business model, extensive non-gaming revenue opportunities, high quality assets and attractive property locations will continue to help gain traction in the to-be-reported quarter. Moreover, some entertainment offerings in the pipeline are expected to deliver profitable results across the company’s properties in the fourth quarter.Subsequently, the consensus estimate for fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $3.21 billion, reflecting 4.2% year-over-year growth.Las Vegas Sands Corp.

1745,WYNN,"Last week was quite eventful for the gambling industry as Macau's gaming revenues rose for the 15th consecutive month in October. This indicates that the casino hub is firmly on its path to recovery from the two-year slump stemming from China's anti-graft corruption drive and slow economic growth.Additionally, the Nevada Gaming Control Board announced an increase in revenues in the region in September.On the one hand, Melco Resorts & Entertainment Limited (MLCO  -  Free Report) came up with better-than-expected third-quarter 2017 results. On the other hand, Eldorado Resorts, Inc. (ERI  -  Free Report) posted mixed results, wherein earnings compared favorably with the Zacks Consensus Estimate but revenues missed the same.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories  1.    Per the Macau Gaming Inspection and Coordination Bureau, gross gaming revenues for October increased 22.1% on a yearly basis to roughly $3.3 billion or 26.6 billion patacas (the highest revenue figure since 2014) with robust demand gaining an added boost from a national holiday week. In fact, the improvement was above a 16.1% increase recorded in September 2017.Markedly, a tough operating environment in Macau has been weighing on casino stocks since June 2014 to the most part of 2016. The crackdown on corruption in China compelled Macau officials to impose restrictions on high rollers to stop billions of dollars from being siphoned off illegally from mainland China to Macau. Consequently, this lowered footfall at local casinos. A slowdown in China, tighter visa policies, political unrest and a smoking ban on mass market gaming floors compounded the woes.However, Macau's gambling revenues have been rising since the second half of 2016, with new resorts attracting high rollers and leisure gamblers.Also, efforts undertaken by Macau operators to revive revenues by wooing tourists and recreational gamblers with family-friendly resorts and more non-gaming facilities have started yielding results. This is evident from revenue growth in the past 15 months.Thus, it seems that the worst is over for Macau’s gambling industry and a complete rebound in the region may be in the cards.2.    According to the Nevada Gaming Control Board, gambling revenues in the state increased nearly 3.3% in September 2017 from the year-ago period to $979.9 million. Particularly, casino revenues in the Las Vegas Strip — which account for more than half of Nevada’s total revenues — were up 4.7% year over year in the month. Reno recorded a 9.2% rise in casino revenues as well. In fact, revenues in the region have been mostly strong over the past few months.3.    Melco Resorts’ third-quarter earnings of 31 cents per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 23 cents by 34.8% Also, the bottom line increased significantly from the prior-year quarter’s figure of 13 cents, owing to higher revenues.Notably, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s net revenues of $1.38 billion surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.29 billion by nearly 4% and also increased 19.5% on a year-over-year basis. This improvement in the top line was primarily driven by higher rolling chip revenues at City of Dreams and the initiation of rolling chip operations at Studio City in November 2016. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Adjusted Property EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, and amortization) was $400.2 million in the quarter under review, up 38.4% year over year. The upside was prompted by improved performance in the group-wide rolling chip segment (read more: Melco Resorts’ Stock Falls Despite Q3 Earnings Beat.  4.    Eldorado Resorts posted third-quarter 2017 earnings of 36 cents, which topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 32 cents by 12.5%. However, net revenues of $444.9 million decreased 1% year over year and lagged the consensus estimate by over 1%. The year-over-year decline in this Zacks Rank #3 company’s results reflects the decline in revenues at the Midwest, the South and the East segments, partially offset by a rise in the West segment.Price PerformanceThe following table shows the price movement of the major gambling stocks over the past week and the last six months:CompanyLast Week Last 6 MonthsWYNN6.3%24.9%LVS7.2%15.1%MGM2.3%2.8%MLCO9.6%20.8%MCRI3.9%51.7%PENN2.4%39.9%BYD2%19.4%Over the last five trading sessions, share price movement of the major gambling stocks was positive.

1747,WYNN,"Things are looking up for Casino stocks and ETFs. A Nomura report indicated ""a noticeable pickup in demand"" in Macau's VIP and mass-market gaming revenues in the last 10 days of October, as quoted on CNBC.com. Notably, Macau registered 16.1% year-over-year growth in casino gross gaming revenues in September.Based on the latest upbeat trend, Nomura upped its Macau gross gaming revenue estimate to reflect a year-over-year rise of 19-21% for October. This is way higher than the consensus forecast of 15.9% as well as the historical October trend (as followed by Nomura) of 13-14% year-over-year growth.  The time is so important because, the start of October marks the ""Golden Week"" with China’s National Day falling on Oct 1. People go for vacations to Macau and other destinations during this time, as per the CNBC article (read: Follow These ETFs as China's 19th National Congress Begins).If this isn’t enough, latest earnings from two industry bellwethers came in favorable. Inside Earnings Wynn Resorts Ltd. (WYNN  -  Free Report) posted solid results for third-quarter 2017, with earnings and revenues beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Wynn Macau revenues increased 15.3% year over year owing to higher casino revenues while casino revenues from Macau operations jumped 16.2%.Las Vegas Sands Corp. (LVS  -  Free Report) reported better-than-expected third-quarter 2017 results with both earnings and revenues beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Per management, this solid performance was primarily owing to a full quarter of operations for The Parisian Macao and stronger results at Marina Bay Sands in Singapore. However, net revenues from Las Vegas operations were down 1.6% year over year, owing to a 9% decline in casino revenues.This means that despite all worries about the crackdown on illegal money transfer and economic slowdown, the mecca of casino gaming is returning to life.Market Impact Thanks to Nomura’s upbeat report, casino stocks moved northward. Las Vegas Sands gained 3.1%, Wynn Resorts added 4.5% and MGM Resorts International(MGM) ticked up 2.6% on Oct 31. Overall positive sentiment can surely be felt for the pure-play ETF VanEck Vectors Gaming ETF (BJK  -  Free Report) which added 1.8% on Oct 31.In any case, the Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 32%. The fund has a sizable exposure to the afore-mentioned stocks. While investing in a single stock is always an option, investors can take advantage of the recovery in Macau and reassuring earnings via BJK or the basket approach.BJK in FocusThe fund looks to track the MVIS Global Gaming Index and provides investors direct exposure to the casino gaming market. The fund has so far attracted $23.4 million in assets and invested that in 40 holdings. The product is expensive as its net expense ratio is 67 bps.All the three abovementioned companies have created places in the top 10 holdings of the fund with a considerable share. Both companies, Las Vegas Sands and Sands China, have about 15% exposure in BJK. MGM Resorts International and  MGM China Holdings call for about 8% of the fund. Wynn Resorts Ltd and Wynn Macau also account for about 8% of BJK. The fund has about 38.4% exposure to the United States followed by 14.7% in China and 14.1% in Australia (see all Consumer Discretionary ETFs here).Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?

1748,WYNN,"Sony Corporation (SNE  -  Free Report) reported second-quarter fiscal 2017 earnings per share of ¥101.35 (90 cents), which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 54 cents by a whopping 66.7%.Also, earnings grew a colossal 2600% from the year-ago quarter figure of ¥3.76, thanks to robust revenue growth.Inside the HeadlinesSony’s sales and operating revenues were up an impressive 22.1% year over year to ¥2,062.5 billion ($18.3 billion). Solid growth in the Game and Network Services segment and positive effect of foreign currency translation spurred top-line growth. Sony witnessed spectacular performance across its segments.Additionally, operating income came in at ¥204.2 million ($1,807 million), up a whopping 346.4% from the year-ago quarter. Robust improvement in the operating results of the Semiconductors and G&NS segments proved conducive to operating income. Further, the results of the year-ago quarter were adversely affected by inventory write-downs, charges due to the Kumamoto earthquake and also impairment charges related to the transfer of the battery business, which contributed to the favorable year-over-year comparison.Sony Corp Ord Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Sony Corp Ord Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Sony Corp Ord QuoteSemiconductors sales and operating revenues jumped 17.9% year over year to ¥228.4 billion ($2.1 billion). Strong sales of image sensors for mobile products and absence of the impact of lower image sensor production due to the Kumamoto earthquakes bolstered sales of this segment.Financial Services revenues were up 7.2%, year over year, to ¥279.2 billion ($2.5 billion). Healthy investment performance of the “separate account” at Sony Life proved conducive to sales growth of this segment. Higher insurance premiums revenue also drove this segment’s top line.Moreover, sales and operating revenues of the Imaging Products & Solutions (“IP&S”) segment climbed 15.8% year over year to ¥156.7 billion ($1.4 billion). Absence of impact from the Kumamoto earthquakes and favorable foreign currency movements acted as a catalyst for the IP&S segment.The Music segment experienced a 37.5% increase in sales to ¥206.6 billion ($1.9 billion) on a year-over-year basis. It benefited from elevated Visual Media and Platform sales, driven by “Fate/Grand Order” application. Also, Recorded Music sales grew supported by a steady rise in digital streaming revenues.The Home Entertainment & Sound (“HE&S”) segment sales and operating revenues came in at ¥300.9 billion ($2.7 billion), up a striking 28.1% on a year-over-year basis. The top-line rise came on the back of improvement in product mix reflecting a shift to high value-added models, as well as favorable foreign currency movements.Sales and operating revenues from the Pictures segment were up 27% year over year to ¥244 billion ($2.2 billion). Higher sales in Motion Pictures and Media Networks drove the overall growth. While strong worldwide theatrical performance of “Spider-Man: Homecoming” drove Motion Pictures sales, robust advertising and subscription revenues in India boosted Media Networks sales.Sales and operating revenues at the Game & Network Services (“GN&S”) segment climbed an impressive 35.4% year over year to ¥433.2 billion ($3.9 billion). Improvements in the PS4 software sales (including sales through the network), impressive sales of PS4 hardware and favorable foreign currency movements proved conducive to increase in sales.Mobile Communications (“MC”) sales inched up 1.9% year on year to ¥172 billion ($1.5 billion) due to an increase in sales of the fixed-line communications business, which was substantially offset by lower unit sales of smartphones.Liquidity & Cash FlowAs of Sep 30, 2017, Sony’s cash and cash equivalents were ¥1000.8 million ($9 million) compared with ¥960.1 billion recorded on Mar 31, 2017.Long-term debt totaled ¥587.8 million ($5.3 million) compared with ¥681.5 million as of Mar 31, 2017.AcquisitionDuring the quarter, Sony's operating arm, Pictures Television Networks, signed an agreement to acquire a substantial majority stake in Japanese anime distributor, Funimation Productions, Ltd. The closing of the transaction, valued at $150 million, is subject to regulatory approvals and certain other conditions.Funimation licenses and distributes Japanese anime content in the United States and operates the subscription streaming service FunimationNOW, available via PlayStation Store, iTunes Store, Google Play, Amazon Apps, Xbox Store and mobile devices. Funimation has enjoyed a solid growth trajectory since 2011. Sony believes this acquisition will help it deliver the best anime to fans across all screens and platform.GuidanceConcurrent with the fiscal second-quarter results, Sony revised its revenue guidance for fiscal 2017 upward once again. Currently, the company expects total sales to be around ¥8,500, up 2.4% from the earlier figure of ¥8,300. The upward revision is largely attributable to changes in the expected impact of foreign exchange rates, as well as higher sales in Music and HE&S segments.The company also raised its operating income guidance and now expects it to be around ¥630 billion (earlier projection: ¥500 billion), a jump of 118.2% from fiscal 2016. Improvements in operating income are anticipated to be driven by growth in Semiconductors Music and HE&S segments.Per segments, four of the company’s divisions, namely GN&S, Music, Semiconductors and HE&S, are estimated to garner higher revenues than previously expected in August.Overall, the GN&S segment is anticipated to benefit from an expected increase in PS4 hardware sales as well as network sales, while Music sales are predicted to be driven by higher-than-expected Visual Media and Platform sales as well as Recorded Music sales. Image sensor unit sales for mobile products will likely drive Semiconductors sales higher, while an expected increase in television unit sales will benefit HE&S revenues.The forecasts for sales and operating income for the IP&S, Pictures and Financial Services segments remain unchanged from the August forecast. On the other hand, MC sales are forecast to be lower than earlier expected due to an expected decrease in smartphone unit sales.Our TakeSony’s first-half of fiscal 2017 was impressive, with spectacular top- and bottom-line growth and impressive numbers. The lingering effects of the Kumamoto earthquakes, which had washed out a chunk of its profits for fiscal 2016, have subsided for the most part. Also, the impressive rebound of the Semiconductor business is a major positive and is likely to accelerate the company’s growth momentum.In addition, Sony’s focus on cost-saving initiatives, lower exposure in low-profit geographic regions, and reduction in advertising and promotion expenses are projected to drive the top line. Over the past few quarters, major restructuring efforts and internal shuffles have helped Sony optimize its business structure, thus raising profitability. This apart, we believe the company’s bolt-on acquisitions and strategic investments will help it expand its addressable markets.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderSony currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Better-ranked stocks in the same space include Nintendo Co., Ltd. (NTDOY  -  Free Report), Wynn Resorts, Limited (WYNN  -  Free Report) and GoPro, Inc. (GPRO  -  Free Report).

1749,WYNN,"Sometimes investing is wrongly lumped in with gambling. Yet when investors are armed with the most vital fundamental company information and forward-looking metrics, investing transforms into something that is hardly akin to luck-based betting.However, similar to the rush casinos offer, growth investing provides the potential for major returns. This is why many investors prefer to put their money in growth stocks instead of more value-focused plays.                              Growth investing seems to have gotten even bigger as the rapid and massive rise of tech giants like Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) and Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report) grab investors’ attention, and help spur the desire to find similar stocks with huge growth potential.One stock that offers investors the chance for major growth, accompanied by actual business segment fundamentals, is Las Vegas-based gaming giant Wynn Resorts (WYNN  -  Free Report).Growth Fundamentals Last week, Wynn beat both third-quarter earnings and revenue estimates. The casino powerhouse posted quarterly revenues of $1.61 billion and EPS of $1.52. The company’s increasingly important Macau revenues jumped 15.3% to $597.4 million, while Las Vegas operations popped almost 8% to $459.6 million (also read: Wynn Resorts (WYNN  -  Free Report) Q3 Earnings Beat on Higher Revenues).Shares of Wynn have skyrocketed over 65% since the start of the year, which crushes the S&P 500’s 13.38% growth. What’s more, the company’s stock price gained 13% in the last 12 weeks. Still, investors will be happy to know that Wynn currently sits 6% below its 52-week high, which means it has room to grow without the burden of passing through a new threshold.The casino power is poised to keep on soaring this year with growth projections that could easily send its stock price up much higher.Wynn is currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) that sports an “A” grade for both Growth and Momentum in our Style Scores system.Wynn revenues are expected to surge over 16% in the fourth quarter, based on our current consensus estimates. For the full fiscal year, the company’s revenues are set to soar 36.45% to hit $6.09 billion.Along with Wynn’s projected revenue gains, the company’s earnings are set to skyrocket almost 160% in the fourth-quarter. On top of that, Wynn’s earnings are set to climb over 50% for the full year to reach $5.13 per share.Wynn has topped earnings estimates for the trailing three quarters, posting beats of 10.95%, 8.26%, and 67.57%, respectively.Wynn Resorts, Limited Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Wynn Resorts, Limited Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Wynn Resorts, Limited QuoteFor investors focused on growth, it seems relatively clear that Wynn presents the potential for large gains over the next quarter as its top and bottom lines are projected to surge.When investors combine Wynn’s current Zacks Rank, VGM score, and earnings and revenue projections, it seems that growth-minded investors might look no further than this gambling stock that seems ready to experience more major wins down the road.Zacks’ Best Private Investment IdeasWhile we are happy to share many articles like this on the website, our best recommendations and most in-depth research are not available to the public.Starting today, for the next month, you can follow all Zacks' private buys and sells in real time.

1750,WYNN,"The U.S. gaming industry has been on a strong growth trajectory for over a year now. According to our Zacks Industry Rank, the Gaming industry has gained more than 32.9% in the past year, outpacing the S&P 500’s 23.8%.Within the gaming space, the casino market, which is considered one of the largest entertainment markets in the world, is positioned for substantial growth over the long haul. Per a report by Research and Markets, the casino gaming market in the United States is expected to see a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.74% in the 2017-2021 period.What’s Working in Favor of Casinos?The stellar rally of casino stocks on the bourses has been supported by an array of factors. First, demand in the casino space is relatively inelastic as the business targets a fixed range of consumers. These consumers will continue to demand services at casinos irrespective of market conditions. Moreover, a rising middle-class population with increased spending on leisure is helping the gambling market flourish.Second, lenient government regulations with respect to online casinos have led to a rapid rise of casino operators. Online gambling has been a primary growth driver for the market as a wide range of customers has gained access to such portals.Finally, improving dynamics of the tourism industry is favoring casino companies. Tourism in Las Vegas is looking up on a consistent increase in traffic. Revenues at companies operating in Las Vegas are also likely to grow.Moreover, the turnaround in Macau business is helping the companies rake in handsome profits. Although a tough operating environment in Macau weighed on casino stocks from June 2014 to most part of 2016, revenues have been rising since the second half of 2016 with new resorts attracting high rollers as well as leisure gamblers.Meanwhile, efforts undertaken by Macau operators to revive revenues by attracting tourists with numerous facilities have also started yielding results. In fact, in the first 11 months of 2017, gambling revenues from Macau rose 19.5%, signaling recovery in the casino hub. Macau’s momentum has also been hitting highs lately, giving investors enough reasons to be bullish in the quarters ahead.Casino Giants Opt for Alternative Avenues Leading casino companies are primarily looking up on improving tourism in Las Vegas and increasing demand for gaming and leisure. These casinos are opting for alternative avenues to expand customer base and business. They are increasingly making associations with the hospitality sector, setting up luxury hotels alongside their gaming businesses. Since these non-gaming services generate higher margins, companies are increasingly focusing on alternative streams to drive revenues.Casino giants are also effectively responding to the rapidly evolving market and are capitalizing on significant cash flow associated with the current casino business.Picking the Right StocksWe have taken help of the Zacks Stock Screener to zero in on casino stocks that have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy) and other relevant metrics.

1751,WYNN,"The casino market, which is considered one of the largest entertainment markets in the world, is positioned for substantial growth in the long term. Per a report by Research and Markets, the casino gaming market in the United States is expected to see a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.74% in the 2017-2021 period.Leading casino companies like Wynn Resorts (WYNN  -  Free Report), Melco Resorts & Entertainment (MLCO  -  Free Report), Penn National Gaming, Inc. (PENN  -  Free Report) and Las Vegas Sands Corp. (LVS  -  Free Report) have been looking up on improving tourism in Las Vegas and increasing demand for gaming and leisure.These casinos are opting for alternative avenues to expand customer base and business. They are increasingly making associations with the hospitality sector, setting up luxury hotels alongside their gaming businesses. Since these non-gaming services generate higher margins, companies are increasingly focusing on alternative streams to drive revenues.Wynn Resorts and Melco Resorts have been responding to the rapidly evolving market and have capitalized on significant cash flow associated with the casino business. The companies, with a respective market capitalization of $16.96 billion and $13.06 billion, carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Let’s find out which stock is a better pick for now.Price PerformanceWhile both the stocks outperformed the industry’s gain of 30.9% over the past year, Wynn Resorts’ gain of 83.5% has handily outpaced Melco ‘s 57.1%.Estimated Earnings & RevenuesArguably, earnings growth is of utmost importance for determining a stock’s potential as surging profit levels indicate solid prospects (and stock price gains).For 2018, Wynn Resort’s earnings are expected to grow 24.8%. Moreover, year-over-year sales growth for the year is projected at 4.9%. Melco’s 2018 earnings and sales are likely to improve 19.8% and 2.5%, respectively. This lends Wynn Resorts an edge over Melco as well.ValuationSince casino stocks are debt-laden, it makes sense to value them based on the EV/EBITDA (Enterprise Value/ Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization) ratio. This is because the valuation metric takes into account the level of debt on a company’s balance sheet, not just its equity. For capital-intensive companies like Wynn Resorts and Melco, the EV/EBITDA is a better valuation metric because it is unaffected by changing capital structures. It also ignores the effects of noncash expenses on a company’s value.Wynn Resorts’ valuation looks a bit stretched when compared with the industry average. Looking at the company’s EV/EBITDA multiple, investors might not want to pay any further premium. The company currently has a trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA ratio of 16.6 which makes it overvalued compared with its peers as the industry current average EV/EBITDA is 13.5x. However, Melco’s valuation records 11.3x when compared with the industry. Melco is at an advantage when the companies’ valuation is considered.Return on EquityWynn Resorts delivered a return on equity (ROE) of 133% in the trailing 12 months compared with the industry’s gain of 5.9%. Melco’s ROE is pegged at 12.2%. This indicates that Wynn Resorts reinvests more efficiently than Melco.Debt Ratio Since the sector has high financial leverage, the debt-to-asset ratio comes into the picture. This measures the ability of a company to service long-term debt. Hospitality stocks should ideally have lower debt ratios, implying higher proportion of the company’s assets over the long term.We note that Wynn Resorts is in a disadvantageous position as it has high debt ratio when compared with the industry and Melco. Wynn Resorts’ debt ratio is 81.9 compared with the industry’s 48 and Melco’s 44.3x.Wynn Resorts’ heavy reliance on debt financing remains a concern. As of the last reported quarter, total debt outstanding was $10.18 billion. Owing to a higher debt burden, the company may face difficulty in financing its upcoming projects. Moreover, any downturn in the macroeconomic and credit market conditions is likely to make it difficult for the company to pay or refinance debt.Net MarginTraditionally, gross margin for hospitality companies is comparatively higher as majority of the expenses come from cost of operations. However, the sector’s profits are not very high which is evident from the net profit margin or net margin. The industry’s trailing 12-month net margin is 1.7%, while that for Wynn Resorts and Melco are 6.2% and 5.9%, respectively.While both the companies exhibit substantial cost savings to drive margins, Wynn Resorts’ solid business model lends it a competitive edge.Final ThoughtsWhile Wynn Resorts (WYNN  -  Free Report) clearly overshadows Melco (MLCO  -  Free Report) in terms of price movement, projected EPS growth, ROE and margins, the latter has an edge when it comes to valuation and debt ratio.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

1752,WYNN,"Perhaps it is because trading stocks can often mirror the thrill of winning big at the blackjack tables, or maybe it is because Las Vegas conjures images of the world’s most flashy brands and businessmen. Regardless of the reason, it is clear that gambling stocks are always among the most popular on Wall Street.Luckily for investors, now is also a great time to be buying gambling stocks, as continued Vegas strength, a great recovery in Macau, and overall international interest in gaming have led to rising share prices. What’s more, the U.S. Supreme Court just overturned a decades-long ban on sports betting, opening the door for many new legal gambling avenues soon.According to our Zacks Industry Rank data, the overall “Gaming” industry has outpaced the S&P 500 over the past year and on a year-to-date basis. With casino stocks this hot right now, investors are not going to want to miss out.Luckily, we can use Zacks’ proven stock-picking methods to find solid stocks in any industry. Check out these casino stocks today:1. Melco Resorts & Entertainment Ltd. (MLCO  -  Free Report)Melco receives the majority of its revenue from Macau, so the company has benefitted from the continued recovery in the region. Analysts are warming on MLCO, with three positive revisions to its full-year EPS estimates coming in the past 60 days. This has moved the Zacks Consensus Estimate 18 cents higher and earned the stock a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Melco is now expected to witness earnings growth of 45% in 2018. The stock is trading with a slightly-stretched P/E of 22.6, but its PEG of 1.9 implies that investors are still getting a decent price for its growth trajectory. The company’s dividend yield of 1.8% is also worth mentioning, and that could be on the cusp of improving thanks to cash flow growth of 29%. 2. Penn National Gaming, Inc. (PENN  -  Free Report)Penn National Gaming is an operator of a number of casino and gambling properties in North America, specifically located in smaller markets and non-Vegas gambling hotspots. Recently, analysts at Morgan Stanley called the Supreme Court gambling verdict as a “slight positive for regional gaming stocks” and named PENN as one that could benefit the most.Penn National is also currently holding a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). The stock has also been one of the hottest gaming picks on Wall Street recently, surging more than 30% in the past three months and nearly 64% in the last year. Still, with new growth catalysts ahead, PENN could very well break higher. 3. Las Vegas Sands Corp. (LVS  -  Free Report)With properties like the Venetian and the Parisian, Las Vegas Sands is the epitome of luxury and style in the casino industry. LVS is only sporting a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) right now, but the company has solid growth prospects and feels like a long-term play for a variety of reasons.

1755,WYNN,"Wynn Resorts, Limited (WYNN  -  Free Report) is slated to report third-quarter 2017 numbers on Oct 26, after market close. Its revenues and earnings are expected to grow year over year.Last quarter, the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings owing to a substantial improvement in revenues.Notably, Wynn Resorts has a decent earnings surprise history. The company’s trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise is a positive 11.35%.Wynn Resorts, Limited Price and EPS Surprise  Wynn Resorts, Limited Price and EPS Surprise | Wynn Resorts, Limited QuoteAlso, a look at the company’s price performance reveals that it outperformed the industry year to date. Shares of Wynn Resorts have gained around 67.5% compared with the industry’s growth of 26%.Will the stock keep rallying post third-quarter earnings release? It majorly depends on whether it is able to maintain its earnings momentum.Our proven model shows that Wynn Resorts has the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase the odds of an earnings beat in the this quarter. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at +1.94%. This is a major indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise.Zacks Rank: Wynn Resorts’ Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) when combined with a positive ESP makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Moreover, Wynn Resorts’ business activities and prospects encouraged analysts to revise earnings estimates recently. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.37 for the just-concluded quarter has moved up 9.6% over the last 30 days. Additionally, it reflects a year-over-year improvement of a solid 82.1%.Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues of $1.56 billion for the to-be-reported quarter reflects year-over-year growth of 40.6%.Factors Likely to Affect Q3 ResultsPer Macau’s Gaming Inspection and Coordination Bureau (“DICJ”), gross gaming revenues (GGR) rose in all the three months of the quarter. This, in turn, indicates that the casino hub is firmly on its path to recovery. In fact, Macau’s VIP numbers is reported to have witnessed 35% expansion in the quarter, with VIP baccarat leading the surge of casino GGR.Thus, we expect Wynn Resorts’ consistent efforts to boost tourism and traffic in Macau to bolster third-quarter performance aided by the improved operating environment therein.Particularly, the company’s full-scale integrated resort in Cotai, Wynn Palace, continues to attract visits by tourists and leisure gamblers and should thus scoop up the quarter’s revenues. Provision of better non-gaming options might further propel results in the to-be-reported quarter.Meanwhile, the company’s properties in Las Vegas are likely to continue to cash in on the positive trends of improving employment rate and increasing tourism numbers in the region, thereby boosting the quarter’s top- and bottom¬-line growth.However, stringent capital controls by the Chinese government and increased audits of the junket industry by DICJ in order to stop money laundering might have somewhat restricted gaming revenues in Macau. Also, higher promotional allowances and distribution of higher incentives in the slots as well as in the mass market to hold market share might hamper the quarter’s profitability.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some other companies to consider as our model shows they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. (TTWO  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.94% and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Penn National Gaming, Inc.

1756,WYNN,"Columbia Sportswear Company (COLM  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 26, after the markets close. While the company is expected to gain from sturdy performance in its Europe-direct business and prAna brand, results are likely to be hurt by declines across the United Sates, Latin America and Asia Pacific regions. As a result, both top and bottom lines depict a probable year-over-year decline.Let’s now have a closer look at how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Europe-Direct Business and prAna Brand to Continue Growth Columbia Sportswear has been witnessing stellar performance in its Europe-direct business for some time.  In fact, the wholesale, brick-and-mortar and e-commerce channels across the Europe-direct business have depicted sustained growth during the first-half of 2017.Owing to this trend, analysts polled by Zacks expect sales from the Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) regions to inch up 2.7% year over year to $75 million. Similarly, net sales from Canada are also expected to grow 1.3% to $76 million owing to strong performance of the company’s core brands.From a brand perspective, we note that Columbia Sportswear’s prAna brand has been attracting a large consumer base. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate of revenue for prAna brand is $38.1 million, almost in line with the prior-year figure.Headwinds Impacting Revenue Analysts polled by Zacks expect net sales from United States and Latin America and Asia Pacific (LAAP) regions to decline 2.5% and 0.9% respectively during the third quarter.Of late, the company has been facing challenges in the domestic region, especially in the wholesale front, mainly due to store closures, bankruptcies, or plans to restructure or liquidate. This has led to lower-than-expected advance orders for fall 2017 from U.S. wholesale customers.Revenues in the LAAP region have also witnessed challenges lately, owing to lower sales in Korea. There has been a general shift of consumer preference away from outdoor apparel and accessories in Korea. Also, the consensus estimate of revenues for the SOREL brand is $86 million, reflecting a year-over-year decline of 1.8%.Owing to such headwinds, analysts polled by Zacks expect total revenues of $734.9 million for the said quarter, down 1.4% from the year-ago period.These ongoing challenges are also visible in Columbia Sportswear’s share price performance. Shares of the company have underperformed the industry in the past six months. The stock has returned 4.8% compared with the industry’s gain of 10.9%.   Earnings ExpectationsThe expected decline in revenues across some of its core regions and brands has led to a bleak earnings view. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.15 for the third quarter depicts a decline of 2.7% from the year-ago period.However, estimated earnings for 2017 of $2.78 per share depict a growth of 2.2% from the year-ago figure and are in line with management’s guidance of $2.74-$2.84. Estimates for both the quarter under review as well as fiscal 2017 have remained stable over the past 30 days.We note that Columbia Sportswear has delivered an average positive surprise of 12.3% in the trailing four quarters. Notably, the company’s earnings have outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in 18 straight quarters.Columbia Sportswear Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Columbia Sportswear Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Columbia Sportswear Company QuoteWhat Does the Zacks Model Say? Our proven model does not conclusively show that Columbia Sportswear is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You may uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Although Columbia Sportswear currently carries a Zacks Rank #3, it has an Earnings ESP of -0.71%. We need to have a positive ESP to be confident about a beat.Stocks with Favorable CombinationsHere are some companies, which according to our model, have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:PVH Corp. (PVH  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.15% and carries a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Wynn Resorts Ltd.

1757,WYNN,"Las Vegas Sands Corp. (LVS  -  Free Report) is slated to report third-quarter 2017 numbers on Oct 25, after market close.Last quarter, the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings owing to an improvement in revenues.Also, Las Vegas Sands has a decent earnings surprise history. Evidently, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 10.88%.Las Vegas Sands Corp. Price and EPS Surprise  Las Vegas Sands Corp. Price and EPS Surprise | Las Vegas Sands Corp. Quote However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-quarter earnings of 67 cents reflects a year-over-year decline of nearly 7%.Also, a look at the company’s price performance shows that it underperformed the industry. Shares of Las Vegas Sands have gained around 0.4% for the three-month period (ended Sep 30, 2017), underperforming growth of 5.5% recorded by the industry.Will the upcoming earnings release give a boost to Las Vegas Sands’ stock? Well, this depends largely on whether the firm is able to post a beat in the third quarter.Our proven model shows that Las Vegas Sands has the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase the odds of an earnings beat in the third quarter. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at +3.73%. This is a major indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise.Zacks Rank: Las Vegas Sands’ Zacks Rank #3 when combined with a positive ESP makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues of $3.12 billion for the to-be-reported quarter reflects year-over-year growth of 5.1%.Factors Likely to Affect Q3 ResultsPer Macao’s Gaming Inspection and Coordination Bureau (“DICJ”), gross gaming revenues (GGR) rose in all the three months of the quarter. This, in turn, indicates that the casino hub is firmly on its path to recovery. In fact, Macao’s VIP numbers is reported to have witnessed 35% expansion in the quarter, with VIP baccarat leading the surge of casino GGR.The company’s Macao operation is thus set to experience strong growth in both the VIP segment and mass gaming revenues in the to-be-reported quarter, given the improved operating environment there.Particularly, its industry-leading Cotai Strip property portfolio in Macao is witnessing strong visitation and higher hotel occupancy rates buoyed by the addition of The Parisian Macao. In fact, the resort is expected to have continued attracting tourists and leisure gamblers, thereby boosting up revenues in the to-be-reported quarter.We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues at The Venetian Macao and Sands Cotai Central is pegged at $709 million and $461 million, reflecting a sequential rise of 3.2% and 3.6%, respectively.However, stringent capital controls by the Chinese government and increased audits of the junket industry by DICJ in order to stop money laundering might have somewhat restricted gaming revenues in Macao. Also, excess supply, especially in the Macao market, is likely to reduce Las Vegas Sands’ market share and weigh on results.Meanwhile, the company’s focus on renovation and promotion of its Las Vegas properties are likely to result in high occupancy rates, besides driving segmental performance. In fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Las Vegas Operations’ revenues is pegged at $400 million, reflecting an increase of 4.2%, on a sequential basis.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some stocks that you may want to consider as according to our model, these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Penn National Gaming, Inc.

1758,WYNN,"Wynn Resorts, Limited (WYNN  -  Free Report) had a marvelous run on the bourses in 2017, surging a whopping 94.9% compared with its industry’s gain of 43.1% and the S&P 500’s rally of 19.8%.Given its strong brand recognition and improving non-gaming revenues, coupled with expansion in the domestic market, we believe that the stock has a decent upside potential.Let’s see what the New Year holds in store for Wynn Resorts.  Strong Brand Name to Continue Offering Competitive AdvantageWynn Resorts’ strong brand name allows it to command a premium rate, relative to its peers in the gaming and lodging industry. Moreover, with a gradual revival of the U.S. economy, we expect Wynn to gain market share and grow strategically in 2018.Non-Gaming Sources to Boost RevenuesApart from the gaming business in Macau, the company has been increasingly focusing on boosting non-gaming revenues. Given the decent visitation pattern in Macau, infrastructure development and government’s efforts to boost tourism in Macau, non-gaming sources are expected to boost revenues, going forward.Wynn Resorts, Limited Revenue (TTM) Wynn Resorts, Limited Revenue (TTM) | Wynn Resorts, Limited QuoteMoreover, the company’s full-scale integrated resort in Cotai, Macau, opened in August 2016. The resort is poised to witness increased visits from tourists and leisure gamblers over the long term, which should fortify the company’s position in the Cotai strip. Notably, such projects are expected to draw business and leisure travelers, and provide a solid platform for growth. In fact, building resorts in Asia should help the company to capitalize on the strong consumer spending trend in the region.Tourism & Traffic in Macau to GrowThe government of China is considering measures to support Macau’s economy and introduce favorable policies, which is expected to improve visitation pattern, and boost tourism and traffic. These include the approval of Macau’s maritime expansion plans that are expected to aid shipping and tourism. Also, the government has enabled Mainland China cities to offer multi-entry permits. Moreover, the government has plans of going easy on the smoking ban in casinos which might thereby provide a boost to traffic and revenues.Meanwhile, Wynn Resorts too has been offering various promotional allowances and undertaking initiatives to attract gambling patrons.Expansion in Domestic Market to Reap BenefitsIn order to boost performance in Las Vegas, the company has remodeled rooms at its properties and the baccarat pit. Though tourism in Las Vegas has not yet reached the pre-recession level, it is on its way to recovery. The number of visits has been increasing every year.With an improving job scenario and stabilizing gas prices, the consumer spending environment in the domestic markets is picking up. Backed by the optimism surrounding tourism in Las Vegas and increasing visitation pattern, revenues are likely to grow.Upward Estimate Revisions for 2018Analysts have increased their 2018 estimates for the company, making the earnings picture favorable. Over the past 60 days, three estimates have gone up compared with no downward revision for the year. This trend has caused the Zacks Consensus Estimate to rise, from $6.42 a share 60 days ago to its current level of $6.68 for the year.Zacks Rank and Growth ScoreThe company has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and a Growth Score of A, indicating that it is an impressive choice for growth investors.Other PicksOther top-ranked stocks in the Zacks Consumer Discretionary sectorare Melco Resorts & Entertainment (MLCO  -  Free Report), Boyd Gaming Corporation (BYD  -  Free Report) and Hilton Worldwide Holdings (HLT  -  Free Report), each carrying a Zacks Rank of 2.

1759,WYNN,"Perhaps it is because trading stocks can often mirror the thrill of winning big at the blackjack tables, or maybe it is because Las Vegas conjures images of the world’s most flashy brands and businessmen. Regardless of the reason, it is clear that gambling stocks are always among the most popular on Wall Street.Luckily for investors, now is also a great time to be buying gambling stocks, as continued Vegas strength, a great recovery in Macau, and overall international interest in gaming have led to rising share prices. What’s more, the U.S. Supreme Court just overturned a decades-long ban on sports betting, opening the door for many new legal gambling avenues soon.According to our Zacks Industry Rank data, the overall “Gaming” industry has outpaced the S&P 500 over the past year and on a year-to-date basis. With casino stocks this hot right now, investors are not going to want to miss out.Luckily, we can use Zacks’ proven stock-picking methods to find solid stocks in any industry. Check out these casino stocks today:1. Melco Resorts & Entertainment Ltd. (MLCO  -  Free Report)Melco receives the majority of its revenue from Macau, so the company has benefitted from the continued recovery in the region. Analysts are warming on MLCO, with three positive revisions to its full-year EPS estimates coming in the past 60 days. This has moved the Zacks Consensus Estimate 18 cents higher and earned the stock a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Melco is now expected to witness earnings growth of 45% in 2018. The stock is trading with a slightly-stretched P/E of 22.6, but its PEG of 1.9 implies that investors are still getting a decent price for its growth trajectory. The company’s dividend yield of 1.8% is also worth mentioning, and that could be on the cusp of improving thanks to cash flow growth of 29%. 2. Penn National Gaming, Inc.

1760,WYNN,"American consumers are gaining confidence in the economy. Consumer confidence crushed expectations and soared to the highest level in October since 2004.  A decline in gas prices, record low jobless rate and series of highs for the stock market buoyed optimism on household finances and the economy.The economic expansion, after eight years, is finally noticeable. The U.S. economy has started to expand close to the range expected by President Trump and some other Republicans, while both manufacturing and service sectors accelerated at a record pace last month.Since Americans gained optimism on the economy, things have been looking up for consumer stocks. Stocks of consumer discretionary companies are poised to grow on the signs of renewed consumer spending strength.Confidence in American Economy Highest in 13 YearsAccording to the University of Michigan, the U.S. consumer sentiment index touched 101.1 in October, up from 95.1 in September. The key economic indicator that measure attitudes on future economic prospects reached its highest level since 2004.Americans think the economic scenario right now is “as good as it gets”. There were big gains in both the index for present economic conditions and consumer expectations. The index for current economic conditions rose to 116.4 from 111.7, while the index of consumer expectations increased to 91.3 from 84.4.Here’s how all the three major indices performed on a year-over-year (Y-Y) basis:IndexesOct 2017Oct 2016Y-Y ChangeIndex of Consumer Sentiment101.187.2+15.9%Current Economic Conditions116.4103.2+12.8%Index of Consumer Expectations91.376.8+18.9%(Source: University of Michigan)What Drove the Confidence?Household optimism was largely driven by falling gas prices, labor market health and the U.S. stock market’s record-breaking run.  The average price of a gallon dropped by 43 cents over the last five weeks after it had climbed after Hurricane Harvey impacted the Gulf Coast refinery outlets.A clearer view of last month’s labor market data, in fact, showed that keeping the effects of the hurricane aside, the U.S. employment scenario is continuing to tighten. The unemployment rate declined to 4.2%, the lowest since February 2001 and wages increased 0.5% to an average of $26.55 an hour, per the Labor Department data. In fact, in the last 12 months, hourly pay increased 2.9%, up from 2.7% in the prior month and also in line with a post-recession high.U.S. stocks, in the meanwhile, continue to extend their winning streak, with the Dow and the S&P 500 rising for five straight weeks. So, what has driven the indices higher? Investors cheered the first step toward enacting major tax reforms later this year after the Republican-controlled U.S. House of Representatives approved a 2018 budget resolution.The House of Representatives, led by Speaker Paul Ryan, passed a $4.1-trillion budget legislation that paved the way for them to rewrite the much-awaited tax code later this year. The budget aims to repeal Obamacare and also contains $1.1 trillion in non-entitlement outlays, including nearly $622 billion for defense. The far-reaching plan will trim taxes for corporates as well, which will offset the revenue loss and not add to national debt that is now above $20 trillion.Solid second-quarter earnings also provided a fillip to the U.S. equity market despite political turmoil, both at home and abroad. Meanwhile, a similar shot in the arm is expected in the third-quarter earnings season (read more: Q3 Earnings to Work Magic for Wall Street: Top 5 Picks).Why Does Consumer Confidence Matter?Such a record consumer confidence number is a significant reading since it has been, historically, good at predicting consumer spending for the next three to six months. More the confidence households generate, the more will they spend. Notably, consumer spending accounts for roughly 70% of the U.S. economy, which isn’t a petty number.These numbers influence companies’ production schedule, particularly big-ticket items like cars, appliances, etc. In fact, the consumer discretionary sector is mostly affected as spending plays a major role in determining revenues. Automobile stocks often track these numbers and so do appliance manufacturers, retailers, consumer discretionary manufacturers, big-ticket entertainment providers, jewelry retailers and cruise line operators, to name a few.5 Stocks to Gain as Consumers Gain ConfidenceSince the aforementioned sector is positioned to benefit from this stellar reading on confidence level, picking stocks from the same will be a smart move. We have, thus, selected five consumer discretionary stocks that flaunt a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). Such stocks also boast of a VGM Score of A or B. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three metrics.

1761,WYNN,"On Oct 9, we issued an updated research report on leading international developer of multi-use integrated resorts primarily operating in the United States and Asia, Las Vegas Sands Corp. (LVS  -  Free Report).Diversification – The Need of the HourWe note that diversification is the need of the hour and Las Vegas Sands is thus consistently trying to diversify its revenue sources. The company remains focused on a convention-based Integrated Resort business model that helps in generating the most diversified set of cash flows and profit from non-gaming segments while bringing unsurpassed economic and diversification benefits to the regions in which it operates. In fact, non-gaming revenues have been relatively better over the past few quarters.We also believe that properties like Sands Cotai Central and The Parisian Macao are likely to increase the company’s dominance in the Cotai strip, a region where Las Vegas Sands already has a considerable presence. The company would be able to significantly grow its retail business and meetings, incentive, convention and exhibitions (MICE) space. Both these areas of business will aid non-gaming revenues and appeal to middle-class travelers. These projects thus demonstrate the company’s commitment toward diversifying its business as these are not solely meant for gaming.Meanwhile, the company is concentrating on renovation and promotion of its Las Vegas properties in order to drive segmental performance. The improvement in employment rate and the rise in tourism numbers in the region have been boosting demand at the company’s properties in the region and are expected to continue doing so. Further, the diversification of its resort portfolio and non-gaming options is likely to contribute significantly to revenues.Macao’s Recovery & Regulatory IssuesA tough operating environment in Macao weighed on casino stocks from June 2014 to most part of 2016. However, Macao's gambling revenues have recovered and have been improving since the second half of 2016 with new resorts attracting high rollers as well as leisure gamblers. Evidently, Macao’s gaming revenues were up in September, thus marking the 14th consecutive month of gains and signaling the casino hub’s recovery.In fact, Las Vegas Sands’ Macao operations is experiencing strong growth in both its mass gaming and non-gaming segments. Also, its industry-leading Cotai Strip property portfolio in Macao is witnessing strong visitation and higher hotel occupancy rates buoyed by the addition of The Parisian Macao. The resort is expected to continue to attract tourists and leisure gamblers, thereby boosting revenues.However, the Macao government recently collaborated with the mainland authorities to tackle money laundering and terrorism financing and beefed up its anti-money laundering framework with a much wider scope and stringent compliance measures. Macao's Gaming Inspection and Coordination Bureau (DICJ) is increasing its audits of the junket industry over concerns of money laundering as well.Thus, this latest crackdown may hamper Macao’s revenue growth and reverse the 14 month streak of year-over-year gains and weigh on Las Vegas Sands’ performance.Bottom LineShares of Las Vegas Sands have jumped 15.7% in the last six months, underperforming 17.3% gain of the industry it belongs to. Even so, upward estimate revisions for the current-quarter and full-year earnings reflect analysts’ optimism about the stock’s prospects. Given the ongoing recovery in gaming revenues in Macao and continued improvement in the Las Vegas business, the stock should perform well in the quarters ahead.However, Las Vegas Sands’ The Parisian Macao along with other upcoming resorts at the Cotai Strip faces extreme peer pressure from several Chinese casino operators and other U.S.-based companies. Wynn Resorts, Limited (WYNN  -  Free Report) opened a full-scale integrated resort, Wynn Palace, on the Cotai Strip for over $4 billion in August 2016. MGM Resorts International’s (MGM  -  Free Report) $2.9 billion casino hotel is also set to open in Cotai in the fourth quarter of 2017. We believe these openings might pose a huge threat to the company’s business in the region.Nevertheless, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company is well poised for growth given a solid business model, extensive non-gaming revenue opportunities, high quality assets, attractive property locations and a fairly favorable macro environment.A better-ranked stock in this sector is Churchill Downs Incorporated (CHDN  -  Free Report) carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.For 2017, Churchill Downs’ EPS is expected to increase 22.6%.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.      Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

The move came on solid volume too with far more shares changing hands than in a normal session. This continues the recent uptrend for the company—as the stock is now up 24.2% in the past one-month time frame.The stock gained after rumored news of merger discussions of the company with rival casino operator, Penn National Gaming Inc.The company has seen three negative estimate revisions in the past few months, while its Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter has also moved lower over the past few months, suggesting there may be trouble down the road. So make sure to keep an eye on this stock going forward, to see if this recent move higher can last.Pinnacle Entertainment, Inc. Price Pinnacle Entertainment, Inc.

1763,WYNN,"The mecca of casino gaming, Macau, has finally returned to life. In fact, gaming revenues in the region grew on an annual basis in September to register 14 consecutive months of gains, following the extended slump of over two years. Notably, new resorts continue to attract high rollers as well as leisure gamblers.Meanwhile, notwithstanding the recent shooting massacre in Las Vegas, casino players’ properties therein are expected to continue to cash in on the favorable trends of an improving employment rate and positive tourism numbers. In fact, the Las Vegas Strip has been recording high occupancy rates over the past few years.Therefore, given the upbeat macro environment trends, this makes it the right time to add casino companies to your portfolio. Leading developer, owner and operator of casino resorts, Wynn Resorts, Limited (WYNN  -  Free Report) is one such stock, which is worth considering.Notably, shares of Wynn Resorts have soared 69.9% year to date compared with the industry’s growth of 28.1%. Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Wynn Resorts’ current-year earnings has moved up nearly 1%, reflecting three upward revisions versus two downward, over the last 60 days. Also, the next year’s earnings estimates have climbed 2.3% on the back of six upward revisions versus no revision in the opposite direction.In fact, all these positive earnings estimates revision testifies analysts’ unwavering confidence on the company and also substantiates its Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).This apart, Wynn Resorts continues to reflect strength in several areas and should thus make a value addition to your portfolio.Earnings & Revenue Growth: Wynn Resorts’ current-year revenues are anticipated to increase 35.1% year over year, widely outpacing the industry’s projected average growth of 1.4%.Strong top-line growth is expected to translate to an even more robust bottom-line performance. Evidently, the company’s projected EPS growth is a whopping 46.8% compared with the industry average of 18.7%.Arguably, nothing is more important than earnings growth as surging profit levels is often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) ahead for the company in question.Focus on Non-Gaming Revenues: Apart from the gaming business in Macau, the company has been increasingly focusing on boosting non-gaming revenues. Given the decent visitation pattern in Macau, infrastructure development and government’s efforts to increase tourism in Macau, non-gaming sources are anticipated to boost revenues, going forward.Additionally, Wynn Resorts’ full-scale integrated resort — Wynn Palace — opened in August 2016 in Cotai, Macau. The resort is poised to witness increased visits from tourists and leisure gamblers over the long term, which should fortify the company’s position in the Cotai strip. Notably, such projects are expected to draw business and leisure travelers, and provide a solid platform for growth. In fact, building resorts in Asia is expected to help the company capitalize on the strong consumer spending trend in the region.Expansion in Domestic Market: In order to boost performance in Las Vegas, the company has remodeled rooms at its properties and the baccarat pit. Also, Wynn Resorts’ casino resort that is anticipated to open in Massachusetts in 2019 is likely to strengthen its presence in the U.S. market. Further, it plans to start building Wynn Paradise Park by year-end or early 2018, taking over a footprint that includes the Wynn Golf Club comprising restaurants, hotels and other entertainment options. Backed by the optimism surrounding tourism in Las Vegas and increasing visitation pattern, the company’s revenues are likely to grow as well.Favorable ROE: Wynn Resorts delivered return on equity (ROE) of a whopping 165.8% in the trailing 12 months compared with the industry’s gain of 7.5%. This supports its growth potential and indicates that the company reinvests more efficiently compared with its peers.Bottom LineWynn Palace is likely to face extreme peer pressure from several local Chinese casino operators as well as the The Parisian Macao (opened in September 2016) and the Sands Cotai Central project of Las Vegas Sands Corp. (LVS  -  Free Report). Another US-based company, MGM Resorts International’s (MGM  -  Free Report) $2.9 billion casino hotel is also set to open in Cotai in the fourth quarter of 2017. We believe these openings might pose a huge threat to the company’s business in the region in the future.Nevertheless, given the company’s solid fundamentals, strong brand recognition, increasing market share, focus on non-gaming revenues and a fairly favorable macro environment, the stock should keep performing well in the quarters ahead, thus making it a top investment choice.Another stock worth considering in this sector is Churchill Downs Incorporated (CHDN  -  Free Report) holding the same bullish rank as Wynn Resorts. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Churchill Downs’ current-year earnings climbed nearly 1% over the last 60 days.

1764,WYNN,"Stocks of leading casino operators in Las Vegas took a beating on Oct 2, after at least 59 people lost their lives and more than 500 were wounded in a mass shooting.  On Oct 1, a gunman opened fire on attendees at the Route 91 Harvest Music Festival from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino.Consequently, share price of MGM Resorts International (MGM  -  Free Report) that owns Mandalay Bay declined nearly 6% in yesterday’s trading session.Shares of Wynn Resorts Ltd. (WYNN  -  Free Report) and Boyd Gaming Corporation (BYD  -  Free Report) have also decreased 1.2% and 0.04%, respectively. Meanwhile, after initially trending down, shares of Las Vegas Sands Corp. (LVS  -  Free Report) regained most of the losses and gained 1.3%.What’s the Fuss About?The Las Vegas Strip has been recording high occupancy rates over the past year. The improvement in employment rate and rise in tourism numbers have been boosting demand at the casino companies’ properties in the region and adding to their top-line growth.Reportedly, Las Vegas’ casinos, nightclubs and shopping attract roughly 3.5 million visitors each year from around the world.Investors are thus apprehensive that tourists might choose to stay away from Las Vegas in the wake of what became the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history.Our TakeMGM Resorts owns and operates 13 resorts and casinos on the Las Vegas Strip. In fact, this casino operator has maximum U.S. exposure compared with its peers and is thus severely affected by the incident. Additionally, a potential revenue loss from its Mandalay Bay property might have an impact on the company’s fourth-quarter results.We believe the latest rampage that rattled the Strip might bring the region’s revenues under pressure and in turn hamper casino operators’ performance in the near term. Thus, we will have to wait and see what impact it has on casino companies’ properties on and around the Las Vegas Strip.While Wynn Resorts currently holds a Zacks Ranks #2 (Buy), MGM Resorts, Boyd Gaming and Las Vegas Sands carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1765,WYNN,"Late Sunday evening, the Route 91 Harvest Music Festival was going strong, with country artist Jason Aldean headlining for a crowd of about 22,000 concertgoers. But all of a sudden, bullets began raining down, and chaos ensued: a lone gunman, situated on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino, had opened fire on attendees.58 people have been killed so far, and 515 injured, making this the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history (Updated).Police say the suspected shooter, Stephen Craig Paddock, had at least 10 weapons with him inside the hotel room. While motive is unclear at this point, authorities do believe Paddock killed himself prior to police entry.Flights in and out of Las Vegas’ McCarran International Airport were temporarily halted because of the shooting, and agents for the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives have responded to the scene; the FBI, too, is assisting with the investigation.Monday morning saw shares of some of the biggest casino stocks react to the news.

1766,WYNN,"On Sep 8, we issued an updated research report on leading developer, owner and operator of casino resorts, Wynn Resorts, Limited (WYNN  -  Free Report).Though the company has solid long-term growth potential but the risks from near-term headwinds might somewhat restrict its growth momentum.Key Growth DriversWynn Resorts generates a solid share of its revenues from Macau resorts. Apart from the gaming business in Macau, the company has been increasingly focusing on boosting non-gaming revenues. Given the decent visitation pattern therein, infrastructure development and government’s efforts to boost tourism, non-gaming sources are expected to boost revenues, going forward.In fact, building resorts in Asia might help the company to capitalize on the strong consumer spending trend in the region.Meanwhile, its properties in Las Vegas are likely to continue to cash in on the favorable trends of improving employment rate and positive tourism numbers in the region.Moreover, the company’s casino resort that is expected to open in Massachusetts in 2019 is likely to strengthen its presence in the U.S. market. Moving ahead, Wynn Resorts plans to start building Wynn Paradise Park by year-end or early 2018, taking over a footprint that includes the Wynn Golf Club comprising restaurants, hotels and other entertainment options.Macau’s Recovery & Regulatory IssuesA tough operating environment in Macau weighed on casino stocks from June 2014 to most part of 2016. However, Macau's gambling revenues marked a turnaround and have been improving since the second half of 2016 with new resorts attracting high rollers as well as leisure gamblers. Evidently, Macau’s gaming revenues were up in August, thus marking the 13th consecutive month of gains and signaling the casino hub’s recovery.We thus note that the opening of Wynn Palace (in August 2016) has been a major reason for the turnaround in gambling revenues in Macau  as it attracted visits from tourists and leisure gamblers. Moreover, the resort is poised to fortify the company’s position in the Cotai strip over the long term.However, continual construction around Wynn Palace has been hampering foot traffic therein, of late. Therefore, the company failed to fully capitalize on the rebound in Macau gaming revenues given somewhat lower-than-expected results at Wynn palace in the second quarter.Furthermore, the Macau government recently joined hands with the mainland authorities to tackle money laundering and terrorism financing and beefed up its anti-money laundering framework with a much wider scope and stringent compliance measures. Macau's Gaming Inspection and Coordination Bureau (DICJ) is increasing its audits of the junket industry, over worries of money laundering as well.Thus, this latest crackdown may hamper Macau’s revenue growth and reverse the 13 month streak of year-over-year gains, thus somewhat weighing down on Wynn Resorts’ performance.Bottom LineShares of Wynn Resorts’ have rallied 47.2% in the last six months, outperforming 24% gain of the industry it belongs to. Given the ongoing recovery in gaming revenues in Macau and continued improvement in the Las Vegas business, the stock is likely to perform well in the quarters ahead.Additionally, earnings estimates for current quarter and year have moved up 2.5% and 4.4%, respectively, over the past 60 days. This reflects ongoing optimism in the stock.However, Wynn Palace is likely to face extreme peer pressure from several local Chinese casino operators as well as the The Parisian Macao (opened in September 2016) and the Sands Cotai Central project of Las Vegas Sands Corp. (LVS  -  Free Report). Another US-based company, MGM Resorts International’s (MGM  -  Free Report) $2.9 billion casino hotel is also set to open in Cotai in the fourth quarter of 2017. We believe these openings might pose a huge threat to the company’s business in the region in the future.Nevertheless, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company is well poised for growth given its solid fundamentals, strong brand recognition, increasing market share, focus on non-gaming revenues and a fairly favorable macro environment.A better-ranked stock in this sector is Melco Resorts & Entertainment Limited (MLCO  -  Free Report) holding a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

1767,WYNN,"On Aug 31, we issued an updated research report on global hospitality company MGM Resorts International (MGM  -  Free Report).Though the company has solid long-term growth potential but the risks from near-term headwinds might somewhat restrict its growth momentum.Domestic VenturesMGM Resorts’ Las Vegas business is doing well on the back of the ongoing economic recovery and growing tourism in the region. It is expected to continue growing over the long term, driven by a strong convention calendar and the completion of several capital initiatives on the Las Vegas Strip.Notably, the acquisition of full ownership of Borgata Hotel Casino & Spa — Atlantic City’s top casino — complements MGM Resorts’ increasing presence in the Northeastern United States and should continue to drive top-line growth.Meanwhile, MGM National Harbor, a casino resort that opened in December 2016 is off to a great start. Another casino resort in Western Massachusetts is set to be developed on roughly 14 acres of land in downtown Springfield, MA, the construction of which is slated to be completed in late 2018. Both these resorts include a number of gaming as well as non-gaming amenities.Thus, the company is expected to witness increased occupancy and better pricing in the domestic markets as a result of these efforts and openings. This, in turn, should drive incremental revenues at the company’s properties in the region. Moreover, these projects demonstrate this Las Vegas, NV-based company’s commitment toward diversifying its business.Macau’s Recovery & Regulatory IssuesA tough operating environment in Macau weighed on casino stocks from June 2014 to most part of 2016. However, Macau's gambling revenues marked a turnaround and have been rising since the second half of 2016 with new resorts attracting high rollers as well as leisure gamblers. In fact, Macau’s gaming revenues were up in July, thus marking the 12th consecutive month of gains and signaling the casino hub’s recovery.Markedly, after been mostly weak for the last two years, the VIP business in Macau has started to recover. Meanwhile, the main floor gaming has also been mostly faring well in the recent times. Additionally, MGM China is undertaking initiatives to increase revenues and junket productivity in Macau as it anticipates a positive trend buoyed by upgrades to main gaming floor products and marketing initiatives. MGM Cotai’s construction too is in the final stages and is expected to boost revenues when it opens in the fourth quarter of 2017.Thus, though it seems that the worst is over for Macau’s gambling industry, it will still take some time for the company to fully capitalize on the rebound in Macau gaming revenues. This is evident from the company’s weak results at MGM China in the second quarter. Notably, revenues declined 1% in the quarter due to lower revenues from main-floor table games.  However, the Macau government recently joined hands with the mainland authorities to tackle money laundering and terrorism financing and beefed up its anti-money laundering framework with a much wider scope and stringent compliance measures. Macau's Gaming Inspection and Coordination Bureau (DICJ) is increasing its audits of the junket industry, over worries of money laundering as well.Thus, this latest crackdown may hamper Macau’s revenue growth and reverse the 12 month streak of year-over-year gains, thus weighing down on MGM Resorts’ performance.Bottom LineMGM Resorts’ Profit Growth Plan continues to bear fruit as being reflected in improving profits. Evidently, the second quarter of 2017 marked the ninth consecutive quarter of double-digit EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, and amortization) growth at the company.Nevertheless, the company faces stiff competition in the markets of Las Vegas and Macau due to increased hotel openings and promotional activities. In fact, the company’s upcoming project in the Cotai Strip is expected to face competition from several Chinese casino operators and the Sands Cotai Central project of Las Vegas Sands Corp. (LVS  -  Free Report). Wynn Resorts Ltd. (WYNN  -  Free Report) also opened a full-scale integrated resort, Wynn Palace, on the Cotai Strip in August 2016.Despite the headwinds, we note that MGM Resorts’ shares have rallied 19.4% in the last six months, outperforming 15% gain of the industry it belongs to.Given the company’s strong fundamentals, superior business model, extensive non-gaming revenue opportunities, high quality assets and attractive property locations, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock is likely to keep performing well in the quarters ahead.A better-ranked stock in this sector is Melco Resorts & Entertainment Limited (MLCO  -  Free Report), sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Melco Resorts’ full-year 2017 earnings climbed 8.6% over the last 60 days.

1768,WYNN,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Wynn Resorts, Limited (WYNN  -  Free Report). Shares have added about 2% in that time frame, outperforming the market.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Wynn Resorts Q2 Earnings & Revenues Top EstimatesWynn Resorts posted solid results for second-quarter 2017, with earnings and revenues beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Earnings and Revenues DiscussionAdjusted earnings of $1.18 per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.09 by 8.3%. Further, earnings increased 10.3% from the year-ago figure of $1.07, given a substantial rise in revenues.Wynn Resorts’ revenues of $1.53 billion topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.45 billion by 5.3%. Moreover, revenues increased 44.5% given significant contribution from Wynn Palace along with favorable performance by the company’s Las Vegas Operations and higher revenues from Wynn Macau.Adjusted property earnings before interests, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) surged 37.5% to $430 million year over year on higher revenues.Meanwhile, total operating costs and expenses increased 40.8% to around $1.28 billion, primarily owing to a rise in casino, rooms, food and beverage, entertainment, retail and other as well as general and administrative expenses.Macau OperationsWynn Resorts reports its Macau table games results under two segments – VIP and mass market.Wynn MacauWynn Macau revenues increased 6.8% year over year to $682.7 million in the quarter owing to higher casino revenues, somewhat offset by lower non-casino revenues.Notably, casino revenues from Macau operations jumped 7.4% to $654.7 million. Meanwhile, table games turnover in the VIP segment soared 35.3% to $16.02 billion. However, the VIP table games win rate (based on turnover) was 3.53%, down 45 basis points (bps) year over year but above the projected range of 2.7% to 3%.Table drop in the mass market segment was $1.07 billion, down 9%. Table games win in the mass market category amounted to $221.6 million, down 5.8%. Nevertheless, mass market win rate was 20.8%, up 80 bps.Non-casino revenues before promotional allowances tanked 10.8% to $60.8 million. Meanwhile, room revenues decreased 12.4% to $25.7 million. Revenue per available room (RevPAR) plunged 14.3% in the quarter to $252 million as average daily rate (ADR) declined 19.6%. But occupancy rate increased 600 bps to 97.5%.In the quarter, adjusted property EBITDA was $210.4 million, up 10.5% year over year.Wynn PalaceOn Aug 22, 2016, Wynn Resorts’ chairman of the board and chief executive officer, Steve Wynn, unveiled the Wynn Palace resort in the Cotai area of Macau. Thus, the second quarter of 2017 represents the third full quarter of operations for this resort.Wynn Resorts’ revenues from Wynn Palace were $414.7 million in the quarter, while casino revenues totaled to $372.2 million.While table games turnover in the VIP segment was nearly $11.60 billion, VIP table games win rate (based on turnover) was 2.18%, below the expected range of 2.7–3%.Notably, table drop in the mass market segment was $729 million. Meanwhile, table games win in mass market operations amounted to $168.7 million and mass market win rate was 23.1%.Non-casino revenues, before promotional allowances were $79.5 million. During the quarter, room revenues were $35.4 million with an ADR of $232 million, occupancy of 96.2% and REVPAR of $224 million. In the quarter, adjusted property EBITDA stood at $87.4 million.Though Wynn Palace is poised to witness increased visits from tourists and leisure gamblers over the long term, foot traffic has been low of late due to construction around the resort. As a result, the company failed to fully capitalize on the rebound in Macau gaming revenues, in the quarter.Las Vegas OperationsWynn Resorts’ revenues from Las Vegas operations were up 3.1% to $431.9 million on the back of higher casino and non-casino revenues. Notably, casino revenues from Las Vegas operations inched up 4.8% to $139.3 million.

Room revenues were up 1.4% to $115.1 million. During the quarter, RevPAR grew 1.9% to $268 million on the back of a 340 bps increase in occupancy rate and a 1.9% rise in ADR. While food and beverage revenues increased 4% to $160.1 million, entertainment, retail and other revenues decreased 4.9% to $57 million. Adjusted property EBITDA was up 8.1% to $132.2 million.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then? Following the release, investors have witnessed an upward trend in fresh estimates.

1769,WYNN,"Wynn Resorts, Limited (WYNN  -  Free Report) was a big mover last session, as the company saw its shares rise more than 6% on the day. The move came on solid volume too with far more shares changing hands than in a normal session. This stock, which remained volatile and traded within the range of $125.63 – $138.98 in the past one-month time frame, witnessed a sharp increase yesterday.The move came after analysts at Deutsche Bank apparently upgraded the stock to a buy from a hold and raised its target price.The company has seen two positive estimate revisions in the past few weeks, while its Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter has also moved higher over the past few weeks, suggesting that more solid trading could be ahead for Wynn Resorts. So make sure to keep an eye on this stock going forward to see if this recent jump can turn into more strength down the road.Wynn Resorts currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) while its Earnings ESP is positive.Wynn Resorts, Limited Price and Consensus Wynn Resorts, Limited Price and Consensus | Wynn Resorts, Limited QuoteA better-ranked stock in the Gaming industry is Melco Crown Entertainment Limited (MLCO  -  Free Report) which carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

1770,WYNN,"Shares of some casino industry powerhouses fell across the board on Thursday, many of which have ties to Macau, the world’s newest gambling Mecca. However, with tensions surrounding North Korea escalating, the hotspot’s close proximity to the tumultuous region might possibly hurt stock prices.Lower travel numbers could spark trouble for U.S.-based companies that now operate in Macau. The area’s success has helped the gaming industry gain over 21% year-to-date, outpacing the S&P 500 by almost double, according to our Zacks Industry Rank data.Shares of Melco Crown Entertainment (MLCO  -  Free Report), which receives the majority of its revenue from Macau, fell 2.22% on Thursday. Las Vegas Sands (LVS  -  Free Report) also has a presence in the region, and the company’s stock price fell 1.07%.Wynn Resorts, Limited (WYNN  -  Free Report) and MGM Resorts International (MGM  -  Free Report), both of which own casinos in Asia’s gambling capital, sank by around 3%.June travel to Macau rose 0.86% year-over-year according to an Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation report. Mainland Chinese visitor rates to the gambling destination increased by 0.8%. But travel from nearby Hong Kong fell by 3.9%, and Taiwanese tourism dropped by 9.9%.The report cited expensive transportation costs and pricey accommodation as possible reasons for June’s slowdown in tourism.But it seems for now casinos can breathe easy if June numbers hold, as visitor rates weren’t down across the board. The number of overnight visitors to Macau grew for the 23rd month in a row.Japanese tourism increased by 13.5% and South Korean numbers skyrocket by 42.2% according to the OCBC report. However, June was a long time ago in terms of the geopolitical climate. If the North Korea situation keeps getting worse, which seems like a strong possibility, travel to Macau could slow and in turn help bust some casino stocks.Investors should keep a close eye on these numbers from Japan and South Korea, two U.S. allies that have a lot at stake in the current climate. If tensions continue to increase, fear could keep tourists at home.One Simple Trading IdeaSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.

1771,WYNN,"The second-quarter earnings season has crossed the halfway mark. We notice that the Consumer Discretionary sector has, so far, outpaced most other sectors in terms of top-line growth and delivered strong bottom-line growth as well.Per the latest Earnings Preview, 42.9% of the Consumer Discretionary companies in the S&P 500 index have already reported their results as of Jul 28. Growth rate for earnings and revenues is 11.4% and 13.3%, respectively. Moreover, the beat ratios for the sector have been remarkable (66.7% for earnings and 53.3% for revenues).Coming to the leisure companies from the Consumer Discretionary sector, we note that their performance has mostly good so far this earnings season as they usually see an uptick during the spring and summer seasons.Among the leisure stocks that have already reported results, Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc. (HLT  -  Free Report), Las Vegas Sands Corp. (LVS  -  Free Report) and Wynn Resorts, Inc. (WYNN  -  Free Report) delivered an impressive performance with earnings and revenues topping the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Meanwhile, Melco Crown Entertainment Limited (MLCO  -  Free Report) and Penn National Gaming, Inc.’s(PENN  -  Free Report) results were a mixed bag. While their respective earnings missed the consensus mark, revenues topped the same.Three leisure stocks from the sector are set to report their second-quarter 2017 results on Aug 2. Will these companies manage to put up a decent performance? Let’s take a look at what might be in store for them this quarter:Choice Hotels International Inc. (CHH  -  Free Report) delivered a positive earnings surprise of 4.08% in the last quarter. In fact, it has surpassed estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, recording an average positive surprise of 5.02%.Notably, our proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for Choice Hotels in the quarter. This is because a company needs to have the right combination of the two key ingredients – a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better – to increase its odds of an earnings surprise, which is not the case here.For the second quarter, the company has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter’s earnings is pegged at 77 cents.Choice Hotels International, Inc.

(HGV  -  Free Report) came up with a positive earnings surprise of 34.21% in the last quarter.However, the company is unlikely to post a beat in second-quarter 2017 due to the combination of its Earnings ESP of 0.00% and Zacks Rank #3.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter’s earnings is pegged at 45 cents.Hilton Grand Vacations Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Hilton Grand Vacations Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Hilton Grand Vacations Inc. QuoteMeanwhile, Zynga, Inc.  posted in-line earnings in the last quarter.

You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter is pegged at break-even earnings.Although Zynga has been witnessing slow user growth for a while, we expect franchises like Words With Friends and Zynga Poker as well as new games like CSR 2, FarmVille: Tropic Escape and Dawn of Titans to drive its top line in the to-be-reported quarter (read more: Zynga to Report Q2 Earnings: Is a Surprise in Store?).Zynga Inc.

1772,WYNN,"Sony Corporation (SNE  -  Free Report) reported first-quarter fiscal 2017 earnings per share of ¥62.70 (56 cents), which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 48 cents by 16.7%.Also, earnings grew a massive 281.4% from the year-ago quarter figure, thanks to decent revenue growth.Inside the HeadlinesSony’s sales and operating revenues were up an impressive 15.2% year over year to ¥1,858.1 billion ($16.6 billion). Solid top-line rise in seven of the company’s eight segments drove the quarterly sales improvement. Especially, the spectacular performance of Financial Services and Semiconductors segment acted as major catalysts.Additionally, operating income came in at ¥157.6 million ($1,407 million), up a whopping 180.5% from the year-ago quarter. Robust improvement in the operating results of the Semiconductors and Imaging Products & Solutions (“IP&S”) segments proved conducive to an increase in operating income.Semiconductors sales and operating revenues jumped 41.4% year over year to ¥204.3 billion ($1.8 billion). Strong sales of image sensors for mobile products and absence of the impacts of Kumamoto earthquakes boosted sales of this segment.Financial Services revenues were up 30.3%, year over year to ¥303.2 billion ($2.7 billion). Healthy investment performance of the “separate account” at Sony Life proved conducive to sales growth of this segment. Impressive rally of the Japanese stock market drove the investment performance in the separate account.Moreover, sales and operating revenues of the Imaging Products & Solutions (“IP&S”) segment climbed 27.3% year over year to ¥155.6 billion ($1.4 billion). Increase in unit sales and an improvement in product mix (on account of a shift to high value-added models in Still and Video Cameras) acted as tailwinds for the IP&S unit. Also, absence of impact from the Kumamoto earthquakes acted as a catalyst.The Music segment experienced an 18.8% increase in sales to ¥168.6 billion ($1.5 billion) on a year-over-year basis. It benefited from higher visual media and platform sales. Also, Recorded Music sales grew supported by healthy sales of albums. These include The Chainsmokers’ Memories...Do Not Open and Harry Styles’ self-titled album.The Home Entertainment & Sound (“HE&S”) segment sales and operating revenues came in at ¥256.9 billion ($2.3 million), up 8.9% on a year-over-year basis. The top-line rise came on the back of improvement in product mix reflecting a shift to high value-added models.Sales and operating revenues form the Pictures Segment were up 12.3% year over year to ¥205.8 billion ($1.8 billion). Higher sales in Television Productions and Media Networks more than offset the revenue decline in Motion Pictures, thus driving overall growth. While higher licensing revenues for U.S. television series – including The Last Tycoon and Better Call Saul – drove Televisions Production sales, robust advertising revenues in India boosted Media Networks sales.Sales and operating revenues at the Game & Network Services (“GN&S”) segment climbed 5.4% year over year to ¥348.1 billion ($3.1 billion). Improvements in the PS4 software sales (including sales through the network) and impressive market traction of PlayStationVR proved conducive to increase in sales. However, price slash of PS4 hardware hindered this segment’s growth to some extent.Mobile Communications (“MC”) sales edged down 2.5% year on year to ¥181.2 billion ($1.6 billion) due to change in product mix of smartphones.Sony Corp Ord Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Sony Corp Ord Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Sony Corp Ord QuoteLiquidity & Cash FlowAs of Jun 30, 2017, Sony’s cash and cash equivalents were ¥984.2 million ($8.8 million) compared with ¥631.4 billion recorded at the end of Jun 30, 2016.Long-term debt totaled ¥601.5 million ($5.4 million) compared with ¥681.5 million as of Mar 31, 2016.AcquisitionConcurrent with the earnings release, Sony's operating arm, Pictures Television Networks, signed an agreement to acquire a substantial majority stake in Japanese anime distributor, Funimation Productions, Ltd., (""Funimation""). The closing of the transaction, which is valued at $150 million, is subject to regulatory approvals and certain other conditions.Funimation licenses and distributes Japanese anime content in the U.S., and operates the subscription streaming service FunimationNOW, available via PlayStation Store, iTunes Store, Google Play, Amazon Apps, Xbox Store and mobile devices. Funimation has enjoyed a solid growth trajectory since 2011. Sony believes this acqusition will help it deliver the best anime to fans across all screens and platform.GuidanceConcurrent with the fiscal first-quarter results, Sony revised the revenue guidance for fiscal 2017. Currently, the company expects total sales to be around ¥8,300, up 3.8% from the earlier figure of ¥8,000. The upward revision is largely attributable to lesser-than-expected impact of foreign exchange rates.The company reiterated its operating income guidance and continues to expect it to be around ¥500 billion, a jump of 73.2% from fiscal 2016. Improvements in operating income are expected to be driven by recovery of Semiconductors and Pictures segments. These forecasts assume an exchange rate of $1= ¥110.Per segments, three of the company’s divisions, namely, GN&S, IP&S and HE&S, are expected to garner higher revenues than previously expected in April. Favorable movements of foreign exchange rates are likely to supplement the top line of these segments.  Overall, the GN&S segment is anticipated to benefit from higher network sales. Improvement in the product mix, on account of a shift to high value-added models, is expected to benefit the IP&S and HE&S segments.The forecasts for sales and operating income for the MC, Pictures, Music and Financial Services segments remain unchanged from the April forecast. Sony remains confident that increase in smartphone unit sales will support growth of MC segment. Increase in media networks and television productions sales, as well as insurance premium revenues are expected to stoke growth of the Pictures and Financial Services segment respectively.However, sales of the Music segment are likely to remain flat year on year, primarily due to a decline in the physical and digital download sales in Recorded Music. In addition, the company has slashed its sales expectation for the Semiconductors segment. Lower-than-expected image sensor unit sales for mobile products are likely to play a spoilsport for the Semiconductor business.Our TakeSony entered fiscal 2017 on a cheerful note, with spectacular top- and bottom-line growths. The lingering effects of the Kumamoto earthquakes, which had washed out a chunk of its profits for fiscal 2016, have subsided to a large extent. Also, the impressive rebound of the Semiconductor business is a major positive and is likely to accelerate the company’s growth momentum. Other growth drivers include strong performances of the gaming, IP&S and HE&S segments.In addition, Sony’s focus on cost-saving initiatives, lower exposure in low-profit geographic regions, and reduction in advertising and promotion expenses are expected to drive the top line. Over the past few quarters, major restructuring efforts and internal shuffles have helped Sony optimize its business structure, thus raising profitability. This apart, we believe the company’s bolt-on acquisitions and strategic investments will help it expand its addressable markets.Other Stocks to ConsiderSony currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Better-ranked stocks in the same space include Nintendo Co., Ltd. (NTDOY  -  Free Report), H&R Block, Inc. (HRB  -  Free Report) and Wynn Resorts, Limited (WYNN  -  Free Report). While Nintendo and H&R Block sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Wynn Resorts carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Nintendo has a positive earnings surprise of 190.0%, with three consecutive beats over the trailing four quarters.With three beats in the trailing four quarters, H&R Block has a positive average surprise of 9.0%.Wynn Resorts has beat earnings twice for as many misses over the trailing four quarters and boasts an average positive surprise of 11.3%.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?  Here's another stock idea to consider.

(WYNN  -  Free Report) and Las Vegas Sands Corp. (LVS  -  Free Report) that reported better-than-expected results. Meanwhile, MGM Resorts International (MGM  -  Free Report), Melco Resorts & Entertainment Limited (MLCO  -  Free Report) and Boyd Gaming Corporation (BYD  -  Free Report) posted a mixed bag.Though MGM Resorts’ earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate, revenues missed the mark. Meanwhile, both Melco Resorts and Boyd Gaming failed to beat bottom-line expectations while their top line surpassed the same.Meanwhile, the Nevada Gaming Control Board announced an increase in revenues in the region in June.Gaming Industry 5YR % Return  Gaming Industry 5YR % ReturnRecap of the Week’s Most Important Stories  1.    Wynn Resorts posted earnings of $1.18 per share in the second quarter, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.09 by 8.3%.

The upside reflects a significant rise in revenues from the company’s Las Vegas operations, offset to an extent by weak results at MGM China.Notably, MGM China’s net revenue fell 1% year over year to $449 million due to lower revenues from main-floor table games, somewhat offset by an increase in revenues from VIP gamblers.Adjusted property EBITDA at MGM Resorts’ wholly owned domestic resorts was $658 million, up 28% year over year (read more: MGM Resorts' Q2 Earnings Beat on Higher Revenues).4.    Melco Resorts’ second-quarter earnings of 16 cents per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 20 cents by 20% However, earnings increased significantly year over year on the back of higher revenues.This Zacks Rank #2 company’s net revenue of $1.30 billion surpassed the consensus mark by almost 7%. Moreover, revenues increased 21.3% year over year primarily driven by better group-wide rolling chip revenues.Adjusted Property EBITDA was $329.5 million in the second quarter, up 34% year over year.

Moreover, the trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise is pegged at a positive 11.86%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Wynn Resorts, Limited Price and EPS Surprise  Wynn Resorts, Limited Price and EPS Surprise | Wynn Resorts, Limited QuoteFactors Likely to Affect Q2 ResultsStringent capital controls by the Chinese government and increased audits of the junket industry by Macau’s Gaming Inspection and Coordination Bureau (DICJ) in order to stop money laundering has somewhat restricted gaming revenues in Macau. Nevertheless, per the DICJ, gross gaming revenues (GGR) rose in all the three months of the quarter, thereby indicating that the casino hub is firmly on its path to recovery.Thus, we expect Wynn Resorts’ consistent efforts to boost tourism and traffic in Macau to bolster second-quarter performance aided by the improved operating environment therein.Particularly, the company’s full-scale integrated resort in Cotai, Wynn Palace, continues to attract visits by tourists and leisure gamblers, and should thus scoop up the quarter’s revenues. Provision of better non-gaming options might further propel results in the to-be-reported quarter.Meanwhile, the company’s properties in Las Vegas are likely to continue to cash in on the positive trends of improving employment rate and increasing tourism numbers in the region, thereby boosting the quarter’s top- and bottom¬-line growth.However, higher promotional allowances and distribution of higher incentives in the slots as well as in the mass market to hold market share might hamper the quarter’s profitability. In fact, second-quarter results may also be somewhat hampered as concerns related to the sustainability of revenues from the VIP market linger.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for Wynn Resorts this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Unfortunately, that is not the case here as elaborated below.Zacks ESP: Wynn Resorts has an Earnings ESP of -3.67%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is $1.05, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged higher at $1.09. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Wynn Resorts has a Zacks Rank #2, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company’s negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Notably, we caution you against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies to consider as our model shows they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Penn National Gaming, Inc. (PENN  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +8.33% and a Zacks Rank #2.

(LYV  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +31.25% and a Zacks Rank #3.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

1781,WYNN,"On Friday, shares of hotel and casino operator Wynn Resorts Ltd. (WYNN  -  Free Report) closed the day down 3.38% to $130.42 per share after one of Macau’s top prosecutor was found guilty of corruption, a sign of the Chinese government’s continued offensive on the region’s gambling district.The prosecutor, Ho Chio Meng, was sentenced to 21 years in jail after he was found guilty for illegally awarding almost 2,000 public contracts that benefited him and his family, in addition to other crimes including aggravated fraud, money laundering, and initiating or founding a criminal association.Wynn also was hit today after Daiwa analyst Jamie Soo said that one of Macau’s largest junket operators is apparently concerned about liquidity. In a note to clients, Soo wrote that the operator sent a memo to customers and staff that warned of “heightened enforcement” in relation to anti-money laundering initiatives. Wynn and its casino peers may come under pressure.""Our view of expected further heightening of enforcement continues to be reaffirmed given the events we have witnessed over the past six months. Such measures also appear to be incrementally more sweeping, and may very well have a progressive negative impact on the VIP segment in the foreseeable future. The premium mass segment may also be affected as patrons of this segment had also traditionally relied on junket-affiliated liquidity channels,” wrote Soo.Macau’s junket operators work with casinos like Wynn to bring in VIP gamers; they reach out to wealthy gamblers directly, bringing them to Macau by offering travel and accommodation promotions, for instance. However, junkets have been a large focus of China’s Macau crackdown that initially began back in 2014. President Xi Jinping promised to “clean up” the region, which is the only place in China where gambling is legal.Today’s news affected other casino stocks. Las Vegas Sands (LVS  -  Free Report) closed the day down 1.77%, while Melco Resorts & Entertainment (MLCO  -  Free Report) was down over 2% at market close.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions. Apple sold a mere 1 billion iPhones in 10 years but a new breakthrough is expected to generate more than 27 billion devices in just 3 years, creating a $1.7 trillion market.Zacks has just released a Special Report that spotlights this fast-emerging phenomenon and 6 tickers for taking advantage of it.
