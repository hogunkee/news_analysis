1,AWK,"Middlesex Water Company (MSEX  -  Free Report) recently announced that it is all set to commence its water infrastructure upgrade in the Avenel section of Woodbridge Township, NJ. The company will invest $11.2 million for the renovation or replacement of its aging water facilities.Notably, this latest upgrade comes under the company’s RENEW Program, an initiative undertaken to strengthen its water distribution infrastructure as well as water quality. As part of this program, the company aims to replace 4.8 miles of water mains, service lines, valves and fire hydrants. With the new mains, possessing greater water carrying capacity, being installed, this project will allow the company to improve its performance of fire flows and overall service quality.The entire RENEW project will take nearly six months for completion. However, individual customer would be affected only for a few days with the service being transferred from old to the new main.Ongoing Maintenance WorkRealizing the need for providing better water utility services, Middlesex Water has been making notable investments in infrastructural upgrades, in recent times like the latest one. In line with this, the company had announced a similar water infrastructure overhaul on May 31, 2017. Under this project, it planned to embark on a $10-million project to replace weathered water infrastructure in the Borough of South Plainfield, NJ. The company aimed at replacing 27,000 feet of water mains, service lines, valves, fire hydrants and meters.To consistently offer quality water services, the company has an objective to invest nearly $267 million during 2018-2020 time period for installation and relocation of water mains, service lines, wastewater collection system and setup of a new storage tank.

Such significant investments should allow the company to serve its customers better, going ahead.Water Industry Needs InvestmentThe U.S. water infrastructure is quite old and therefore, a massive investment is required to revamp the existing water and wastewater systems. Some of the water mains are nearly a century old and require immediate repair. Replacement of old transmission mains and renewal of treatment plants require hefty investments for restoring the water infrastructure to regain its lost shine. Considering this, other water utility providers are also following suit.Water utility American Water Works (AWK  -  Free Report) plans to invest in the range of $1.9-$2.1 billion for capital expenditures and acquisitions. The company aims at pumping $8.0-$8.6 billion into the mending activity from 2018 through 2022, which will help improve the company’s earnings by 7-10% per year in the period from a 2016 base.Another water utility Aqua America (WTR  -  Free Report) wants to invest in the range of more than $1.4 billion in the 2018-2020 time frame.Price MovementShares of Middlesex Water have returned 12.3% in the past year, outperforming the 1.8% growth of the industry it belongs to.Zacks Rank & Key PickCurrently, Middlesex Water has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The company, which has been investing in its water infrastructure since 2014, seeks to recover the capital put in.If approved without any changes, the new rate will be put into effect this August. It will also drive Washington Water’s annual revenues by $1.64 million, or 13.8%.Regular Investments in Utility SectorThe Utility sector is mature and fundamentally strong as demand for utility services barely changes with economic cycles. To maintain an uninterrupted supply of basic services, utilities need to upgrade, strengthen and modernize their infrastructure. Operating in a capital-intensive sector, utilities need to invest regularly to meet the rising customer demand.Water utilities are frequently required to upgrade and replace old pipelines and water mains through significant investments. To recover the cost of such investments and continue with upgrades to existing infrastructure, the companies file for rate hikes. Notably, Washington Water’s last rate hike was approved in February 2015.Consolidation in Utility SpaceConsolidation is the need of the hour in the fragmented U.S. water utility space. Water utility operation is highly fragmented in the United States and there are very few operators serving a few hundred customers. Aging water infrastructure needs upgrades and expansion to meet the growing demand.The company is not only investing in its existing assets on a continuous basis but is also planning to expand its service area through acquisitions. Recently, the company proposed to acquire SJW Group (SJW  -  Free Report). The plan is viewed as a strategic one as it will help the combined entity be the third-largest publicly traded water utility in the nation.Other water utilities are also expanding their operations through buyouts.

(Read more: American Water's Unit to Buy Wastewater System for $96M)Can Consolidation Help Aging Water Infrastructure?Consolidation is the need of the hour in the fragmented U.S. water utility space. Water utility operation is highly fragmented in the United States and there are a very small number of operators serving only a few hundred customers. Aging water infrastructure needs upgradation and expansion to meet the rising demand from customers.Small water operators will find it quite difficult to make these additions and upgrades in their existing systems, primarily due to the large amount of investment involved. It is easier for large companies to make arrangement for funds to carry out these major overhauls. Consolidation would therefore drive the necessary infrastructure overhauls that have become imperative for the industry at large.American Water Works, one of the largest water utilities, continues to widen its market footprint through strategic acquisitions. Till Jun 1, 2018, the company closed eight acquisitions, adding a total of 5,524 new customers. Pending 14 acquisitions as of the same date would increase American Water’s total customer base by 54,354 customers.Another water utility, Aqua America (WTR  -  Free Report) is also making strategic acquisitions to expand its operation and market reach.

6,AWK,"American Water Works Company (AWK  -  Free Report) announced that its subsidiary, Pennsylvania American Water has received directive from the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (PUC) to pass on the tax savings benefits resulting from the implementation of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) to customers.The new act became effective Jan 1, 2018 and lowered the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. This move will lead to reduction of about $47 million annually in the federal income tax that Pennsylvania American Water will pay to the government.Quality Service at Low PricesThe tax-cut savings will allow the residential customers of Pennsylvania American Water to enjoy safe and reliable services at a very competitive price.For water customers who typically use 5,000 gallons per month, the savings will be $5.27 or $63.24 per year, while wastewater customers, who typically use 5,000 gallons per month, will encounter savings of $6.58, or $78.96 per year.Tax Cuts — A Blessing for CustomersUtilities in some states are directed by the utility commission for implementing tax cuts to lower customers’ bills. Utilities are passing on the benefits to their customer base either through reduction in existing utility service rates or by adjusting their planned rate increases.Passing on tax savings does not look significant when we consider a single user or a single utility, however, it is significant when we consider the nation as a whole. Decisions have already been taken to pass on more than billions of dollars in tax savings to customers and we expect this amount to increase further.Recently, Duke Energy Corporation (DUK  -  Free Report) decided to pass on $142 million in tax savings to lower utility bills of Indiana-based customers if the proposed settlement is approved by the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission.Another utility, NextEra Energy (NEE  -  Free Report) has decided to use tax savings of nearly $1.3 billion to recoup the storm-recovery expenses, without increasing its users’ bills in Florida.Price MovementAmerican Water Works’ shares have returned 11.5% in the past year, outperforming the 1.7% growth of the  industry it belongs to.Zacks Rank and A Stock to ConsiderCurrently, American Water Works has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

30,AWK,"American Water Works Company, Inc. (AWK  -  Free Report) announced that its board of directors has approved an increase in the quarterly dividend rate by 9.6%. The revised dividend will be 45.5 cents, payable Jun 1, 2018, to shareholders of record at the close of business on May 11.The annualized dividend rate of the company comes to $1.82 while the current dividend yield is 2.17%, better than the S&P 500 yield of 1.83%. The hike is consistent with the company’s payout target ratio of 50-60% of net income.Thanks to consistent investments in its regulated operation, American Water Works is able to reliably serve its expanding customer base. Also, the improvement in net income helps the company to carry out shareholder-friendly moves. Including the current hike, the company has increased its dividend rate every year since its initial public offering in 2008.Can American Water Works Maintain the Dividend Trend?American Water Works is a regulated utility and invests in regulated operations to expand and upgrade its existing infrastructure.

51,AWK,"American States Water Company (AWR  -  Free Report) currently draws strength from its sturdy customer base. The company provides fresh water, wastewater services and electricity to 259,000 customers throughout 10 counties in California. It also distributes electricity to nearly 24,000 customers through its Golden State Water Company subsidiary.American States Water's systematic investments to strengthen existing infrastructure are anticipated to drive the company’s performance. Notably, the company is steadily investing toward strengthening existing water infrastructure.It is a prerequisite for a water service provider to have ample water right, and American States Water is no stranger to the trend. As of Dec 31, 2016, the company had adjudicated groundwater rights and surface water rights of 74,332 and 11,335 acre feet per year, respectively. In fact, a major portion of the company’s total revenues come from its Water segment.Further, the company enjoys one of the highest credit ratings in the water utility space. In May, Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services (S&P) affirmed the A+ credit rating on both American States Water and its subsidiary, Golden State Water Company. The strong credit ratings of American States Water are likely to aid the company in securing funds from the market amid the rising interest rates.American States Water is not so active in making accretive acquisitions like its peers. However, consolidation being the need of the hour in the fragmented U.S. water utility space, the old infrastructure needs ample investments. Such huge investments are easier for bigger players to make. Notably, utilities like American Water Works Company Inc. (AWK  -  Free Report), Connecticut Water Service Inc.  and Aqua America Inc. (WTR  -  Free Report) are active players in the industry that are expanding their market reach through acquisitions.The company’s focus still remains on a single state — California. Consequently, the financial performance of the company to a large extent is dependent on the political, water supply, labor, utility cost and regulatory risks as well as economic conditions, natural disasters and other risks affecting the state.Price MovementAmerican States Water returned 29% in the last 12 months, outperforming the 21.5% rally of the industry it belongs to.Zacks RankAmerican States Water carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

68,AWK,"Water stocks have long been underrated in the investment world since the basic necessity of life is most often taken for granted. We certainly cannot imagine a world without technology, but can we even survive in a world without fresh water? In the wake of drought conditions in California and other states last year, people can no longer be oblivious of the situation.Demand for fresh water – which accounts for a meager 2.5% of the world’s total water content – is growing along with urbanization and ever-increasing global population. Today, a major part of water infrastructure in the United States is approaching the end of its useful life. Are we nearing a time when we have to stop drinking water directly from the tap? Per the Natural Resource Defense Council, cities like Atlanta, Albuquerque, San Francisco, and Fresno have “fair-to-substandard” drinking water. If a city has substandard water quality, then tap water may be carrying a good number of contaminants. Consumers have started to question the quality of the water they drink.Upgrade and Replace – Need of the HourIn recent times, drinking and waste water infrastructure in the U.S. has been under the spotlight. The talking point right now is whether the amount of infrastructure investment planned by the U.S. government is equal to the sum required for replacing the aged and outmoded water infrastructure.The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) last conducted its Drinking Water Infrastructure Needs Survey and Assessment back in 2011. The report outlined that an investment of around $384 billion will be required over the next 20 years to modernize and upgrade U.S. water and waste water systems. On the other hand, a careful analysis by the American Water Works Association (AWWA) showed that about $1 trillion will be needed over the next 25 years only to restore underground pipes.Consolidation Holds the KeyThe water utility space is highly fragmented, as there are a number of water utilities in the U.S. operating on various scales ranging from thousands of customers to millions. The disjointed water industry has raised concerns about whether the smaller systems are sustainable in terms of competence and adaptability.A plausible solution is the consolidation and integration of local and regional systems into large-scale structures. This would free up access to the capital markets for infrastructure development in order to provide reliable water services. This also explains the frequent acquisitions taking place in this space right now.Top Players in the Water Industry The growing scarcity of water will definitely lead water utilities to prosperity, making them an enduring investment play. Big players in the water industry, like American Water Works (AWK  -  Free Report), are getting even bigger through a number of acquisitions and large infrastructure spending.American States Water Company (AWR  -  Free Report) has grown significantly since its foundation in 1929, and is the parent of Golden State Water Company and American States Utility Services Inc. AWR provides water services to roughly 259,000 customers in 10 counties in Northern, Coastal, and Southern California; it also distributes electricity to about 24,000 customers in the Big Bear recreational area of California. AWR is a #3 (Hold) on the Zacks Rank.Committed to providing its customers with safe, dependable, high-quality water, The York Water Company  operates entirely within its franchised territory, which covers 48 municipalities within York and Adam Counties in Pennsylvania. York Water is regulated by the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission, or PPUC, in the areas of billing, payment procedures, dispute processing, terminations, service territory, and rate setting. YORW is a #3 (Hold) on the Zacks Rank.California Water Service Group (CWT  -  Free Report) is also a consistent performer, serving about 477,900 customers in 83 California cities. The company’s unit – California Water Service Company – recently filed a General Rate Case with the CPUC, requesting authorization to increase water rates. The rate increase appeal was filed to reimburse planned expenditure of around $693 million in water supply sources, pipes, pumps, treatment plants, and other facilities that are needed to provide safe, reliable water services. CWT is a #3 (Hold) on the Zacks Rank.Operating through its wholly-owned subsidiaries San Jose Water Company, SJW Land Company, SJWTX Inc., and Texas Water Alliance Limited, SJW Group (SJW  -  Free Report) provides water services to approximately one million people throughout the metropolitan San Jose area, as well as in areas between Austin and San Antonio, Texas. The company also owns and operates commercial buildings in the states of California and Tennessee. SJW is a #3 (Hold) on the Zacks Rank.Share prices of each stock have increased significantly over the past year. AWR, YORW, CWT, and SJW gained 21.07%, 15.36%, 16.25%, and 27.90%. These water companies also have an impressive earnings track record, and are reliable dividend players, known for consistently sharing their profits with shareholders.ConclusionThough the water industry has long been affected by low rates and geographical and functional fragmentation, the pressing need of the hour is to replace hundreds of years of old pipelines and pumps. Now that most are in agreement that water is an essential element to all living things, the big question in the country is how to modernize dated infrastructure.In terms of investment opportunities, there is speculation that water will be the next oil. Moreover, recent droughts have definitely made us realize that water isn’t as abundant as we think. So, why not add some cool water stocks to your portfolio to quench that investment thirst.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

However, to keep the essential supplies running 24x7 we need to make provisions for the expenses involved in smooth running of the operation.If the rates are approved by the BPU without any changes, the average residential customer using 6,000 gallons of water a month would increase 36 cents per day or $10.80 per month. For an average customer, the rate will increase $6 per month.Investment Plans of American WaterAmerican Water Works aims to invest $6.7-$7.3 billion from 2017 through 2021, which will help it boost earnings by 7-10% per year in the aforesaid period from the 2015 base.

78,AWK,"The Q2 earnings season has crossed the halfway mark. As of Jul 28, 286 S&P 500 members came up with quarterly earnings. Total earnings are up 11.3% from the same period last year on 6.1% higher revenues. 74.5% of the companies beat EPS estimates while 69.2% topped revenue estimates.Nearly 1000 companies – including 130 S&P 500 members – are expected to come up with results this week. Combining the results of the reported index members (286 members till Jul 28) with the remaining 214 members of S&P 500, earnings are estimated to improve 9.2% on 5.0% higher revenues.Let us now focus on the water stocks within the utility sector, which is characterized by its defensive nature and domestic orientation. Initially, when the season started, we expected earnings to drop 2.9%. However, as the season gradually unfolds, we expect utility earnings to drop 1.8%.Per the survey of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), massive investments will be required to upgrade the existing old and soiled water and wastewater infrastructure. To avoid risk of contamination and wastage of potable water, there should be a concerted effort to replace and upgrade some of the century-old mains and pipelines that are still in use. An excess of $600 billion will be required to upgrade the water and wastewater systems in the next 20 years.Consolidation is the need of the hour in the fragmented U.S. water utility space. The old infrastructure needs ample investments, which are easier for bigger players to make. Consolidation would, therefore, drive the necessary infrastructure overhauls for the industry at large.Four out of the 16 sectors in the Zacks coverage universe are expected to witness an earnings decline this season.
