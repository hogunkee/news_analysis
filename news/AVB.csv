0,AVB,"Apartment Investment & Management Co. (AIV  -  Free Report), better known as Aimco, has received support from a broad coalition in the company’s appeal of the California court decision for its case against Airbnb. Particularly, the group backs Aimco’s measures to hold Airbnb legally responsible for engaging in brokering and endorsing illegal short-term rentals.Going by facts, per a December 2017 U.S. District Court ruling, Airbnb was provided ""immunity"" from liability for illegal short-term rentals brokering at Aimco’s apartment communities. This was granted on the basis of the federal Communications Decency Act (CDA) which protects online-service providers from the responsibility for the content users post.However, last month, Aimco filed its Ninth Circuit brief in the company’s appeal of the December 2017 ruling. And now the coalition has filed amicus briefs in support of Aimco’s appeal that the CDA does not offer such broad immunity to Airbnb.Among the members in the coalition, are names like National Multifamily Housing Council and the National Apartment Association; the California Apartment Association and Avalon Bay Communities; the League of California Cities, International Municipal Lawyers Association and California State Association of Counties; the American Hotel and Lodging Association; and others. All these strengthen Aimco’s appeal and raise hopes for the reconsideration of the ruling.Moreover, an amicus brief, pointing out the troubles created by Airbnb to affordable housing and stable communities, has been filed with the court by a group of New York neighborhood associations.According to Aimco's legal representative Mike Williams, ""Airbnb is a full-fledged real estate broker of illegal short-term rentals and should be held to the same level of scrutiny and accountability as a 'brick-and-mortar' broker engaged in comparable unauthorized activities.""According to Aimco and the parties supporting its appeal, rather than focusing on Airbnb’s act of publishing of property listings, the company should be held legally accountable for illegal short-term rental activities, as such doings pose a threat to the safety and quality of life of full-time residents. In fact, per the company, though prospective Aimco residents go through criminal background checks, several Airbnb customers are not thoroughly examined and are unknown trespassers. These customers not only pose a risk to safety but have also triggered disruption and damaged property at Aimco’s apartment premises.Such a support from the broader fraternity is a positive for the company. Moreover, Aimco is making diligent efforts to reposition its portfolio by shedding non-strategic properties and investing the proceeds in opportunistic acquisitions. The company’s portfolio is diversified in terms of geography and price point, and its revamping efforts have the capability to drive long-term growth.However, the dilutive impact on earnings from such asset dispositions cannot be bypassed in the near term. Also, new supply in various markets, which is affecting other residential REITs like AvalonBay Communities, Inc. (AVB  -  Free Report), Equity Residential (EQR  -  Free Report) and Essex Property Trust, Inc. (ESS  -  Free Report), is also anticipated to dampen the company’s rent growth and new-lease pricing ability. Hike in interest rate adds to its woes.Aimco currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1,AVB,"If stellar job growth in recent months indicates more household formations and raises expectations for a robust revival of the apartment market fundamentals, then we should, perhaps, think twice.This is because per the latest report from the real estate technology and analytics firm RealPage, Inc. (RP  -  Free Report), with several markets experiencing flat rents, U.S. apartment rents have increased at an annual pace of just 2.3% as of mid-2018 — marking the slowest pace in eight years. While a mid-2018 occupancy level of 95.0% is still healthy, the deceleration in rent growth suggests that a competitive leasing environment is building up fast, and curbing landlords’ pricing power.While there was a moderation in the first quarter too, but the January-March quarter usually has a sluggish leasing period due to the cold weather that inhibits shift of households and limits growth in demand. Therefore, achieving a solid pricing power in the second quarter is significant, as otherwise, landlords find it difficult to recoup the same later in the year. This is because prior to the onset of the seasonal slowdown in leasing, pressure of filling units is more prevalent in the market than pushing rent levels north.However, during Q2 this year, the market recorded a pricing increase of 1.8%. In fact, rent growth was slower than the pace experienced during the same period in the earlier years. In the 2014-2017 period, rent growth in the April-June quarter averaged 2.3%.Furthermore, this turbulent environment is unlikely to end any time soon and offer respite, as the struggle to lure renters will definitely continue into the upcoming quarters as well, when much of new supply is expected to come on course.According to the RealPage report, the “annual pace of completions” climbed above the 300,000-unit level for four consecutive quarters. Additionally, through mid-2019, annual deliveries will keep adding on to the flow with around 300,000 units.Therefore, landlords’ ability to command more rents will most likely remain stunted and concessions might be rampant in the near term. This, again, is feared to cast a pall on residential REIT stocks like Apartment Investment & Management Co. (AIV  -  Free Report), better known as Aimco, American Homes 4 Rent (AMH  -  Free Report), AvalonBay Communities, Inc. (AVB  -  Free Report) and Equity Residential (EQR  -  Free Report).While AvalonBay and Equity Residential currently have a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), Aimco and American Homes 4 Rent carry a Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell), underlining downward revisions of the 2018 funds from operations (FFO) per share estimate in recent months.(You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.)Note: Anything related to earnings presented in this write-up represents funds from operations (FFO) — a widely used metric to gauge the performance of REITs.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

2,AVB,"In the peak leasing season, residential REIT AvalonBay Communities Inc. (AVB  -  Free Report) is expected to benefit from its high quality assets located in some of the premium markets of the country. In fact, in 2017, the company delivered the seventh consecutive year of above-sector average core funds from operations (FFO) per share growth, which is encouraging. Based on its strong fundamentals, this uptrend is expected to continue going forward.Moreover, in the recently-announced quarterly update, AvalonBay noted that it expects total rental revenues for established communities in Q2 to climb 2.4-2.5% from the prior-year period. The mid-point of the latest outlook denotes a 15-basis-point expansion from what the company had previously projected. The company had reported a 2.4% increase in rental revenues for established communities in the first quarter.Increasing consumer confidence backed by job growth, rising wages and a healthier balance sheet promise solid prospects for AvalonBay. Additionally, corporate profits are up and business confidence has recovered.Also, demographic growth continues to be strong in the young-adult age cohort, which has a higher propensity to rent. This age cohort has also experienced a considerable part of net job growth and is helping spur primary renter demand. Household formation is also picking up pace, which is encouraging.Furthermore, the company has a healthy balance sheet and ample liquidity to support its growth needs. As of Mar 31, 2018, AvalonBay had no borrowings outstanding under its $1.5-billion unsecured credit facility. In addition, the company’s annualized net debt-to-core EBITDA for first-quarter 2018 was 5.1 times.Nonetheless, hike in interest rate can pose a challenge for the company. Essentially, rising rates imply higher borrowing cost for the company, which may affect its ability to purchase or develop real estate and lower dividend payouts as well. Further, the dividend payout might become less attractive compared to the yields on fixed income and money market accounts.In addition to the above, new apartment deliveries are anticipated to remain elevated in the company’s markets in 2018 and modestly decrease in 2019. Specifically, Metro New York, New Jersey and Mid-Atlantic regions are likely to remain choppy amid rising supply of residential units in upcoming quarters.In addition, supply continues to be most noticeable in the urban sub-markets. This high supply in a number of the company’s markets is likely to put pressure on rental rates. Hence, growth in its stabilized portfolio is likely to remain modest in the upcoming period. Furthermore, there is high concession activity amid higher supply, which remains a concern.Nevertheless, AvalonBay is not the only company reeling under this high supply pressure. Other residential REITS like Equity Residential (EQR  -  Free Report) and Essex Property Trust Inc. (ESS  -  Free Report) too are facing the brunt. This unhealthy environment is unlikely to dissipate any time soon, with aggressive deliveries feared to continue into early next year as well.Per a report from real estate technology and analytics firm — RealPage, Inc. (RP  -  Free Report) — during the last half of 2017, across the nation’s 150 largest metros “annual pace of completions” climbed above the 300,000-unit level. Further, through early 2019, “scheduled new supply” will keep adding on to the flow at about the same annual pace.AvalonBay currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

3,AVB,"In the recently-announced quarterly update, residential REIT AvalonBay Communities Inc. (AVB  -  Free Report) noted that it expects total rental revenues for established communities in Q2 to climb 2.4-2.5% from the prior-year period.The midpoint of the latest outlook denotes a 15 basis point expansion from what the company had previously projected for the second quarter when it provided the 2018 established communities total rental revenue growth outlook this January. The company reported a 2.4% increase in rental revenues for established communities in the first quarter.Established communities refer to those consolidated communities which have stabilized occupancy as of Jan 1, 2017, and are neither executing nor planning any significant redevelopment work, and are not held for sale or planned for disposition in the current year.Moreover, the company mentioned that it has begun construction on two new communities for an estimated total capital cost of around $205 million in the second quarter. On the other hand, the company sold two wholly-owned operating communities for approximately $195 million. Two other wholly-owned communities are under contract or in advanced marketing stages for a projected price of around $280 million.Notably, in the peak leasing session, AvalonBay is expected to benefit from its high quality assets in premium locations, favorable demographics, household formation, recovering economy and job market growth.However, new apartment deliveries are anticipated to remain elevated in the company’s markets in 2018 and modestly descend in 2019. Specifically, the Metro New York, New Jersey and Mid-Atlantic regions are likely to remain turbulent amid rising supply of residential units in the upcoming quarters. In fact, in the Mid-Atlantic region, supply is expected to continue through 2019, while in New York, New Jersey market, supply might attain peak level this year, before declining in 2019. Additionally, supply continues to be the most noticeable in the urban sub-markets.This high supply in a number of the company’s markets is likely to put pressure on rental rates. Hence, growth in AvalonBay’s stabilized portfolio is expected to remain modest in the near future. Furthermore, there is high concession activity amid higher supply, which remains a concern.Nonetheless, this elevated supply has not only affected AvalonBay, but other residential REITs as well, including Equity Residential (EQR  -  Free Report) and Essex Property Trust Inc. (ESS  -  Free Report), curbing their near-term growth momentum to some extent. And there seems to be no respite from this   dreary environment any time soon, with aggressive deliveries anticipated to continue through early next year too.In fact, according to a report from real estate technology and analytics firm — RealPage, Inc.

4,AVB,"AvalonBay Communities (AVB  -  Free Report), along with Terra, which is a development firm based in Florida, has purchased portions of a redevelopment project in Doral for $33.5 million, as a report by the Bizjournal.Presently, the property has offices spanning 136,892 square feet and a 4,322-square-feet restaurant. Both of these will be knocked down to build a mixed-use project named Atrium.The company plans to construct 350 apartments in an eight-storied building. An affiliate of AvalonBay, Avalon Doral LLC has purchased the land, spanning 4.57 acres, for $20 million. Stantic is the architect for this project.Moreover, the other 5.23 acres were bought by an affiliate of Terra called Doral Atrium Retail Investments for $13.5 million and they plan to construct retail space covering 90,000 square feet. This space will be developed by Beame Architectural Partnership.Notably, AvalonBay has high-quality assets located in some of the premium markets of the country, which enable it to generate steady rental revenues. In fact, in 2017, the company delivered the seventh consecutive year of above-sector average core FFO per share growth. Going forward, based on the company’s strong fundamentals, we expect the uptrend to continue.Further, increasing consumer confidence on the back of job growth, rising wages and a healthier balance sheet promise solid prospects for AvalonBay. Additionally, corporate profits are up and business confidence has recovered. Also, demographic growth continues to be strong in the young-adult age cohort, which has a higher propensity to rent.In fact, a significant change in lifestyle has taken place and life-cycle events are getting delayed. This is leading to an extension of the average age of first-time homeownership. This age cohort has also experienced a considerable part of the net job growth and is helping to increase primary renter demand. Household formation is picking up pace as well.Nonetheless, the company faces stiff competition from other housing alternatives such as rental apartments, condominiums and single-family homes. Such a competitive landscape limits AvalonBay’s ability to increase rent, thereby restricting its growth momentum.AvalonBay currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

5,AVB,"AvalonBay Communities, Inc.’s (AVB  -  Free Report) first-quarter 2018 core funds from operations (FFO) per share of $2.18 came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The company’s core FFO per share also recorded 4.3% growth from the year-ago figure of $2.09.Total revenues of $560.8 million increased 7.4% year over year, as revenues from development communities and stabilized operating communities recorded growth. The revenue figure also came in higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $558.5 million.Results highlight growth in average rental rates. However, occupancy level declined marginally, while operating expense flared up due to property taxes, payroll and insurance costs.Quarter in Detail   For the reported quarter, average rental rates were up 2.5% year over year, while economic occupancy edged down 0.1% from the year-ago quarter.Revenues from established communities — those that have stabilized operations as of Jan 1, 2017, are neither executing nor planning any significant redevelopment work, and are not held for sale or planned for disposition within the current year — improved 2.4% year over year, indicating increase in average rental rates but partially offset by a decline in economic occupancy.However, operating expenses for established communities escalated 5.3% on a year-over-year basis. Consequently, NOI from established communities inched up 1.2 % year over year to around $295.4 million.Notably, during the first quarter, the company accomplished the development of three communities, for an aggregate total capital cost of $287.0 million. These communities comprise a total of 770 apartment homes. Further, the company purchased two land parcels for future development, for a total investment of $57.08 million. The company intends to commence construction of apartment communities on this land this year.As of Mar 31, 2018, AvalonBay had 18 communities under construction (expected to contain in total 5,774 apartment homes and 97,000 square feet of retail space), which are anticipated to be accomplished for an estimated total capital cost of $2.65 billion. This includes the company’s share of communities being developed through joint ventures.Liquidity PositionAs of Mar 31, 2018, AvalonBay had no borrowings outstanding under its $1.5-billion unsecured credit facility. The company had around $271.4 million in unrestricted cash and cash in escrow as of that date. In addition, the company’s annualized net debt-to-core EBITDA for first-quarter 2018 was 5.1 times.OutlookFor second-quarter 2018, AvalonBay expects core FFO per share of $2.16-$2.22. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is currently pegged at $2.21.In ConclusionAvalonBay is well poised to grow on the back of its solid portfolio of high-quality assets in premium locations. Furthermore, the company has a healthy balance sheet. Moreover, stellar job growth in recent months indicates more household formations and raises expectations for higher apartment demand during the peak leasing period.Nevertheless, there is presence of elevated supply in a number of the company’s markets. In addition, high concession activity amid elevated supply remains a concern. Hence, growth in its stabilized portfolio is likely to remain modest in the upcoming period. Rate hike remains another concern.AvalonBay currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. AvalonBay Communities, Inc.

6,AVB,"We are in the heart of the Q1 reporting cycle and the real estate investment trust (REIT) space is buzzing with activity. In fact, there is a deluge of Q1 earnings releases lined up for this week, of which AvalonBay Communities, Inc. (AVB  -  Free Report), Duke Realty Corporation (DRE  -  Free Report), Public Storage (PSA  -  Free Report) and UDR Inc. (UDR  -  Free Report) will release quarterly numbers on Apr 25.Rate hike and cautious approach of investors have affected returns from this industry, so far, this year. However, with underlying asset categories and the location of properties playing a crucial role in determining REITs’ performance, not all players in the space are equally poised to excel or fall behind this season.Per a study by the commercial real estate services firm — CBRE Group Inc. (CBRE  -  Free Report) — availability fell for 31 straight quarters to 7.3% for the U.S. industrial market in first-quarter 2018. The figure not only marked a contraction of 6 basis points (bps) sequentially, but also shrunk 20 bps, year over year, on average, across 50 markets that are followed by CBRE. Moreover, net asking rents inched up 1.9% in Q1 to $7.01 per square foot, denoting the highest mark since CBRE started following the metric in 1989. High consumption levels, strengthening e-commerce market, and a healthy manufacturing environment amid recovering economy and job market are fueling demand.However, the latest report from the real estate technology and analytics firm — RealPage, Inc. (RP  -  Free Report) — states that the national apartment market moderated in the Jan-Mar quarter. Nevertheless, the first quarter marks a slow leasing period, thanks to the cold weather that inhibits shift of households and limits growth in demand.Going by statistics, annual rent growth shrunk to 2.3% in Q1. This marked moderation from the 2.6-2.9% growth rate experienced throughout 2017. Occupancy level of 94.5% this March edged down from the prior-year tally of 95%, with metros having subdued construction activity faring well and recording the strongest occupancy. Nevertheless, the overall occupancy level is still healthy.Furthermore, the self-storage industry is anticipated to experience solid demand backed by favorable demographic changes, improving job market and rising incomes, as well as events like marriages, shifting, death, and even divorce. Also, due to shorter leasing periods, this REIT has the power to adjust its rents quickly to any rate hike.Therefore, let’s have a close look at the factors that will impact the above-mentioned REITs’ first-quarter results.AvalonBay Communities Inc.Residential REIT AvalonBay is well poised to grow on the back of rising demand from household formation and favorable demographics. Additionally, increasing consumer confidence driven by job growth, higher wages and a healthier balance sheet promises brighter prospects for this Arlington, VA-based REIT. Amid these, the company is likely to continue experiencing high occupancy.However, there is an increasing apartment supply in a number of markets of the company. This high supply is expected to have put pressure on rental rates in the to-be-reported quarter. In addition, there is high-concession activity amid elevated supply, which remains a concern.  (Read more: AvalonBay to Post Q1 Earnings: What's in the Cards?)In a March-issued operating update for the first quarter, AvalonBay stated that it expects total rental revenues for established communities to be up 2.3-2.4% year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter revenues is $558.5 million, denoting an expected increase of 6.9% year over year. Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for funds from operations (FFO) per share is pegged at $2.18, indicating projected increase of 4.3% year over year.Moreover, our proven model does not conclusively show that AvalonBay is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a bullish Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here, as you will see below.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.In fact, though AvalonBay has a favorable Zacks Rank of 3, its Earnings ESP of -0.28% makes surprise prediction difficult.Moreover, AvalonBay has a mixed surprise history, as evident from the chart below:AvalonBay Communities, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  AvalonBay Communities, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | AvalonBay Communities, Inc. QuoteDuke Realty CorporationIn recent years, Duke Realty has made concerted efforts to enhance its industrial portfolio. Admittedly, this asset class has been witnessing improving fundamentals amid economic recovery and growth of e-commerce business. This is spurring demand for warehouse space as companies are compelled to enhance and renovate their distribution and production platforms, helping the industrial real estate market to record growth.Nonetheless, Duke Realty is enhancing its portfolio mix through continued divestitures, which includes the significant disposition of sub-urban office assets and medical office buildings. While such efforts are a strategic fit for the long term, the near-term dilutive effect on earnings cannot be bypassed. Furthermore, the company faces significant competition from developers, owners and operators of the commercial real estate. This influences its ability to attract and retain tenants at relatively higher rents than its competitors. (Read more: Duke Realty to Post Q1 Earnings: What's in the Offing?)The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter revenues is currently pegged at $183.8 million, indicating a decline of 15.7% year over year. Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share is 30 cents, pointing to an estimated year-over-year decline of 6.3%.Although Duke Realty has a favorable Zacks Rank of 3, its Earnings ESP of -1.70% lowers chances of any positive surprise this season.The story about Duke Realty’s decent surprise history is better told by the chart below:Duke Realty Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Duke Realty Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Duke Realty Corporation QuotePublic StoragePublic Storage is one of the largest owners and operators of storage facilities in the United States. High brand value, strategic acquisitions, robust presence in key cities and healthy balance sheet serve as major growth drivers for the company. The company is likely to be able to achieve reasonable rate hike for its existing customers. In addition, acquisition and expansion initiatives are anticipated to stoke growth.Amid these, the company remains well poised to record growth in revenues. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $668.9 million, depicting projected rise of 3.6%. Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share is currently pegged at $2.46, indicating an expected rise of 5.1% year over year.Nevertheless, supply has been rising in a number of markets and this adversely affects the company’s pricing power. In fact, it operates in a highly fragmented market in the nation, with intense competition from numerous private, regional and local operators. This, in turn, limits the company’s power to raise rents and turn on more discounting.

Additionally, it has a superior portfolio in targeted U.S. markets and adheres to disciplined capital allocation. These are likely to drive results in the to-be-reported quarter. Specifically, the company is predicted to benefit from favorable demographic trends. There is a steady demand for rental apartments from both new millennial households and empty nesters. Along with this, the healthy job market is estimated to drive demand for apartments.However, the company has been dealing with escalating deliveries in a number of its markets. This remains a concern as elevated levels of supply curtail landlords’ ability to demand higher rents and result in lesser absorption. Consequently, concession levels are estimated to have remained at the higher end, while UDR’s pricing power might have been limited in the quarter.

Also, increasing consumer confidence on the back of job growth, higher wages and a healthier balance sheet promises bright prospects for this Arlington, VA-based REIT.Amid these, the company is likely to continue experiencing high occupancy.  Moreover, in a March-issued operating update for the first quarter, AvalonBay stated that it expects total rental revenues for established communities to be up 2.3-2.4% year over year.Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of average rental rates at established communities is pegged at  $2,539, indicating a marginal rise sequentially. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter revenues is $558.5 million, denoting an expected increase of 6.9% year over year.However, per the latest report from the real estate technology and analytics firm — RealPage, Inc. — the national apartment market was moderated in first-quarter 2018, with occupancy shrinking slightly and rent growth slowing down. Nevertheless, the first quarter marks a slow leasing period, thanks to the cold weather that inhibits shift of households and limits growth in demand.Going by statistics, the annual rent growth shrunk to 2.3% in Q1. This marked moderation from the 2.6-2.9% growth rate experienced throughout 2017. Occupancy level of 94.5% in March edged down from the prior-year tally of 95%, with metros having subdued construction activity faring well and recording the strongest occupancy. Nevertheless, the overall occupancy level is still healthy.Moreover, there is an increasing apartment supply in a number of markets of the company. This high supply is likely to put pressure on rental rates in the to-be-reported quarter. In addition, there is high-concession activity amid elevated supply, which remains a concern.Furthermore, the company’s activities during the quarter were inadequate to gain analysts’ confidence. Consequently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate witnessed a marginal decline over the last 30 days and is currently pegged at $2.19. Nevertheless, this indicates a 4.8% increase year over year.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that AvalonBay is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a bullish Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here, as you will see below.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: AvalonBay has an Earnings ESP of -1.06%, representing the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Zacks Rank: AvalonBay’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident about a positive surprise.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a few stocks in the REIT sector that you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to report a positive surprise this quarter:PS Business Parks, Inc. (PSB  -  Free Report), scheduled to release first-quarter results on Apr 24, has an Earnings ESP of +0.67% and a Zacks Rank #3.

By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

8,AVB,"Vident Financial launched a new fund on Mar 27, focused on providing exposure to the real estate space of the United States equity market.U.S. Diversified Real Estate ETF (PPTY  -  Free Report) seeks to track, before fees and expenses, the performance of the U.S. Diversified Real Estate Index.Fund CharacteristicsThe fund’s index seeks to employ a rules based approach to offer investors a multi-factor alternative to traditional market cap-weighted real estate funds. “If you ask for the three most important factors when investing in real estate, you’ll probably hear ‘location, location, location.’ To this we’d add property type and leverage,” per a Business Wire article citing Fred Stoops, head of real estate investments at Vident.The fund amassed $9 million in AUM within a few days of trading. It charges a fee of 53 basis points a year.  The fund’s top three holdings include Equity Residential (EQR  -  Free Report), Avalonbay Communities Inc (AVB  -  Free Report) and Terreno Realty Corp (TRNO  -  Free Report), with 3.8%, 3.4% and 3.0% exposure, respectively.How Does it Fit in a Portfolio?The Real Estate segment of the U.S. market has played an integral role in the expansion of the U.S. economy. Although it requires immense knowledge about the sector and bears significant risks, equity funds providing exposure to the sector are a great way to diversify traditional portfolios.  Owing to its low correlation with other asset classes, the real estate sector is a great diversifier. Moreover, real estate investments are a great way to gain inflation protection, as rising prices increase the resale value of the property and it can also be used to generate rental income.   CompetitionThe fund faces intense competition. Below we discuss a few ETFs that seek to provide exposure to the real estate sector.iShares U.S. Real Estate ETF (IYR  -  Free Report)This fund seeks to provide exposure to real estate stocks and tracks the Dow Jones U.S. Real Estate Index.

9,AVB,"If solid job growth in recent months indicates more household formations and raises expectations for a robust revival of the apartment market fundamentals, then we should perhaps think twice.This is because the latest report from the real estate technology and analytics firm — RealPage, Inc. (RP  -  Free Report) — states that the national apartment market indeed moderated in first-quarter 2018, with occupancy shrinking and rent growth slowing down. And there seems to be no respite from this choppy environment any time soon, with aggressive deliveries anticipated to continue through early next year too.Of course, the first quarter marks a slow leasing period, thanks to the cold weather that inhibits shift of households and limits growth in demand. However, a whole lot of new supply is the ultimate culprit, fueling competition and curbing landlords’ pricing power.Going by statistics, the annual rent growth pace shrunk to 2.3% in Q1. This not only marked moderation from the 2.6-2.9% growth rate experienced throughout 2017 but, in fact, denoted the slowest growth since third-quarter 2010. Notably, the market had achieved an annual price increase of 5.3% in the third quarter of 2015, which represented this economic cycle’s highest rent growth.Also, occupancy level of 94.5% this March edged down from the prior-year tally of 95%, with metros having subdued construction activity faring well and recording the strongest occupancy. Although the overall occupancy level is still healthy, the deceleration suggests that a competitive leasing environment is fast building up, and any robust upturn in occupancy seems elusive in the near term.This is quite obvious when so much of new supply is likely to come on course. According to the RealPage report, during the last half of 2017, across the nation’s 150 largest metros “annual pace of completions” climbed above the 300,000-unit level. Further, through early 2019, “scheduled new supply” will keep adding on to the flow at about the same annual pace.Admittedly, the performance of residential REITs in recent quarters has been affected by elevated supply of new units in the market. The anticipation of continued stress in the environment might impact landlords’ ability to command higher rents and fill up vacant spaces. So, pressure on new lease rates, occupancy as well as retention would persist, while concession activity to lure renters is expected to remain high.Now it’s time for investors to consider portfolio reshuffling and discard some stocks from the said sector, which are unlikely to bounce back in the near term. Among these are:AvalonBay Communities Inc. (AVB  -  Free Report), a residential REIT, which owned or held direct or indirect ownership stake in 288 apartment communities as of Dec 31, 2017. The company’s shares have underperformed its industry, in the past three months. During this time period, shares of the company have lost 4.8%, whereas the industry incurred a 2.8% loss. Additionally, the stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 and 2019 funds from operations (FFO) per share being revised 1.3% and 1.6% downward in two months’ time, reflecting bearish analyst sentiment.Apartment Investment & Management Co. (AIV  -  Free Report), better known as Aimco, has ownership stakes in 182 communities across 22 states and the District of Columbia. The company’s shares have declined 3.8% and underperformed the industry it belongs to, in three months’ time. Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 and 2019 FFO per share have both been revised 0.8% downward in a month’s time.Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. (MAA  -  Free Report) — commonly referred as MAA — enjoyed ownership stake in 100,489 apartment units as of Dec 31, 2017. The company’s shares have underperformed the industry it belongs to over the past three months, with a 4.1% decline. Moreover, the stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for both 2018 and 2019 FFO per share being revised 0.8% downward in the last month.Note: Anything related to earnings presented in this write-up represents funds from operations (FFO) — a widely used metric to gauge the performance of REITs.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

It offers easy access to wide range of retail and employment localities. It has around 343,138 rentable square feet within 15 apartment buildings.Moreover, with its location between the high-demand neighborhoods of Lower Downtown, Lower Highlands and River North Art District, the property is likely to command much attention and experience high occupancy. In fact, the property is already 93.5% occupied, currently.Notably, the Denver market has grabbed the attention of well-educated workers in knowledge-based industries. Its economy is healthy and diverse. This makes the acquisition a strategic fit for IRET which intends to strengthen its presence in the region.In fact, together with Minneapolis-St. Paul, Denver is a crucial market where IRET intends to boost its portfolio and achieve operating efficiencies. Earlier, the company closed the buyout of a 274-home apartment community — Dylan — in Denver.Besides IRET fortifying its presence in the region, well-known residential REIT AvalonBay Communities, Inc.

11,AVB,"In the recently-issued operating update for the first quarter of 2018, AvalonBay Communities, Inc. (AVB  -  Free Report) stated that it expects total rental revenues for established communities to be up 2.3–2.4% year over year.Notably, in the prior quarter, the company had reported 2.2% growth in total revenues for established communities. Results indicated increase in average rental rates and economic occupancy. Specifically, for fourth-quarter 2017, average rental rates were up 2.1% year over year, while economic occupancy inched up 0.1% from the year-ago quarter.AvalonBay has high quality assets located in some of the premium markets of the country, which enable the company to generate steady rental revenues. In fact, the company delivered the seventh consecutive year of above-sector average core funds from operations (FFO) per share growth, which is encouraging. Based on its strong fundamentals, we expect this uptrend to continue. Increasing consumer confidence on the back of job growth, rising wages and a healthier balance sheet promise bright prospects for AvalonBay.However, new apartment deliveries are anticipated to remain elevated in the near term and this has emerged as a pressing concern for the residential REITs, including AvalonBay, Equity Residential (EQR  -  Free Report), Apartment Investment & Management Co. (AIV  -  Free Report) and Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. (MAA  -  Free Report).Particularly, for AvalonBay, considering the regions, deliveries are projected to increase in both Southern California and the Pacific Northwest. Additionally, supply continues to be most noticeable in the urban submarkets. This high supply in a number of the company’s markets is likely to put pressure on rental rates. Hence, growth in its stabilized portfolio might remain modest in the upcoming period. Furthermore, there is high concession activity amid elevated supply, which remains a concern.Currently, AvalonBay has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

12,AVB,"Ushering in good news for its shareholders, recently Digital Realty (DLR  -  Free Report) announced that its board has approved an 8.6% hike in quarterly common stock cash dividend rate to $1.01 from the 93 cents paid earlier.The new dividend for the first quarter of 2018 will be paid on Mar 30 to shareholders of record on Mar 15, 2018. Based on this hiked value, annualized yield comes in at about 4.1%, considering Digital Realty' closing price of $98.20 on Mar 2.Notably, Digital Realty has a solid track record of enhancing shareholders’ wealth. The company has raised dividend every year since its initial public offering and the March 2018 hike marks the 13th consecutive year of increase.We believe Digital Realty has solid scope of generating steady growth in cash flow to support its dividend policy. Last month, the company reported fourth-quarter 2017 core funds from operations (FFO) per share of $1.55 which exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.52. The core FFO per share also came in higher than the year-ago quarter’s tally of $1.43. Results were supported by growth in revenues.With growth in cloud computing, Internet of Things and big data, and an increasing number of companies opting for third-party IT infrastructure, data-center REITs are experiencing a boom market. In fact, demand is outpacing supply in top-tier data center markets and despite enjoying high occupancy, the top tier markets are absorbing new construction at a faster pace. This, along with an improved outlook for economic growth, is anticipated to drive demand for data centers. Amid these, accretive acquisitions and development efforts are expected to drive top-line growth.In September 2017, Digital Realty announced the completion of a merger with DuPont Fabros in an all-stock deal, for an enterprise value of about $7.8 billion. This move enhanced Digital Realty’s portfolio in the top U.S. data center metro areas across Northern Virginia, Chicago and Silicon Valley. It helped Digital Realty enhance hyper-scale product offering and grow its blue-chip customer base.Further, the company focuses on maintaining an investment grade balance sheet and is committed to a conservative capital structure. It enjoys ample and growing liquidity, with diversified sources of capital and has a well-laddered debt maturity schedule with no material maturities until 2020.However, the company faces intense competition in the industry. Amid this, aggressive pricing pressure is likely to continue in the upcoming period. Moreover, Digital Realty’s earnings have a notable exposure to foreign currency translation. Also, the company has a substantial debt burden. Further, rate hike adds to its woes.Digital Realty currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

13,AVB,"Ushering in good news for its shareholders, Armada Hoffler Properties, Inc. (AHH  -  Free Report) recently announced a 5.3% hike in its quarterly cash dividend. The company will now pay a dividend of 20 cents per share, up from 19 cents paid earlier. The raised dividend will be paid on Apr 5, 2018, to shareholders of record as on Mar 28.Based on the increased rate, the annual dividend comes to 80 cents a share, resulting in a yield of about 5.9%, considering Armada Hoffler’s closing price of $13.47 on Feb 23. Since the company’s dividend yield surpassed the industry average of 4%, the stock is likely to draw investors’ attention.In fact, solid dividend payouts are arguably the biggest enticement for REIT investors and this represents Armada Hoffler’s 4th hike in common stock dividend in four years, reflecting 25% dividend growth during that time frame.Investors interested in this self-managed real estate investment trust (""REIT"") stock can have a look at its fundamentals and growth prospects.Earnings Strength: Armada Hoffler depicts a stable earnings picture. In the past three to five years, the bank witnessed funds from operations growth of 7.2%. Also, the company’s earnings are projected to grow at the rate of 105.1% for the current year.Return on Equity (ROE): The company’s ROE of 6.23% is higher than the industry average of 2.99%. This reflects that it is more efficient in utilizing shareholder funds compared to its peers.Revenue Growth: Growth remains a key strength at Armada Hoffler as reflected by its revenue growth story. For the full-year 2017, the company witnessed year-over-year growth in revenues of 17.2%. Further, the company’s sales are projected to grow 8.4% in 2018.The stock has dropped 11.5% in the past three months, outperforming the 12.4% loss incurred by the industry it belongs to.Armada Hoffler currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

14,AVB,"Recently, Prologis Inc.’s (PLD  -  Free Report) board approved a 9% hike in its annualized dividend rate to $1.92 from the $1.76 paid earlier. As a result, the company will now pay 48 cents per share as against 44 cents paid in the prior quarter.The new dividend will be paid on Mar 29 to shareholders of record on Mar 15, 2018. Based on this hiked value, annualized yield comes in at about 3.2%, considering Prologis' closing price of $59.94 on Feb 22.We believe Prologis has an adequate capacity to support its dividend policy. Last month, the company reported decent fourth-quarter 2017 core funds from operations (FFO). It experienced solid operating results and higher net promote income. Net effective rent change improved in the quarter, while period-end occupancy also remained at a record high.Notably, the industrial real estate market has been enjoying elevated demand for logistics infrastructure amid an e-commerce boom, recovering economy and job market, as well as healthy manufacturing environment. This has been providing Prologis ample scope to tap growth opportunities.In addition, Prologis’ build-to-suit activity remained solid in 2017. The company completed 33 build-to-suit projects, covering more than 12 million square feet of space, in the year. It also started 38 projects, which have a total expected investment of nearly $1.1 billion, in 2017. Furthermore, the company’s ratio of built-to-suit activity to overall development starts achieved the highest level since 2013. This high number of build-to-suit development projects highlights the advantageous location of the company’s rich land bank and the robust network of multi-site customers which is increasingly focusing on e-commerce.Prologis is also focused on bolstering its liquidity. The company continues to have significant liquidity of $3.6 billion. In addition, for the full year, the company reported a 340-basis-point contraction in leverage to 23.7% on a market capitalization basis and debt-to-adjusted EBITDA improved around 0.2x-4.6x. Given its balance-sheet strength and prudent financial management, the company remains well poised to capitalize on growth opportunities and reward shareholders accordingly.However, a whole lot of new buildings are slated to be completed and made available in the market in the near term, leading to higher supply, and lesser scope for rent and occupancy growth. Also, rate hikes have added to the company’s woes.Prologis currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

15,AVB,"Residential real estate investment trust (REIT) Essex Property Trust Inc. (ESS  -  Free Report) delivered an in-line performance for fourth-quarter 2017. The company reported core funds from operations (FFO) per share of $3.01 for the quarter, meeting the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Core FFO per share improved 7.1% from the year-ago quarter figure of $2.81.Results reflect solid growth in net operating income (NOI) and high occupancy level.Total revenues of $345.1 million in the quarter grew 4.9% year over year. However, the figure narrowly missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $346.5 million.In 2018, management expects housing demand to surpass supply in coastal markets of California and Washington. This is likely to result in growth in market rent close to long-term averages. Specifically, West Coast is anticipated to outdo the nation both in terms of rent growth as well as job growth in the year.For full-year 2017, core FFO per share came in at $11.91, 7.9% ahead of the prior-year tally of $11.04. This was backed by 5.4% year-over-year growth in total revenues to $1.4 billion.Following the earnings release on Feb 7, shares of Essex Property rallied 4.7% and closed at $227.94 on Feb 9.Quarter in DetailDuring the reported quarter, Essex Property’s same-property gross revenues grew 3.0% from the prior-year quarter, while same-property net operating income (NOI) improved 3.4% year over year. Financial occupancies of 96.8% expanded 20 basis points (bps) year over year.Further, the company sold two communities for a total contract price of $160.3 million during the quarter. On the other hand, the company acquired one community for a total contract price of $59.0 million.LiquidityEssex Property exited year-end 2017 with cash and cash equivalents, including restricted cash, of $61.1 million, down from $170.3 million at the end of 2016.Notably, in January 2018, the company made an amendment to its unsecured line of credit facility, thereby enhancing the maximum amount available for borrowing from $1.0 billion to $1.2 billion as well as lengthening the maturity to December 2021. As of Feb 2, 2018, the company had around $891.0 million in undrawn capacity on its unsecured credit facilities.During the fourth quarter, the company issued 33,571 shares of common stock at an average price of $261.19 through its equity distribution program for net proceeds of $8.7 million. For full year 2017, the company issued 345,444 shares of common stock at an average price of $260.38. This helped generate net proceeds of $89.1 million.OutlookEssex Property provided its guidance for first-quarter and full-year 2018. For the full year, the company projects core FFO per share in the range of $12.24- $12.64. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is currently pegged at $12.42.The full-year 2018 projection is backed by expectations for same-property revenue growth in the band of 2.0-3.0% and same-property NOI increase in the range of 1.6-3.4%.For first-quarter 2018, the company projects core FFO per share in the $2.99-$3.09 band. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is currently pegged at $3.05.ConclusionWe are encouraged with the better-than-expected performance in terms of FFO per share of Essex Property in the reported quarter but slightly disappointed with the revenue miss. With a strong property base and solid balance sheet, Essex Property is likely to leverage on favorable demographic trends in its markets.

The figure also compared favorably with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $555.2 million.Results highlight growth in average rental rates. Additionally, economic occupancy managed to increase slightly in the quarter. The company also announced a hike in quarterly dividend.For full-year 2017, core FFO per share came in at $8.62, up 5.3% from the prior-year tally of $8.19. This was backed by 5.5% year-over-year growth in total revenues to nearly $2.2 billion.Quarter in Detail   For the reported quarter, average rental rates were up 2.1% year over year, while economic occupancy inched up 0.1% from the year-ago quarter.Revenues from established communities — those that stabilized operations as of Jan 1, 2016, are neither executing nor planning any significant redevelopment work and are not held for sale or planned for disposition within the current year — improved 2.2% year over year, indicating increase in average rental rates and economic occupancy.However, operating expenses for established communities flared up 2.7% on a year-over-year basis. Consequently, NOI from established communities rose 2.0% year over year to around $282.7 million.Notably, in the fourth quarter, the company acquired 850 Boca (containing 370 apartment homes), in Boca Raton, FL, for $138.0 million. The purchase denoted the company's entry into the Southeast Florida metropolitan region.As of Dec 31, 2017, AvalonBay had 21 communities under construction (expected to contain in total 6,544 apartment homes and 97,000 square feet of retail space), which are anticipated to be accomplished for an estimated total capital cost of $2.9 billion.

The new dividend will be paid on Apr 16 to stockholders of record on Mar 29, 2018.In ConclusionAvalonBay’s better-than-expected performance in the fourth quarter and the hike in dividend look encouraging. The company is well poised to grow on the back of its solid portfolio of high-quality assets in premium locations. Furthermore, the company has a healthy balance sheet. Nevertheless, there is presence of elevated supply in a number of the company’s markets. Hence, growth in its stabilized portfolio is likely to remain modest in the upcoming period. Rate hike remains another concern.AvalonBay currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

17,AVB,"We are in the heart of the Q4 reporting cycle and the real estate investment trust (REIT) space is buzzing with activity. In fact, there are a number of Q4 earnings releases queued for this week, of which AvalonBay Communities, Inc. (AVB  -  Free Report), Simon Property Group, Inc. (SPG  -  Free Report), Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. (MAA  -  Free Report) and Duke Realty Corporation (DRE  -  Free Report) will release quarterly numbers on Jan 31.No doubt, the December rate hike and possibilities of further increases in rates this year have kept investors in the REIT space worried to some extent. However, with underlying asset categories and the location of properties playing a crucial role in determining the performance of REITs, not all players in the space have equal chances to excel or fall behind.Going by numbers, per a study by the commercial real estate services’ firm — CBRE Group Inc.  — the overall U.S. office vacancy rate expanded 10 basis points (bps) to 13.0% during fourth-quarter 2017 amid an uptick in supply. Nevertheless, the national office vacancy rate still hovers near its post-recession low and vacancy continues to drop in majority of the U.S. office markets. Moreover, solid demand, recovering economy and job market, strengthening e-commerce market and healthy manufacturing environment are helping the industrial asset category to grab attention.Further, per a study by the real estate technology and analytics firm — RealPage, Inc. (RP  -  Free Report) — the U.S. apartment market reported moderate rent growth for the calendar year 2017 and seasonal pricing cuts in the fourth quarter. While U.S. apartment rents increased at a modest rate of 2.5% in 2017, effective rents for new leases edged down 0.9% during the quarter. However, national apartment occupancy came in at 95.1% at the end of the quarter, remaining stable year over year.Finally, mall traffic has been severely affected and retail landlords have consequently felt the heat due to consumers’ preferences inclining more and more toward online retail. However, retail REITs are putting in every effort to boost productivity of malls, by trying to grab attention from new and productive tenants, and disposing the non-productive ones. Retail REITs have been avoiding heavy dependence on apparel and accessories, but expanding dining options, opening movie theaters and offering recreational facilities to boost traffic. However, the upfront costs associated with such efforts are likely to limit near term margin improvement.Per our latest Earnings Preview, overall earnings for the Finance sector, of which REITs are part, are expected to be up 8.4% year over year on 2.4% higher revenues. This represents the Q4 earnings and revenue expectations for the sector as a whole — i.e. after combining the reported actual results with the still-to-come estimates.Therefore, surprises might be in store for some REITs, while others might disappoint this earnings season. So let’s have a close look at the factors that will impact the above-mentioned REITs’ fourth-quarter results.Residential REIT — AvalonBay Communities — is well poised to grow on the back of rising demand from household formation and favorable demographics. Also, increasing consumer confidence backed by job growth, higher wages and a healthier balance sheet promise bright prospects for this Arlington, VA-based REIT.In fact, the company is also likely to continue experiencing high occupancy. Although the pace of rental growth has slowed down from the prior years, it is now likely to achieve stability. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter revenues is currently pegged at $555.2 million, denoting an expected increase of 7.1% year over year. Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for funds from operations (FFO) per share in the soon-to-be-reported quarter is pegged at $2.24, indicating a 5.7% increase year over year.However, the fourth quarter is seasonally sluggish. Moreover, there is presence of elevated supply in quite a few of the company’s markets. In addition, there is high concession activity amid elevated supply, which remains a concern. (Read more: AvalonBay to Post Q4 Earnings: What's in the Offing?)AvalonBay has a Zacks Rank # 3 (Hold) and Earnings ESP of -0.07%. Though the Zacks Rank is favorable, the negative ESP lowers chances of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Notably, in the preceding four quarters, the company surpassed estimates on one occasion and missed in the other three, as shown in the chart below:AvalonBay Communities, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  AvalonBay Communities, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | AvalonBay Communities, Inc. QuoteIndianapolis, IN-based retail real estate investment trust (REIT) — Simon Property Group — has been undertaking various initiatives, of late, to strengthen its relationship with customers. In addition, it is focusing on omni-channel strategies to gain popularity among retailers. Further, in the fourth quarter, the company initiated various programs and events to steer mall traffic.Nevertheless, with more and more consumers shifting to online purchases, mall traffic continues to remain considerably depressed. This has resulted in an increasing number of retailers joining the dot-com bandwagon. Also, retailers are reconsidering their footprint and opting for store closures. While Simon Property is making efforts to beat these retail blues through various initiatives, implementation of such measures requires a decent upfront cost. Consequently, this might impede any robust growth in the company’s profit margins in the quarter under review.Amid these, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth-quarter 2017 revenues is currently pegged at $1.4 billion — indicating projected growth of around 0.5% year over year. Moreover, The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter FFO per share is currently pegged at $3.12. (Read more: Will E-Retail Boom Mar Simon Property's Q4 Earnings?)Currently, the Earnings ESP for Simon Property is -0.10%. Also, its Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) further decreases the predictive power of ESP.Nonetheless, over the last four quarters, the company exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three occasions and missed in the other.

QuoteYou can see the complete list of today’s Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here.Memphis, TN-based residential REIT Mid-America Apartment Communities — commonly known as MAA — maintains a well-balanced portfolio in the Southeast and Southwest regions of the United States. Further, favorable demographics and strong job growth in target markets are anticipated to drive demand for MAA’s properties. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter total revenues is currently pegged at $386.3 million, denoting projected growth of 25.8% year over year.However, it should be noted that the fourth quarter is seasonally sluggish. In addition, supply of new units increased in a number of markets, including Dallas and Austin. Hence, any robust growth in its same-store portfolio is likely to remain restricted in the quarter to be reported. Also, high concession activity amid higher supply adds to its woes.As such, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share for the quarter is pegged at $1.48, projecting a 1.3% decrease year over year. (Read more: What to Expect From Mid-America Apartment Q4 Earnings?)Mid-America Apartment Communities carries a Zacks Rank of 3. Despite this favorable rank, the Earnings ESP of -2.31% lowers chances of an earnings beat.However, the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, which is depicted in the graph below:Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. QuoteIn recent years, Indianapolis, IN-based Duke Realty has made concerted efforts to enhance its industrial portfolio. This augurs well because the industrial-asset category has been grabbing attention as it is experiencing high demand, with the economy and job market displaying signs of recovery and the manufacturing environment remaining healthy.Moreover, to simplify the company’s business model and turn it into a leading domestic pure play industrial REIT, Duke Realty has made rigorous efforts to lower its suburban office assets. Subsequently, in May 2017, the company inked a deal to sell its medical office buildings (MOB) portfolio for a price of $2.8 billion.While such streamlining measures are a strategic fit for the long term, the near-term dilutive effect cannot be bypassed. In fact, such short-term impact will likely drag the company’s quarterly results. Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $175 million, indicating a decline of 14.3% year over year. Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth-quarter FFO per share of 30 cents denote a projected descend of 3.2% from a year ago.

18,AVB,"AvalonBay Communities, Inc. (AVB  -  Free Report) is slated to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Jan 31, after the market closes.Last quarter, this residential REIT witnessed a negative surprise of 3.10% in terms of funds from operations (FFO) per share.In the trailing four quarters, the company surpassed estimates on one occasion and missed in the other three. This resulted in an average negative surprise of 1.36%. The graph below depicts the surprise history of the company:AvalonBay Communities, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  AvalonBay Communities, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | AvalonBay Communities, Inc. QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderPer a study by the real estate technology and analytics firm, RealPage, Inc. (RP  -  Free Report), the U.S. apartment market reported moderate rent growth for the calendar year and seasonal pricing cuts in the fourth quarter. While U.S. apartment rents increased at a modest rate of 2.5% in 2017, effective rents for new leases edged down 0.9% during the quarter. Admittedly, the levels of rent growth have moderated from the earlier years. However, national apartment occupancy came in at 95.1% at the end of fourth-quarter 2017, remaining stable year over year.AvalonBay is well-poised to grow on the back of rising demand from household formation and favorable demographics. Also, increasing consumer confidence on the back of job growth, higher wages and a healthier balance sheet promise bright prospects for this Arlington, VA-based REIT.In fact, the company is also likely to continue experiencing high occupancy. Although the pace of rental growth has slowed down from the bygone years, it is now likely to achieve stability. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter revenues is currently pegged at $555.2 million, denoting an expected increase of 7.1% year over year.However, fourth quarter is seasonally the slower one. Moreover, there is presence of elevated supply in quite a few of the company’s markets. Hence, any robust growth in its stabilized portfolio is likely to remain restricted in the yet-to-be-reported quarter. In addition, there is high concession activity amid higher supply, which remains a concern.Additionally, prior to fourth-quarter earnings release, there is lack of any solid catalyst for raising optimism about the company’s business activities and prospects. As such, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share in the soon-to-be-reported quarter remained unchanged at $2.24, over the past month. Nevertheless, this indicates a 5.7% increase year over year.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that AvalonBay is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a bullish Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: AvalonBay has an Earnings ESP of -0.07%, representing the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: AvalonBay’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a few stocks in the REIT space that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to report a positive surprise this time around:CubeSmart (CUBE  -  Free Report), slated to release fourth-quarter results on Feb 15, has an Earnings ESP of +1.10% and a Zacks Rank of 3.

19,AVB,"Student Housing REIT American Campus Communities (ACC  -  Free Report) is anticipated to ride the growth curve driven by its superior development pipeline. In fact, in a recent video interview at REITworld 2017 with Nareit, the company’s CEO and co-founder — Bill Bayless — noted that the company is giving utmost priority to development activities.The company has a robust development pipeline that aggregates approximately $2 billion through 2019. The company has been a net buyer of student housing in the current year. It acquired around $800 million worth of assets in total, of which $591 million marks the buyout of a portfolio from affiliates of Core Spaces and DRW Real Estate Investments, according to Bayless.These acquisitions are in sync with the company’s strategy, and help it fortify presence in its current markets and also in Seattle. The developments and acquisitions are situated on or near to tier one universities. These are also anticipated to be conducive to earnings growth.This reputed owner, manager and developer of high-quality student housing communities in the United States has a total managed portfolio of 204 properties with approximately 131,300 beds. The company has achieved 12 consecutive years of internal growth in same-store rental rate, rental revenues, and net operating income, as well as 51 consecutive quarters of same-store revenue growth.Unlike residential REITs, including AvalonBay Communities, Inc. (AVB  -  Free Report) and Equity Residential (EQR  -  Free Report), rental units of which are open for leasing to all, student housing REITs like American Campus Communities and Education Realty Trust (EDR  -  Free Report), which is better known as EdR, lease their real estates to students. Hence, such real estates are generally required to be set up within or in places close to colleges and universities. Also, enrolment growth is a major driver for student housing assets.Moreover, with a $24,000 salary differential between college graduates and high-school graduates, college enrolment is set to increase and this will drive demand for residential units that are leased by student housing REITs. Also, there is pent-up demand for new, purpose-built student housing properties which have better amenities than old, outdated housing. Further, supply remains manageable.Apart from these, student housing REITs have decent opportunities to excel in the coming years as demand is emanating for on-campus developments from universities that are facing state budget cuts and low funds, and are incapable of developing or renovating the aging housing properties. And on-campus housing usually enjoys full occupancy.Shares of American Campus Communities have outperformed the industry it belongs to, in the past month. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s shares have inched up 1.7%, while the industry has incurred loss of 2.9% during the same time period.

22,AVB,"We will now tread into another busy week of the current reporting cycle and real estate investment trust (REIT) will buzz with activity on Monday itself.Among the factors that influenced the REIT space, a sluggish yet steady macroeconomic improvement is worth mentioning. This led to strong demand for a number of asset categories in third-quarter 2017. Though supply has been increasing, the pace has been modest in many of the asset categories.Going by numbers, per a study by the commercial real estate services’ firm, CBRE Group Inc. , the U.S. office vacancy rate declined to 12.9% in the third quarter amid growth in office-using jobs. In most of the U.S. office markets, vacancy declined, taking the national office vacancy rate close to its post-recession low.Moreover, according to a study by the real estate technology and analytics firm — RealPage, Inc. (RP  -  Free Report) — the U.S. apartment market recorded stable rent growth, while occupancy remained healthy in the third quarter. However, these growth levels have moderated from the previous years. For new leases, effective rents inched up 0.9% during the quarter and 2.6% annually. Further, apartment occupancy came in at 95.5% for the third quarter across the nation’s top 100 metros.However, mall traffic continues to suffer amid rapid shift in customers’ shopping preference through the online channel, resulting in an increasing number of retailers jumping on the dot com bandwagon. These have made retailers reconsider their footprint and eventually opt for store closures in recent times. Further, retailers unable to cope with competition have been filing bankruptcies. This is a pressing concern for retail REITs, as the trend has been considerably curtailing demand for the retail real estate space.Let us take a look at how the following REITs are placed ahead of their quarterly releases.Office REIT Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE  -  Free Report) focuses on Class A properties concentrated in urban campuses, primarily for the life science and technology entities. These locations are characterized by high barriers to entry and exit, and a limited supply of available space. This highly dynamic setting adds to the productivity and efficiency of the tenants, and will enable the company to enjoy steady rental revenues in the third quarter.However, a substantial development pipeline, currency fluctuations and stiff competition can affect Alexandria’s bottom-line growth in the quarter under review.Amid these, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues for the third quarter is currently pegged at $210.9 million. This reflects a decline of 8.5% as compared with the prior-year period. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for funds from operations (FFO) per share for the quarter is $1.50.Currently, the Earnings ESP for Alexandria is 0.00%. Moreover, it has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), which actually reduces the predictive power of ESP. (Read more: What to Expect from Alexandria's Q3 Earnings Report?)You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.For residential REIT AvalonBay Communities, Inc. (AVB  -  Free Report), there is an increasing apartment supply in a number of its markets. Hence, any robust growth in its stabilized portfolio is likely to remain restricted in the yet-to-be-reported quarter. Further, delay in construction activities in the development portfolio is anticipated to affect the company’s lease-up net operating income in the near term.Nevertheless, AvalonBay has a solid portfolio of high quality assets in premium locations as well as a healthy balance sheet. Also, increasing consumer confidence on the back of job growth and rising wages augur well for rental demand.Amid these, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter revenues is pegged at $538.5 million, denoting an expected increase of 4.3% year over year. Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share for the quarter is pegged at $2.26.However, AvalonBay has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and an Earnings ESP of -5.75%. This combination leaves our prediction inconclusive. (Read more: What's in the Offing for AvalonBay in Q3 Earnings?)On the other hand, residential REIT UDR Inc. (UDR  -  Free Report) boasts vast experience in the residential real estate market. The company has a superior portfolio in targeted U.S. markets and adheres to disciplined capital allocation. These are likely to drive results in the to-be-reported quarter.Specifically, the company is anticipated to benefit from favorable demographic trends. Along with this, the healthy job market is estimated to drive demand for apartments.However, we remain apprehensive about UDR Inc.’s performance as it has been dealing with escalating deliveries in a number of its markets. This remains a concern as elevated levels of supply curtail a landlord’s ability to demand higher rents and result in lesser absorption. As such, concession levels are likely to remain at the higher end, while pricing power of the company is expected to remain limited in the quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter revenues of UDR Inc. is pegged at $250.1 million, denoting estimated growth of 2.8% year over year. Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share for the quarter is pegged at 47 cents.At present, UDR Inc. has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. Though the Zacks Rank is favorable, we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings beat. (Read more: What's in the Offing for UDR Inc this Earnings Season?)Finally, diversified REIT Vornado Realty Trust (VNO  -  Free Report) has been actively repositioning its portfolio. In line with this, the company is involved in opportunistic acquisitions and divestitures, along with business spin-offs. In July, it completed the spin-off of its Washington, DC business. This made Vornado a New York-based office and retail REIT. Though such efforts to streamline business are commendable, the dilutive effects of these moves cannot be ignored.Subsequently, we anticipate a fall in the company’s total revenues in the to-be-reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues for the third quarter is currently pegged at $527.8 million. This reflects a decline of 16.7% from the prior-year quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share is currently pegged at 72 cents.At present, Vornado has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of -16.7%. Though the company has a favorable Zacks Rank, the negative ESP lowers chances of an earnings beat.

23,AVB,"Apartment Investment and Management Company (AIV  -  Free Report) — better known as Aimco — reported third-quarter 2017 pro forma funds from operations (FFO) of 63 cents per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a cent. The figure also indicates a 14.5% increase from the year-ago quarter tally of 55 cents.Results display growth in property net operating income (NOI) supported by same-store properties, and lease-up of redevelopment and acquisition communities. The company also benefited from reduced overhead costs. However, this positive was partially offset by the loss of income from apartment sales in 2016.Total revenues of $254.6 million comfortably outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $249.2 million. In addition, the reported figure came in 2.3% higher than the prior-year quarter tally of $248.9 million.Quarter in DetailSame-store revenues increased 2.8% year over year to $148.2 million, while expenses edged down 1.1% year over year to $42.3 million. Consequently, same-store net operating income (NOI) climbed 4.5% to $105.9 million on a year-over-year basis.Same-store average daily occupancy expanded 20 basis point (bps) year over year to 96.0%. Rental rates on new leases were up 1.4% and on renewals were up 4.5% from the expiring lease rates.As of Sep 30, 2017, Aimco held cash and restricted cash on hand of $86 million. Moreover, the estimated fair market value of the company’s unencumbered apartment communities came in at around $1.8 billion, marking denoting an increase of about 12% from the beginning of the year.Further, at the end of the quarter, Aimco’s outstanding borrowings on its revolving credit facility were $356 million and available capacity was $232 million, after considering $12 million of letters of credit backed by the facility.Portfolio ActivityDuring the reported quarter, Aimco invested $33 million in redevelopment and development.In addition, Aimco is revamping its portfolio through property sales and reinvesting the proceeds in select apartment homes with higher rents, superior margins and higher-than-expected growth.Through these efforts, the company increased its revenue per apartment home by 6% to $2,075. Additionally, it enhanced the quality and expected growth rate of its portfolio. Specifically, the percentage of A, B and C+ home came in at 53%, 34% and 13% in third-quarter 2017 compared with 51%, 37% and 12%, respectively, recorded in the year-ago quarter.    GuidanceFor fourth-quarter 2017, Aimco provided pro forma FFO per share guidance in the band of 60- 64 cents. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is 63 cents.For full-year 2017, the company narrowed its pro forma FFO per share guidance to $2.42-$2.46 from $2.40-$2.48 provided earlier. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is $2.44.The company’s full-year guidance is backed by same-store revenue growth assumptions of 3.10-3.50% and NOI increase of 4.00-4.50%.DividendOn Oct 25, Aimco announced a quarterly cash dividend of 36 cents per share of Class A Common Stock for the third quarter. This marks a 9% year-over-year increase. The dividend will be paid on Nov 30 to stockholders of record as of Nov 17, 2017.Bottom LineAimco’s efforts to reposition its portfolio by shedding non-strategic properties and investing the proceeds in opportunistic acquisitions will likely drive long-term growth. In addition to this, the company has a solid portfolio diversified both in terms of geography and price point. This is likely to help it meet the rise in demand for apartment properties efficiently.However, stiff competition from new supply in various markets is expected to dampen Aimco’s rent growth and new lease pricing ability. Additionally, interest rate hike and dilutive effects of sale of assets remain concerns.Aimco currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The stock has lost 4.7% year to date, as against 4.5% growth recorded by the industry it belongs to. We now look forward to the earnings releases of other residential REITs like AvalonBay Communities, Inc. (AVB  -  Free Report), UDR Inc. (UDR  -  Free Report) and Essex Property Trust Inc. (ESS  -  Free Report).

24,AVB,"Public Storage’s (PSA  -  Free Report) third-quarter 2017 core funds from operations (FFO) per share of $2.61 marked a 3.2% growth from the prior year quarter figure of $2.53. The Zacks Consensus Estimate was $2.60.Results mirror an improvement in net operating income (NOI) from both same-store and non-same store facilities. Higher realized annual rent per occupied square foot supported the company’s same-store performance. Also, Public Storage benefited from its expansion efforts.Quarterly revenues of $686.4 million also climbed 3.5% from the prior year quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same was $685 million.Public Storage Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Public Storage Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Public Storage QuoteNote: The EPS numbers presented in the above chart represent funds from operations (“FFO”) per share.Moreover, the company recorded a total $7.8 million casualty loss because of damaged buildings and equipment, together with expenses for repairs, cleanup, and disposal. Further, it anticipates incurring around $10.0 million of capital expenditures for completion of the hurricane-damage repair. The loss projections are below its insurance deductibles.Behind the HeadlinesSame-store revenues advanced 2.4% year over year to $564.4 million during the third quarter, while the company’s NOI climbed 2.6% to $416.9 million. The increase in same-store revenues was primarily driven by a 3.4% rise in realized annual rental income per occupied square feet to $17.52. However, the weighted-average square foot occupancy of 94.5% contracted 80 basis points year over year.In addition, the company’s NOI from non-same store facilities grew on the back of the 321 self-storage facilities acquired, developed or expanded since January 2015.Portfolio ActivityIn the reported quarter, Public Storage bought seven self-storage facilities, comprising 0.4 million net rentable square feet, for $47.3 million. Following the quarter end, the company acquired or was under contract to acquire eight self-storage facilities, spanning 0.5 million net rentable square feet of space, for $67.8 million.Finally, as of Sep 30, 2017, the company had several facilities in development (2.8 million net rentable square feet), with an estimated cost of $365 million, as well as expansion projects (1.9 million net rentable square feet) worth roughly $235 million. Public Storage estimates to incur the remaining $378 million of development costs related to these projects mainly over the next 18 months.LiquidityPublic Storage exited third-quarter 2017 with around $694.2 million of cash and cash equivalents, up from $183.7 million recorded at the end of the prior year.DividendOn Oct 25, Public Storage’s board of trustees announced a regular quarterly dividend of $2.00 per share. The amount will be paid on Dec 28 to shareholders of record as of Dec 13, 2017.In ConclusionPublic Storage is one of the largest owners and operators of storage facilities in the United States. The company’s acquisition and expansion efforts look promising. Nevertheless, rising supply in a number of its markets is a headwind. Rate hike also remains a concern for the company.Public Storage currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

26,AVB,"AvalonBay Communities, Inc. (AVB  -  Free Report) is slated to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 30, after the market closes.Last quarter, this residential REIT delivered a negative surprise of 2.34% in terms of funds from operations (“FFO”) per share.In the trailing four quarters, the company surpassed estimates on one occasion and missed in the other three. This resulted in an average negative surprise of 0.7%. The graph below depicts the surprise history of the company:AvalonBay Communities, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  AvalonBay Communities, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | AvalonBay Communities, Inc. QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderAvalonBay is well-poised to grow on the back of a rising demand from household formation and favorable demographics. Also, increasing consumer confidence on the back of job growth, rising wages and a healthier balance sheet, promise strong prospects for this Arlington, VA-based REIT.Notably, per a study by the real estate technology and analytics firm, RealPage, Inc. (RP  -  Free Report), the U.S. apartment market reported stable rent growth, while occupancy remained healthy in the third quarter. However, the levels of rent growth have moderated from the previous years. For new leases, effective rents inched up 0.9% during the quarter and 2.6%, annually. Further, apartment occupancy came in at 95.5% for the third quarter across the country’s top 100 metros.AvalonBay is also likely to continue experiencing high occupancy. Although the pace of rental growth has slowed down from the bygone years, it is now likely to achieve stability.However, there is presence of elevated supply in quite a few of the company’s markets. Hence, any robust growth in its stabilized portfolio is likely to remain restricted in the yet-to-be-reported quarter. Further, delay in construction activities in the development portfolio is anticipated to affect the company’s lease-up net operating income in the near term.However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter revenues is pegged at $538.5 million, denoting an expected increase of 4.3% year over year.Additionally, prior to third-quarter earnings release, there is lack of any solid catalyst for raising overt optimism about the company’s business activities and prospects. As such, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share in the soon-to-be-reported quarter remained unchanged at $2.26, over the past month.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that AvalonBay is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a bullish Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: AvalonBay has an Earnings ESP of -5.63%, representing the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: AvalonBay’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a few stocks worth considering in the REIT sector, which contain the right combination of elements to deliver a positive surprise this quarter:CoreSite Realty Corp. (COR  -  Free Report), slated to release third-quarter results on Oct 26, has an Earnings ESP of +1.19% and a Zacks Rank #2.

27,AVB,"Equity Residential (EQR  -  Free Report) reported third-quarter 2017 normalized funds from operations (FFO) per share of 80 cents, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. The figure came in higher than 78 cents reported in the year-ago quarter.Results mirror enhanced same-store net operating income (NOI) and lease-up NOI. However, the company experienced adverse impact on NOI, primarily stemming from its 2016 and 2017 transaction activity. Also, it incurred elevated interest expense and higher corporate overhead in the quarter.Moreover, total revenues in the reported quarter came in at $624.1 million, indicating 3.0% growth from the prior-year period. In addition, the figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $619.6 million.Per management, steady rental demand during peak leasing period helped deliver solid occupancy, retention and renewal pricing. This assisted in alleviating the impact from high supply in the company’s markets.Equity Residential now expects to deliver same-store revenue growth at the upper end of its original projections for the year. Also, with the latest favorable real estate tax appeals, the company anticipates generating same-store NOI growth at the upper end of its initial expectations.Quarter in DetailSame-store revenues (includes 72,049 apartment units) were up 2.2% year over year to $587.1 million, while expenses climbed 1.7% year over year to $173.8 million. As a result, same-store NOI advanced 2.4% year over year to $413.3 million.The company experienced 2.1% growth in average rental rate to $2,709. Occupancy expanded 20 basis points from the year-ago quarter to 96.2% for same-store portfolio.The company exited third-quarter 2017 with cash and cash equivalents of around $46.6 million, up from $37.7 million recorded at the end of the prior quarter.Portfolio ActivityDuring the reported quarter, Equity Residential acquired three consolidated apartment properties in Boston, Los Angeles and Bellevue, WA, comprising 811 apartment units, for around $411.0 million. On the other hand, the company sold one consolidated apartment property in San Diego (120 apartment units) for $53 million.OutlookFor fourth-quarter 2017, Equity Residential projects normalized FFO per share in the range of 79-83 cents. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is currently pegged at 81 cents.The company revised its projections for full-year 2017 same-store operating performance and FFO per share. It now estimates normalized FFO per share in the $3.10-$3.14 range compared with the prior guidance of $3.08-$3.14. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.11 lies within this range.For the same-store portfolio, the company revised expectations for physical occupancy to 95.9% from 95.8% and revenue growth to 2.2% from the previously guided range of 1.75-2.25%. Also, expense is projected to flare up 3.2% against the prior range of 3.25-4.0%, while NOI is estimated to be up 1.8% compared with the previous range of 0.75-1.75%.  Our ViewpointEquity Residential’s better-than-expected performance in the third quarter is impressive. The company is anticipated to benefit from its efforts to reposition the portfolio in high barrier-to-entry/core markets, favorable demographics, lifestyle transformation and creation of new households. The company’s current focus is on the acquisition and development of assets primarily in the six core coastal metropolitan areas — Boston, New York, Washington D.C., Southern California, San Francisco and Seattle.

28,AVB,"The U.S. apartment supply remains elevated and there seems to be no respite any time soon. While fourth-quarter 2017 was earlier projected to be the peak period for deliveries, delays stemming from labor shortage and escalating costs continue to push the delivery schedule to 2018.According to the apartment pipeline data from Axiometrics, a RealPage Inc. (RP  -  Free Report) company, for an estimated 56,186 units, delivery has been postponed to the next year, up from 50,658 units delayed from 2016 to 2017, and 14,805 units from 2015 to 2016. Particularly, the numbers of projects, the completion dates of which are changing to 2018 from 2017, are escalating “week by week, month by month.”The delayed figure has been based on a formula using prior year’s delay percentage as a base. Particularly, Dallas, New York and Houston are slated to have “most units delayed into 2018.” These are also the metros with the maximum marked supply for 2017, per that report.Moreover, data, as of Sep 18, suggests expected deliveries of around 370,582 new units for full-year 2017, reflecting a decline of about 11,655 units from the Aug 21 projections. This reveals a shift of deliveries to 2018. Along with new construction starts, identified supply for 2018 climbed 16,729 units and has now reached 298,068 units.This could cast a pall on residential REIT stocks like AvalonBay Communities, Inc. (AVB  -  Free Report), Equity Residential (EQR  -  Free Report) and Essex Property Trust Inc. (ESS  -  Free Report). In fact, performance of residential REITs over the last few quarters has already been affected by elevated level of supply of new units. Now, the anticipation of a continuation of the stressed environment into 2018 is also likely to impact the occupancy levels, as well as landlords’ ability to command more rents and concession levels.In addition, with some of the residential REITs’ development deliveries running behind schedule amid a delay in construction activities, lease-up net operating income is expected to be adversely affected in the near term.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

29,AVB,"Education Realty Trust (EDR  -  Free Report) — better known as EdR — announced the opening a new third-party residence hall development in the Commerce-based Texas A&M University.The residence hall, spanning 137,000 square feet, will house first-year college students to foster a sense of community. It has 490 accommodations in single- and double-bed formats. In addition, the housing community has amenities including centralized private bathroom, laundry facilities, high-speed Internet and Wi-Fi facilities, and several communal spaces. This newly opened student housing facility will likely stand out as an excellent learning hub and improve the collegiate experience for the students. As the student enrolment rate has multiplied manifold over the past decade, this new residence hall will enable the university to provide more on-campus housing facilities for students.Education Realty is one of the largest developer, owner and manager of student housing communities in the United States. In 2017, the company is set to deliver third-party developments worth nearly $100 million, adding around $300 million to its own asset portfolio.Moreover, student housing REITs have decent opportunities to excel in the coming years, as demand has been emanating for on-campus developments from universities that are facing state-budget cuts and low funds. As a result, these universities are incapable of developing or renovating the ageing housing properties.Encouragingly, EdR’s senior unsecured debt and shelf ratings were recently upgraded by a notch from Baa3 to Baa2 by Moody's Investor Services. The rating agency also upgraded EdR’s preferred equity shelf rating from Ba1 to Baa3.Unlike residential REITs, including AvalonBay Communities (AVB  -  Free Report), Preferred Apartment Communities (APTS  -  Free Report) and Equity Lifestyle Properties (ELS  -  Free Report), the rental units of which are open for leasing to all, student housing REITs lease real estates to students. Hence, such real estates are generally required to be set up within or at places close to colleges and universities, and usually enjoy full occupancy. 4 Stocks to Watch after the Massive Equifax HackCybersecurity stocks spiked on recent news of a data breach affecting 143 million Americans.

30,AVB,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for AvalonBay Communities, Inc. (AVB  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 3% in that time frame, underperforming the market.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.AvalonBay's Q2 FFO Lags Estimates, Revenues Up Y/YAvalonBay’s second-quarter 2017 core FFO per share of $2.09 missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.14. Total revenue of $530.5 million managed to marginally exceed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $529.5 million.Nevertheless, core FFO per share recorded 3.0% growth from the year-ago figure of $2.03. Results reflect growth in NOI from existing, acquired and newly developed operating communities.Also, total revenue increased 5.6% year over year as revenues from development communities and stabilized operating communities witnessed growth.Quarter in Detail   For the quarter, average rental rates were up 2.5% year over year, with the highest growth in the Pacific North West portfolio (5.1%), followed by the South California (3.9%) and New England (2.7%) portfolios. However, economic occupancy remained unchanged at 95.4%.Revenues from established communities – those that stabilized operations as of Jan 1, 2016 and are neither executing nor planning any significant redevelopment work during the current year – improved 2.5% year over year, indicating increase in average rental rates.However, operating expenses for established communities flared up 3.5% on a year-over-year basis. Consequently, NOI from established communities rose 2.1% year over year to nearly $277 million.As of Jun 30, 2017, AvalonBay had 23 communities under construction (expected to contain 6,965 apartment homes in total), which are anticipated to be completed for an estimated total capital cost of around $3.2 billion. This includes the company's share of communities being developed through joint ventures.Liquidity PositionAs of Jun 30, 2017, AvalonBay had $105.0 million outstanding under its $1.5-billion unsecured credit facility. The company had around $293.2 million in unrestricted cash and cash in escrow as of that date. Moreover, the company’s annualized net debt-to-core EBITDA for second-quarter 2017 was 5.0 times.OutlookFor the third quarter, AvalonBay expects core FFO per share in the range of $2.14–$2.20.For full-year 2017, the company projects core FFO per share in the band of $8.50–$8.70.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?Following the release, investors have witnessed an upward trend in fresh estimates.

31,AVB,"Residential REIT AvalonBay Communities, Inc. (AVB  -  Free Report) recently forayed into the Denver metropolitan area with the acquisition of a 252-unit apartment home community — The Lodge Denver West — which was completed in 2016. The company acquired this property in Lakewood, CO, for around $76.8 million.Per AvalonBay’s management, “Denver shares many of the best characteristics” which are possessed by the established core markets of the company. In addition, the region has grabbed the attention of well educated workers in knowledge-based industries. This makes the acquisition a strategic fit for AvalonBay which intends to fortify its presence in this region on the back of buyouts and new development activity.Notably, the Denver metro area has been experiencing solid rent growth, thus AvalonBay’s decision to enter this market area will likely prove beneficial. Per The Denver Post news, that cited the Denver Metro Apartment Vacancy and Rent report from the University of Denver’s Daniels College of Business and Colorado Economic and Management Associates, average monthly rent for the second quarter increased $36.98 to $1,419.74, leading to a new rental high.More importantly, while 2,152 new units were added to the market in the quarter, 4,348 apartments were filled. Also, vacancy rate edged down to 5% from 5.7% in the second quarter, reflecting solid demand for rental units amid low unemployment rate.Overall for AvalonBay, amid favorable demographics and decent demand in its markets, the company is well poised to grow, backed by its solid portfolio of high quality assets in premium locations. The company also has a healthy balance sheet. However, there is presence of elevated supply in a number of its markets. Hence, growth in its stabilized portfolio is likely to remain restricted in the upcoming period. Further, delay in construction activities in the development portfolio is expected to affect the company’s lease-up net operating in the near term.AvalonBay currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Shares of the company have gained 5.3% year to date, underperforming the industry’s rally of 7.3%.Stocks to ConsiderBetter-ranked stocks in the real estate space include Equity LifeStyle Properties, Inc.

32,AVB,"The U.S. apartment supply remains elevated, with fourth-quarter 2017 projected to be the peak period for deliveries. However, delays resulting from labor shortage and escalating costs could push the peak season to first-quarter 2018, as expected completion dates of a number of projects are changing to early 2018 from late 2017.Per the apartment pipeline data from Axiometrics, a RealPage Inc. (RP  -  Free Report) company, the Houston market is likely to experience a significant decline in new units in 2018, while Dallas, Atlanta, Denver and Austin markets are anticipated to see a moderation in supply. However, the Washington, DC and Los Angeles markets are likely to witness upswing in construction, while new units in New York and Seattle markets are expected to hover near the 2017 levels.This could cast a pall on residential REIT stocks like AvalonBay Communities, Inc. (AVB  -  Free Report), Equity Residential (EQR  -  Free Report) and Essex Property Trust Inc. (ESS  -  Free Report).Notably, the delay in deliveries has been quite evident in the last few quarters. In fact, per a recent report from Axiometrics, 103,861 new units are marked for delivery in the third quarter, while 117,866 new units are projected to be up in the market in the fourth quarter, according to the survey as of Aug 21. This is in contrast to the data as of May 22, which estimated delivery of 112,856 units in the third quarter and 109,333 in the fourth.The figures clearly illustrate a decrease of around 9,000 units in the third-quarter schedule, thanks to the delays, and an addition of around 8,500 units to the fourth-quarter roster. The third- and fourth-quarter new unit numbers are also higher than the projections in the first of the year, when they were estimated to be 73,748 in the third quarter and 65,688 in the fourth quarter.Moreover, data as of Aug 21 suggests expected deliveries of around 381,237 new units for full-year 2017, reflecting a decline of about 13,300 units from the May 22 projections. This reveals a shift of deliveries to 2018. Along with new construction starts, identified supply for 2018 climbed and has now reached 281,139 units. Although the figure is below the anticipated volume of 2017, it is fast reaching the 2016 aggregate, and has exceeded the 2015 and 2014 tallies.Elevated supply has already affected the performance of residential REITs over the last few quarters. The anticipation of a stressed environment in the near term is also likely to affect their ability to command more rents and concession levels. Further, with some of the residential REITs’ development deliveries running behind schedule amid a delay in construction activities, lease-up net operating income is expected to be adversely affected in the near term.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

33,AVB,"Education Realty Trust (EDR), commonly known as EdR, is making every effort to leverage on the soaring demand for on-campus development of universities. Recently, the company opened the first phase of its ONE Plan on-campus replacement housing at the Northern Michigan University (NMU).This development, named The Woods in Marquette, MI, has 417 beds in a living-learning community. The property boasts ample amenities, including Internet and Wi-Fi, classrooms, study rooms, TV lounges and laundry facilities. The entire $75.4-million project is, however, slated for final delivery in 2018. The development will include 1,229 beds.EdR is leasing the land from the university, and the project will be funded through EdR’s On Campus Equity Plan — The ONE Plan. The plan helps in funding projects on university land with this student housing REIT’s equity and financial flexibility. On the other hand, such partnerships allow the university to channelize its finances and organizational resources for other projects, and campus improvement measures.Notably, student housing REITs have decent opportunities to excel over the long term, as demand has been shooting up for on-campus developments from universities which are battling state budget cuts and low funds, and are incapable of developing or renovating the ageing housing properties. Also, on-campus housing usually enjoys full occupancy, thus ensuring steady cash flow for the student housing REIT.EdR is one of the largest developer, owner and manager of student housing communities in the nation. In 2017, the company is set to deliver third-party developments worth nearly $100 million, adding around $300 million to its own asset portfolio.In sync with its efforts to capitalize on the growing demand for on-campus facilities, recently, EdR announced the completion and unveiling of Sycamore Suites, the new on-campus residence hall of East Stroudsburg University of Pennsylvania. The newly opened hall encloses two- and four-person suites, accommodating 496 beds.

34,AVB,"In a notable development, recently the single-family rental housing REITs – Invitation Homes Inc. (INVH  -  Free Report) and Starwood Waypoint Homes  – announced their agreement to merge in an all-stock deal. The transaction is likely to be accretive to core funds from operations (“FFO”) on a run-rate basis and the combined company’s shares are expected to trade under the ticker symbol for Invitation Homes – INVH – on the NYSE.The move is a strategic fit with the combined operation likely to benefit by leveraging economies of scale. It would have a portfolio of 82,000 single-family homes and average of 4,800 homes per market. The substantial portfolio overlap is anticipated to drive $45–$50 million in annual synergies, per the company’s press release. Moreover, in second-quarter 2017, the combined company experienced pro forma same-store net operating income (NOI) growth of 7.0% with more than 95% occupancy, reflecting the solid demand for the properties.According to the deal terms, each Starwood Waypoint Homes share will be converted into 1.614 Invitation Homes shares, based on a fixed exchange ratio. Following the transaction closure, Invitation Homes’ stockholders would enjoy 59% ownership of the combined company’s stock, with Starwood Waypoint Homes’ stockholders owning the residual.Based on the closing prices of Starwood Waypoint Homes’ shares and Invitation Homes’ common stock on Aug 9, 2017, the day prior to the disclosure about the merger, the equity market capitalization of the combined company would be around $11 billion. Moreover, the total enterprise value, including debt, would be about $20 billion. Fred Tuomi – CEO of Starwood Waypoint Homes – will take charge as the CEO of Invitation Homes, while Bryce Blair, the present chairman of Invitation Homes, will assume position of chairman of the combined entity.However, this transaction, expected to close by this year end, will result in a fall in private equity firm Blackstone’s ownership stake in the combined company to 41% from 70% in the current, stand-alone Invitation Homes. Notably, Invitation Homes was founded by Blackstone in 2012 and went public earlier this year.Unlike apartment REITs like Equity Residential (EQR  -  Free Report) and AvalonBay Communities, Inc. (AVB  -  Free Report) who lease several units in a single building, single family rental housing REITs cater to the demand of renters who prefer to have a yard and avoid sharing walls with neighbors. Such REITs have been grabbing much limelight, of late, and experiencing decent gains as well. The merger of this scale is likely to drive such merger deals in the market, moving ahead.Zacks' 10-Minute Stock-Picking SecretSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.

35,AVB,"Education Realty Trust (EDR  -  Free Report) announced the delivery of Lewis Hall Honors College and University Flats to the University of Kentucky, completing the extensive on-campus revitalization development.University Flats will house graduate, professional and upper-level undergraduate students in separate living communities. The seven-story building encloses 771 beds in 312 apartments. These constructions range from studio formats to four-bedroom apartments. Each apartment has a kitchen and is well furnished.On the other hand, the compounds of Lewis Honors College will accommodate 350 students to foster a live-learn environment. With the university’s top-tier students housed in it, the compound can stand out as a learning hub.In 2011, the University of Kentucky entered into a partnership with Education Realty Trust to construct, finance and manage its on-campus housing revitalization program. The company constructed approximately 200 learning spaces and 6,850 new beds to create a progressive campus.According to Eric N. Monday, the university's executive vice president for finance and administration, these housing compounds will focus on the success of students ‘through modern, technology-rich living spaces that foster a sense of community’.This project has improved the recruiting and retention rates for the university, in addition to student success. The project, worth $450 million, has been executed in five phases. It was entirely funded through Education Realty’s On-Campus Equity Plan – The ONE PlanSM – giving the university access to a single trusted partner. While Education Realty has been given a long-term lease to maintain and manage these communities, the university will provide residential life for the remaining part of the 75-year ground lease.Unlike residential REITs, including AvalonBay Communities, Inc.

37,AVB,"The current reporting cycle has already crossed the half-way mark and results are still pouring in from the real estate investment trust (REIT) industry. In fact, on Aug 2, a number of S&P 500 constituents – residential REIT AvalonBay Communities, Inc. (AVB  -  Free Report), data center REIT Equinix, Inc. (EQIX  -  Free Report), and retail REITs Federal Realty Investment Trust (FRT  -  Free Report), GGP Inc. (GGP  -  Free Report), The Macerich Company (MAC  -  Free Report) – are slated to release quarterly figures.So far, results from the broader market revealed broad-based growth, record earnings tally, an abundance of positive surprises and favorable trends on the revisions front. (Read more: Q2 Earnings Season Past the Halfway Mark)Nevertheless, the performance of the REIT sector has so far been mixed, with results from some of the top notch REIT stocks either matching estimates or beating, and a few others falling shy of expectations.Admittedly, rate hike and cautious approach of investors have deterred gains from this industry so far this year. However, with underlying asset categories and the location of properties playing a crucial role in determining the performance of REITs, not all players in the space have equally excelled or fallen behind.In fact, defying concerns about supply in the market, the residential real estate market is back with a bang, driven by robust demand levels. Per a study by the real estate technology and analytics firm, RealPage, Inc. (RP  -  Free Report), the second-quarter demand level of 175,645 apartments across the nation marked one-third increase from the level witnessed a year ago. This helped occupancy to remain high at 95.0% as of mid-year and led to stabilization in the annual pace of rent growth, which came in at 3.6%, close to 3.7% growth experienced in the first quarter. Notably, job formation and checked move-outs for buying homes acted as the catalyst.Moreover, with growth in cloud computing, Internet of Things and big data, and an increasing number of companies opting for third-party IT infrastructure, data center REITs are experiencing a boom market. In fact, demand has been outpacing supply in top tier data center markets. Despite enjoying high occupancy, these markets are absorbing new construction at a faster pace.On the other hand, we note that mall traffic continues to decline owing to a change in shopping patterns. Online purchases have taken precedence over in-store purchase. This has forced retailers to reconsider their strategy and shift investments from traditional retailing to online channels and optimize their brick-and-mortar presence.While it is quite normal for retailers to do so, these optimization efforts and the consequent decision to close stores by a number of reputable retailers like Macy’s Inc. (M  -  Free Report), Sears Holdings Corporation (SHLD) and JC Penney (JCP) in recent months, have raised concerns over cash flows of mall landlords. Also, retailers unable to cope with competition have been filing bankruptcies. This is resulting in higher vacancy in existing malls.    Therefore, not all players in the REIT space are equally poised to excel this time around. To predict that, we rely on the Zacks methodology, combining a favorable Zacks Rank – Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) – and a positive Earnings ESP. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Per our proprietary methodology, Earnings ESP shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Research shows that with this combination of rank and ESP, chances of a positive earnings surprise are as high as 70% for the stocks.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Let’s have a look at what’s in store for the five REITs set to release second-quarter results on Wednesday:Arlington, VA-based, residential REIT AvalonBay is well poised to grow on the back of a rising demand from household formation and favorable demographics. In addition, increasing consumer confidence, on the back of job growth, rising wages, and a healthier balance sheet, promise bright prospects for the company. The company is likely to continue experiencing high occupancy. Although pace of rental growth has slowed down from the previous years, it is now likely to achieve stability. (Read more: Can AvalonBay Pull Off A Surprise in Q2 Earnings?)AvalonBay has an Earnings ESP of +0.94 %. This positive ESP combined with its Zacks Rank #3, increases the chances of a positive surprise this season.Over the trailing four quarters, with respect to FFO per share, the company surpassed estimates in one occasion and missed in the other three. This resulted in an average negative surprise of 0.84%. The graph below depicts the surprise history of the company:AvalonBay Communities, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  AvalonBay Communities, Inc.

The company operates across various geographical regions and its increasing popularity among major tech industry players looking for data management will likely drive revenues in the second quarter.However, we remain slightly cautious about the huge capital outlays, which may dent Equinix’s second-quarter profitability.

39,AVB,"AvalonBay Communities, Inc. (AVB  -  Free Report) is slated to report second-quarter 2017 results after the market closes on Aug 2.Last quarter, this Arlington, VA-based, residential real estate investment trust (“REIT”) witnessed a negative surprise of 0.95% in terms of funds from operations (“FFO”) per share. Results reflect growth in net operating income (“NOI”) from existing, acquired and newly developed operating communities. However, the company experienced a rise in interest expense.Over the trailing four quarters, the company surpassed estimates in one occasion and missed in the other three. This resulted in an average negative surprise of 0.84%. The graph below depicts the surprise history of the company:AvalonBay Communities, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  AvalonBay Communities, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | AvalonBay Communities, Inc. QuoteNote: The EPS numbers presented in the above chart represent funds from operations (“FFO”) per share.However, AvalonBay’s shares have climbed 8.6% year to date, against the industry’s gain of 7.0%.Let’s see how things have shaped up for this announcement.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that AvalonBay is likely to beat on estimates because it has the right combination of two key ingredients. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) to beat estimates, and AvalonBay has the right mix.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP, which represents the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate of $2.16 and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.14, is +0.94%. This is a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive surprise.Zacks Rank: AvalonBay’s Zacks Rank #3, when combined with a positive ESP, makes us reasonably confident of a positive surprise this season.What's Driving the Better-than-Expected Earnings?During the first-quarter 2017 earnings release, AvalonBay announced its FFO per share guidance for second-quarter 2017. AvalonBay estimated FFO per share in the range of $2.18–$2.24 and core FFO per share in the band of $2.07–$2.13. Later, the company noted that it anticipates total rental revenue of established communities for second-quarter 2017 to grow 2.5–2.6% over the prior-year period.Notably, AvalonBay is well poised to grow on the back of a rising demand from household formation and favorable demographics. Moreover, increasing consumer confidence, on the back of job growth, rising wages, and a healthier balance sheet, promise strong prospects for the company.Additionally, defying concerns about supply in the market, the residential real estate market is back with a bang, driven by robust demand levels. Per a study by the real estate technology and analytics firm, RealPage, Inc. (RP), the second-quarter demand level of 175,645 apartments across the nation marked one-third increase from the level witnessed a year ago. This helped occupancy to remain high at 95.0% as of mid-year and led to stabilization in the annual pace of rent growth, which came in at 3.6%, close to 3.7% growth experienced in the first quarter. Notably, job formation and checked move-outs for buying homes acted as the catalyst.   Amid these, AvalonBay is likely to continue experiencing high occupancy. Although pace of rental growth has slowed down from the previous years, it is now likely to achieve stability.Also, over the past 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter FFO per share inched up 0.5% to 2.14, reflecting analysts’ optimism on the stock.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a few stocks in the REIT space that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to report a positive surprise this time around:CyrusOne Inc.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is currently pegged at $4.19.Furthermore, the company has increased total SSNOI guidance to 2.25–3% from the prior outlook of 2–3%, mainly due to better-than-expected seniors housing operating performance in the first half of 2017.Additionally, in sync with its strategic repositioning of its premier health care portfolio, the company continues to anticipate 2017 disposition proceeds to be around $2 billion.Our TakeWelltower’s diversified portfolio and strategic investments have the capability to serve as growth drivers in the long run. Also, a rise in senior citizen spending for healthcare reasons promises scope for growth. However, any rate hike remains a concern for the company due to its high exposure to long-term leased assets.

We believe the company’s adequate size and scale would help it capitalize on opportunities such as increasing healthcare spending and aging population. Furthermore, the sale of the SNF would lower the company’s exposure to this particular healthcare real estate category which is becoming more susceptible to top-line pressure due to the change in medical billing procedure.Also, university-based life science real estate is a new zone of investment which has grabbed attention and Ventas has already committed substantial amount to this segment. Such investments offer scope to capitalize on growing health-care-driven research and development, supported by top-tier research universities.

Lesser general and administrative costs, lower interest expense and other expenses also contributed to higher funds from operations. However, the positive was partially offset by the loss of income from apartment sales in 2016, reduced earnings from exiting the Asset Management business and lower tax benefits.Total revenue of $249.1 million outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $241.37 million. In addition, the reported figure came in higher than the prior-year quarter tally of $251.2 million.Apartment Investment and Management Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Apartment Investment and Management Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Apartment Investment and Management Company QuoteNote: The EPS numbers presented in the above chart represent funds from operations (FFO) per share.Quarter in DetailSame-store revenues increased 3.4% year over year to $145.9 million, while expenses edged down 0.3% year over year to $41.7 million. Consequently, same-store net operating income (NOI) climbed 4.9% to $104.2 million on a year-over-year basis.However, same-store average daily occupancy contracted 1 basis point year over year to 95.9%. Rental rates on renewals contracted 50 basis points (bps) from the expiring lease rates compared to the previous quarter. Rents on new lease improved to 1% from a 1% decline witnessed in the previous quarter.As of Jun 30, 2017, Aimco held cash and restricted cash on hand of $49.1 million. Moreover, the estimated fair market value of the company’s unencumbered apartment communities came in at $1.8 billion.Further, at the end of the quarter, Aimco’s outstanding borrowings on its revolving credit facility were $246 million and available capacity was $343 million, after considering $11 million of letters of credit backed by the facility.Portfolio ActivityDuring the quarter, Aimco invested $47 million in redevelopment and development. The company increased its revenue per apartment home by 7% to $2,038. Additionally, it enhanced the quality and expected growth rate of its portfolio. Specifically, the percentage of A, B and C+ home came in at 53%, 33% and 14% in second-quarter 2017 compared with 50%, 37% and 13% , recorded respectively in the year-ago quarter.     GuidanceFor third-quarter 2017, Aimco provided pro forma FFO per share guidance in the band of 60–64. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is 61 cents.DividendOn Jul 26, Aimco announced a quarterly cash dividend of 36 cents per share of Class A Common Stock for second-quarter 2017. This marks a 9% year-over-year increase. The dividend will be paid on Aug 31 to stockholders of record as of Aug 18, 2017.Bottom LineAimco has a solid portfolio, diversified in terms of geography and price point. Furthermore, the company has been revamping its portfolio through property sales and reinvesting the proceeds in select apartment homes with higher rents, superior margins and greater-than-expected growth.  Its efforts to reduce costs resulted in significant growth in Same Store NOI.Other than improvement in Same Store NOI, Aimco’s new construction and redevelopment activities also contributed to its bottom line.However, of late, Aimco has been witnessing sluggish rent growth in certain locations due to competition from new supply. The company’s elaborate construction project plans, along with planned capital replacement spending, remain key concerns. Moreover, even if the divestitures and its exit from the Asset Management business pay off in the long run, the company’s near-term adverse effects on earnings cannot be bypassed.Aimco currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Same-property NOI is now guided in the band of 3.3–4.6% from the previous range of 2.8–4.6%, marking a 30 bps expansion to the mid-point.For third-quarter 2017, the company projects core FFO per share in the $2.88–$2.98 range. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is currently pegged at $2.97.ConclusionWe are encouraged with the better-than-expected performance of Essex Property in the reported quarter. With a strong property base and solid balance sheet, it is likely to leverage on favorable demographic trends in its markets. The company’s substantial exposure to the West Coast market, which is home to several innovation and technology companies, offers ample scope to boost its top line over the long term.However, elevated apartment deliveries remain a concern. This results in aggressive rental concessions and moderate pricing power of landlords. In fact, such situations are expected to periodically disrupt the company’s earnings.Essex Property currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

(HST  -  Free Report) reported second-quarter 2017 adjusted funds from operations (""FFO"") of 49 cents per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 46 cents. Adjusted FFO per share also matched the year-ago tally.Results reflect growth in comparable hotel revenue per available room (RevPAR) and improvement in margin. The company also raised its full-year 2017 outlook.The company posted total revenue of nearly $1.44 billion, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.43 billion. However, the figure was down 1.2% from the prior-year number, as a result of revenue loss from sale of 12 hotels in 2016 and 2017.Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc. QuoteNote: The EPS numbers presented in the above chart represent funds from operations (“FFO”) per share.Quarter in DetailsDuring the reported quarter, comparable hotel revenues remained nearly flat year over year at $1.3 billion. Although, the company witnessed improvements in RevPAR, it was marred by a decline in food and beverage revenues.Comparable RevPAR (on a constant dollar basis) was up 1.7% year over year, driven by a 0.8% increase in average room rate and 70 basis points (bps) expansion in occupancy to 83.2%. At its domestic properties, comparable hotel RevPAR inched up 1.8%. However, the same at its comparable international properties was down 3.1% on a constant-dollar basis.Nevertheless, improvements in RevPAR aided GAAP operating profit margin growth of 50 bps for the quarter.During the quarter under review, the company invested around $16 million for redevelopment, and return on investment (ROI) capital expenditures. It also deployed approximately $47 million on renewal and replacement capital expenditures.In the second quarter, the company accomplished the sale of the Sheraton Memphis Downtown for $67 million, recording a gain of around $28 million.Finally, the company exited second-quarter 2017 with around $644 million of unrestricted cash and $775 million of available capacity remaining under the revolver part of its credit facility. Moreover, as of Jun 30, 2017, total debt was $4.0 billion, having an average maturity of 5.5 years and an average interest rate of 3.9%. Notably, the company did not buy back any shares in 2017. It has $500 million of capacity available under its current repurchase program.OutlookHost Hotels raised its outlook for full-year 2017. The company now expects adjusted FFO per share in the range of $1.64–$1.68 compared to the prior guidance of $1.60–$1.68. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is currently pegged at $1.66.This is backed by comparable hotel RevPAR (constant U.S. dollar basis) growth expectations of 1.00–1.75%, against the prior outlook of 0.0–2.0%.In ConclusionWe are encouraged with the better-than-expected performance of Host Hotels in the second quarter. The company’s solid portfolio of upscale hotels across lucrative markets, strategic capital-recycling program and a healthy balance sheet bode well for long-term growth. However, supply growth, specifically in the company’s key markets, remains a concern. In addition, dilutive impact of asset sales cannot be bypassed.

46,AVB,"Public Storage’s (PSA  -  Free Report) second-quarter 2017 funds from operations (“FFO”) per share of $2.31 missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.56. The figure was also down 1.3% from the year-ago tally of $2.34.Quarterly revenues of $664.3 million also fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $674.2 million. Nevertheless, revenues managed to grow 4.8% from the year-ago period.Results reflect a fall in weighted-average square foot occupancy in the same-store portfolio for the reported quarter. However, higher realized annual rent per occupied square foot supported its results. Also, the company benefited from its expansion efforts.Public Storage Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Public Storage Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Public Storage QuoteNote: The EPS numbers presented in the above chart represent funds from operations (“FFO”) per share.Behind the HeadlinesSame-store revenues advanced 3.3% year over year to $550.0 million during the second quarter, while net operating income (“NOI”) climbed 2.6% to $402.7 million. The increase in same-store revenues was primarily driven by a 4.4% rise in realized annual rental income per occupied square feet to $16.97. However, the weighted-average square foot occupancy of 94.5% contracted 90 basis points year over year.In addition, the company’s NOI from non-same store facilities enhanced on the back of 292 self-storage facilities acquired, developed or expanded since Jan 2015.Portfolio ActivityIn the reported quarter, Public Storage bought three self-storage facilities, comprising 0.2 million net rentable square feet, for $11.6 million. Following the quarter end, the company acquired or was under contract to acquire seven self-storage facilities, spanning 0.4 million net rentable square feet, for $47.1 million.Finally, as of Jun 30, 2017, the company had several facilities in development (3.9 million net rentable square feet), with an estimated cost of $468 million, as well as expansion projects (1.7 million net rentable square feet) worth roughly $191 million. Public Storage projects to incur the remaining $376 million of development costs related to these projects mainly over the next 18 months.LiquidityPublic Storage exited second-quarter 2017 with around $358.3 million of cash and cash equivalents, up from $183.7 million at the end of the prior year.DividendOn Jul 26, Public Storage’s Board of Trustees declared a quarterly dividend of $2.00 per share. The amount will be paid on Sep 28 to shareholders of record as of Sep 13, 2017.In ConclusionWe are discouraged with the lower-than-expected performance of Public Storage in the second quarter. However, higher realized annual rent per occupied square foot is a positive. Notably, the company is a recognized and established name in the self-storage industry in the U.S., and its acquisition and expansion efforts look encouraging. However, rising supply in a number of its markets is a headwind. Rate hike also remains a concern for the company.Public Storage currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Results indicated an improvement in same-store net operating income (NOI).The company has a decent surprise history.

The company offers a wide array of well-located storage units to its customers, including boat storage, recreational vehicle storage and business storage. In addition, the self-storage industry is anticipated to experience solid demand, backed by favorable demographic changes and events like marriages, shifting, death and even divorce. As such, in the to-be-reported quarter, the company is anticipated to benefit from steady demand in the self-storage industry, and witness growth in same-store revenues and NOI.However, there is an increasing supply of storage units in certain MSAs, which can adversely affect its pricing power. In fact, Extra Space Storage operates in a highly fragmented market in the U.S., with intense competition from numerous private, regional and local operators. Amid this, occupancy levels are also likely to remain nearly flat in the quarter under review.Amid these, prior to the second-quarter earnings release, there is lack of any solid catalyst. As such, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of FFO per share for the to-be-reported quarter remained unchanged at $1.05 over the past seven days.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Extra Space Storage will likely beat estimates this quarter.

The company re-launched its brand and marketing programs. In addition, with the omni-channel strategy gaining popularity among retailers, the company is initiating programs and events, as well as entering into several partnerships for upgrading services and amenities provided to its customers. In fact, over the last five years, the retail REIT invested over $5 billion in development projects and intends to spend around $1 billion each in 2017 and 2018.However, rising consumer purchases through the internet emerged as a pressing concern for retail REITs. The declining mall traffic and store closures amid aggressive growth in online sales kept retail REITs on tenterhooks.While the company is striving to counter such pressure through various moves, the implementation of such measures requires a decent upfront cost. Consequently, this would limit any robust growth in its profit margins in the to-be-reported quarter.Amid these, prior to the second-quarter earnings release, there is lack of any solid catalyst. As such, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of FFO per share for the to-be-reported quarter remained unchanged at $2.44 over the past seven days.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Simon Property will likely beat estimates this quarter.

The company is likely to benefit in the to-be-reported quarter from rising healthcare spending and a growing aging population. Further, strategic investments, tie-ups and acquisitions are anticipated to drive decent cash flows. Also, the sale of 64 Brookdale Communities to affiliates of Blackstone Real Estate Partners VIII L.P in the first half of 2017 helped it reduce the Brookdale concentration and the company remains on track with its deleveraging plan.However, growth might be hindered by cut-throat competition in the company’s markets. In addition, there is increased supply in senior housing category that is expected to lead to softness in this market fundamental. In addition, it cannot bypass the dilutive impact on earnings in the near term from huge asset dispositions.Overall, HCP’s performance during the quarter was inadequate to win analysts’ confidence.

50,AVB,"Boston Properties, Inc.

The company experienced a fall in rental revenues in the quarter.Nevertheless, Boston Properties has a mixed surprise history. In fact, the company exceeded estimates in two occasions for as many misses, over the trailing four quarters, resulting in an average positive surprise of 0.70%. This is depicted in the graph below:Boston Properties, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Boston Properties, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Boston Properties, Inc. QuoteBoston Properties lost 5.2% of its value, year to date, versus 3.4% growth of its industry.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Boston Properties is likely to beat estimates because it has the right combination of two key ingredients. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) to beat estimates, and Public Storage has the right mix.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP, which represents the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate of $1.63 and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.62, is +0.62%. This is a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive surprise.Zacks Rank: Boston Properties’ Zacks Rank #3, when combined with a positive ESP, makes us reasonably confident of a positive surprise this season.What's Driving the Better-than-Expected Earnings?Boston Properties’ assets are primarily concentrated in select high-rent, high barrier-to-entry geographic markets. The company’s solid tenant and industry base, including several bellwethers, ensure steady rental revenue growth. Over the past five years, it recorded annual revenue growth rate of 8.17%. This trend is likely to have continued in the second quarter as well.Notably, the U.S. office vacancy rate remained steady at 13% in the second quarter amid a balanced demand-supply environment, per a study by the commercial real estate services’ firm – CBRE Group Inc. (CBG). In around half of the U.S. office markets, vacancy recorded a decline and the national office vacancy rate is hovering close to its post-recession low.In fact, with economic improvement and recovery in the job market, healthy growth in demand for office spaces is likely to have continued in the company’s markets in the quarter under review. Particularly, growth in demand for office space is anticipated to have been fueled by technology and life sciences businesses in the to-be-reported quarter.The company projects second-quarter FFO per share in the range of $1.61–$1.63.Amid these, reflecting analysts’ bullishness on the stock, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter FFO per share inched up 0.6% to $1.62 over the last 30 days.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a few stocks in the REIT space that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to report a positive surprise this time around:CyrusOne Inc.

51,AVB,"Equity Residential (EQR  -  Free Report) reported second-quarter 2017 normalized funds from operations (“FFO”) per share of 77 cents, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The figure was higher than 76 cents reported in the year-ago quarter.Results reflected enhanced same-store net operating income (NOI) and lease-up NOI. In addition, the company experienced lower corporate overhead. However, the company experienced adverse impact on NOI, primarily stemming from its 2016 huge disposition activity. Also, the company incurred higher interest expense in the quarter.Per management, there is a solid and steady rental demand in the company’s coastal, gateway markets, helping occupancy, retention and renewal pricing even amid high apartment supply. As such, the company has increased its full year revenue guidance, driven by Seattle, San Francisco and New York City, which are likely to meet the “most optimistic projections for the year”.Moreover, total revenue during the reported quarter came in at $612.5 million, indicating 2.9% growth from the prior-year period. In addition, the figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $608.4 million.Quarter in DetailSame-store revenues (includes 71,354 apartment units) increased 2.1% year over year to $571.4 million and expenses climbed 4.1% year over year to $167.0 million. As a result, same-store NOI advanced 1.3% year over year to $404.3 million.The company experienced 2.5% growth in average rental rates to $2,669, but occupancy fell 40 basis points from the year-ago quarter to 95.8% for same-store portfolio.The company exited second-quarter 2017 with cash and cash equivalents of $37.7 million, down from $42.1 million at the end of the prior quarter.Portfolio ActivityDuring the quarter, Equity Residential acquired one consolidated apartment property in Seattle (136 apartment units) for around $57.0 million. On the other hand, it sold two consolidated apartment properties (600 apartment units) for a total of approximately $219.1 million. Additionally, the company stabilized its 348-unit 340 Fremont development in San Francisco at a Development Yield of 4.7%.OutlookFor third-quarter 2017, Equity Residential projects normalized FFO per share in the range of 77–81 cents. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is currently pegged at 78 cents.The company revised its projections for full-year 2017 and revenue guidance upward. It now estimates normalized FFO per share in the $3.08–$3.14 range compared with the prior guidance of $3.05–$3.15. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.11 lies within this range.For same-store portfolio, the company revised full-year 2017 physical occupancy to 95.8% from 95.7% and revenue growth in the range of 1.75–2.25% compared with 1.0–2.25% guided previously. Furthermore, expense is projected to increase 3.25–4.0% against the prior range of 3.0–4.0%, while NOI is estimated to grow 0.75–1.75% compared with the previous range of 0.0–2.0%.  Our ViewpointEquity Residential is anticipated to benefit from its efforts to reposition its portfolio in high barrier-to-entry/core markets, favorable demographics, lifestyle transformation and creation of new households.

52,AVB,"Vornado Realty Trust (VNO  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 31, after the market closes.In the prior quarter, this NY-based real estate investment trust (“REIT”) generated a negative surprise of 13.6% in terms of funds from operations (“FFO”) per share. Results reflected a fall in occupancy in the Washington DC portfolio.Moreover, Vornado does not have an impressive surprise history. In fact, in each occasions, over the trailing four quarters, the company missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate with an average negative surprise of 8.4%. This is depicted in the graph below:Vornado Realty Trust Price and EPS Surprise  Vornado Realty Trust Price and EPS Surprise | Vornado Realty Trust QuoteLet’s see how things have shaped up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderVornado’s high quality office and retail properties are concentrated in New York City. Also, the company has premier assets in both Chicago and San Francisco. These are high-rent and high barrier-to-entry geographic markets. Additionally, the company has a diversified tenant base.However, as part of portfolio-repositioning efforts, Vornado has been aggressively disposing its assets. Though such efforts to streamline its business are commendable, the earnings dilutive effects of these moves cannot be bypassed.Also, the company faces intense competition from developers, owners and operators of office properties, and other commercial real estate in its markets. Amid this, Vornado’s pricing power and occupancy gains are likely to remain limited.In addition, over the past seven days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter 2017 FFO per share moved south nearly 1.6% to $1.26, reflecting analysts’ bearish sentiments on the stock.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Vornado will likely beat estimates this season. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. However, that is not the case here as you will see below.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP, which represents the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate of $1.27 and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.26, is 0.79%. This is a meaningful and leading indicator of a surprise in the quarter.Zacks Rank: Vornado currently has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), which actually reduces the predictive power of ESP.It should be noted that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions. Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a few stocks in the REIT space that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to report a positive surprise this time around:CyrusOne Inc.

53,AVB,"Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE  -  Free Report) is slated to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 31, after the market closes.In the prior quarter, this Pasadena, CA-based urban office real estate investment trust (“REIT”) with particular focus on collaborative life science and technology campuses, generated a positive surprise of 1.37% in terms of funds from operations (“FFO”) per share. Results were backed by solid growth in revenues.Over the trailing four quarters, the company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two occasions, with an average beat of 0.17%. This is depicted in the graph below:Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. QuoteLet’s see how things have shaped up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderAlexandria focuses on Class A properties concentrated in urban campuses, primarily for the life science and technology entities. These locations are characterized by high barriers to entry and exit, and a limited supply of available space. This highly dynamic setting adds to the productivity and efficiency of the tenants, which in turn, ensures steady rental revenues for the company.In the to-be-reported quarter too, the company is likely to enjoy high occupancy, driven by high demand for its properties in premium locations. In addition, it is likely to record healthy internal and external growth, solid cash flow and decent balance-sheet strength. However, a substantial development pipeline, currency fluctuations and stiff competition can adversely affect Alexandria’s bottom-line growth in the quarter under review.Also, over the past 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of FFO per share for the second quarter remained unchanged at $1.50, reflecting lack of any solid catalyst for being overtly positive on the stock.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Alexandria will likely beat estimates this season. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. However, that is not the case here as you will see below.(You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.)Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Alexandria is 0.00%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate of $1.50 matches the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Zacks Rank: Alexandria’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings beat.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a few stocks in the REIT space that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to report a positive surprise this time around:CyrusOne Inc. (CONE  -  Free Report), likely to release earnings on Aug 2, has an Earnings ESP of +2.70% and a Zacks Rank #2.Piedmont Office Realty Trust, Inc.

54,AVB,"Huge profits and earnings surprises can lure you this earnings season. But rather than accumulating stocks later, investing in those that are yet to release their numbers and poised to beat expectations can fetch you more gains. This is because an earnings beat essentially serves as a catalyst and raises investors’ confidence in a stock. This leads to rapid price appreciation, ensuring more gains from one’s investments.Furthermore, buying an undervalued earnings play should translate into great returns when the stock eventually trades at a higher price. This brings us to the REIT industry, which has gained just 2.2% year to date compared with the S&P 500’s return of 10%.Admittedly, rate hike and cautious approach of investors have deterred gains from this industry so far this year. However, rather than entirely focusing on the rate factor, investors need to keep in mind that the operating performance of this special hybrid asset is highly determined by the dynamics of the individual asset categories. And a number of asset categories displayed strength in second-quarter 2017, with the economy and the job market showing signs of recovery.Take for example the industrial and office asset categories which hogged the limelight for experiencing high demand. Going by numbers, per a study by the commercial real estate services’ firm – CBRE Group Inc. (CBG) – the overall U.S. industrial real estate market remained upbeat in the second quarter, with the industrial availability rate declining 10 basis points to 7.8%.This not only marked the market’s 27th decline in the past 28 quarters, but also the lowest level since first-quarter 2001. Obviously, recovering economy and job market gains aided this improvement, but specifically, e-commerce boom and a healthy manufacturing environment were the chief drivers. Also, lower-than-expected completions of construction kept a check on the supply numbers.In addition, the U.S. office vacancy rate remained steady at 13% in the second quarter amid a balanced demand-supply environment. In around half of the U.S. office markets, vacancy recorded a decline and the national office vacancy rate is hovering close to its post-recession low.Moreover, with growth in cloud computing, Internet of Things and big data, and an increasing number of companies opting for third-party IT infrastructure, data center REITs are experiencing a boom market. In fact, demand has been outpacing supply in top tier data center markets. Despite enjoying high occupancy, these markets are absorbing new construction at a faster pace.Additionally, defying concerns about supply in the market, the residential real estate market is back with a bang driven by robust demand levels. Per a study by the real estate technology and analytics firm, RealPage, Inc. (RP), the second-quarter demand level of 175,645 apartments across the nation marked one-third increase from the level witnessed a year ago. This helped occupancy to remain high at 95.0% as of mid-year and led to stabilization in the annual pace of rent growth, which came in at 3.6%, close to 3.7% growth experienced in the first quarter. Notably, job formation and checked move-outs for buying homes acted as the catalyst.   The Zacks MethodologyHowever, not all REITs are equally poised to excel. In fact, despite the drivers, choosing the right stock could be quite difficult unless one knows the proper method. To make the task simple, we rely on the Zacks methodology, which takes into account a favorable Zacks Rank – Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) – and a positive Earnings ESP.Our proprietary methodology, Earnings ESP, denotes the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Research shows that for stocks with this combination of rank and ESP, chances of a positive earnings surprise are as high as 70%.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Here are four REITs that have the right combination of elements to deliver an earnings beat when they release second-quarter results:Liberty Property Trust (LPT  -  Free Report) carries a Zacks Rank #2 and has an Earnings ESP of +1.61%.

55,AVB,"The U.S. Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) industry gained its momentum back in the fiscal 2010 third quarter, after lackluster results in the second quarter that was preceded by two strong back-to-back performances in first quarter 2010 and fourth quarter 2009.The FTSE NAREIT Equity REIT Index reported total returns of 10.9% in the third quarter (as of September 23, 2010), vs. returns of 9.6% and a 9.5% for the Dow Jones Industrials and the S&P 500, respectively. In the second quarter 2010, this Equity REIT Index had produced negative total returns of 3.1%, vs. losses of 12.5% and 10.6% for the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrials, respectively, owing to broader stock-market concerns fueled by the European debt crisis that prompted investors to cut back their holdings.The upsurge in third quarter results was primarily due to the stabilization of market fundamentals, as well as from low interest rates and government policies, including subsidized mortgage rates, tax credits, increased FHA (Federal Housing Administration) lending and a government-sponsored slow down in distressed liquidations. Investors looking for high dividend yields also favored the REIT sector. The current dividend yield for the FTSE NAREIT Equity REIT Index is 3.8% compared to 2.6% for the 10-year U.S. Treasury Note.Struggling financial institutions have further contributed to the strong performance of the REIT sector. REITs are comparatively better equipped to raise capital to pay off debt, making them an increasingly attractive investment proposition. In 2009, REITs and REOCs (Real Estate Operating Companies) raised nearly $38 billion in an industry-wide push to recapitalize balance sheets, and over 90 secondary equity offerings were issued in addition to 37 unsecured debt offerings. With gradual stability in the overall industry, sector dynamics and individual companies’ strategies are currently receiving greater attention to capitalize on the future growth potential.The standout performance in the REIT industry during the third quarter was that of the diversified REITs (a total return of 14.9% as measured by the FTSE NAREIT Equity REIT Index), followed by regional malls (14.4%), apartment REITs (12.8%), residential (12.8%), shopping-center REITs (12.6%), self-storage (12.2%), office (10.8%) and healthcare REITs (10.5%). The relatively underperforming sectors were lodging/resorts (3.6%), specialty (4.6%), and mixed-use REITs (6.0%).   OPPORTUNITIESMany REITs are still trading at discounts to NAVs (net asset values), traditionally a good ""buy"" signal. Over the past 7 or so years, REITs had traded near or in excess of NAV. Continued issues in the availability of credit is expected to have a positive effect on commercial real estate down the road, as new office, apartment and retail construction has slowed considerably, which will benefit owners in a couple of years. Many companies that we cover have stopped all-new construction.With plummeting home prices and reduced access to credit, apartment REITs continue to perform strongly. We expect this sector to remain comparatively stable in the coming quarters, as renting has emerged as the only viable option for customers who could not avail mortgage loans or are unwilling to buy a house at present.In this environment, we remain bullish on AvalonBay Communities, Inc. (AVB  -  Free Report), one of the best-positioned apartment REITs, primarily focusing on developing multi-family apartment communities for higher-income clients in high-barrier-to-entry regions of the U.S. AvalonBay has Class A assets located in premium markets, such as Washington DC, New York City, and San Francisco, where the spread between renting and owning is still high despite home price declines.In addition, AvalonBay has a reasonably strong balance sheet with moderate near-term debt maturities and adequate liquidity. Consequently, the company can capitalize on potential acquisition opportunities due to distressed selling from owners and developers who cannot refinance their properties, which augurs well for its top-line growth.We are also currently bullish on Simon Property Group Inc. (SPG  -  Free Report), the largest publicly traded retail real estate company in North America, with assets in almost all retail distribution channels. The geographic and product diversity of the company insulates it from market volatility to a great extent and provides a steady source of income. Furthermore, Simon Property’s international presence gives it a more sustainable long-term growth story than its domestically focused peers.Another stock worth mentioning is Public Storage (PSA  -  Free Report), the largest owner and operator of storage facilities in the U.S. Public Storage has significantly increased the scale and scope of its operations through the acquisition of Shurgard Storage Centers that had a considerable presence in the European markets. Although Public Storage currently owns a 49% stake in Shurgard, the size and scope of its operations have enabled it to achieve economies of scale, thereby generating high operating margins and managerial efficiencies.In addition, the ‘Public Storage’ brand is the most recognized and established name in the self-storage industry with a presence in all the major markets across 38 states in the U.S. The storage facilities of the company have high visibility and are usually located in heavily populated areas that improve the local awareness of the brand. This provides a significant upside potential for the company.WEAKNESSESREITs still depend on access to capital to fund growth, and with the credit markets still not fully back to normal, it is difficult to raise money for new developments/acquisitions. In this scenario, most REITs are raising capital through property level debt, dividend reductions and equity offerings.Although both debt and equity financings provide the much-needed cash infusion, they could potentially burden an already leveraged balance sheet and dilute earnings. Property level debt is also harder to obtain and more expensive as commercial real estate prices remain under pressure.Fundamentals are declining in many suburban office markets as corporate expansion continues to slow. More and more corporations are putting off leasing decisions until the economy recovers fully. Recent employment trends are also not encouraging as the U.S. economy continues to shed jobs.Given the market uncertainties, we are bearish on AMB Property Corp. (AMB), an industrial REIT that leases industrial facilities to manufacturers, retailers, transportation companies, third-party logistics providers and other enterprises with large-scale distribution needs. The continued troubles in the residential sector are weighing on commercial property operations.The credit crunch has also widened the bid-ask spread between buyers and sellers of commercial real estate, which has caused deal volumes to fall dramatically. In addition, market vacancy increases will mitigate AMB’s ability to push through rental rate increases. This has significantly affected the top-line growth of the company.We would also avoid Host Hotels & Resorts Inc. (HST  -  Free Report), the largest lodging real estate investment trust (REIT) in the U.S. The majority of Host Hotels’ properties are concentrated in the luxury and upper-upscale segments, which have been the weakest performing segments during the economic downturn. This has affected the bottom line of the company and has reduced operating margins. The hotel industry is also cyclical in nature, and is heavily dependent on the overall health of the U.S. economy, as well as room supply and demand.Unfavorable macroeconomic conditions has compelled customers to cut back on discretionary spending, and now prefer lower priced brands over premium ones. Consequently, demand for Host Hotels has reduced comparatively, and the company is under severe stress to maintain profitability. The continuous acquisition spree of Host Hotels also involves significant upfront operating expenses with limited near-term profitability. New hotels usually take time to generate revenues, and will continue to drag down margins until they get established.

56,AVB,"Equity REITs rebounded nicely in the 2nd quarter, when equity REITs posted total returns of 29% (total return FTSE NAREIT Index), vs. a 15% gain for the S&P and an 11% gain for the Dow. So far in July, REITs are down about 8%; the worst performing sectors in July have been Regional Malls (-10.9%), Industrial (-9.8%), office/industrial (-9.6%) and apartments (-9.7%). Overall, REITs are still down 19% YTD in 2009 and 43% over the past year.
"
57,AVB,"OPPORTUNITIES
"
58,AVB,"Many REITs are still trading at discounts to NAV (net asset value), a good buy signal. Historically, over the past seven or so years, REITs have traded near or in excess of NAV.
"
59,AVB,"Even with dividend cuts and share price gains, the average yield for equity REITs is still near 6%. Yields are well in excess (280 bps) of the 10-year Treasury, although the spread has narrowed considerably over the past quarter.
"
60,AVB,"Most companies have been shoring up balance sheets by raising cash through equity and asset sales, with the proceeds being used to pay down debt.
"
61,AVB," The credit freeze will have a positive effect on commercial real estate down the road; new office, apartment and retail construction has slowed considerably which will benefit owners in a couple of years. Many companies that we cover have ceased all new construction.
"
62,AVB,"In this environment, we like well-capitalized companies that have adequate liquidity to fund maturing debt at least through 2010. One name we still have a Buy on is Avalon Bay Communities, Inc. (AVB  -  Free Report), an apartment REIT with low debt and assets in infill markets where little new supply will be coming on board. Fannie Mae (FNM) and Freddie Mac (FRE) are still heavy lenders for apartments, which gives buyers and sellers access to capital; as such, transaction volumes in multifamily are not as depressed as other sectors.
"
63,AVB,"In addition, we like Vornado Realty Trust (VNO  -  Free Report), another company with low comparative debt, lots of cash and class-A office assets in some good long-term, heavily supply-constrained areas.
"
64,AVB,"WEAKNESSES
"
65,AVB,"REITs still depend on access to capital to fund growth, and with the credit markets still tight, it is difficult to raise money for new developments/acquisitions.
"
66,AVB," Going forward, many REITs will raise capital through property level debt, dividend reductions, and equity offerings. Property level debt is harder to obtain and more expensive as commercial real estate prices continue to plummet. Many companies are writing down the value of assets. Share offerings are generally dilutive at low prices, which will depress near-term earnings.
"
67,AVB," Dividend cuts make the sector less attractive to income-oriented investors. Many REITs cut their dividends in 2009, and the pain is not over. We expect more cuts as 2009 progresses.
"
68,AVB,"A few companies are now paying a large portion of their dividends in new shares, which we view as a negative. This could become more common over the next few quarters if fundamentals decline and bank lending does not increase. 
"
69,AVB,"REITs will be dependent on asset sales to raise cash. Overall commercial sales volumes have decreased dramatically this year. There is still a large bid-ask spread between sellers and buyers and sales will be low throughout 2009.
"
70,AVB,"Expect share prices to be volatile over the next two quarters. Job growth and consumer spending patterns have been dismal so far this year, and there is no evidence that either are improving. Declining fundamentals will continue to weigh on the sector. 
"
71,AVB,"Specifically, we are negative on suburban office and industrial going forward. Suburban office and industrial vacancies are ticking up at a rapid pace, and absent job growth, filling space will be difficult.
"
72,AVB,"We still have sell ratings on Liberty Properties Trust (LRY), a suburban office/industrial REIT and Post Properties (PPS), an apartment REIT. While both companies have addressed balance sheet concerns, operationally, we think they will lag peers throughout 2009.
