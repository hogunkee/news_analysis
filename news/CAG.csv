1,CAG,"No matter how you slice, mash or fry it, Lamb Weston Holdings (LW) has been on a tear since going public a year and a half ago.The Eagle, Idaho-based company has become a top supplier of frozen potato, sweet potato, appetizer and vegetable products to restaurants and retailers worldwide. By finding new ways to get spuds to the public in new forms, its stock keeps trending higher.Take last quarter, when the company got a sales boost via Taco Bell's Nacho Fries. Yum Brands (YUM), the fast-food chain's parent company, called the spicy potato fries the most popular debut in Taco Bell's history. Nacho Fries are supposed to be a limited time offer, but could become a permanent menu item, Stifel analyst Christopher Growe said in an April 5 report on Lamb Weston.""This item provided a volume and likely mix benefit, and we believe that the success of this introduction is likely to keep the item permanently on the Taco Bell menu, furthering the need for even more capacity in the future,"" Growe said.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseLamb Weston Chief Executive Tom Werner says the company has benefited from strong demand and new product innovation.""As our strong third quarter and year-to-date results show, our commercial and supply chain teams are executing well and the operating environment continues to be favorable,"" Werner said on a recent earnings call with analysts.Lamb Weston has been expanding its production capacity to handle growing demand for its products.It recently added a french fry line in Richland, Wash., with an annual capacity of 300 million pounds of potatoes. It has broken ground on another french fry line in Hermiston, Ore., with similar capacity, which it expects to be operational in its fiscal fourth quarter 2019.Plus, it opened a new facility with an annual capacity of 180 million pounds of potatoes in Russia. Lamb Weston sells products in more than 100 countries and has 24 manufacturing plants around the globe.The company is focusing on product innovation to drive sales growth. Its current lineup shows a huge assortment of different ways to prepare potatoes. In fries alone, it offers straight, crinkle, curly, waffle and wedge cuts in different sizes, textures and seasonings. There are also potato chips, hash browns, tater tots, cubes, pancakes and varieties of mash.Like the scene in ""Forrest Gump"" where a character lists all the ways you can prepare shrimp, the litany of potato products seems to never end.In April, Lamb Weston introduced a new product called the Seashore Puff. It's a potato puff seasoned throughout with sea salt, black pepper and garlic.Earlier this year, it also introduced a way for food delivery services to keep fries hot and crispy in transit. The Crispy on Delivery offering combines product and packaging innovations.""It's a comprehensive solution that enables fries to stay hot and crispy for the fast growing home delivery channel,"" CEO Werner said. ""It is a promising solution to help customers expand delivery of fries which are typically the highest margin food product on their menus while meeting a clear consumer opportunity.""Crispy on Delivery fries maintain heat and crispiness for 30 minutes, while traditional fries start to lose their appeal after only 5 minutes. The new fry is lightly battered to withstand the challenges of delivery without sacrificing taste, the company said.Lamb Weston spun off from Conagra (CAG) in November 2016 and ended its first day of trading at 31.84. Since then, it has formed five bases and broken out of each to run higher.The stock broke out of a six-week flat base at a buy point of 68.80 on June 26. It trended sideways for several days, but climbed back into the buy zone Thursday with a 2% gain. Lamb Weston shares were up just 0.4% Friday, but that was enough to reach an all-time closing high of 70.19 on the stock market today. Its intraday high was 70.50.The company trounced sales-and-earnings expectations for the quarter ended Feb. 25 and guided Wall Street higher for the May quarter.Lamb Weston earned 91 cents a share on sales of $863 million, while analysts expected 77 cents and $814 million. Earnings per share jumped 54% year over year, compared with declines in the previous four quarters. Sales rose 12%, accelerating from single-digit gains in the preceding five quarters.The company said it expects fiscal 2018 sales to grow at the upper end of the mid-single digit range. It also targeted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, of $805 million to $810 million. That compares with its prior outlook of $780 million to $790 million.Lamb Weston has not yet set a date for reporting fiscal fourth-quarter results, but that's expected to happen in late July.Analysts expect the company to earn 62 cents a share on sales of $890 million. That would translate to year-over-year growth of 22% in earnings per share and 7% in revenue.The company expects a fourth-quarter tail wind from its Grown in Idaho brand retail products. The items have gained distribution with several large new customers, Werner said.""Over the next few months we will step up marketing investments to support this growth and that of our other brands,"" Werner said on the recent earnings call, which took place April 5.Lamb Weston cautioned that it sees increases in agricultural production and transportation costs. That could provide a headwind to growth.""We continue to believe that we are well positioned to create shareholder value over the long-term by focusing on our strategic and operational objectives,"" Werner said.Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.RELATED:Chart Reading For Beginners: Discover The 3 Most Profitable Chart PatternsLooking For The Next Nvidia?

2,CAG,"Conagra Brands (CAG) agreed to buy Pinnacle Foods (PF) for about $8.1 billion in cash and stock, gaining freezer-aisle brands such as Birds Eye to capitalize on growing demand for frozen foods.XThe deal values Pinnacle at $68 a share, the companies said in a statement Wednesday. The price is 23% above Pinnacle's closing level on April 19, when an activist investor disclosed a stake in the Parsippany, New Jersey-based company and began pushing it to sell itself. Bloomberg News reported last week that Conagra had approached Pinnacle about a deal. Including assumed debt, the deal values Pinnacle at about $10.9 billion.The purchase will give Chicago-based Conagra more exposure to one of the few bright spots in the grocery store: Frozen food sales are growing after years of decline. Even millennials, known for their foodie tastes, are embracing frozen meals, which are convenient and less expensive than takeout. More than half of Pinnacle's revenue comes from frozen brands including Birds Eye, Van de Kamp's and the Gardein line of vegetarian products.The pressure on packaged-food makers to get bigger has intensified in the aftermath of Whole Foods Market's sale last year to Amazon (AMZN). Frozen food, however, is considered relatively resistant to Amazon's push to get shoppers to buy more groceries online because they're tricky to deliver.Conagra's quarterly results, also posted on Wednesday, showed why the company is doubling down on frozen food with the Pinnacle deal. Conagra's refrigerated and frozen segment, with brands like Banquet and Healthy Choice, was the fastest-growing.""The long-awaited deal finally comes together,"" Stifel analyst Christopher Growe, who advises buying Conagra's stock, wrote in a note. ""The nearly $11 billion acquisition creates a powerhouse in the frozen food aisle.""Growe added it was ""a bit surprising"" that the multiple for the deal was lower than recent acquisitions in the food industry and the $68-a-share price came below his expectation of $75.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseActivist fund Jana Partners urged Pinnacle to explore a sale after reporting a 9.5% ke in the packaged food maker in April. The New York-based hedge fund, run by Barry Rosenstein, said in a filing then that it thought the company was in a good position to consider consolidation given its strength in the frozen foods industry.Jana also has history with Conagra, which in 2015 agreed to add two directors to its board in a settlement with the fund. It currently owns a stake in Conagra of less than 1 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Conagra's brands also include Marie Callender's and P.F. Chang's Home Menu.Pinnacle holders will receive $43.11 in cash and 0.6494 of a Conagra share for each of their shares. The implied price of $68 is based on the average price for Conagra in the five days ended June 21.In Conagra's earnings for its fiscal fourth quarter ended May 27, net sales climbed 5.6% to $1.97 billion, compared with the average analyst estimate of $1.93 billion. Adjusted earnings from continuing operations totaled 50 cents, beating the average estimate of 44 cents.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:IBD Stock Of The DayBest Growth Stocks To Buy And Watch: See Updates To IBD Stock ListsStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

3,CAG,"Stocks staged a solid open Wednesday, as the Trump Administration eased some China-trade threats, and strong gains across Europe halted a sell-off begun earlier in China. The morning's backdrop showed China's bear market worsening, and oil prices rising as markets assessed whether U.S. sanctions threatened against buyers of Iranian oil had opened a new chapter in the global trade war.China trade-sensitive names Boeing (BA) and Caterpillar (CAT) vied with oil names Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) to lead the Dow. ""Smackdown"" owner World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) scored one of the market's strongest early wins. Conagra (CAG) fell hardest among S&P 500 stocks, after announcing its acquisition of Pinnacle Foods (PF).The Nasdaq Composite popped 0.4% at the start of trade. The Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 each gained 0.3%.Markets in the U.S. and Europe strengthened after the Trump Administration backed away from threats to use executive authority to impose sweeping restrictions on China-based companies investing in U.S. technologies and businesses. Instead, news reports quoted senior administration officials saying the administration would rely on Congress to update existing laws, rather than assessing arbitrary restrictions based on national security threats.The official said the White House would work with Congress to update the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. rules, in a way that ""maintains the open investment climate"" in the U.S. That was a sharp change in tone from Monday's announcement that the administration would seek to halt further technology exports to China and block targeted Chinese investments in U.S. technology firms.On the Dow, Caterpillar and Boeing rose in tandem, up 1.7% apiece.  Caterpillar has fallen in nine of the past 10 sessions, Boeing has dropped in eight of the past 11 days. Both stocks have broken below key levels of technical support, causing significant damage to their base-building efforts.Exxon and Chevron (CVX) were also among the Dow's early leaders, up 1.6% and 1.9%, respectively, as oil prices jumped to six-week highs. The U.S. State Department on Tuesday threatened sanctions against countries and companies who failed to end purchases of Iranian oil by November. Oil also was squeezed higher by industry data showing a 9.2 million barrel draw on inventories in the week ended June 22. Economists had projected a 2.6 million barrel decrease. Official weekly supply numbers are due out from the Energy Information Administration at 10:30 a.m. ET.U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude vaulted 1.5% higher, to near $72 a barrel, in early trade.Conagra opened 6.8% lower — and Pinnacle Foods fell 4.1% — after Conagra said it would acquire the Parsippany, N.J.-based competitor in a cash/stock deal valued at $10.9 billion. Conagra owns the Chef Boyardee, Marie Callendar's and Healthy Choice Brands. Pinnacle's brands include Bird's Eye, Duncan Hines and Mrs. Paul's.The loss sent Pinnacle back below a 66.76 buy point in a 12-month saucer base. Conagra's tumble sent shares below their 10- and 40-week moving averages, snuffing a long-term basing effort.Also in the packaged food space, General Mills (GIS) notched an early 0.7% advance. The Minneapolis-based owner of Cheerios, Wheaties and Betty Crocker reported better-than-expected fiscal fourth-quarter earnings. Revenue met analyst targets, and company management issued upside full-year earnings guidance.World Wrestling Entertainment jack-hammered an 6.7% gain in opening trade. The Stamford, Conn.-based company announced a five-year deal placing its ""Monday Night Raw"" program on Comcast's (CMCSA) USA channel, and its ""Smackdown"" series on Fox Networks on Friday nights. The company said the deal would more than triple the annual value of its U.S. distribution rights. WWE shares are up 132% since the start of the year,In other earnings news, AeroVironment shook of its premarket loss and traded with narrow gains. Fiscal fourth-quarter earnings, reported late Tuesday, declined much less than expected and a 1% revenue gain that eked past the consensus target. The maker of remote-controlled drones remained in a buy range, after breaking out on Tuesday past a 61.25 cup-with-handle buy point in heavy volume.Drive-in burger joint Sonic (SONC) tanked 9.6%. The Oklahoma City, Okla.-based chain reported, after Tuesday's close, fiscal third-quarter revenue and earnings narrowly above analyst consensus targets. Same-store-sales and drive-in margins declined, and management trimmed is full-year earnings guidance. The dive narrowed Sonic's gain from a June 7 breakout to 8%.China's markets rebooted Monday's sell-off as the yuan slid below the 6.6-per-dollar level, a key technical level. The Shanghai Composite dropped 1.1%, digging deeper into bear market territory. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index swooned 1.8%, putting it more than 15% below its February high.Japan managed to buffer the selling somewhat. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 held to a 0.3% decline, despite the yen's safe-haven advance vs. the dollar.Stocks in Europe shook off early losses and rallied in afternoon trade. London's FTSE 100 jumped 1.1%, Frankfurt's DAX leapt 1.3% and the CAC-40 in Paris surged 1.4% higher.Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.RELATED:Stocks Bounce Modestly But Hold At Key Levels; 3 Rules For A Weaker MarketStock Futures Fall; 4 Trade-War Resistant Watchlist StocksThis Dividend Stock And Gas Pipeline Play Faces Big Q2 ExpectationsIBD Stock Of The Day Forms New Base After 62% RunTime To Buy This China Growth Stock Again?

5,CAG,"The stock market held decent gains near midday Wednesday as fears of a trade war with China waned, at least for a day. Wall Street was comforted by news that President Trump's plan to crack down on Chinese investment in U.S. firms could be less harsh than initially thought.The Dow Jones industrial average led the way, rising 0.5%. Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) gained more than 1.5% as oil prices rose again.

6,CAG,"The candy and snack food industries are doing well right now, based on statistics released Tuesday at the Sweets and Snacks Expo. But you wouldn't know that from the share prices of publicly traded companies in the sector.""Consumer staples in general are extremely out of favor,"" Edward Jones analyst Brittany Weissman said. ""Consumer staples have significantly underperformed the broader market.""IBD's confectionery industry group ranks near the bottom of 197 industry groups. It includes just four stocks: Mondelez International (MDLZ), Hershey (HSY), Tootsie Roll Industries (TR) and Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory (RMCF).Many makers of sweets and snacks are in IBD's packaged-food industry group, which ranks No. 161. It includes 29 stocks, among them Nestle (NSRGY), PepsiCo (PEP), General Mills (GIS), Kellogg (K), ConAgra Brands (CAG) and Hostess Brands (TWNK).Investors started rotating out of food stocks in mid-2016 in anticipation of rising interest rates, Weissman said.Amazon's (AMZN) acquisition of Whole Foods Market, announced in June 2017, added to the worries, she said.The Amazon-Whole Foods merger, completed in August 2017, led to large grocery sellers like Walmart (WMT) and Kroger (KR) gaining more negotiating power with manufacturers, she said. That's made it harder for food makers to pass on cost increases, such as rising grain and cocoa prices.Another factor hitting major candy and snack makers has been the rise of store brands. They include Kirkland Signature at Costco Wholesale (COST), Member's Mark at Walmart-owned Sam's Club and Wickedly Prime at Amazon.To combat these private-label products, the major candy and snack companies are focusing on product innovation to attract consumers. They're using new ingredients, different combinations, bold flavors and novel textures to entice customers.Many of these new products were on display at the annual Sweets and Snacks Expo, which ran Tuesday through Thursday in Chicago. The show had about 900 exhibiting companies and was expected to attract about 18,000 attendees.This year's Sweets and Snacks Expo is the biggest yet in terms of number of exhibitors and attendees, said Christopher Gindlesperger, vice president of public affairs and communications for the National Confectioners Association, which sponsors the show.Product trends among candy makers at this year's show include greater use of coconut and caramel in products, Gindlesperger said.Cocoa and chocolate producer Barry Callebaut is promoting its new ruby chocolate at the trade show. Introduced last September, it is the fourth type of chocolate after milk, dark and white. Made from the ruby cocoa bean, the pink chocolate has a ""berry-fruitness and luscious smoothness,"" the Swiss firm said in a press release.Candy sales in the U.S. are expected to reach $25.3 billion in 2018, up from $24.9 billion in 2017, marketing and consulting firm IRI said at the show.Snack sales are seen hitting $42.5 billion in 2018, up from $41.1 billion in 2017.""Consumers are still snacking,"" said Sally Lyons-Wyatt, executive vice president at IRI. ""On average consumers are snacking over 2.5 times a day. Younger consumers actually snack more than that.""Top growing categories in snacks include protein, fiber and energy snacks, she said. Consumers are also shifting more to crisps not made from potato or corn, she said. Consumers enjoy variety and are trying chips made from chickpeas, lentils, quinoa and other ingredients.Food companies are targeting millennials by offering products in smaller portion sizes suitable for snacking.""It seems like almost anything can be a snack right now,"" Edward Jones' Weissman said. ""You change the portion size and suddenly it's a snack. Everybody is focused on snacks. Yogurt went from breakfast to a snack. It's a much more crowded marketplace.""RELATED:Amazon Widens Its Influence Even More And Takes A Bite Out Of SnacksCampbell, Hershey, Humana Lead Frenzy Of Year-End M&A Activity

7,CAG,"Deere & Co. (DE) could be among the big losers in a China trade war as Beijing targets U.S. agricultural commodities, but the prospect of lower prices also boosted Hormel (HRL) and other food companies that could see lower costs.XChina said on Wednesday that it would slap tariffs on $50 billion worth of American imports, including soybeans, wheat, corn, cotton and other agricultural commodities. China imported $14 billion worth of soybeans from the U.S. last year.A range of agricultural commodity prices, including soybeans and corn, fell on fear that lower sales to China would create slack.If the American farmers who buy Deere equipment are hurt by China tariffs, they'll be slower to replace or upgrade old Deere equipment.On the flip side, weaker demand from China would hold crop prices lower. Hopes for cheaper corn, wheat and other commodity prices lifted packaged food companies, while the prospect of cheaper soybeans, which are mostly used for animal feed, not human consumption, gave IBD's Food-Meat Products industry group a big boost.Hormel stock finished 4.8% higher on the stock market today, Kellogg (K) rose 2.5%, General Mills (GIS) 2.4%, Conagra Brands (CAG) 2.3% and Flowers Foods (FLO) 1.7%. The packaged food sector got slammed two weeks ago when General Mills cut its earnings outlook, citing higher input prices.Meanwhile, shares of Deere, which makes tractors, combines, harvesters and other agricultural equipment, closed down 3%.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

Smucker Co. (SJM), ConAgra (CAG) and Mondelez (MDLZ). Kraft Heinz and Campbell Soup hit the sector last month on their weak quarterly reports.Shares of General Mills plunged 8.85% to 45.51 on the stock market today, hitting their lowest level in nearly five years.

Natural, wholesome and premium fare is in demand in pet food, as in human food, according to General Mills.Packaged food is under strain as private-label house brands as well as organic and natural offerings displace mainstream products on grocery shelves at the likes of Walmart (WMT) and Kroger (KR) and Amazon (AMZN)-owned Whole Foods.Walmart is General Mills' biggest customer, accounting for some 20% of sales.Packaged food companies have responded with cost cuts, including on marketing, to preserve profit margins, but that strategy is running out of steam.

11,CAG,"McCormick (MKC) agreed to acquire Reckitt Benckiser Group's food business for $4.2 billion, adding French's mustard and Frank's RedHot sauce to its lineup of spices and seasonings.XThe deal brings a stable of well-known condiments to Sparks, Maryland-based McCormick. For Reckitt Benckiser, unloading the products continues an overhaul that began with an expansion into baby formula through the British company's acquisition of Mead Johnson Nutrition Co. for $16.6 billion.The transaction price equates to 20 times the division's earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, ""which feels to us like a very high price for a U.S.-oriented ambient food business,"" James Edwardes Jones, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, wrote in a note. He expects the transaction to dilute RB's earnings per share by about 1%.The deal comes as speculation swirls about the next round of consolidation in the packaged-food business. In February, Kraft Heinz (KHC) was spurned in a blockbuster bid to take over Unilever (UL), the British-Dutch maker of Hellmann's mayonnaise and Knorr soup. In the aftermath, Unilever was cited by analysts as a possible bidder for the Reckitt business.Nestle SA, the world's largest food company, is also shaking up its portfolio. Under activist pressure to improve results, it's considering selling its U.S. candy operations. Investor Nelson Peltz's Trian Fund Management this week set its sights on Procter & Gamble (PG), the U.S. giant that competes with Unilever in personal care.Led by Chief Executive Officer Rakesh Kapoor, Reckitt said it was looking to unload its food business in April, when the Slough, England-based company described the division as ""non-core."" With 411 million pounds ($536 million) in sales last year, French's Foods accounted for 4% of Reckitt's total revenue.French's and Frank's RedHot will become McCormick's second- and third-largest brands, respectively, CEO Lawrence E. Kurzius said in a statement late Tuesday. McCormick's pro forma 2017 annual net sales are expected to be approximately $5 billion, with significant margin growth, according to the statement.In acquiring Reckitt's food business, McCormick faced a large group of potential rivals. Bloomberg reported in May that the sale was expected to draw interest from Post Holdings (POST) and Conagra Brands (CAG). Other possible bidders included JM Smucker (SJM), Campbell Soup (CPB), Pinnacle Foods (PF) and Ajinomoto, people familiar with the situation said at the time.In addition to selling yellow mustard and hot sauce, the division makes ketchup, onion flavorings and other products. Hot sauce will continue to see robust growth, with opportunities for expansion, McCormick said. The company said it plans to expand the global presence of Frank's RedHot and French's products, whose sales are now concentrated in the U.S.McCormick dates to 1889, when founder Willoughby McCormick began selling flavors and extracts door to door. The company went after another U.K. business in 2016, when it considered buying Premier Foods. But the suitor walked away from takeover talks in April of that year, saying that Premier was demanding too high a price. McCormick's Kurzius said at the time that Premier was just one of the company's M&A ideas.Credit Suisse Group AG is serving as the financial adviser to McCormick on the RB Foods transaction, and Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP is legal counsel. Morgan Stanley acted as lead financial adviser to Reckitt and the company also received advice from Robey Warshaw.The deal is expected to be completed in the third or fourth quarter of McCormick's fiscal 2017, pending regulatory approvals. McCormick plans to fund the deal with a combination of equity and debt, and said it has obtained committed bridge financing.

Campbell, like other food giants, continued cost-cutting efforts and curbed promotions. Gross margin rose to 35.9% from 34.3% a year earlier.Revenue fell 3.6% to $1.9 billion, just below expectations for $1.93 billion, due to currency fluctuations and the impact of retailer inventory movements on its U.S. soup business, the company said. It was the second straight year-over-year sales decline and the worst drop in nearly three years.For the full year, Campbell expects revenue to fall closer to the lower end of its prior guidance for -1% to 1%.

49,CAG,"If you like ""The Odd Couple,"" May was your kind of market. A mix of technology stocks and defensive sectors outperformed. The tech stocks were driven by secular themes that seem able to keep growing even if the overall economy's growth is tepid.The S&P 500 gained 1.41% last month while U.S. diversified stock mutual funds inched ahead by a more modest 0.38%. Global science/technology funds and science-technology funds led sectors, advancing 5.88% on average and 4.69% respectively.Other leading sectors were more defensive. Utility funds gained 3.43% and international real estate funds tacked on 3.12%. Consumer goods funds also did well, growing 2.00%.""The technology sector did well because of across-the-board interest in cell phones, mobile devices and software,"" said Bernie Horn, a manager of $431.8 million Polaris Global Value Fund (PGVFX), an IBD Best Mutual Fund Awards winner, having outperformed the MSCI EAFE over the past one, three, five and 10 years that ended Dec. 31.Some cloud computing leaders also added to tech's showing. Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon.com (AMZN) posted gains. ""They are growing their cloud services dramatically,"" said David Chalupnik, head of equities for Nuveen Asset Management.IBD'S TAKE: Amazon has a solid 97 Composite Rating. It posted a 32.1% earnings surprise last quarter. See how its additional easy-to-understand fundamental and technical data stack up against rivals' at IBD's Stock Checkup.Defensive sectors also did well as investors sought safety amid doubts about the strength of economic growth. ""The market was having a debate,"" Chalupnik said. ""Investors aren't sure which way the economy is headed. The economic numbers that (came out) in May were mixed. The employment number was OK, but retail sales were a little light. The CPI (inflation rate) number was low for the second month in a row."" That last item is a sign that the U.S. economy is not heating up very fast.Precious metals funds, a defensive group, inched up 0.34% due to investor jitters over Washington, D.C., Horn said. ""The weekly hysteria over Trump comments regarding Russia tends to make some people think that the Federal Reserve may not be able to increase rates as expected,"" he said. ""That puts monetary policy into flux, which usually drives money into precious metals.""Large-cap growth funds gained 2.87%, leading U.S. diversified stock mutual fund categories.World equity funds easily topped U.S. stock funds with a 2.92% gain.Taxable bond funds inched up 0.64% on average. Tax-exempt funds tacked on 1.20%.Going forward, Horn expects stock markets to benefit from improving economic growth and diminished political drama. ""Notwithstanding political volatility around the world, underlying economic growth is slowly increasing,"" Horn said. ""And there's less of the uncertainty that was holding back individual and corporate spending. The U.S. elections, Brexit (the initial decision), the French election — all are in the past. The U.S. market has seen valuations rise. But outside the U.S., there are lots of great values.""Magna International (MGA), a Canada-based maker of car and truck parts, is one such name he likes. ""In an environment where competition among parts suppliers has been reduced, surviving companies like this are well-positioned to provide components whether the world goes electric or not,"" he said.And he still sees U.S. stocks that he likes. ""Quest Diagnostic (DGX) is the largest provider of medical tests in the country,"" Horn said. ""They're doing a better job of creating efficiencies in their operations, keeping costs in line.""He also likes NextEra Energy (NEE). ""It's one of the best-run utilities in the country if not the world, with a strong presence in clean fuels like natural gas and wind and solar to a lesser extent. It's not the cheapest stock, but management makes continuous improvements in their cost structure.""Horn also expects health insurers and managed care providers Anthem (ANTM) and UnitedHealth Group (UNH) to benefit from the reduction of regulatory burdens of any arrangement that replaces or reforms ObamaCare.Chalupnik sees potential for better growth from key foreign markets than the U.S. Europe, China, Japan and emerging markets are growing at decent rates, he says. ""The whole global economy is growing together,"" he said. ""It's the first time since 2010 that you could say that.""His team has overweights in materials and industrials relative to the S&P 500, although it has trimmed its overweights. It has held its energy weighting steady.Detroit Edison (DTE) illustrates his appetite for energy. ""People and businesses still need electricity,"" he said. ""It is a very well run utility. It has good management, a good regulatory environment. It delivers quarter-in, quarter-out."" In addition, the stock has a 3% dividend yield.He also likes Wal-Mart Stores (WMT). ""It's a very stable company, probably the next big growth company out there. It's one of the few retailers that's growing same-store sales. And its e-commerce business is tremendous. And it's trading at an attractive multiple.""Share price is up 15% so far this year, including a 5% gain in May. But the stock has a weak 59 Composite Rating from IBD, on a scale from 1 to 99.Douglas Burtnick, a manager of $1.8 billion Aberdeen U.S. Small Cap Equity (GSXIX), an IBD Best Mutual Funds Award winner for topping the S&P 500 over one, three, five and 10 years, likes Ellie Mae (ELLI). ""They sell software and services to banks, which help them create more efficiency around the mortgage origination process,"" he said.Ellie Mae's systems are helping to transform what has been a paper-oriented industry into a digitally focused one. ""That makes the process faster and easier,"" Burtnick said. ""Banks are willing to pay for that efficiency.""And Chalupnick likes the outlook for Lamb Weston (LW), a producer and distributor of frozen foods that was spun out of ConAgra (CAG) late last year. ""It is a relatively new company, and it is under-followed,"" he said. ""They are one of the few packaged-goods food companies that is growing its unit volume. General Mills unit volume is down (in its North American retail segment).""RELATED:Mutual Fund Managers Look For Winners In Industrials, Materials, Tech, BanksThe Painless Way To Add $140,000 To Your Retirement Account

Smucker's sales disappointed Wall Street on weakness in pet food and coffee. The package food sector is consolidating, and shares of some companies have soared recently amid increased M&A activity.Smucker's coffee revenue of $513.3 million in Q1 was down from $565 million a year earlier, in part on weak Dunkin' (DNKN) K-Cup pods sales and lower net prices. Sales of Kibbles 'n Bits, Meow Mix and other pet food  products collectively fell 6% to $519.5 million, in part on difficult comps vs. strong sales of new brands a year before.However, the company expects to achieve $100 million of incremental synergies for the full fiscal year as it consolidates after divestments and recent acquisitions, such as Meow Mix maker Big Heart Pet Brands, which it acquired in March 2015.Smucker maintained it outlook for full-year adjusted EPS of $7.60 to $7.75, the midpoint of which is a little below analysts' consensus for $7.70.

Revenue grew 15% to $1.87 billion, helped acquisitions, topping views of $1.83 billion.Constellation Brands beer sales rose 19% in part on the launch of its ""120 Days of Summer"" advertising campaign, while wine and spirits sales increased 8%. The company sees full-year EPS of $5.98-$6.28, the midpoint below consensus for $6.27.Shares closed up 3.8% at 165.40 stock market today, nearing a 165.91 buy point.Shelf-stable and frozen foods maker ConAgra Foods' Q4 EPS minus items fell about 12% to 52 cents, matching estimates. Sales declined 31% to $2.83 billion, lighter than the expected $2.9 billion. The struggling food giant is in the midst of a major restructuring.The maker of Blue Bonnet margarine, Chef Boyaree ready-to-eat pasta meals and dozens of other brands earlier divested its Private Brands business. On Thursday, it affirmed earlier announced plans to spin off its Lamb Weston potato products business this fall, sell parts of its Commercial Foods segment and move its headquarters to Chicago ""as part of becoming more lean and agile,"" CEO Sean Connolly said in the earnings statement.Shares edged up 0.4% to 47.81.Payroll and human resources services provider Paychex reported a 9% hike in fourth quarter revenue to $753.9 million, beating estimates of $751.5 million. EPS minus one-time items rose 11% to 49 cents, matching estimates and reversing from a miss the prior quarter.Paychex projects that total service revenue will increase 7% to 8% for the current fiscal year, and that net income will increase about 8%. Both forecasts topped analyst consensus.Shares climbed 6% to 59.50, shooting beyond buy range. Earlier this month, the stock broke out of a base with a 54.88 buy point.The spice maker's second-quarter adjusted earnings were flat, year over year, at 75 cents a share, topping analyst estimates by a penny. Meanwhile revenue grew 4% to $1.06 billion, more or less in line with views.For the year, McCormick expects $3.68-$3.75 in adjusted per-share profit and sales growth of 1%-3%, or 4%-6% minus foreign exchange rates. Wall Street expects 2.5% sales growth and EPS of $3.74.Shares climbed 3.9%, also gapping above buy range.The Olive Garden parent reported per-share profit growth of 9% to $1.10 in Q4, beating views by 2 cents. But a 5% sales decline to $1.79 billion fell short of estimates for $1.81 billion in revenue.Same-restaurant sales rose 1.7% for the quarter.For fiscal 2017, Darden sees EPS of $3.80-$3.90, short of current views for $3.99, and same-restaurant sales growth of 1%-2%.Shares sank 4%, dropping into sell territory.
"
67,CAG,"Packaged-foods company ConAgra Foods (CAG) lowered its fourth-quarter earnings estimate due to weak appetites for private-label brands and a slide in its consumer-foods segment.Guidance is now set at 55 cents per share vs. its earlier view of ""slightly in excess"" of 60 cents a share. Analysts expect 62 cents.The Omaha-based company attributed the outlook cut to a 7% quarterly volume decline in the consumer-foods segment and weak profits in the private-label unit.But lowering guidance has become common practice for ConAgra, said Morningstar analyst Erin Lash in a research note. The company previously lowered its near-term earnings outlook back in February, again reflecting weaknesses in its consumer-foods and private-label segments.""I can't recall any other major packaged food firms repeatedly lowering guidance quarter-after-quarter of late,"" said Lash in an email to IBD.Shares of ConAgra sank 8% on the stock market today. Rivals Kraft (KRFT) and General Mills (GIS) both dipped 0.2%.ConAgra acquired Ralcorp Holdings at the end of 2012, making it the biggest private-brand packaged-food business in North America by sales. But it will take time to fully integrate the new takeover.Lash said she sees the Ralcorp acquisition favorably since it will strengthen ConAgra's relationship with retailers, ""but incremental product innovation and marketing support investments for its brands and private-label will be needed to put it on more stable ground.""ConAgra has a slew of household names in its pantry. Its consumer-foods segment includes brands such as Bertolli, Orville Redenbacher's, Hebrew National, Slim Jim and Hunt's. Chef Boyardee was singled out by the company as one of the retail brands that is primarily proving to have profit challenges.And Q4 operating profit for private-label brands is expected to decrease by about $60 million, said the company. The segment's issues were noted in March, when it blamed below-expected profitability on ""sales force and supply chain transition issues, as well as pricing actions implemented in response to competitive pressure.""The company will report Q4 earnings on June 26.""We've long held a more conservative stance on ConAgra's prospects, given it operates with a portfolio of second- and third-tier brands and its profitability pales in comparison to peers (10% versus high-teens operating margins),"" said Lash in the research note. ""However, this revision is even more dire than we expected, and we plan to lower our near-term profit outlook.""

70,CAG,"Politicians and policymakers continued to deal with the ramifications of the U.K.'s decision to vote to leave the European Union, but investors shrugged off ""Brexit"" with stocks enjoying solid gains. Big banks such as JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC) and Citigroup (C) hiked payouts after the Federal Reserve OK'd their capital plans in the second round of stress tests. Nike (NKE) ran ahead despite a sales stumble, the finance arm of General Electric (GE) is no longer ""too big too fail."" Tesla Motors (TSLA) faces a regulatory probe while Volkswagen (VLKAY) paid a hefty price to settle an investigation.Stocks started the week as they finished the prior week -- falling sharply in reaction to the Brexit vote. But financial markets roared back, with the S&P 500, Nasdaq and Dow industrials all up more than 3% for the week and above key support levels, helped by Bank of England signals Thursday that it would ease further this summer. Notable breakouts included NetEase (NTES) and Lockheed Martin (LMT).Thirty-one of the 33 biggest banks on Wednesday passed the second round of the Fed's annual stress tests, the industry's equivalent to final exams, clearing their plans to hike buybacks or dividends. The U.S. subsidiaries of Deutsche Bank (DB) and Banco Santander (SAN) were the only ones that failed the second half of the tests, which gauges whether banks' capital and shareholder-return plans would hold up in a downturn and evaluates banks' abilities to assess their own financial planning. The Fed passed Morgan Stanley (MS) on condition that it fix risk-management weaknesses and resubmit its capital plan – the financial forecast that banks submit to the Fed for the tests – by Dec. 29. But Morgan, along with Bank of America, JPMorgan and Citigroup, all announced bulked-up capital-return plans shortly after results were released.Wednesday's results follow the first round of the stress-test results during the prior week. All 33 banks passed that round.JPMorgan rose 2.8%, but failed to end the week above its 200-day line. Morgan Stanley climbed 5.7%. Deutsche Bank slid 5.5%, setting fresh record lows.The finance arm of General Electric is no longer deemed ""systemically important,"" according to the Financial Stability Oversight Council, ending the GE Capital ""too big to fail"" listing. With the ruling, GE will no longer have to follow minimum capital and liquidity requirements outlined in the Dodd-Frank Act. The nonbank Systemically Important Financial Institution (SIFI) label was put on GE Capital in 2013. But since then General Electric has slashed GE Capital assets as it refocuses on its industrial core.GE shares rose 5.6% to 31.49, near a 32.15 buy point.The ISM manufacturing index rose 1.9 points in June to 53.2, its best reading in 15 months. The new orders and production subindexes showed solid gains. The employment measure rose 1.2 points to 50.4, the first positive reading of 2016. The export orders gauge rose to its best level since late 2014. Separately, U.S. automakers reported strong U.S. sales, with most roughly in line with analyst expectations.The June employment report is due July 8, but with the Federal Reserve likely on hold for the foreseeable future, it may not have as great a market impact.The No. 1 sportswear brand topped analysts' profit views by a penny with flat year-over-year Q4 EPS of 49 cents. But sales slightly missed views with a 6% gain to $8.24 billion, the third straight quarter to miss revenue estimates. Currency-neutral global futures orders rose 11%, below estimates. Nike sees high-single-digit reported revenue growth in fiscal 2017. Q1 guidance disappointed. But analysts broadly remain bullish on Nike's long-term story, and management assured on the earnings call that inventory levels were ""clean"" and its basketball business was strong.Nike named Apple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook as its lead independent director late Thursday. Founder Phil Knight is stepping down as chairman.Nike shares rose 5.7% for the week.Volkswagen agreed to an estimated $14.7 billion in buybacks and fixes for diesel engine models sold in the U.S. after earlier admitting that it had altered software in them to cheat on emissions tests. But the problem is far from resolved. The world's largest automaker still faces multiple lawsuits. And after Volkswagen confirmed the U.S. settlement, Europe's Industry Commissioner Elzbieta Bienkowska called on Volkswagen to offer similar compensation to VW buyers in Europe, Reuters reported. Volkswagen fell 2.6% for the week.Tesla Motors confirmed late Thursday that regulators are probing a fatal crash of a Model S operating in self-driving mode. The news could have negative implications for autonomous driving broadly. But Tesla still rose 2% on Friday and 12.1% for the week, closing just below its 200-day and 50-day moving averages.Mobileye (MBLY), which makes driver-assistance camera systems for Tesla and many others, announced an alliance with BMW and Intel (INTC) on Friday to produce a fully autonomous vehicle by 2021. Mobileye soared 13%.""Hunger Games"" studio Lions Gate Entertainment (LGF) is acquiring premium cable network Starz (STRZA) in a cash-and-stock deal worth $32.73 a share, or $4.4 billion. Starz Series A stockholders will receive 18 in cash and 0.6784 of a share of Lions Gate nonvoting stock, while Starz Series B common stockholders will receive $7.26 in cash, 0.6321 of a share of Lions Gate voting stock and 0.6321 of a share of Lionsgate nonvoting stock, the companies said. Stifel called the move ""appropriately defensive,"" given the movie industry's volatility, among other factors. The deal brings Lions Gate a rival to Time Warner (TWX) premium channel HBO. Lions Gate fell 3.9% to 19.45, while Starz jumped 3.35% to 29.67.Hershey (HSY): The chocolate giant rejected an unsolicited $107-a-share bid from snacks giant Mondelez (MDLZ), saying it sees no basis for further talks. Hershey still closed up 14.3% to 111.95 on Thursday, suggesting that some investors see a sweeter offer working.Energy Transfer Equity (ETE): The pipeline company terminated its $33 billion merger deal with gas pipeline leader Williams Co. (WMB) after a court ruled, despite an appeal from Williams, that Energy Transfer was contractually entitled to end the agreement. Energy Transfer shares fell 0.2%. Williams, which is seeking monetary damages, fell 3.5%, largely on the surprise news that its chairman and five other board members resigned.In what some view as a defensive play against Wal-Mart (WMT), Amazon.com set July 12 for its second annual deal-loaded Prime Day -- expected to be its biggest shopping day of the year. Last year's Prime Day was the biggest single-day shopping sale in Amazon's history and helped drive Prime memberships, even though many shoppers and analysts said the actual deals weren't that great.Wal-Mart, apparently in a pre-emptive strike against Amazon, announced it was offering a 30-day trial membership of its Prime-comparable ShippingPass, which also offers free two-day shipping. The membership fees are half that of Prime membership.Amazon shares rose 3.8%, Wal-Mart 1.2%.Alcoholic beverage maker Constellation Brands (STZ) reported a 50% per-share earnings bump to $1.55, while revenue rose 15% to $1.87 billion, topping Street views on both the top and bottom lines.

Shares rose 7.3% for the week, hitting a record high.Late Thursday, Micron Technology (MU) reported $2.89 billion in sales minus items, down 25% year over year, and an 8-cent per-share loss ex items, swinging from a 54-cent gain in the year-earlier quarter. Fiscal Q3 sales missed analysts' forecast for $2.96 billion, but losses topped views for a 9-cent loss.  Micron announced a $300 million cost-cutting plan that includes job cuts.Micron shares tumbled 9.2% on Friday, 5.4% for the week.General Mills' (GIS) fiscal Q4 earnings per share and revenue both beat estimates, and it raised its cost savings estimate to $600 million by 2018, up from $500 million earlier. The maker of Cheerios and Wheaties cereals and other shelf-stable brands has topped earnings estimates in four of the last five quarters. Shares leapt 8.8% for the week to a record high.In contrast, shelf-stable and frozen foods maker ConAgra Foods (CAG) reported lower Q4 EPS that just met views and a worse-than-expected revenue decline. ConAgra affirmed plans to split off its Lamb Weston potato products business this fall, sell parts of its commercial foods business and move its headquarters to Chicago. ConAgra climbed 3.1% for the week, hitting a record high.Acuity Brands (AYI), a highly-rated company that makes smart, connected lighting systems, reported third-quarter results that topped expectations. Acquisitions helped sales, and the company remained optimistic despite any potential impact from the U.K.'s vote to leave the EU. The company has a 97 Composite Rating out of a best-possible 99. Acuity Brands stock rose 1.45% for the week.Paychex: Outsourcing services firm Paychex (PAYX) said Q4 EPS climbed 11% to 49 cents, in line with views. Revenue increased 9% to $753.9 million, beating estimates. The stock popped on the report, trading up 8.8% for the week to 59.44, the best since late 2000. That's also more than 8% past a consolidation buy point at 54.88.

137,CAG,"Tuesday's column discussed the value of weekly charts in analyzing the long-term health of a dividend play. Is the stock finding buyers at a prior level of upside resistance? How has the stock fared on a weekly closing basis? And do you see a potential new base forming?You want more tools. These can help. Check the RS Rating. This tool should apply to an income stock just as it does a high-adrenaline growth play.If your dividend stock has a Relative Price Strength Rating of 80 or higher, it means your stock is in the top fifth of the U.S. market in terms of 12-month relative performance. Knowing that may help you keep the conviction necessary to hold on.In IBD's Dividend Leaders screen, a quarter of the 59 names show an RS Rating of 80 or higher. They include Hasbro (HAS) (93 RS), ConAgra Foods (CAG) (91 RS), Coca-Cola Enterprises (CCE) (90), Home Depot (HD) (87), Altria (MO) (84) and CME (CME) (80).It's also worthwhile comparing a stock's RS Rating with those of its industry peers. IBD Stock Checkup does that instantly for you. Home Depot ranks fourth among 18 stocks in the Retail/Wholesale-Building Products industry group. That's a strong showing. Analyze the moving averages. If your stock's 10-week and 40-week moving averages are rising, that's positive. It means the mid- and long-term price trends are up.Last week, many stocks punctured one or both support lines. Hasbro fell below the 40-week line briefly. But Coca-Cola Enterprises bounced off its 10-week average, revealing exceptional strength. As weeks pass, see if Hasbro can reclaim its 10-week line. A prolonged stay below this line signals weakness. Uptrend or downtrend? This is best checked on a weekly chart. Do you see a pattern of higher highs and higher lows over at least several months? CME has done so since April 2014 despite last week's brief plunge.

186,CAG,"Moving ahead with its efforts to reshape its portfolio, Conagra Brands, Inc. (CAG  -  Free Report) closed the previously announced sale of its Canadian Del Monte processed fruit and vegetable business to Bonduelle Group. The sale was valued at nearly $32 million, or C$43 million.Conagra Brands announced its plan to sell the aforementioned business this February, as it remains focused on allocating resources to best strategic areas, which is likely to boost shareholders’ value. In this regard, the company has undertaken many strides in the past. We believe that such efforts will help the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company revive investors’ confidence in the stock that has been bearing the brunt of input cost inflation. In fact, Conagra has lost 5.1% in the past three months, against the industry’s 3.7% growth.Let’s see if the company’s portfolio revamping efforts can provide respite.Conagra On Track to Revamp PortfolioTo this end, Conagra Brands exited its struggling private label brands in 2015, as this business was bearing the brunt of soft volumes and flaring commodity costs. Thereafter, the company divested non-key businesses, including Spicetec and JM Swank, while it also executed Lamb Weston’s (LW  -  Free Report) spin-off in 2016. Further, on May 31, 2018, Conagra divested its Trenton, MO, production facility, owing to which the company’s Foodservice segment exited a co-manufacturing arrangement.While these moves reflect Conagra Brands’ focus on discontinuing with underperforming or non-strategic ventures, the company also remains committed toward strengthening operations by acquiring businesses with solid growth potential. The most recent example in this connection is Conagra’s definitive deal to acquire Pinnacle Foods (PF  -  Free Report), which is expected to close by the end of 2018.Notably, the combined giant is likely to be the second largest player in the frozen foods space. The consolidation of these food companies is likely to create a robust portfolio of leading, iconic and on-trend brands, which will help the combined entity speed up innovation and exploit the long-term benefits in the frozen foods space. The companies’ complementary portfolios, cultures and supply chain are likely to ease Pinnacle Foods’ integration into Conagra, which has a solid strategic buyout record.To top it, Conagra anticipates to generate annual run-rate cost synergies of roughly $215 million, by the end of fiscal 2022. Also, Conagra Brands expects this deal to augment fiscal 2020 bottom-line growth by low-single digits, while adjusted EPS growth in fiscal 2022 is expected to receive a high single-digit boost. Clearly, this combination is likely to be a deemed fit, especially at a time when demand for the frozen foods and snacks category is perking up.Apart from this, the company acquired Angie's Artisan Treats, LLC in October 2017, which should strengthen its snacking business. Also, Sandwich Bros’ buyout (completed in February 2018) is expected to underpin Conagra Brands’ frozen business. Clearly, these endeavors are likely to aid Conagra’s transformation into a pure-play branded food company.Nevertheless, investors can count on MEDIFAST INC (MED  -  Free Report), a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock, which has delivered positive earnings surprises in the past three quarters.

"
188,CAG,"Conagra Brands, Inc. (CAG  -  Free Report) was in the limelight yesterday, courtesy of two major developments. The company posted better-than-expected results for fourth-quarter fiscal 2018, while it also announced a definite deal to acquire Pinnacle Foods Inc. (PF  -  Free Report).Well, Conagra’s shares tumbled 7.3% yesterday, taking this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) stock’s year-to-date performance to a decline of nearly 5% compared with the industry’s decline of 6.1%. Let’s delve deeper into Conagra’s fourth-quarter performance.Better-than-Expected Earnings & SalesIn the fiscal fourth quarter, Conagra’s quarterly adjusted earnings from continuing operations came in at 50 cents, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 43 cents. Notably, this marked the company’s fourth consecutive earnings beat. The bottom line also came in 35.1% higher than the year-ago tally, courtesy of higher gross margin, lower share count and reduced effective tax rate. Notably, operating profit grew across all segments.Conagra Brands Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Conagra Brands Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Conagra Brands Inc. Quoteonagra generated net sales of $1,966.2.5 million, which advanced 5.6% year over year and came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,940 million. Sales were driven by contributions from buyouts and favorable currency movements. Continued strength in Refrigerated & Frozen and Grocery & Snacks segments, in particular, also drove sales.Further, organic sales rose 2%, courtesy of robust growth in both retail and domestic units. Also, each segment witnessed improved pricing and mix, which offset continued retailer marketing investments to support brand saliency, improved distribution and customer trials.Gross Margin ImprovesAdjusted gross profit jumped 6.1% to $573 million with the adjusted gross margin expanding 12 basis points to 29.2%. The upside came on the back of better price/mix, benefits from buyouts and solid supply-chain productivity. This was somewhat negated by elevated input and transportation costs.Segmental DetailsGrocery & Snacks: The segment’s quarterly sales came in at $803 million, up 7.1% year over year. Duke’s, BIGS and Angie's BOOMCHICKAPOP acquisitions contributed nearly 600 bps to net sales growth. Organic sales grew 1.1%. While volumes dipped 0.3%, price/mix climbed 1.4%. Price/mix was fueled by mix gains from recent innovations and better pricing, which together compensated for retailer marketing investments to support brand saliency, improved distribution and customer trials.Refrigerated & Frozen: Net sales jumped 7.9% to $691 million, as Sandwich Bros.’ buyout contributed about 270 bps to net sales growth. Organic sales increased 5.2%. Markedly, volumes and price/mix increased 2.9% and 2.3%, respectively.  Volumes were backed by focus on innovation in certain categories and key business growth, while price/mix gained from both better net pricing and mix.International: Net sales climbed 2% to $209 million, largely driven by favorable currency movements. However, sales slipped 0.6% on an organic basis. Volumes fell 2.5%, whereas price/mix grew 1.9%, owing to strength in Conagra’s ongoing value over volume strategy.Foodservice: The segment’s quarterly sales summed $264 million, down 1.2% year over year. Volumes went down 5.4% on account of the company’s focus on its value over volume strategy. Price/mix rose 4.2%, on the back of favorable product mix and better pricing to counter inflation.Other Financial FundamentalsAdvertising and promotion (A&P) costs were 21.2% lower at $59 million, as management continues to shift investments from A&P marketing to the aforementioned retailer marketing.Conagra exited the fiscal fourth quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $128 million, senior long-term debt (excluding current portion) of $3,035.6 million and total stockholders’ equity of $3,756.6 million. In fiscal 2018, Conagra generated net cash of $919.7 million from operating activities (continued operations).During the fourth quarter, Conagra repurchased nearly 3 million common stock for $107 million, while it paid quarterly dividend per share of 21.25 cents. Further, management intends to retain its existing annual dividend per share rate during fiscal 2019, owing to Pinnacle Foods’ buyout. Also, in May, the company unveiled a new buyback plan, authorizing additional buybacks of about $1 billion.Other Developments Conagra announced a final deal to acquire all shares of Pinnacle Foods for nearly $10.9 billion. The transaction is expected to conclude by the end of 2018.Management expects to conclude the sale of its Canadian Del Monte processed fruit and vegetable business to Bonduelle Group in July 2018. Also, on May 31, Conagra divested its Trenton, MO, production facility. Owing to this sale, the company’s Foodservice segment exited a co-manufacturing arrangement that garnered net sales of nearly $79 million in fiscal 2018. This divestiture is likely to hurt organic sales of this segment as well as the overall company in fiscal 2019.Fiscal 2019 & Q1 OutlookConagra plans to adopt Accounting Standard Update (ASU) 2017-07 in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. While this will impact the company’s adjusted operating profit, the new standard will not affect Conagra’s reported net income.In fiscal 2019, reported net sales are anticipated to increase 0.5-1.5%. Organic sales are expected to increase in a bracket of 1-2%, excluding the impacts from sale of Trenton facility and associated Foodservice business’s exit.Adjusted gross margin is expected in a range of 29.7-30.0%, while input cost inflation is guided between 3.0% and 3.2%. Management projects adjusted operating margin in a band of 15.0-15.3%, which reflects the impacts of the abovementioned adoption of new accounting standard. Effective tax rate is likely to be in the range of 23-24%.Q1 ViewReported net sales is anticipated to increase by 2.0% to 2.5%, while adjusted operating margin is expected to come in a range of 14.1-14.4%.Finally, Conagra envisions adjusted earnings in a range of 46-49 cents per share for the first quarter compared to the year-ago period earnings of 46 cents. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first quarter earnings is currently pegged higher at 55 cents.Check Out These Solid Food StocksMEDIFAST INC (MED  -  Free Report), a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock, has delivered positive earnings surprises in the past three quarters.

189,CAG,"Conagra Brands, Inc. (CAG  -  Free Report), which delivered better-then-expected results for fourth-quarter fiscal 2018, announced a final deal to acquire all shares of Pinnacle Foods Inc. (PF  -  Free Report) for nearly $10.9 billion. Though the buyout is likely to create a robust frozen foods entity, Conagra’s investors appear to be somewhat unenthusiastic.Evidently, Conagra’s shares tumbled 7.3% yesterday, taking this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) stock’s year-to-date performance to a decline of nearly 5% compared with the industry’s decline of 6.1%.Transaction in DetailThe transaction, which will be carried out through a combination of cash and stock, is expected to conclude by the end of 2018, subject to the consent of Pinnacle Foods’ shareholders and other regulatory approvals. It looks like Conagra’s investors’ sentiments were impacted by the stock part of the transaction.Per the deal terms, stockholders of Pinnacle Foods will receive $43.11 per share in cash along with 0.6494 shares of Conagra for each Pinnacle Foods share. That said, Conagra plans to sponsor the deal with equity of nearly $3.0 billion issued to Pinnacle Foods shareholders as well as cash consideration of nearly $7.9 billion is expected to be financed through debt and other sources.Nevertheless, Pinnacle Foods’ buyout will bring its iconic brands under Conagra’s umbrella, thereby fueling the latter’s multi-year transformation plan and strengthening its presence in the booming frozen foods and snacks space.Prospects From the DealConagra is most likely to gain from the addition of Pinnacle Foods, which boasts annual net sales of more than $3 billion. Pinnacle Foods’ renowned brands, including Birds Eye, Duncan Hines, Earth Balance, EVOL and Glutino, among others, will expand Conagra’s scope in the fast-growing frozen foods and snacks space.The consolidation of these food companies is likely to create a robust portfolio of leading, iconic and on-trend brands, which will help the combined entity speed up innovation and exploit the long-term benefits. Further, given that Pinnacle Foods and Conagra Brands are two of the fastest-growing consumer packaged food firms (by consumption), the deal is expected to enhance Conagra’s growth momentum.The companies’ complementary portfolios, cultures and supply chain, is likely to ease Pinnacle Foods’ integration into Conagra, which has a solid strategic buyout record. Coming to numbers, Conagra anticipates to generate annual run-rate cost synergies of roughly $215 million, by the end of fiscal 2022. In this regard, the company expects one-time costs of nearly $355 million, which includes anticipated capital expenditures of nearly $150 million.Also, Conagra Brands expects this deal to augment fiscal 2020 adjusted earnings per share growth by low-single digits. Further, Conagra’s bottom-line in the year ended May 2022 is expected to receive a high single-digit boost from this consolidation.  Markedly, Conagra intends to retain its existing annual dividend per share rate during fiscal 2019, owing to Pinnacle Foods’ buyout. Further, the company stated that it will make buybacks under its current authorization as and when it is appropriate, given its focus on prioritizing leverage goals.All said, we expect this combination to be a deemed fit, especially at a time when demand for the frozen foods and snacks category is perking up.  Check Out These Solid Food StocksMEDIFAST INC (MED  -  Free Report), a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock, has delivered positive earnings surprises in the past three quarters.

190,CAG,"Note: The following is an excerpt from this week’sEarnings Trends report. You can access the full report that contains detailed historical actual and estimates for the current and following periods, please click here>>>Here are the key points:•    Early Q2 results have started coming out, with total earnings for the 15 S&P 500 members that have reported fiscal May-quarter results up +41.7% on +13.2% higher revenues. The proportion of these early reporters beating EPS and revenue estimates is tracking above other recent periods.  •    For the S&P 500 index as a whole, total Q2 earnings are expected to be up +19% from the same period last year on +8.2% higher revenues, with 10 of the 16 Zacks sectors expected to have double-digit earnings growth.•    Earnings growth in the last earnings season (20018 Q1) reached its highest level in more than 7 years at +24.5% on +8.7% revenue gains.•    Q2 estimates moved up modestly since the quarter got underway, in contrast to the very strong positive revisions we saw ahead of the start of the start of the Q1 earnings season.•    Q2 estimates for the Energy, Construction, and Basic Materials sectors went up since the quarter got underway, while estimates for the Consumer Discretionary, Consumer Staples, Autos, and Conglomerate sectors went down.•    Tech sector earnings are expected to be up +24.1% on +10.7% higher revenues, which would follow +31.1% earnings growth on +13.1% revenue growth in Q1. Finance sector earnings are expected to be up +18.2% from the same period last year on +3.5% higher revenues.•    Other major sectors with strong expected growth in Q2 include Energy (+140% earnings growth), Basic Materials (+53.9%), Industrial Products (+24.6%) and Retail (+17.9%). The Autos and Conglomerates sectors are the only ones expected to have lower Q2 earnings compared to the year-earlier level.•    For the small-cap S&P 600 index, total Q2 earnings are expected to be up +31% on +9.2% higher revenues, which would follow +27.4% earnings growth on +8.4% revenue growth in 2018 Q1.•    For full-year 2018, total earnings for the S&P 500 index are expected to be up +20.2% on +6.3% higher revenues. For full-years 2019 and 2020, total earnings are expected to be up +9.8% and +9.6%, respectively. Revenues for the index are expected to be increase by +4.6% in 2019, and +4.5% in 2020.•    The implied ‘EPS’ for the index, calculated using current 2018 P/E of 17.6X and index close, as of June 26th, is $156.26. Using the same methodology, the index ‘EPS’ works out to $171.62 for 2019 (P/E of 16X) and $188.18 for 2020 (P/E of 14.6X). The multiples for 2018, 2019 and 2020 have been calculated using the index’s total market cap and aggregate bottom-up earnings for each year.   Q2 earnings season Gets UnderwayThe Q2 earnings season will really get going with the July 13th releases from JPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report), Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) and Citigroup (C  -  Free Report). But the Q2 earnings season has actually gotten underway already, with today’s ConAgra (CAG  -  Free Report) and Lennar (LEN  -  Free Report) reports part of the 15 S&P 500 members that have reported results already.All of these early results are from companies with fiscal quarters ending in May, but they form part of our June-quarter tally. We will have seen such Q2 results from almost two dozen S&P 500 members with fiscal quarters ending in May by the time the big banks come out with results.Total earnings for these 15 index members are up +41.7% on +13.2% higher revenues, with 93.3% beating EPS estimates and 80% beating revenue estimates.It is premature to draw any firm conclusions from this small sample of Q2 results, but two trends nevertheless stand out when we compare the Q2 results from these 15 index members with what these same companies reported in other recent periods.These two standout trends pertain to revenue growth momentum and more numerous EPS surprises, as the comparison charts below show.Q2 Expectations as a WholeTotal Q2 earnings for the S&P 500 index are expected to be up +19% from the same period last year on +8.2% higher revenues, with double-digit earnings growth for 10 of the 16 Zacks sectors, including Finance and Technology. This would be the 3rd quarter in a row of double-digit earnings growth for the index, a trend that is currently expected to continue in the second half of the year as well.Energy sector earnings are expected to more than double from the year-earlier level, up +140%. Excluding the Energy sector, Total Q2 earnings for the rest of the index would be up +15.6%.  The chart below contrasts the expected Q2 earnings growth rate with what was actually achieved in the last 5 quarters and what is expected in the coming three periods.As you can see, the growth picture remains very strong, even though it is expected to decelerate from Q1’s lofty level. The worrying part isn’t the seeming deceleration, but the underwhelming revisions trend for Q2 and beyond. This lack of positive revisions coupled with ongoing strength in the U.S. dollar and questions about the global economy likely provide sufficient grounds for the market’s less-than-enthusiastic reaction to Q1 results.Note: Sheraz Mian manages the Zacks equity research department.

We will have seen such Q2 results from almost two dozen S&P 500 members with fiscal quarters ending in May by the time the big banks come out with results.Total earnings for these 15 index members are up +41.7% on +13.2% higher revenues, with 93.3% beating EPS estimates and 80% beating revenue estimates.It is premature to draw any firm conclusions from this small sample of Q2 results, but two trends nevertheless stand out when we compare the Q2 results from these 15 index members with what these same companies reported in other recent periods.These two standout trends pertain to revenue growth momentum and more numerous EPS surprises, as the comparison charts below show.Q2 Expectations as a WholeTotal Q2 earnings for the S&P 500 index are expected to be up +19% from the same period last year on +8.2% higher revenues, with double-digit earnings growth for 10 of the 16 Zacks sectors, including Finance and Technology. This would be the 3rd quarter in a row of double-digit earnings growth for the index, a trend that is currently expected to continue in the second half of the year as well.Energy sector earnings are expected to more than double from the year-earlier level, up +140%. Excluding the Energy sector, Total Q2 earnings for the rest of the index would be up +15.6%.  The chart below contrasts the expected Q2 earnings growth rate with what was actually achieved in the last 5 quarters and what is expected in the coming three periods.As you can see, the growth picture remains very strong, even though it is expected to decelerate from Q1’s lofty level. The worrying part isn’t the seeming deceleration, but the underwhelming revisions trend for Q2 and beyond. This lack of positive revisions coupled with ongoing strength in the U.S. dollar and questions about the global economy likely provide sufficient grounds for the market’s less-than-enthusiastic reaction to Q1 results.Note: Sheraz Mian manages the Zacks equity research department.

192,CAG,"General Mills, Inc. (GIS  -  Free Report) is slated to release fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Jun 27. This global manufacturer and marketer of branded consumer foods has a mixed earnings surprise record in the trailing four quarters. Let’s see what’s in store for General Mills this time around.General Mills, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  General Mills, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | General Mills, Inc. QuoteFactors Driving General MillsGeneral Mills is likely to benefit from its four key global strategies for fiscal 2018, which are aimed at enhancing the company’s top line. Well, General Mills’ North American Retail segment has been facing sales declines at its U.S. Cereal and U.S. Yogurt businesses, which lingered in the third quarter of fiscal 2018. General Mills, like many other U.S. food producers, has been struggling due to the shift in consumer preference toward natural and organic food. Nonetheless, as part of its key strategies, General Mills is increasing focus on its cereal business and is also restructuring its U.S. Yogurt portfolio through innovations.Analysts polled by Zacks expect sales at the North American Retail segment to increase 1.6% to $2,430 million in the third quarter. Apart from these, the company should also gain from its solid focus on strengthening e-commerce network. Notably, the company expects global e-commerce business to grow in double-digits in near future, the United States. These factors along with General Mills’ consumer-focused innovations and marketing strategies should fuel sales in the quarter to be reported.Cost Savings Versus Cost InflationGeneral Mills’ margins remained soft in the third quarter, as the company is encountering escalated supply-chain expenses, owing to a rise in freight, commodities and operational costs. These headwinds are expected to linger, which is clear from management’s raised input cost inflation outlook for fiscal 2018. The company now expects input cost inflation of 4%, a point greater than the prior guidance. This also led to a lowered operating profit outlook for fiscal 2018, which gives out unfavorable signals for the fourth quarter.Nevertheless, the company remains on track with its cost-savings initiatives like increased efficiency, reduced complexity through SKU optimization, supply-chain optimization and expansion of zero-based budgeting across the business. General Mills earlier announced plans to deliver approximately $390 million in supply-chain productivity savings in fiscal 2018, through its ongoing Holistic Margin Management (HMM) efforts. These along with incremental savings from other restructuring and cost-reduction initiatives should help offset the aforementioned hurdles in the quarter under review.Q4 Estimates in NumbersAnalysts polled by Zacks expect total revenues of $3,918 million, up 2.9% from the year-ago period. The current consensus mark for earnings is pegged at 75 cents, which shows a 2.7% jump from the year-ago period. The estimate has remained stable in the past 30 days.What the Zacks Model UnveilsHowever, our proven model doesn’t show that General Mills is likely to beat bottom-line estimates this quarter. For this to happen, the stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.General Mills fails to meet both, as it has an Earnings ESP of -3.23% and a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Hence, we caution against sell-rated stocks going into earnings announcement.Stocks Poised to Beat Earnings EstimatesHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post earnings beat:Helen of Troy Limited (HELE  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +3.57% and carries a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Conagra Brands Inc. (CAG  -  Free Report), a Zacks #3 Ranked stock, has an Earnings ESP of +0.39%.Pepsico, Inc. (PEP  -  Free Report), a Zacks #3 Ranked company, has an Earnings ESP of +0.15%.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 19X over. Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we're willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation.See Them Free>>

193,CAG,"Shares of Campbell Soup Company (CPB  -  Free Report) rallied 9.4% yesterday on hearsay of a possible takeover by The Kraft Heinz Company (KHC  -  Free Report). While both companies remained silent, sources revealed that Kraft Heinz looks keenly interested in buying Campbell Soup, which has been struggling with its soups and C-Fresh businesses for quite some time.These headwinds have been hurting Campbell’s top line for more than a year now, as a result of which this Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) stock has tumbled 17.7% in a year, wider than the industry’s decline of 7.3%. Also, Campbell is struggling with strained gross margins, due to input cost inflation, escalated supply-chain expenses (particularly in C-Fresh) and promotional spending (especially in Americas Simple Meals and Beverages).These factors, along with a soft C-Fresh performance, led to a disappointing third-quarter fiscal 2018. Unfortunately, management expects its ongoing challenges to persist, which along with its increased investment spending is likely to hurt fiscal 2019 performance. These factors led to a lowered earnings outlook for fiscal 2019.However, during the third-quarter conference call, Campbell’s interim CEO, Keith McLoughlin, revealed plans to bring the company back on track by carrying out a complete review of the company’s strategic plans, portfolio alignment, resource allocation and cost of capital, among others. Per sources, this strategic business review could also include a conceivable divestiture or division of the company’s operations. In fact, there have been speculations that apart from Kraft Heinz, Campbell could also get buyout proposals from General Mills (GIS  -  Free Report), if it puts itself up for sale.As for the alleged buyout by Kraft Heinz, reports suggest that Campbell may not be a strategic fit for the company. This is because Kraft Heinz itself has been struggling with its top line, owing to shift in consumer preference toward natural and organic ingredients over packaged and processed food. Thus, adding Campbell may not solve Kraft Heinz’ top-line issue, though it may augment the latter’s bottom line. Notably, Kraft Heinz has been making constant attempts to enhance its performance, through cost and productivity improvement efforts along with innovation and marketing strategies.All said, let’s see what’s in store for these food companies and if the aforementioned speculations actually surface. Talking of speculations, we had another one on similar lines, last week. Incidentally, there were rounds that Conagra Brands (CAG  -  Free Report) is trying to strike a deal to buy Pinnacle Foods (PF  -  Free Report). If the consolidation materializes, it is likely to create a robust frozen foods entity, at a time when demand for this category is booming. However, both Conagra and Pinnacle Foods remained silent on the matter.While Conagra has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), both Pinnacle Foods and Kraft Heinz carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!                   It could become the mother of all technological revolutions. Apple sold a mere 1 billion iPhones in 10 years but a new breakthrough is expected to generate more than 27 billion devices in just 3 years, creating a $1.7 trillion market.Zacks has just released a Special Report that spotlights this fast-emerging phenomenon and 6 tickers for taking advantage of it.

194,CAG,"There was a lot of hearsay about Conagra Brands, Inc. (CAG  -  Free Report) trying to strike a deal to buy Pinnacle Foods Inc. (PF  -  Free Report), which sent shares of the latter up by 2.3% in yesterday’s trading session. If the consolidation materializes, it is likely to create a robust frozen foods entity at a time when demand for this category is booming. However, both Conagra and Pinnacle Foods have remained silent on the matter.Sources revealed that this is the second time when Conagra approached Pinnacle Foods for a deal, after a failed attempt last year. Apparently, Conagra made an offer to take over Pinnacle Foods last year, though nothing came out of it as the two entities could not settle for a common price.Coming back to yesterday’s development, it looks like the aforementioned deal came shortly after Jana Partners’ stake disclosure in Pinnacle Foods. Well, there were rounds recently that the activist hedge fund, Jana Partners, revealed nearly 9% stake in Pinnacle Foods and had plans to discuss various matters with the company, including a conceivable divestiture. Sources also revealed that per Jana Partners, Pinnacle Foods is well positioned for consolidation, given its solid frozen foods business.  Conagra-Pinnacle Foods Deal ProspectsGiven the surging demand for frozen foods, such a deal seems to be a deemed fit for Conagra, which has been undertaking constant efforts to revamp its business via modernized buyouts and strategic divestitures. Evidently, the company spun off Lamb Weston Holdings (LW  -  Free Report) in 2016 and acquired parents of Angie's Boomchickapop and Duke's meat snacks. The company remains committed toward making brand renovation initiatives investments to strengthen its frozen business, in an attempt to boost sales of Refrigerated & Frozen segment.At such a juncture, buyout of Pinnacle Foods is likely to be beneficial, given its remarkable growth in the frozen foods space. In the first quarter of 2018, sales from Pinnacle Foods’ Frozen segment increased 7.5% to $344.9 million on account of favorable volume/mix, net price realization, currency impacts and earlier Easter timing. Performance of the Frozen segment strongly benefitted from Birds Eye franchise during the quarter, which drove in-market performance. Markedly, Frozen segment represented about 44.2% of the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s total sales. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Also, in the Grocery segment, strong performance of Vlasic pickles, Armour canned meat, and Duncan Hines baking products and syrups business drove sales. Clearly, frozen foods business offers solid growth prospects, which also makes it one of the hottest spots for conducting mergers and acquisitions. This is also evident from Nomad Foods’ (NOMD  -  Free Report) recent contract to acquire UK’s frozen food company, Aunt Bessie’s Limited.All said, let’s wait and see if Conagra actually ends up buying Pinnacle Foods, which will likely gain from the former’s scale, resources and notable presence in the frozen foods category. However, Conagra currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and has been battling input cost inflation that is hurting its margins. Nonetheless, the company’s focus on innovations, brand reinventions and efforts to boost top line should help offset these hurdles. These efforts should fuel further growth at the stock that has gained 1.6% in the past six months, against the industry’s decline of 7.6%.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.      Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

195,CAG,"On Jun 15, we issued an updated research report on premium consumer goods company Conagra Brands, Inc. (CAG  -  Free Report).Inside StoryConagra expects that its unique value-over-volume strategy will help boost the company's top line in the upcoming quarters. Under this, the company ensures that its robust volume performance is not driven by price discounts but by stronger innovation, as well as new merchandising, distribution and consumer trail-related investments. For instance, new investments to strengthen the frozen products business will likely drive the Refrigerated & Frozen segment’s sales, going forward. On the other hand, brand-renovation initiatives executed to reinforce the snacks business will likely aid in improving Grocery & Snacks segment’s near-term sales. Per our estimates, the company’s sales are projected to be up 1.7% in fiscal 2019 (ending May 2019).Moreover, the company expects that robust top-line growth, share-repurchase activities, lower tax rates and divestiture of low margin businesses will likely continue to improve its bottom line in the upcoming quarters. The company currently projects earnings of $2.03-$2.05 per share in fiscal 2018 (ended May 2018), higher than the prior view of $1.84-$1.89 per share.Additionally, Conagra intends to boost its competency by reshaping the company’s portfolio through strategic inorganic moves. For instance, the acquisition of Angie's Artisan Treats, LLC (completed in October 2017) has been strengthening the company’s snacking business. Furthermore, the Sandwich Bros. buyout (completed in February 2018) has been fortifying its frozen products business.The company also remains on track to boost shareholders’ remuneration on the back of dividends and share-buyback offers.Over the last three months, shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have rallied 4.3%, as against the 3.7% loss incurred by the industry. However, Conagra believes input price inflation of nearly 3.7% will continue to depress its near-term margins. Also, other issues such as higher transportation expenses, increased retailer-based marketing investments and costs associated with the integration of newly-acquired businesses might continue to dent margins in the near future.Additionally, Conagra conducts its business in a highly competitive industry. Intense competition increases the bargaining power of consumers and exposes the company to risks of market share loss. Moreover, in order to increase or retain demand from prospective end users, Conagra not only needs to ensure good product quality and prices, but also has to maintain greater corporate transparency by ascertaining health and wellness aspects of products. Maintaining the desired level of transparency often becomes challenging for the company.Stocks to ConsiderMedifast, Inc. (MED  -  Free Report) sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Associated British Foods PLC (ASBFY  -  Free Report) holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Its mission is to be the leading marketer, manufacturer and seller of organic and natural, better-for-you products. Hain is headquartered in Boulder, CO.The company is present in many natural categories, with well-known brands like Earth’s Best, Ella’s Kitchen, Terra, Healthy Valley, Almond Dream, Plainville Farms, Hain Pure Foods, Rudi’s, Arrowhead Mills, and many others.Hain’s recent third quarter was a disappointing one, with earnings and revenues falling short of expectations. The stock is currently sitting at a #5 (Strong Sell) on the Zacks Rank. What’s next for this organic food conglomerate?Disappointing Q3 ResultsLast month, Hain reported third quarter fiscal 2018 results where both its top and bottom line missed consensus estimates. However, both metrics managed to improve year-over-year, with revenues up 8% year-over-year.Net sales in the U.S. fell 3%, but its U.K. and Rest of World divisions outperformed, increasing 19% and 15%, respectively.Gross profits were down 4.4% to $133 million.Additionally, adjusted operating income dropped almost 5%, while adjusted operating margin decreased 110 bps to 8.9%.Earnings Outlook Estimates took a hit in the days following the report.For the current quarter, six analysts cut their outlook in the last 60 days, and the consensus has dipped 29 cents from $0.55 to $0.26 per share.

Net sales are projected to fall in the range of $2.43 billion and $2.5 billion, with U.S. divisional sales expected to remain flat or decline slightly.There is no doubt that HAIN is going through some tough times, but the stock is on a little bit of a bounce back at the moment. While this could be a fake bounce, it could also be a sign of an upcoming turnaround, especially if the company can stick to its current strategic plan.For investors wanting exposure to food stocks, and one with more near-term potential, they should consider Conagra Brands (CAG  -  Free Report), home to popular supermarket brands like Reddi-wip and Marie Callender’s, among many others.

198,CAG,"The J. M. Smucker Company (SJM  -  Free Report) reported fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 results, wherein the top and the bottom lines fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate owing to industry hurdles. Shares of the company lost 7.9% during the pre-market trading session.In fact, the company’s shares have dropped 9% in the past six months compared with the industry’s 10.6% decline.Quarter in DetailsAdjusted earnings of $1.93 per share jumped 7% year over year, though it fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.18.The J. M. Smucker Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  The J. M. Smucker Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | The J. M. Smucker Company QuoteNet sales of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company remained almost flat year over year at $1,781.3 million, while it missed the consensus estimate of $1,807 million. Unfavorable volume/mix hurt net sales by nearly one percentage point, mainly due to weakness across oils, peanut butter and baking categories, somewhat compensated by strength in coffee. However, sales were positively impacted by improved net price realization and favorable currency movements. Markedly, net sales received benefits of $4.6 million owing to favorable currency exchange.Adjusted gross profit climbed 1% to $674.8 million, whereas adjusted gross margin expanded 40 basis points to 37.9%. Adjusted operating income for the quarter increased roughly 3% to $348.3 million, with the adjusted operating margin improving 60 basis points to 19.6%. Adjusted operating income growth was backed by a decline in SD&A costs.Segment PerformanceU.S. Retail Coffee Market: The company's U.S. Retail Coffee Market segment sales came in at $508.2 million, which increased $2.3 million from the prior-year period. This was backed by favorable volume/mix, primarily attributable to Dunkin' Donuts and Folgers brand. This was somewhat countered by lower net price realization at the Folgers brand.Segment profit jumped 4% to $156 million, due to improved volume/mix and lower input costs, somewhat negated by escalated marketing costs and reduced pricing.  U.S. Retail Consumer Foods:  Sales in the segment dipped 2% to $465.3 million. Higher net price realization was more than offset by unfavorable volume/mix, mainly led by Crisco, Jif and Pillsbury brands, partly compensated by Smucker brand gains.Segment profit increased 5% to $114.1 million, as the impact of lower volume/mix was more than offset by improved pricing and costs.U.S. Retail Pet Foods: Net sales dipped $0.9 million to $533.6 million owing to lower volume/mix, mainly due to certain voluntary product recalls. This was partly countered by better net price realization. Segment profit tumbled 13% to $102.1 million owing to unfavorable volume/mix, pricing and costs. Charges associated with product recalls also hurt segment profit.International and Away from Home: Effective May 1, 2017, the company's U.S. Foodservice business was renamed Away From Home.Net sales grew 2% from the prior-year quarter to $274.2 million, courtesy of favorable volume/mix and positive impacts of currency rates.  This was partly countered by lower net price realization. Segment profit rose 2% to $49.6 million, thanks to positive currency impact, reduced marketing costs as well as a net benefit from reduced pricing and expenses.FinancialsSmucker exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $192.6 million, long-term debt of $4,688.5 million and total shareholders’ equity of $7,891.1 million. Cash flow from operations amounted to $314.4 million for the quarter, when the company generated free cash flow of $202.8 million during the quarter. During fiscal 2018, Smucker generated free cash flow of $896.1 million.Fiscal 2019 OutlookManagement remains focused on placing its portfolio for growth. The company has been undertaking innovations to cater to the evolving consumer demand. Evidently, Smucker introduced 1850 premium coffee and Jif PowerUps, recently. Also, Smucker’s buyout of Ainsworth has solidified its pet foods portfolio. Moreover, management is considering the sale of its U.S. baking business, which highlights its strategy of portfolio optimization and shifts focus to the growing coffee, snacking, and pet food categories. Smucker also remains on track with its cost-containment plans, which helped it make investments in its core growth brands including Dunkin' Donuts, Smucker's Uncrustables and Nature's Recipe.All said, the company expects net sales for fiscal 2019 to advance 13% year over year to reach $8.3 billion.The company envisions fiscal 2019 earnings in the range of $8.40-$8.65 per share, up from $7.96 recorded in fiscal 2017. The upside is likely to be backed by gains from Ainsworth buyout, cost-saving efforts and benefits from U.S. tax reforms. Evidently, effective tax rate for fiscal 2019 is expected to be roughly 24.5%, lower than the fiscal 2018 rate of 29.6%.However, increased marketing costs, rising freight and raw material costs, and increased interest expenses are likely to weigh on bottom line. Incidentally, the company expects marketing costs to rise considerably, particularly to support the launches of 1850 coffee and Jif PowerUps.Free cash flow is projected to be approximately $800-$850 million. Capital expenditures are expected to be $350-$370 million in fiscal 2019.Don’t Miss These Food StocksMEDIFAST INC (MED  -  Free Report), a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company, has delivered positive earnings surprises in the past three quarters.

This is primarily because of lower-than-expected first-quarter 2018 net sales as well as trimmed sales and comps guidance for the full year.Three Factors That Hurt the StockSoft CompsThis Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company generated net sales of $1,287 million, lagging the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,289 million.

200,CAG,"Coty Inc. (COTY  -  Free Report) has been off investors’ radar for a while now, mainly due to persistent softness at its Consumer Beauty segment. In fact, strength at its Luxury and Professional Beauty businesses have not been enough to save this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) stock that has lost 26.2% in the past six months as against the industry’s 8.7% increase.Coty’s Consumer Beauty segment, which constituted nearly 46% of the company’s top line in the third quarter of fiscal 2018, has been posting soft organic sales for the past few quarters. The segment remained pressurized in the third quarter as well, wherein organic sales dropped 4.4%, which is much wider than a 1.3% dip recorded in the previous quarter. Consumer Beauty also witnessed a 19.9% plunge in adjusted operating income, which came in at $97.3 million.Results in the third quarter were hurt by weak brands and pricing actions undertaken in Brazil. Also, persistent softness in the global mass beauty market and intense competition have been significant deterrents. Talking of competition, the beauty products industry is highly competitive with the number of competitors and degree of competition varying widely from country to country.To this end, Coty faces competition from various products and product lines, in both domestic and international markets. Coty competes against products sold to consumers by other direct-selling and direct-sales companies and through the internet. It also contests against products sold through the mass market and prestige retail channels.Apart from this, the Consumer Beauty segment has been consistently witnessing underlying challenges in North America and Europe. As Consumer Beauty forms a significant part of Coty’s business, softness in this segment weighed on the company’s overall organic sales. Incidentally, organic sales of this cosmetic big-wig rose just 0.2% in the third quarter of fiscal 2018, as robust growth in Luxury and continued strength in Professional Beauty segment was countered by a modest fall in Consumer Beauty organic sales.Markedly, management has been undertaking solid efforts to improve the segment’s performance. In this regard, relaunch of various key brands like Clairol Nice 'n Easy has also helped the unit to some extent. While the segment is showing some signs of improvement, full recovery is likely to take time.Nervous About Coty? Check These Solid BetsInter Parfums, Inc.

201,CAG,"Church & Dwight Co., Inc.’s (CHD  -  Free Report) consumer international segment has been performing well for quite some time now, thereby driving its top line.In first-quarter 2018, overall international sales surged 26.3%, driven by recent acquisitions, broad-based sales growth for household and personal care products, and improvements in export business. Notably, the segment received considerable impetus from OXICLEAN in the export business — STERIMAR, ARM & HAMMER toothpaste and OXICLEAN in Mexico, and FEMFRESH and BATISTE in Australia. Well, ARM & HAMMER remains the company’s biggest international brand, which is well placed to grow further in emerging markets.In fact, the international consumer business has been a growth driver over the past few years and exceeded expectations with 11.8%, 7.4%, 6.2% and 5.8% organic growth in the first, second, third and fourth quarter of 2017, respectively. The company is also opening new offices in order to support increase in export business and expects this business to remain strong.Further, it is making considerable investments in Southeast Asia and China, which is likely to be a major growth driver in future. This is evident from the company’s recent tie-up with DKSH, to make the latter Church & Dwight’s leading distributor in Southeast Asia.Also, the international consumer business has been consistently contributing to organic sales growth of the company. Evidently, organic sales grew 3.8% in the first quarter of 2018. Further, organic sales jumped 2.3%, 1.8%, 3.2% and 3.4% in first, second, third and fourth-quarter 2017, respectively.In the first quarter, organic sales growth was driven by a 4.2% rise in global consumer products growth. This was backed by organic sales growth across both Consumer Domestic and International segment, wherein organic sales rose 3.6% and 6.8%, respectively. Organic sales at Consumer International segment was backed by improved volumes (up 1.6%), along with better price and product mix (up 5.2%).Continued strength at Consumer International along with solid growth in Consumer Domestic businesses drove Church & Dwight’s results in the first quarter. Both top and bottom lines grew year over year and came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Notably, this marked the company’s sixth and third consecutive quarter of positive earnings and sales surprise, respectively. Clearly, the company’s investment spending is paying off. Going forward, the company continues to invest in the international consumer business to sustain its strong sales growth.Let’s see if these factors can fuel growth at this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, which has gained a marginal 0.5% in the past six months, better than the industry that tumbled 7.8%.Interested in Consumer Staples?

202,CAG,"United Natural Foods, Inc. (UNFI  -  Free Report) posted third-quarter fiscal 2018 results, wherein both the top and bottom line improved year over year and surpassed estimates. This marked the fifth and third consecutive quarter of earnings and sales beat for the company, respectively.United Natural Foods, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  United Natural Foods, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | United Natural Foods, Inc. QuoteHowever, net sales and EBITDA growth was somewhat impacted by absence of meaningful inflation. Also, United Natural generated negative free cash flow owing to increased inventory levels. It looks like these factors and some cost hurdles weighed on investors’ sentiment as despite the solid results and raised outlook, shares of the company dropped 6.1% during the after-market trading session.Q3 HighlightsThis distributor of food and non-food products reported third-quarter adjusted earnings of $1.04 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 93 cents and improved 35.1% year over year.Net sales came in at $2,648.9 million, up 11.8% year over year, cruising ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,579 million. The upside was driven by continued rise in product demand.The company’s gross profit rose 11.4% to $408.1 million. However, gross margin fell 5 basis points (bps) to 15.41% on account of an unfavorable shift in consumer mix. Notably, sales from lower-margin customers grew at a higher rate than other customers. Higher inbound freight costs also weighed on gross margin during the quarter.Adjusted operating income grew 19.5% to $82.3 million.  Further, the company’s adjusted EBITDA improved 15.1% to $104 million.Segment SalesFrom a channel point of view, supernatural net sales surged 24.3% year over year, which marked the highest-ever year-over-year growth rate at this channel in more than five years.

Thus, United Natural used free cash flow of roughly $34.1 million.Fiscal 2018 GuidanceManagement is impressed with the business performance during the quarter, with consistent broad-based improvement across all important sales networks. The company’s solid market position helps it grow even amid a changing retail landscape.With sophisticated distribution networks and fulfillment centers, United Natural’s growth in the omnichannel arena is quite remarkable. Further, the company believes that it is well placed for growth, considering consumers’ solid demand for United Natural’s better-for-you food products and services. It also expects that effective sourcing strategies and acquisitions will aid the company meet long-term strategic objectives.Notably, United Natural Foods’ impressive earnings history and focus on strategic endeavors have helped this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock gain 5.6% in the past three months against the industry’s decline of 6.7%.  However, the company has been incurring higher labor expenses across several distribution centers, owing to increased growth from the year-ago period. Also, inbound fill rates related to the strong expected demand remains a hurdle. Nonetheless, United Naturals is focused on enhancing supply chain networks to better align supplies with demand.All said, management raised its previously issued sales and earnings view for fiscal 2018, projecting net sales in the range of $10.23-$10.28 billion compared with the previous band of $10.01-$10.16 billion. The updated outlook depicts growth of 10.3%-10.8% from fiscal 2017 sales figure.Management now envisions adjusted earnings for fiscal 2018 in the range of $3.18-$3.23 per share, up from $3.06-$3.14 forecasted earlier. The latest outlook depicts a year-over-year increase of 23.6%-25.6%, better than the prior expectation of 19.5%-22.7%.

203,CAG,"Molson Coors Brewing Company (TAP  -  Free Report) has been off investors’ radar for quite some time now, owing to persistent softness in U.S. beer volumes and escalated input costs. Given these factors, this Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) stock has lost 20.5% in the past three months, wider than the industry’s 8.7% decline.These hurdles also weighed on Molson Coors’ first-quarter 2018 results, following which the company has seen its shares tumble 13.5%. So, let’s delve deep into these obstacles and see if they are likely to persist.Will Molson Coors Remain Troubled?Molson Coors has been posting weak beer volumes in the United States for quite some time, owing to tough industry conditions. Consumers’ changing preferences, aging population and strong competition from other alcohol beverages have been the main contributors to the decline. During the first quarter of 2018, Molson Coors continued to witness softness in the U.S. beer industry hurting overall top and bottom line of the company.During the quarter, the U.S. region reported net sales decline of 5.8% to $1,647.8 million, with U.S. brand volumes down 3.8% accountable to soft Premium Light volumes. Also, sales-to-wholesalers volume (STWs) remained soft, which declined 6.7% mainly as a result of overall U.S. industry headwinds and unfavorable timing of wholesale inventories. The segment’s underlying EBITDA also plunged 12.2% to $388.9 million, thanks to reduced STW volumes, COGS inflation, unfavorable mix sales and reduced volumes.Apart from this, the company has been battling input cost inflation for a while now, especially due to aluminum and fuel costs. Management expects these hurdles to linger in 2018. The company reiterated its previously issued COGS per hectare outlook for the United States and Canada.For 2018, the company expects cost of goods sold per hectoliter to increase in low-single-digits across these segments. In fact, it anticipates increased cost pressure in Europe now, owing to rising costs of key inputs like aluminum and higher freight and fuel expenses. Clearly, these hurdles remain a concern for Molson Coors’ bottom line.The aforementioned challenges dented Molson Coors in the first quarter, wherein both top and bottom lines dropped year over year and missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Other than these hindrances, unfavorable global mix, impact of indirect tax provision cycling in Europe and adoption of a new revenue recognition accounting standard hurt the company’s performance. Management retained its outlook and expects 2018 to remain impacted by new revenue recognition standard.Although Molson Coors’ focus on premiumization and cost savings initiatives bode well, the U.S. beer industry softness and tough input cost environment seems to have marred analysts’ confidence. Evidently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the second quarter and 2018 has gone down from $1.98 to $1.93 and from $5.16 to $4.89, respectively over the past 60 days.Still Looking for Consumer Staples Stocks?

204,CAG,"Conagra Brands, Inc. (CAG  -  Free Report) is slated to release fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Jun 28. This leading branded food company in North America delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 6.7% in the trailing four quarters. Let’s see what’s in store for Conagra this time around.Conagra Brands Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Conagra Brands Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Conagra Brands Inc. Quote Value-Over-Volume Strategy to Drive SalesConagra is likely to continue gaining from its value-over-volume strategy, which is aimed at driving the top line. Under this regime, Conagra ensures that its robust volume performance is not driven by price discounts but by stronger innovation, as well as new merchandising, distribution and consumer trail-related investments.For instance, new investments to strengthen frozen business will likely boost sales of Refrigerated & Frozen segment, going forward. On the other hand, brand renovation initiatives, executed to reinforce snacks business, would likely aid in improving Grocery & Snacks segment’s near-term sales. Moreover, the company believes favorable foreign currency translation impact will bolster its revenues in the quarters ahead. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of Grocery & Snacks and Refrigerated & Frozen segments are pegged at $789 million and $671 million, compared to the year-ago period tally of $749 million and $640 million, respectively.We also expect acquisitions to keep benefiting Conagra’s sales. Incidentally, buyouts of brands like Angie’s, Sandwich Bros, and Duke’s and Bigs fueled third-quarter fiscal 2018 sales growth by 240 basis points. We expect these factors to augment Conagra’s fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 top line, thereby continuing the year-over-year growth trend.Cost Inflation Remains a WorryHowever, Conagra’s gross margin remained under pressure in the fiscal third quarter, due to increased cost of sales (mainly above the line marketing investments) and input cost inflation (of 3.7%). Input cost inflation mainly stemmed from higher packaging and transportation expenses.Though SG&A expenses and A&P costs reduced year over year, gross margin contraction more than offset these factors and led to lower adjusted operating margin. Unfortunately, input cost inflation is likely to remain a hurdle in the quarter to be reported. Nevertheless, focus on innovations and efforts to boost top line should help offset these hurdles and cushion the bottom line, which is also likely to gain from lower tax rates.Q4 Estimates in NumbersAnalysts polled by Zacks expect total revenues of $1,939 million, up more than 4% from the year-ago period. The current consensus mark for earnings is pegged at 43 cents, which shows a 16.2% jump from the year-ago period. The estimate remained unchanged in the past 30 days.What the Zacks Model UnveilsHowever, our proven model doesn’t show that Conagra is likely to beat bottom-line estimates this quarter.  For this to happen, the stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Though Conagra has an Earnings ESP of +0.39%, the company carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). We caution against sell-rated stocks going into earnings announcement.Stocks Poised to Beat Earnings EstimatesHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post earnings beat:Helen of Troy Limited (HELE  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +3.57% and carries a Zacks Rank #2.

205,CAG,"The food industry has underperformed the broader market in a year’s time as the industry has been struggling in the face of numerous issues. Again, the industry currently ranks among the bottom 20% of all Zacks industries, signifying that industry-level factors will continue to be unfavorable.With obesity ballooning into a major heath issue in America, consumers are desperately looking for food with health benefits. They are cutting back on food items that contain artificial flavor, color, sodium and saturated fat. Also, food items proven to contain traces of pesticides, genetically modified organisms and antibiotics are consciously avoided. Hence, with an increasing number of Americans choosing healthier lifestyle practices, packaged food companies are finding it hard to survive.Meanwhile, this rising health awareness is not going down well with companies selling snacks and packaged food products. Companies like Kellogg Company (K  -  Free Report), General Mills, Inc. (GIS  -  Free Report), Mondelez International (MDLZ  -  Free Report) have been facing top-line weakness over the past several quarters. Along with a shift in preference, increased price consciousness among consumers is acting against the industry.All is Not LostPer the Organic Trade Association, organic food now accounts for more than 5% of total food sales in the United States. Organic food sales increased 6.4% from last year in 2017. Sales are expected to rise further this year, largely banking on innovation and product launches. The organic food and beverages market is expected to grow at a rate of 14% from 2017 to 2021, per the latest market research report by Technavio.Needless to say, it makes it pertinent for food companies to comply with changing preferences to regain footing. Food companies are aggressively trying to improve their products through innovation as well as acquisitions and divestitures. They are channeling funds toward product and packaging innovation as well as reformulating a number of existing products to meet rapidly changing consumer view on health and wellness. Apart from this, companies have adopted multi-year restructuring initiatives with focus on improving operational efficiency to generate cost savings.Again, some companies are opting for co-branding to boost sales. Cereal Partners Worldwide deserves a special mention here. General Mills formed a joint venture with Nestle called Cereal Partners Worldwide, which serves customers in more than 130 global markets. Mondelez International teamed up yet again with the third-largest cereal company in the United States, Post Consumer Brands, to create two cookie-inspired breakfast cereals.Moreover, the overall economy appears to be in good shape, driven by an improved labor market, higher consumer spending, rising consumer confidence and increased business investments.Making the Right ChoiceSeveral food companies defy all odds on varied endeavors like product innovation and co-branding to keep up with evolving trends. Using the Zacks Stock Screener, we have zeroed in on three food stocks that have been performing well. We have ensured that the selected stocks possess a  Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) with other relevant metrics. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Medifast, Inc. (MED  -  Free Report) sports a Zacks Rank #1. Shares of the company have gained more than 200% against the industry’s loss of 18.5% in the past year. Moreover, the company is witnessing upward estimate revisions — 12.3% for 2018 and 18.6% for 2019 — in the last 60 days. This reflects that analysts are optimistic about the stock’s prospects. Per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, EPS growth is at 59.4% and sales growth at 30.9% for 2018. Again, EPS is projected to grow nearly 15% in the next three to five years.The Chefs' Warehouse, Inc. (CHEF  -  Free Report) carries a Zacks Rank #2. The stock has gained around 82% in the past year. Though estimates have been stable over the last 60 days, earnings are expected to grow a solid 65.9% in 2018. Again, EPS is projected to rise nearly 22% in the next three to five years. Meanwhile, the company’s Value Score of B reflects that there is upside potential for the stock.Conagra Brands, Inc. (CAG  -  Free Report) has a Zacks Rank #2. Earnings are expected to grow a solid 17.8% in 2018. Again, EPS is likely to grow nearly 8% in the next three to five years. Meanwhile, the company’s Value Score of B reflects that there is more room to run for the stock.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

206,CAG,"Tyson Foods, Inc (TSN  -  Free Report), which is bent on expanding its protein-rich products, revealed plans to acquire Tecumseh Poultry LLC, a renowned branded organic chicken producer. The deal will add the popular air-chilled Smart Chicken brand along with a variety of chicken sausages, fresh and deli-style chicken to Tyson Foods’ portfolio. Tecumseh Poultry’s operations are mainly carried out through two plants in Nebraska, which will now form part of Tyson Foods’ business.Tecumseh Poultry: Another Bountiful AdditionWell, this news came in just after the company announced the sale of non-protein business — Van’s and Sara Lee Frozen Bakery. Notably, Tyson Foods’ latest move underscores its constant efforts to expand protein-rich offerings, as the demand for such products has been growing and is expected to rise further. Along with the widening demography of protein-savvy consumers, consumers’ demand for fresh and organic food options have been growing rapidly, courtesy of rising health consciousness.Considering these factors, Tyson Foods’ latest move to bring Tecumseh Poultry under its wings fits well and is expected to adequately bolster the company’s organic chicken offerings. Markedly, Tecumseh Poultry uses air-chilling techniques to process chicken, a method that is monitored by the USDA and is considered safe. Moreover, the Smart Chicken brand is quite popular and holds a strong market position in the fresh chicken category. Management stated that Tecumseh Poultry, will be operated as a separate wholly-owned subsidiary. Apart from this, the company’s organic products include brands such as Aidells and NatureRaised Farms. Other Strides in Bolstering Protein OfferingsTyson Foods’ growing appetite for protein-rich products has propelled the company to constantly strike new deals to augment protein-packed offerings. In addition to expanding organic foods, the company has been venturing into alternative sources for meat and protein products, evident from the buyouts of Beyond Meat and Memphis Meats. Further, the company has made several investments to strengthen poultry production in Tennessee. Such efforts, combined with the acquisition of AdvancePierre and Original Philly, indicate the company’s dedicated efforts on augmenting protein-rich food products.Driven by such fruitful ventures, Tyson Foods’ Chicken, Beef and Prepared Foods segments have been delivering a solid performance since the past few quarters. Management expects demand for protein to continue rising and is on track to make most of all opportunities in the space. Such efforts have also been boosting investors’ confidence in this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock that has rallied 15.5% in the past year compared with the industry’s 4.9% gain. That said, we expect the latest inclusion of Tecumseh Poultry to reward and further augment the company’s performance.Greedy for More Consumer Staples Stocks?

207,CAG,"If market hearsays are to be believed, activist hedge fund investor Jana Capital Partners LLC has been in talks with renowned food company, Pinnacle Foods Inc. (PF  -  Free Report), for restructuring and for considering the possibility of a divestiture.  In fact, sources revealed that Jana Capital has procured a 9.1% stake in Pinnacle foods.While the latest buzz keeps the future of Pinnacle Foods under veils, investors look quite excited. Evidently, shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company gained almost 10% on Apr 20. On that note, let’s take a closer look at how the decision might impact the company.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.What to Expect from Jana Capital?Jana Capital’s big plans with Pinnacle foods includes undertaking several value creation measures such as optimizing costs, margins as well as capital allocation. These measures are likely to aid the company in offsetting heightened operating expenses, stemming from higher product introductory costs, logistics and packaging along with the anticipated input cost inflation for 2018.Speculations also suggest that Jana Capital’s supposed plans are directed toward developing firmer grounds for Pinnacle foods’ merger with Conagra Brands Inc. (CAG  -  Free Report). Previously, Conagra was interested in acquiring Pinnacle Foods but talks in this regard were stalled due to disagreements between the parties. Incidentally, Jana Capital also holds investments in Conagra.With the activist investor’s involvements in the companies, talks of a merger between these food players are likely to be back on the table soon. If at all such probabilities are put to action, it would lead to the joining of two strongly performing food manufacturers, significantly raising the competition bar for other players in the industry.Well, Jana Capital holds quite a fame for probing into the food sector and stirring up massive changes. In 2017, the company purchased stakes in Whole Foods Market and implemented several changes in its board and operations, before it got acquired by Amazon Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report). The company initiated several changes at Bloomin’ Brands, Inc. (BLMN  -  Free Report), which helped it gain a board seat in the latter. Business Fundamentals Boost Investors’ OptimismPinnacle Foods boasts of a strong market position, a possible factor that might have caught Jana Capital’s interest in the company. Notably, with its fourth-quarter 2017 results, the company marked its 15th straight quarter and sixth consecutive year of market share growth, mainly fueled by the Duncan Hines and Birds Eye businesses.Incidentally, Pinnacle Foods has been bolstering its market share and products-line through well-chalked acquisitions. In fact, during 2017, the company gained synergies of $16 million from the Boulder Brands acquisition. Other than this, the acquisitions of Duncan Hines manufacturing business and Garden Protein have also yielded favorably.Courtesy of such efforts, combined with acquisition synergies, constant innovations and benefits from the network optimization program, the company expects productivity for 2018 to be 4-4.5% of costs of products sold. Further, it expects results to be stronger and anticipates gross margin improvement of 300-400 basis points (bps) by 2020.Indeed, such constant growth endeavors combined with a positive outlook for 2018 has been fueling investors’ optimism in the stock. Well, the stock has gained 9.1% in the past six months, while the industry declined 7.8%.Moreover, we expect that if the rumored plans with Jana Capital materialize, it will undoubtedly add to the strength of Pinnacle Foods in the industry. On that note, let’s wait and see in which direction the company moves in the forthcoming periods and whether such bold moves will drive its stock higher.   Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

208,CAG,"Tyson Foods, Inc (TSN  -  Free Report) recently entered into an agreement with private-equity firm — Kohlberg & Company — to sell its Sara Lee Frozen Bakery and Van’s businesses. The deal will include the sale of brands such as Chef Pierre, Bistro Collection, Van’s brands and license usage rights of Sara Lee brand across certain channels. It also comprises wind-up of two prepared foods facilities located in Tarboro and Traverse City as well as sales office in Canada.Industry experts view the deal as part of the company’s strategy to focus on protein-packed brands.Greater Focus on Protein Brands Bodes WellWell, Tyson Foods’ growing appetite for protein-rich products has propelled the company to divest non-protein businesses. Apart from Sara Lee and Vans businesses, the company earlier divested its Kettle business and is also on the look-out for potential buyers for its pizza crust unit.Although Tyson Foods continues to reduce non-protein offerings, it constantly strikes new deals to augment protein-packed offerings. In fact, the company has been venturing into alternative sources for meat and protein products, as evident from the buyouts of Beyond Meat and Memphis Meats. Apart from this, the company has been steadily expanding fresh prepared foods offerings, owing to consumers’ rising demand for natural fresh meat offerings without any added hormones or antibiotics. Further, the company has made several investments to strengthen poultry production in Tennessee. Such efforts, combined with the acquisition of AdvancePierre and Original Philly, indicate the company’s dedicated efforts on augmenting protein-rich food products.Driven by such fruitful ventures, Tyson Foods’ Chicken, Beef and Prepared Foods segments have been depicting a solid performance since the past few quarters. Management expects demand for protein to continue rising and is on track to exploit all opportunities in the space. For fiscal 2018, USDA expects overall domestic protein production (chicken, beef, pork and turkey) to rise roughly 3% year over year.Wrapping it UpWe note that Tyson Foods has been struggling with rising freight costs. Also, the company has been increasing employee investments to improve productivity, which has been bumping up overall costs. Such factors have been weighing on the company’s shares, which declined 7.5% in the past six months compared with the industry’s 4.3% fall.Nevertheless, we expect this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s Financial Fitness Program to induce savings and help alleviate cost-related issues to an extent. Moreover, the planned divestitures are likely to increase focus on key growth areas and utilize resources in the desired channels.Greedy for More Consumer Staples Stocks?

209,CAG,"We issued an updated research report on premium meat products company, Hormel Foods Corporation (HRL  -  Free Report), on May 28. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) but flaunts an attractive VGM Score of A. Strong demand for on-trend branded products is supporting the company’s growth, however, prevalent turkey market challenges remains a headwind.Let’s dig deeper into the basic fundamental factors affecting the stock.Factors Favoring the StockImproving demand for popular brands like Hormel Black Label bacon, SPAM, Muscle Milk and Wholly Guacamole dips is currently driving Hormel Foods revenues. Moreover, the company expects that the Make the Switch campaign this summer will bolster sales of its value-added businesses in the second half of fiscal 2018.The company also intends to strengthen its business on the back of strategic acquisitions. Successful integration of the Fontanini and Columbus buyouts are expected to strengthen Hormel Foods’ business portfolio, going forward.Hormel Foods has been boosting its liquidity on the back of reduced corporate tax rates. In first-half fiscal 2018, the company generated operating cash flows of $443 million, up 58% from the year-ago period, on grounds of lower taxes. Notably, Hormel Foods narrowed its fiscal 2018 tax rate to 17.5-19.5%, from the prior fiscal’s 33.2%, and anticipates to generate cash flow benefit of $100-$140 million in the current fiscal. The company intends to finance its new marketing and capital investment projects with these proceeds.Over the last three months, Hormel Foods shares have rallied 10.8%, as against the 2.1% loss recorded by the industry.Existing SetbacksTurkey market challenges have been hurting revenues and profitability of Hormel Foods’ Jennie-O Turkey Store segment for the past few quarters. The company noted that a supply glut has been affecting the prices of turkey and cold storage meat. Notably, soaring freight expenses and elevated advertising costs also weighed over the segment’s bottom line in second-quarter fiscal 2018. The company stated that surge in fuel prices and scarcity of trucks will continue to escalate freight costs until fiscal 2019.Hormel Foods’ margins are also vulnerable to input price fluctuations. For instance, inflation in the prices of pork bellies and beef trim marred the company’s profitability in fourth-quarter fiscal 2017. In addition, volatilities in the prices of beef, hog and hog sport trim pulled down its margins in first-quarter fiscal 2018. In the fiscal second quarter, Hormel Foods experienced inflation in beef prices and anticipates the same to persist through the remaining of the current fiscal. Moreover, uncertain impact of tariffs on the pork industry remains a major cause of concern.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the Zacks Consumer Staples sector are listed below:B&G Foods, Inc.

This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock is poised to grow on the back of brand modernizing moves, stronger innovation, buyouts, strategic divestments and lower tax rates.Why the Stock is Performing Well?Value-over-Volume Strategy: Conagra is currently following a unique value-over-volume strategy, through which it is prioritizing price/mix metric and margins, instead of volumes. In sync with this, the company ensures that its robust volume performance is driven by stronger innovation, as well as new merchandizing, distribution, and consumer trail-related investments, instead of price discounts.Top-Line Prospects: Sturdy demand for premium brands like Healthy Choice, Marie Callender, Slim Jim, Duke's, Bigs and Frontera is expected to boost Conagra’s revenues in the quarters ahead.Moreover, new investments planned to strengthen its frozen business and brand renovation initiatives undertaken to improve snacks business would likely aid in improving Conagra’s top-line results in the upcoming quarters.Per our estimates, the company’s projected year-over-year sales growth is 1.7% for fiscal 2019.Over the last three months, shares of the company have rallied 4.2%, as against the 9.2% loss recorded by the industry.Inorganic Moves: Conagra intends to boost its competency by acquiring high-margin businesses and divesting the less-profitable ones. For instance, the strategic acquisition of Angie's Artisan Treats, LLC (completed in October 2017) and Sandwich Bros.

On the other hand, Del Monte’s spin-off will likely be accomplished by the end of this month.Improving Profitability: Conagra has pulled off a positive average earnings surprise of 6.73% over the last four quarters. The company’s adjusted earnings in third-quarter fiscal 2018 (ended February 2018) surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 8.9% and also exceeded the year-ago tally by 27.1%.Going forward, Conagra intends to improve its bottom line on robust top-line growth, share repurchase activities, lower tax rates and by exiting low-margin businesses. Notably, the company anticipates to report earnings of 2.03-$2.05 per share for fiscal 2018, higher than the previously estimated range of $1.84-$1.89 per share.Per our estimates, the company’s projected year-over-year earnings growth is 17.8% and 12.7%, for fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019, respectively.Shareholders’ Interest: Conagra is also highly committed toward its shareholders and tries to provide adequate returns to them through dividends and share buyback offers. During third-quarter fiscal 2018, the company repurchased roughly 8 million shares for $280 million. Additionally, the company is on track with its aim to buyback $1.1 billion shares in full-year fiscal 2018.Other Stocks to ConsiderSome other top-ranked stocks in the industry are listed below:Medifast, Inc.

213,CAG,"Smart and successful investors never follow crowd, instead, they focus on extensive research for creating a proper investment strategy. Following the crowd blindly and investing in risky stocks will fetch handsome returns only when the market is bullish.In this article we have presented a strategy which clearly shows that less-risky securities could also reward investors with impressive returns.Beta UnderstandingBeta indicates the volatility of a particular stock with respect to the market. In other words, beta measures the extent of stock price movement relative to the market (we are considering S&P 500 here).If a company has a beta of 1, it means that the relative volatility of the stock is the same as that of the S&P 500. In the same way, if the stock’s beta is greater than 1 then it is more volatile compared to the market. Conversely, a beta below 1 signifies less volatility.Now, if a portfolio’s beta is 3, it is three times more volatile than the market. Hence, if the market is projected to give 20% return, the portfolio will then definitely contribute 60% return which is amazing.However, the opposite case also holds true. If the market slips 20% then the portfolio return plummets 60% which is surely a matter of concern.The Winning StrategyIn our screening criteria we included beta in the range of 0 to 0.6 for short listing low risk stocks. But this can’t be the only criterion for betting on stocks. The other parameters that need to be added to create a winning portfolio are:Percentage Change in Price in the Last 4 Weeks greater than zero: This ensures that the stocks saw positive price movement over the last one month.Average 20 Day Volume greater than 50,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stocks are easily tradable.Price greater than or equal to $5: They must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.Zacks Rank equal to 1: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks indicate that they will significantly outperform the broader U.S. equity market over the next one to three months.Here are five of the 22 stocks that qualified the screening:Based in Nelsonville, OH, Rocky Brands, Inc. (RCKY  -  Free Report) is primarily engaged in designing and marketing finest footwear. The company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the prior four quarters, the average positive earnings surprise being 264.6%.

214,CAG,"Altria Group Inc.’s (MO  -  Free Report) recently-reported first-quarter 2018 results showed continued strength in the bottom line. The quarterly performance also reflected improved revenues in the smokeless category. Nevertheless, lower cigarette volumes remained a drag.  Quarter in DetailsAdjusted earnings of 95 cents per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 93 cents. Earnings also surged 30.1% year over year on the back of greater equity earnings from the company’s beer investments related to AB InBev (BUD  -  Free Report), higher adjusted operating companies income (“OCI”) in the smokeless segments, lower outstanding shares and reduced adjusted tax rate. These positives were partially offset by reduced adjusted OCI in the smokeable unit.Net revenues of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company inched up 0.4% year over year to $6.1 billion, driven by higher revenues in the smokeless segment, largely offset by a drop in the smokeable category. Revenues net of excise taxes improved 1.8% to $4.7 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate was $4.6 million.Also, in the said period, gross profit improved 5.8% from the prior-year quarter to $2,936 million.Altria Group, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Altria Group, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Altria Group, Inc. QuoteSegment DetailsSmokeable Products Segment: Net revenues in the category dropped 0.8% year over year to $5,414 million, thanks to lower volumes and increased promotional spending. These were mostly offset by higher pricing. Revenues net of excise taxes gained 0.4% year over year to $4,013 million.Total shipment volume in the category fell 4.1% from the prior-year quarter. Also, domestic cigarette shipment volumes dropped 4.2% year over year owing to lower cigarette industry volumes and decline in retail share. This was partially compensated by favorable trade inventory movements.  The company has been witnessing declining cigarette volumes for a while now due to stringent government regulations and increased consumer awareness regarding the negative impact of tobacco. Such factors have been weighing on investors’ confidence in the stock. Evidently, shares of the company have plunged 22% in a year, compared to the industry’s decline of 23.4%.Total cigarette retail share declined to 50.3%, representing a 0.7 percentage point slip. This was largely due to a 0.5 share point drop in Marlboro’s retail share owing to an increase in cigarette excise tax in California.Adjusted OCI for the segment declined 2% to $1,995 million due to lower cigarette volumes, strategic investments and higher resolution expenses. These were partially made up for by higher pricing. Additionally, adjusted OCI margins went down 1.2 percentage points to 49.7%.Smokeless Products: Net revenues in the segment rose 12.7% from the year-ago figure to $525 million owing to voluntary recalls made in 2017 and improved pricing. Also, revenues net of excise taxes advanced 13.1% to $493 million in the quarter.Domestic shipment volumes in the category dipped 0.1% to 195.7 million units, mainly accountable to a decline in Skoal volumes, partly compensated by improved Copenhagen volumes. However, total smokeless products retail share gained 0.1 percentage points to 53.8% in the quarter.Adjusted OCI surged 27.3% to $340 million due to voluntary recalls and higher pricing.  Further, adjusted OCI margin expanded 7.8 percentage points to 69%.Wine: Net revenues in the wine category increased 1.4% year over year to $142 million, driven by greater shipment volumes, partially countered by unfavorable mix. The segment’s revenues, net of excise taxes, inched up 0.7% to $137 million. Wine shipment volume improved 6.1% to 1.8 million cases.However, adjusted OCI dropped 19% to $17 million as a result of employee bonuses, partially countered by higher revenues.

215,CAG,"SUPERVALU INC. (SVU  -  Free Report) released fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 results, with the top and bottom line missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, sales improved year on year, buoyed by the sturdy advancement of the company’s wholesale business.However, the retail segment continued to be dismal in the fourth quarter. In fact, this has been weighing on investors’ sentiment for a while. Evidently, shares of this grocery dealer have tumbled 49.7% in the past year, compared with the industry’s decline of 17.2%.Well, the company has been trying to rationalize its retail operations by exiting certain banners. In this regard, alongside fourth-quarter results, management unveiled plans to sell its Shop ‘n Save and Shop ‘n Save East retail businesses. Such moves are expected to aid SUPERVALU to focus on prospective business areas, especially in the wholesale space and raise investor’s optimism in the stock. Also, the company unveiled plans to sell some of its distribution centers to strengthen its financial position. That said, lets delve deeper into the fourth-quarter numbers and see where the company is headed.Q4 in DetailsThe company reported adjusted earnings from continuing operations of 61 cents per share that came below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 77 cents and plunged 23.8% year over year.Although SUPERVALU’s net sales missed the consensus mark of $3,984 million, it advanced 42.1% year over year to 3,594 million during the fourth quarter. The top line gained approximately $840 million from Unified Grocers (acquired in June 2017), whereas AG Florida contributed $130 million. While contributions from these businesses drove results in the wholesale unit, the company’s retail and corporate segment continued to struggle.SUPERVALU INC. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  SUPERVALU INC. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | SUPERVALU INC. QuoteGross profit amounted to $356 million that depicted a 5.3% upside from the prior-year quarter. However, gross margin contracted 350 basis points (bps) to 9.9%, thanks to unfavorable business mix as Wholesale accounted for a bigger portion of total sales. Prior to this, the company witnessed gross margin declines of 310, 280 and 80 bps in the third, second and first quarters of fiscal 2018, respectively.During the quarter, SUPERVALU’s operating earnings from continuing operations came in at $68 million. Further, adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations amounted to $117 million.Segment DetailsWholesale: Net sales at Wholesale business surged 60% year over year to $2,872 million, mainly driven by the sales contributions from Unified Grocers and AG Florida, sales to new customers and greater sales to new stores run by existing customers. These were partially offset by reduced military sales and stores that no longer receive supplies from SUPERVALU.The segment’s adjusted operating income totaled $67 million, up from $60 million in the year-ago quarter. However, adjusted operating margin contracted 110 bps to 2.3% due to lower margins from Unified Grocers.Retail: Net sales in Retail dropped 0.6% to $690 million, on account of store closures — partially offset by a 0.1% gain in identical store sales. Notably identical store sales in this segment, which has been declining year over year for 11 straight quarters, depicted a turnaround for the first time in the reported quarter.Further, the segment reported adjusted operating earnings of $1 million against adjusted operating earnings of $11 million in the year-ago quarter. Adjusted operating margin in the segment declined 130 bps. The downside was a result of lower base margins as well as increased shrink costs.Corporate: During the quarter, fees earned under services agreements were down 23.8% to $32 million. Further, the segment reported break-even adjusted operating earnings against operating loss of $4 million in the prior-year quarter.  Financial UpdateSUPERVALU ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $41 million, long-term debt of $1,724 million and total stockholders’ equity of $507 million as of Feb 24, 2018.Further, the company’s year-to-date net cash flows generated from operating activities amounted to $135 million compared with cash generated from operating activities of $364 million in the prior-year quarter.Other DevelopmentsIn a separate release, SUPERVALU announced definitive plans to sell eight of its distribution centers for approximately $483 million. Net proceeds after certain adjustments are expected to be close to $445 million. Management stated that the sale and leaseback of seven of these distribution centers will be completed in May, while proceeds for the remaining one are expected to be completed by October. Management stated that the benefits from such sales will be utilized to reduce the company’s debt burden.The company also announced its intentions to sell Shop ‘n Save as well as Shop ‘n Save East. These stores form part of the company’s retail operations. We note that the company’s retail operations have long been grappling with price competition, competitive store openings and intense promotions.Management commented that it remains on track with optimizing its retail operations by exiting businesses, such as that of Shop ‘n Save and Shop ‘n Save East. Other recent developments toward this end includes the company’s plans to sell 21 of its Farm Fresh Food & Pharmacy stores. In this regard, SUPERVALU entered into definite agreements with companies like Harris Teeter, Food Lion and the Mid-Atlantic Division of Kroger (KR  -  Free Report).While SUPERVALU’s retail business remains pressurized, management is impressed with underlying growth of its Wholesale business and is on-track with its strategies to augment the segments’ performance. Incidentally, this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company’s buyout of Associated Grocers in the beginning of the fourth quarter, along with efficient integration of Unified Grocers, underscores the company’s focus on strengthening its Wholesale business.Outlook for 2019For fiscal 2019, management envisions net sales in the band of $15.5-15.7 billion. Identical store sales in the retail segment are expected in the range of flat to slightly positive.SUPERVALU predicts net earnings from continuing operations to range from $55-73 million, while total operating earnings are expected in the band of $147-171 million. Further, the company plans to revise its definition of Adjusted EBITDA in fiscal 2019, to adhere to recent changes in accounting policies as well as to exclude stock-based compensation and certain non-service components. According to the revised definition, adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations for 2019 is expected to range between $375-400 million.Greedy for Consumer Staples Stocks?

216,CAG,"Wall Street is off to a disastrous start in the second quarter. Major bourses tumbled into correction for the second time this year and closed below key technical levels. Elevated trade tensions between the United States and China along with weakness in large-cap tech stocks are cited to be the reasons for the free fall. The prospect of rising interest rates and lofty valuations are expected to trigger another stock market correction in the near term.Given the turmoil, investing in defensive companies seems prudent. Such stocks provide risk-adjusted returns, consistent dividend and steady earnings growth regardless of the state of the equity market.How Did the Benchmarks Perform?The S&P 500 finished 2.2% lower at 2,581.88 on Apr 2, down 10.1% from its record high in Jan 26. The broader index closed below its 200-day moving average for the first time since the U.K.’s vote for Brexit in June 2016. The Dow Jones also closed below the aforesaid technical level, indicating further downtrend in the near future.Unlike the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones, the Nasdaq somehow managed to avoid a correction but it did lose more than 10% from its record high attained in March. This leaves all the three major indices in negative territory for the year, while the CNNMoney’s Fear & Greed Index slipped further into “extreme fear” territory.Global Trade WarSelling in stocks intensified after China decided to impose tariffs on about 130 U.S. goods, including a 25% charge on U.S. pork and 15% on fruits. The world’s second largest economy retaliated against Trump’s plan to slap tariffs on Chinese steel and aluminum shipments.All these have not only weighed on U.S. meat producers as well as industrial stocks, investors panicked as a full-fledged trade war might deal a heavy blow to economies, resulting in widespread unemployment. It may also dent first-quarter corporate earnings results slated to release this month.Big Tech SelloffAdding to the downbeat tone is a sharp selloff in the technology sector. Investors remained concerned about tighter regulations for large tech companies. The sector took a beating following the backlash over Facebook, Inc’s (FB  -  Free Report) handling of user data. Everyone raised questions as to how Cambridge Analytica, which worked on Trump’s election campaign, had gained access to personal data on roughly 50 million Facebook users without their knowledge.Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report), in the meantime, slipped after Trump lashed out at the e-commerce company on its tax policy and subsequent effect on bricks-and-mortar retailers. Another tech major Intel Corporation (INTC  -  Free Report) took a beating after Apple Inc. decided to break away from the chip maker and make its own chips in its Mac computers as early as 2020.Electric car maker Tesla, Inc. (TSLA  -  Free Report) is also sinking after one of its driverless technology vehicles was involved in a fatal crash, while it recalled 123,000 Model S vehicles because of an issue related to a power steering component.Rate Hike FearsAmid all these, Jerome Powell-led Federal Reserve has hiked rates by a quarter-percentage point and projected a steeper path of rate hikes in 2019 and 2020.This hasn’t gone down well with investors as we all know that they had piled up on U.S. stocks with the notion that quantitative easing will help the domestic economy grow at a better rate than emerging economies like China. After all, rate hikes will raise borrowing costs, eventually denting corporate profits and affecting the U.S. economy.How to Prepare for the SetbackAs the markets seem to be plagued with widespread uncertainty, defensive stocks seem to be the safest investment option. Such stocks are generally non-cyclical, or companies whose business performance and sales are not highly correlated with the activities in the larger market. Their products are in constant demand irrespective of market volatility and such names include companies from the utilities and consumer staples sectors.Utilities are deemed defensive stocks as electricity, gas and water are essentials. Food, beverage and tobacco companies are true defensive plays as demand for such staple stocks remains unaltered during market gyrations.5 Solid ChoicesWe have, thus, selected five solid stocks from the aforementioned defensive sectors that boast a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).UtilitiesCenterPoint Energy, Inc. (CNP  -  Free Report) operates as a public utility holding company in the United States. The stock has a Zacks Rank #1 and a dividend yield of 4.2%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings rose 5.4% in the last 60 days. The company is expected to return 13.1% this year, better than the industry’s estimated return of 6.7%.CMS Energy Corporation (CMS  -  Free Report) operates as an energy company primarily in Michigan. It operates through three segments: Electric Utility, Gas Utility, and Enterprises. The stock has a Zacks Rank #2 and a dividend yield of 3.3%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings rose 0.4% in the last 60 days. The company is expected to return 7.4% this year, better than the industry’s estimated return of 6.7%.The AES Corporation (AES  -  Free Report) operates as a diversified power generation and utility company. The stock has a Zacks Rank #2 and a dividend yield of 3%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings rose 2.6% in the last 60 days. The company is expected to return 10.6% this year, better than the industry’s estimated return of 6.7%. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Consumer StaplesKimberly-Clark (KMB  -  Free Report), together with its subsidiaries, manufactures and markets personal care, consumer tissue, and professional products worldwide. The stock has a Zacks Rank #2 and a dividend yield of 3.1%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings rose 0.3% in the last 60 days. The company is expected to return 12.4% this year, better than the industry’s projected return of 9.1%.Conagra Brands, Inc. (CAG  -  Free Report), together with its subsidiaries, operates as a food company in North America. The stock has a Zacks Rank #2 and a dividend yield of 2.6%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings rose 6.3% in the last 60 days. The company is expected to return 17.7% this year, better than the industry’s estimated return of 16.4%.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of All                 Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce """"the world's first trillionaires,"""" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

217,CAG,"Kimberly-Clark Corporation’s (KMB  -  Free Report) savings initiatives have been an aspect of cheer lately. Further, the company is focused on making investments as well as undertaking effective restructuring plans to induce efficiency and enhance market share.However, softness in North American consumer products and the diaper segment as well as rising input costs have been posing concerns for a while. These factors have caused the company’s shares to drop 4.7% in the past six months, while it fared better than the industry's fall of 9%.Nevertheless, lets weigh both the sides and see if the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s growth initiatives can help it uplift the stock. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks hereEnsuring Fuller Pockets With Savings & RestructuringKimberly-Clark is aggressively cutting costs through its Focus on Reducing Costs Everywhere, or FORCE Program. The program has successfully generated higher cost savings each year with record amount of $450 million in 2017.The company projects savings of $400 million in 2018 and more than $1.5 billion over the four-year period from 2018 to 2021. This will be achieved, courtesy of management’s focus on enriching productivity at manufacturing facilities, optimizing design and raw material expenses as well as attaining distribution efficiencies.Further, the company’s adherence toward maximizing savings and inducing operating efficiencies is evident from the 2018 Global Restructuring Program. In fact, the program is considered as one of the largest restructuring initiatives undertaken by the company. It primarily focuses on enhancing underlying profitability for better competition and provides greater flexibility to undertake growth-oriented investments.Delving deeper, we note that the program is expected to simplify Kimberly-Clark’s overhead organization and manufacturing supply chain structures. Notably, management expects cost savings of $50-$70 million from this program in 2018.Further, as part of enhancing efficiency, Kimberly-Clark plans to divest some low-margin businesses, mainly concentrated in the consumer tissue unit. On a combined basis, Kimberly-Clark expects cost savings of more than $2 billion from the FORCE program and 2018 Global Restructuring Program, over the next four years. Focus on Innovation Being a popular name in several consumer product categories, Kimberly-Clark regularly undertakes innovation to sustain its brand positions and market share. Over the near term, the company has a number of innovations lined up for launch in North America, including upgrades on Huggies diapers and baby wipes, Pull-Ups training pants, Depend and Poise in adult care and new Kleenex wet wipes.Hurdles to Be Crossed Kimberly-Clark has been witnessing rising input costs of late. Evidently, increased input costs on account of hiked rates of pulp and other raw materials caused adjusted operating profit to fall 2.7% in the fourth quarter.  In 2018, management expects input cost inflation of about $300-$400 million, primarily in international markets. Additionally, softness in North American consumer products and high competition in the diaper segment have been posing concerns. Final Thoughts  Wrapping up, Kimberly-Clark’s continued emphasis on reducing costs and making growth-oriented investments are expected to offset the aforementioned challenges. Also, management expects tax reforms to favorably impact its bottom-line and cash flows during 2018. Banking on such positives, management envisions adjusted earnings per share to grow roughly 11-16% year over year in 2018.All said, we expect the company’s robust initiatives and a positive outlook to help it overcome persistent challenges in the forthcoming periods.Looking for More?

218,CAG,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put ConAgra Foods, Inc. (CAG  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, ConAgra Foods has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 18.8, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 19.9x. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, ConAgra Foods’ current PE level puts it above its midpoint over the past five years, with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months.However, the stock’s PE compares unfavorably with its industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 18.4. This indicates that the stock is relatively overvalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that ConAgra Foods has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 18.3, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for ConAgra Foods stock in the near term too.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, ConAgra Foods has a P/S ratio of about 1.9. This is a bit lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.3x right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.If anything, CAG is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P/S metric, suggesting some level of undervalued trading—at least compared to historical norms.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, ConAgra Foods currently has a Value Score of B, putting it into the top 40% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes ConAgra Foods a solid choice for value investors.What About the Stock Overall?Though ConAgra Foods might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of B and a Momentum Score of F. This gives CAG a Zacks VGM score — or its overarching fundamental grade — of B. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been upbeat. The current year has seen one estimate go higher in the past sixty days compared to no lower, while the next year estimate has seen two up in the same time period.This has had just a small impact on the consensus estimate though as the current year consensus estimate has inched up by 1% in the past two months, while the next year estimate has increased 1.8%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Conagra Brands Inc. Price and Consensus  Conagra Brands Inc. Price and Consensus | Conagra Brands Inc. QuoteThis positive trend signifies bullish analyst sentiment, and its Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) indicates robust fundamentals and expectations of outperformance in the near term.Bottom LineConAgra Foods is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. However, with a sluggish industry rank (among Bottom 27% of more than 250 industries) it is hard to get too excited about this company overall. In fact, over the past two years, the broader industry has clearly underperformed the market at large, as you can see below:We believe, despite an unsatisfactory past industry performance, a good Zacks rank signal that the stock is likely to benefit from favorable broader factors in the immediate future. Add to this robust value metrics, and we believe that we have a strong value contender in ConAgra Foods.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

219,CAG,"The Hershey Company’s (HSY  -  Free Report) cost-cutting initiatives and productivity investments have been able to mitigate weak top-line performance to a great extent. The company’s latest cost-saving program, Margin for Growth, is expected to boost profits and will be reflected in the to-be-reported quarter. As part of this multi-year program, the company will reduce workforce outside the United States by 15%. The program is intended to improve overall operating margin through supply chain optimization, a streamlined operating model and reduced administrative expenses. Savings from these initiatives will be achieved in 2018 and 2019. These initiatives will enable Hershey to achieve adjusted operating profit margin target of about 22% to 23% by 2019. The company will incur pre-tax charges of $375 million to $425 million and provide benefits between $80 million and $100 million from the layoffs. The savings from Margin for Growth program in 2018 are estimated between $80 million and $90 million, implying an increase of approximately $25 million from the initial projection. The company expects to generate cost-savings at the high end of the $150 million to $175 million target by 2019-end.Apart from cost-saving initiatives, Hershey’s foray in key global markets and increased focus on product innovation bode well.Gaining Traction in International MarketHershey is expanding its business in key global markets to bolster international presence. The company is making measured investments in core markets of Mexico, Brazil and India, where it is witnessing solid marketplace gains. Hershey is steadily activating its five core brands in these markets. Constant-currency net sales in Mexico, Brazil and India increased 12% in the first quarter of 2018 and 11% in 2017.Among the emerging countries, the company’s primary focus is on China. The country has one of the largest consumer bases considering the growing number of middle-class and affluent households. The company plans to add additional manufacturing capacity and resources to boost growth in the region. It started the implementation of the Margin for Growth Program in the second quarter of 2017 to optimize the manufacturing operations to support the China business. Constant-currency net sales were up approximately 1% in the first quarter.Focus on InnovationHershey regularly brings innovations in core brands to cater to consumers’ demand. The company strategically creates a unique and holistic portfolio for every season, which can meet consumers’ seasonal shopping needs. Hershey’s core chocolate brands, Reese's, Hershey's, Kit Kat and Kisses, continue to drive growth. Also, Hershey's Cookie Layer Crunch’s have been performing well. The company expects innovative products to help it achieve long-term net sales growth target of 2% to 4%.High Cost Hurts MarginsThe increased costs related to packaging initiatives are hurting margins. Cost hikes also include unfavorable sales mix and fixed-cost absorption of overhead given lower volumes, unexpected manufacturing variances, higher freight and distribution costs and other supply chain expenses. This is expected to weigh on margins in 2018.In the first quarter of 2018, adjusted gross margin declined 260 basis points due to unfavorable sales mix, higher freight and logistics costs as well as incremental investments in trade and packaging.Hershey Company (The) Price  Hershey Company (The) Price | Hershey Company (The) QuoteZacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderHershey carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the Zacks Consumer Staples sector are United Natural Foods, Inc (UNFI  -  Free Report), Conagra Brands Inc (CAG  -  Free Report) and Lamb Weston Holdings Inc (LW  -  Free Report), each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

220,CAG,"Kimberly-Clark Corporation (KMB  -  Free Report) reported first-quarter 2018 results, with the top and the bottom lines improving year over year. While earnings were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate, sales exceeded the same for the third consecutive period. In fact, strong performance across key market locations prompted management to raise sales view for 2018. Further, the company’s cost-saving efforts are also praiseworthy and significantly aided the company’s performance in the reported quarter.On the flip side, the company’s performance continues to face challenges from rising input costs. This has been marring investors’ optimism in the stock, which has declined 16.4% in the past six months compared with the industry’s fall of 12.8%Quarter in DetailThe quarterly earnings of $1.71 per share came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate and increased almost 9% year over year.Notably, adjusted effective tax rate in the first quarter was 22% compared with 27.5% in the year-ago quarter.Kimberly-Clark’s sales advanced 5% to $4,731 million and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4,599 million. Favorable currency movements benefitted sales by 3%.

Moreover, benefits from the recent tax reforms have led management to undertake plans to improve wage structure and raise earnings view for fiscal 2018.Such aspects have aided shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company to surge 8.2% in the past six months, while the industry declined 5.8% in the same time frame. That said, let’s take a closer look at some of the aforementioned drivers and see what hurdles the company has been facing, lately. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Acquisitions Drive GrowthIn order to expand its spices and seasonings portfolio, McCormick has been strategically increasing its presence through acquisitions. The buyout of the food division of RB Foods in August 2017, is the largest deal by the company till date. With iconic brands like Frank's RedHot Sauce and French's Mustard, RB Foods is likely to continue as an asset for McCormick’s spices portfolio. Prior to this, the company completed significant acquisitions, including Italy-based Enrico Giotti SpA as well as Australia-based Botanical Food Company. Markedly, additional sales from buyouts of RB Foods and Enrico Giotti SpA drove sales by 12% during the first quarter of fiscal 2018, benefiting performances of consumer and flavor solutions units.Notably, a number of companies operating in the food industry such as Campbell Soups (CPB  -  Free Report), Kellog (K  -  Free Report) and Conagra Brands (CAG  -  Free Report) have been resorting to strategic buyouts to widen prospects.  Efforts for Containing CostsMcCormick focuses on saving costs and enhancing productivity through its Comprehensive Continuous Improvement (CCI) program. Cost savings through CCI and streamlining actions amounted to $117 million in fiscal 2017, up from $109 million in fiscal 2016. Notably, cost savings aided in the improvement of the company’s gross and adjusted operating income margins during the first-quarter of fiscal 2018. This marked the company’s ninth consecutive quarter of adjusted operating income margin expansion. The company projects adjusted operating income growth in the range of 23-25% in fiscal 2018, wherein it plans to achieve savings of $100 million.Tax Cuts Aid Improving Wages & OutlookThe recent tax cuts have been a reason for joy to McCormick. Benefits from reduced taxes led management to rewarded employees with plans to provide bonuses and increase wage rates. Further, advantages from tax cuts led management to raise earnings outlook for fiscal 2018. Earnings are expected in the range of $4.85-$4.95, reflecting growth from the previous range of $4.80-$4.90. The raised outlook also takes into consideration the projected positive impact of nearly one percentage point from currency fluctuations.Can Savings Offset Cost Woes?McCormick has been concerned about escalating raw material costs along with increased brand marketing and freight expenses. Moreover, in fiscal 2018, the company expects material costs to escalate in low-single digits. McCormick is also increasing brand marketing expenses to drive sales.Nevertheless, we expect the aforementioned cost-related hurdles to be adequately cushioned by the company’s robust CCI program and efficient pricing strategies. Apart from these, management expects to continue reaping benefits from its acquisitions, product launches, expanded distribution network and brand marketing. With such positives, McCormick has plenty of reasons to stay encouraged and further raise investors’ optimism in the stock.Breaking News: Cryptocurrencies Now Bigger than VisaThe total market cap of all cryptos recently surpassed $700 billion – more than a 3,800% increase in the previous 12 months. They’re now bigger than Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and even Visa!

229,CAG,"China is mulling over to reduce import duties on a wide range of consumer products, effective as early as Jul 1. Although the exact composition of the cuts has not been finalized yet and is still subject to approval by the State Council, the cuts are expected to be applied on around 200 items including food, medicine, health products and cosmetics.The move came on the heels of Beijing’s goal of boosting consumption in the world’s second-biggest economy that could revive the slowdown. Additionally, the move is a step forward to defuse tensions with the Trump administration over the trade imbalance and in is line with China’s pledge to buy more U.S. goods to substantially reduce America's massive trade deficit.In fact, this would mark the second import duty reduction in U.S.-China trade talks to avert a war. China this week also slashed import tariffs for automobiles and car parts effective Jul 1. The import duties have been reduced from 25% to 15% for vehicles and from 10% to 6% for auto parts including bumpers, doors and seat belts.The tariff reduction on consumer goods would open up doors for companies to expand and deepen their presence in China. It would also allow foreign companies to earn more profits by selling more consumer goods in the world's second biggest economy with lower taxes.This is the second time in six months that China has lowered import tariffs on consumer goods. In December, Beijing cut duties on almost 200 consumer products including food, health supplements, pharmaceuticals, garments, and recreational goods to 7.7% on average from 17.3%. Among the categories that saw exceptional cuts were milk powder and diapers, whose taxes have been slashed to zero percent from 20% and 7.5%, respectively. Import duties on certain cosmetics were halved to 5% at that time.Given the potential of additional tax cuts on consumer goods, the consumer staples sector seems a promising bet. As such, we have highlighted five stocks from the in-focus industries in the sector that poses strong fundamentals with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and double-digit estimated growth for this year.Inter Parfums Inc.

230,CAG,"Pinnacle Foods Inc. (PF  -  Free Report) has been riding on sustained market share growth. This renowned food manufacturer and distributor boasts a sturdy brand portfolio, buoyed by acquisitions and innovation. Indeed, these factors have been raising investors’ optimism, evident from the stock’s 14% rally in the past three months, against the industry’s decline of 8.3% in the same time frame. On the flip side, the company struggles with input cost inflation and a sluggish Specialty segment. That said, let’s take a closer look at the factors impacting this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company.Strong Market Share & Other Strategic MovesPinnacle Foods has long been gaining from in-market advancements. In fact, during first-quarter 2018, the company’s retail consumption expanded 3.5% along with market share growth of 0.4 points. This marked the company’s 16th consecutive period of growth in composite market share. The sturdy performance reflects the company’s solid customer reach, whose products can be found in more than 85% U.S. households. Further, innovations have contributed toward building a sturdy portfolio. Noteworthy innovations in the past, include new varieties of the Duncan Hines Decadent, Duncan Hines Perfect Size baking kits, Birds Eye product lines and Vlasic purely pickles. For 2018, management plans to roll out products under the Birds Eye brand and will also be expanding the Hungry-Man Handful line, Duncan Hines line, gardein and Evol brands.In addition, Pinnacle Foods brand augmenting efforts include undertaking acquisitions that improve distribution network and expand customer base. The buyout of Boulder Brands, completed in January 2016, provided Pinnacle Foods a growth platform for refrigerated foods and added several products, complementary foodservice, private label and Canadian businesses. In 2017, the company gained synergies of $16 million from the Boulder acquisition. Further, management expects to benefit from the residual synergies associated with this acquisition. In December 2017, the company acquired Beaver Dam food facility to expand Birds Eye line. Other than this, Pinnacle Foods acquired the Duncan Hines manufacturing business and Garden Protein in 2014 and also purchased the Wish-Bone salad dressings business in 2013.Along with endeavors to constantly expand brand portfolio, Pinnacle Foods focuses on strengthening marketing capabilities. In this respect, the company recently announced its partnership with VaynerMedia.Further, the company has an operational excellence program in place, which is designed to generate annual productivity savings in the supply chain. On account of such efforts combined with acquisition synergies and benefits from the network optimization, the company expects productivity for 2018 in the range of 4-4.5% of cost of products sold. Productivity in the second half of 2018 is expected to be higher. Lingering ConcernsPinnacle Foods has been battling increased costs, primarily stemming from logistics for quite some time. During first-quarter 2018, the company’s adjusted gross margin contracted 130 basis points (bps) on account of increased inflation from transportation costs as well as costs related to innovation outsourcing. Further, management expects input cost inflation for 2018 in the range of 3.8-4.2%.Apart from this, a sluggish Specialty segment also weighs on Pinnacle Foods’ performance. The company has been witnessing weaknesses in this unit since six consecutive quarters. In the first quarter, sales in the segment tumbled 15% to $75.2 million due to negative impacts of the AJ exit and lower volume/mix.Final ThoughtsDespite the aforementioned headwinds, Pinnacle Foods undoubtedly has several reasons to rejoice, courtesy of well-chalked strategic efforts to maintain a strong market position. Well, these factors have also encouraged management to provide an impressive earnings view for 2018.Looking for More?

231,CAG,"Church & Dwight Co., Inc. (CHD  -  Free Report) is worth a look, given its robust international consumer business and impressive organic sales trend among other growth drivers. These factors, which helped the company retain its solid earnings surprise trend in first-quarter 2018, are expected to fuel growth further at the Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company.While Church & Dwight has gained 4% in the past six months, it has fared much better than the industry that has tumbled 8.7%. So, let’s delve deep into the factors that have been propelling Church & Dwight.International Consumer Unit StrengthChurch & Dwight has long been gaining from strength at its International Consumer unit. In first-quarter 2018, organic sales in the international segment jumped 6.8%, courtesy of higher volumes, and improved pricing and mix.Further, overall international sales surged 26.3%, receiving considerable impetus from OXICLEAN in the export business; STERIMAR, ARM & HAMMER toothpaste and OXICLEAN in Mexico; and FEMFRESH and BATISTE in Australia. Further, the company is opening new offices in order to support increase in export business and expects this business to remain strong. Also, it is making considerable investments in Southeast Asia and China, which is likely to be a major growth driver in the future.Impressive Organic Sales TrendChurch & Dwight has been witnessing organic sales growth for quite some time now, backed by its solid focus on product innovations. Evidently, organic sales grew 3.8% in the first quarter of 2018. Further, organic sales jumped 2.3%, 1.8%, 3.2% and 3.4% in first, second, third and fourth-quarter 2017, respectively. In the first quarter, organic sales growth was driven by a 4.2% rise in global consumer products’ growth, which in turn was fueled by higher volumes. In 2018, management expects organic sales to grow more than 3%.Buyouts Remain a Major Growth DriverThe company, which started with only one brand, i.e. ARM & HAMMER, has acquired a number of premium high-margin brands over time. These businesses have been boosting the company’s revenues, which are expected to reach $4 billion in 2018 from $1.5 billion in 2004. In this regard, Church & Dwight recently acquired Waterpik, which contributed significantly to its sales in the first quarter. Management expects sales from Waterpik to increase in high single digits in 2018. The company's other acquisitions include Agro BioSciences in May and VIVISCAL business in January 2017. Prior to that, the acquisitions of ANUSOL and RECTINOL brands from Johnson & Johnson in December 2016 helped the company boost its business internationally.A Glimpse of Q1 & Looking AheadThe aforementioned factors, along with Church & Dwight’s strong brand portfolio and focus on innovations, helped it to post solid first-quarter 2018 results. Both the top and bottom line grew year over year and topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate, marking the company’s sixth and third consecutive quarter of positive earnings and sales surprise, respectively. Moving ahead, Church & Dwight’s stable portfolio of value and premium products, launch of new and innovative products, and aggressive productivity programs are expected to keep driving its performance.Management expects solid volume growth and improved market share to drive 2018 results. Consequently, the company raised its sales outlook and now expects 2018 reported sales to grow about 9%. Benefits from tax reforms are still expected to boost bottom-line growth. The company’s estimated earnings per share of $2.24-$2.28 reflect 16-18% growth in 2018.Looking for More?

232,CAG,"Sysco Corporation (SYY  -  Free Report) has been the market’s darling of late, courtesy of numerous growth initiatives. With focus on acquisitions being one of the key endeavors, the stock has rallied 20.9% in a year, faring way better than the industry that tumbled 14.3% in the same time frame. Rolling on these lines, the company recently concluded the previously announced buyout of Kent Frozen Foods – following which its shares have gained 4.9%.Given this bullish run over just two trading sessions, we remain quite encouraged about the prospects from this take over, among the other strategies driving this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company. What Kent Frozen Acquisition Means for Sysco?Sysco brought U.K.-based Kent Frozen Foods under its wings on Apr 3, which will form part of the company’s international operations, thereby being an addition to its existing Brakes, Fresh Direct and M&J Seafood businesses. Following the approval of the Competition and Markets Authority, the deal was concluded in an all-cash basis.Although Kent Frozen Foods will continue to function as a separate entity, it is set to gain from Sysco’s superior hold and brand image in the foodservice market. Further, the deal will enable Kent to establish closer ties with other businesses of Sysco in the U.K. and European regions. While Sysco’s U.S. Foodservice operations has long been a growth driver for the company, this buyout is likely to fuel its International segment.Well, sales at the International Foodservice segment increased 9.3% to roughly $2,869 million in the last reported quarter. Adjusted operating income tanked 28.8% to $79 million. While results in Canada gained strength from surge in local cases and efficient expense management, the company’s European business remained difficult. This stemmed from the amendment from the calendar year to fiscal, which weighed on costs and gross profit. Also, the company incurred higher costs in Europe due to constant investments in transformation endeavors. However, these initiatives poise the company well for the long term.Focus on Buyouts: A Major Key to Sysco’s SuccessNotably, acquisitions have always been profitable and aided in augmenting Sysco’s market share and distribution network, thereby boosting long-term growth prospects. Notably, the company expects to achieve 0.5-1% sales growth through acquisitions, in the long run. In fact, earlier this year, the company acquired Doerle Food Services (a Louisiana-based food service distributor) to widen its U.S. distribution network. This buyout is expected to Strengthen Sysco’s core business and maximize customers’ value.Looking back, in 2017, Sysco acquired HFM FoodService and the remaining 50% stake in Mayca Distribuidores to enhance its U.S. and international businesses, respectively. Apart from that, Sysco’s acquisition of London-based Brakes Group in 2016 has been benefiting the company significantly and is expected to generate sales of approximately $55 billion annually.That said, we expect the addition of Kent Frozen Foods to add yet another leaf to Sysco’s growth story, by driving the performance of its international segment.Looking for More Promising Bets?

233,CAG,"SUPERVALU INC.’s (SVU  -  Free Report) retail segment performance has long been eclipsed by adverse industry conditions, leading to store closures and decline in identical store sales. Moreover, in an effort to offload underperforming stores from the retail segment, the company recently announced selling off several of its Farm Fresh stores. That said, the company has lately been focused on strengthening its wholesale business and has undertaken several initiatives to this end.Retail Segment Crumbling DownWhile consumer inclination toward online shopping has been revolutionizing the e-commerce realm, the changing retail landscape has hit traditional stores hard. Additionally, in an effort to attract more shoppers to the stores, retailers have been engaging in intense promotional activities and price wars, further aggravating the competitive scenario and making survival a remote possibility for the weak.Notably, retail stores of SUPERVALU have also fallen victim to such downturns and have been gravely underperforming, causing the company to resort to store closures. Owing to these hurdles, the company’s identical store sales in the retail segment have declined over the past 11 quarters. In third-quarter fiscal 2018, identical store sales dropped 3.5%, which, along with store closures, dragged down net sales at the Retail unit by 4.1%. Also, the segment incurred adjusted operating loss of $3 million, while retail gross margin also contracted due to soft sales and high promotions. Unfortunately, management expects the retail segment to continue bearing the brunt of these headwinds in fiscal 2018 as well.Continuing with the company’s endeavors to cut down retail stores, SUPERVALU has entered into definitive agreements with Mid-Atlantic Division of Kroger (KR  -  Free Report); Harris Teeter and Food Lion to sell 21 of its Farm Fresh Food & Pharmacy stores, in a transaction worth nearly $43 million. The deal is expected to close in May 2018, subject to certain closing conditions. Looking back, during fiscal 2016, the company sold nearly 1,350 Save-A-Lot stores. The company is expected to undertake more Farm Fresh store closures in the near future, which is likely to pull down the retail segment’s performance even further.Moreover, such challenges have taken a toll on investors’ sentiments upon the stock. Shares of this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company have plunged 36.9% in the past year, considerably wider than the industry’s decline of 13.2%.  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Focus on Wholesale BusinessWhile on one side SUPERVALU has been shuttering its retail stores, the company has also been undertaking endeavors to fortify its foothold in the wholesale arena. This move is backed by the motive of transforming the company’s business into a wholesale operational model. Thus, it is on track to develop wholesale operations, primarily through acquisitions. In this regard, the company concluded the buyout of Associated Grocers of Florida in the beginning of the fourth-quarter fiscal 2018, while it acquired Unified Grocers in June 2017. Notably, Unified Grocers contributed sales worth about $860 million to SUPERVALU’s Wholesale business during the fiscal third quarter and the company remains on track to generate targeted synergies from this buyout. Notably, a number of companies operating in the food industry, such as Campbell Soups (CPB  -  Free Report) and Conagra Brands (CAG  -  Free Report), have been resorting to strategic buyouts and widening their growth prospects.  Apart from this, the company also has supply agreements with retailers like America’s Food Basket, which is expected to fuel sales growth at this segment. Also, management remains committed toward enhancing operating efficiency, reducing costs and optimizing distribution channels, information technology and logistics, which will lift margins.Backed by such dedicated growth efforts, sales from this segment grew 52% year over year to $2,888 million in the fiscal third quarter, representing roughly 73% of the company’s total revenues. All said, the company remains dedicated toward making investments in its Wholesale business to boost future growth.Wrapping it UpBy exiting from Farm Fresh and other retail banners, SUPERVALU has been able to allocate more resources toward the strategic expansion of its wholesale business. Given the fact that the retail segment has been going down in shambles, thanks to industry-wide headwinds, the company’s move to strengthen its wholesale business seems quite rational and is expected to uplift its performance in the forthcoming periods.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

234,CAG,"Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and Conagra Brands Inc. (CAG  -  Free Report) may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Conagra is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for CAG in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at 58 cents per share for CAG, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of 55 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for CAG, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +6.06% heading into earnings season.Conagra Brands Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Conagra Brands Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Conagra Brands Inc. QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market.

235,CAG,"TreeHouse Foods, Inc. (THS  -  Free Report) has seen its shares surge 22.1% in the past three months, against the industry’s drop of 8.5%.  In fact, despite witnessing a decline in revenues and earnings in first-quarter 2018, the company’s shares have rallied about 17% since the quarterly outcome. Thus, let’s delve deeper into what’s been driving investors’ optimism and see if it can sustain.  TreeHouse 2020 Plan: A Major DriverTreeHouse Foods is on track with its TreeHouse 2020 strategic plan that was announced in second-quarter 2017.

The company expects to invest these savings in market-differentiated capacities to cater to consumers’ ever-changing demands. Also, the company remains on track to close certain facilities, shut at least 15 production lines and complete the rollout of the TreeHouse Management Operating System in 2018. It looks like the focus on TreeHouse 2020 and expected annual savings of about $55 million from the company’s Structure to Win plan has raised investors’ confidence in TreeHouse Foods’ stock.Focus on Buyouts Bodes WellTreeHouse Foods has always been focused on expanding its product offerings through acquisitions. In February 2016, the company acquired Private Brands Business from ConAgra Foods for $2.7 billion. The addition of Private Brands has added to the revenues and helped the company to lower debt. The company’s other acquisitions include Flagstone Foods, PFF Capital Group, Inc. (“Protenergy”), Cains Foods, L.P., Associated Brands, and Naturally Fresh, Inc. The company expects to utilize its scale, management depth, integration expertise and access to capital to pursue both small and large acquisitions in the future.Healthy and Organic Food Offerings Draw CustomersThe company focuses on organic foods, as consumers appear to be more interested in foods described as “better for you,” which include fresh or freshly prepared foods, and natural, organic, or specialty foods. Moreover, Treehouse Foods has witnessed positive comparable store sales growth trends in food away from home outlets, which mainly focuses on clean ingredients and labels, resulting in higher demand for “natural” or organic type products. Notably, premium, better for you, natural and organic offerings now form more than 21% of the company’s sales. In fact, we note that the restaurants and retailers are increasing the use of cage-free eggs, as they are healthy. The company expects sustained growth in these areas and continues to focus on consumer’s needs by developing new formulations, packaging, and sizes.Can Growth Sustain Amid Cost Hurdles?TreeHouse Foods’ growth drivers helped it post earnings and sales beat for the second time in a row, in first-quarter 2018. However, results fell year over year. While earnings were hurt by increased freight and commodity costs and soft sales, sales bore the brunt of divestiture of SIF (Canned Soup and Infant Feeding) business. Well, TreeHouse foods has been posting lower DOI margin for the past three quarters, owing to higher commodity and freight costs. During the first quarter, division DOI margin contracted 270 bps year over year to 8.9%, due to volume/mix impacts, unfavorable pricing, with respect to the rising commodity expenses, escalated freight charges and impact from SKU rationalization. Management expects increased freight and commodity costs to remain headwinds for some time now.Nevertheless, management remains encouraged about exploiting the opportunities in the significant private label space. Also, the company remains focused on curtailing costs and aligning capacities with consumer needs efficiently. We expect such endeavors to continue fueling growth and help retain investors’ confidence in this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company.Looking for More Promising Stocks?

236,CAG,"Conagra Brands, Inc. (CAG  -  Free Report) will assure a promising investment move if the stock is added to your portfolio at the moment. Over the last six months, Conagra’s shares have yielded a return of 6.5%, against 7.5% loss recorded by its industry. Notably, the attractiveness of this stock as a current investment choice is further accentuated by its favorable VGM Score of B.Why Grab the Stock?Value-over-Volume Strategy: Conagra is currently following a unique value-over-volume strategy, through which it is prioritizing over price/mix metric and margins, instead of volumes. In sync with this, the company ensures that its robust volume performance is driven by stronger innovation as well as new merchandizing, distribution, and consumer trail-related investments; instead of price discounts.Top-Line Prospects: Sturdy demand for premium brands like Healthy Choice, Marie Callender, Slim Jim, Duke's, Bigs and Frontera is expected to boost Conagra’s revenues in the quarters ahead.Moreover, new investments planned to strengthen its frozen business and brand renovation initiatives undertaken to improve snacks business would likely aid in improving Conagra’s top-line results in the upcoming quarters.The company also believes that favorable foreign currency translation impact will drive its near-term revenue growth.   The company’s projected sales growth for fiscal 2019 (ending May 2019) is currently pegged at 1.5%.Inorganic Pose: Conagra intends to boost its competency by reshaping its portfolio through meaningful inorganic moves. In sync with this, the company tries to acquire high-margin generating businesses and divest the less-profitable ones. For instance, the strategic acquisition of Angie's Artisan Treats, LLC (completed in October 2017) and Sandwich Bros. (completed in February 2018) is likely continue boosting revenues and profitability in the quarters ahead. On the other hand, Del Monte’s spin-off will likely be accomplished by the end of May this year.Improving Profitability: Conagra reported better-than-expected earnings in fiscal third quarter on the back of lower corporate tax rate (on account of new Tax Cuts and Jobs Act implementation in December 2017), reduced interest expenses, rise in Ardent Mills joint venture profitability and share buyback moves.Going forward, the company intends to improve its bottom-line performance by exiting from low-margin businesses, driving robust top-line performance, improving share repurchase activity and lowering tax rates.Notably, Conagra has lifted its earnings view for fiscal 2018 to $2.03-$2.05 per share range from the prior outlook of $1.84-$1.89 per share.Shareholders’ Interest: Conagra is also highly committed toward its shareholders and tries to provide adequate returns to them through dividends and share buyback offers. In fiscal third-quarter 2018, the company repurchased roughly 8 million of common stock for $280 million.Additionally, Conagra is on track with its aim to buyback $1.1 billion shares in full-year fiscal 2018 (Ending May 2018).Upward Estimate Revisions: Over the past 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Conagra moved 6.3% upward to $2.03 and 7.6% to $2.27 for fiscal 2018 and 2019, respectively.The positive earnings estimate revision indicates upbeat sentiments and substantiates the Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for this stock.The stock’s projected earnings per share (EPS) growth rate for fiscal 2018 and 2019 is pegged at 16.7% and 11.7%, respectively.Other Stocks to ConsiderOther top-ranked stocks in the same space are listed below:Medifast, Inc.

237,CAG,"Companhia Brasileira de Distribuicao (CBD  -  Free Report) has seen its shares rally 6.2% over the past month against the industry’s fall of 2.6%. The company, which recently reported solid first-quarter 2018 results, has been gaining from continued strength at Assai among other factors. Let’s see if these factors can keep propelling the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock that continues to battle food deflation.What’s Driving Companhia Brasileira?The company remains focused on its strategy for 2018-2020 which aims at delivering solid food segment performance. The company plans to achieve this by utilizing its multi-network and multi-format existence to offer consumers the innovative services and products. Apart from this, the company also remains on track with digital transformation, as highlighted by the launch of My Discount platform at Multivarejo, which garnered considerable success over the last seven months.Management stated that focus on digital development will remain a major priority in 2018, given consumers’ evolving shopping patterns. Apart from this, the company’s core growth plans involve continued organic expansion and stores optimization along with enhancing retail format offerings and extending offerings of financial services (particularly at Assai). Moreover, the company targets generating synergies of more than $85 million from Latin America.Also, Companhia Brasileira is gearing up to expand stores and consequently its market share. The company has been putting greater emphasis on renovating Extra banners, as it has been performing better than the non-renovated stores over the last three years. Store modernizations were carried out at all banners in the Food segment, most intensively at Extra. These renovations include not only the layout but also new assortments and improvements in customer service, which will in turn drive higher sales. The company operated 127 Assai stores by the end of the first quarter of 2018.Focus on such growth efforts drove Companhia Brasileira’s performance in first-quarter 2018, wherein Assai continued to stand out. During the quarter, overall net income from continuing operations surged 40.1% (in local currency) year over year. Increased sales and higher adjusted EBITDA led to the upside. Further, net revenues increased 7.5% year over year in local currency. Also, EBITDA margin expanded 30 bps, courtesy of higher margins at both segments. At Multivarejo, the margin expansion was backed by reduced selling costs and productivity gains while Assai’s margins gained from favorable taxation and store expansion efforts.Hurdles to be Offset?However, Companhia Brasileira continues to battle food deflation. Evidently, food deflation had a negative impact on Assai’s gross margin in the first quarter of 2018 while it also led to an increase in Assai’s SG&A expenses. Also, food deflation dampened gross sales at Multivarejo. Prior to this, deflation was a major drag on Companhia Brasileira’s fourth-quarter results, wherein net income declined 18.4% year over year — hit by contraction in EBITDA margin largely stemming from acute food price deflation. Unfortunately, management had earlier stated that it expects food deflation to persist in 2018 which remains a threat.Nonetheless, Companhia Brasileira regained its leading position in the Brazilian food space during the last reported quarter, courtesy of its strategic plan to focus on the cash-and-carry segment. Going forward, the company remains confident of strengthening this position, courtesy of continued strength in Assai and expected enhancements at Multivarejo.Looking for More Promising Stocks?

238,CAG,"The J. M. Smucker Company’s (SJM  -  Free Report) top line has been gaining from improved performance of its brands. In fact, growth in several key brands boosted the company’s top-line performance during second-quarter fiscal 2018. Further, the company is on track with product innovation efforts. It has also been augmenting offerings through acquisitions and partnerships.Driven by such factors, shares of the company have gained 8.7% in the past three months compared with the industry’s rally of 2.5%. However, the company has been struggling with the performance of its coffee segment, due to price volatility. Let’s analyze all aspects and see if Smucker’s strategic efforts can help offset the hurdles and drive growth.Smucker’s Brand Strengthening Efforts Bode WellSmucker boasts a strong brand portfolio, which include high-quality products that are moderately priced. We note that the Jif, Smucker's, Nature's Recipe and Uncrustable brands have been performing favorably over the past few quarters. Incidentally, the company has been constructing a frozen sandwich plant in Colorado to enhance the capacity of Uncrustable brand. The growing popularity of certain brands has encouraged the company to undertake innovations. Recent launches include Natural Balance high-protein dog food offerings and Dunkin' Donuts Cold Brew Coffee. Notably, these launches contributed significantly toward sales growth during the second quarter. Additionally, the company plans to introduce Milk-Bone Puffs dog treats and Dunkin' Donuts coffee canisters by the end of fiscal 2018.Additionally, Smucker’s rich brands line-up gains from key partnerships and acquisitions. The company’s agreement with Keurig Green Mountain Inc. and Dunkin’ Brands Group Inc. to manufacture and sell the K-Cup category of products has been yielding positive results since fiscal 2016. Further, the company’s focus on achieving expansion via acquisitions is evident from its planned buyout of Wesson oil brand from Conagra Brands. The deal is currently subject to regulatory approval.Barriers in Smucker’s WaySmucker has been struggling with volatility in the prices of green coffee. Coffee prices are vulnerable to adverse weather conditions, pest infestation, political decisions as well as worldwide supply and demand conditions. Notably, green coffee prices have been rising steadily for some time, thereby denting profits in the coffee segment.Further, management expects a rise in freight costs, stemming from industry-wide headwinds to hurt performance in the forthcoming periods. Accordingly, the company lowered the high end of its fiscal 2018 earnings guidance in the last reported quarter.Final ThoughtsWe expect this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s concentration on strengthening core brands to drive the top line and offset the aforementioned hurdles. We are also encouraged with the company’s savings-boosting initiatives, which are likely to fuel investments and enhance performance in the long term. Do Consumer Staples Stocks Grab Your Attention?

239,CAG,"SUPERVALU INC. (SVU  -  Free Report) recently concluded the acquisition of Associated Grocers, for approximately $193 million. This Florida-based company is likely to be a profitable inclusion to SUPERVALU’s wholesale business, given its strong customer and retailer base as well as presence in key international regions.Notably, shares of SUPERVALU rose 3.6% following the announcement, during the after market trading session on Dec 8. So let’s see how Associated Grocers is expected to help SUPERVALU’s business and other factors impacting the company’s performance.  Expanding Wholesale Business SpectrumSUPERVALU derives a major portion of revenues from the wholesale business and has been consistently expanding operations, primarily through acquisitions. In fact, the company’s takeover of Unified Grocers in June drove wholesale segment sales by 58% year over year in second quarter fiscal 2018.Management believes that the wholesale segment offers significant growth prospects owing to rapidly changing consumer needs. The inclusion of Associated Grocers is expected to further enable the company reap benefits from the opportunities offered by this segment.Further, the acquisition of Associated Grocers and Unified Grocers are expected to augment the company’s offering in the specialty and organic food categories. Notably, organic food products are becoming popular owing to rising health consciousness amongst consumers. Thus, the company has been evaluating prospects in the organic foods arena and has partnered with wholesale merchants to explore opportunities in this category.Competition & Cost Inflation Weighs On StockAlthough SUPERVALU has been progressing steadily with the wholesale segment, the company’s retail category is challenged with price competition, competitive store openings and tough market conditions. As a result, the company has resorted to several store closures in the retail segment.Further, the company has been facing stiff competition from grocery rivals in terms of innovative food offerings and related services. On account of these headwinds, shares of the company have lost 31.7% over the past three months, compared with the industry’s decline of 5.2%.Can Growth Efforts Boost Performance?Nevertheless, we expect SUPERVALU’s wholesale segment growth strategies such as the acquisition of Associated Grocers to offset softness in the retail arena. Also, to revive the retail segment’s performance, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company is rebranding most of its banners, launching new brands and expanding offerings in the Wild Harvest line.Do Consumer Staples Stocks Grab Your Attention?

The rise in sales can primarily be attributable to mid- to high single-digit increase in the United Kingdom and Rest of World, including the Canada and Europe operating segments.

245,CAG,"Colgate-Palmolive Company (CL  -  Free Report) has been gaining on the recent progress of its savings program. Moreover, the company remains well poised with innovation, brand building and productivity maximization initiatives. However, strained margins remain a threat.Let’s analyze the pros and cons of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock.Robust Savings Plan: A Key ToolColgate remains optimistic about its Global Growth and Efficiency Program as well as Funding the Growth undertakings, which are delivering impressive results. Also, the company has extended its Global Growth and Efficiency Program through Dec 31, 2019. This will enable the company to take advantage of the incremental opportunities in the process of streamlining operations. Additionally, it expects after-tax savings from the program to increase to $500-$575 million compared with $425-$475 million projected earlier.In fact, Colgate’s four-year Global Growth and Efficiency Program will help the company to improve gross and operating profit and enhance its market share position worldwide. By funding the growth initiative, the company intends to open new environmentally sustainable distribution centers to offer better service to its customers, besides reducing fuel and transportation costs. The aforementioned endeavors are expected to contribute significantly toward the improvement of gross and operating margins over the long term.Innovation Aids GrowthColgate has been undertaking innovation and in-store implementation, as a key component of its growth strategies, over many years. This has enabled the company to capture the market share across all regions and categories. On the innovation front, it is coming up with Naturals, an innovation to counter local toothpaste brands, particularly in Asia and Eurasia. Colgate has managed to tailor the Naturals offerings in each of its major markets as well.Decent Earnings Trend & Bullish OutlookColgate has delivered in-line earnings for the third consecutive quarter in fourth-quarter 2017. In fact, this marked the company’s fifth in-line earnings in the last six quarters. Results can be attributed to solid sales and significant market share gains. Going forward, the company remains on track with the brand building and productivity maximization initiatives.Following the results, Colgate provided a bullish outlook for 2018. The company now anticipates net sales to increase in the mid-single-digit range and organic sales growth of low to mid-single digit. Also, including benefits from the tax reform, GAAP earnings are envisioned to improve in the double-digits range while adjusted earnings are anticipated to be up nearly 10%.Bottom LineWhile all seems well with Colgate, it is currently plagued with strained margins for the past few quarters. In fourth-quarter 2017, the company faced increased raw material and packaging costs as well as higher advertising expenses, thus creating pressure on margins.Looking ahead, the company expects adjusted gross margin to expand 50-70 bps in 2018. However, it also expects to incur higher advertising expenses, which is likely to weigh upon operating margins. In addition, Colgate anticipates the challenging backdrop to persist due to uncertain global markets and slowing category growth worldwide.Consequently, shares of Colgate have lost 2.4% in the past three months, outperforming the industry’s decline of 6.8%.Nevertheless, Colgate’s robust savings program, innovations, brand building and productivity maximization initiatives are likely to drive long-term growth.Looking for More Promising Bets?

Moreover, the top line cruised ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,389 million.The company’s gross profit increased 5.2% to $367.2 million though the gross margin contracted 38 bps to 14.9% on account of an unfavorable shift in consumer mix.

As a percentage of sales, operating expenses decreased 28 bps to 12.7%, mainly thanks to fixed cost leverage on higher sales.

Thus, United Natural generated negative free cash flow of $77.3 million. The company stated that its first quarter usually records the lowest free cash flow, owing to raised inventories for the holiday season demand — which was exceptionally high this time.Fiscal 2018 GuidanceManagement remains impressed with an impressive start to the fiscal, with broad-based improvement across all important sales networks in the first quarter. Further, it believes that the company remains well placed for growth, given consumers’ solid demand for United Natural’s better-for-you food products and services; across all channels including retails stores; food service; e-commerce and international.Notably, United Natural Foods’ impressive earnings history and focus on strategic endeavors has helped this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock surge 26% in the past six months, as against the industry’s fall of 3.9%. Additionally, the company stated that it continued to witness record sales and shipping unit volumes in the second quarter. However, inbound fill rates related to the unexpected demand remains a hurdle, which also weighed on sales in the first quarter. Nonetheless, United Nations is focused on enhancing its supply chain networks to better align supplies with demand. All said, management raised its previously issued sales and earnings view for fiscal 2018.United Natural now expects net sales for fiscal 2018 to be in the range of $9.84-$10.0 billion, in comparison with the previously guided range of $9.63-$9.81 billion.

247,CAG,"Pinnacle Foods Inc (PF  -  Free Report) has been steadily expanding its portfolio through acquisitions and innovations. Also, the company has been gaining from its operational efficiency initiatives that have been boosting savings. However, underlying weaknesses in the Specialty segment and changing consumer preferences have been denting the company’s top line.Let’s delve deeper into these factors and see if Pinnacle Foods’ growth drivers can help offset the hurdles.Portfolio Expansion & Savings Aid GrowthAcquisitions have been an important growth driver for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company. Along with portfolio expansion, acquisitions have been driving Pinnacle Foods’ distribution network, customer base and long-term growth. We note that the Boulder Brands buyout in 2016, provided the company new prospects in refrigerated foods business. The benefits from this acquisition are expected to enhance procurement, manufacturing and logistics operations. Further, the company expects to achieve synergies worth more than $15 million in 2017 and projects incremental synergies of $4-6 million in 2018 from Boulder Brands.  Other acquisitions which have driven Pinnacle Foods’ business in the past include Duncan Hines, Garden Protein and Wish-Bone. Further, the company plans to expand its brands line-up through innovations. In this regard, the company launched Hungry-Man handfuls during the third quarter of 2017, which is a four-line item of hand-held pocket meals. Other noteworthy launches include the introductions of Perfect Size for One, Vlasic purely pickles and Birds Eye product lines.Moving ahead, Pinnacle Foods remains on track with operational excellence program, aimed at generating productivity savings in supply chain. Owing to such efforts, the company expects gross margin to improve 300-400 basis points by 2019. Pinnacle Foods is also pursuing other initiatives to boost profits including low-margin SKU rationalization and increasing the effectiveness of trade promotional spending. Courtesy of dedicated business expansions and efficiency boosting initiatives, Pinnacle Foods has been witnessing year-over-year growth in earnings since 2014. This also helped the company’s shares gain 13.4% in the past year, as against the industry’s decline of 2.3%.Headwinds Impacting PerformancePinnacle Foods’ Specialty segment has been reporting sluggish performance since the past five quarters. The segment’s performance was hurt by the exit of low-margin Aunt Jemima frozen breakfast products and lower net price realization in the third quarter. Also, the exit of the gardein private label business and soft food service sales hampered underlying sales, alongside weighing upon the segment margin.On account of these obstacles, along with consumer’s shift toward healthy and natural food products, the company’s sales have lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimates in five out of the trailing seven quarters.Final ThoughtsNevertheless, management expects earnings to improve 19% in 2017, on the back of steady growth in market share stemming from well- performing brands. Further, management remains committed toward network optimization and operational excellence programs and continues to expect benefits from acquisitions. We expect such upsides to offset the weakness in the Specialty segment and sustain growth.Do Consumer Staples Stocks Grab Your Attention?

248,CAG,"Kimberly-Clark Corporation’s (KMB  -  Free Report) performance has been impressive of late, owing to stringent cost-saving and restructuring initiatives. Additionally, this professional and personal care products company has been steadily expanding its portfolio through innovations. However, adverse North American market conditions and stiff competition in the diaper segment are headwinds.Nevertheless, Kimberly-Clark’s growth efforts have helped shares gain 2.3% in the past three months against the industry’’s decline of 6.6%.Let’s delve into the factors that have been impacting this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s performance.Cost-Savings & Restructuring Initiatives Bode WellKimberly-Clark has been cutting costs through Focus on Reducing Costs (FORCE) program.

Also, the company has been struggling with increased competitive activity in diaper segment. The diaper category faces challenges due to lower birth rates in South Korea and in the United States. These factors have dented the company’s top-line growth for a while.Final ThoughtsWe expect Kimberly-Clark’s innovation and restructuring efforts to revive performance in the diaper segment and in North America.

249,CAG,"The J. M. Smucker Company (SJM  -  Free Report) is slated to release third-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Feb 16. The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether this consumer food and beverage marketer and manufacturer will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. Notably, Smucker has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 1.2% in the trailing four quarters. Let’s see what’s in store this time.J.M. Smucker Company (The) Price and EPS Surprise  J.M. Smucker Company (The) Price and EPS Surprise | J.M. Smucker Company (The) Quote Hurdles in Smucker’s PathSmucker has been witnessing year-over-year decline in bottom line for three straight quarters now, with results being impacted by higher freight costs. For the remainder of fiscal 2018, management expects a rise in freight costs, stemming from industry-wide headwinds. In fact, higher freight costs are anticipated to continue to play a spoilsport in the next fiscal as well. Also, volatile input prices has been a concern for the coffee segment.Coffee prices are highly volatile and are affected by weather, pest infestation, political decisions in coffee-producing countries, worldwide supply and demand, the relative strength of the dollar and speculative trading. Green coffee prices have been rising steadily for some time now, affecting the coffee segments profitability. During second-quarter 2018, profits from the U.S. Retail Coffee segment declined 18.2% due to higher costs of green coffee and unfavorable volume/mix impacts. The same also negatively impacted gross margin for said period. For the quarter under review, the consensus mark for sales and profit for the U.S. Retail Coffee stands at $541 million and $176 million, up from $538 million and $172 million reported in the same period last year, respectively.Apart from this, Smucker remains susceptible to fluctuation in the prices of input commodities such as oil, corn, wheat and soybean amongst others.Focus on Cost Savings & Strategic Partnerships to Fuel ResultsWhile these factors pose concerns for Smucker’s upcoming results, we remain encouraged by the company’s cost-saving efforts from its pet food synergy program. Notably, the company generated savings of roughly $200 million from this program in the last quarter, helping it witness higher profit at its U.S. Retail Pet Foods segment. For the third quarter, the consensus estimate for sales and profit for this segment is pegged at $557 million and $125 million, compared with $551 million and $126 million, respectively.Apart from this, the company plans to achieve $100 million of its $250 million cost-management program by the end of fiscal 2018. Moreover, we remain hopeful about solid prospects from the company’s impressive brands portfolio. Evidently, favorable net pricing for peanut butter and Smucker’s brand largely drove the top line in the second quarter. Other than this, strong performance of several key brands fueled sales in all segments except U.S. Retail Consumer Foods. For the quarter to be reported, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales at this segment is pegged at $510 million, depicting a 1.4% dip from the year-ago figure. However, the consensus mark for profit at this segment is $123 million, representing a 3.4% upside from the year-ago profit.Final Thoughts & Q3 ExpectationsThough higher freight costs, industry headwinds and commodity cost inflation pose threats, Smucker’s focus on cost savings and efficient pricing across core segments should drive its performance in the third quarter. Also, Smucker’s concentration on innovations and alliances with companies such as Dunkin' Brands Group among many others should also yield results.The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at $2.16, which shows an upside of 8% from $2.00 recorded in the year-ago period. This estimate has trended upward by a notch in last 30 days. Moreover, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $1,888 million, up marginally by 0.5% from the year-ago quarter.What the Zacks Model UnveilsTo top it, our proven model shows that Smuckeris likely to beat bottom-line estimates this quarter. For this to happen, a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Encouragingly, Smucker carries a Zacks Rank #3, and possesses an Earnings ESP of +0.84%, which makes us reasonably confident of yet another positive surprise.Other Stocks With Favorable CombinationHere are other some companies that possess the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Ollie's Bargain (OLLI  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +5.32% and carries a Zacks Rank of 2.

250,CAG,"Despite stiff competition and aggressive promotional activities toughening the food industry conditions, Pinnacle Foods Inc. (PF  -  Free Report) has been steadily gaining from acquisitions and business expansion efforts. Notably, shares of this renowned marketer and distributor of food products have gained 9% in the past year, compared with the industry’s decline of 4.3%.Lets now look into the factors impacting Pinnacle Foods performance and see how it is placed for the forthcoming periods.Growth Driving EffortsPinnacle Foods strives to expand market share and strengthen business through strategic buyouts. The acquisition of Boulder Brands (in January 2016) provided Pinnacle Foods a growth platform for refrigerated foods. The benefits from this acquisition are expected to enhance procurement, manufacturing and logistics operations. Further, the company expects to achieve synergies worth more than $15 million in 2017, and projects incremental synergies of $4-6 million in 2018 from Boulder Brands. Other acquisitions which have driven Pinnacle Foods’ business in the past include Duncan Hines, Garden Protein and Wish-Bone.Further, the company plans to expand brands line-up through innovations. In this regard, the company launched Hungry-Man handfuls during the third quarter of 2017, which is a four-line item of hand-held pocket meals. Other noteworthy launches include the introductions of Perfect Size for One, Vlasic purely pickles and Birds Eye product lines.Apart from such initiatives, Pinnacle Foods has been on track with efforts to induce operational efficiency. In fact, productivity savings along with modest net realized pricing and acquisition synergies helped the company offset the impact of input cost inflation during the third quarter. Owing to such efforts, the company expects gross margin to improve 300-400 basis points by 2019. Pinnacle Foods is also pursuing other initiatives to boost profits including low-margin SKU rationalization and increasing the effectiveness of trade promotional spending.Can Efforts Offset Hurdles  Pinnacle Foods has been witnessing sluggish net sales for Specialty segment since five consecutive quarters now. In third-quarter 2017, sales at the segment tumbled 17.2% to $77 million due to reduced volume/mix, impacts from the Aunt Jemima (AJ) exit and lower net price realization. Also, the exit of the gardein private label business and soft food service sales hampered underlying sales, alongside weighing upon the segment margin.Additionally, Pinnacle Foods expects the impact of adverse weather conditions experienced during 2017 to linger in the forthcoming periods as well and lead to increased freight rates. In fact, the company expects input cost inflation of approximately 3% on account of greater-than-anticipated transport costs.Nevertheless, we note that Pinnacle Foods has been steadily expanding its market share. In fact, the third quarter of 2017 marked Pinnacle Foods’ 14th straight quarter of market share growth. Moreover, by deriving strength from business expansion efforts, we expect the company to offset the aforementioned hurdles with ease and continue being in investors’ good books.Do Consumer Staples Stocks Grab Your Attention?

Such agreements are expected to continue bolstering the company’s top line in the forthcoming quarters.Further, we note that SUPERVALU concluded the acquisition of Associated Grocers in December 2017. Going ahead, the company expects this Florida-based company to be a profitable inclusion to SUPERVALU’s wholesale business, given its strong customer and retailer base as well as presence in key international regions.Adapting With Evolving Consumer TrendsOrganic food products are becoming popular owing to rising health consciousness amongst consumers. Thus, the company has been evaluating prospects in the organic foods arena and has partnered with wholesale merchants to explore opportunities in this category.Apart from this, SUPERVALU also strives to improve omni-channel capabilities to resonate with the evolving consumer trends. In this respect, the company is on track with upgrading website and mobile applications to enhance consumer shopping experiences. Recently, the company signed a multiyear contract with Instacart to provide integrated store coupons and loyalty rewards at its e-commerce sites. Such efforts will augment SUPERVALU’s top line in the forthcoming quarters.Weak Retail Businesses: A Major HurdleDespite the above-mentioned upsides, SUPERVALU’s sluggish retail business is a concern. Competitive pressures and lower store traffic has been marring the segment’s performance, lately. Evidently, the retail segment has been facing identical store sales decline for the trailing 10 consecutive quarters.Unfortunately, management continues to anticipate retail business to reel under competitive pressures and price sensitivity. An aggressive promotional environment is also expected to dampen the company’s store sales in the retail segment. Companies such as ConAgra Foods (CAG  -  Free Report) and Kroger (KR  -  Free Report) have also been facing stiff competition, thanks to the growing dominance of industry biggies such as Amazon.com (AMZN  -  Free Report).Though the company is undertaking robust efforts to improve retail segment’s performance, the aforementioned obstacles are likely to make the road bumpy. Additionally, the company is exposed to the risk of input price volatility.What Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Our proven model does not conclusively show that SUPERVALU is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You may uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Although SUPERVALU’s Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) increases the predictive power of ESP, its Earnings ESP of -27.46% makes us less confident about an earnings surprise.

252,CAG,"General Mills Inc. (GIS  -  Free Report) is set to report third-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Mar 21, before market open. Last quarter, the company’s earnings met the Zacks Consensus Estimate. This branded consumer foods company delivered a positive earnings surprise in two of the trailing four quarters, the average miss being 0.89%.General Mills has been reporting dismal revenues since the last few quarters. Much like other U.S. food giants, General Mills too is having a tough time due to the shift in consumer preference toward natural and organic food.Resultantly, the company’s shares have declined 10.3% in the last three months, comparing unfavorably with its industry’s decline of 4.7%. Factors to ConsiderThe company’s total sales improved 2.1% in the last reported quarter, after many quarters of declines. Although General Mills is making significant efforts to drive revenue growth through consumer-focused innovations and marketing initiatives in its key businesses, the company is expected to witness muted sales growth in the third quarter of fiscal 2018. This is due to continued volume declines in North America. Yet, the company expects product innovations to strengthen its brands and bring in some improvements.Segment Wise: Sales and profits at the North America Retail segment, accounting for about 66% of the company’s total sales, have been soft due to lower demand amid weak food industry trends and changing consumer preferences. The trend continued in the first half of fiscal 2018 with segment revenues declining 1.8% in the period. Weak sales in the company’s yogurt category is expected to weigh on its top-line performance in fiscal third quarter.Nonetheless, the company expects product innovations like Chocolate Peanut Butter Cheerios, Oui by Yoplait, fruit snacks and Lärabarand Nature Valley snack bars to bring improvements in cereals, snacks, and frozen meals in the to-be-reported quarter.General Mills’ North America Retail segment sales are expected to witness 0.9% growth year over year but decline 9.1% sequentially to $2.5 billion, per the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Sales in the Convenience Stores & Food Service segment are likely to witness growth of 1.2% from the prior-year quarter but decline 11.3% sequentially. Europe & Australia is projected to report revenues of $455 million, higher than $424.5 million in the year-ago quarter but lower than $467 million in the preceding one. Additionally, the consensus estimate for Asia & Latin America segment revenues of $438 million indicates an increase from $421.2 million in the year-ago quarter but a decrease from $448 million in the prior quarter.Overall, for the fiscal third quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues stands at $3.88 billion, implying 2.3% year-over-year growth.Meanwhile, apart from higher revenues, lower volumes and higher input costs are creating pressure on margins, despite having profound cost-cut initiatives to boost margins amid soft sales. General Mills’ adjusted gross margin contracted 240 basis points (bps), while its adjusted operating margin plunged 220 bps year over year in its last reported quarter. The downside was mainly due to higher input costs and increase in advertising media expenses that offset the benefits of its cost-savings plan.That said, the company expects the margin headwinds to lessen in the second half of fiscal 2018, thereby helping it to boost margins. Primarily, General Mills anticipates its volume to improve, banking on innovation in brand building.Overall, an expected decline in volumes, primarily in North America, higher promotional expenses, as planned for the second half of fiscal 2018, and rising input costs are likely to remain a drag on its bottom line in the to-be-reported quarter. Also, General Mills’ focus on reducing its cost of goods, sold through its margin-improvement plan, along with lower share count is anticipated to give considerable support to its EPS growth.For the fiscal third quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 78 cents, reflecting an increase of 8.3% year over year.Here is what our quantitative model predicts.General Mills has the right combination of two ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP  and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — which increases the odds of an earnings beat.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for General Mills is +0.64%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: General Mills carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-Rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few companies in the Zacks Consumer Staples sector that can be considered, as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in their upcoming releases.Conagra Brands Inc. (CAG  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +4.24% and a Zacks Rank #3. The company is slated to report quarterly results on Mar 22.

253,CAG,"Coty Inc.’s (COTY  -  Free Report) has been steadily gaining from well-planned acquisitions and a strong foothold in the cosmetics industry, supported by leading brands. These factors have been fueling the top line of this cosmetics giant. The company’s shares have rallied 23.5% in the past three months, outpacing its industry’s gain of 17.3%.However, the company is struggling with soft organic sales in Consumer Beauty segment, which dented overall performance.So, let’s see if Coty’s growth drivers can help offset these obstacles and sustain the impressive momentum.Efforts Driving Business GrowthImproved consumer confidence has not only been favoring higher spending on food and beverage items, but has also increased spending on personal care and cosmetic products. Such trends have been boosting Coty’s Luxury and Professional segments performance and have also encouraged the company to engage in business expansion, primarily through buyouts. In fact, Coty has made several strategic acquisitions to enhance its rich line-up of brands. In first-quarter fiscal 2018, the company’s top line improved more than 100% year over year, mainly driven by contributions from the P&G Beauty business buyout and positive synergies from the acquisitions of ghd and Younique. Other evidences in this regard include the buyout of 60% stake in LLC (which forms part of the Consumer Beauty segment). Further, Coty is boosting end-to-end digital transformation efforts including e-commerce in its divisions and regions. The company has been making great strides, which has helped it witness healthy e-commerce sales growth in Consumer Beauty and Luxury segments in the first quarter.Additionally, Coty is committed toward enhancing cost structure. This is well reflected from the fact that the company has been witnessing year-over-year growth in gross margin for four straight quarters now.Consumer Beauty Segment: A Major Concern Unlike the flourishing Luxury and Professional business segments, Coty’s Consumer Beauty category has been sluggish. The segment has been struggling against underlying challenges in North America, thanks to changing consumers’ preferences and a highly competitive environment. Soft market trends in major categories and reduced shelf space for few brands (in the United States and Europe) have been acting as deterrents for Consumer Beauty segment. Evidently, organic sales at this segment tumbled 8% in the first quarter, following declines of 6% and 10% in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2017, respectively.Bottom LineNevertheless, we expect this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company to gain from strategic acquisitions and other business strengthening efforts. In fact, such efforts are likely to improve the performance of Coty’s Consumer Beauty segment and thereby aid the company’s growth trajectory.Do Consumer Staples Stocks Grab Your Attention?

254,CAG,"After witnessing a negative earnings surprise in the second quarter of fiscal 2017,The Kroger Co. (KR  -  Free Report) made a sharp come back in the third quarter. The grocery retailer posted earnings of 44 cents a share that beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 40 cents and increased 7.3% from the prior-year quarter. As a result, shares are up nearly 10% during pre-market trading hours.Nevertheless, management reiterated its fiscal 2017 adjusted earnings guidance of $2.00-$2.05 per share. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2017 is pegged at $1.97.Total sales grew 4.5% to $27,749 million from the prior-year quarter and also came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $27,307 million, marking the fifth straight quarter of revenue beat. Excluding fuel center sales, total sales rose 3%. Digital revenue surged 109% on the back of ClickList.Kroger has been trying all means to overcome stiff competition, which has intensified with the entrance of Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), volatility in food prices, an aggressive promotional environment and waning store traffic. A dominant position among the nation’s largest grocery retailers enables it to boost market share by expanding store base, introducing new items, digital coupons, and order online, pick up in store initiative.The company’s “Restock Kroger” program is reaping results. Kroger commenced “We Are Local” campaign; launched and opened a new restaurant concept, Kitchen 1883; and added two new product lines under “Our Brands”. The company is also passing the benefit of cost containment to customers by lowering prices and launched home delivery in select locations in Southern California in collaboration with Instacart.Kroger Company (The) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Kroger Company (The) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Kroger Company (The) QuoteThese endeavors have helped the shares of Kroger to surge 17.8% in a month compared with the industry that gained 11.7%. We believe that the company's operational strategies present enormous opportunities to augment identical supermarket sales and enhance return on invested capital.The company’s identical supermarket sales (stores that are open without expansion or relocation for five full quarters), excluding fuel center sales, grew 1.1% to $21,629 million, while including fuel center sales, identical supermarket sales jumped 2.4% to $24,605 million. Kroger now envisions fourth quarter identical supermarket sales growth, excluding fuel, to surpass 1.1%.Operating income increased 3.8% year over year to $740 million, whereas operating margin remained flat at 2.7%.Other Financial AspectsKroger, which faces competition from Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report), ended the quarter with cash of $334 million, total debt of $14,847 million, and shareholders’ equity of $6,211 million. Total debt increased $1,011 million from the prior-year period. The company's net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio jumped to 2.57 compared with 2.35 in the year-ago period. In the trailing four quarters, the company bought back $1.7 billion of shares and paid $446 million in dividends.Management projects capital expenditures — excluding mergers, acquisitions and purchases of leased facilities — to be approximately $3 billion for fiscal 2017.Bottom LineWe believe that Kroger’s dominant position enables it to expand store base and boost market share. The company’s customer-centric business model provides a strong value proposition to consumers. However, intensifying price war among grocery stores to lure budget-constrained consumers poses concern.Kroger, which operates 2,790 retail food stores, holds a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

255,CAG,"Conagra Brands, Inc. (CAG  -  Free Report) was upgraded by a notch to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) on Nov 22. Per the Zacks model, companies with a Zacks Rank #2 are likely to perform better than the broader market in the next two to three months.Over the last three months, Conagra’s shares have gained of 3.9%, as against the industry's decline of 2%.Notably, the attractiveness of this stock as a current investment choice is further accentuated by its favorable VGM Score  of B.Factors Behind the Upside Stronger demand for on-trend brands such as Hunts, Peter Pan and Healthy Choice is expected to boost Conagra’s aggregate revenues in the quarters ahead. Moreover, ongoing efforts made to launch new products and grab a large share of market demand are anticipated to strengthen top-line results, going forward. For instance, the Power Bowls rolled out this May and the new varieties of Pam Spray Pumps launched this September would assist in boosting Conagra’s near-term sales.The company anticipates to improve its profitability on the back of stronger revenues, ongoing volume strategy, sturdier supply-chain productivity and price mix enhancements. Meanwhile, Conagra believes that these factors would continue to drive its margin growth by nearly 32% by the end of fiscal 2020. Moreover, wider margins, increased share repurchase and lowered interest expense (as a result of reduced debt burden) are expected to strengthen earnings in the quarters ahead. Conagra’s earnings per share are projected to improve by 7% in the next three to five years.Additionally, Conagra is consistently restructuring its business portfolio through disciplined mergers and acquisitions, and divestments of unwanted assets. To this end, the divestiture of J.W. Swank and Spicetec Flavors & Seasonings businesses (completed in July 2016) is expected to continue boosting the company’s profitability over the long run. Notably, Conagra believes Wesson brand’s spin-off will also complement its portfolio restructuring strategy.Furthermore, strategic buyouts of fast-growing meat snack brands like Duke’s and BIGS (closed in April 2017) as well as Angie's Artisan Treats, LLC acquisition (closed in October 2017) is likely to underpin Conagra’s competency in the near term.Conagra is committed toward its shareholders and augments their returns through lucrative dividend and share buyback programs.

257,CAG,"Pinnacle Foods Inc. (PF  -  Free Report) came out with first-quarter 2018 results, with the top and the bottom lines beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate and improving year over year.

Top-line results during the period primarily benefited from enhanced volume/mix, net price realization and favorable currency impacts. An earlier Easter drove the company’s top-line performance. These upsides were partially countered by the negative impacts of Aunt Jemima (“AJ”) exit. Pinnacle Foods Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Pinnacle Foods Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Pinnacle Foods Inc. Quote Further, the quarter continued to depict sturdy in-market performance. In fact, retail consumption expanded 3.5% along with market share growth of 0.4 points. This marked the company’s 16th consecutive period of growth in composite market share.Moving on, adjusted gross profit for the first quarter came in at $211.2 million, declining 3.1% from the prior-year quarter. Further, adjusted gross margin contracted 130 basis points (bps) to 27.1% on account of increased inflation stemming from transportation costs as well as costs related to innovation outsourcing. These were partially cushioned by improvements in productivity and net pricing.Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) inched up 1% to $121.6 million in the quarter, gaining from the phasing of marketing and advertising spend.Segment ResultsFrozen: Sales increased 7.5% in the quarter to $344.9 million on account of favorable volume/mix, net price realization, currency impacts and earlier Easter timing. Performance of the Frozen segment strongly benefitted from Birds Eye franchise during the quarter, which drove in-market performance. These were partially offset by unfavorable impacts from the AJ exit. Adjusted EBIT in the segment gained 11.8% to $58 million.Grocery: Sales rose 0.6% to $261 million backed by the benefits from an early Easter and improved volume/mix, partially offset by unfavorable net price realization. Retail consumption in the Grocery segment improved during the period, buoyed by strong performance of Vlasic pickles, Armour canned meat, Duncan Hines baking products and syrups business. These upsides were offset by declines witnessed in Wish-Bone. Adjusted EBIT for the segment declined 4.3% to $50.5 million.Boulder: Pinnacle Foods completed the acquisition of Boulder Brands on Jan 15, 2016. Consequently, it became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the company. In first-quarter 2018, sales in the Boulder segment jumped 0.5% to $97.8 million, fueled by favorable volume/mix, partially countered by lower net price realization. Strong performance of the Gardein and Earth Balance businesses also benefited the quarter. Adjusted EBIT for the segment totaled $12.6 million, improving 4.2% from the prior-year quarter.Specialty Foods: Sales tumbled 15% to $75.2 million due to negative impacts of the AJ exit and lower volume/mix. These declines were partially countered by improved net price realization. The segment’s adjusted EBIT came in at $8.3 million, which fell 14.2% from the prior-year quarter.  Other Financial AspectsPinnacle Foods ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $77.6 million, long-term debt of $2,703.7 and total equity of $2,406.4 million.Pinnacle Foods’ net cash flow from operating activities during the first quarter was $121.6 million.

In order to enhance marketing effectiveness, the company announced its partnership with Vayner Media. Such efforts combined with commitment toward innovation are expected to bolster performance in the forthcoming periods.  That said, the company continues to expect adjusted earnings per share for 2018 to be in the range of $2.85-$2.95.

258,CAG,"TreeHouse Foods, Inc. (THS  -  Free Report) reported first-quarter 2018 results, wherein both top and bottom lines came ahead of estimates for the second time in a row. Though results were hurt by increased freight and commodity costs and divestiture of SIF (Canned Soup and Infant Feeding) business, the better-than-expected performance was a treat for investors.  Also, management’s retained view for 2018 even amid these challenges reflect its confidence in strategic growth initiatives. Markedly, shares of TreeHouse Foods gained 8.8% yesterday.Let’s see if the positive sentiment can sustain and help revive this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) stock that has lost almost 48% in a year, compared with the industry’s decline of 17.3%.  Quarter in DetailAdjusted earnings of 18 cents per share plunged considerably by 70.5% year over year. However, earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 13 cents. TreeHouse Foods, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise   TreeHouse Foods, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | TreeHouse Foods, Inc. Quote Net sales of $1,481.2 million came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,428 million. Though sales dropped 3.6% year over year, it was mainly owing to the divestiture of the SIF business. Excluding the impact of divestiture and SKU rationalization efforts, sales climbed 1.9%, courtesy of favorable pricing and currency translations, partly offset by adverse volume/mix. Management blamed the year-over-year fall on soft volume/mix on Beverages, Meals, and Snacks units, along with SKU rationalization endeavors.Gross margin was 15.7% in the quarter, down 290 basis points (bps) from the year-ago figure, due to higher cost of sales stemming from margin improvement initiatives and restructuring activities. Gross margin comparison was also impacted by the reimbursement received in the first quarter of 2017 from product recalls, which was absent this time. Further, gross margin was hurt by increased operating expenses, unfavorable mix and escalated commodity costs (particularly cashews, durum, almonds, packaging, eggs, and oils). These were partially offset by improved pricing.Adjusted operating expenses, as a percentage of sales dipped 0.2 percentage points, thanks to savings from Structure to Win initiative, additional cost-saving efforts and lower amortization costs. This was somewhat negated by escalated freight costs. Adjusted EBITDA fell 30.6% to $106.8 million, while the adjusted EBITDA margin contracted 280 bps to 7.2%.Segment DetailsThe company’s reportable segments are organized by products and are classified into Baked Goods, Beverages, Condiments, Meals, and Snacks.Baked Goods: Sales from the segment rose 1.4% to $346 million. This resulted from improved pricing, positive currency impact and better volume/mix — courtesy of greater distribution mainly in the cracker and cookies category. Direct operating income margin for the segment contracted 420 bps to 8.1% owing to escalated commodity, freight and warehouse expenses, somewhat cushioned by reduced operating costs.Beverages: Sales tumbled 7% to $249.1 million, thanks to unfavorable volume/mix and pricing both largely owing to greater competition. During the quarter, direct operating income margin declined 610 bps to 15.8% owing to lower pricing, higher commodity expenses (mainly oil), adverse volume/mix and escalated freight costs. These were partially compensated by lower SG&A expenses.Condiments: Sales for the segment rose 1.6% to $315.2 million as a result of positive pricing and foreign exchange rates, negated by unfavorable volume/mix. The latter was a result of SKU rationalization efforts and intense competition in the pickles, sauces and jams categories. Direct operating income margin declined 160 bps to 8.6%, primarily due to higher commodity costs (primarily eggs and packaging), increased operating costs and increased freight expenses. This was somewhat compensated by positive currency and reduced SG&A costs.Meals: Net sales tanked 14.5% to $277 million primarily owing to the divestiture of the SIF business, along with adverse volume/mix stemming from competition. Sales were somewhat cushioned by improved pricing. Direct operating income margin increased 30 bps to 10.8%. The upside was mainly due to reduced operating expenses and a fall in SG&A, partly negated by increased commodity costs (mainly durum) and high freight costs.Snacks: Net sales from the segment inched higher by 1.1% to $293.9 million, owing to improved pricing (related to commodity-based price increases), partially countered by unfavorable volume/mix due to competition. Direct operating income margin crashed 200 bps to 2.3% due to increased commodity costs (particularly of cashews), and greater freight and operating costs. These were partially compensated through lower SG&A expenses.Other Financial UpdatesThe company concluded the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $128.5 million, long-term debt of $2,533.2 million and shareholders’ equity of $2,219.8 million.Net cash from operating activities in the quarter was $57.8 million, while free cash flow was $16.4 million.During the quarter, TreeHouse Foods bought back 0.4 million shares for $17.1 million and plans to make buybacks of $50 million under the plan. Apart from this, management speculates repurchasing additional shares up to $100 million in 2018.2018 & Q2 OutlookManagement remains encouraged about exploiting the opportunities in the significant private label space. The company remains focused on curtailing costs and aligning capacities with consumer needs efficiently.Further, management is on track with its TreeHouse 2020 initiative, which is expected to contribute operating margin growth of nearly 300 bps over the next three years, while it also expects annual savings of about $55 million from its Structure to Win plan.However, increased freight and commodity costs are likely to remain headwinds for some time now. Management also expects volume/mix to remain unfavorable in the second quarter, due to SKU rationalization efforts. These factors, along with an expected operational drag raise concerns for the second quarter. Nevertheless, SG&A savings and amortization and tax gains should provide some respite.That said, TreeHouse Foods reiterated its earnings guidance for 2018, alongside issuing a fresh view for the second quarter.For 2018, the company continues to envision earnings in the band of $2.00 to $2.40 per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 currently stands at $2.07.Management anticipates second quarter sales in a range of $1.3-$1.4 billion. Earnings for the second quarter are expected in the range of 20-30 cents per share, reflecting sequential improvement courtesy of favorable pricing, SG&A control and operational gains. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the second quarter stands at 33 cents.Unsure About TreeHouse Foods?

259,CAG,"McCormick & Company Inc. (MKC  -  Free Report) is offering investors a treat, courtesy of its spectacular earnings and sales history backed by well-chalked buyouts, robust savings efforts and effective marketing policies.Evidently, shares of this seasonings, spices and specialty foods giant have returned 12.4% over the past six months, outperforming the industry’s decline of 1.2%. In fact, the company’s shares recently hit a new 52-week high of $111.46 during the trading session on Mar 12, eventually closing at $110.69.Let’s take a closer look at the factors driving the company’s impressive performance and see if it can add new strides to its growth story in the forthcoming periods.Acquisitions: A Vital Growth DriverMcCormick has been strengthening its presence through acquisitions to expand its portfolio. Notably, a number of companies operating in the food industry such as Campbell Soups (CPB  -  Free Report), Kellog (K  -  Free Report) and Conagra Brands (CAG  -  Free Report) have been resorting to strategic buyouts and widen their prospects.  In fact, McCormick’s acquisition of the food division of Reckitt Benckiser Group plc (RB Foods) in August 2017, is the largest deal till date. The deal has enabled the addition of iconic brands to McCormick’s portfolio, thereby positioning the company in the leading U.S. condiments category.In the past, the company has made significant acquisitions, including that of Italy-based Enrico Giotti SpA (Dec 2016) and Australia-based Botanical Food Company (April 2016). Markedly, additional sales from buyouts of RB Foods, Giotti and Gourmet Garden contributed 6% to the company’s constant currency sales growth in fiscal 2017. Also, management expects additional sales from RB Foods to contribute 8% to fiscal 2018 sales growth.Cost-Saving EffortsMcCormick focuses on saving costs and enhancing productivity through its ongoing Comprehensive Continuous Improvement (CCI) program. The program has enabled the company to increase investments, which lead to higher sales and profits. Notably, cost savings through CCI and streamlining actions reached $117 million in fiscal 2017, up from $109 million in fiscal 2016. McCormick is on track with its four-year targeted savings of around $400 million by November 2019. Notably, cost savings from CCI helped the company deliver double-digit adjusted operating income growth in the fourth quarter. The adjusted operating margin expanded 220 basis points (bps), marking the eighth consecutive quarter of margin improvement. Further, gross margin increased 180 bps in the fourth quarter and is likely to expand in a range of 150-20 basis points in fiscal 2018. The company projects adjusted operating income growth in the range of 23-25% in fiscal 2018, wherein it plans to achieve cost savings of $100 million.    Innovation & Inclination Toward Healthy Food OfferingsMcCormick regularly enhances products through innovation to stay competitive and tap the evolving demand for new flavors, spices and herbs. Health and wellness continues to bolster the innovation agenda. The company is planning to offer innovative flavors in breakfast platform and ready-to-serve gravies. McCormick is also shaping up its portfolio with gluten-free, non-GMO and organic products to cater to the evolving needs of consumers. In 2016, the company renovated its core products, with non-GMO labeling on everyday spices and seasonings.Escalated Costs a WorryMcCormick continues to incur higher raw material costs and witnesses increased brand marketing and freight expenses. Rising costs affected the company’s performance in the fourth quarter. In fiscal 2018, the company expects material costs to escalate in low-single digits. Further, McCormick is also planning to increase brand marketing expenses to drive sales.Wrapping it UpAlthough McCormick has been struggling against escalated expenses, we expect such downturns to be sufficiently cushioned by the company’s well-planned savings and efficiency building initiatives. Moreover, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s rich portfolio of iconic brands combined with sustained efforts keeps it well positioned to achieve greater highs in the forthcoming periodsYou can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Zacks Top 10 Stocks for 2018In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest buy-and-hold tickers for the entirety of 2018?Last year's 2017 Zacks Top 10 Stocks portfolio produced double-digit winners, including FMC Corp. and VMware which racked up stellar gains of +67.9% and +61%.

260,CAG,"Conagra Brands, Inc. (CAG  -  Free Report) recently enhanced its Slim Jim brand’s portfolio by rolling out three new varieties of Premium Smoked Sticks. Share price of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock remained nearly flat at $33.79 per share as of Oct 11, after news of the launch surfaced.Conagra Brands Inc. Price  Conagra Brands Inc. Price | Conagra Brands Inc. QuoteInside the HeadlinesSmokehouse Original, Memphis Style BBQ and Thai Style Chili are the three categories of Slim Jim Premium Smoked Sticks introduced by Conagra. These sticks are a unique type of meat snack, including advantages of both jerky and sticks. Conagra noted that these snacks are made of high-quality ingredients and sophisticated flavors. Moreover, these sticks are seasoned with the appropriate balance of spices, herbs, peppers and are slow-cooked for more than 14 hours. Notably, each stick is 100% premium pork or 100% grass-fed beef, including minimum 10 grams of protein.Conagra stated that its new Premium Smoked Sticks will soon be available at various mass retailers and convenience stores across the United States. Notably, 1.2 ounce (oz) and 4.1 oz packs of Smoked Sticks will be available at $1.79 and $4.99, respectivelyConagra noted that the roll out of three new Slim Jim Premium Smoked Sticks boosts its innovation-based growth trajectory. Also, it will likely enhance its snacking products portfolio. Over the past few months, the company has taken bold moves for fortifying its snacking business. For instance, the acquisition of Duke’s and BIGS (April 2017) as well as the recently-inked deal to buy Angie's Artisan Treats, LLC (Sep 22, 2017) are anticipated to augment Conagra’s snacking business sales in the quarters ahead.Stocks to ConsiderBetter-ranked stocks in the industry are listed below:McCormick & Company, Incorporated (MKC  -  Free Report) currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

261,CAG,"On Dec 26, we issued an updated research report on premium consumer goods company Conagra Brands, Inc. (CAG  -  Free Report).  Existing ScenarioOver the last three months, shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company yielded a return of 14.9%, outperforming 6.8% growth recorded by the industry.The company reported better-than-expected results for second-quarter fiscal 2018 (ended Nov 30, 2017).Conagra’s net sales were up 4.1% and organic sales improved 2.3% in the fiscal second quarter fiscal, both on a year-over-year basis. The upside was driven by elevated sales of the company’s renowned branded products such as Healthy Choice, Marie Callender, Slim Jim, Duke's, Bigs and Frontera. Moreover, favorable price-mix, product-mix and customer-mix boosted the quarterly top-line results. The company also noted that amid margin pressure, its adjusted earnings had improved year over year during the quarter, primarily on the back of stronger top-line performance. We believe these positives will continue to bolster Conagra’s results in the quarters ahead.Also, Conagra consistently restructures its product portfolio through disciplined mergers & acquisitions, and major divestitures. For instance, the divestiture of J.W. Swank and Spicetec Flavors & Seasonings businesses (July 2016) has been stoking its top-line growth. Notably, Conagra expects that the Wesson brand’s spin-off (May 2017) will also complement its portfolio-restructuring strategy. On the other hand, the Angie's Artisan Treats, LLC acquisition (October 2017) as well as the latest Sandwich Bros. acquisition (December 2017) are anticipated to drive the company’s revenues in the near term.Further, Conagra is highly committed toward its shareholders and intends to provide adequate returns on the back of dividends and share buyback offers. During the fiscal second quarter, the company repurchased roughly 8 million shares for $280 million. Conagra is on track with its motto to buy back shares worth $1.1 billion in fiscal 2018.However, prices of various raw inputs used by Conagra are highly sensitive to demand and supply imbalances, as well as changes in government’s agricultural policies. Input price inflation often hurts the company’s margins by remarkably flaring up its raw material, packaging, energy and operational costs. For instance, in the recently-reported quarter, Conagra’s gross profit margin contracted 100 basis points year over year. The company stated that this downside largely stemmed from price inflation of certain major inputs, including animal proteins, dairy and oils. The company predicts that it will experience roughly 3.7% cost inflation in fiscal 2018 (higher than 3.3% predicted in the preceding quarter).Conagra also mentioned that tropical hurricanes during the fiscal second quarter adversely affected its revenue-generating and profit-making prospects. The company noted that consumer pantry stocking and warehousing activities had significantly increased during the quarter (especially across grocery and snaking businesses) due to these hurricanes. This would result in sales decline in the upcoming quarters. Furthermore, these environmental hazards escalated the company’s warehousing and transportation expenses, in turn hurting operating margins.In addition to the above, Conagra conducts its business in a highly competitive industry. Intense competition increases the bargaining power of consumers and exposes the company to risks of market-share loss. Moreover, in order to increase or retain demand from prospective end users, Conagra not only needs to ensure good product quality and prices but also has to maintain greater corporate transparency by ascertaining health and wellness aspects of products. Maintaining the desired level of transparency often becomes challenging for the company.Other Stocks to ConsiderSome other top-ranked stocks in the same space are listed below:Greencore Grp (GNCGY  -  Free Report) currently sports a Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy).

On a constant-currency basis, total revenues increased 2%. Results for the quarter include the benefit of the new revenue recognition standard. However, the top line was impacted by lower Active Representatives, mainly in Brazil and Mexico along with challenges in key markets, particularly in Brazil.However, Active Representatives declined 4% compared with the prior-year quarter, driven by fall in South Latin America and North Latin America. Ending Representatives dipped 1% on account of softness in South Latin America and North Latin America, offset by growth in Europe, Middle East & Africa. Moreover, average orders improved 6% and price/mix rose 5% while total units sold dropped 3%.Adjusted gross margin contracted 280 basis points (bps) year over year to 58.4%, driven by higher supply-chain costs, partly negated by positive impact from price/mix. Further, gross margin included a 310 bps negative impact from the adoption of the new revenue standard.Adjusted operating margin expanded 100 bps to 4%. The year-over-year increase was due to lower bad-debt expenses, particularly in Brazil; partly compensated by higher Representative, sales leader and field expenses.

Further, revenues were impacted by the decline in Brazil, partly negated by growth in Argentina, due to inflationary pricing.North Latin America’s revenues inched up 1% to $195.6 million and declined 3% in constant-dollars, attributable to 6% fall in Active Representatives, offset by 3% increase in average orders.

263,CAG,"General Mills Inc. (GIS  -  Free Report) is set to report second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Dec 20, before market open. Last quarter, the company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 7.79%.This branded consumer foods’ company delivered a positive earnings surprise in two of the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 1.74%.Factors to ConsiderGeneral Mills has been reporting dismal revenues for the last few quarters. Much like other U.S. food giants, General Mills too is having a tough time due to the shift in consumer preference toward natural and organic food.Although General Mills is making significant efforts to drive revenue growth through consumer-focused innovations and marketing initiatives in its key businesses, the company is expected to witness muted sales growth in the second quarter of fiscal 2018. This is due to continued volume declines in North America.Although the company expects organic sales to improve in the second quarter sequentially, we believe that the company needs time to register growth. The company expects product innovations, promotions during key seasons for soup and refrigerated dough, and investments in compelling media campaigns to strengthen its brands, will bring in improvements.Sales and profits at the North America Retail segment, accounting for about 65% of the company’s total sales, have been soft due to lower demand amid weak food industry trends and changing consumer preferences.Again, lower volumes and higher input costs are creating pressure on margins despite having profound cost-cutting initiatives to boost margin amid soft sales. General Mills’ adjusted gross margin contracted 230 basis points (bps), while its adjusted operating margin plunged 210 bps year over year in its last reported quarter. The downside was mainly due to continued decline in volumes, higher input costs on imported products, increase in advertising media expenses, and unfavorable mix that offset the benefits of its cost-saving plan.For the to-be-reported quarter, the company expects the factors to turn favorable. Primarily, General Mills anticipates its volume to improve, banking on innovation in brand building. Hence, the rate decline of the company’s adjusted operating margin is expected to lessen in the second quarter (Read more: Will General Mills Witness Improved Margins in Q2?).Overall, an expected decline in volumes, primarily in North America, higher promotional expenses, as planned for the second half of fiscal 2018, and rising input costs are likely to remain a drag on its bottom line in the to-be-reported quarter. Then again, General Mills’ focus on reducing its cost of goods sold through its margin-improvement plan along with lower share count is anticipated to give support for its EPS growth to some extent.For the fiscal second quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 82 cents, reflecting a decline of 3.2% year over year. Meanwhile, the consensus estimate for revenues is pegged at $4.06 billion, implying a 1.2% decline.Here is what our quantitative model predicts.General Mills does not have the right combination of ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP  and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — which increase the odds of an earnings beat. Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for General Mills is -1.93%.

264,CAG,"Church & Dwight Co., Inc.’s (CHD  -  Free Report) continued focus on product innovations and strategic acquisitions has been fueling its performance for quite some time now. While the company gained from broad-based growth in third-quarter 2017, its Consumer International business has been doing exceptionally well. Evidently, consistent strength at this segment has been driving the company’s overall organic sales growth for more than a year now.In the third quarter, organic sales in the consumer international segment jumped 6.2% thanks to higher volumes. Also, overall consumer international sales surged 21.7% on the back of extensive sales of household and personal care items. Incidentally, sales at this segment received considerable impetus from FEMFRESH, OXICLEAN and STERIMAR in the export business, STERIMAR and ARM & HAMMER baking soda in Mexico, FEMFRESH in Australia as well as ARM & HAMMER cat litter and BATISTE in Canada.The consumer international business has been a growth driver for the past few years, and exceeded expectations with 11.8% and 7.4% organic growth in the first and second quarters of 2017, respectively. Prior to that, the international business grew 8% in 2015 and 10% in 2016. Further, the company is opening new offices in order to support increase in export business, and it continues to invest in the consumer international business to sustain its strong sales growth.Notably, continued strength at this business, along with solid growth in Consumer Domestic and Specialty Products businesses, drove Church & Dwight’s results in the third quarter. Both top and bottom lines grew year over year and came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Despite bearing the brunt of hurricanes, organic sales advanced 3.2%, thereby retaining its year-over-year growth trend. While this marked the company’s fourth consecutive quarter of positive earnings surprise, sales have outpaced the consensus mark in 12 out of the last 14 quarters now. Clearly, the company’s investment spending is paying off.  However, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s shares have lost 8.8% over the past six months, as against the industry’s gain of 3%.The company has been witnessing high promotional and coupon expenses, which is hurting its gross margin. Evidently, gross margin contracted 10 basis points (bps) and 80 bps in the third and second quarters of 2017, respectively. In third-quarter 2017, gross margin was hurt by high promotional costs, input cost inflation and unfavorable currency movements. SG&A expenses also escalated on account of higher R&D costs, which in turn weighed upon operating margin. Further, the company witnessed higher marketing costs to support innovations and expects similar trends in the fourth quarter.Nevertheless, Church & Dwight’s stable portfolio of value and premium products, launch of innovative products, and aggressive productivity programs should keep driving its performance. In addition, continued strength in the Consumer International unit, along with growth across other segments, keeps us encouraged.Looking for More Promising Stocks?

The company offers canola, corn, vegetable and blended oils under this brand.Over the last month, Conagra’s shares have rallied 6.2%, outperforming 1.3% growth recorded by the industry.This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock is poised to grow on the back of strategic portfolio-restructuring moves and stronger sales.

266,CAG,"The J. M. Smucker Company (SJM  -  Free Report) has decided not to proceed with the planned acquisition of Wesson oil brand from Conagra (CAG  -  Free Report) – deal that was announced back in May 2017. Both companies have mutually decided to call of the $285-million deal, following the U.S. Federal Trade Commission’s (""FTC"") administrative complaint against the planned acquisition (filed on Mar 5).The FTC was of the opinion that the inclusion of Wesson cooking oil in Smucker’s portfolio would lower competition and create Smucker’s monopoly in the canola and vegetable oils space in the United States. This is because Smucker already owns Crisco brand, which currently competes with Conagra’s Wesson oil brands. Notably, the neck-to-neck competition between these staple brands keeps prices of their products under check.However, had the deal materialized, Smucker would control at least 70% of the branded canola and vegetable oil sales to grocery stores and other retailers. Thus, the merger of Wesson oil brands and Crisco would clearly wipe out their existing competition — thereby giving Smucker a considerable edge to raise prices. Per the FTC, Smucker’s strengthened negotiating power would be a hindrance for retailers (traditional grocers in particular) and ultimately for customers who would have to bear the brunt of higher prices of branded canola and vegetable cooking oil.The Road Ahead for Smucker Post FTC AllegationWhile the FTC’s charges address the concerns of retailers and consumers, Smucker stated that it doesn’t agree with the FTC’s inference. Also, per Smucker, the FTC was unable to assess the contribution of private label brands in the oils space — which account for about half of the total cooking oil sales and hold solid market share at some retailers. Management further revealed that this deal was likely to generate noteworthy cost synergies — which would protect the competitive position of branded oil products.Incidentally, when the deal was announced, Smucker expected annual net sales of $230 million and additional adjusted earnings of 10 cents per share in the first full year of the closing of the buyout. The company also projected annual cost synergies of about $20 million within two years of the closing of the deal.However, despite being disheartened with the FTC’s conclusion, Smucker and Conagra decided to abort the plan. This is because both companies were not in favor of investing the considerable amount of time and resources it would need to counter FTC’s charges. Nevertheless, Smucker remains focused on enriching customers’ experience with its Crisco brand and oils business.Markedly, Smucker’s top line has been gaining from its focus on strategic partnerships, buyouts and improved performance of its brands. To this end, Smucker teamed up with quite a few coffee companies. Its agreement with Keurig Green Mountain and Dunkin’ Brands Group to manufacture and sell the K-Cup category of products, has been yielding positive results since fiscal 2016. The company has been consistently extending partnership with KGM to augment K-Cup business opportunities.Further, the growing popularity of certain brands has encouraged the company to undertake innovations. Notably, management stated that products launched over the past three years delivered net sales growth of nearly 7% during the third quarter. Additionally, the company plans to introduce Milk-Bone Puffs dog treats and Dunkin' Donuts coffee canisters by the end of fiscal 2018.Driven by such factors, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock has rallied 22.7% in the past six months, as against the industry’s dip of 0.8%.Looking for More?

268,CAG,"It goes without saying that the food industry has been suffering from lower sales owing to the changing eating pattern of consumers and their preference for healthy, fresh and organic food products.That said, overlooking the industry will not be prudent as there are several companies with a decent performance history and strong fundamentals, signaling at a profitable investment opportunity. After all, year-end seasonal factors will continue to drive stocks higher.Medifast, Inc. (MED  -  Free Report) is one such company that continues to show strength in a number of areas. Therefore, adding the stock to your portfolio should not be a disappointment. Shares of Medifast have surged more than 73% so far this year, against the industry’s loss of 5.2%. Also, the company outperformed the industry in all the other time frames we considered – 4-week, 12-week and 52-week.Moreover, earnings estimates have moved north in the last few weeks reflecting investor’s optimism on Medifast. Over the last 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter and full-year 2017 earnings increased 2.1% and 2.4%, respectively. Also, earnings estimate for 2018 have increased 4% in the same time frame. This bullish analysts’ sentiment justifies the company’s Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and why we are expecting it to outperform in the near term.  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Notably, this leading manufacturer and distributor of clinically proven healthy living products and programs show strengths in several key areas as well.What Makes Medifast a Solid BetStrong Growth Initiatives and Upbeat Guidance: Medifast remains focused on growing the direct selling revenues, OPTAVIA business unit and IT systems.Medifast’s solid financial performance in the last reported quarter reflects early success of its strategic growth initiatives. The company has also achieved its record number of quarterly active OPTAVIA coaches along with the highest quarterly revenue for its OPTAVIA business unit in the same period. It believes that the company is well positioned for future growth and value creation for its shareholders backed by its positive business momentum combined with scalable infrastructure and strong balance sheet.For 2017, Medifast raised its earnings guidance following an impressive result in the first three quarters of the year. The company now expects the bottom line to be in the range of $2.15-$2.18 per share (up 13% to 15% year over year) compared with $2.05-$2.15 per share, projected earlier.Impressive Expected Earnings & Revenue Growth: The company’s earnings for 2017 are expected to increase 14.8% year over year, comfortably outpacing the industry’s average projected growth of 6.9%. Meanwhile, Medifast’s projected sales growth is a healthy 8.1%, higher than the industry average of 1.3%, thereby making it a great pick in terms of growth investment.In the next year, the company’s EPS growth is expected to increase 19.8% on 13.8% growth in revenues.Higher Return on Equity & Low Beta: Medifast’s trailing 12-month return on equity (ROE) supports its growth potential. ROE in the trailing 12 months is 24.1% while the industry gained 12%, reflecting the company’s efficient usage of shareholders’ funds.Again, a stock with beta less than 1 suggests that the price movement of the stock is not highly correlated with the market. Since they are less volatile than the market, they are safer bets at the moment. Medifast has an impressive beta of 0.51. Adding it to your portfolio brings down your portfolio’s overall beta, thereby reducing its risk.Solid VGM Score: Medifast has a VGM Score of B. Our VGM Score identifies stocks that have the most attractive value, growth, and momentum characteristics.

270,CAG,"United Natural Foods, Inc. (UNFI  -  Free Report) is slated to release second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Mar 8, after the market closes. Notably, the company’s bottom-line results have outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 2.3%.Considering this, let’s delve into how things are shaping up for this announcement and see if this renowned distributor of natural, organic and specialty food and non-food products can maintain its positive earnings surprise streak.Factors Likely to Drive United NaturalsManagement believes that United Natural is well placed for growth, considering consumers’ demand for the company’s better-for-you food products and services in all channels including supernatural, supermarket, food service and e-commerce. To further improve results, the company laid out several initiatives for 2018 which includes enhancing customer base; expand cheese, deli and meat categories into the broadline distribution channel; improve gross margin; expand e-commerce operations and retain focus on mergers and buyouts. To this end, United Natural is striving to enhance e-commerce space through investments in technology and infrastructure. Driven by these efforts, e-commerce sales surged more than 30% in the first quarter, with food service e-commerce sales recording its highest quarter of year-over-year growth in a while. Management projects robust opportunities in this regard, based on impressive distribution network and solid brands portfolio. United Natural Foods, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  United Natural Foods, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | United Natural Foods, Inc. Quote Acquisitions have also been another vital factor driving United Natural’s performance. The buyouts of Haddon House and Gourmet Guru have been boosting the company’s top line for a while. Such takeovers have helped the company expand resource strength and achieve greater operating scale. Synergies resulting from the integration of the buyouts are expected to benefit performance in the second quarter as well.All said, United Natural’s stringent focus on growth initiatives along with broad-based improvement in important sales networks have raised management’s hopes to deliver sturdy performance in the second quarter. Alongside first-quarter results, management stated that it continued to witness record sales and shipping unit volumes in the beginning of the second quarter.Challenges in the WayWe are concerned regarding the grocery industry headwinds that may affect United Natural’s performance. Companies such as ConAgra Foods (CAG  -  Free Report) and Kellogg (K  -  Free Report) have been facing stiff competition, due to the growing dominance of industry biggies such as Amazon.com (AMZN  -  Free Report)    . In this regard, tight margins and an aggressive promotional environment pose concerns.Final ThoughtsNevertheless, we expect the aforementioned growth drivers to cushion the company from these obstacles and boost growth.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings for the second quarter has been stable over the past 30 days at 55 cents per share, which depicts a 10% rise from the prior-year quarter. Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect net sales of $2,445 million for the second quarter, reflecting an improvement of 7% from the year-ago quarter.A Look at the Zacks ModelTo top it, our proven model shows that United Natural is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. A stock needs to have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

271,CAG,"Sysco Corporation (SYY  -  Free Report) recently outlined its key growth strategies at New York Investor Day event, wherein it also highlighted its three-year financial goals. Notably, the company has been gaining from cost-saving and revenue-management efforts for quite some time now, as evident from its impressive past record.These efforts, along with constant focus on buyouts have helped Sysco gain 13.2% this year, as against the industry’s decline of 6%. So let’s delve deeper into Sysco’s plans to achieve its financial targets for fiscal 2020, and see if it can spur further growth of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company. Sysco’s Core StrategiesSysco stated that its four core strategies include enhancing consumers’ experience; optimising business; stimulating power of its people and achieving operational efficacy. In this regard, the company remains focused on enhancing assortments, making constant innovations, ensuring food safety and revitalising brands.Further, to evolve with the changing consumer preferences, Sysco remains committed toward investing in technology and enhancing e-commerce operations.Moreover, the company plans to improve supply chain, increase transparency through technological advancements, enhance deliveries and attain operational efficiency. Clearly, the company intends to keep customers interests at the centre of business.Well, Sysco’s focus on undertaking innovative technologies to fuel efficiency is clear from its recently announced investment in Tesla (TSLA  -  Free Report). Incidentally, the company revealed that it reserved 50 new fully-electric Semi tractors at Tesla to introduce alternative-fuel vehicles to its fleet. This move will not only be environment friendly, but is also likely to curtail Sysco’s fuel and transportation expenses considerably.Financial TargetsMoving back to the company’s four core strategies, management believes that these will help it achieve its financial goals for fiscal 2020. The company expects gross profit to rise in a band of 55-65%, while it anticipates reducing administrative expenses by 20-25%. Consequently, the company plans to achieve adjusted operating income growth of about $650-$700 million by fiscal 2020 end, reflecting a three-year CAGR of 9%.Moreover, management envisions earnings per share to grow at a double-digit rate on an average, by 2020. Additionally, the company’s solid balance sheet and free cash flow augmenting ability will help it make business investments, continue with merger and acquisitions, make share buybacks, repay debt and attain a preferred dividend payout ratio of 50-60% over time. Also, Sysco expects ROIC to be roughly 16% in fiscal 2020.All said, we believe that these strategic priorities are likely to aid the company enhance customers’ experience, drive growth and in turn augment shareholder value.Looking for More?

272,CAG,"In line with the strategy to diversify its organic offerings, Kellogg Company (K  -  Free Report) entered into an agreement to acquire protein bar maker, Chicago Bar Company.Chicago Bar Company makes RXBAR, which is considered the fastest growing nutrition bar brand in the United States.Transaction DetailsThe acquisition, valued at $600 million or $400 million net of tax benefits, is anticipated to close by 2017-end. Chicago Bar Company will operate as an independent business within Kellogg.RXBAR expects to generate net sales of $120 million in fiscal 2017. Kellogg expects the multiple on projected 2018 EBITDA to be in the 12x-14x range, inclusive of the tax benefits to the purchase price. The acquisition however will not be accretive to earnings in 2017 and 2018, excluding one-time costs.Buyout BenefitsThe addition of “clean-label, high-protein” RXBAR can be expected to revive Kellogg’s wholesome snacks business, which has been weak over the past few quarters. The U.S. snacks business has been struggling since 2013 owing to weak volumes. Though Pringles has been performing well, the deterioration in U.S. snacks is stemming from weakness in weight-management products like Special K bars, Special K cracker chips and Right Bites' 100-calorie cookie packs. In the first six months of 2017, the snacks segment’s net sales dropped 3% year over year.Kellogg is poised to benefit from RXBAR’s immense brand appeal and strong online presence. RXBAR, on the other hand, will be able to capitalize on Kellogg's scale and resources to accelerate growth.Kellogg is innovating and diversifying its line of offerings to keep up with changing consumer needs and counter the weak sales trajectory, similar to food giants like General Mills Inc. (GIS  -  Free Report), Conagra Brands Inc. (CAG  -  Free Report) and The Hershey Company (HSY  -  Free Report).Persistently soft sales have led to a 18.4% decline in the company’s shares in the past year. The stock has also been trading below its industry. Current-year estimates for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock went down 0.3% in the last 30 days but remained stable for next year.

273,CAG,"General Mills Inc. (GIS  -  Free Report) is foraying outside of food for human consumption, as it intends to buy Blue Buffalo Pet Products Inc. . Notably, this buyout is the latest by the food giant, seeking to expand in the $30 billion U.S. pet food market and reshape its portfolio as it struggles with weak demand amid changing consumer preferences.The DealGeneral Mills will pay Blue Buffalo shareholders $40 per share or $8 billion in cash to acquire the company, which will operate as a new pet operating segment. This represents a premium of 17.2% to Blue Buffalo’s closing price as of Feb 22. General Mills’ other four segments are North American retail, convenience stores and foodservice, Europe & Australia and Asia & Latin America.Will General Mills Be Able to Boost Sales With Blue Buffalo Buyout?The U.S. pet food market is a $30 billion industry, growing in the 3-4% range each year. Founded in 2002, Blue Buffalo is the leader in the fastest-growing Wholesome Natural category with double-digit growth in each of the last three years. The Wholesome Natural market represents approximately 10% of the pet food market in volume and 20% in value. Blue Buffalo generates more than $1 billion in yearly sales, profiting from robust demand for its BLUE brand of dog and cat food made with whole meats, fruits and vegetables. Blue Buffalo’s revenues have advanced at an annual compound rate of 12% over the past three years. This reflects significant demand from consumers of upmarket pet food brands.General Mills expects the addition of Blue Buffalo to help the company boost its top as well as bottom line. The company expects Blue Buffalo to be immediately accretive to the company’s top-line and operating margin profile, with bottom-line growth expected in fiscal 2020. Meanwhile, the addition is expected to be neutral to cash EPS in fiscal 2019.General Mills, Inc. Price  General Mills, Inc. Price | General Mills, Inc. QuoteMajor Food Biggies Diversifying to Combat Fading DemandThe packaged-food industry is suffering from waning consumer demand due to the shift in consumer preferences to healthier options. As a result of this, food companies, namely General Mills and Kellogg Company (K  -  Free Report), have been witnessing weak sales over the past few quarters.Big food giants are gradually re-shuffling their shelves and are making niche acquisitions, given tepid demand. For example, in a bid to go beyond chocolate and gain a solid footing in the fast-growing market for healthy snacks, Hershey Co. (HSY  -  Free Report) inked a deal last December to acquire Amplify Snack Brands Inc. — the maker of SkinnyPop and Tyrrell’s potato chips.Kellogg acquired protein-bar maker, Chicago Bar Company in 2017. Chicago Bar Company makes RXBAR, which is considered to be the fastest growing nutrition bar brand in the United States.

274,CAG,"Pinnacle Foods Inc. (PF  -  Free Report) is slated to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Mar 1, before the opening bell. Notably, the company outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 3.1%. Let’s delve deeper into how things are shaping up for this announcement and see if this manufacturer and distributor of branded food products can maintain its positive earnings surprise streak.What to Expect?In the past 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth quarter and 2017 has moved up by a penny to 95 cents and $2.56, respectively. Expected earnings for the quarter under review and 2017 depict a year-over-year rise of 20.3% and 19.1%, respectively. Notably, management expects 2017 adjusted earnings in the range of $2.55-$2.60 per share.Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect net sales of $909.4 million for the fourth quarter, reflecting an improvement of 5.9% from the year-ago quarter. Also, the consensus mark for 2017 sales is pegged at $3.17 billion, reflecting year-over-year growth of 1.2%.Pinnacle Foods, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Pinnacle Foods, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Pinnacle Foods, Inc. QuoteFactors Driving the QuarterPinnacle Foods’ retail segments have been depicting strong in-market performance. Notably, third-quarter 2017 marked Pinnacle Foods’ 14th straight period of market share growth. Moreover, the company’s brand expansion initiatives combined with regular innovation are expected to further strengthen market share. Some noteworthy innovations in the past include new varieties of the Duncan Hines Decadent, Duncan Hines Perfect Size baking kits and Birds Eye product lines.Acquisitions have been another vital growth driver for Pinnacle Foods. The company has been carrying out various acquisitions over the years to expand distribution network and customer base and boost long-term growth. In this regard, the acquisition of Boulder Brands deserves special mention as it has aided the company achieve significant growth in refrigerated foods. Moreover, the company expects to achieve Boulder Brands synergies of more than $15 million in 2017, which will benefit gross margin and SG&A. Further, additional synergies of $4-$6 million are expected in 2018.The company also expects results to be stronger and projects gross margin for 2017 to be in line with 2016. Also, Pinnacle Foods is on track with its network optimization plan and is committed toward achieving its long-term margin goal for 2019 and onward. The company also has an operational excellence program to generate annual productivity savings across the supply chain. Productivity for 2017 is estimated to be little more than 4% of the cost of products sold.Escalated Costs & Weak Specialty Unit Are ConcernsAlthough Pinnacle Foods’ well-chalked growth endeavors look impressive, escalated marketing and freight costs remain potent threats. Incidentally, the company witnessed increased marketing costs in the third quarter, which along with expenses related to discrete items and hurricanes dented the EBIT margin. Additionally, management expects higher freight rates associated with the hurricanes to linger throughout 2017. The company expects input cost inflation to be 3% on account of greater-than-anticipated transport costs.Apart from this, sluggishness in the Specialty segment has been a concern for Pinnacle Foods. Reduced volume/mix, impacts from the Aunt Jemima (AJ) exit and lower net price realizations have been plaguing the segment’s performance as well. Moreover, the exit of the gardein private label business and soft food service sales hampered underlying sales and weighed upon the margin last quarter.Final Thoughts & the Zacks ModelNevertheless, we expect Pinnacle Foods to tide over such hurdles on the back of its efficient brand growth strategies, gains from acquisitions and carefully planned savings, and productivity enhancing initiatives.To top it, our proven model shows that Pinnacle Foods is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter.

275,CAG,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put ConAgra Foods, Inc. (CAG  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, ConAgra Foods has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 20.4,  as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 22.9x. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, ConAgra Foods’ current PE level puts it above its midpoint over the past five years, with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the broader industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 22.6. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that ConAgra Foods has a forward PE  ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 19.9, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for ConAgra Foods stock in the near term too .P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, ConAgra Foods has a P/S ratio of about 1.9. This is significantly lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.6x right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, ConAgra Foods currently has a Value Score of B, putting it into the top 40%  of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes ConAgra Foods a solid choice for value investors.What About the Stock Overall?Though ConAgra Foods might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of B and a Momentum Score of C. This gives CAG a Zacks VGM score — or its overarching fundamental grade — of B. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been mixed. The current quarter has seen one estimate go higher in the past sixty days compared to four lower, while the full year estimate has seen four up and one down in the same time period.This has had just a small impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has decreased by 1.9% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has inched upper by 1.1%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action  for the stock in the chart below:Conagra Brands Inc. Price and Consensus  Conagra Brands Inc. Price and Consensus | Conagra Brands Inc. QuoteThis somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and why we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineConAgra Foods is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Further, with a strong industry rank (among Top 42% of more than 250 industries) instilss our confidence on the stock. However, with a Zacks Rank #3 it is hard to get too excited about this company overall. In fact, over the past two years, the broader industry has clearly underperformed the market at large, as you can see below:So, value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of All                 Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

277,CAG,"Sysco Corporation (SYY  -  Free Report) appears to be investors’ preferred pick, as evident from its solid bull run. This distributor and marketer of food products has seen its shares gain 16.6% in the past six months, when the industry was down 0.6%. The company's impressive growth initiatives have been driving solid results over the past years.However, the company’s European business remains pressurized, thus posing a concern for Sysco’s international performance. Nonetheless, the company’s recently outlined core strategies for 2020 which reflect its strong prospects. So, let’s take a closer look at Sysco’s driving factors and see if they can help the company retain its solid record despite the hurdles.Core Strategies for 2020 Bode WellSysco recently outlined its key growth strategies at its New York Investor Day event, wherein it also highlighted its three-year financial goals.  Sysco stated that its four core strategies include enhancing consumers’ experience; optimizing business; stimulating power of its people and achieving operational efficacy. In this regard, the company remains focused on enhancing its assortments, undertaking innovations, ensuring food safety and revitalizing its brands.Management believes that these game plans will help it achieve its financial goals for fiscal 2020. The company expects gross profit to rise in a range of 55-65%, while it anticipates reducing administrative expenses by 20-25%. Consequently, the company plans to achieve adjusted operating income growth of about $650-$700 million by fiscal 2020 end, reflecting a three-year CAGR of 9%. Moreover, the company envisions earnings per share to grow at a double-digit rate on an average, by 2020.Focus on AcquisitionsThe company has been carrying out various acquisitions over the years to grow its distribution network and customer base and boost long-term growth. Other than sales growth, these acquisitions also enhance its presence in international markets and its product portfolio. In this regard, Sysco recently acquired Hawaii-based HFM FoodService, which will be added to the company’s U.S. Foodservice segment. Other moves in this regard include the buyout Supplies on the Fly; North Star Seafood, Gilchrist & Soames and 50% stake in Mexico-based Pacific Star Foodservice among others.Cost-Cutting Initiatives to Enhance MarginsSysco has been impressively managing expenses since the past few years. In the supply chain area, the company is witnessing positive momentum from its productivity initiatives and ongoing process improvements, which are driving efficiencies specifically in the warehouse. The company achieved $417 million operating income growth since fiscal 2015 and remains on track to achieve the high end of the three-year adjusted operating income growth target of approximately $600 million to $650 million through the end of FY18.Splendid Surprise HistorySysco began fiscal 2018 on a strong note, as both top and bottom lines grew year over year and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the first quarter. While this marked Sysco’s third straight quarter of sales beat, earnings have outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in seven out of the past eight straight quarters now. Results were mainly backed by strength in the company’s U.S. Foodservice Operations despite the dismal impact of hurricanes.European Weakness Raises Concerns for International PerformanceSysco’s International performance remained mixed in the first quarter, mainly due to softness in Europe — which is battling sluggish restaurant traffic and an overall slowdown in Food Away From Home in the United Kingdom. Moreover, weakness in pound sterling resulted in acute food cost inflation in the United Kingdom, thereby leading to pricing pressure. This, in turn hurt volume growth and gross margin in the first quarter. Unfortunately, management expects these headwinds to linger throughout fiscal 2018, which remains a threat to Sysco’s International performance.Further, Sysco generates significant business from its international operations, which are spread across Canada, Europe and Latin America. Evidently, sales from its International Foodservice operations constituted about 20% of the company’s total revenue in the first quarter. Thus, the company remains prone to the risk of unfavorable currency translationsNevertheless, management expects its domestic business to be buoyed by increased consumer demand and traffic. Given these factors, along with the progress of its cost-savings plan, this Zacks Ran #3 (Hold) company remains well placed to witness another solid year.Looking for More?

278,CAG,"The Hershey Co. (HSY  -  Free Report) is likely to acquire Nestle's U.S. confectionery business, which includes brands such as Butterfinger, Baby Ruth, Sno-Caps and Laffy Taffy, per media reports. The chocolate giant may have submitted its final bids on Jan 5, 2018.However, Ferrero, best known for its Nutella chocolate spread and Ferrero Rocher bonbons, is also believed to be among the potential bidders. Ferrero, Hershey and Nestle all declined to comment on the news.In June 2017, Nestle revealed that it was exploring strategic options that include a possible sale of its U.S. chocolate and candy business. In July, Nestle said that the business attracted considerable interest from bidders.Nestle's U.S. confectionery business unit is expected to be worth as much as $2.5 million.Hershey, in a bid to go beyond chocolate and gain a solid footing in the fast-growing market for healthy snacks, inked a deal last month to acquire Amplify Snack Brands Inc. (BETR), the maker of SkinnyPop and Tyrrell’s potato chips for $1.6 billion. In the last two years, Hershey acquired brands like Krave meat jerky and Ripple Brand Collective's barkTHINS as well.Hershey’s president and CEO, Michele Buck, had earlier expressed that the company is optimistic about its chocolate portfolio and is expected to leverage its snack business through potential mergers and acquisitions.Notably, the company’s top-line performance was weak since 2014.  Sales increased a meager 0.7% in 2016 and 1.9% in the first nine months of 2017. Much of the sales debacle could be attributable to consumers’ changing eating patterns and their evolving preferences for healthy, fresh and organic food products. Hence, Hershey is looking for ways to boost its top line.Currently, Hershey and other food companies, like General Mills Inc. (GIS  -  Free Report), Kellogg Co. (K  -  Free Report), Conagra Brands Inc. (CAG  -  Free Report) and others, are regularly adding new products and innovating its core brands to meet consumer demand and needs that are not addressed by its current portfolio.

279,CAG,"United Natural Foods, Inc. (UNFI  -  Free Report) is slated to release first-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Dec 7, after the market closes.The distributor of natural, organic and specialty food and non-food products has a mixed record of bottom-line surprises in the trailing four quarters. Considering this, let’s delve into how things are shaping up for the upcoming announcement.What to Expect? The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first quarter is currently pegged at 59 cents per share and has been stable over the past 30 days. Estimated earnings depict a growth of 1.7% from the prior-year reported figure.Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $2,389 million for the quarter under review, up 4.9% growth from the year-ago quarter.United Natural Foods, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise United Natural Foods, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | United Natural Foods, Inc. QuoteFactors at Play Acquisitions have been favoring United Natural‘s growth for a while. The buyouts of Haddon House and Gourmet Guru boosted the company’s top line in the previous quarter. Such takeovers have enabled United Natural to expand resource strength and achieve greater operating scale. Synergies resulting from the integration of the company buyouts are expected to benefit performance in the first quarter as well. Additionally, the company’s top line has been gaining from rising demand for natural and organic products.Further, the company is likely to gain from restructuring initiatives, aimed at enhancing operating efficiency. Such efforts include reduction of employee severance costs, stemming from the integration of acquired businesses. Moreover, in order to allocate resources more diligently, the company has been exiting less profitable businesses. Such actions are expected to positively impact the company’s bottom line.However, we remain concerned regarding the grocery industry headwinds that may affect United Natural’s performance. Companies such as ConAgra Foods (CAG  -  Free Report) and Kellogg (K  -  Free Report) have been facing stiff competition, due to the growing dominance of industry biggies such as Amazon.com (AMZN  -  Free Report). Tight margins and an aggressive promotional environment also continue to pose as headwinds. Nevertheless, we expect the aforementioned growth drivers to cushion the company from these obstacles and aid growth.What Does the Zacks Model Unveil? Our proven model does not conclusively show that United Natural is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You may uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Although United Natural carries a Zacks Rank #2, its Earnings ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.

282,CAG,"In a bid to go beyond chocolate and gain a solid footing in the fast-growing market for healthy snacks Hershey Co. (HSY  -  Free Report) inked a deal to acquire Amplify Snack Brands Inc.  — the maker of SkinnyPop and Tyrrell’s potato chips.Consequently, Amplify's shares were up 71.6% on Dec 18 while Hershey gained a mere 0.1%.Terms of the DealHershey agreed to buy all outstanding shares of Amplify Snack Brands for $12 a share, which is a 71% premium to Friday’s closing price. Valued at approximately $1.6 billion, the deal includes net debt and a make-whole payment of $76 million related to the Tax Receivable Agreement (TRA).Per the company, the transaction is slated to close in the first quarter of 2018 and will be funded with cash on hand and new debt.  In fact, the acquisition is expected to be accretive to Hershey's earnings in the first year following the deal closure..The accord is also anticipated to generate approximately $20 million in annual run-rate synergies over the next two years.However, the takeover is not expected to affect Hershey’s full-year 2017 guidance, projected earlier.Hershey and Other Food Biggies Diversify to Combat Fading DemandThe packaged food industry is suffering from waning consumer demand due to the shift in consumer preferences to healthier options. In this context, Austin, TX-based Amplify seems to be gaining ground as it offers the better-for-you food products. Apart from owing Skinny Pop popcorn and Tyrrells potato chips, Amplify also owns Oatmega bars made with whey protein from grass-fed cows in New Zealand.Over the past two years, Hershey acquired brands like Krave meat jerky and Ripple Brand Collective's barkTHINS as well. Notably, the company’s top-line performance was weak since 2014.  However, sales increased a meager 0.7% in 2016 and 1.9% in the first nine months of 2017. Persistent macroeconomic challenges in China continued to hurt the company’s result. Notably, soft international sales due to macro headwinds, changing consumer shopping habits and intense competition from the broader snacking environment in the United States were mainly responsible for the sales results.Apart from Hershey, other big food giants are gradually re-shuffling their shelves and are making niche acquisitions, given tepid demand.In a separate press release, Campbell Soup Company (CPB  -  Free Report) unveiled deal to buy Cape Cod chips-maker Snyder's-Lance, Inc.  for $4.87 billion in cash to fight declining soup sales. The No. 5 U.S. healthy savory snacks maker — Snyder's-Lance — also owns brands like Eatsmart veggie snacks.Although Campbell and Hershey operate in different section of food industry, their core products have been suffering from lower demand. Much of the sales debacle could be attributable to consumers’ changing eating patterns and their evolving preferences for healthy, fresh and organic food products.Other biggies like General Mills Inc. (GIS  -  Free Report) and Kellogg Co (K  -  Free Report) are also acquiring or investing in healthier options to boost sales and thereby profits. In line with the strategy to diversify its organic offerings, Kellogg entered into an agreement in October 2017 to acquire protein bar maker — Chicago Bar Company. Chicago Bar Company makes RXBAR, which is considered to be the fastest growing nutrition bar brand in the United States. The addition of “clean-label, high-protein” RXBAR can be expected to revive Kellogg’s wholesome snacks business, which has been weak over the past few quarters.Meanwhile, Conagra Brands Inc (CAG  -  Free Report) took over Boomchickapop popcorn maker — Angie's Artisan Treats — in September 2017.Currently, Hershey and these food companies are regularly bringing innovations to its core brands to meet consumer demand and needs that are not addressed by its current portfolio. Hershey expects innovation to help it achieve its long-term net sales growth target of 2% to 4%.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have gained 10.5% year to date, as against the industry’s loss of 20.6%. Although the Hershey’s earnings estimates for the current quarter and current year remained unchanged, successful innovation and progress in multi-year productivity, and cost-saving initiatives are likely to drive growth for this largest producer of quality chocolate products.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. Zacks Editor-in-Chief Goes """"All In"""" on This StockFull disclosure, Kevin Matras now has more of his own money in one particular stock than in any other.

283,CAG,"Shares of Campbell Soup (CPB  -  Free Report) got canned on Thursday after the company reported both fourth quarter and full-year sales declines. Campbell’s poor performance also helped send the rest of the packaged food industry lower, nearly across the board.Campbell’s fourth-quarter revenues fell by 1% from the year-ago period to $1.664 billion, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.689 billion. The company also failed to meet our earnings estimates, posting earnings of $0.52 a share against the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.55.The canned soup giant’s full-year sales dipped by 1% to $7.890 billion, based mostly on an overall drop in organic sales due to lower volume and greater promotional spending. Campbell’s now projects that full-year revenues could fall by as much as 2% next year.“The operating environment for the packaged foods industry remains challenging due to shifting demographics, changing consumer preferences for food, the adoption of new shopping behaviors and the dynamic retailer landscape,” Campbell’s President and CEO Denise Morrison said in a statement. “In these times, sales growth remains a challenge.”The CEO noted that drastically changing consumer shopping trends have greatly impacted the company’s non-refrigerated canned and bottled goods sales, which are now seemingly outdated. Morrison also pointed to the rise of self-cooking delivery companies, such as Blue Apron (APRN), as well as an increase of private label brands, as major reasons for Campbell’s poor sales.Campbell’s biggest business sector, its soup and juice division, saw its sales sink 3% in its fourth-quarter. Sales of its packaged snack segment, including Pepperidge Farm and Goldfish, were flat. On the bright side, Campbell’s Bolthouse Farms fresh food sector experienced a 1% gain.Still, Thursday’s report marked Campbell’s 11th straight quarterof falling sales. Campbell’s stock tanked by over 7% and touched a new two-year intraday trading low of $46.43 a share.Packaged Food Industry  Campbell’s rough day helped send the rest of the packaged food industry down overall, as the soup maker’s predicament is hardly unique. With companies such as Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), Wal-Mart (WMT  -  Free Report), and Costco (COST  -  Free Report) growing larger, brands hold less and less leverage in price negotiations.“Right now, the retailers, they’re doing better in this round of the fight,” Warren Buffett said in a recent interview with CNBC.Buffett, an investor and Kraft Heinz (KHC  -  Free Report) board member, saw shares of the packaged food powerhouse fall 1.72% on Thursday. Mondelez International (MDLZ  -  Free Report) stock dropped by 2.03%, while shares of Conagra Brands (CAG  -  Free Report) dipped 0.82%.Shares of General Mills (GIS  -  Free Report) and Kellogg Company (K  -  Free Report) both sunk to new 52-week intraday   lows. B&G Foods Inc. (BGS  -  Free Report) also hit a new 52-week low, while Hormel Foods (HRL  -  Free Report) and Pinnacle Foods (PF  -  Free Report) both saw their stock prices dip marginally.One Simple Trading IdeaSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.

286,CAG,"Colgate-Palmolive Co. (CL  -  Free Report) has signed agreements to acquire two professional skin care brands, PCA Skin and EltaMD. The acquisitions are in sync with Colgate’s strategy to focus on high-margin oral care, personal care and pet nutrition businesses.While the terms of the deals remain under cover, management expects both transactions to close in the first quarter of 2018. However, the company does not expect the acquisitions of the fastest-growing professional skin care brands to influence its earnings in 2018.PCA Skin provides medical-grade in-office and take-home skin care products. The brand is also supported by highly professional dermatologists,plastic surgeons and aestheticians. EltaMD is a leader in physician-dispensed sun care services. Together, these brands are expected to generate about $100 million sales in 2017.Having nearly the same size, these brands are mainly distributed in the U.S., China and certain other international markets, through professional skin care channels and online.Following the acquisitions, Colgate plans to operate these brands separately. These are likely to open Colgate’s doors to the professional skin care market, strengthening the company’s global personal care business. Moreover, the buyouts will enhance its presence in the premium global skin care category as these brands have complementary product portfolios and sales forces, and comparable distribution channels.Furthermore, Colgate’s decade-long heritage of delivering strong recommendations by professional experts to its customers should benefit the high-growth, higher-margin brands.Colgate’s Strategic ValuesColgate-Palmolive commands a market-leading position in the oral care and personal care product categories. Colgate’s continued global brand recognition and focus on product innovations and in-store implementations enhance its profitability and increases consumer satisfaction.Colgate closed trading at $74.85, yesterday. Overall, the stock has gained nearly 4.9% in the last three months, against the industry’s decline of 0.4%.In its last reported third quarter of 2017, this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company posted in-line earnings and topped sales estimates. Increased raw material and packaging costs restrained margins. The oral segment of Colgate faced a downturn as consumers shifted to Ayurvedic substitutes. Consequently, it had to resort to different strategic initiatives and incurred higher costs.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the Consumer Staples sector are Meredith Corporation (MDP  -  Free Report), Flowers Foods, Inc.(FLO  -  Free Report) and Conagra Brands Inc.(CAG  -  Free Report), each carrying a Zacks Rank# 2 (Buy).

287,CAG,"It goes without saying that the food industry has been suffering from lower sales for the last few quarters. Much of the sales debacle can be attributed to the changing eating pattern of consumers and their evolving preference for healthy, fresh and organic food products. Again, the industry has been grappling with other challenges like stiff competition, weak margins and aggressive promotional environment.That said, overlooking the industry will not be prudent as there are several companies with a decent performance history and strong fundamentals, signaling at a profitable investment opportunity. After all, year-end seasonal factors will continue to drive stocks higher. Nomad Foods Ltd. (NOMD  -  Free Report) is one such company that continues to show strength in a number of areas and adding the stock to your portfolio should not be a disappointment. So far this year, Nomad Foods’s shares have skyrocketed more than 71% against the industry’s loss of 4.9%. Also, the company, engaged in the manufacturing and distribution of frozen food items, primarily in the U.K., Italy, Germany, Sweden, France and Norway, outperformed the industry in all the other time frames we considered – 4-week, 12-week and 52-week.In fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year and next-year earnings have moved north by 1.8% and 3.1%, respectively, over the last 30 days. This bullish sentiment of analysts justifies the stock’s current Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and why we are expecting it to outperform in the near term. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.What Makes Nomad Foods a Solid BetStellar Performance and Upbeat Views: The company has been witnessing robust performance buoyed by strong organic revenue growth and favorable category performance coupled with market share gains. This momentum is underpinned by a strong balance sheet and a portfolio of market-leading brands. Again, the company has impressive growth prospects within European frozen foods market and beyond.In the last reported quarter, Nomad Foods reported 5.9% organic revenue growth, representing a third consecutive quarter of organic revenue growth and market share expansion. Notably, the company’s U.K. business (largest market) returned to growth in the third quarter following few consecutive quarters of declines. It experienced stellar growth in 10 of its 13 core countries, including the U.K.In the first nine months of 2017, the company registered organic revenue growth of 3.3%, driven by 2.6% growth in volume/mix and 0.7% growth in price. Gross margin expanded 10 basis points year over year.Following the company’s first three quarters, Nomad Foods raised its outlook for 2017. The company now expects organic sales growth of 3% against low-single-digit organic growth expected earlier. The company also raised its 2017 adjusted EBITDA guidance to the range of approximately €325-€327 million against the prior expectation of approximately €320-€325 million. Gross margin is expected to be above 2016, with Q4 expected to show strong year-over-year improvement.Impressive Expected Earnings & Revenue Growth: The year 2017 has been a good year for Nomad Foods and the company remains positive given the prospects of its business in 2018 and beyond.The company’s earnings for 2017 are expected to increase 22.8% year over year, comfortably outpacing the industry’s average projected growth of 6.9%. The company’s projected sales growth is a healthy 6.8%, higher than the industry average of 1.3%.The company’s EPS growth is expected to increase 18.1% the next year on 1.8% growth in revenues.Reasonably Valued Stock: The company currently has a trailing 12-month Price-to-Earnings or P/E ratio of 17.2. This is quite cheap compared with the industry as well as the market at large, as the current P/E for the industry and S&P 500 is at 22.2 and 21.5, respectively. Its lower-than-market positioning calls for an upside in the quarters ahead.Again, the company’s trailing 12-month Price-to-Sales or P/S ratio of 1.32 is lower than the industry’s 1.97x as well as S&P 500’s 3.41x.Other Stocks to ConsiderYou can consider a few other top-ranked stocks in the same space.Conagra Brands Inc.(CAG  -  Free Report) carries a Zack Rank #2. Its earnings are expected to grow 9.2% in this year and 8.7% the next.Medifast, Inc. (MED  -  Free Report), a Zack Rank #2 stock, is expected to witness 14.8% growth in earnings this year and 19.8% for the next.United Natural Foods, Inc. (UNFI  -  Free Report) also carries a Zacks Rank #2. Its earnings are expected to grow 6.8% this year and 7.3% in the next.5 Medical Stocks to Buy NowZacks names 5 companies poised to ride a medical breakthrough that is targeting cures for leukemia, AIDS, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, and other conditions.New products in this field are already generating substantial revenue and even more wondrous treatments are in the pipeline.

288,CAG,"United Natural Foods, Inc. (UNFI  -  Free Report) has been investor’s preferred pick for quite some time, as evident from its solid bull run. This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock has rallied 47.6% in the past six months, outperforming the industry’s decline of 1.7%.United Natural has been riding on effective growth policies. Moreover, a favorable outlook for fiscal 2018 bolsters investor’s optimism on the stock. Let’s take a look into some the factors that have been aiding this leading food distributor’s performance and are likely to help it sustain the momentum.Growth in E-commerceAmongst management’s strategies to enhance performance, e-commerce expansion is a priority. To this end, United Natural strives to strengthen e-commerce space by investing in technology and infrastructure. Driven by such efforts, e-commerce sales jumped more than 30% in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, wherein the food service e-commerce sales recorded highest quarter of year-over-year growth. United Natural’s efforts to expand online operations encouraged management to project robust opportunities in this space, backed by impressive distribution network and solid brands portfolio. Acquisitions: An important Growth DriverThe company has been carrying out various acquisitions over the years to enhance brand portfolio, distribution network, customer base and boost long-term growth. United Natural acquired Haddon House in May 2016 and Gourmet Guru in Aug 2016, which have been contributing to sales. The Gourmet Guru deal helped the company in finding and cultivating emerging fresh and organic brands. It also expanded United Natural’s presence in key urban markets. United Natural’s acquisition of Haddon House Food Products provided greater operating scale and resources to develop product and service offering.Other strides in this regard include United Natural’s buyout of Nor-Cal Produce, Inc (in 2016), Tony’s Fine Foods (in 2014) and Trudeau Distributing Company (in 2013) among many others.Initiatives to Improve Operating EfficienciesUnited Natural has been striving to improve operational efficiencies and has made solid progress in this regard. The company is on track with restructuring plan to curtail expenses to achieve greater efficiency in a highly promotional environment. Moreover, in order to allocate resources diligently, the company has been exiting from less profitable businesses.Solid Q1, Positive on the Road AheadThe aforementioned growth initiatives helped United Naturals to retain its impressive earnings record in the first quarter of fiscal 2018.  Both top and bottom lines improved year over year and surpassed estimates. While earnings marked its third straight beat, revenues crushed its 11-quarter long trend of reporting negative surprises. Solid focus on growth initiatives along with robust consumer demand in all channels fueled results. Evidently sales improved 7.9% year over year during the said period.Management is impressed with the company’s stellar start in fiscal 2018. Additionally, the company continued to witness record sales and shipping unit volumes in the second quarter. Management believes that it is well placed for growth, considering consumers’ strong demand for United Natural’s better-for-you food products and services in all channels including retails stores, food service, e-commerce and international.This encouraged management to raise its previously issued sales and earnings view for fiscal 2018. Management currently expects net sales for fiscal 2018 to grow in a range of 6.2-7.8% to $9.84-$10.0 billion. The company also envisions earnings in the range of $2.72-$2.80 per share, which reflects an improvement of about 6.3-9.4% from the fiscal 2017 figure.All said, United Natural is expected to continue with sturdy performance on the back of dedicated efforts to tap growth opportunities.Do Consumer Staples Stocks Grab Your Attention?

289,CAG,"Conagra Brands, Inc. (CAG  -  Free Report) recently enhanced the Pam brand’s portfolio with the launch of two fresh varieties of PAM Spray Pumps. This move is in sync with the company’s innovation-based growth strategy.What’s New?Extra Virgin Olive Oil and Canola Oil are the two new additions to Conagra’s legendary Pam Spray Pump’s family.  Pam Spray Pumps offer state-of-the-art non-stick cooking experience and can be used for various culinary purposes, such as grilling and baking. PAM Baking, Original PAM Cooking Spray and Coconut Oil Cooking Sprays are some key products offered by this brand.PAM Spray Pumps helps to controlling the usage of oil and butter while cooking, thereby lowering the calorie content in food. Notably, these sprays do not have artificial flavors, colors or preservatives.  Conagra mentioned that these two fresh varieties are currently available in all mass retailing and grocery outlets of the United States.PAM Spray Pumps are now available at grocery stores and mass retailers nationwide.Our TakeThe Food — Miscellaneous industry is highly competitive and witnesses significant propensity of new business entrants. Conagra, Nomad Foods Limited (NOMD  -  Free Report), Associated British Foods PLC (ASBFY  -  Free Report) and Danone (DANOY  -  Free Report) are some major companies dominating this industry. In order to become the leading branded food company in the market, Conagra has been steadily strengthening its competency on the back of several inorganic moves and strategic product innovations.For instance, in Sep 22, 2017, the company inked a definite agreement to acquire Angie's Artisan Treats, LLC, for an undisclosed amount. The deal, likely to close by the end of this calendar year, will likely drive the company’s growing snack business. On the other hand, the company is also divesting its low-margin businesses (J.W. Swank and Spicetec Flavors & Seasonings businesses spin-off in July 2016), in a bid to boost its near-term profitability.  These moves are anticipated to drive Conagra’s margin growth by nearly 32% by the end of fiscal 2020.Also, by launching several on-trend products, Conagra has been augmenting its market-demand share. For instance, introduction of the aforementioned PAM Spray Pumps or the latest Power Bowls rolled out under the Healthy Choice (May 2017) will likely fuel Conagra’s aggregate sales, going forward.However, lower volumes, unfavorable price/mix or adverse foreign currency translation impact might continue to weigh over the company’s Grocery & Snacks, Refrigerated & Frozen, and Foodservice, and International segments’ sales in the quarters ahead. Also, we believe price inflation of major raw inputs such as soybeans, pork, oats, beef, poultry, wheat and corn might hurt Conagra’s near-term margins. In addition, intense rivalry in the industry might mar its near-term top- and bottom-line performance as well.4 Stocks to Watch after the Massive Equifax HackCybersecurity stocks spiked on recent news of a data breach affecting 143 million Americans.

In first-quarter fiscal 2018, the company’s earnings came in at 46 cents, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 41 cents.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayConagra believes its ongoing volume strategy, supply-chain productivity and improvement in price mix will continue to widen margins in the quarters ahead. In addition, margin expansion, increased share repurchases, and lower interest expenses as a result of reduced debt burden will drive earnings in the quarter to be reported.We also anticipate that the company’s strategic inorganic moves will enhance its competency in the near term. For instance, buyouts of fast-growing meat snack brands like Duke’s and BIGS (April 2017), as well as Angie's Artisan Treats, LLC acquisition (October 2017) are anticipated to bolster the company’s revenues in the fiscal second quarter. Moreover, the divestiture of J.W. Swank and Spicetec Flavors & Seasonings businesses (July 2016) will prove conducive to the company’s earnings growth.In addition, Conagra’s recently-launched products (such as Power Bowls rolled out in May and the Pam Spray Pumps launched in September) are expected to drive its revenues in the upcoming quarters.However, poor volumes (due to the planned discontinuation of low-performing products and lesser promotional activities) of Grocery & Snacks, Refrigerated & Frozen, Foodservice and International segments might dent Conagra’s top-line performance. Also, increased slotting dues associated with innovation investments might also continue to weigh over the company’s organic sales in the near future.Additionally, Conagra conducts its business in a highly competitive industry. Intense competition might expose the company to risks of market share loss. Furthermore, inflation in prices of major products like proteins, peanuts and packaging will continue to mar the company’s margins.Conagra currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the stock is currently pegged at 52 cents for the quarter under review.  It should be noted that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are some stocks in the same industry that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Flowers Foods, Inc.

294,CAG,"United Natural Foods, Inc. (UNFI  -  Free Report) is slated to release fourth quarter and fiscal 2017 results on Sep 13, after the market closes. This distributor of natural, organic and specialty food and non-food products has delivered positive earnings surprise in two out of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 1.9%.Considering the above, let’s look into some factors that are likely to impact fiscal fourth-quarter results.What Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Our proven model does not show that United Natural is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP for this to happen. You may uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.United Natural has an Earnings ESP of +0.90% as the Most Accurate estimate of 70 cents is pegged higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 69 cents. However, the company carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). We caution against Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.United Natural Foods, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  United Natural Foods, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | United Natural Foods, Inc. QuoteEstimate Revisions A look into estimate revisions give us an idea of what analysts are thinking about the company right before earnings release. Estimates for both fourth quarter and for the fiscal year have remained stable over the past 30 days at 69 cents and $2.54, respectively. Estimated earnings for the fourth quarter depict a decline of 0.9% from the prior-year period. The same for the fiscal year shows a decline of 1.8%.  Moreover, estimated earnings for the fiscal year is at the top end of management’s guidance of $2.49 to $2.54.Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $2.4 billion for the fourth quarter, up approximately 6.9% from prior-year quarter.  Further, revenues for fiscal 2017 are expected to be $9.3 billion, a rise of 9.8% from the previous year.Factors at Play                                                               We note that United Natural’s sales have lagged the estimate for the last 10 quarters. It seems that United Natural has been struggling against tough grocery industry environment, laden with stiff competition, tight margins and aggressive promotions. Traditional grocery companies are facing competition from rival companies, which are strengthening their franchises and are offering alternative outlets for food and other staples. Such industry-wide headwinds are expected to dent the company’s top line and margin, going ahead.In addition to such challenges, United Natural’s excessive reliance on its sole customer, Whole Foods Market, also poses as a formidable threat. The company has a partnership agreement with Whole Foods till 2025. Moreover, Whole Foods has recently been acquired by Amazon.com (AMZN  -  Free Report), and it’s not yet apparent how this deal might impact the business of United Natural in the forthcoming period. In fact, Amazon’s growing strength and expansion strategies in the grocery industry have also affected other companies such as ConAgra Foods Inc. (CAG  -  Free Report) and Kellogg Company (K  -  Free Report).The impact of such ongoing headwinds and the lack of investor’s confidence on the company are clearly visible in its share performance. Shares of United Natural have declined 19.2% in the past six months compared with the Consumer Staples sector’s increase of 4.1%.Although United Natural has been benefitting from acquisitions and restructuring initiatives, the same have not been able to completely offset the disadvantages arising out of the difficult grocery environment.4 Surprising Tech Stocks to Keep an Eye On Tech stocks have been a major force behind the market’s record highs, but picking the best ones to buy can be tough. There’s a simple way to invest in the success of the entire sector. Zacks has just released a Special Report revealing one thing tech companies literally cannot function without.

295,CAG,"Owing to the growing awareness of the nutritional value of food products among consumers, The Kraft Heinz Company (KHC  -  Free Report) is focusing on natural and organic ingredients, reshaping its existing portfolio and foraying into other categories. Through 2017, the company has been focusing on improving in many areas, including soy sauces in Indonesia, cold cuts in United States and baby food in Canada.Also, the importance of using real ingredients and minimal processing in packaged food products is being emphasized on. As a result, a large number of companies in the food industry are switching or have already switched to the use of cage-free eggs. Kraft Heinz, which uses eggs for its line of sauces, plans to switch to 100% cage-free eggs for its North American operations by 2025.Apart from innovation, cost saving has also led to higher profits. The company expects $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion (previously 1.7 billion) of cumulative Integration Program savings by the end of 2017, primarily focused on work-force reduction, factory closures and consolidations. In third-quarter 2017, the company realized cumulative savings of approximately $1.58 billion from its Integration Program.Other productivity improvement initiatives include programs such as zero-based budgeting, modernization and capability building within the manufacturing footprint.Though the company’s sales have been relatively soft, cost savings have led to better margins. While organic sales declined 1.1% in the last nine months of 2017, adjusted EBITDA rose 1.3% and adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 80 basis points year over year. As part of these initiatives, savings are being re-invested in the business for innovation, brand building and marketing to stimulate the top line.ConcernsThe company is seeing top-line weakness over the past several quarters owing to a shift in consumer preference toward natural and organic ingredients. In the first nine months of 2017, reported net sales of $19.36 billion declined 1.4% year over year primarily due to soft consumer demand in the United States, Canada and Europe. Three of the four reporting segments saw year-over-year declines during this period, with Canada seeing the steepest decline of 5.5%. The United States and Europe witnessed a decline of 1.7% and 1.6%, respectively. Organically, sales declined 1.7% in the United States and 6.4% in Canada.Continued softness in sales weighed on the company’s performance, leading to an 8.9% year-to-date decline in the shares. This compares unfavorably with the industry’s fall of 5.5%. Also, the earnings estimates for 2017 and 2018 remained stable over the past 30 days.  Currency fluctuations are a major headwind for Kraft Heinz, with a considerable percentage of its revenues coming from outside the United States. Foreign exchange dented revenue growth by more than 5% in fiscal 2015 and 2.5% in 2016. It also negatively impacted net sales by 0.3% in the first three quarters of 2017.Moreover Kraft Heinz’s fourth-quarter outlook is weak with organic sales likely to face a 30-bps headwind from hurricane-related issues, delayed production line start-ups impacting cold cuts as well as difficult year-over-year comparisons owing to strong fourth-quarter 2016 results. The company anticipates solid EBITDA growth to offset these challenges, reflecting its focus on boosting sales as well as cost savings.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderKraft Heinz carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the industry are Flowers Foods, Inc. (FLO  -  Free Report), The Conagra Brands Inc. (CAG  -  Free Report) and Lamb Weston Holdings Inc. (LW  -  Free Report). All the companies carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

296,CAG,"Moving ahead with its portfolio restructuring strategy for long-term growth, Unilever PLC (UL  -  Free Report) recently announced plans to offload its global Spreads business to KKR (KKR  -  Free Report). Incidentally, the provider of personal care products, which was looking for buyers for its spreads unit, received a binding proposal from KKR to buy the shrinking business. Expected to close in mid-2018, the cash-free and debt-free deal is worth roughly €6.825 billion.Sources revealed that Unilever’s spreads business has been sluggish for a while now due to consumers’ preferences moving from bread and margarine to more natural foods. While Unilever has been taking initiatives to improve the business, management believes that its Spreads business is likely to reach its full potential under KKR’s ownership.In fact, industry experts also believe that funds like these can run such business segments more efficiently, by doing away with underperforming parts and accelerating growth via other game plans. Thus, sale of the Spreads business to KKR is likely to support growth of this segment, given the global investment firm’s robust network and operational excellence.The transaction, which will include sale of brands like Becel, Flora, Blue Band, I Can’t Believe It’s Not Butter and more, remains subject to regulatory approval. Further, Unilever plans to use the cash generated from this deal in making shareholder-friendly moves, or to carry out other buyouts.What Has Been Driving Unilever’s Strategic Moves?Unilever has been focusing on bolstering and enhancing efficiency after the failed $143-billion takeover attempt by Kraft Heinz Co. (KHC  -  Free Report) earlier this year. Since then, the company has undertaken a comprehensive review to return more cash to shareholders and enhance margins to boost performance. In this regard, Unilever had decided to offload its shrinking spreads business in April, when it also announced plans to raise cost-savings target and combine foods and refreshments businesses.Clearly, the aforementioned sale to KKR marks a solid step in achieving these goals. As part of strengthening its portfolio, the company has also remained keen on making strategic buyouts. This is evident from Unilever’s agreement to acquire Brazilian natural and organic food business Mae Terra in October, which complements the company’s efforts to expand in the high-growth natural and organic segment.Apart from natural foods, Unilever is also making aggressive attempts to nourish its beauty and wellness products portfolio. Evidently, the company inked a deal to buy Schmidt’s Naturals last week, which is likely be a valuable inclusion in the company’s Personal Care Business. Prior to that, in November, the company agreed to acquire leading skincare and haircare brand Sundial Brands and cosmetics company Carver Korea in September. Unilever’s robust efforts to reshape its portfolio have been appeasing investors, as reflected by this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock’s impressive past performance. Well, shares of this consumer products giant have surged 40.7% this year, crushing the industry’s rally of 21.3%. We believe that prudent endeavors like the aforementioned sale of the Spreads unit, is likely to drive further growth for Unilever.Looking for More Promising Stocks?

297,CAG,"Progressing with expansion of natural products portfolio, Unilever Plc (UL  -  Free Report) inked a deal to buy Schmidt’s Naturals. Headquartered in Oregon, Schmidt’s specializes in personal care products such as deodorants, toothpaste and bar soaps. Management expects Schmidt’s brands to compliment Unilever’s diverse natural products portfolio and prove to be a valuable inclusion in the company’s Personal Care Business.Schmidt’s commands a strong portfolio of natural brands and has been delivering sturdy growth in the fast-paced natural products industry, courtesy of the company’s dedication toward innovation. In fact, Schmidt’s deodorants are popular for its award-winning formulas, extracted mainly from minerals and plants. While the transaction is likely to benefit Unilever, Schmidt’s products are also expected to gain from wide-spread sales channels in key global markets.The terms of the agreement have been kept discreet by the companies. Further, the contract is expected to close by the end of the first quarter of 2018.Other Acquisitions Driving the Stock  Unilever has been advancing well in the natural and organic products category, gaining from consumers increasing preference for such products. Rising consumer awareness regarding the harmful impacts of toxic chemicals has been driving the market share for organic personal care products. The recent deal with Schmidt’s is thus expected to further strengthen Unilever’s position in this category.Apart from adding natural products brands in the beauty and wellness category, Unilever has also been fortifying organic foods portfolio. Evidently, Unilever entered into an agreement to acquire Brazilian natural and organic food business Mãe Terra in October.Notably, Unilever has been focusing on bolstering and enhancing efficiency after the failed $143-billion takeover attempt by Kraft Heinz Co. (KHC  -  Free Report) earlier this year. Since then, the company has been undertaking several initiatives to improve performance.To this end, this consumer products giant has been on an acquisition spree in the last few months, to bolster foothold in the beauty arena. In November, the company agreed to acquire New York-based Sundial Brands, a leading skincare and haircare brand. It also clinched a deal to buy cosmetics company Carver Korea for 2.27 billion euros in September. Incidentally, the beauty category has been witnessing high growth, on the back of social media content and diverse professional make-up techniques. Investors are optimistic about Unilever’s consistent efforts to tap into prospective business areas and seize opportunities therein. Notably, shares of this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company have surged 39.7% in the past year compared with the industry’s gain of 17.6%.Looking for More?

298,CAG,"Shares of major packaged food companies have been trading lower since June as investors fear that Amazon.com, Inc.’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) $13.7 billion buyout of the organic grocer Whole Foods Market, Inc.  would make a seismic shift for retailers.Shares of a number of grocery store chains, including The Kroger Co. (KR  -  Free Report) and Sprouts Farmers Market Inc. (SFM  -  Free Report), dipped on Aug 28, after the deal officially came into effect. The deal was announced in mid-June. Losses spread across the food sector and shares of The Kraft Heinz Company (KHC  -  Free Report), Post Holdings Inc. (POST  -  Free Report), Kellogg Company (K  -  Free Report), ConAgra Foods Inc. (CAG  -  Free Report) and Treehouse Foods Inc. (THS  -  Free Report) tumbled as well.Traditional packaged food brands such as General Mills, Inc. (GIS  -  Free Report), Kellogg and Conagra are already struggling, as consumers look for fresh foods and more natural brands over packaged and processed food.Kraft Heinz has been witnessing top-line weakness for the past several quarters. Its reported sales of $13.04 billion declined 2.4% year over year in the first six months of 2017 due to soft consumer demand in North America and Canada. For Kellogg, net sales declined 3.3% year over year due to foreign currency headwind and weak volume (down 5.3%) as a result of unexpectedly soft consumption trends across most categories during the period. General Mills' sales too have declined 6.8% in fiscal 2017 and the company’s slowing organic volumes are overshadowing minor improvements in profit margins.That said, these major packaged food companies have been fighting the sales slump with consumer-focused innovation, marketing initiatives and robust restructuring savings.For General Mills, adjusted gross margin advanced 50 basis points or bps and adjusted operating margin increased 130 bps in fiscal 2017. Again, cost savings from its Project K and Zero-Based Budgeting (ZBB) have been supporting renovation, innovation, brand support and margins for Kellogg. Kraft Heinz realized cumulative savings of approximately $1.45 billion from its Integration Program as of second-quarter 2017.Amazon's foray into brick-and-mortar stores is now likely to step up fresh price wars for these companies’ products, both in stores and online. Amazon’s as much as 43% price cut on Whole Foods’ products on its first day as the owner of this organic grocer could be distressing for the entire food industry. Prices of a number of products, ranging from avocados to organic chicken, were cut.Bottom LineDespite traditional packaged food companies taking a number of initiatives to boost sales, the weakness in this area continues. Amid this uproar, how these food biggies deal with the latest Amazon-Whole Foods merger is a wait-and-see story.4 Surprising Tech Stocks to Keep an Eye OnTech stocks have been a major force behind the market’s record highs, but picking the best ones to buy can be tough.

299,CAG,"On Aug 7, we issued an updated research report on premium consumer goods company – Conagra Brands, Inc. (CAG  -  Free Report).  Existing ScenarioConagra believes that its strategy to bring down production volumes, improve pricing conditions, increase supply-chain productivity and divest low margin generating businesses will be conducive to margin growth in the quarters ahead. The company anticipates to drive its margin growth by nearly 32% by the end of fiscal 2020. In addition, factors such as increased share repurchase, margin expansion and lesser interest expense, as a result of reduced debt burden, are expected to boost earnings in the near term. Also, Conagra encourages innovation in business for enhancing its product portfolio. The company is rolling out several on-trend products in the market through advanced innovation processes, in turn capturing higher market demand share. Stronger demand for new products launched under major brands such as Peter Pan, Healthy Choice and Alexia are anticipated to bolster Conagra’s near-term revenues.However, we notice that over the last one month, Conagra’s shares yielded a return of 2.89%, underperforming 3.86% growth recorded by the industry.The company intends to boost its revenues and margins through increased business internationalization. However, international operations expose it to several economic, political and environmental headwinds. In fourth-quarter fiscal 2017, foreign currency translation impact marred Conagra’s revenues by 3.5%. Currency-related headwinds might weigh over the company’s overseas market performance, moving ahead.Additionally, we believe that headwinds such as stiff industry rivalry or input price inflation might limit near-term prospects for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company.Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the stock remained unchanged for fiscal 2018, reflecting neutral market sentiments.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the industry are listed below:Nu Skin Enterprises, Inc.

300,CAG,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Conagra Brands, Inc. (CAG  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 14.5% in that time frame, underperforming the market.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Conagra Posts In-Line Q4 Earnings, Gives FY18 EPS ViewConagra reported in-line earnings for fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 (ended May 31, 2017).In the fiscal fourth quarter, Conagra’s quarterly earnings from continuing operations came in at $0.37 per share, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, the bottom line came in 15.6% higher than the year-ago tally. The company noted that the year-over-year upside was stemmed by lower interest expense, and reduced selling, general and administrative costs.Adjusted earnings from continuing operations in fiscal 2017 came in at $1.74 per share compared to $1.30 per share reported in the year-ago period.Revenues: Conagra generated net revenue of $1,861.7 million in the reported quarter, down 9.3% year over year. However, the top line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,859 million.Revenues for fiscal 2017 came in at $7,826.9 million, down 9.7% year over year. The dismal top-line performance came due to the lower volumes accrued from the company’s initiatives to create an improved quality revenue base.Segmental DetailsGrocery & Snacks: The segment’s quarterly sales were $749.4 million, down 3% year over year.Refrigerated & Frozen: Quarterly revenues declined 5.1% year over year to $640.2 million.International: Sales of the segment came in at $204.7 million, down 1.3% year over year.Foodservice: The segment’s quarterly revenues were $267.4 million, down 5.3% year over year.Margins/Costs: Conagra’s cost of goods sold dropped 9.5% year over year to $1,332.7 million. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses plunged 42.9% year over year to $417.8 million. Interest expenses plummeted 37.6% to $37.5 million due to lower debt levels.Adjusted gross profit expanded 130 basis points (bps) to 29% during the quarter. Adjusted gross margin for fiscal 2017 came in at 30.2%, expanding 180 basis points year over year. The company mentioned that its margins improved on the back of robust supply chain productivity, improved price/mix and divestiture of low-margin businesses.Balance Sheet/Cash Flow: Conagra exited the fiscal fourth quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $251.4 million, lower than $798.1 million recorded at the end of fiscal 2016. In fiscal 2017, Conagra generated net cash of $1,175.5 million from its operating activities, down from $1,259.2 million recorded in the year-ago period. Capital spent on additions of property, plant and equipment totaled $242.1 million, down 12.8% year over year.During the reported quarter, the company repurchased 10 million shares of common stock with an amount of $405 million.Outlook: Conagra anticipates reporting adjusted earnings from continuing operations within the range of $1.84–$1.89 per share for fiscal 2018. The company plans to buyback roughly $1.1 billion worth shares of its common stock in fiscal 2018.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then? Following the release, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates. There have been three revisions lower for the current quarter.Conagra Brands, Inc. Price and Consensus  Conagra Brands, Inc.. Price and Consensus | Conagra Brands, Inc. QuoteVGM ScoresAt this time, Conagra's stock has an average Growth Score of 'C', while it is lagging a lot on the momentum front with 'F'.  The stock was allocated a grade of 'B' on the value side, putting it in the top 40% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of 'C'. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Based on our scores, the stock is more suitable for value investors than those looking for growth.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock. The magnitude of this revision also indicates a downward shift. Interestingly, the stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We are expecting an inline return from the stock in the next few months.

301,CAG,"On Jul 14, 2017, we issued an updated research report on The Hershey Company (HSY  -  Free Report), the leading chocolate manufacturer in North America.Hershey’s shares have outperformed the Zacks categorized Food-Confectionary industry year to date. The company’s shares have gained around 1.3%, while the broader industry declined 10.2%.The company’s strong brand portfolio, focus on innovation and productivity improvements and cost savings programs are encouraging. However, the changing North American food industry raises concern.Cost Saving Plans Combatting Weak SalesThe North American food industry has been witnessing sluggish growth and slowdown in consumption for the last few quarters. The industry is experiencing changes in consumer preference (for example, shift toward products with less artificial sweeteners, sodium and saturated fat), changes in consumer dynamics, demographic shifts, and also a spending shift toward lower-priced products.Given these changes, Hershey, like a number of U.S. food producers namely Mondelez International, Inc. (MDLZ  -  Free Report), ConAgra Foods Inc. (CAG  -  Free Report) and food giant General Mills, Inc. (GIS  -  Free Report), has been facing the brunt of shifting consumer preference.Hershey has been experiencing top-line pressure since 2014. In 2016, the company’s sales experienced a meager 0.7% growth. Meanwhile, the U.S. chocolate category is gradually slowing. In fact, the company is witnessing chocolate category softness in key international markets such as China. The chocolate category sales in China were flat and below the market level in first-quarter 2017.Nevertheless, Hershey regularly brings innovation to its core brands to meet consumer demand and needs that are not addressed by its current portfolio. The company’s initiatives have been bearing fruit of late with net sales increasing 2.8% year over year in the first quarter. This marks the fourth straight rise in quarterly sales after few quarters of no growth.Again, under its continuous improvement and productivity (CIP) program, management has optimized its North American manufacturing footprint, added manufacturing capabilities in international markets, increased supply chain productivity, invested in cost saving projects and improved the sales mix significantly.The productivity and cost savings from these efforts are being invested in brand building and supporting growth and gaining marketplace insights, which in turn are boosting the company’s margins.In the last reported quarter, Hershey’s adjusted gross margin expanded 70 basis points (bps) to 47.5% buoyed by favorable trade, supply chain productivity and costs-savings initiatives and lower input costs, which offset other higher supply chain costs. Operating margin also expanded 170 bps to 23.2%.Additionally, the company unveiled a new cost-savings program, Margin for Growth, to boost profitability. The international division is expected to significantly narrow its operating loss in 2018 on the back of the new cost-reduction program.As part of its Margin for Growth multi-year program, it will reduce its global workforce outside the U.S. by 15%. This multi-year program is intended to improve overall operating margin through supply chain optimization, a streamlined operating model and reduced administrative expenses, with savings primarily being achieved in 2018 and 2019. These moves are anticipated to boost efficiency, leverage global shared services and common processes and increase capacity utilization.These initiatives will enable Hershey to achieve its adjusted operating profit margin target of around 22–23% by 2019. The company will incur pre-tax charges of $375 million to $425 million, and provide benefits between $80 million and $100 million from the layoffs.Hershey holds a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

302,CAG,"On a median year-over-year EPS growth rate basis, the earnings reports so far have been far more robust than just about anyone was expecting. It is still early with just 64 (12.8%) of the results in, but it looks like we could have a double-digit gain on this basis for the quarter. The firms that have already reported are showing a median increase of 10.4% over a year ago. That is certainly not something to become despondent over.
"
303,CAG,"The median for the firms yet to report is almost exactly the same as for those that have already reported, at 10.5%. This is especially true since over one-fifth of the Financials have reported, and none of the Energy firms have done so. Positive surprises are leading disappointments by a very strong ratio of 3.75:1. Every sector but Materials (a 1:1 tie) has seen more positive than negative surprises.  That of course excludes those that have yet to have any firms report. The median surprise is also strong at 3.45%.
"
304,CAG,"The sectors with very strong surprise pictures include Tech, where positive surprises are leading disappointments by 8:1. The median surprise matches that of the overall market at 3.45%. The year-over-year growth in the sector is a very robust 27.3%.
"
305,CAG,"Health Care is also putting in a fine showing in the early going with no disappointments and four positive surprises, a robust median surprise of 5.8% and year-over-year EPS growth of 20.0%.
"
306,CAG,"Consumer Staples are also doing well in the early going with a median surprise of 7.9% on six positive surprises and no disappointments. Growth is clocking in at 12.1%.
"
307,CAG,"Even in the two ""bad"" sectors, Financials and Discretionary, things so far have not been as bad as many had feared. True that median EPS has been sharply negative for both sectors, down 27.9% in the case of the Financials and 10.6% for the Discretionary firms, but they were expected to do much worse. Positive surprises are outpacing disappointments by 2.6:1 with a 5.7% median surprise in the case of Financials, and by 2.7:1 with and 2.3% median surprise in the case of the Discretionary firms.
"
308,CAG,"There are three sectors that have yet to have any firms report yet: Energy, Utilities and Telecom. It is worth noting that they hold gold, silver and bronze for the expectations of the firms yet to report. It seems very possible that when all is said and done the median EPS growth for the S&P 500 will be even higher than the robust 10.4% seen so far.
"
309,CAG,"Keep in mind what the median measures. It is a gauge of what the ""normal"" firm will report in terms of EPS. It is not influenced significantly by extreme data points, and implicitly treats the results from Exxon Mobil (XOM  -  Free Report), General Electric (GE  -  Free Report) and Wal-Mart (WMT  -  Free Report) as being just as important as the results for Murphy Oil (MUR  -  Free Report), Manitowoc (MTW  -  Free Report) and Big Lots (BIG). Changes in shares outstanding, due to buybacks or new issuance also affect the results in this measure, while they do not when measuring total net income.

"
311,CAG,"While the median EPS numbers so far are healthy, the total net income numbers are not. Thus far, the 64 firms that have reported have in total come in with total net income that is 19.5% below what they reported in the first quarter of 2007. However, the results are not uniformly bad, some sectors are bearing the brunt and others are weathering the storm nicely. Overall, 309 (61.8%) of the firms in the S&P 500 are expected to report higher net income than they did a year ago.
"
312,CAG,"The Financials are off to a rocky start, with net income just a little bit more than half the levels of a year ago (-49.2%). Granted this is a big improvement over what those same firms reported for the fourth quarter, but it is still hard to spin it as good news. The total net income for the 20 Financial firms that have already reported is $10.7 billion, well below the $21 billion they reported a year ago, but a nice improvement from the $6.6 billion they reported in the fourth quarter.
"
313,CAG,"The Consumer Discretionary sector has also been slammed, with total net income decline of 18.7%, this decline is roughly in line with the 19.2% decline they posted in the fourth quarter. Not surprisingly, the worst losses in the sector have been taken by the two homebuilders (KB Home (KBH  -  Free Report) and Lennar (LEN  -  Free Report)) that have reported. However, two thirds of the firms in the sector that have reported earned less this year than a year ago, so its not just the homebuilders who are hurting.
"
314,CAG,"The other sector that is showing a year-over-year decline in total net income is the Industrials. This can be entirely laid at the feet of the big miss at GE, which is the elephant of the sector, accounting for almost 20% of the total earnings of the sector last year. However, it appears that the miss had more to do with weakness in its financial unit that its industrial units.
"
315,CAG,"Earnings in the rest of the economy have been very robust so far, with four of the seven sectors with firms reporting showing double-digit gains. Tech is in the lead with a 20.4% gain, followed by Staples with a 17.1% rise in total net income. Health Care and Materials follow with gains of 11.1% and 10.3%, respectively.
"
316,CAG,"When those that are reported are combined with the expectations for those yet to report, overall the total net income for the S&P 500 is expected to decline by 2.0%. This equates to a decline in total net income of $4.6 billion for the quarter. This is roughly in line with the performance in the third quarter of 2007, and a vast improvement over the 22.6% decline in the fourth quarter.
"
317,CAG,"The Energy sector is expected to be the biggest winner by a large margin, with total net income expected to rise by 34.3%. Not a shock given where oil prices are, but not exactly due to easy comps either. All told earnings in the Energy sector should be $9.7 billion higher than a year ago.
"
318,CAG,"Even with the miss at GE, the Industrial sector is expected to have a good quarter overall. The firms yet to report are expected to show a total gain of 21.1%, which would lift the sector into second place in the overall growth standings with a gain of 15.5%. Much of the gain is expected to come from higher exports and from gains in currency translation.
"
319,CAG,"Materials and Tech are also expected to post double-digit gains in net income when all is said and done. While the 11.8% gain expected from Tech is well below what the sector has shown so far, it is not awful in the context of a slowing economy. Here again strong operations overseas should more than offset domestic weakness.

"
321,CAG,"To help gauge the direction of the market, we take note of what analysts are thinking. By tallying their EPS changes, we can determine our revisions ratio. This ratio simply divides the total number of positive estimate revisions by the total number of estimate cuts. Thus, a high ratio is a bullish indicator and a low ratio is bearish. For the S&P 500 as a whole, a number below 0.80 or above 1.25 is generally significant. For individual sectors the distance from 1.0 should be greater for the numbers to be significant.
"
322,CAG,"The revisions ratio remains very weak, with almost than twice as many estimates for 2008 earnings being cut as increased. However, we did see a nice improvement, with the ratio rising to 0.57 from 0.49 a week ago. Still a weak reading but it does appear that the analysts are reacting to the better than expected results posted so far. The overall pace of estimate revisions is starting to pick up. Over the last four weeks there have been 1,666 changes in estimates: 608 up and 1,058 down, up 15.7% from 1440: 473 up and 967 down last week. Look for the number to almost double over the next four or five weeks as the analysts react to the first quarter reports. Only three sectors, Energy, Consumer Staples and Materials are solidly in positive territory. Utilities remained roughly neutral. Health Care moved to the neutral area from negative last week. Five sectors saw more than two cuts for every increase, and three more than a 3:1 ratio.
"
323,CAG,"Staples were in the top spot with a revisions ratio of 2.07 this week. This was largely due to strength at Conagra (CAG  -  Free Report), General Mills (GIS  -  Free Report) and Walgreen (WAG).
"
324,CAG,"In Energy, the general story is: Upstream good, downstream bad. The Exploration and Production firms such as Anadarko (APC), XTO Energy (XTO) and EOG Resources (EOG  -  Free Report) were noteworthy for their strength. The independent refiners like Tesoro (TSO) and Valero (VLO  -  Free Report) bucked the trend and were weak. As angry as people are about prices at the pump, this is strong evidence that it is the price of crude, not huge downstream (refining and marketing) profits that are the heart of the problem.
"
325,CAG,"The Financial sector continues to get slammed with estimate cuts, currently running at more than three times as many as estimate increases. Banks, brokers and insurance companies were all slammed with cuts, and there seemed few places to hide.
"
326,CAG,"However, the sector is not alone. In Tech more than three times as many estimates were chopped than increased. The weakness there is most noticeable among the Semiconductors like Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Intel (INTC) and Micron (MU).

"
328,CAG,"The 2009 revisions story is similar to the 2008 story. The revisions ratio is identical at 0.54, down from 0.49 last week, and 0.50 two weeks ago. Very weak, but showing some signs of improvement. Analysts seem to be suspecting that the period of earnings weakness stemming from the soft economy could last quite a while.
"
329,CAG,"The most strength comes from the commodity sensitive Energy and Materials sectors. The Staples sector also joined the party this week, mostly due to strength at GIS and WAG. Energy leads the parade this week with more than three increases for every cut. The strong firms were very similar to those for 2008, but the downstream firms were not as weak. The strength in the sector was very widespread.
"
330,CAG,"The Telecom sector has awful revisions ratio of 0.09, or eleven cuts for each increase, but that is also partly a function of a very low number of revisions (24 total, 2 up and 22 down). However, every firm in the sector saw more estimate cuts than increases. The revisions picture for the Financial sector is no brighter for 2009 than it is for 2008, coming in at 0.21. Revisions like these will eat away at the robust earnings rebound seen for 2009 (unless 2008 gets cut faster). We do not seem to be getting out of the woods on the Financial sector front.
"
331,CAG,"The total number of revisions for the whole S&P 500 for 2009 is also starting to pick up. There were a total of 1,203 revisions: 422 up and 781 down. This is up 12.7% from 1,067 (349 up and 718 down) last week. As with the 2008 revisions, this number is likely to climb dramatically over the next few weeks. Keep in mind that the numbers for some of the individual sectors are still very light. However, the ratio of firms with rising mean estimates to falling mean estimates is 0.76, somewhat stronger than the revisions ratio, but still very much in negative territory.
"

"
333,CAG,"When making investment decisions, growth should always be looked at in conjunction with how much you are paying for a stock. Thus, it makes sense to look at the total earnings expected for a sector, relative to that sectors total market capitalization. This is basically a variation on looking at the P/E.
"
334,CAG,"The chart below shows the share of total earnings for 2007, 2008 and 2009, as well as the share of total market capitalization for each sector (the final bar shown). Since the S&P 500 is a market cap weighted index, this is the same as its index weight. On the chart below, the difference between the sizes of the first three bars shows if a sector is gaining or losing ""earnings share"". The difference between the final bar and the first three bars shows if the sector is selling for an above or below market P/E. If the final bar is smaller than the other bars, the sector is selling for a below market P/E. However, as opposed to just showing the sector P/Es, it also shows the relative importance of the sectors to the overall index.
"
335,CAG,"Despite their current problems, the Financials are still a very significant influence on the market, accounting for a much larger slice of the earnings in each year than any other sector. Even with all the disasters in the sector, for 2007, the Financials accounted for 22.1% of the total net income for the S&P 500. In 2008, that is currently expected to decline to 19.1% before rebounding to 21.7% in 2009. However, in recent years the sector has accounted for well over a quarter of all earnings. Thus even though the sector is at a substantial discount on P/E basis to the overall market it is still the biggest total market cap sector, at 16.43%.
"
336,CAG,"That may not last for long as the Tech sector is nipping at its heels at 16.03%.  Given the on going massive cuts in estimates, please take the P/E on the Financials with a bag of rock salt. The true earnings are likely to be far lower than current estimates now suggest.
"
337,CAG,"For many years Financials were clearly the dominate factor in the overall market. Based on 2008 earnings, the Financials have a P/E of 12.6x and based on 2009, only 9.5x. However given the pace of estimate cuts in the sector, the true P/E is probably higher since the actual earnings will be significantly lower. Energy has just taken the throne as the cheapest based on 2008 earnings, trading at 11.7x, and 11.7x based on 2009 expectations. If current forecasts come to pass the Financials well regain the title of the cheapest based on 2009 earnings. But keep your eyes on the revisions. Unless the spreading of economic weakness to the rest of the world causes oil prices to plunge (and the recent trends are very much in the other direction), you can have much more confidence in Energy earnings forecasts actually being achieved (or exceeded) than is true with the Financials.
"
338,CAG,"While Energy accounts for only 13.8% of the total market cap of the S&P 500, it was responsible for 15.8% of 2007 earnings and is expected to be the source of 17.1% of 2008 earnings (falling to 15.6% in 2009). This is almost a mirror image of Tech which has a 16.0% weight in the index but was responsible for only 11.7% of 2007 earnings. However, Techs earnings share is expected to rise to 12.8% in 2008 and 12.9% in 2009.
"
339,CAG,"The S&P 500 as a whole is trading for 14.6x and 12.6x, 2008 and 2009 earnings, respectively. Based on a blend of 75% 2008 earnings and 25% 2009 earnings, that translates to a 7.1% earnings yield, which looks extremely cheap relative to a 3.78% ten year T-note. Even against the AA corporate bond yield of 5.95% it looks attractive. However, the current level of expectations for corporate earnings still imply that profits will stay well above their historical averages as a share of GDP. That would be an exceedingly rare occurrence during a recession.  The comparison between the earnings yield on the S&P and the 10 year T-note is in my opinion more a reflection of the extreme unattractiveness of long term T-notes at this point than stocks looking particularly cheap in general, however there are attractive stocks out there. It appears that the flight to quality has caused a massive bubble in the price of T-notes. The prices are hard to justify given the risk that the massive injections of liquidity by the Fed to ameliorate the credit crunch will end up fueling the fires of inflation.

360,CAG,"It is going to be one very busy and volatile week.
"
361,CAG,"The main event is the September Federal Open Market Committee meeting. This is will be a one-day meeting with a statement due out around 2:15 ET. Expectations call for the Fed to cut the federal funds rate by as much as 50 basis points, though I think the cut will be 25 basis points. As important as the size of the rate cut will be, which is not guaranteed to happen, the wording in the statement will matter too. Any language judged to be overly hawkish or that signals the pace of growth is slowing too rapidly will cause some turmoil. Bluntly put, there is a lot of room for error. A ""sell on the news"" reaction to an otherwise favorable rate cut and statement is also not out of the realm of possibilities.
"
362,CAG,"Four of the leading investment banking firms will be reporting fiscal third-quarter results. Lehman Brothers (LEH) is scheduled for Tuesday morning. Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) will report on Wednesday. Bear Stearns (BSC) and Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report) will both report on Thursday. Profit forecasts have been falling for all four firms.
"
363,CAG,"Friday is a triple witching day, meaning stock options, index options and futures contracts will all expire. Combined, these expirations can lead to increased volatility. In addition, Yom Kippur, the Jewish day of atonement, starts that evening. As a result, trading volume could taper in the afternoon and some of Friday's volatility could start on Thursday.
"
364,CAG,"To better convey just how the busy the week is going to be, here is a day by day schedule.
"
365,CAG,"Monday: The New York Fed's Empire State Index will be released in the morning. This is the last piece of ""up-to-the-date"" economic data released before the Fed meeting, though it is a regional survey. Two companies are scheduled to report including S&P 500 member Adobe Systems (ADBE  -  Free Report)
"
366,CAG,"Tuesday: Lehman Brothers will report before the bell and will hold a conference call at 10 a.m. ET. August PPI will be released in the morning, giving the Fed one additional reading on inflation. The FOMC will release its statement around 2:15 (possibly, a few minutes earlier or later). In addition to Lehman, eight companies will report earnings including S&P 500 members AutoZone (AZO  -  Free Report), Best Buy (BBY  -  Free Report), Darden Restaurants (DRI  -  Free Report) and Kroger (KR  -  Free Report)
"
367,CAG,"Wednesday: August CPI, housing starts and building permits will be released in the morning. Morgan Stanley will report as will 13 other companies, including S&P 500 fellow member General Mills (GIS  -  Free Report).
"
368,CAG,"Thursday: Bear Stearns and Goldman Sachs will report before the start of trading. (BSC was the only major brokerage firm to miss second-quarter expectations and profit forecasts have been falling ever since.) The Conference Board's index of leading indicators and weekly initial jobless claims will be published in the morning. In addition to BSC and GS, earnings reports from 15 other companies have been confirmed including S&P 500 members ConAgra Foods (CAG  -  Free Report), Circuit City (CC), FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report), Nike (NKE  -  Free Report) and Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report).
"
369,CAG,"Friday: Stock options, index options and futures contracts all expire. The Philadelphia Fed will release the results of its latest manufacturing survey around lunchtime. One company is confirmed to report. Yom Kippur starts at sundown.
"
370,CAG,"Companies That Could Issue Positive Earnings Surprises during the Week of Sep 17 - 21General Mills recently revealed that it generated ""good sales and earnings per share gains for its fiscal 2008 first quarter"". The company guided for sales growth above its previous forecast of low single-digit growth and for earnings per share of about 81 cents per share. The majority of the covering brokerage analysts raised their forecasts in response, pushing the consensus earnings estimate five cents higher to 81 cents per share. GIS matched fiscal fourth-quarter expectations after previously topping estimates for 10 consecutive quarters. General Mills is scheduled to report on Wednesday, Sep 19, before the start of trading.
"
371,CAG,"Companies That Could Issue Negative Earnings Surprises during the Week of Sep 17 - 21
"
372,CAG,"As I stated previously, forecasts for Bear Stearns have been falling ever since the company missed second-quarter expectations. During the past three months, fiscal third-quarter profit projections have plunged 35% to $2.22 per share. The most accurate estimate is even more bearish at $1.70 per share, reflecting cuts by two brokerage analysts within the past seven days. Bear Stearns is scheduled to report on Thursday, Sep 20, before the start of trading.
"
373,CAG,"Lehman Brothers easily surpassed fiscal second-quarter expectations after coming up a penny shy during the first quarter. Profit forecasts for the fiscal third-quarter have dropped materially over the past 30 days with nine of the 14 covering brokerage analysts lowering their projections (including two within the past week). The current consensus estimate of $1.60 per share is 21 cents below the average forecast of a month ago. The most accurate estimate is more bearish at $1.47 per share. Lehman Brothers is scheduled to report on Tuesday, Sep 18, before the start of trading.
