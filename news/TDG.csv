18,TDG,"President Donald Trump is as risky for the aerospace industry as Hillary Clinton was to drug manufacturers, according to a report Friday from a noted short seller, which also warned on aerospace supplier TransDigm's (TDG).""President Trump has promised to end the long-standing, infuriating tradition of 'sticking the US Government with tab,' "" Citron Research said in a note. ""He has already made lowering prices for military aircraft a pillar of his transition into office.""During his transition, Trump took to Twitter (TWTR) to call out Boeing (BA) and Lockheed Martin (LMT) over high costs for Air Force One and the F-35 program respectively.After meeting with Trump, Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg said the company could build a new Air Force One for under $4 billion.Lockheed CEO Marillyn Hewson said after her meeting with Trump that an upcoming contract for the next batch of F-35 fighters will create thousands of jobs and that the company is near a deal for 90 additional F-35s that will ""significantly"" reduce the costs.Last month, the Pentagon's program office said that costs would likely come down ""6%-7%"" for the 10th batch of fighters.Boeing shares rose 0.3% to 159.53 on the stock market today. Lockheed shares climbed 0.3% to 257.73.But Boeing and Lockheed likely won't be the last aerospace companies that Trump targets. Citron wrote that TransDigm's business model relies too much on raising prices to turn a profit, potentially putting it in Trump's cross hairs in the future.The company ""acquires airplane parts companies (over 50 in total), fires employees, and egregiously raises prices"" just like drugmaker Valeant (VRX), Citron claimed.TransDigm didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.Shares plunged 9.9% to 226.90.TransDigm is a major supplier to Boeing, Lockheed, Northrop Grumman (NOC), Raytheon (RTN) and other aerospace giants.IBD'S TAKE: The littoral combat ship, nuclear missiles and Northrop's B-21 are other defense programs Trump could take aim at next.Despite the perception that Trump would be friendlier to the drug industry than Clinton would have been, Trump has recently accused drugmakers of ""getting away with murder"" on prices and has vowed to lower them.RELATED: Navy: Lockheed F-35 'On A Completely Different Level' Vs.

19,TDG,"Boeing (BA) emphasized the importance of trade with China for aerospace industry jobs in the U.S. as President Donald Trump pushes for more protectionist policies.CEO Dennis Muilenburg said on a conference call Wednesday that a ""healthy trade relationship between the U.S. and China is still important.""China is emerging as a key aerospace market as the country's rising middle class boosts demand for travel. In September, Boeing estimated China would need 6,810 airplanes, valued at $1 trillion, over the next 20 years.To stay competitive Muilenburg said the planned 737 completion plant in Zhoushan is ""an important part of the partnership equation.""""That finishing center is a location where we can add value in China, but every airplane that goes there is built in the U.S.,"" he said. ""It's a great example of how growth in China creates growth in U.S. manufacturing jobs.""Muilenburg was bullish on Trump's focus on the American workforce and tax reforms and regulations for the aerospace sector, but Citron Research warned earlier this month that Trump is a big threat to the industry as he looks to lower military aircraft costs.But strong Q4 results sent Boeing shares up 4.2% to 167.36, hitting record highs on the stock market today, continuing to break out after just clearing a 160.17 buy point on Monday. European rival Airbus (EADSY) fell 0.8%.Adjusted Q4 earnings jumped 54% to $2.47 a share, marking its fastest growth in more than three years, as revenue dipped 1% to $23.29 billion, better than forecasts for $23.19 billion.Commercial aircraft revenue rose 1% to $16.24 billion, as Q4 deliveries edged up 1.6% to 185. Defense, space and security revenue fell 12% to $6.86 billion. Total backlog was $473 billion at the end of Q4, up from $462 billion at the beginning of Q4.Full-year 2017 EPS of $9.10-$9.30, below Wall Street views for $9.31, on revenue of $90.5 billion-$92.5 billion, below consensus views for $93.09 billion. Operating cash flow is seen increasing to $10.75 billion next year from $10.5 billion in 2016, as the 787 program has finally turned cash-flow positive, boosting prospects for more stock buybacks and dividend hikes.Boeing's commercial division has been pressured by Airbus in recent years and its hot-selling A321neo. Boeing plans to roll out a stretched version of the latest 737 Max to hold on to market share before launching a new fell 0.6%.Boeing's 737 Max 10X plane will carry 190-230 people and could launch in 2020, according to reports earlier this month. Management said in October that the new midsize plane could be delivered by 2024-2025.On the defense side, Boeing had come under fire from Trump over the high costs of its Air Force One replacement program. But Muilenburg met with Trump and said the company could build a new Air Force One for under $4 billion.But Trump also tweeted last month that he asked Boeing to price out a F/A-18 Super Hornet ""comparable"" to the F-35. But Pentagon officials said they need the new Lockheed Martin (LMT) F-35 for stealth and other fifth-generation capabilities that the Super Hornet lacks.Shares of Lockheed, which reported Q4 results above analyst views on Tuesday but gave weak 2017 EPS guidance, dipped 1.1% Wednesday.Also Wednesday, Textron (TXT) said Q4 earnings fell 3.7% to 78 cents per share, falling short of views 87 cents. Revenue was down 2.5% to $3.83 billion, under views for $3.9 billion. Textron also said it agreed to buy Arctic Cat (ACAT) for $247 million, or $18.50 per Arctic Cat share, a 41% premium on Tuesday's closing price. The deal also includes an unspecified amount of debt.  Arctic Cat will keep its brand and become part of Textron's specialized vehicles business.

32,TDG,"Boeing (BA) said Wednesday there's a ""realistic possibility"" it will launch a new midsize plane and a longer version of its 737 Max, as the aerospace giant seeks to counter gains from Airbus' (EADSY) A321neo.Management said on a conference call that a new mid-market plane could be delivered in the 2024-2025 timeframe, while a stretched 737 Max could be ready by the end of the decade.Boeing has been mulling a new midsize plane or a longer 737 to fill the gap created by 757 production stopped, but hasn't said before it would do both. The latest comments come as the company has had to lay off employees due in part to Airbus gaining market share, as the A321neo has helped airlines open up new routes.Boeing also said the production rate on the current-generation 777 likely won't go down by more than 1-2 planes a month, adding that it would take ""offsetting actions"" to limit the impact on margins of any further rate cuts.Sales of the 777 have been slowing as customers prefer to wait for the upcoming next-generation 777X, but the company is trying to maintain a certain level of current-generation 777 production to ensure a smooth transition to the 777X on its assembly lines.Boeing shares jumped 4.7% to close at 145.54 on the stock market today, clearing a 139.55 buy point from a flat base and hitting the highest level of the year.

33,TDG,"IBD's TAKE: Foreign commercial sales are key to keeping the 777 line in production, but the aerospace giant is also chasing foreign military sales as looks to score a major fighter jet deal with India. Boeing's core Q3 EPS rose 11.5% to $2.81, excluding a 70-cent per-share tax benefit, above views for $2.60. Revenue fell 8% to $23.9 billion but topped forecasts for $23.64 billion. Revenue from its commercial airplanes division fell 4% to $16.97 billion on lower planned delivery volume. Boeing preannounced a 5.5% decline in commercial deliveries. Defense revenue fell 10% to $7.5 billion on fewer C-17 deliveries and lower F-15 volume.During the quarter, the Air Force signed two contracts with Boeing for a total value of $2.8 billion to make 19 KC-46 tankers. Boeing had taken a charge on the tanker in the last two quarters amid repeated delays and cost overruns.Boeing now plans to deliver 745 to 750 commercial airplanes this year, up from its prior outlook of 740 to 745 planes. It also raised its full-year EPS outlook to $6.80-$7 from an earlier outlook of $6.10-$6.30, but that just adds the 70-cent per-share tax benefit. Analysts see $6.34.Boeing's European rival Airbus reported a 21% drop in quarterly earnings Wednesday, falling short of analyst views due to supplier issues with its A350. Airbus's U.S.-traded shares climbed 3.4% to 15.02.But the company said problems with engines that it uses from United Technologies' (UTX) Pratt & Whitney are ""largely over."" United Tech shares dipped 0.4% to 101.01.""For the remaining months of the year we remain totally focused on deliveries to achieve our earnings and cash guidance,"" CEO Tom Enders said in a release.Airbus said it would deliver over 208 planes by the end of the year, and deliveries of the A350 will nearly double.At its helicopter unit, Airbus saw a slowdown in commercial sales.In a positive day for defense contractors, Northrop Grumman (NOC) broke out of a flat base, gapping above the 224.22 buy point.

Meanwhile, Tesla's 50-day moving average has crossed back below the slower-moving 200-day moving average, a bearish sign.Tesla is still forecast to report its first profit in eight quarters when it releases third-quarter results, likely in early November. The Street on consensus expects earnings of 7 cents a share, but the range of estimates of 15 analysts tracked by Thomson Reuters varies widely, from a net loss of 46 cents to a net profit of 60 cents.On the upside, Nordstrom (JWN) defied the skeptics of mall-based retail selling, rallying more than 1% to 54.58 for a fourth straight gain.The stock is still more than 30% below an all-time high of 77.65, yet it's certainly on the verge of snuffing out a shorter-term downtrend. Notice how the stock has traded relatively tightly for six weeks, forming a long handle on a long, deep cup base. While the stock is still nearly 22% below a 52-week high near 70, aggressive traders could consider an entry point at 53.81, 10 cents above the long handle that recently formed.Nordstrom is likely gaining ground on upbeat earnings guidance for the third quarter from clothing rival Gap (GPS). Gap stores tend to be in the same mall locations that are anchored by large department store operators such as Nordstrom and Macy's (M).Gap gapped up in price, rising more than 14% to 26.17 in whale-like volume to jump back on the north side of its 50- and 200-day lines. It too is trying to fashion a bottoming-style base pattern since hitting a multiyear peak of 46.85 back in September 2014.RELATED:What Is A Bottoming Base?

43,TDG,"Boeing (BA) said Wednesday the aircraft market remains strong, but its 2016 forecast for fewer deliveries and weak earnings stoked fears that demand may be slowing down after airlines splurged earlier on new planes.The aerospace giant sees 2016 core earnings per share of $8.15-$8.35, well below the $9.43 analysts expect. The company sees revenue of $93 billion-$95 billion, below views for $97.2 billion. Commercial aircraft deliveries are seen at 740-745, down from 762 last year.But management said on a conference call that it continues to see passenger growth outpacing economic growth, adding that 60% of the market for new aircraft are still aimed at fleet expansion and 40% for replacements.""All of that is telling us continuing to ramp up production to keep supply and demand in balance is the right thing to do,"" Boeing said. ""We make decisions with a long-term perspective.""The company will boost 737 production to 57 a month in 2019 vs. 42 a month now and up from previously announced increases to 47 in 2017 and 52 in 2018. As expected, output on the 777 will slow to seven a month, ahead of the 777X's production start.Boeing shares closed down 8.9% in the stock market today, falling intraday to the lowest since late 2013. Rival Airbus (EADSY) fell 4.3%. Aerospace suppliers also sold off. Spirit AeroSystems (SPR) lost 7.8%, B/E Aerospace (BEAV) 1.7%, and TransDigm (TDG) 1.9%.The plunge in oil prices has made it more economical for airlines to fly older, less efficient planes.

Like other military planes, the KC-46 program is behind schedule. The plane made its first test flight in September. The test was originally set for 2014.Boeing took a $536 million after-tax charge in Q2 on the plane due to higher estimated engineering and manufacturing costs.

After a failed breakout, Broadcom (AVGO) slipped 0.7% as it works on a shallow, cup-shaped base with a 166.10 entry. Inphi (IPHI), meanwhile, gave up 1%. It's trading near a double-bottom buy point of 33.69.Elsewhere, TransDigm Group (TDG) bucked the trend, rising 0.5%.

"
46,TDG,"Nothing taxes the soul like having to wait. The test can be double to an investor, for whom waiting can also risk missing a breakout and gaining entry to a winning run.So God invented handles.In stock charts, handles occur most commonly at the end of cup bases. They form less often on double-bottom and flat bases. But in nearly all cases, they offer an earlier entry into a rising stock.No matter the type of base, a handle must be at least five days long. Start counting on the first down day. Mark the buy point a dime above the highest intraday high etched along the handle structure. Note: This high mark sometimes appears on a day before the five-day handle count begins.In a cup base, the midpoint between the handle's highest and lowest price points must be higher than the midpoint between the highest and lowest points marking the left side of the cup. Handles that fail this test may still be usable, but carry added risk.A handle should also form above a stock's 10-week moving average. In the best handles, the price lows drift lower in declining volume. Upward wedging handles along the lows signal the weak underlying shareholders have not yet been shaken out, and the stock's supply-vs.-demand profile may not be ready for a market-leading run.Handles aren't perfect formations. It's good to keep in mind that if we look back over the past few years, the performance of some highly rated stocks that formed handles on flat and double-bottom bases was not stellar.The reason may have more to do with the fact that a stock had already made many bases. Plus, the bulk of recent double-bottom-with-handle breakouts occurred at or near market tops, or in stocks with further consolidating to do before breaking out into winning runs.A great stock will set up a new base. Take Apple (AAPL), which cleared a 208.10 buy point in a flat base with handle in December 2009 (see the accompanying chart). It immediately pulled back more than 8%. But it then formed a six-week cup and continued to carve its multiyear advance.TransDigm Group (TDG) topped a handle buy point of 108 in a seven-week flat base on April 12, 2012. The handle formed low in the base, and the breakout occurred in soft trade. But investors who bought at the handle buy point were rewarded, as the stock gained 31% by last month. (Check out MarketSmith, now part of IBD, to see TransDigm's historical charts.)Another example: Martin Marietta Materials (MLM), which cleared a flat base with handle at 90.52 on Nov. 29, 2012.Handles on some double-bottom bases have shown more dubious results. Bucyrus International staged a weak but ultimately successful breakout from a double-bottom-with-handle base in October 2007, before it was acquired by Caterpillar (CAT).MEMC Materials cleared a double bottom with handle in late October 2007. It rose briefly before slipping into a multiyear decline.Natural gas producer XTO (acquired by Exxon Mobil (XOM) in 2010) cleared a double-bottom-with-handle base in so-so trade in July 2006. The stock soon slipped into another base, which could have been read also as a double bottom with handle. XTO eventually mounted a 104% advance from its original double-bottom-with-handle buy point.(Editor's Note: This column originally published in the Feb. 6, 2013, edition of IBD. MEMC Materials acquired SunEdison in 2009 and changed its corporate name to the latter, but filed for bankruptcy in April 2016.)

47,TDG,"The IBD 50 had a bullish week, erasing losses early in the week to close more than 3% higher and at week's highs.To achieve that, the IBD 50 benefited from outstanding performance from several components.Thor Industries (THO) was one of last week's strongest winners. The RV manufacturer soared on news Friday that it is acquiring Jayco, a maker of travel trailers, high-end motor homes and other types of recreational vehicles that had $1.5 billion in sales last year.The $576 million deal give Thor new types of RVs to its lineup, including Jay Flight, the nation's top selling travel trailer. Jayco will operate as a subsidiary of Thor and its management team will remain in charge.Thor hit a record high Friday. Shares have been volatile and started the week more than 8% from a 63.09 buy point. That triggered a sell signal for investors who bought at that level, but the stock rebounded quickly and closed the week extended from the buy area.Among other noteworthy moves in the IBD 50:Antero Midstream Partners (AM) is in buy range from a 27.48 buy point. The stock topped that entry Thursday. The stock has gone through many periods of volatility since it went public in November 2014. But the most recent base had a calmer profile and evidence of institutional buying.Antero operates pipelines and other plants in the Appalachian Basin to service the production of Antero Resources (AR), which set up Antero Midstream as a limited partnership.NetEase (NTES) is in buy range after breaking out Wednesday. The provider of online games and other internet services in China has seen its earnings performance improve sharply the past few quarters.A report from Daiwa Capital Markets last month cited a strong pipeline of online games and a potential hit in Overwatch, a game licensed from Activision Blizzard.Pool Corp. (POOL) broke out Friday, moving past a 94.69 buy point. Volume grew 11% above its 50-day average, which is good but not great. Watch to see if volume continues to expand. Pool broke out in mediocre volume March 18 and still went on to advance as much as 12%.The company -- the world's largest wholesale distributor of swimming pool products -- got off to a good start this year with warmer weather in most seasonal markets sparking an earlier-than-normal start to the pool season.TransDigm (TDG) is finding support at the 50-day moving average. The aerospace components maker had a successful breakout May 10 on strong earnings, and is now in a follow-on buy area. The company's earnings were mainly in the single digits and low teens in 2013 and 2015, but ramped up 26% to 36% the past three quarters. Sales growth also has trended higher.

Here's a look at four top-rated stocks that are nearing buy points: Avago Technologies (AVGO), Macom Technology (MTSI), Epam Systems (EPAM) and TransDigm Group (TDG).Apple (AAPL) chip supplier Avago Technologies popped more than 9% Thursday after issuing its quarterly report late Wednesday. The results spurred a flurry of price-target hikes from analysts.Avago has an IBD Composite Rating of 98 out of 99.Shares are now about 3% below a 150.60 buy point from a six-month-long consolidation pattern.Fellow chipmaker Macom Technology is trading 4% below a 38.69 buy point from a sloppy cup-with-handle base. Macom came very close to the pivot in Thursday's session, but lost its steam.Last month, Macom reported earnings that grew 26%, in line with expectations. Macom has a 93 Composite Rating.Epam Systems is trading 2% below an 82.05 buy point from a consolidation base.The IT outsourcer dropped hard on its third-quarter sales miss last month, but the stock has recovered relatively quickly. Epam has a highest-possible Composite Rating of 99.Finally, TransDigm Group is working on a flat base with a 245 buy point.

56,TDG,"A smart rally in the morning faded in the afternoon as the major indexes finished mixed.The Nasdaq held onto a gain, closing up 0.3%. The S&P 500 gave up 0.1%, and the Dow Jones industrial average sank 0.5%. The Russell 2000 index of small-cap stocks outperformed with a 0.4% gain. Volume was higher than Friday's holiday-lightened pace on both main exchanges, according to preliminary figures in the stock market today.TransDigm (TDG) gapped up and closed nearly 3% higher. It's now extended from its May 10 breakout. The company joins the S&P 500 after the close June 2.The fading rally led to a number of negative reversals of stocks that made promising advances in the morning. One was Acuity Brands (AYI), which broke out of a flat base after the open. It finished up 1%, but couldn't hold above a 260.93 buy point. Volume was tracking above average in the morning, but finished barely average.How does Acuity Brands stack up to other leading stocks?Gold miners were among the strongest industry groups, up about 3%, although gold was up only modestly. Biotechs were also strong.Retail stocks, banks and department stores were among the poorest performers on the day.

57,TDG,"Stock indexes chalked up losses Tuesday afternoon as the Nasdaq joined the S&P 500 on the loss side.Heading into the final hour of trade, the Nasdaq was down 0.2% after being up 0.4%, while the S&P dropped 0.5%. The Dow Jones industrial average trudged lower, losing 0.8%.Volume in the stock market today was running higher on both major exchanges. Friday's preholiday pace made for an easy comparison.Panera Bread (PNRA) cleared a 219.48 buy point in a shallow, cup-with-handle pattern and then fell back under the entry. Volume was weak. The pattern could be seen as a base atop a base. Panera broke out March 1 in soft volume and then rose 6% from a 208.10 buy point before beginning the current consolidation. The stock never fell more than 3% under the buy point, so individual investors who held their position could be up about 5% now.The fast-casual restaurant-cafe-bakery chain has some things going for it and some things going against it.On the negative side, pretax margin was 9.5% last year, the lowest in seven years. Revenue growth was 6% the past two years, down from double digits in 2010-13. Another drawback is the restaurant stock group.

70,TDG,"One area where Twitter (TWTR) dominates in social media today is discussion of what's happening on television. But Facebook (FB) could overtake Twitter over the next few years in social TV, research firm TDG says.Twitter is now the place where people go to comment on and critique what they see on TV. Whether it's to react to a live sports play or an OMG moment on a favorite drama, connected people turn to Twitter first.In a new report, TDG analyst Alan Wolk predicts that Facebook soon will surpass Twitter as the chosen medium for social TV activity.More than half (55%) of adult social network users chat with their friends about TV shows at least a couple of times per year, while 35% do so at least monthly and about 19% at least weekly, TDG said.Social TV interactions to date have been primarily fan-driven, but they will increasingly take a back seat to interactions around paid placements made by the TV networks, Wolk said.Facebook will be the primary beneficiary of the shift because it has a much larger user base than other platforms and is the only one with census-level user numbers, he said.""This will spur TV networks to put a majority of their social media dollars into Facebook, which has five times the user base and a much wider demographic reach than Twitter,"" Wolk said in a statement.Another factor that will drive the shift is consumers spending less time viewing live TV broadcasts, he said. As consumers move to time-shifted viewing, those engaged in social TV conversations will be less likely to require real-time interaction, where Twitter excels.TDG predicts that the time users spend on Twitter will decline by 31% between 2015 and 2025, taking on a less important role, Wolk said. By comparison, Facebook use will grow 36% over the same time period. And Snapchat use will rise 33%, TDG predicted.

98,TDG,"Net neutrality rules could throw a wrench into Verizon's plans to launch a mobile video-streaming service. Analysts expect Verizon Communications (VZ) to join Dish Network, Sony and Apple in launching online video-streaming services. Verizon, which could launch its service as early as June, aims to set itself apart by focusing its service on wireless phone users.But in the meantime, Verizon is battling the Federal Communications Commission over new Internet rules. Verizon CEO Lowell McAdam last week asked Congress in a letter to rewrite the 1996 Telecommunications Act to address net neutrality rules, which ban Internet service providers from blocking or unfairly slowing down any Web traffic.The FCC in February voted 3 to 2 along party lines for net neutrality rules, for the first time extending those rules to wireless networks. The revised rules don't directly ban plans such as T-Mobile's (TMUS) Music Freedom, a plan offering subscribers unlimited music streaming without it counting toward their data caps.That's where Verizon's planned mobile video-streaming service comes in. For Verizon, one potential issue is that wireless customers have data caps that limit how much video, music and other content they can download. If subscribers go over data caps, bills quickly mount.'Provocative Move' By VerizonWhen it launches a mobile video service, Verizon could skirt the data cap issue by exempting some or all of customer OTT usage from data caps. But it's unclear if that tactic would run afoul of net neutrality rules.""I think that would be a very provocative move,"" said Craig Moffett, an analyst at MoffettNathanson. ""I don't think the FCC would be pleased.""Internet video services target young adults and other consumers who ""cut the cord,"" people who disconnect from pay-TV service in favor of more affordable video content via the Internet. Web-based services generally offer fewer channels at a lower cost than traditional pay-TV services.Apple (AAPL) reportedly aims to offer about 25 TV channels for $30 to $40 per month. Sony (SNE) and satellite TV broadcaster Dish Network (DISH) recently launched their Vue and Sling video services, respectively.The services are dubbed over the top, or OTT, because they piggyback on landline broadband services sold by other companies. Even if consumers don't buy a traditional pay-TV package, they still need broadband Internet service to stream video.What makes Verizon different is that unlike Apple, Dish or Sony, it operates its own nationwide 4G wireless network. Verizon aims to offer a mobile video service that whisks live TV, original shows and pay-per-view to consumers. While many consumers watch TV in homes, analysts say that Verizon's wireless network would let them watch live sports, breaking news or a favorite show on the go.Verizon CFO Fran Shammo recently said that the company might rely on advertising for revenue, not a subscription model like the other OTT services.Verizon hasn't laid out how an add-on mobile video service would impact data consumption.T-Mobile US last year rolled out Music Freedom. One factor working in favor of Music Freedom's not conflicting with net neutrality, analysts say, is that it doesn't compete directly with music services such as Spotify or Pandora (P).AT&T; (T), meanwhile, has been pushing a sponsored-data business model, where data charges are billed to a sponsoring company and not to AT&T; customers, who basically use an app for free. The FCC's new net neutrality rules appear to allow AT&T;'s sponsored-data initiative, analysts say.Telecom firms object to the FCC's net neutrality ruling, saying that it's unnecessary and will stifle investment and innovation. The FCC revised its net neutrality rules after a Washington, D.C., Court of Appeals ruling in January 2014 gutted much of the agency's authority, in reaction to a Verizon suit challenging the FCC's legal basis to impose Internet regulation.A trade group backed by Verizon and AT&T; already has sued the FCC over its new net neutrality rules.Verizon says that it's premature to discuss its mobile video strategy.""It's too soon to provide specifics about a product that hasn't been launched,"" company spokesman Robert Varettoni said.Video Can Get Costly FastVerizon Wireless has nearly 103 million postpaid customers — those billed monthly, including some 86 million smartphone subscribers, as well as tablet users. Verizon also sells FiOS TV and video services via a landline fiber-optic network.The company is a serious contender in the OTT market, says Alan Wolk, an analyst at TDG Research.""Verizon has the potential to be disruptive because whatever play they have will be aimed at their 100 million-plus customers who are all over the U.S. and who are outside its FiOS territory,"" Wolk said.But a streaming service could be ""crazy expensive, given bandwidth caps,"" he said. ""Unless they (Verizon) start selling unlimited LTE plans, all that video gets very, very costly.""Like Apple, Verizon is in talks with content companies. Media companies have been leery of undermining their business relationships with pay-TV distributors like Comcast (CMCSA), which pay programming fees. Cable TV companies have pushed a new ""TV anywhere"" model that requires consumers to log in as pay-TV customers to view programs using an Internet connection. Content companies, though, have struck deals with Dish, Sony and Apple, and would be expected to sign up with any Verizon mobile video service.Content firms want more ad revenue. Nielsen and other market trackers are working on new tools to measure mobile viewing, whether via in-home or public Wi-Fi, or out-of-home cellular networks.Verizon has been developing a spectrum-efficient LTE multicast technology. With multicast technology, Verizon plans to send the same TV signal to thousands of smartphone users in the same area. Sending on-demand video to individuals, in contrast, gobbles up a lot of network bandwidth.For now, the economics of mobile video remain unclear, says Brian Wieser, an analyst at Pivotal Research Group.""The vast majority of TV viewing is going to be on a conventional TV set and in the home,"" he said. ""Delivery of video content over a wireless network would not be exactly the most cost-effective approach. There may be subscribers willing to pay for the incremental service, but whether it's enough to justify the costs that Verizon might incur in launching and operating the service is another matter.""

Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters are expecting Precision Castparts to post a 13.5% jump in Q4 earnings to $3.20 per share. However, that growth rate would be the lowest in four quarters. Revenue is expected to rise 3.5% to $2.52 billion, which would be the company's slowest growth since 2010.In Q3, sales rose 15% to $2. 36 billion but fell below expectations for $3.04 billion.Sales for commercial aircraft are on the uptick as Boeing and Airbus have ramped up production of their new fuel-efficient planes and airlines look to replace their aging fleets amid increasing air traffic. Fuel accounts for one-third of carriers' expenses, so the companies have been investing in more fuel efficiency.In March, Precision Castparts announced it was buying Aerospace Dynamics International for $625 million.

149,TDG,"How To Profit From MAKING MONEY: First In A SeriesIBD's Making Money section offers plenty of tools and articles to help make readers even better investors — fast.One key feature is the NYSE + Nasdaq Stocks On The Move table except for Mondays. On Mondays, you can also find a weekly version of the NYSE + Nasdaq Stocks On The Move. The table also appears on the home page of Investors.com and is updated throughout the trading session.Unlike other ""most active"" tables showing stocks that simply traded the most number of shares during a single session, Stocks On The Move gives you actionable information. In a nutshell, it'll tell you what's being bought and sold by institutions in dramatic fashion.Stocks On The Move can point you to leading stocks breaking out of base patterns or those clearing secondary buy points. These tables also help you identify high-quality names that are forming their bases or are getting ready to break out.Investors can use the feature not only to find watch-list candidates; it can also be used to gauge the market environment. In a healthy market, you should see many leaders rising in big volume. A number of leaders falling in above-average volume can be a bad sign for the market.What makes Stocks On The Move different is that it highlights stocks that had the greatest percentage changes in volume compared with their daily average over the past 50 trading sessions.To make it on the list, stocks must be priced $20 or higher for the NYSE and $16 or higher for the Nasdaq. Stocks must have a price change of at least plus or minus 50 cents. And a stock's 50-day average volume must be above 60,000 shares.The criteria for stocks rising in price get more restrictive. They must have Earnings Per Share and Relative Price Strength Ratings of at least 70 and their Accumulation/Distribution Ratings must be D+ or higher. Lastly, a stock's next year's EPS estimate must be 15% or higher than its prior year's earnings.Stocks with EPS and RS Ratings of 80 or higher as well as being up in price for the day are boldfaced. The reason: so you can quickly identify the market's best stocks.Look at the volume percentage change figure column on the far right. The higher the volume percentage change, the better. Turnover is vital when a stock breaks out. The more volume, the higher the conviction. Each day, look at the stocks with the biggest percentage changes and see if they cleared bases or other buy points.TransDigm (TDG), a maker of aerospace parts, appeared at the top of the Stocks On The Move table in the Jan. 24 edition of IBD. On Jan. 23, the stock blew past a 99.53 buy point 1 from a cup with handle in volume that surged 164% above average (weekly chart is shown). It has gone on to rise 22%.

239,TDG,"Aircraft component maker TransDigm Group (TDG) isn't known for paying dividends to shareholders, but it's now making a big exception.The Cleveland-based firm announced Monday that its board of directors approved a special dividend of $12.85 a share. TransDigm will pay the dividend Nov. 5 to shareholders of record Oct. 25.Investors who want the outsized payout will need to buy the stock before the ex-dividend date, which is generally two business days before the record date.TransDigm's special dividend gives its stock a yield of 8.6%, the biggest in the Aerospace/Defense group. Group members  Boeing (BA), General Dynamics (GD) and Northrop Grumman (NOC) have yields of 2.4% to 3.1%. All three pay regular quarterly dividends.Companies tend to pay dividends from its earnings, but TransDigm will use funds from a recent note offering by its one of its subsidiaries, existing cash on hand and money from a term loan to cover the large payout to shareholders.""With the senior subordinated notes offering, incremental term loan of $150 million and the $12.85 per share special cash dividend, we believe we will have put in place a more efficient capital structure,"" said CEO Nicholas Howley in a press release.TransDigm lost money back in 2003, but has delivered higher profits each year since. It has a three-year stability factor of 10, indicating a steady stream of income.In its latest four quarters, earnings grew 42% to 72%. Sales growth ranged from 39% to 54% over the same period. TransDigm's profit and revenue gains are well above the minimum 25% increases for leading stocks.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters see earnings jumping 50% to $6.71 a share for its fiscal 2012, up from 34% growth in fiscal 2011. The company raised guidance for full-year profit and sales in August.TransDigm has been in a sharp uptrend for years. Despite recent increasing market volatility, the stock is just shy of an all-time high and extended after clearing a 136.44 buy point from a flat base in August.In another sign of strength, the stock's Relative Strength line has hit an new high ahead of price.
"
240,TDG,"Great things come in small packages.At the very least, that's the thinking behind every mini chart of stocks that make up the IBD 50.You can't know everything about a stock before making that proverbial plunge and clicking ""Buy."" The chance to buy a great stock at the right price could vanish if you scrutinize it too long.To focus on the right data, consider the information that goes into every IBD 50 chart, published in IBD every Monday and Wednesday.Next to the company's name is the stock's industry ranking among 197 groups tracked every day by IBD. Don't forget: Up to half of a big winner's move stems from the strength of its industry group and broader sector.Let's focus on the second line of data in the mini chart. The first number shows the stock's float, or shares freely traded. Generally, the smaller the float, the smaller supply of readily available shares. A stock with heavy demand and low supply can soar.The next three pieces of data (Composite, EPS and RS) are all crucial — but in what way? The Composite and EPS scores tell you if a stock is truly superior in profit growth over a three- to five-year span. Combined with the RS, they indicate a stock's ability to outperform the market.So, if you're happy with a market that rises 15% for the year, fine. Buy an index ETF and hope for the best. But a strong Composite and RS Rating can pinpoint stocks with the potential to rise 150%, often in less than a year.Return on equity is valuable. But go beyond just the requirement of 17% ROE or better (as highlighted in past Investor's Corner columns). Why?Often, the biggest market winners have ROE of 30% to 40% or higher. They simply make more money with less.Let's look at Monday's edition of the IBD 50. Questcor Pharmaceuticals (QCOR), TransDigm (TDG) and Lululemon (LULU) show an ROE higher than 30%. They've been rewarded by the market with big price runs.Look below the two lines of text that describe what a company does. Check the second line of extra fundamental data, ""Last Qtr EPS,"" ""Prior Qtr"" and ""Last Qtr Sales."" At a glance, you know what the company is doing in the here and now. If EPS growth is accelerating — a key trait among huge winners — then you'll see a black triangle pointing up. Circle those stocks for further study.In the line below, see how many quarters in a row the company has posted EPS growth of more than 15%. When Lululemon was No. 20 in the then-IBD 100 on Oct. 4, 2010, it sported four quarters of greater than 15% EPS growth. The stock had just broken out of a double bottom at 43.47. It raced up 96% by February 2011.

269,TDG,"Aircraft parts maker TransDigm (TDG) is near a buy point after breaking out of a flat base last week.Volume on this week's mild retreat has been light, a good sign.The stock topped the 136.44 buy point Friday in strong volume, rising as much as 2% to a new high.The base shows one big flaw: a 7% plunge in huge turnover July 24 as the stock crashed through its 50-day line. The drop came after rival BE Aerospace (BEAV) issued a weak full-year outlook.But TransDigm quickly recovered, and on Aug. 7 posted a better-than-expected quarterly earnings report. It then went on an eight-day run, clearing the buy point. TransDigm remains well above its 50-day line.The stock has a 97 Composite Rating and a best-possible 99 Earnings Per Share Rating, putting it at the top of the 56- company Aerospace-Defense industry group. However, the group was ranked just 90 out of 197 as of Wednesday, and the aerospace sector was ranked 25th out of 33.TransDigm's profit growth has ranged from 38% to 72% over the past five quarters. Sales growth has also been strong, ranging from 39% to 54% in that period.TransDigm makes a wide range of parts for civilian and military customers. Most of its sales come from products for which TransDigm is the sole supplier. The resulting pricing power may help explain its strong annual pretax margin and return on equity.Orders for new commercial jets have increased as airlines seek more-fuel-efficient planes. That also is helping TransDigm.However, the company has racked up huge debts as part of its strategy of growth through acquisitions.About 25% of TransDigm's revenue is tied to the defense industry, which could become a victim of government budget cuts.

270,TDG,"As you search for winning stocks, don't forget to check out their long-term debt levels.IBD doesn't give a specific debt-to-equity level that means danger. Just keep in mind that lower is better and some other key points that we'll review here.Lower debt levels are better for a simple reason: They're more manageable. A highly leveraged company might end up earning too little to meet its debt obligations due more than one year away, leading to losses and even potential bankruptcy.Remember that you'll see different ratios that can explain a company's debt. You might see a cash flow-to-debt ratio, for example.Be aware that some firms might want to emphasize the ratio that makes them look the best.IBD is generally consistent in looking at just one ratio: the long-term debt to stockholders' equity. One place where you can find this figure is within the Stock Checkup feature at Investors.com, IBD's website.Don't Become FanaticalYou don't want to become fanatical in avoiding companies with sizable debt.Some sectors, like telecom infrastructure and energy, are simply prone to using lots of debt. Some of the market's leading stocks in recent years were far from debt-free, but this didn't hold them back from making big advances.Concho Resources (CXO) is one example. The Midland, Texas-based oil and gas explorer's debt-to-equity ratio stood at 63% at the end of 2009, but the stock still nearly doubled in 2010.TransDigm Group (TDG) provides another example. The Cleveland-based aircraft components maker sported an eye-popping debt-to-equity ratio of 299% at the end of 2010. A major reason: TransDigm is acquisitive. Even so, TransDigm's shares scored a solid gain of 33% in 2011.At the same time, you can't get everything you need from the debt-to-equity ratio.It's also smart to look at a company's regulatory filings to see if it discloses any off-balance-sheet liabilities, which are not incorporated into shareholders' equity. Retailers are known for doing this with store lease obligations. Financial firms are infamous for being creative in this area.Off The Balance SheetYou can see off-balance-sheet liabilities in sectors where you might not expect it. Take Netflix (NFLX), the DVD-rental-by-mail pioneer that's now focusing on its streaming video business.One challenge for the company is the cost of each TV show or movie that it beams over the Internet to a user.As you might expect, the Silicon Valley company has made a number of deals to get this content. What you might not expect is that these deals aren't all accounted for on Netflix's balance sheet as liabilities.With its 10-K filed with the SEC on Feb. 1, Netflix declared $3.2 billion in total liabilities. But deeper in the 10-K — on page 57 — you'll find something else worth knowing.The report says: ""The Company had $5.6 billion and $4.8 billion of obligations at December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, respectively, including agreements to license streaming content that represent current or long-term liabilities or that are not reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets because they do not meet content library asset recognition criteria.""

305,TDG,"Last In A SeriesA stock can have great fundamentals and a solid chart, but if big investors aren't buying it, it's not going to get very far.To see what the big guns are doing, read IBD's Mutual Fund monthly and quarterly special sections. These are typically published during the first week of each month.Institutional buying is a key part of CAN SLIM investing. Mutual funds and other professionals dominate the trading on the major stock exchanges. Armed with millions of dollars to invest, these market players create the huge run-ups in stocks that can last weeks, months or longer.Therefore, pay attention to what stocks they're buying for clues on potential future winners. The information in the special sections may be dated but stay relevant for months.At the same time, watch out for stocks they are unloading. These can come crashing down, especially after a long advance.The Mutual Fund monthly and quarterly special sections provide tables of stocks that the top-performing mutual funds were buying and selling in recent months. The reports detail how many top funds are buying and the total dollar amounts that they've put to work.Stocks being gobbled up can make good watch-list candidates. But also look to see for any sector rotation going on.In the third quarter of 2011, top funds bought gold stocks such as Randgold Resources (GOLD), Eldorado Gold (EGO) and Newmont Mining (NEM). These stocks staged gains from breakouts as gold prices surged above $1,900 an ounce.More recently, the Feb. 3 special section pointed out that mutual fund managers were busy snapping up stocks from an array of industry groups.One top purchase by top funds was TransDigm (TDG). Twelve funds invested a total of $16 million in the stock. TransDigm makes pumps, valves, batteries and a variety of other equipment for commercial and military aircraft.The stock blew past a 99.53 buy point from a cup-with-handle base Jan. 23.

The test can be double to an investor, for whom waiting can also risk missing a breakout and gaining entry to a winning run.So God invented handles.In stock charts, handles occur most commonly at the end of cup bases. They form less often on double-bottom and flat bases. But in nearly all cases, they offer an earlier entry into a rising stock.No matter the type of base, a handle must be at least five days long. Start counting on the first down day. Mark the buy point a dime above the highest intraday high etched along the handle structure. (This high mark sometimes appears on a day before the five-day handle count begins.)In a cup base, the midpoint between the handle's highest and lowest price points must be higher than the midpoint between the highest and lowest points marking the left side of the cup. Handles that fail this test may still be useable, but carry added risk.A handle should also form above a stock's 10-week moving average. In the best handles, the price lows drift lower in declining volume. Upward wedging handles along the lows signal the weak underlying shareholders may not be shaken out, and the stock's supply-vs.-demand profile may not be ready for a market-leading run.Handles aren't perfect formations. It's good to keep in mind that if we look back over the past few years, the performance of some highly rated stocks that formed handles on flat and double-bottom bases was not stellar.The reason may have more to do with the fact that a stock had already made many bases. Plus, the bulk of recent double-bottom-with-handle breakouts occurred at or near market tops, or in stocks with further consolidating to do before breaking out into winning runs.A great stock will set up a new base. Take Apple (AAPL), which cleared a 208.10 buy point in a flat base with handle in December 2009. It immediately pulled back more than 8%. But it then formed a six-week cup and launched into its multiyear advance.TransDigm Group (TDG) topped a handle buy point of 108 in a flat base on April 12. The handle formed low in the base, and the breakout occurred in soft trade. But investors who bought at the handle buy point were rewarded, as the stock gained 31% by last month.Another recent example: Martin Marietta Materials (MLM), which cleared a flat base with handle at 90.52 on Nov. 29.Handles on some double-bottom bases have shown more dubious results. Bucyrus International staged a weak but ultimately successful breakout from a double-bottom-with-handle base in October 2007, before it was acquired by Caterpillar (CAT).MEMC Materials (WFR) cleared a double bottom with handle in late October 2007. It rose briefly before slipping into a multiyear decline.Natural gas producer XTO (acquired by Exxon Mobil (XOM) in 2010) cleared a double-bottom-with-handle base in weak trade in July 2006. The stock soon slipped into another base, which could have been read also as a double bottom with handle. XTO eventually mounted a 104% advance from its original double-bottom-with-handle buy point.

"
338,TDG,"Due in part to acquisitions, the company lifted its full-year profit outlook to $6.23-$6.57 a share from its old view of $5.66-$6.00. It expects revenue of $1.67 billion-$1.7 billion, up from $1.47 billion-$1.51 billion.

343,TDG,"But the aftermarket growth outlook is unchanged at about 10%.

"
351,TDG,"Commercial aftermarket sales have been flat sequentially for three quarters, Ciarmoli noted.
"
352,TDG,"But more than 90% of sales are of proprietary parts, giving TransDigm more pricing power than other aerospace parts suppliers, potentially helping offset any weakness in volume.

678,TDG,"Stocks extended gains in late trading Friday and were on pace to end higher for the week and month. The Nasdaq surged 2.8%, which would mark the biggest gain of the year. The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average climbed 2.2% and 2% respectively. Turnover continued to track higher on both major exchanges. TransDigm (TDG) rallied 5% to…

679,TDG,"The market correction continues to hammer even the most resilient stocks. But Your Weekly Review still carries a sizable number of highly-rated names bucking the decline.Fast drops by issues including 3D Systems (DDD) and TransDigm (TDG) this week have been a common refrain. When a stock makes a sharp pullback in heavy volume, it's not the time to be a hero.Instead, wait for evidence of solid institutional support. Note those stocks that build good bases even as the major indexes founder.So, what are some names showing true strength lately?The RV makers have been on a roll. Thor Industries (THO) is no exception. Even though the Jackson Center, Ohio-based firm has fallen six of the past seven sessions, see its weekly chart. The stock still enjoys a large air pocket above its fast-rising 10-week moving average.The stock, which carries a 92 EPS Rating and a 96 RS, has yet to touch that 10-week line since clearing a 33.90 cup-with-handle entry.PolyOne (POL) and Ingredion (INGR), a maker of starches and liquid sweeteners, have been acting in similar fashion to Thor. Ingredion is down for the week but that follows four straight weeks of big gains.The accelerating downside volume in PolyOne deserves genuine concern. Since late July, however, the polymer and resin maker has enjoyed strong support several times at its 10-week line.Leggett & Platt (LEG) is arguably going through a second rebound off the 10-week line. The furniture maker is just 3% past a four-weeks-tight follow-on entry at 25.40.Sherwin-Williams (SHW) is rebounding back above the 10-week moving average. Watch for a new base to form.Myriad Genetics (MYGN) and  DaVita (DVA) should not be ignored, even though they are extended. The former is showing good action after roaring out of a base-on-base formation at 28.68. The latter is showing tight weekly closes and working on nine straight up weeks.

697,TDG,"The blood and sacrifice of the U.S. military force over the years has made the nation a military superpower. However, while we pay homage to our heroes on the occasion of Memorial Day, we should also respect the contribution of the U.S. Aerospace and Defense industry to the economy.  We dig deeper into the industry and highlight why some top picks could not earn you smart gains ahead.Geopolitical RisksInvestors should note that with geopolitical uncertainty on the rise, developed as well as emerging nations have been increasing their defense spending. A stressed relationship between the United States and North Korea has long been a hot affair.On Thursday, the White House called off the planned Jun 12 meeting in Singapore due to North Korea’s “tremendous anger and open hostility” targeted toward Washington. Though in response to the cancellation of the meeting, Kim Jong Un made comments in a peacemaking tone, sensing a possible warfare, defense stocks went northward.Added to this, the Iran deal was suspended a few days back. There is tension related to the civil war in Syria. All these have given a boost to defense stocks (read: Defense Stocks Rally on Iran Deal: 4 Hot Picks).Trump BumpTrump’s victory in the U.S. Presidential election in Nov 2016 provided a boost to the defense sector due to his proposals for a massive increase in defense spending. He is expected to boost U.S. military spending considerably. Plus, the intrinsic strength of the stocks in this space is worthy of mention.Greater Mergers and Acquisitions The Aerospace and Defense sector is thriving with mergers and acquisitions. An analysis by Capstone Headwaters revealed that the amount of activities within the aerospace and defense world rose 2% in 2017 compared with a 16% decline the prior year. Among the hot deals, there was a $30-billion deal between United Technologies and the avionics and interiors maker Rockwell Collins. Boeing also announced its acquisition of advanced aerospace and autonomous systems manufacturer Aurora Flight Sciences in October 2017.Superb EarningsAerospace, which accounts for a meager 1.7% of the S&P 500 index, came up with impressive beat ratios in the Q1 reporting cycle. All companies have reported earnings in this season, with 90.9% companies beating earnings estimates while 81.8% surpassing the top line.The space posted a 37.8% surge in earnings in Q1 on 7.8% revenue growth. The scenario should be steady in Q2 with a likely earnings growth rate of 17.6% on 4.2% revenue growth, as per the Earnings Trends issued on May 23, 2018.Strong Sector FundamentalsGrowing civilian demand thanks to an improving global economy, aging commercial aircraft and the consequent rise in aircraft orders, a pickup in defense spending in certain other countries including Brazil, India and Saudi Arabia plus technological innovation and acquisitions have brightened the appeal for the sector.Stocks to PlayAgainst this backdrop, below we highlight a few top-ranked defense stocks that could fatten your portfolio.Wesco Aircraft Holdings Inc.

700,TDG,"TransDigm Group Incorporated (TDG  -  Free Report) managed to impress investors with its recent earnings streak as the company’s bottom line trumped estimates thrice in the trailing four quarters. We believe that the company’s strong operational efficiency, its solid portfolio of products as well as complementary acquisitions will continue to be key growth drivers, going forward.The company’s stock has had an impressive run on the bourse in the past three months, driven by some impressive growth boosters. The stock has rallied 17.4%, ahead of the industry’s growth of 2.5%. We believe that the company’s encouraging traction across markets and a robust product portfolio will propel growth. Read on to find out the key catalysts for the company right now.Factors at PlayTransDigm’s excellent business operation model, which implements value-based operating strategies guided by three value driver concepts, has helped the company generate sufficient organic and inorganic growth, expanding the operating margin over the past few quarters.Moreover, through its well-diversified business, the company offers a broad range of products to its customers. Notably, it designs, produces and supplies highly engineered proprietary aerospace components and certain systems, commanding a significant aftermarket presence. For instance, 90% of TransDigm’s net sales is generated from the proprietary engineered products the intellectual property right of which, the company owns and enjoys to enhance its competitive edge. Also, the company is the sole supplier of more than three-fourth of products that it sells. This in turn, cements its assertive foothold in the market quite meaningfully.Further, we believe that stable aftermarkets, which have historically produced higher gross margins, will continue to leverage the company’s financial performance in the upcoming quarters. Of late, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) player’s defense business has also been steady enough to consistently add to its strength.This apart, the company’s acquisition strategies are directed toward buying proprietary aerospace businesses with substantial aftermarket content. This tactical move has in fact, already helped TransDigm strengthen its footprint in the core markets and grab a higher market share. In this regard, the company during fiscal 2017, had announced the buyout of three add-on aerospace product lines for a total consideration of roughly $100 million.We are also highly optimistic about TransDigm’s consolidations of Kirkhill and Extant in March 2018. Both companies are primarily proprietary sole source aerospace businesses with sizeable aftermarket content. Such strategic transactions are expected to be accretive to the acquirer’s product portfolio and contribute to its long-term growth.Other Stocks to ConsiderOther top-ranked stocks in the same space include AeroVironment, Inc. (AVAV  -  Free Report), CPI Aerostructures, Inc. (CVU  -  Free Report) and KLX Inc. (KLXI  -  Free Report).

702,TDG,"In a not so surprising move on May 8, the United States withdrew from the historic deal designed to contain Iran’s nuclear program. Further, a spate of other sanctions is likely to be slapped on the Middle Eastern country. President Trump has characterized the Iran nuclear agreement as a “horrible one-sided deal that should have never, ever been made.”However, since the deal was suspended, defense stocks have rallied, primarily due to international geopolitical tensions that such developments give rise to. Investors can make the most of this opportunity to bet on the top defense stocks for alluring returns.Geopolitical Tensions Post Trump’s AnnouncementQuite expectedly, the sanctions and a complete annulment of the deal hasn’t gone down too well with Iran. The country has openly criticized such a decision by Trump, with its president Hassan Rouhani stating that Iran choses to stay in the deal even without the United States.Adding to the already tense environment, state-governed media from Syria reported on the afternoon of May 8 that Israel had fired missiles on sites near Damascus that are linked to Iran. Further, Saudi Arabia stated on May 9 that its air force had neutralized two more ballistic missiles over its city Riyadh, apparently fired by Houthi rebels from Yemen.Analysts fear that if the nuclear deal is not kept alive till the end of this year and if U.S. reimposes sanctions that were already in effect before the deal, the situation may worsen. Going by the trend, Trump is unlikely to budge from his decision and the nuclear deal might not make it through the next year. Such circumstances are likely to aggravate tensions to quite an extent.Defense Stocks on a TearDefense heavyweights such as Lockheed Martin, Raytheon (RTN), Boeing, Northrop Grumman (NOC) and General Dynamics (GD) have rallied since Trump’s annulment of the deal. Between May 8 and May 11, shares of these giants have gained 1.4%, 2.6%, 1%, 1.7% and 2.4%, respectively, on the back of geopolitical uncertainties associated with such developments.Defense contractors with significant exposure to the Middle East are poised to gain immensely from international tensions that are flaring up.

703,TDG,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Transdigm Group Incorporated (TDG  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 1.74% in that time frame.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is TDG due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.TransDigm's Q1 Earnings Impressive, Revenues BeatTransDigm reported first-quarter fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings of $5.58 per share, which reflected growth of a whopping 121.4% year over year. The bottom line gained from the favorable impact of the recent tax reforms.Decent top-line growth and improvements in the operating margin also drove earnings. In addition, continued efforts to boost productivity, lower refinancing costs as well as lower acquisition-related costs proved conducive to earnings growth. This was partially offset by higher interest outlay.Inside the HeadlinesNet sales for the reported quarter amounted to $848 million, reflecting year-over-year growth of 4.2%. However, the top line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $862 million.Decent growth in Commercial Aftermarket (up 10% year over year) revenues supplemented the top-line performance. Furthermore, contributions from the previously-completed acquisitions boosted the overall sales performance during the fiscal first quarter. TransDigm’s commercial aftermarket transport business witnessed solid year-over-year revenue growth. However, Defense and Commercial OEM remained flat year over year.TransDigm’s EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) grew 18.4% year over year to $382.5 million.During fiscal 2017, TransDigm had announced the acquisition of three add-on aerospace product lines, for a total consideration of roughly $100 million. These product lines mainly comprise proprietary, sole-source products with significant aftermarket content. The product lines are in sync with the company’s long-term plan and highlight its strategy to acquire proprietary aerospace businesses with significant aftermarket content, in a bid to fortify its core business.The acquired business lines have combined revenues of about $32 million and will be consolidated into TransDigm’s existing businesses. The company financed the acquisitions through existing cash on hand.These acquisitions will add to TransDigm’s product range with the proprietary products which enjoy strong positions on high use of platforms, robust aftermarket content and an excellent reputation. Products offered include highly engineered aerospace controls, quick disconnect couplings, as well as communication electronics.LiquidityTransDigm ended the fiscal first quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $857.9 million, up from $650.6 million as of Sep 30, 2017. At the end of the reported quarter, the company’s long-term debt was $11.4 billion, nearly flat compared with the figure recorded at the end of September 2017.Fiscal 2018 GuidanceConcurrent with the fiscal first-quarter results, the company reiterated its revenue outlook and revised its earnings guidance for fiscal 2018, to incorporate the new tax regulations. Adjusted earnings per share are now forecast to be in the band of $16.95-$17.59 per share, in comparison to the earlier guided range of $12.78-$13.42 per share. The company had generated earnings of $12.38 per share in fiscal 2017.Sales are expected to lie in the range of $3,645-$3,725 million (compared with $3,504 million reported in fiscal 2017). The fiscal 2018 guidance assumes that commercial aftermarket and OEM revenues will grow in the mid-single-digit percentage range, while defense revenues will be up in the low- to mid-single-digit percentage range.Estimated net income from continuing operations lies in the band of $906-$942 million, up from the earlier projection of $702-$738 million, while EBITDA is likely to be in the range of $1,805-$1,855 million.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in fresh estimates. There have been four revisions higher for the current quarter compared to one lower. In the past month, the consensus estimate has shifted by 15.21% due to these changes.Transdigm Group Incorporated Price and Consensus Transdigm Group Incorporated Price and Consensus | Transdigm Group Incorporated QuoteVGM ScoresCurrently, TDG has a subpar Growth Score of D, however its Momentum is doing a lot better with an A.

The bottom line gained from the favorable impact of the recent tax reforms.Decent top-line growth and improvements in operating margin also drove earnings. In addition, continued efforts to boost productivity, lower refinancing costs as well as lower acquisition-related costs proved conducive to earnings growth.

Furthermore, contributions from the previously-completed acquisitions boosted overall sales performance during the fiscal second quarter.TransDigm’s EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) grew 9.8% year over year to $463.1 million.Transdigm Group Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Transdigm Group Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Transdigm Group Incorporated QuoteAcquisitions & DivestituresTransDigm frequently acquires proprietary aerospace businesses with significant aftermarket content, which boosts its footprint in its core market and is in line with its operating strategies. During the quarter, it acquired the Kirkhill engineered elastomers business from Esterline Corporation for $50 million.

At the end of the reported quarter, the company’s long-term debt was $11.4 billion, nearly flat compared with the figure recorded at the end of September 2017.Fiscal 2018 GuidanceConcurrent with the fiscal second-quarter results, the company raised its revenue and earnings guidance for fiscal 2018 to incorporate the impressive operating performance so far in fiscal 2018, new tax regulations and recent acquisitions. Adjusted earnings per share are now forecast to be in the band of $17.35-$17.99 per share compared with the earlier guided range of $16.95-$17.59 per share.

Net income from continuing operations is estimated in the band of $902-$938 million, compared with the earlier projection of $906-$942 million, while EBITDA is likely to be in the range of $1,830-$1,880 million.Our TakeTransDigm’s thriving commercial aftermarket business proved to be a strong growth driver for its fiscal second-quarter results. The aftermarket business comprises 55% of sales, but typically makes up more than 75% of the company’s EBITDA. This translates into consistent revenue generation capacity through all phases of the aerospace cycle. The aftermarket business is expanding as majority of the aircraft bought during the financial crisis are beginning to age, and require more frequent and comprehensive servicing.We believe stable aftermarkets, which have historically produced higher gross margins, will continue to drive financial performance in the upcoming quarters.However, softness in business jet, helicopter and freighter revenues, have been hurting the company’s profits. In addition to this, weakness in the global macroeconomic conditions is affecting air travel, adding to the company’s woes. The company is concerned about the future of the commercial transport industry. These factors can play spoilsport for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company in the near term.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the industry include CPI Aerostructures, Inc.

Of the total amount, $686.1 billion has been reserved as funding for the Pentagon, reflecting 5% real growth over the initial FY18  budget and 10% real growth over the current Continuing Resolution. A steady flow of contracts from the Pentagon also provided an impetus to the stocks. Moreover, growing international market for weaponries with several nations increasing their defense spending is also likely to fuel the industry’s growth.With almost 921 companies (142 S&P 500 members) slated to report first-quarter results this week, let's find out how the following defense stocks are poised before their earnings release on May 1.L3 Technologies, Inc. (LLL  -  Free Report) delivered a positive earnings surprise of 2.17% in the last reported quarter. The company outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 6.61%.Usually contract wins from the Pentagon as well as foreign allies of the United States drive revenues for defense contractors like L3 Technologies. Unfortunately, the company did not secure any notable contract during the first quarter of 2018. This is likely to weigh on the company’s revenues for the to-be-reported quarter.L3 Technologies’ strong balance sheet provides financial flexibility in matters of incremental dividends, ongoing share repurchases and earnings accretive acquisitions. Continuing with its trend of consistent dividend hike, the company raised its quarterly dividend by 6.7% in February 2018 to 80 cents. The company’s balance sheet is expected to display solid figures during the earnings call.Per our proven model, a stock is likely to beat earnings estimate if it has a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Impressively, L3 Technologies constitutes that combination.The company has an Earnings ESP of +4.33%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.L3 Technologies currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.

The company projects operating profit and bottom-line growth to benefit from the same in the to-be-reported quarter.However, Transdigm has been witnessing negative trends in some end markets, of late, like weaker defense after-market orders as well as soft business jet, helicopter and freighter revenues. This is likely to dent its top-line growth.Of late, the company’s Defense business’ performance has been better than expectations, adding to its strength. Moreover, a diversified revenue base lowers the company’s dependence on any particular product, platform or market channel and will continue to play a significant role in maintaining financial performance in the near future.The Earnings ESP for Transdigm is -1.34%.

RGI is managed by Invesco Powershares.

711,TDG,"TransDigm Group Inc. (TDG  -  Free Report) has managed to impress investors with its recent earnings streak, wherein the company’s bottom line has trumped estimates thrice in the trailing four quarters. TransDigm’s impressive business model actively works toward strengthening and enhancing its position in highly-engineered proprietary aerospace components’ niche markets.We believe that the company’s strong operational execution, solid portfolio of products as well as complementary acquisitions should continue boosting growth, moving ahead.Consequently, TransDigm’s shares have had an impressive run on the bourse over the past six months. The stock has gained 16.3%, compared with the industry’s rally of 9.5%. We expect the company’s remarkable traction across markets to continue in the upcoming quarters as well. Given this backdrop, let’s delve deeper to find out key drivers for the company right now.Factors to ConsiderTransDigm’s business operation model is driven by three value driver concepts has helped the company generate sufficient organic and inorganic growth, and drive operating margin expansion over the past few quarters. Also, it designs, produces and supplies highly engineered proprietary aerospace components and certain systems with a significant aftermarket presence. In this regard, 90% of TransDigm’s net sales are generated from proprietary engineered products, for which the company enjoys the intellectual property right, thus enhancing its competitive strength meaningfully.Moreover, the company’s penchant for acquisitions of proprietary aerospace businesses with significant aftermarket content has helped it to bolster footprint in core market and grab a higher market share. In fiscal 2017, TransDigm acquired three add-on aerospace product lines, for a total consideration of roughly $100 million.These acquisitions should add to its product range with the proprietary products, which already enjoy strong positions on high use of platforms and robust aftermarket content. Further, its Defense business has been experiencing stability, thus adding to the company’s strength.Also, decentralized organizational structure and a unique compensation system for senior management have created a potent workforce that acts as one of the company’s major assets. This apart, a diversified revenue base reduces TransDigm’s dependence on any particular product, platform or market channel, thus playing a crucial role in maintaining its financial performance.However, the company is suffering from escalating debt burden and consequent higher interest expenses. Its interest expenses have also been trending upward for the past few quarters. For instance, TransDigm recorded an interest expense of about $15 million, up 10% from the previous quarter, mainly on account of increase in its total debt. We believe that rising interest expenses will continue restraining its profits, going ahead.This apart, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has been suffering from prolonged weakness in some of its major end market that has thwarted the company’s growth momentum. Softening discretionary retrofits, interior retrofits and weakness in jet and helicopter markets have also impacted its top-line performance in recent times.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks from the same space include Curtiss-Wright Corp.

712,TDG,"Raytheon Company’s (RTN  -  Free Report) Missile Systems business segment recently won a modification contract for production of Advanced Medium Range Air to Air Missile’s (AMRAAM) 31st Lot. Work related to the deal is scheduled to be over by Jan 31, 2021.Details of the DealValued at $523.1 million, the contract was awarded by the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center, Air Dominance Contracting Office, Eglin Air Force Base, Florida. The modification also provides for the production of AMRAAM’s 32nd Lot and other AMRAAM systems items.Raytheon will execute the task for this deal at Tucson, AZ. Per the terms, the agreement involves foreign military sales (“FMS”) to Japan, Kuwait, Poland, Indonesia, Qatar, Germany, Australia and the United Kingdom. FMS funds will be primarily utilized to finance the contract, while fiscal 2018 production as well as research and development funds will finance a smaller portion of the deal.A Brief Note on AMRAAMRaytheon’s AMRAAM is the world's most sophisticated air dominance weapon, with operational flexibility during air-to-air and surface-launch engagements. Its capabilities have been fully demonstrated in more than 4,200 test shots and 10 air-to-air combat victories.Per Raytheon, in the air-to-air role, no other missile compares to the AMRAAM missile. The weapon's advanced active guidance section provides aircrew with a high degree of combat flexibility and lethality. This weapon has been procured by as many as 37 nations, including the United States. It has been installed in top-quality military jets like F-16, F-15, F/A-18, F-22, Typhoon, Gripen, Tornado and Harrier.Its latest version, the AMRAAM-Extended Range missile is a new, ground-launched solution that will intercept targets at longer distances and higher altitudes.Our ViewWith an increase in cyber-attacks, terror threats and geopolitical instability, a rapid rise in defense spending has been witnessed among countries to strengthen their national security worldwide. As a result, America has been observing a solid inflow of military contracts lately, particularly for missile-defense, in the wake of the consistent cross-border tensions that prevailed in 2017 between the United States and North Korea.With Raytheon being one of the defense majors in the United States, Raytheon’s Missile Systems segment has been clinching significant awards from the United States as well as international customers, courtesy of its high-end, combat-proven advanced arsenal. For instance, the company won a $2.3-billionhybrid contract for providing engineering services to the Phased Array Tracking Radar Intercept on Target (PATRIOT) weapon systems program, at the end of January 2018.Based on the 15% sales growth at Missile Systems in fourth-quarter 2017 and the growing demand for Raytheon’s Integrated Air and Missile Defense portfolio in domestic as well as international markets, we expect this unit to scale new highs post winning contracts like the latest one. Moreover, the recently released fiscal 2019 defense budget aims at spending $12.9 billion for enhancements of U.S. missile defense capabilities, of which $12.9 billion is allocated for missile defense. Notably, the budget includes an investment plan of $1.1 billion for 240 Patriot Missile Segment Enhancements. This in turn reflects higher growth prospects for Raytheon and we expect the company to win more such contracts from the Pentagon in the coming days.Price PerformanceShares of Raytheon have rallied about 42% in a year, compared with the broader industry’s gain of 35.4%. The company’s growing demand for missile defense systems and expanding overseas business boosted the performance.  Zacks Rank & Stocks to Consider    Raytheon carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the same space are Curtiss-Wright Corporation (CW  -  Free Report), Transdigm Group (TDG  -  Free Report) and Hexcel Corporation (HXL  -  Free Report), each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

713,TDG,"TransDigm Group Incorporated (TDG  -  Free Report) continued its acquisition spree as the company inked a definitive agreement to buy Extant Components Group Holdings, Inc. — a portfolio company of Warburg Pincus LLC — for nearly $525 million. This comes close on the heels of the Kirkhill acquisition from Esterline Corporation (ESL  -  Free Report) last week.Extant is a provider of proprietary aftermarket products and repair & overhaul services to the aerospace and defense end markets. The deal is expected to close in second quarter 2018 and subject to customary closing conditions and approvals. It will be financed through a combination of cash on hand and existing availability under TransDigm’s revolving credit facility.Extant exclusively licenses or acquires proprietary aftermarket-focused products from leading aerospace and defense OEMs. Thereafter, it supports these products over the useful lives of the aircraft on which the equipment is installed. The firm currently derives about 80% of its annual revenues from the aftermarket, almost all of which is generated from proprietary and sole source products. A majority of the sales are derived from military end market, with the remainder from commercial applications market.The company presently owns or exclusively licenses more than 2,500 assemblies and sub-assemblies on over 70 active platforms. This makes Extant an attractive value proposition to OEMs. Thus, Extant enjoys an active pipeline of new product line acquisition opportunities.Notably, TransDigm’s long-term growth strategy rests on five pillars, one of which is expanding its proprietary aerospace businesses. Also, it frequently acquires proprietary aerospace businesses, with significant aftermarket content, which strengthens the company’s foothold in its core market and is in line with its operating strategies. In fact, 90% of TransDigm’s net sales stem from proprietary engineered products, and the Extant and Kirkhill acquisitions are expected to add to the same.In the past three years, the company has acquired about $3 billion of proprietary aerospace businesses. Additionally, TransDigm has been integrating recent product line acquisitions of Preece, Cablecraft and North Hills into AdelWiggins, AeroControlex and Data Device Corporation, respectively, over the past few months.Extant’s unique model fits nicely with TransDigm’s proprietary and aftermarket-focused value generation strategy. TransDigm’s shares have appreciated 14.4% over the past six months, outperforming the industry’s rally of 9.7%. Meanwhile, the company’s buyouts of proprietary aerospace businesses with significant aftermarket content have helped it bolster footprint in core market and grab a higher market share. In the fiscal first quarter, the company’s acquired businesses generated $32 million of additional sales. The company anticipates these acquisitions to help shift focus to higher growth segments, consequently becoming more competitive.Also, TransDigm’s earnings have trumped estimates in three of the trailing four quarters.

715,TDG,"Raytheon Company’s (RTN  -  Free Report) Missile Systems (MS) business unit recently won a $93 million modification contract for the integration of Small Diameter Bomb II (SDB II) in F/A-18E/F aircraft. The contract was awarded by the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center, Eglin Air Force Base, Florida.Details of the DealPer the terms of the deal, Raytheon will provide testing, analysis and support services along with the sustainment of SDB II weapon onto the F/A-18E/F platform with additional developmental and operational testing. Work related to the deal will be performed in Tucson, AZ and is expected to get completed by Jul 1, 2023.Advantages of the SDB II WeaponRaytheon’s StormBreaker bomb, formerly known as the Small Diameter Bomb II (SDB II), provides war fighters with the ability to hit moving targets in all-weather conditions, especially when the visibility is limited. The SDB-II is capable of three modes; a millimeter wave radar that detects and tracks targets through all weather, imaging infrared for improved target discrimination, and a semi-active laser allowing it to track lasers in the air or on the ground. Further, the weapon can fly more than 45 miles to strike mobile targets.Due to such unmatched battlefield advantages, the U.S. Air Force and the U.S. Navy have begun StormBreaker bomb integration activities on the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter and the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet aircraft.What’s Favoring Raytheon?Increasing geo-political tensions across the globe have prompted nations to strengthen their defense systems manifold. With rapid technological upgrade, missile defense has steadily emerged to play a pivotal role for a nation’s defense strategy.To this end, Raytheon’s advanced MS segment has been clinching significant awards from the United States as well as international customers, courtesy of its high-end, combat-proven arsenals. The latest contract win is an evidence to that.Notably, the MS division recorded first-quarter 2018 net sales of $1,848 million, reflecting a 5% improvement from the year-ago quarter. We may expect the aforementioned contract to instill further growth in this segment, going ahead.Furthermore, the recently approved U.S. fiscal 2019 defense budget includes a spending plan of $4.6 billion on Preferred Munitions. The budget proposal hints at a prospective increase in selection of Raytheon’s SDB II weapon by Pentagon that has been allotted $400 million. Such favorable budgetary developments reflect solid growth prospects for Raytheon’s SDB II program going ahead, which, in turn, are likely to boost the company’s profit margin.Price MovementRaytheon’s stock has gained 20.3% in the last 12 months, compared with the industry’s growth of 21.2%. The underperformance may have been caused due to tough competition in the market and political uncertainties.Zacks Rank & Key Picks    Raytheon currently holds a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

717,TDG,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Transdigm Group Incorporated (TDG  -  Free Report). Shares have added about 6% in that time frame.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is TDG due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.TransDigm Q2 Earnings Strong, Sales Up Y/Y, View UpTransDigm reported second-quarter fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings of $3.79 per share, which reflected growth of an impressive 25.1% year over year. The bottom line gained from the favorable impact of the recent tax reforms.Decent top-line growth and improvements in the operating margin also drove earnings. In addition, continued efforts to boost productivity, lower refinancing costs as well as lower acquisition-related costs proved conducive to earnings growth. This was partially offset by higher interest outlay.Inside the HeadlinesNet sales for the reported quarter amounted to $933.1 million, reflecting year-over-year growth of 7.4%. Organic sales grew 6.6%.Decent growth in Commercial Aftermarket revenues supplemented the top-line performance. Furthermore, contributions from the previously-completed acquisitions boosted the overall sales performance during the fiscal second quarter.TransDigm’s EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) grew 9.8% year over year to $463.1 million.Acquisitions & DivestituresTransDigm frequently acquires proprietary aerospace businesses with significant aftermarket content, which boosts its footprint in its core market and is in line with its operating strategies. During the quarter, it acquired the Kirkhill engineered elastomers business from Esterline Corporation for $50 million. The Kirkhill business makes specialty seals and other rubber components meant primarily for aerospace and defense markets.Also, TransDigm completed the sale of Schroth in a management buyout to a private equity fund and certain members of Schroth management for approximately $61 million.Earlier, during fiscal 2017, TransDigm had announced the acquisition of three add-on aerospace product lines, for a total consideration of roughly $100 million. These product lines mainly comprise proprietary, sole-source products with significant aftermarket content. The product lines are in sync with the company’s long-term plan and highlight its strategy to acquire proprietary aerospace businesses with significant aftermarket content, in a bid to fortify its core business.The acquired business lines have combined revenues of about $32 million and will be consolidated into TransDigm’s existing businesses. The company financed the acquisitions through existing cash on hand.These acquisitions will add to TransDigm’s product range with the proprietary products which enjoy strong positions on high use of platforms, robust aftermarket content and an excellent reputation. Products offered include highly engineered aerospace controls, quick disconnect couplings, as well as communication electronics.LiquidityTransDigm ended the fiscal second quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $1,011 million, up from $650.6 million as of Sep 30, 2017. At the end of the reported quarter, the company’s long-term debt was $11.4 billion, nearly flat compared with the figure recorded at the end of September 2017.Fiscal 2018 GuidanceConcurrent with the fiscal second-quarter results, the company raised its revenue and earnings guidance for fiscal 2018, to incorporate the impressive operating performance so far in fiscal 2018, new tax regulations and recent acquisitions. Adjusted earnings per share are now forecast to be in the band of $17.35-$17.99 per share, in comparison to the earlier guided range of $16.95-$17.59 per share. The company had generated earnings of $12.38 per share in fiscal 2017.Sales are now expected to lie in the range of $3,740-$3,820 million (compared with $3,645-$3,725 million guided earlier). Estimated net income from continuing operations lies in the band of $902-$938 million, compared with the earlier projection of $906-$942 million, while EBITDA is likely to be in the range of $1,830-$1,880 million.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in fresh estimates.

718,TDG,"Benchmarks finished in the red on Thursday following concerns over a likely delay in the Trump administration’s tax cut plans. The Senate Finance Committee released a tax plan which aims to reduce corporate tax rate to 20% but not before 2019, in contrast to the 2018 deadline proposed by the House Republicans. Although, investors turned jittery following concerns that tax cut may be delayed, markets curtailed some of the day’s declines after the House Ways and Committee passed a bill to reframe the tax reforms.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) decreased 0.4%, to close at 23,461.94. The S&P 500 Index (INX) fell 0.4% to close at 2,584.62. The tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index (IXIC) closed at 6,750.05, losing 0.6%. A total of 7.4 billion shares were traded on Thursday, higher than the last 20-session average of 6.6 billion shares. Decliners outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by a 1.67-to-1 ratio. On Nasdaq, a 1.62-to-1 ratio favored declining issues. The CBOE VIX decreased 1.1% to close at 9.78.What Dragged Benchmarks Downward?On Thursday, a version of the tax plan was released by the Senate Finance Committee. The Senate version differed from that of the House panel's in several ways. Unlike the House Republicans’ tax proposals which focus on reducing corporate tax rate from 35% to 20%, the Senate version supports a similar tax cut only by2019. Also, per House Republicans, the top individual tax rate would be 39.6%, whereas the Senate version puts the ceiling rate at 38.5%.Worries over a possible delay in tax cut plans weighed on investor sentiment. Although, some of the day’s losses were curtailed after the House Ways and Committee approved a Bill to recast the tax reforms, all the three key U.S. indexes registered their worst trading day in two weeks.

719,TDG,"TransDigm Group Incorporated (TDG  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter fiscal 2018 results before the opening bell on Feb 6. In the quarter to be reported, the company is expected to post solid growth in the Life Sciences & Diagnostics business.The company has an excellent earnings surprise history, having beaten estimates each time over the trailing four quarters, for an average positive surprise of 3%. Last quarter, the company reported earnings of $3.48 per share, reflecting a beat of 3%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Earnings WhispersOur proven model shows that TransDigm has the right combination of the two key ingredients. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is perfectly the case here as you will see below:Zacks ESP: TransDigm has an Earnings ESP of +0.47%, as the Most Accurate estimate of $2.77 is pegged higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.76. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: The company carries a Zacks Rank #3, which when combined with a positive ESP, makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.What’s Driving the Better-Than-Expected Earnings?TransDigm has been riding on robust momentum, driven by complementary acquisitions, positive industry trends, solid operational execution and steadily growing end markets. The company anticipates its operating profit and bottom-line growth to benefit from the same in the to-be reported quarter as well.TransDigm designs, produces and supplies highly engineered proprietary aerospace components and certain systems with a significant aftermarket presence. For instance, about 90% of the company’s sales are generated by proprietary engineered products, that is, products for which the company owns the intellectual property. We believe this would enhance the revenue generation capacity through all phases of the aerospace cycle, consequently supplementing its financials.TransDigm’s thriving after-market business continues to expand as a majority of aircrafts bought during the financial crisis is beginning to age, and requires more frequent and comprehensive servicing. We believe stable after-markets, which have historically produced higher gross margins, will continue to drive its financial performance for the upcoming quarters.Transdigm Group Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Transdigm Group Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Transdigm Group Incorporated QuoteOf late, the company’s Defense business has also been performing better than expectations, adding to its strength. Moreover, a diversified revenue base reduces the company’s dependence on any particular product, platform or market channel, and will continue to play a significant role in maintaining financial performance in the near future.However, TransDigm has been witnessing negative trends in some end markets, of late, like weaker defense after-market orders, and soft business jet, helicopter and freighter revenues. This is likely to strain its top-line growth in the fiscal first-quarter results.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:GlaxoSmithKline PLC (GSK  -  Free Report), with an Earnings ESP of +10.35% and a Zacks Rank of 3, is expected to release quarterly numbers around Feb 7.

Revenues from the Instruments segment came in at $86.0 million, up 10% on a year-over-year basis.The Security segment’s revenues were down 22% to $49.7 million from the prior year, mainly attributable to a decline in Lorex-branded products.

The figures represent year-over-year growth of about 7–13% in adjusted earnings and 7–10% growth in revenues.In fact, the company expects to see an uptick in organic growth second quarter onwards.Our TakeFLIR Systems’ diverse portfolio has been a staple growth driver, helping it offset weaknesses associated with any one market. The company’s restructuring efforts over the past five years have allowed it to streamline business operations and optimize growth. Key metrics like revenues, operating income, operating margin and adjusted EPS continue to benefit from such actions.FLIR Systems is enjoying strong top-line growth, as robust momentum in its commercial products and positive performance of most of its segments drive growth.

(COL  -  Free Report), is slated to report third-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Jul 28, before the opening bell.In the last reported quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 2.29%. Moreover, it surpassed earnings estimates in each of the trailing four quarters with an average positive surprise of 2.45%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayIn the defense arena, Trump’s victory in the Presidential race has likely turned out to be a significant growth catalyst for Rockwell Collins and other defense majors. In particular, the outlook for stocks in this space has improved manifold in the recent months, primarily owing to enhanced spending promises made by Trump in his latest “America First” budget.Following Trump’s budget proposal release in Mar 2017, the U.S. defense contractors are witnessing increased order from across the world, which increases investors’ optimism in such stocks.Consequently, during the fiscal third quarter, the company clinched a number of contracts. It signed a global alliance agreement with QinetiQ to collaborate on the development of next-generation, multi-constellation open service and secure Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receivers. The accord will support the critical mission needs of military, government and critical national infrastructure.Again, Rockwell Collins inked a reseller agreement with Beijing Marine Communication and Navigation Company, Limited (MCN) to provide broadband satellite connectivity services to its ARINC Direct customers in mainland China. These agreements are expected to have a material impact on the company’s financials in the to-be-reported quarter.For the quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings reflects a 3.2% year-over-year decline. Meanwhile, revenues are estimated to be $2.03 billion, translating into 51.9% growth year over year.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Rockwell Collins will beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here, as you will see below:Zacks ESP: Rockwell Collins has an Earnings ESP of -1.27%.

722,TDG,"Investors have been buoyed by TransDigm Group Incorporated’s (TDG  -  Free Report) recent winstreak, as TransDigm’s earnings have trumped estimates in the four trailing quarters. The company is anticipated to continue the momentum driven bycomplementary acquisitions, positive industry trends, solid operational execution and steadily growing end markets.TransDigm’s performance has reflected well on its share price, exhibiting investor optimism. The company’s shares have appreciated 6.4% in the last three months, outperforming the industry’s average growth of 2%. We believe that the industry is witnessing favorable broader trends, which should have a positive impact on the company, in the quarters to come. Read on to find out the key drivers for the company right now.Factors at PlayTransDigm’s long-term growth strategy rests on five pillars namely, expanding proprietary aerospace businesses; executing value-based operating strategy; decentralized organization structure; strategic acquisitions and a diligent capital allocation strategy. The company’s excellent business operation model, which implements value-based operating strategies guided by three value driver concepts, has helped it generate sufficient organic & inorganic growth in the past few quarters. It has also aided operating margin expansion.TransDigm designs, produces and supplies highly engineered proprietary aerospace components and certain systems/subsystems with a significant aftermarket presence. 90% of the company’s net sales are generated by proprietary engineered products, for which the company owns the intellectual property. Moreover, its Defense business has also been performing better than expectations, consequently adding to the company’s strength. The diversified revenue base reduces the company’s dependence on any particular product, platform or market channel thus playing a significant role in maintaining financial performance.The company’s frequent acquisitions of proprietary aerospace businesses with significant aftermarket content, has helped it bolster footprint in core market and grab a higher market share. During the fiscal fourth quarter, the acquired businesses of Tactair, Young & Franklin as well as the three product lines generated $26 million of additional sales. The company anticipates these acquisitions to help shift focus to higher growth segments, consequently becoming more competitive.Despite the positives, TransDigm is currently affected by escalating debt burden and consequent higher interest expenses. Further, the company’s interest expenses have been trending upward for the last few quarters. In fact, it expects debt servicing costs to rise almost 24% year over year to around $600 million in fiscal 2017.Further, the company has been suffering from prolonged weakness in some of its major end markets, which has thwarted growth momentum. Softening discretionary retrofits, interior retrofits and weakness in jet as well as helicopter markets have impacted the top line in recent times.Considering growth drivers and the risks that the company faces, we have a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) on TransDigm.Stocks to Consider Some better-ranked stocks from the same space include Teledyne Technologies Incorporated (TDY  -  Free Report), Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc.

723,TDG,"TransDigm Group Incorporated (TDG  -  Free Report) has decided to divest the SCHROTH business. The company had earlier announced that the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) had been investigating its acquisition of SCHROTH seatbelt and restraints business, which the company concluded in February this year.DoJ requires Transdigm to divest two businesses — SCHROTH Safety Products GmbH and SCHROTH Safety Products — that Transdigm acquired from Takata for $90 million.The DoJ had challenged the acquisition on grounds that the company had a uniquely substantial position in the aerospace seatbelts and restraints business. The DoJ insisted on the divestitures to restore competition in the market for certain restraint systems used on commercial airplanes as the acquisition would have eliminated Transdigm’s most significant competitor in the field.In light of the size of the deal, and risks and expenses associated with carrying on the investigation, TransDigm decided that it would be more prudent to sell the business, thus avoiding any protracted dispute.TransDigm conducted an extensive search and evaluation for a buyer, and is now selling SCHROTH Safety Products in a management buyout to Perusa Partners Fund 2, L.P. Perusa is a private equity fund advised by Perusa GmbH, as majority shareholder, as well as dedicated SCHROTH managers from both Germany and the United States.The proposal has been accepted by the DoJ, subject to court approval. The deal remains subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals.TransDigm’s shares have suffered over the past year, having risen just 9.1% in contrast to the industry’s gain of 28.2%.TransDigm continually adds to its product range with acquisitions of firms with proprietary products which enjoy solid positions on high use of platforms, robust aftermarket content and an excellent reputation. Products offered by the firms include highly engineered aerospace controls, quick disconnect couplings, as well as communication electronics.TransDigm’s thriving aftermarket business continues to expand as a majority of aircraft bought during the financial crisis is beginning to age, and requires more frequent and comprehensive servicing.We believe stable aftermarkets, which have historically produced higher gross margins, will continue to drive financial performance for the upcoming quarters.However, softness in business jet, helicopter and freighter revenues, have been hurting the company’s profits. The company expects that its gross margins will be affected in the upcoming quarters due to increase in interest expenses, which have been flaring up for the last few quarters.In addition to this, weakness in the global macroeconomic conditions is thwarting air travel, adding to the company’s woes. Further, the company has some persistent concerns about the commercial transport industry in the upcoming quarters as well. These factors can play spoilsport for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company in the near term.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the industry are Teledyne Technologies Incorporated (TDY  -  Free Report), Curtiss-Wright Corporation (CW  -  Free Report) and Rockwell Collins, Inc.

724,TDG,"Premium engineered aircraft components provider, TransDigm Group Incorporated (TDG  -  Free Report) reported fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results last week, wherein earnings once again surpassed estimates. Despite recording year-over-year growth, net sales in the quarter trailed the Zacks Consensus Estimate.We anticipate that a continuous rise in interest expenses, weakness in revenues related to business jets, helicopters and freighters, and persistent concerns about the commercial transport industrywill thwart growth for the company in the upcoming quarters.Further, the stock has put up a dismal show in recent times. Over the past three months, TransDigm has lost 4.2%, as against the industry’s gain of 5.4%. Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 earnings has moved south over a couple of months from $13.42 to $13.23, indicating bearish analyst sentiment.  Read on to find the major factors denting the company’s growth and why it may be prudent to avoid this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) stock at the moment.Factors Troubling TransDigmTransDigm’s business remains highly vulnerable to risks associated with macroeconomic conditions. Currently, the company is witnessing some weakness in revenues related to business jets, helicopters and freighters, and expects the adverse trend to persist in near future as well. In addition, weakness in the global macroeconomic conditions is affecting air travel, adding to the company’s woes. Further, the company has some persistent concerns about the commercial transport industry in the upcoming quarters as well.TransDigm has been suffering from prolonged weakness in some of its major end markets, which has thwarted the company’s growth momentum. Softening discretionary retrofits, interior retrofits and weaknesses in jet and helicopter markets have impacted the company’s top line in recent times. TransDigm’s commercial transportation business is plagued by inventory management issues from OEM customers, much of which appears due to rate reductions on wide-body platforms. Also, softness in this market can be traced to a decline in various fleet refurbishment projects.The company expects that its gross margins will be pressured in the upcoming quarters due to increase in interest expenses, which have been trending upward for the last few quarters. In fact, TransDigm expects its debt servicing costs to rise almost 24% year over year to around $600 million in fiscal 2017. Thus, we believe that rising interest expenses will continue to restrain the company’s profits, going forward.These apart, major acquisitions like SCHROTH, DDC, PneuDraulics, Franke and Breeze involve significant integration-related costs, and might also take some time to be properly integrated into the company’s existing business, which further increases costs.Other factors like environmental liabilities and failure to successfully integrate acquisitions also add to the company’s risks.Stocks to Consider Some better-ranked stocks in the industry are Teledyne Technologies Incorporated (TDY  -  Free Report), Rockwell Collins, Inc. (COL  -  Free Report) and Curtiss-Wright Corporation (CW  -  Free Report). While Teledyne Technologies sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Rockwell Collins and Curtiss-Wright carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) each. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Teledyne Technologies has an average positive earnings surprise of 37.2% for the trailing four quarters, having surpassed estimates thrice.Rockwell Collins managed to beat estimates thrice in the trailing four quarters, at an average earnings surprise of 2.6%.Curtiss-Wright has an average positive earnings surprise of 11.8% for the trailing four quarters.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?

725,TDG,"TransDigm Group Incorporated (TDG  -  Free Report) reported its seventh successive earnings beat, as is fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 adjusted earnings came in at $3.48 per share, comfortably beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.38.The figure fared even better in year-over-year comparison, rising 5.8% from the year-ago quarter’s adjusted figure of $3.29.The bottom-line growth came on the back of robust top-line performance and improvements in the operating margin. Also, continued efforts to boost productivity, favorable product mix and lower acquisition-related costs proved conducive to the earnings growth. This was partially offset by higher interest outlay.For fiscal 2017, adjusted net income rose 6.5% year over year to $12.38 per share.Inside the HeadlinesNet sales for the quarter amounted to $923.9 million, reflecting year-over-year growth of 5.6%. However, the top line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $967 million. Organic net sales growth was 2.7%.For fiscal 2017, net sales rose 10.5% over fiscal 2016 to $3,504.3 million, with organic net sales growth of 2.4%.Decent growth in Defense (up 3% year over year) and Commercial Aftermarket (up 4%) revenues supplemented the top-line performance. Furthermore, contributions from the previously-completed acquisitions boosted the overall sales performance during the quarter. TransDigm’s commercial aftermarket transport business witnessed solid year-over-year revenue growth.Majority of the company’s commercial aftermarket businesses witnessed year-over-year revenue growth, which was supplemented by stronger defense revenues. In fiscal 2017, the commercial transport aftermarket revenues were up in the mid-single-digit percentage range, which was partially offset by softness in the interior businesses, and sustained weakness in the business jet and helicopter aftermarket revenues.TransDigm’s EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) grew 8.7% year over year to $460.1 million.Transdigm Group Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Transdigm Group Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Transdigm Group Incorporated QuoteDuring fiscal 2017, TransDigm announced the acquisition of three add-on aerospace product lines, for a total consideration of roughly $100 million. These product lines mainly comprise proprietary, sole-source products with significant aftermarket content. The product lines are in sync with the company’s long-term plan and highlight its strategy to acquire proprietary aerospace businesses with significant aftermarket content, in a bid to fortify its core business.The acquired business lines have combined revenues of about $32 million and will be consolidated into TransDigm’s existing businesses. The company financed the acquisitions through existing cash on hand.These acquisitions will add to TransDigm’s product range with their proprietary products that enjoy strong positions on high use of platforms, robust aftermarket content and an excellent reputation. Products offered by them include highly engineered aerospace controls, quick disconnect couplings, as well as communication electronics.LiquidityTransDigm ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $650.6 million, down from $1587 million as of Sep 30, 2016. At the end of the reported quarter, the company’s long-term debt was $11.4 billion compared with $9.9 billion recorded at the end of September 2016.During fiscal 2017, TransDigm repurchased 1,723,624 shares of its common stock at an aggregate cost of approximately $390 million.Fiscal 2017 GuidanceConcurrent with the fiscal fourth-quarter results, the company issued strong earnings and revenues guidance for fiscal 2018. Sales are expected to lie in the range of $3,645 million to $3,725 million (compared with $3,504 million in fiscal 2017). Also, adjusted earnings per share are predicted to be in the band of $12.78-$13.42 per share, in comparison to $12.38 per share in fiscal 2017.The fiscal 2018 guidance assumes that commercial aftermarket and OEM revenues will grow in mid-single-digit percentage range, while defense revenues will be up in the low- to mid-single-digit percentage range.Additionally, projected net income from continuing operations is estimated to lie in the band of $702-$738 million and EBITDA is likely to be in the range of $1,805-$1,855 million.Our TakeTransDigm’s thriving commercial aftermarket and defense business proved to be staple growth drivers for its fourth-quarter and fiscal 2017 results. The aftermarket business comprises 55% of sales, but makes up more than 75% of EBITDA. This translates into consistent revenue-generation capacity through all phases of the aerospace cycle. The aftermarket business is expanding as majority of aircraft bought during the financial crisis is beginning to age, and requires more frequent and comprehensive servicing.We believe stable aftermarkets, which have historically produced higher gross margins, will continue to drive financial performance for the upcoming quarters.However, softness in business jet, helicopter and freighter revenues, have been hurting the company’s profits. In addition to this, weakness in the global macroeconomic conditions is affecting air travel, adding to the company’s woes. The company is concerned about the commercial transport industry in the coming times as well. These factors can play spoilsport for this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company in the near term.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the industry include Teledyne Technologies Incorporated (TDY  -  Free Report), Rockwell Collins, Inc.

The company’s restructuring efforts over the past five years have allowed it to streamline business operations and optimize growth. Key metrics like revenues, operating income, operating margin and adjusted EPS have materially benefitted from such actions. We expect this trend to continue in the soon-to-be-reported quarter as well.In addition, impressive traction of FLIR Systems’ products, featuring the Lepton® thermal microcamera core, is expected to boost the top line significantly. Since the launch of Lepton technology, the company has seen a 58% compound annual growth rate in total unit volumes. Products launched during the first quarter – including X6900sc SLS, X8500sc SLS cameras and upgraded version of FLIR M-series thermal cameras – are expected to ramp up sales for the quarter under review.Moreover, FLIR Systems’ keen eye for strategic acquisitions is expected to be conducive to its inorganic growth. Previously completed acquisitions, including Armasight, DVTEL and Dynamics, are expected to boost top-line performance. In addition, the company’s diligent CDMQ model is likely to compound the sales of its government and military business. Using this model, FLIR Systems has been able to combat softness in cyclical spending associated with government markets.Other Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some other companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:KLX Inc.

Average volume of shares traded in the last three months is approximately 1.54 million.

Notably, the company’s adjusted earnings per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.3%. Reported earnings also improved 3.1% from the year-ago quarter’s comparable figure.Around the same time, the company completed its B/E Aerospace acquisition for $8.6 billion. Apart from boosting annual revenue outlook for 2017 by more than $8 billion on a year-over-year basis, this buyout led Rockwell Collins to hike its free cash flow guidance for fiscal 2017 by $50 million. Naturally the acquisition raised investors’ optimism on the company’s growth potential.Recently, Rockwell Collins’ management increased its share repurchase authorization by $200 million, for the balance of fiscal year 2017 in to 2018. This is an addition to the company’s previous repurchase agreement announcement in Oct 2016 and brought the total amount of the repurchase program to approximately $285 million.Consequently, the news buoyed investor sentiments and was clearly evident in the shares rally that eventually hit the highest point yesterday.Moreover, Rockwell Collins pays regular dividend to shareholders, which in turn reflects strong cash balance position.

Softness in global macroeconomic conditions is impacting air travel, adding to the company’s woes. The company has some concerns about the commercial transport industry in the coming times as well.

729,TDG,"TransDigm Group Incorporated (TDG  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Nov 9.The company has an excellent earnings surprise history, having beaten estimates in the trailing four quarters, for an average positive surprise of 3%. Last quarter, the company reported earnings of $3.30 per share, reflecting a beat of 5.1%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors to ConsiderTransDigm’s excellent business operation model, which implements value-based operating strategies guided by three value driver concepts, has helped it generate sufficient organic & inorganic growth along with drive operating margin expansion over the past few quarters. The company anticipates business operation model to prove consistently conducive to operating profit and bottom-line growth in the to-be reported quarter as well.TransDigm designs, produces and supplies highly engineered proprietary aerospace components and certain systems with a significant aftermarket presence. For instance, about 90% of the company’s sales are generated by proprietary engineered products, that is, products for which the company owns the intellectual property. We believe this would enhance the revenue generation capacity through all phases of the aerospace cycle, consequently supplementing its financials.Of late, the company’s Defense business has also been performing better than expectations adding to its strength. Moreover, a diversified revenue base reduces the company’s dependence on any particular product, platform or market channel and will continue to play a significant role in maintaining financial performance in the upcoming quarters.However, TransDigm is plagued with negative trends of late, like weaker defense aftermarket orders and soft business jet, helicopter and freighter revenues. This is likely to strain its top-line growth in the fiscal fourth-quarter results.This apart, in recent times the company’s commercial transportation business is suffering from inventory management issues from OEM customers, much of which appears due to rate reductions on wide-body platforms. Further, softness in this market can be traced to a decline in various fleet refurbishment projects. The refurbishment orders are getting rescheduled or delayed, which in turn may also dampen the fourth-quarter results.Further, the company’s interest expenses have been trending upward for the last few quarters. In fact, the company anticipates its debt servicing costs to rise almost 24% year over year to around $600 million in fiscal 2017. Thus, we believe that rising interest expenses will continue to pressure the company’s profits, going forward.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for TransDigm this time around. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESPand a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for the company is +0.33% as the Most Accurate estimate of $3.39 is pegged higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.38. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Transdigm Group Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise Transdigm Group Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise | Transdigm Group Incorporated QuoteZacks Rank: TransDigm has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), which makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Adobe Systems Incorporated (ADBE  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.25 % and a Zacks Rank #1.

730,TDG,"Last week, TransDigm Group Incorporated (TDG  -  Free Report) reported its third-quarter fiscal 2018 results, wherein it continued with its impressive earnings streak for the fifth consecutive quarter. Buoyed by positive industry trends and solid operational execution, the company expects to continue its earnings momentum on the back of complementary acquisitions and steadily growing end markets.We believe, an outstanding performance in the aerospace segment, commercial aftermarket and defense business bode well for the growth for rest of the fiscal year.  Also, the company, which enjoys a robust foothold in an expanding aerospace market which has several growth drivers working in its favor. Read on to find out the key drivers for this company right now.Factors at Play TransDigm’s long-term growth strategy rests on five pillars namely, expanding its proprietary aerospace businesses; executing value-based operating strategy; decentralized organization structure; strategic acquisitions and a diligent capital allocation strategy.An excellent business operation model, which implements value-based operating strategies, has helped the company to generate sufficient organic & inorganic growth and drive operating margin expansion over the past few quarters.   TransDigm’s frequent acquisitions of proprietary aerospace businesses with significant aftermarket content, has helped it secure its place in the core market and grab greater market share. The company’s acquisition integration process focuses on increasing prices, diminishing costs, and winning new business.  During the third quarter, the company announced the acquisition of three add-on aerospace product lines, for a total consideration of roughly $100 million. These acquisitions will add to TransDigm’s product range with their proprietary products that enjoy strong positions on high use of platforms, robust aftermarket content and an excellent reputation.However, on the flip side, the company is currently affected by a growing debt burden and consequent higher interest expenses. Also, the company’s interest expenses have been trending upward for the last few quarters. In fact, TransDigm expects its debt servicing costs to rise almost 24% year over year to around $600 million in fiscal 2017.The company has been suffering from prolonged weakness in some of its major end market, which has thwarted its growth momentum. Softening discretionary retrofits, interior retrofits and weaknesses in jet and helicopter markets have impacted the company’s top-line performance in recent times.Stocks to ConsiderSome other stocks worth considering in the same space include Curtiss-Wright Corporation (CW  -  Free Report), Heico Corporation (HEI  -  Free Report) and Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (HII  -  Free Report).Curtiss-Wright Corporation surpassed earnings estimates every time in the trailing four quarters, resulting in an average surprise of 7.7%.

Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 or 3 (Hold) has a significantly higher chance of beating earnings estimates.Conversely, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.The favorable combination of TransDigm’s Zacks Rank #2 and +1.01% ESP makes us reasonably confident of a positive earnings beat.Growth Factors to ConsiderTransDigm’s fiscal third-quarter top line is likely to benefit from its thriving commercial aftermarket business. It boasts higher margins and comprises only 55% of sales, but makes up over 75% of EBITDA. This translates into consistent revenue generation capacity through all phases of the aerospace cycle.This market is expanding as the majority of aircraft bought during the financial crisis is beginning to age, and requires more frequent and comprehensive servicing. In addition, strategic acquisitions made over the past few years are likely to supplement TransDigm’s sales for the quarter under review. During the quarter, the company acquired three add-on aerospace product lines for roughly $100 million. The product lines mainly comprise proprietary, sole-source products with significant aftermarket content.These acquisitions are expected to boost aftermarket sales further. As a matter of fact, during 2016, TransDigm acquired numerous businesses, including DDC, Breeze-Eastern and Young & Franklin/Tactair. During the fiscal second quarter, the company’s top line rose an impressive 9.6% year over year, as its accretive acquisitions contributed $70 million to sales.This apart, TransDigm’s business operation model, which implements value-based operating strategies, is quite well proven and is likely to boost margins. Encouragingly, this overarching business model has helped the company strengthen its foothold in highly-engineered proprietary aerospace components’ niche markets.Other Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some other companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.JELD-WEN Holding, Inc.

However, the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the past four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 3.04%.Let’s see how things are shaping up at the company prior to this announcement.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Huntington Ingalls is likely to beat earnings this season because it has the right combination of two key ingredients. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat estimates, and Huntington Ingalls has the right mix.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for the company is +4.96%.

Price and EPS Surprise Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. QuoteFactors at PlayBeing the U.S.’ largest military shipbuilder, Huntington Ingalls’ first-quarter 2017 results reported solid performance in shipbuilding, which is expected to reflect in the second-quarter results as well.In fact the company clinched quite a notable contract this quarter, which, in turn, is likely to boost second-quarter revenue growth. In particular, Huntington Ingalls won a modification contract worth $3 billion from the U.S. Navy to procure the detail, design and construction of the Landing Helicopter Assault (LHA) Replacement (LHA(R)) Flight 1 Amphibious Assault Ship (LHA 8).The company’s CVN 72 Lincoln aircraft carrier fleet was being refueled and recapitalized in the beginning of the to-be-reported quarter, while management projected to redeliver it to the Navy by May 2017. We can expect further updates on this process once Huntington Ingalls releases its second-quarter results.On the flip side, management expects no near-term improvement in the company’s relatively weak working capital performance. This might weigh down on the soon-to-be-reported quarter’s outcome.                     The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter earnings is pegged at $2.62, reflecting a 12.93% improvement year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is $1.79 billion, implying a 5.03% increase.Other Stocks that Warrant a LookHere are a few other defense stocks worth considering on the basis of our model which shows that they have the right combination to pull off a beat.Transdigm Group Inc.
