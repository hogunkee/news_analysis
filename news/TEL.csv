1,TEL,"Key Trump administration officials have been confronted at restaurants. Rep. Maxine Waters urged protesters to hound Trump officials at restaurants, gas stations or department stores.Progressive pundits and the liberal media almost daily think up new ways of characterizing President Trump as a Nazi, fascist, tyrant or buffoon. Celebrities openly fantasize about doing harm to Trump.What is behind the unprecedented furor?Just as Barack Obama was not a centrist, neither is Trump. Obama promised to fundamentally transform the United States. Trump pledged to do the same and more — but in the exact opposite direction.The Trump agenda enrages the left in much the same manner that ObamaCare, the Obama tax hikes, Obama's liberal Supreme Court picks and the Iran nuclear deal goaded the right.Yet the current progressive meltdown is about more than just political differences. The outrage is mostly about power — or rather, the utter and unexpected loss of it.In 2009, Obama seemed to usher in a progressive revolution for a generation.Democrats controlled the House. They had a supermajority in the Senate. Obama had a chance to ensure a liberal majority on the Supreme Court for years.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseDemocrats had gained on Republicans at the state and local levels. The media, universities, professional sports, Hollywood and popular culture were all solidly left-wing.A Republican had not won 51% of the popular vote in a presidential election since George H.W. Bush's 1988 defeat of Democrat Michael Dukakis. Before 2016, Republicans had lost the popular vote in five of the previous six presidential elections.And then visions of a generation of progressive grandeur abruptly vanished.Obama left behind a polarized nation. Democrats lost both the House and the Senate. During Obama's tenure, Democrats lost more than 1,000 seats at the state level.Presumptive winner Hillary Clinton blew the 2016 presidential election.Foolishly, Clinton tried to ensure a landslide victory by wasting precious campaign time in unwinnable red states such as Arizona and Georgia. Meanwhile, she too often neglected winnable purple states such as Florida, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, all of which Obama had won in 2008 and 2012. Clinton apparently forgot that the Electoral College, not the popular vote, elects a president.After his election, President Trump did not implode as predicted. By following the Obama precedent of relying on executive orders, Trump began recalibrating everything from immigration enforcement to energy development.Abroad, Trump did what no other Republican president would have dared, bombing ISIS into submission, canceling the Iran deal, seeking to denuclearize North Korea, pulling out of the Paris climate accord, and moving the U.S. embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.The U.S. economy took off with new tax cuts and deregulation. Radical improvement in unemployment, economic growth, and oil and natural gas production created new consumer and business confidence.Despite his frequent crudeness, Trump is inching toward a 50% approval rating in a few polls. That has only made an impotent opposition grow even more furious — both at the other half of the country for supporting Trump, and at a buoyant Trump himself for baiting and ridiculing progressives in the fashion of no prior president.Worse still, much of the loss of progressive power was at least partly self-inflicted.Former Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid foolishly dropped the number of votes needed to overcome a filibuster for executive appointments and most judicial nominations in 2013. That blunder ensured Republicans the chance to remake the Supreme Court when they took over the Senate in 2014.Obama chose not to try to win over his opposition, but to alienate it by veering hard left in his second term. Hillary Clinton foolishly got herself into a number of personal scandals that embarrassed her party and helped lead to her defeat.In reaction to the sudden loss of political power, Democrats would have been wise to run to the center, as did Bill Clinton, who all but ended the era of the Reagan Republicans.They could have dropped their obsession with identity politics and instead attempted to win over blue-collar voters with more inclusive class appeals rather than racial appeals.Instead, Democrats have endlessly replayed the 2016 election. In Groundhog Day fashion, Hillary Clinton repeatedly offered tired excuses for her loss.To progressives, Trump became not an opponent to beaten with a better agenda, but an evil to be destroyed. Moderate Democrats were written off as dense; left-wing fringe elements were praised as clever.Voters in 2016 bristled at redistribution, open borders, bigger government and higher taxes, but progressives are now promising those voters even more of what they didn't want.Furious over the sudden and unexpected loss of power, enraged progressives have so far done almost everything to lose even more of it.And that paradox only leads to more furor.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:The Left Tries To Blame Trump For Their Own Hate MongeringTurns Out, Those Forced Union Dues Did Go To Liberal Advocacy GroupsAfter Its Hard Left Turn, Will Democratic Party Officially Admit It's Socialist?More Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

2,TEL,"Embassy Move: With the opening Monday of the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem, President Trump didn't just keep a promise to Israel. Despite violent Palestinian protests, Trump's move may well reboot peace talks.Trump's decision to relocate the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem does more than merely restate Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital; it is an emphatic declaration of Israel's permanency and its right to exist.Given that many nations around the world don't recognize Israel's right to exist — or, if they do, recognize it only within shrunken borders that would be almost impossible to defend — Trump has put the U.S. squarely behind Israel.The European Union, led by our ""allies"" France and Germany, sought an official rebuke of the U.S. Embassy move. But Hungary, the Czech Republic and Romania, some of the U.S.-friendly ""red states"" of Europe, blocked it.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseSo instead of a painful critique of Trump's move, the EU looks weak, feckless and irresolute — which pretty much sums up the EU, and that includes its ongoing support of the now-defunct Iran nuclear deal.Meanwhile, thousands of Palestinians responded by rioting on the West Bank and in Gaza. Dozens of demonstrators were killed by Israeli forces after they began tossing grenades, bombs and rocks at Israeli troops.Things will likely only get worse on Tuesday, with more violent demonstrations. That's the day that Israelis will celebrate the 70th anniversary of modern Israel's founding as a nation. Palestinians commemorate the same day as the ""Nakba"" — the catastrophe.Yet, as a point of history, the move to Jerusalem should be entirely uncontroversial.For one, the U.S. Congress voted to move the embassy to Jerusalem all the way back in 1995. That law is still on the books, but the move was postponed by successive presidents each year because of the threat of violence and fears that the Palestinians would leave peace talks and riot.Only Trump has fulfilled American law. Moreover, Jerusalem, while claimed by the Palestinians, has never been capital of a Palestinian state or nation. Why? There's never been a Palestinian state or nation, not in all the history of the Mideast.Even as late as 1967, the various Muslim nations and leaders that ruled the land the Romans named Palestina could have declared a sovereign nation there. They didn't. Nor was there any ""Palestinian Liberation Movement"" until after the establishment of Israel.Even so, Trump is looking for ways to make everyone in the Mideast happy. Based on the ecstatic reactions of the Israeli public — Israelis waved Israeli and American flags Monday in the streets while celebrating the opening of the embassy — Israel is quite happy.""What a glorious day. Remember this moment!"" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told an enthusiastic crowd. ""President Trump, by recognizing history, you have made history. All of us are deeply moved. All of us are deeply grateful.""But it doesn't end with the move of an embassy.Adam Kredo of the Washington Free Beacon reports, ""The United States is in the 'late phases' of finalizing its Israeli-Palestinian peace plan that will be presented to both parties for consideration, according to a senior White House official, who discussed progress on the matter ahead of a massive celebration in Israel to open the new U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem.""No word yet on what that plan will contain, but you can be sure that Trump is much more clever and a far savvier street fighter than his leftist critics believe.Is it possible that Trump has outmaneuvered all the Mideast dictators, the supposed Euro-sophisticates, the U.N. do-nothings, and the deep-thinking American foreign-policy wonks in creating the best chance yet for peace in the Mideast?While his critics laughed, Trump has been laying the groundwork for major changes in the Mideast — and possibly the Korean Peninsula as well.With his visit last May to Saudi Arabia, that nation now seems bent on reforms that will bring it closer to the norms of the West. Meanwhile, the Saudis have become de facto allies with Israel in the Mideast, making common cause against their common enemy, Iran.That's why Trump's recent decision to pull the U.S. out of the Iran nuclear deal — a deal that was cobbled together by President Obama, but never approved by the U.S. Senate — is so important.It will not only isolate Iran, but deny it hard currency to continue financing terrorism against Israel by Bashar Assad's Syria and Lebanon's Hezbollah.At any rate, we'll now see how serious the Palestinians are about peace. Trump will soon hand them a generous peace offer, one that will give them a sovereign state and independence.If they say no and engage in yet another murderous intifada, it will be clear that their intent isn't the creation of a Palestinian state so much as it is the destruction of Israel — a plank of the Palestinian movement's founding charter that has never been revoked or removed, by the way.Largely as a result of his embassy move, Trump is being compared to Harry Truman, another president who was underestimated by his political foes. It was Truman who, in 1948, ignored his Ivy League-educated advisors and recognized Israel literally minutes after it declared its statehood.But we liken him more to President Reagan, another president held in contempt by leftist elites. Reagan had the intelligence, foresight and guts to challenge the ""evil empire,"" the USSR, and ultimately bring it to its knees.Today, Trump appears to be doing the same thing to what former President George W. Bush in 2002 called the ""Axis of Evil"" — Iran (by leaving the phony nuclear deal), Iraq (by crushing ISIS) and North Korea (by ending its nuclear weapons program).Not bad for a year and a half of work.

3,TEL,"Nuclear Iran: As North Korea and South Korea unexpectedly talk nuclear peace, Israel's Benjamin Netanyahu has just released an equally unexpected intelligence trove revealing Iran to be a nuclear cheat. Is President Obama's nuclear deal with Iran worth the paper it's written on?It's certainly worth asking the question, after Netanyahu dropped an information bomb on the world's media in the form of voluminous evidence of Iran's repeated efforts to gain a workable nuclear weapon, despite its repeated claims to wanting nuclear technology only for ""peaceful purposes.""Netanyahu's timing isn't accidental. In two weeks, President Trump and leaders of France, U.K. and Germany are set to decide what to do about the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, pushed by President Obama, which almost no one is happy with. Netanyahu is hoping his intelligence will sway the debate and force a unified crackdown on Iran.""This is a terrible deal. It should never have been concluded, and in a few days time, President Trump will decide, will make his decision on what to do with the nuclear deal,"" Netanyahu said in his speech in Tel Aviv, made in his fluent English.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseTrump, for his part, probably doesn't need convincing on the nuclear deal. CIA Director Mike Pompeo recently made a trip to Israel, where he reviewed Netanyahu's intelligence.Netanyahu shared with the U.S. more than 100,000 files and about 180 CDs that Israel retrieved from what Netanyahu called an Iranian ""atomic archive."" He claimed the U.S. could vouch for their authenticity.No surprise, Trump is pushing European allies to make substantive changes in the Iran nuclear deal, to toughen it up.In particular, Trump is upset that some of the tougher provisions go away in time, that inspectors aren't allowed to inspect some military sites, and that other aspects of Iran's weapons and military,  including ballistic missiles programs and its ongoing support of terrorism, are left out entirely from the deal.Netanyahu has come under immediate criticism for his sensational Iran ""dossier."" No one doubts the veracity of the documents. But they note that most of the evidence details nuclear activities that took place years, even decades ago. The Iran nuclear deal, signed in 2015, doesn't cover those earlier activities.But what Netanyahu called ""Project Amad,"" the long-term effort by Iran to ""design, produce and test five warheads, each with 10 kiloton TNT yield for integration in a missile,"" is real. It was never declared under the 2015 nuclear agreement, as required.Here, two points need to be made.First, Iran has claimed for years that it's clean and above-board on its nuclear activities and, as we said, only pursuing nuclear technology for ""peaceful purposes."" These documents completely shatter that lie. So we should believe them now?Second, Iran is already in violation of another nuclear agreement, one that people conveniently forget about: The Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, which Iran signed in 1970 and has never disavowed.So its past efforts to get a bomb, coupled with ongoing evidence its military has never given up its pursuit of a nuclear weapon, make Iran dangerous.The truth is, when the mullahs seized power, they went all in on the idea of developing a nuclear weapon. They conducted experiments and research for all of the Iran-Iraq War, which lasted from 1980 to 1988.The U.S. and International Atomic Energy Agency found violations going all the way back to 1991.In 2002, they were found to have an undeclared uranium enrichment facility at Natanz and a reactor at Arak that could produce plutonium. Both uranium and plutonium can be made into bombs.Based on their aggressive missile program and their stated goal of having a bomb in service of Islam suggests that they are actively building a nuclear weapon.By the way, Iran also signed a chemical weapons non-proliferation treaty in 1997. Today, Iran's closely allied with Syria, and has given both technology and material to Syria's Bashar Assad, who has both made chemical weapons and used them on his own people.Iran shrouds its military nuclear facilities in secrecy and has used immense resources to locate nuclear research and production in hardened facilities underground. These are clear signs of an ongoing nuclear program. Iran's people, pawns in this wicked game, deserve better.This isn't a game. A nuclear weapon in the hands of Iran's fundamentalist leaders would almost surely be used — either by the Iranians themselves, or by a terrorist proxy. The very fact of an Iranian nuclear program is destabilizing of the entire Mideast, since it encourages local rivals — Saudi Arabia and Egypt come to mind — to develop their own bomb programs. Then what?That doesn't even include the fact that Iran has repeatedly threatened Israel with annihilation. And if it gets a nuke, it just might try.The status quo with Obama's failed nuclear deal with Iran is intolerable. It's time to renegotiate the deal, and make it real. Pretending we are stopping Iran from having a nuclear weapon and doing nothing about it is dangerous, just as it was with North Korea.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:To Fix Everything Wrong With Obama's Failed Iran Nuke Deal, Trump Had To Decertify ItTrump Is The Anti-Obama When It Comes To Standing Up To Terrorist-Supporting IranTrump, Merkel And The (Next) Iran DealClick here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

""Cable TV operators will continue to invest, and we expect the (capital expenditure) mix shifts toward network infrastructure and away from set-top boxes, which could enable Casa to grow revenue 17% to 22% in 2018-2019.""The Andover, Mass.-based company, founded in 2003, says it offers a suite of ""software-centric infrastructure solutions that allow cable service providers to deliver voice, video and data services over a single platform at multi-gigabit speeds.""Analysts are singing its praises. That software-focused structure has helped Casa to be ""first to market for most major advances in the cable space in the last 10 years,"" William Blair analyst Jason Ader wrote in his note initiating coverage of the company.Though Casa shares have been choppy — as they are with many IPOs shortly after going public — they have generally moved higher since hitting the market at 13 on Dec. 15. Case in point: shares hit an intraday high of 24.24 in the middle of last week, slipped a bit with the broad market sell-off and then charged ahead again on Monday. Shares had surged nearly 13% to another intraday high of 25.20 Monday and ended the regular session up 7.1% to 23.50.Charter Communications' (CHTR) Time Warner Cable unit is one of Casa's biggest customers, according to Casa's filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission for its initial public offering. Charter made up 36% of its revenue in the first nine months of 2017.But Casa's reach is global. Thanks to an array of customers that includes Rogers Communications (RCI), Liberty Global (LBTYA), Televisa/IZZI Mexico, Vodafone (VOD) and the privately held firms Mediacom and Jupiter Communications, Casa has a presence in North America, Latin America, Europe and Asia-Pacific. In 2016, more than 58% of Casa's revenue came from North America, while Latin America brought in 15%, and its Europe, Middle East and Africa segments combined made up slightly more than 14%. Asia-Pacific revenue took up an eighth of the pie.In all, Casa raked in $316.1 million in revenue and $88.7 million in net income in fiscal 2016 — up 16% and 30.5%, respectively, from the prior year — as outlined in its IPO filing. The bulk of overall revenue, more than 88%, came from sales of its broadband products. It derived the rest from services.The company's growth is ""underpinned by a structural shift in cable operators' network infrastructure, and we expect this transition to continue for a number of years,"" Raymond James' Leopold wrote. He rated Casa outperform with a 23 price target.Leopold believes Casa can benefit from the challenges facing cable operators — namely, subscriber demand for faster speeds and on-demand content.Charter Communications' latest earnings report points to possible tailwinds for Casa, says one analyst.""Despite the possibility for (Charter's) 2018 capex to be flat to down, we are encouraged by the trajectory of spending that impacts Casa, specifically scalable infrastructure,"" Stifel's Patrick Newton wrote in a recent note, as he rated the stock a buy. ""We would expect this to outpace growth in other areas.""Shares are climbing, up more than 70% from its IPO price of 13 a share on Dec. 15. That was notably lower than the originally anticipated pricing of 15-17 a share, but it has risen sharply since then.The stock boasts a Relative Strength rating of 96 so far, indicating strong outperformance.

For one, Casa's main competitors are Cisco Systems (CSCO) and Arris International (ARRS), much bigger players. Cisco's cable broadband business is but a ""rounding error,"" according to Stifel's Newton.But Northland Capital Markets analyst Tim Savageaux points out that Casa has managed to capture ""significant share"" of the $2 billion Converged Cable Access Platform (CCAP) market from both of its main rivals. He estimates that Casa has 23% market share vs. Cisco's 20% and Arris' 50%.Still, analysts see room for growth as Casa ventures into new segments. Its foray into neighboring network transformation markets, and into technologies with names like remote-PHY cable nodes and mobility software ""more than triples"" the company's total addressable market, said William Blair's Ader, adding that he expects new products to ramp up revenue growth through 2019.That said, Casa's move into the wireless market also means it has more rivals, particularly Ericsson (ERIC), Nokia (NOK) and Huawei, which Ader notes have ""deep pockets and substantially more credibility and experience serving wireless customers.""The pursuit of wireless markets is just one part of a multi-pronged growth strategy outlined in Casa's IPO filing. Management also highlighted plans for research investments, selling more products to existing customers, expanding its base and making ""selective acquisitions.""Accumulating capital for possible mergers might be one reason Casa went public, wrote Ader, as it envisions expanding beyond its existing cable customers.""With the industry going through significant and ongoing consolidation, there should be growing opportunities to acquire interesting technology assets that could fit well with Casa's business and broaden its broadband access and aggregation product portfolio,"" he wrote.YOU MAY ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Check Out These Tech Plays If You Like Amazon, Bitcoin, NetflixInternet Of Things Driving MEMS GrowthThe Basics: How To Analyze A Stock's Cup With HandleSurprise!

6,TEL,"Conservative watchdog organization Media Research Center examined the nightly news coverage of President Donald Trump on ABC, NBC and CBS in January and February and concluded that the stories were 91% negative. One consistent narrative, particularly given the recent firing of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, is that ""chaos"" reigns in the Trump White House.Never mind that President Barack Obama went through four secretaries of defense and five chiefs of staff. Obama, goes the narrative, calmly navigated the country during his eight-year tenure. Trump, on the other hand, is reckless, dangerous, undisciplined and out of control.Never mind that the U.S. consumers' confidence is at a level not seen since the early 2000s. Forget the increased value in the stock market, and the appreciation in average home value since the beginning of the Trump presidency. ISIS fighters have been killed or surrendered in the thousands. North Korea's Kim Jong Un has agreed to resume talks about ""denuclearization."" The Middle East did not set itself on fire when Trump agreed to move the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. After nearly 14 months, even many Democrats admit they still, after a year of investigations, see no evidence of ""collusion"" between Russia and the Trump campaign.But things just look ... chaotic.President ""No-Drama Obama"" did indeed successfully push ObamaCare through Congress and signed it into law.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseWhen the House Democrats first revealed what eventually became ObamaCare, the Wall Street Journal called it ""the worst bill ever."" The Journal wrote: ""With spending and debt already at record peacetime levels, the bill creates a new and probably unrepealable middle-class entitlement that is designed to expand over time. Taxes will need to rise precipitously, even as ObamaCare so dramatically expands government control of health care that eventually all medicine will be rationed via politics.""The law did not, as Obama routinely promised, save every family $2,500 a year. ObamaCare did not, as the president insisted, ""bend the cost curve"" down. PolitiFact gave Obama their 2013 ""Lie of the Year"" award for telling the American people, ""If you like your health care plan, you can keep it,"" a guarantee that Obama made even when he knew it was not true.As commander in chief, the no-drama president signed the Iran deal that critics argue puts the world's No. 1 sponsor of terror on a path toward getting a nuclear bomb. Obama's first secretary of defense, Robert Gates, said Obama based the deal on a ""hope that over a 10-year period with the sanctions being lifted that ... they will abandon their ideology, their theology, their revolutionary principles, their meddling in various parts of the region."" Gates called this hope ""unrealistic.""Obama, over the objection of his entire national security team, pulled out all the troops from Iraq. Retired Army Gen. Ray Odierno, a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, later said he believed ISIS could have been dealt with had we left a stay-behind force.On the economy, Obama signed a $787 billion so-called stimulus package, averaged $100 billion in new regulations every single year of his presidency, and promoted the silly, wasteful ""cash for clunkers"" and the equally silly and wasteful ""cash for caulkers.""Obama defenders argue that the recession Obama dealt with was particularly severe. Yet historically, the deeper the recession, the higher the bounce back. Not so under Obama. The recession President Ronald Reagan dealt with was worse, at least by the metrics the Democrats and the media once used until those very metrics made Democrats look bad.Unemployment, for example, under Obama reached 10%. Under Reagan, it reached 10.8%. Inflation was 3.8% the year before Obama took office, but dropped to 1.3% his last year. Under Reagan, it was 13.5% the year before he took office, but dropped to 4.1% his last year. Prime interest rates under Obama, again, were 3.25% when he entered office, and remained low at 3.75% when he left. Under Reagan, prime interest rates climbed as high as 20.5% and dipped as low as 7.5%.It was a Democrat, Jimmy Carter, who, in running against President Gerald Ford in 1976, use the ""misery index."" It was simple. Just add up unemployment, plus inflation. The bigger the number, the worse the economy. Carter pointed out that under Ford, the misery index had gone up. Unfortunately for Carter, when he ran for re-election in 1980, Reagan pointed out that the misery index under Carter had grown even larger. Under Obama, at its worst point, the misery index reached 12.97 in 2011. During Reagan's administration, the misery index was at its worst point when he entered office, at 19.33.Obama, who supposedly governed without drama, delivered the worst recovery since 1949. On the economy and on foreign policy, he signed costly legislation and pushed counterproductive policies.

11,TEL,"In President Donald Trump era, Hollywood has become more political and less entertaining, while Washington, D.C., has become more entertaining and less political. The theme of this year's Golden Globes awards show was ""Time's Up,"" the movement to salute the women who have come forward to tell their stories of sexual abuse, assault or harassment in the workplace.XActress Reese Witherspoon said, ""I want to thank everyone who broke their silence this year and spoke up about abuse and harassment. You are so brave. ... So people out there who are feeling silenced by harassment, discrimination, abuse: Time is up. We see you, we hear you, and we will tell your stories.""But for years women have publicly told their stories of sexual abuse and rape by Bill Clinton. One alleged rape survivor, Juanita Broaddrick, claims that Hillary Clinton attempted to verbally threaten her into silence about two weeks after Broaddrick's alleged rape by Bill Clinton. The Hollywood community raised millions of dollars for the Clintons, despite Broaddrick's accusation and the accusations of sexual harassment and battery by Paula Jones and Kathleen Willey. It's hard to get much more public than telling your story on ""60 Minutes"" and ""Dateline NBC,"" as did Willey and Broaddrick, respectively.
"
12,TEL,"Yet this did not disturb the Hollywood community.Nor is the ""Time's Up"" Hollywood community bothered by how it treats conservative females. HBO's Bill Maher, who contributed $1 million to a Democratic super political action committee, called former Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin both the C-word and a ""dumb t---"" (a derisive slang word for female genitalia). He also referred to Palin and former Minnesota congresswoman Michele Bachmann, who ran as a Republican presidential candidate in 2012, as ""two bimbos."" If any guests, female or male, canceled appearances or refused to appear on Maher's show until he apologized for his vulgar insults of conservative woman, it did not make news.In three hours of the Golden Globes' celebration of the empowerment of women, neither host Seth Meyers nor Oprah Winfrey, who was given a special award for ""outstanding contributions to the world of entertainment,"" nor any presenter or winner found time to say something, anything, about the abuse and oppression of women in the Muslim and Arab world. Not one word.Actress Debra Messing, on the red carpet before the show started, made it clear that ""Time's Up"" meant ""equal pay."" She said: ""Time is up. We want diversity. We want intersectional gender parity, we want equal pay."" Messing told the E! host who was interviewing her: ""I was so shocked to hear that E! doesn't believe in paying their female co-hosts the same as their male co-hosts. ... We want people to start having this conversation that women are just as valuable as men. Fifteen million dollars has been raised for funds for advocacy and legal representation for women. ... This is not about Hollywood. This is about every woman in every industry globally. As someone in this industry, we need equal representation. We want 50/50 by 2020. And within that 50%, 30% women of color.""No Hidden Agenda: Get News From A Pro-Free Market, Pro-Growth PerspectiveReally? So until and unless every industry is 50% female and 30% of those women of color, we suffer from racial and sex discrimination? So 50% of physicists must be female and 30% of them women of color? Secretaries? Ditch diggers? Supermodels? NBA players? Ballerinas?Actress Natalie Portman, in announcing the nominees for best director, cheapened the award and simultaneously took a swipe at men, saying, ""And here are the all-male nominees."" How do you think that made the winner, Guillermo del Toro, feel? After all, he only won the award, implied Portman, against a sexist fraternity that shuts out more-deserving women.How a little perspective on this ""female empowerment"" business? There are more women in college then men. In recent years, an average of 50% of the entering medical school and law school classes are female. And young women out-earn young men. When you examine the apples to apples data, comparing women with the same level and type of education and work experience to their male counterparts, there's virtually no difference in the incomes of these similarly situated men and women.One more thing about the Golden Globes show and the attendees' hostility toward President Trump. Hollywood is an industry heavily represented by Jews. It is an industry that gave us masterpieces like ""Schindler's List."" Yet not one person on Sunday night, Jew or gentile, gave Trump an ""Atta boy"" for moving our embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, something even Barack Obama promised but failed to do.Will one, just one, A-list actor or actress say something positive about President Donald Trump? What does it say about Hollywood's alleged open-mindedness and tolerance that such a thing would be a career-ending act of courage? On the other hand, Sharon Stone looked great. And — to avoid accusations of sexism — so did Tom Hanks.RELATED:Oprah And The Unbearable Lightness Of DemocratsMedia Enablers Protected Democratic Predators For YearsClick here for more†Commentary and Opinion†from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

13,TEL,"About a year into President Trump's first term, the jury for much of the country and for most of the major media has returned its verdict: Trump is a failure. Trump is incompetent. Trump cannot lead. Trump has no legislative victories. Even former President Carter said he had never seen a president so maligned in the media. Meanwhile former President Obama all but compared Trump to Hitler.XTrump endures a nightly beating from the cast of late-night comedians who take turns calling Trump racist, sexist, dumb, inarticulate, overweight, overwrought and, of course, clueless. His reported consumption of 12 Diet Cokes per day provided material for the comics' writers. Nothing seems to be off limits, not even first lady Melania's choice of White House Christmas décor.Based on the beating Trump endures daily from a hostile ""news"" media, coupled with the nightly drubbing at the hands of Stephen Colbert, Jimmy Fallon, Jimmy Kimmel et al., one could reasonably assume that Trump's approval ratings must be among the worst any leader could have.Trump got pounded by much of the left for his decision to move the American embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Never mind every president since 1995 has promised to do so.Trump got hammered for backing Judge Roy Moore in the Alabama Senate race. Trump first backed Moore's Republican primary opponent. When Moore won, Trumped switched his support to him. But when several allegations came out about Moore's alleged sexual misconduct, Trump called on him to drop out ""if the allegations are true."" The Republican National Committee pulled its endorsement and funding. Trump then did a 180, presumably fearing the loss of a Republican Senate vote in a chamber that is only 52-48 Republican versus Democrat.Democrats used the allegations against Moore to remind voters of the ""Access Hollywood"" tape in which Trump made crude remarks about women and fame.When the Rasmussen poll put Trump's approval rating at 46% a month ago, comedian Jimmy Fallon quipped: ""Did you see this? Trump just went on Twitter and bragged about a poll showing that he has a 46% approval rating. Really? That's like posting a math quiz on the fridge where you got a D-plus.""No Hidden Agenda: Get News From A Pro-Free Market, Pro-Growth PerspectiveBut how many Trump haters know that his ""D-plus"" is still better than the grades of leaders of other important countries?Take Germany's internationally respected Chancellor Angela Merkel, the leader of her party since 2000 and the head of the federal government since 2005. According to The Times of London, the approval number for her and her party just three weeks ago was an all-time low of 29.2%: ""Angela Merkel's poll ratings fell to an all-time low yesterday after the breakdown of talks on forming a coalition government as the German president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, stepped up efforts to avoid new elections.""How about France's President Emmanuel Macron? According to the U.K.'s Daily Express headline in October, ""Emmanuel Macron Loses France's Trust: Poll Shows Majority Questioned Have No Faith in Him."" The Express reported: ""The majority of French people — 54% — 'do not trust the head of state to fix the country's social and economic problems,' according to the Elabe poll for Radio Classique and Les Echos. ... His current approval ratings, however, pale in comparison to his high postelection ratings, when some 60% of French voters expressed satisfaction with their new leader.""Recall the zeal with which some in the U.S. media greeted Macron's election. Time magazine reported: ""An untested whizkid has shot to power as President of France in his very first election campaign, crumpling older, hard-bitten veterans in his wake. ... Aged just 39, Macron is France's youngest leader since the famed French emperor Napoleon Bonaparte, who took power at age 35.""Then there's Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May. The Telegraph reported last month on a poll by ORB International: ""It shows that two in three people disapprove of the way the Brexit negotiations are being handled. ... Some 44% of the public backed her at the start of June, but after she lost the Conservatives' parliamentary majority in a snap election that she called, the figure dropped to 34%. It is now just 26%.""Finally, look at the poll numbers of Canada's Justin Trudeau. According to Bloomberg Businessweek, his numbers are down significantly from when he was elected: ""Two years into Trudeau's first term, a polling aggregator run by the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. shows his support at 37.9%, down eight points from a year ago — still strong in Canada's three-party system.""Yes, Trump's numbers are low — for now. But other leaders on the world stage are doing worse, in some instances far worse. So before much of the country and the media write Trump off as a failure, how about we try just a little perspective?RELATED:IBD/TIPP PollIBD/TIPP Poll: Presidential Approval, Direction Of CountryMore Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

15,TEL,"U.S. stocks were little changed in midday action Wednesday, despite President Trump's disruptive plan regarding Jerusalem and a Senate committee's backing of a partial rollback in Dodd-Frank.X The Nasdaq crept 0.1% higher, while the S&P 500 was just barely above flat. The blue chip Dow Jones industrial average added 0.1%, while the small cap Russell 2000 fell 0.1%.Volume in the stock market today was below the previous session's pace.Trump is expected to announce that the U.S. is recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital. This would make the U.S. the first country to do so. The U.S. would then eventually move its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.On a quieter note, the U.S. Senate Banking Committee approved a bipartisan rollback to parts of the Dodd-Frank law in a 16-7 vote Tuesday. Four Democrats on the panel voted with the majority. The rollback has the support of nine Democrats in the Senate, and initial support from Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen and Yellen's replacement Jerome Powell.The bipartisan legislation doesn't involve a full repeal.The bill would raise the trigger for more intense regulation of financial firms from the current $50 billion in assets to $250 billion, thus easing the regulatory burden on smaller financial institutions. This would benefit firms such as Charles Schwab (SCHW), which rose five sessions in a row before pulling back Tuesday and so far Wednesday; SunTrust Banks (STI), which rose six sessions in a row before its pullback; and American Express (AXP), which advanced six sessions in a row, going into Wednesday's session.Major money centers such as Wells Fargo (WFC), Bank of America (BAC) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) would not get a break. At midday, all three were down slightly.Bank stocks, including the big players, have benefited on the belief that the Federal Reserve will crank interest rates at least a quarter point after the Fed meets Dec. 12-13. CME Group's FedWatch Tool estimates the odds of a rate hike at 100%. The only difference is between those who expect a quarter-point hike (90.2%) and those who see a half-point increase (9.8%).A half-point increase would be a bold move, and the Ben Bernanke/Janet Yellen Fed isn't known for boldness.In recent sessions, the chipmakers, chip designers and chip-equipment makers have fallen 9% to 14% off their highs. As of Tuesday's close, the chip sector fell to No. 8 among 33 sectors — its worst ranking of the year.Speculation among market watchers swirls around two views: Either chip stocks will offer a buying opportunity when they stop falling and rebound or their leadership position will be turned over to some other sector such as banks and financials.Among IBD's 197 industry groups, solar and steel producers led the upside. Oil-related stocks led the downside.The IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index, a gauge of consumer confidence, decreased in December. The overall reading dropped to 51.9 from 53.6 in November.""It's worth noting that the tax reform package President Trump championed and is nearing passage hasn't led to a jump in optimism,"" said Terry Jones, IBD's commentary editor.Despite the drop in December, the optimism gauge remains in positive territory. The index has held above the neutral level of 50 for 15 months in a row.RELATED:Which Stocks Are Showing Rising Relative Strength?New Highs: Are Stocks Pivoting To New Leadership?

16,TEL,"Mideast: Despite a firestorm of protests, President Trump says he will recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital and eventually move the U.S. embassy there from Tel Aviv. Consider it another Trump promise kept.Presidents of both parties have promised for years to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital. Yet, somehow complications inevitably arose — ""Europe"" claimed it would ""complicate"" peace talks, or the Palestinians said it would make peace impossible, or radical Islamists threatened unrest and terrorism by the ""Arab Street"" in response to the provocation.No Hidden Agenda: Get News From A Pro-Free Market, Pro-Growth PerspectiveSo no president, Democrat or Republican, ever truly, officially recognized Israel's capital for what it plainly was: the legitimate capital of a nation on whose territory it sits.As we said, the U.S. has often pledged its support for moving the embassy to Israel's true capital before. In 1995, President Bill Clinton even signed the Jerusalem Embassy Relocation Act, which not only recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital but committed the U.S. to move its embassy.X But a loophole in the law let U.S. presidents issue ""waivers"" of the bill every six months. In each presidency since then, including two Bushes and one Obama, waivers were issued and nothing ever did happen.Until Trump, that is.But isn't this a ""radical"" or unexpected move, as some now assert? No. As recently as last June, the U.S. Senate voted 90 to zero to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital. To say there should be bipartisan support for Trump's action is an understatement.The facts are plain: Jerusalem was Israel's capital 3,000 years ago, before its people were scattered by various foreign regimes — ranging from the Babylonians to the Romans to the Muslim Arabs and, much later, the Ottoman Empire — in the Jewish diaspora.When Israel was re-established in 1948, Jerusalem was again its capital. And it's been so ever since.As for the Palestinians, they won't even recognize Israel's right to exist — even though there has never been an independent state called Palestine. This latter fact makes Palestinian claims to sovereignty over parts of Jerusalem highly problematic, to say the least.But why is preventing Jerusalem from being Israel's capital such a big deal?Because getting rid of the state of Israel is at the heart of both the Palestinians' founding charter and their current law. Delegitimizing Israel's control of Jerusalem is merely a step in that process.Its foes must now deal with the uncomfortable fact that Jerusalem is Israel's functioning capital today, with its legislature, its high court and its prime minister all residing there. And it's unquestionably the center of the nation's religious life.The Palestinians have cynically used the ancient capital of Israel as a political bargaining chip for years. Their claim is that Jerusalem's status can only be determined in talks between Israel and the Palestinians as part of a ""two-state"" solution of the Israeli-Palestinian dispute.And they have support. As the BBC noted Wednesday, Mideast ""leaders"" now ""warn"" darkly about what might happen as a result of Trump's move:Meanwhile, BBC also reports that ""Ismail Haniya, the chief of the Islamist Hamas group that runs Gaza, said a shift of the embassy and recognition of Jerusalem as the Israeli capital would cross 'every red line.' ""For the record, Hamas is a terrorist group, as is Fatah. They run ""Palestine"" — the West Bank and Gaza — with iron fists. So if violence breaks out, it's because they condone it and encourage it.It will be their fault, and they will once again show why a Palestinian state dedicated to the annihilation of its neighbor Israel would be a very bad idea.That Jerusalem was both the sacred and political capital of Israel is an historical fact and beyond dispute. That it was never the capital of Palestine is also beyond dispute, given that Palestine was never a sovereign nation.The U.S. has appeased the Palestinians for decades on the issue of recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, but it has achieved nothing. Every time peace seems close, a new Palestinian intifada is declared, violence explodes, and hopes of a lasting deal are dashed.Well, enough.The extreme reaction to Trump's move is really just an attempt to test his mettle. But Trump's position has been clear from the start and is absolutely fair.As President Trump said Wednesday, ""We are not taking a position of any final status issues, including the specific boundaries of the Israeli sovereignty in Jerusalem, or the resolution of contested borders. Those questions are up to the parties involved.""The message: It's put-up or shut-up time for the Palestinians.Once again, despite unhinged critics, Trump is only keeping America's promises — on Jerusalem as on so many other things. Too bad other politicians won't do the same.RELATED:Cutting Off UNESCO: Nice Start, Now How About The Rest Of The Israel-Hating U.N.? In The Mideast, Trump Just Pushed A Real 'Reset Button' Trump Can Reverse Obama's Betrayal Of Israel By Defunding The U.N.Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

21,TEL,"What a difference a week makes. On May 19, President Donald Trump took off in Air Force One for the Middle East and Europe. He left behind a Washington and a nation buzzing about his firing of FBI Director James Comey, the multiple reasons he had given for doing so, the meeting he'd had with the Russian foreign minister a day later and his statement that Comey is a ""nut job.""The I-word — impeachment — was in the air as Democrats and mainstream media muttered that he was obstructing justice by attempting to throttle investigation of collusion with the Russians. Brainy and quirky conservative New York Times columnist Ross Douthat argued that the Trump Cabinet should remove him from office as unfit under the 25th Amendment.So it has been something of a surprise to see the Trump who emerged from Air Force One in Riyadh behaving quite differently, like a competent American president.In Saudi Arabia, he delivered a sobering speech that invites comparison with Barack Obama's Cairo address to the Muslim world almost exactly eight years ago.Obama apologized for the misdeeds of the West, ranging from the Crusades a millennium ago to 19th- and 20th-century colonialism to the overthrow of the Mosaddegh regime in Iran eight years before he was born. Trump apologized for nothing.Instead, before an assembly of leaders from about 50 Muslim-majority nations, Trump denounced in no uncertain terms Islamic extremism and Islamic terror groups and insisted that Muslims must ""drive them out"" of their places of worship, communities and ""holy land.""Trump also announced a $110 billion arms sale to Saudi Arabia and denounced Iran for fueling ""the fires of sectarian conflict and terror."" This presumably delighted the Saudis and the leaders of Egypt, Jordan and the Persian Gulf States, who were dismayed at Obama's eight-year tilt toward Iran.That started with his cold indifference to the mullah regime's squashing of the 2009 protests and culminated in the 2015 nuclear agreement, which, as Obama advisor Ben Rhodes confessed to The New York Times Magazine, was pushed through with a false ""narrative"" and a compliant media ""echo chamber.""At best, the deal delayed Iran's acquisition of nuclear arms; it has not changed Iran's terrorist-supporting behavior as Obama apparently hoped. Trump's turn to an explicitly anti-Iran policy may turn out better.Trump then journeyed to Israel — on the first scheduled nonstop flight from Riyadh to Tel Aviv in history — and became the first sitting president to visit the Western Wall. In Bethlehem, at the side of Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas, he condemned the ""evil losers"" responsible for the bombing of a concert hall in Manchester, England. In Vatican City, emerging from an apparently amicable meeting with Pope Francis, Trump said, ""I won't forget what you said.""The next stops, as this is written, are a NATO meeting in Brussels and a G-7 meeting in Taormina, Sicily. It's possible that Trump will commit some dreadful faux pas along the way. But so far, he has been behaving presidentially.That may come as a surprise to critics. New York Times editorialists have whined that he is forsaking the policies of his two immediate predecessors, but they haven't fully explained why those policies should be followed. In fact, Trump has not gone so far as his campaign rhetoric sometimes suggested.The U.S. Embassy remains in Tel Aviv, not Jerusalem; the Iranian nuclear deal has not been renounced; America remains a signer of the Paris climate declaration. John Bolton complained in The Wall Street Journal that Trump has failed to make changes abroad, just as Ann Coulter is complaining that he is failing to build the wall along our southern border.My tentative conclusion is that Trump is more of a conventional president than he promised or than his critics fear. His early morning tweets are unnerving; his propensity for unrehearsed ad-libs is potentially dangerous; his taste in interior decoration is appalling.But the notion that he won the presidency through collusion with Russia is implausible and is wholly without evidence. His odd campaign statements about Vladimir Putin and Russia were known to voters, and Hillary Clinton made intelligent criticism of them in the debates.Democrats and journalists assuming that further investigations will lead to impeachment are pursuing what movie director Alfred Hitchcock called a MacGuffin — something a movie's characters are pursuing that is, to quote Wikipedia, ""typically unimportant to the overall plot.""Now the question is whether Donald Trump, after acting like a president abroad, can start doing so at home.

23,TEL,"On April 5, The New York Times published an op-ed by retired Army Gen. Stanley McChrystal headlined ""Save PBS. It Makes Us Safer."" McChrystal now runs a big lobbying firm, so that may be why he cares so much — he's a gun for hire.So how does the general think PBS makes us safer? And from what are we safer? The answer: commercialism. Parents like his son and daughter-in-law ""are busy in the morning and busy at night,"" he says. ""They want to protect their children from over-commercialized content.""This argument is bizarre — actually, let's call it what it is: disingenuous — at a time when ""Sesame Street,"" which was used to illustrate this article online, of course, is now an HBO property.""Sesame Street"" is the embodiment of the need for public funding? This is nonsense. Big Bird generates a fortune in the private sector. When you search ""Sesame Street"" under ""all departments"" on the Amazon website, it produces 39,276 results.McChrystal concluded that the people defunding PBS are waging a war on civil society, asking, ""Why then would we degrade or destroy an institution that binds us together?""Some lobbyists will say anything. We hope he's well-compensated for writing those words. He's also featured in a video made by the lobbying group America's Public Television Stations claiming that public media ""gets to the center"" and is the ""adult in the room"" of the news business.So what is it that binds us together anyway? Justin Haskins reports at TheBlaze that the PBS LearningMedia website has a lesson plan for grades nine through 12 titled ""Dying to be a Martyr."" The lesson ""investigates conflict in the Middle East using interviews with young would-be suicide bombers."" Video interviews shown in the class were done in 2004.First, there's 18-year-old Mohanned Abu Tayyoun, a Palestinian ""who entered Israel carrying a bag of explosives with the intention of carrying out a suicide bombing."" But he wavered and ""returned home without carrying out the mission.""Tayyoun is interviewed from a jail cell in Israel about why he wanted to be a suicide bomber. He said: ""Martyrdom leads us to God. I don't want this life. When you become a martyr, your prize for carrying out the operation is going to heaven. ... We Palestinians prefer to die, just kill ourselves, rather than live this worthless life. Our life's worthless. We are hollow bodies living a pointless life. Israelis enjoy their life. They go out at night. They have cafes and nightclubs. They travel all over the world. They go to America and Britain. We can't even leave Palestine.""Teachers are told: ""Check for understanding by asking students to respond to the focus question. (Mohanned feels he would rather die and by a martyr than live his life, sees his life as hollow — in contrast he sees Israelis as happy, going out, having fun, traveling.) Ask your students why Mohanned may feel that way.""In other words, feel his pain. We'd rather ask why PBS feels it can abuse the American taxpayer this way.There's more. Students watch 25-year-old Majdi Amer, who built a bomb and prepared a suicide bomber for a bus attack in Haifa, Israel, ""that killed 17 people and wounded 50"" in March 2003.Amer is asked why he believes it's acceptable to kill women and children. He says: ""If the Israelis kill a child in Gaza, I'm ready to kill one in Tel Aviv. If they destroy houses in Gaza, I'll do it in Tel Aviv. If they give me security in my land, then there's no problem.""Teachers are then tasked to explore ""how Majdi and Mohanned's opinions differ from one another, even though they are both Palestinians involved in suicide bombing plots."" The lesson planners at PBS have no instructions to denounce suicide bombing or radical Islam. None.The website lists JPMorgan Chase and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting as the funders. That means you are paying for this.Dear General McChrystal: PBS isn't ""making us safer"" by promoting suicide bombers like the ones that killed your soldiers in Afghanistan.RELATED:Big Bird Is Rich, So Why Does He Need Taxpayer Money?

25,TEL,"Verizon Communications (VZ) named a former chief executive of wireless gear maker Ericsson (ERIC) as its executive VP for network and technology as it readies 5G technology for deployment.Hans Vestberg, who served for six years as Sweden-based Ericsson's CEO, will be responsible for ""further developing the architecture of Verizon's fiber-centric networks,"" the company said in a news release.Vestberg's network and technology operation will ""focus on delivering seamless network experiences for customers, whether on Wi-Fi, fiber, 4G, 5G or future technologies,"" Verizon said.In other management moves, Verizon named Marni Walden as executive VP for media and telematics, and John Stratton as executive VP for customer and product operations.Walden's responsibilities will include AOL, purchased in 2015, and Yahoo. Verizon's deal to acquire Yahoo's internet and advertising business is expected to close shortly. Stratton earlier ran Verizon Wireless as well as Verizon's global enterprise and consumer wireline units.Vestberg will move to the U.S. this spring, Verizon said. Vestberg will report to Verizon Chairman and CEO Lowell McAdam.IBD'S TAKE: Verizon stock has dropped 8% in 2017 and is nowhere near a technical buy point of 57.05. Verizon stock shined in 2016 as investors sought high-dividend paying stocks. Check out other options at IBD's Income Investor.Vestberg is the second telecom executive from Europe that Verizon has recently brought in.Verizon in August hired Ronan Dunne, a veteran of the British mobile phone wars, to run its wireless business. Ronan Dunne was formerly head of Telefonica's (TEF) British unit, branded as O2.Verizon in 2014 bought out Vodafone Group's 45% stake in their wireless joint venture, Verizon Wireless, for $130 billion.Verizon shares fell 0.6% to 48.75 on the stock market today.RELATED:It's Official: AT&T Wins Pact For FirstNet Public Safety NetworkT-Mobile, Comcast May Win In Surprise Auction Spectrum Grab: UBS

26,TEL,"At seven o'clock on a recent morning, Simon Collins was at his office in New York making a video call to China. The fashion consultant was about to launch into his plans for an upcoming conference he's organizing before his overseas colleague interrupted: ""Are you in your grandmother's dining room?""He was actually at Public, a dimly lit restaurant with dark oak tables and vintage decor located in New York City's trendy Nolita neighborhood. The Michelin-star eatery undergoes a transformation each morning into a co-working space for freelancers and other professionals. A network of five such restaurant-office hybrids is run by a local startup called Spacious.com, which is finding a niche among people looking for a place to work that's cheaper than WeWork but quieter and more reliable than a Starbucks.Spacious is one of several new businesses with an unusual twist on co-working. The model of converting dining rooms or bars into shared offices is attractive to restaurant owners because it offers a new source of revenue during the workday, when their spaces are usually left dormant. It's especially appealing to the food-service industry, which has seen its already-low margins squeezed. ""Walking by a coffee shop and seeing everybody piled on top of each other, and seeing a beautiful empty restaurant next door — it just seemed to be a natural fit,"" said Preston Pesek, co-founder and CEO of Spacious.Co-working spaces, where people rent desks and offices alongside other freelance or satellite workers, have become a global sensation, led by WeWork. The New York-based company was valued at more than $17 billion last month after an investment from SoftBank Group. WeWork provides members with free snacks and access to in-office beer kegs. It has 162 office locations in 41 cities around the world.WeWork's hometown is one of the world's co-working capitals. Commercial real estate devoted to co-working in New York City has grown fivefold in the past five years, according to Jonathan Mazur, managing director at real estate firm Newmark Grubb Knight Frank. The city, with its high concentration of restaurants and bars, offers plenty of options for Spacious and its rivals, such as WorkEatPlay and KettleSpace.But similar businesses are starting up in Austin, Texas, and Tel Aviv. They typically don't offer as many perks as WeWork but provide members with speedy Wi-Fi, printers, office supplies and coffee. Subscriptions range from $95 to $110 a month, which is about half the cost of a desk at WeWork.Daniel Rubin, CEO of Israel's Pub Hub, said he's opened one location and is scouting more than a dozen bars in the country's tech hub of Tel Aviv. But he said finding one that can make itself look presentable to working professionals every morning is a challenge: ""Not every bar is great for co-working.""Working someplace with a fully stocked bar has its perks. Shaina Forman, a 28-year-old brand strategist, shuts her laptop at 5 p.m. when DBGB Kitchen and Bar on Manhattan's Lower East Side opens to the public. Then she'll sometimes partake in the $1 oysters and drink specials. ""We get a text at the end of the day saying it's time for happy hour,"" she said.Because Spacious uses mostly high-end restaurants, it doesn't have to worry about cleaning up a mess from the night before. Cheryl Clements, who founded and runs a crowdfunding website called PieShell that's aimed at food and beverage entrepreneurs, said Spacious allows her to get a rare taste of fine dining, even if it's during off-hours. She often works from La Sirena in Chelsea, which is owned by celebrity chef Mario Batali. ""You walk out of here and go to the washroom, and the orange Croc wonder is standing there doing a commercial, and you're like, 'Oh, yeah. Hi!' "" Clements said.Collins, the fashion consultant, also likes the upscale digs, despite the mockery from his Chinese colleague. As Collins told him over video chat recently, the vibe helps him portray a certain status to clients. ""This is a really cool restaurant downtown that people struggle to get into, and we get in early,"" he said. ""I filmed an interview with a Chinese network in the wine room at Public. It's a long, beautiful room filled with wine.""But due to the high turnover in the restaurant industry, your favorite location may not stick around forever. Collins was bummed to learn recently that Public lost its lease and will shut down in June. He'll relocate to La Sirena or another Spacious location, he said: ""Always sad to see a good restaurant go though.""MORE ABOUT THE REAL ESTATE MARKET:

The further evidence of a strengthening economy likely boosts the chance of a nominal hike in interest rates in December, and investors are deciding to take a more defensive stance this week. Wall Street was also spooked by weak export data out of China.The Nasdaq composite fell 1.3%, hurt by sharp drops in big-cap techs, before rebounding a bit. The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrials were both down around 0.8% to 0.9%. Small caps also saw fierce selling. The S&P SmallCap 600 and the Russell 2000 both sank, dropping more than 1.3% initially before shaving their losses a tad.The Dow utility average rallied more than 0.5%. It's a relatively weak rebound, though, considering that in the prior two weeks the index lost more than a combined 7% in value and barreled below both its 10-week and 40-week moving averages (please see a weekly chart at Marketsmith.com).The Nasdaq is showing further weakness after reversing from small gains and closing slightly below its 50-day moving average on Wednesday. On Tuesday, IBD changed the current outlook for the market to ""uptrend under pressure"" due to an escalation in heavy institutional selling in recent weeks.On Monday, the Nasdaq slid 1.5% in higher volume, a classic distribution day in which fund managers actively took profits.

58,TEL,"Chip gear maker Applied Materials (AMAT) saw its stock hit a 16-year high Thursday following positive response to the company's analyst day presentations.Applied Materials stock climbed intraday as high as a 16-year-best 31.06 on the stock market today. But the stock closed down 0.9% at 30.28. Applied Materials reached its all-time high of 57.50 in April 2000 at the peak of the dot-com boom.Pacific Crest Securities analyst Weston Twigg said Applied offered a ""compelling case for growth"" at its analyst event. He reiterated his overweight rating on the stock and raised his price target to 35 from 33.IBD'S TAKE: Applied Materials is No. 1 in IBD's Electronics-Semiconductor Equipment industry group and sports a best-possible IBD Composite Rating of 99. It also is on the IBD 50 list of superior stocks.""We remain positive on AMAT, which should continue to gain share and expand its served markets as its product development engine keeps producing hits,"" Twigg said in a research report Wednesday. ""We believe that AMAT is the best-positioned equipment company over the next three years in both semiconductors and display.""Credit Suisse analyst Farhan Ahmad said Applied Materials set conservative targets, especially in wafer fab equipment, at its analyst day. But rivals Lam Research (LRCX) and TE Connectivity (TEL) are targeting similar opportunities, such as in patterning and 3D Nand chip equipment, he said.Ahmad reiterated his outperform rating on Applied Materials stock, with a price target of 34.Applied Materials sees long-term opportunities in OLED display manufacturing, fueled by smartphones, VR headsets and televisions; and chips for augmented reality hardware and smart vehicles.Applied's analyst event in New York City highlighted the company's momentum with sustainable growth, Needham analyst Edwin Mok said in a report. He reiterated his buy rating on AMAT with a price target of 34.""We saw the presentation as a 'victory lap' after several years of management's efforts to reposition AMAT's strategy and operating model to drive share gains in multiple areas and (market) expansions,"" Mok said.
"
59,TEL,"More positive comments were issued Monday on reports that Qualcomm (QCOM) is looking to acquire NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) for at least $30 billion, or about $90 a share.RBC Capital Markets analyst Amit Daryanani raised his price target on Qualcomm to 70 from 59. He maintained a sector-perform rating but upped his price target to reflect the increased potential for a more diversified company with higher earnings per share and free cash flows that the deal could generate.Dow Jones said a deal could be struck in the next two to three months. It would create the second-largest chip company by revenue after Intel (INTC). Qualcomm is the leading supplier of cellphone chip sets. NXP makes high-performance mixed-signal processors for communications, security, automotive and industrial applications. Among its biggest customers are Apple (AAPL), Bosch, Ericsson (ERIC), Samsung and Nokia (NOK).""While the NXP transaction is certainly much larger vs. what investors had contemplated,"" Daryanani said in a research note, ""we think it offers Qualcomm with several unique assets to further enable diversity away from their 90% mobility exposure.""UBS analyst Stephen Chin also views the NXP deal positively.""If Qualcomm were to acquire NXP, we estimate sales exposure to the smartphone market would drop from about 90% of its current total to 68% overall,"" Chin wrote.Chin has a neutral rating on Qualcomm and a price target of 59. Assuming a deal is struck, Chin estimates a possible Qualcomm price target of 80, due to stronger revenue diversity.Qualcomm stock slid 2% to 67.11 on the stock market today. Qualcomm jumped 8% over two days last week as word of the possible deal was first revealed. NXP stock rose 0.7% to 102.76 on Monday. The stock is up 25% since reports of merger talks broke.IBD'S TAKE: Qualcomm sports an IBD Composite Rating of 92, meaning it has outperformed 92% of stocks over the past year based on a select group of IBD metrics. It also has a solid Accumulation/Distribution Rating of B, indicating that institutional investors have been buying the stock.Last week, investment bank Mizuho raised its rating on Qualcomm stock to buy from neutral, with a price target of 75. Cowen hiked its price target on Qualcomm to 74 from 62 and reiterated its outperform rating.RELATED:NXP Hires Adviser To Field Offers As Qualcomm Circles

60,TEL,"Shares of NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) soared Thursday on a report that the company might be acquired by Qualcomm (QCOM).NXP stock shot up as much as 19% on the stock market today, matching a 14-month high of 98.09, and ended the day up 17%, at 96.12. Qualcomm stock rose 6%, to 67.23.Dow Jones said a deal could be struck in the next two to three months. NXP Semiconductors has a market cap of more than $30 billion.San Diego-based Qualcomm has a market value of about $99 billion.A spokesman for NXP said it is company policy to never comment on rumors or speculation. Qualcomm didn't immediately return a request for comment.IBD'S TAKE: Big mergers often come with big challenges, and many never pan out. For an example of huge deal that so far is working out, look no further than the latest IBD 50 ranking of top-performing stocks over the past 52 weeks. Broadcom, a product of a merger completed early this year between Broadcom and Avago, resides at No. 46. More than that, Broadcom also is among IBD's Sector Leaders.Headquartered in the Netherlands, NXP makes high-performance mixed-signal processors for communications, security, automotive and industrial applications. Among its biggest customers are Apple (AAPL), Bosch, Ericsson (ERIC), Huawei, Hyundai, Nokia (NOK) and Samsung.If the NXP-Qualcomm merger occurs, it would be part of a wave of consolidation occurring in the chip sector.In May, disk drive maker Western Digital completed its $19 billion acquisition of flash chip company SanDisk. On Feb. 1, the biggest chip merger ever -- biggest merger of two tech companies ever -- was completed between Avago and Broadcom (AVGO), with the $37 billion combination taking the Broadcom name but keeping the Avago AVGO stock ticker. And in December, NXP completed its own huge deal, acquiring Freescale Semiconductor in a transaction valued near $12 billion.Qualcomm has been among chip companies reportedly looking for acquisitions, with Xilinx (XLNX) among companies it reportedly had eyed.RELATED:Apple Supplier NXP Parlays Freescale M&A To Outpace IndustryBig Chip-Gear Merger Points To Chip Field's Active M&A Environment

61,TEL,"Cisco Systems (CSCO) late Wednesday confirmed that it would ax thousands of jobs and reported Q4 earnings that topped views, though revenue declined 2% amid weakness in China.The computer networking leader said it will slash 5,500 positions, about 7% of its workforce, starting this quarter. Reports had anticipated as many as 14,000 job cuts.Cisco said it will target growth in security; the Internet of Things, or web-connected devices; and cloud computing. More acquisitions could be coming in growth areas, Cisco said.Under CEO Charles Robbins, who took over in July 2015, Cisco has targeted software, services and recurring revenue. On Cisco's earnings conference call with analysts, Robbins said the company will continue investing in its core business -- routing and switching gear -- while targeting growth areas.""We are working diligently on bringing innovation to our core, we're focused on a tighter coupling of security into the core, bringing cloud-based management across the portfolio,"" he said. ""It's not that we're ignoring one area in favor of the other, we want to make sure our investments are commensurate with the growth opportunity.""Robbins said Cisco's job cuts are not related to its budding partnership with Sweden-based Ericsson (ERIC). There's been speculation Cisco could acquire Ericsson, though the gear maker has said that's not in the cards.Cisco said fiscal Q4 earnings per share minus items rose 7% from the year-earlier quarter to 63 cents. Revenue fell 2% to $12.6 billion. Analysts had projected EPS ex items of 60 cents, on revenue of $12.57 billion, for the quarter ended July 30.In the current quarter, Cisco forecast flat revenue of $12.5 billion, in line with views, and non-GAAP EPS of 59 cents, a penny below consensus estimates.Cisco stock was down 1% in after-hours trading, after its earnings release and confirmation of the layoff. Shares fell 1.3%, to 30.72, in Wednesday's regular session on reports it would slash 9,000 to 14,000 workers, raising questions over ""whether forward business trends are weakening,"" one analyst said. Cisco laid off some 11,000 workers between 2011 and 2014.Cisco stock touched 31.25 on Aug. 9, its highest price since November 2007.IBD'S TAKE: Cisco's stock has climbed 13% in 2016, with most gains coming after upping its dividend by 24% in February. Some high-dividend-paying stocks, such as AT&T, have edged down on speculation the Federal Reserve might hike rates this year.

62,TEL,"Tesla Motors (TSLA) cast a cloud over self-driving cars on June 30 when it revealed the first known fatal crash of a vehicle using its Model S Autopilot system.The next day, BMW (BMWYY) teamed up with Intel (INTC) and Mobileye (MBLY) to develop a fully automated driving system, a partnership one analyst called a ""turning point"" for autonomous vehicles.Safety questions or not, the self-driving car era is arriving fast, perhaps even this decade. Automakers and tech companies are plowing billions of dollars into research and forging alliances in a rush for the inside lane on the automobile's most revolutionary track since the Model T.""Everyone is doing something in this space or they'll get left behind,"" said Jeremy Carlson, an automotive technology analyst at research firm IHS. ""This is about the future of the automobile.""BMW said its alliance with Intel and Mobileye aims to ""enable the drivers to not only take their hands off the steering wheel, but reach the so-called 'eyes off' level and ultimately the 'mind off' level, transforming the driver's in-car time into leisure or work time"" -- as soon as 2021.The self-driving vehicle is gaining speed for many reasons. At stake is the future success not just of automakers, but also the suppliers of chips, software, sensors and other technology products that control the new cars.IBD'S TAKE: The auto industry currently ranks 189th in six-month stock performance out of 197 industry groups tracked by Investor's Business Daily.  Even Tesla holds a Relative Strength rating of just 20, indicating it has underperformed 80% of stocks in the past year. But innovation can be the key to future big winning stocks. To learn which stocks are leading the market now, check out IBD's Stock Lists.For automakers, it represents a huge opportunity to sell vehicles that come with driver assistance or self-driving technology. In the ride-sharing industry, Uber, Lyft and their global peers could deploy a fleet of self-driving cars and avoid having to pay drivers. And less human error could mean fewer accidents and less traffic and pollution. At the same time, insurance practices, driving laws and regulations will need rethinking.As is the case with all new technologies, there will be winners and losers. But it will be years before the dust settles to see who's still standing.Tesla's Autopilot has received much of the spotlight lately. The technology, which is installed on new Teslas in a disabled state but can be activated by drivers, is not fully self-driving. It keeps the car within a lane and lets users change lanes with the simple tap of a turn signal. It can manage speed and automatically brake and is designed to help avoid collisions. Drivers are supposed to stay focused on the road and be ready to take over at any time, says Tesla.In the fatal accident, a brightly lit Florida sky prevented the Autopilot system and the driver from detecting the tractor trailer that the car hit, Tesla says. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is investigating.At BMW's July 1 announcement, the carmaker's CEO Harald Krueger expressed sorrow about the incident -- and the obvious: ""Today, the (self-driving) technologies are not ready for serious production.""On Thursday, Consumer Reports magazine urged Tesla to turn off Autopilot and stop referring to it as ""Autopilot,"" and to advise drivers to keep their hands on the wheel while the vehicle is in auto steering mode.Also Thursday, Sen. John Thune, R.-S.D., who heads the U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, asked Tesla to brief the committee about the fatal Florida Autopilot crash by July 29. In a letter to Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Thune said he was interested in company efforts to ensure the Autopilot technology was deployed safely, details of the incident and Tesla's cooperation with the NHTSA.Tesla stock declined 0.5% to $220.40 on Friday.But pretty much everyone in the auto industry is in the chase to be first with ""serious production"" technology.General Motors (GM), Ford (F) , Daimler (DDAIF) and others are fueling up their driverless car programs. GM, Volkswagen (VLKAY)  and Nissan (NSANY) all have cars on the road with Mobileye chips and software that use data from onboard cameras to keep cars within lanes, assist with braking and more.Toyota Motor (TM) plans to spend $1 billion through 2020 to develop self-driving cars.In the technology industry, Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google is known for its pioneering moves in self-driving cars over the past six years. Its test cars, equipped with roof-mounted lasers, radars, cameras and (for now) test drivers, are regularly seen on the roads of Silicon Valley.Alphabet's efforts sped up with its May partnership announcement with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCAU), its first with any car company. The pair agreed to jointly develop a fleet of 100 self-driving minivans.""The deal with Fiat Chrysler is the clearest signal yet that partnerships are where they want to take this,"" as opposed to Google becoming an automaker itself, said IHS analyst Carlson.Apple (AAPL) has not revealed its own plans, but it recently plowed $1 billion into Didi Chuxing, a ride-hailing service competing with Uber in China.Sam Abuelsamid, an analyst at Navigant Research, doubts either Apple or Google would build cars itself. ""They would likely partner with an existing manufacturer,"" he said.Both Apple and Google have lagged the Standard & Poor's 500 index this year. While the S&P is up 6%, Google stock has fallen 5% and Apple shares have dropped 6%.The latest forecast from IHS Automotive calls for sales of nearly 21 million autonomous vehicles in 2035. By then, IHS estimates that nearly 76 million vehicles with some level of autonomy will be sold globally.The consensus estimate seems to be that fully self-driving passenger cars will start motoring down the road in about four years. At first, the cars will likely be restricted to certain areas, and drivers probably will have to remain literally in the driver's seat, expected to take over when hazards arise.As autonomous driving nears, Uber and other ride-hailing services are attracting billions of dollars in investments.Those investments are a bet that ride-hailing services will lead the way in deploying self-driving vehicles. Their business is built on on-demand mobility. Uber last year confirmed it was developing driverless technology.Apple's investment in Didi was part of a $7.3 billion round of funding raised by the Chinese company. Apple so far has only vaguely hinted at its efforts in the automobile field, though its job listings indicate rapid hiring in the field.Volkswagen recently paid $300 million for a stake in Israeli startup Gett, raising its total funding to $520 million. Gett, an Uber rival, currently operates in New York, London, Moscow and Tel Aviv.San Francisco-based Uber, meanwhile, has collected a staggering $12 billion from investors since its 2009 start. It's Silicon Valley's most valuable private company, worth an estimated $62 billion.Its top U.S. rival, Lyft, has attracted more than $5 billion in funding from the likes of GM and Didi.Auto companies are investing in Uber and others partly with hopes to provide them fleets of cars. They also might gain access to reams of driver data that could be used for highly specific mapping information.GM invested $500 million in Lyft with a plan to develop a nationwide on-demand network of self-driving cars. GM also paid $1 billion to acquire Cruise Automation, a San Francisco startup developing software for hands-free driving.Not all automakers will succeed, says Kevin See, an analyst at Lux Research.And technology will not be the decider, according to See, who expects all companies to more or less employ the same technologies.""Few companies will have a significant technology advantage,"" he said. ""So winners will need to capitalize on novel business models, from car sharing and ride sharing to monetizing their own data.""To succeed, automakers most likely will aspire to become ""mobility providers,"" See says, earning money from services like ride sharing rather than solely from selling cars.Toyota recently announced a collaboration with Uber to create mobility services such as ride sharing and car sharing. ""Ride sharing has huge potential in terms of shaping the future of mobility,"" Shigeki Tomoyama, a Toyota senior managing officer, said in the announcement. ""Through this collaboration with Uber, we would like to explore new ways of delivering secure, convenient and attractive mobility services to customers.""Navigant has handicapped the race, saying Germany's Daimler is the No. 1 carmaker in self-driving strategy and execution. The Mercedes-Benz parent company says it's been working on the concept for decades. Its Mercedes F 015 drove itself onto the showroom floor at the January 2015 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, an early headline play in this field.Following Daimler, Navigant ranks in order the other leaders as Volkswagen's Audi, BMW, GM, Volvo, Ford and Toyota. Navigant ranked each company by a list of 12 criteria, such as partnerships and technology, sales and marketing, pricing and company commitment.Tesla, for all the recent attention, came in No. 11.""Tesla's financial stability is not that great, and they do not have a lot of strength in China, where we believe there is a lot of potential for deployment of autonomous vehicles,"" said Abuelsamid. (The company ranked only carmakers, so Google wasn't on the list.)As technology hits high gear, the big roadblocks in the drive toward self-driving cars is the need to develop regulations and insurance policies to cover this new era. NHTSA's investigation of the Tesla fatality could be crucial.Also this month, NHTSA is expected to release documents that will serve as the foundation for national regulations of autonomous vehicles.A handful of states, including California, already have some rules. No state has yet allowed cars without a human operator on the road except to conduct research.""Liability is the biggest problem that faces autonomous driving, as sending an algorithm to prison is not a practical option,"" Richard Windsor, an analyst at Edison Investment Research, told IBD via email. ""When autonomous vehicles crash, and they will, the question arises as to who is responsible for the crash.""Answering that question, says Windsor, is going to take many years.""We are sticking to our 2030 target for self-driving cars becoming a real commercial reality,"" he said.

63,TEL,"Once again, the repulsive face of terror has appeared on our homeland, our own soil. It is not a headline in the news about what has happened in some other place in the world.Once again, we see the blood of our own countrymen shed at the hands of brutal, lawless terrorists and criminals.And once again, we look in the mirror and think about what to do.Just last week, two Palestinian terrorists, dressed as religious Jews, sat down in a popular restaurant in Tel Aviv, ordered dessert, and, 15 minutes later, opened fire and killed four.Israel's ambassador to the United Nations, seeking international condemnation of the act, said sadly and prophetically, ""Today's heinous attack sadly proves that when the international community refuses to condemn terror against Israelis, the next attack is only a matter of time. ... Terror in Tel Aviv must be treated the same as terror in Paris or Istanbul.""Of course, the ambassador had no clue he could have also said Orlando, Fla.There most certainly will be renewed calls to examine and improve our homeland security operations.But as these discussions about security operations at home, and possibly military operations abroad, move forward, I hope that a different discussion also takes place. A discussion that is critical but that most do not want to have.President Reagan defined this in a speech he gave in March 1983 to the National Association of Evangelicals. It was the famous speech in which he called the Soviet Union an ""evil empire.""He went on to say as follows:""While America's military strength is important, let me add here that I've always maintained that the struggle now going on for the world will never be decided by bombs or rockets, by armies or military might. The real crisis we face today is a spiritual one; at root, it is a test of moral will and faith.""A few days following the attacks on Sept.11, 2001, the late Rev. Jerry Falwell Sr. appeared for a discussion with Pat Robertson on Robertson's CBN TV show.Falwell delivered basically the same message that Ronald Reagan conveyed 18 years before. He said the root of the crisis we face is a moral crisis.Falwell said, ""I fear this is only the beginning."" He talked about the implications of ""throwing God out of the public square, out of the schools."" He talked about rampant abortion where, at that time, ""40 million innocent little babies"" had been killed.For these remarks, Falwell and Robertson were widely condemned.But look where we are today. We have defined all the evil in the world as outside of our borders and have done no soul searching of our own.Terror is about wanton disregard for life and property. It's about imposing one's will on others to the point of murder.Since Falwell's remarks on CBN, almost another 20 million unborn children have been killed. And the federal government uses taxpayers' money to direct funds to Planned Parenthood, the nation's largest abortion provider.Sadly, today we are not a nation that respects life. And the increasing power of the federal government, extending its growing reach into the lives of private citizens, shows our nation has decreasing respect for private property.Reagan was right. We will not be victorious over terrorism with might alone. Behind that might must be a virtuous and moral nation that all nations respect. We must be a nation that knows how and when to use power, and against whom, because we know the difference between right and wrong.Of course we need to fight terrorism. But we have not made more progress in this war because we have failed to address the spiritual and moral crisis within. Without doing this, this will be, as Rev. Falwell said in 2001, ""only the beginning.""

64,TEL,"Part of Bernie Sanders' charm is that for all of his arm-waving jeremiads, he appears unthreatening. He's the weird old uncle in the attic, Larry David's crazy Bernie. It's almost a matter of style. Who can be afraid of a candidate so irascible, grumpy, old-fashioned and unfashionable?After all, he's not going to win the nomination, so what harm can he do? A major address at the party convention? A say in the vice presidential selection? And who reads party platforms anyway?Well, platforms may not immediately affect a particular campaign. But they do express, quite literally, the party line, a written record of its ideological trajectory.Which is why two of Sanders' appointments to the 15-member platform committee are so stunning. Professor Cornel West not only has called the Israeli prime minister a war criminal, but openly supports the BDS movement (boycott, divestment and sanctions), the most important attempt in the world to ostracize and delegitimize Israel.West is joined on the committee by the longtime pro-Palestinian activist James Zogby. Together, reported The New York Times, they ""vowed to upend what they see as the party's lopsided support of Israel.""This seems a gratuitous provocation. Sanders hardly made Israel central to his campaign. He did call Israel's response in the 2014 Gaza war ""disproportionate"" and said ""we cannot continue to be one-sided."" But now Sanders seeks to permanently alter -- i.e. weaken -- the relationship between the Democratic Party and Israel, which has been close and supportive since Harry Truman recognized the world's only Jewish state when it declared independence in May 1948.West doesn't even pretend, as do some left-wing ""peace"" groups, to be opposing Israeli policy in order to save it from itself. He makes the simpler case that occupation is unconscionable oppression and that until Israel abandons it, Israel deserves to be treated like apartheid South Africa -- anathematized, cut off, made to bleed morally and economically. The Sanders appointees wish to bend the Democratic platform to encourage such diminishment unless Israel redeems itself by liberating Palestine.This is an unusual argument for a Democratic platform committee, largely because it is logically and morally perverse. Israel did in fact follow such high-minded advice in 2005: It terminated its occupation and evacuated Gaza. That earned it (temporary) praise from the West. And from the Palestinians? Not peace, not reconciliation, not normal relations but a decade of unrelenting terrorism and war.Israel is now being asked -- pressured -- to repeat that same disaster on the West Bank. That would bring the terror war, quite fatally, to the very heart of Israel -- Tel Aviv, Jerusalem, Ben Gurion Airport. Israel is now excoriated for declining that invitation to national suicide.It is ironic that the most successful Jewish presidential candidate ever should be pushing the anti-Israel case. But perhaps not surprising considering Sanders' ideological roots. He is old left -- not the post-1960s, countercultural New Left. Why, the man honeymooned in the Soviet Union -- not such fashionably cool communist paradises as Sandinista Nicaragua where Bill de Blasio went to work for the cause or Castro's Cuba where de Blasio honeymooned. (Do lefties all use the same wedding planner?)For the old left, Israel was simply an outpost of Western imperialism, Middle East division. To this day, the leftist consensus, most powerful in Europe (which remains Sanders' ideological lodestar), holds that Israeli perfidy demands purification by Western chastisement.Chastisement there will be at the Democratic platform committee. To be sure, Sanders didn't create the Democrats' drift away from Israel. It was already visible at the 2012 convention with the loud resistance to recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital. But Sanders is consciously abetting it.The millennials who worship him and pack his rallies haven't lived through -- and don't know -- the history of Israel's half-century of peace offers. They don't know of the multiple times Israel has offered to divide the land with an independent Palestinian state and been rebuffed.Sanders hasn't lifted a finger to tell them. The lovable old guy with the big crowds and no chance at the nomination is hardly taken seriously (except by Hillary Clinton, whose inability to put him away reveals daily her profound political weakness). But when he makes platform appointees that show he does take certain things quite seriously, like undermining the U.S.-Israeli relationship, you might want to reconsider your equanimity about the magical mystery tour. It looks like Woodstock, but there is steel inside the psychedelic glove.

66,TEL,"The company chairman recently declared the importance of partnerships, but Cisco Systems (CSCO) continued its acquisitive ways Friday, announcing an agreement to buy London-based videoconferencing firm Acano for $700 million in cash and stock.""This acquisition will accelerate Cisco's collaboration strategy to deliver video everywhere, providing the best collaboration experience across every endpoint, every screen, every workspace and to every user,"" Cisco said in a press release.Cisco stock was up 1% in morning trading in the stock market today , near 27.63. Cisco stock touched an eight-year high of 30.31 in March.Cisco said Acano's hardware and software products let customers connect video systems from multiple vendors across both cloud and hybrid environments. Acano says it has more than 170 employees.The No. 1 maker of networking gear is migrating more of its business to the cloud. It gets about 7% of its revenue from its videoconferencing business, or about $3.4 billion a year.Cisco's partnership efforts also have ratcheted up of late. This month, it announced a strategic partnership with the Swedish telecom-gear leader Ericsson (ERIC), and in August Cisco and Apple (AAPL) announced they had teamed up to create a ""fast lane"" to make it easier for businesses and other enterprises to use Apple's smartphones, tablets and other mobile devices.In October, Cisco announced it would acquire both security analytics software firm Lancope for $452.5 million in cash and stock, and ParStream, a German-based provider of distributed analytics for Internet of Things data, for an undisclosed sum.In September, Cisco unveiled plans to buy cybersecurity specialist Portcullis Computer Security. In July, Cisco said it's buying MaintenanceNet, a data analytics company. In June, Cisco said it would buy OpenDNS, another security-related firm.But speaking to a Nov. 11 Morgan Stanley TMT conference, Cisco Executive Chairman John Chambers said: ""Partnership will be as important over the next two decades as acquisitions were over the past two decades for us. If we do it right, our peers won't be able to keep up.""Revenue for Cisco's collaboration business, including videoconferencing, rose 17% year on year in its fiscal Q1 ended Oct. 24. Acano will become part of the Cisco Collaboration Technology Group led by Rowan Trollope, senior vice president and general manager. Cisco says less than 10% of the world's conference rooms are connected with video.""As the momentum continues, there is a need to deliver solutions that will connect any system, regardless of vendor, at a scale that is dramatically higher than ever before,"" Cisco said in its press release. ""Acano's technology and expertise will enable us to accelerate our development in the key areas of interoperability and scalability.""

67,TEL,"Cisco Systems (CSCO) stock gapped down Friday to a six-week low after the company gave lower-than-expected guidance late Thursday, with investors not appeased as yet with CEO Chuck Robbins' message that better days are ahead.The company's earnings and sales for its fiscal Q1, ended Oct. 24, beat Wall Street expectations, but its Q2 guidance missed.""We're doing all the right things to drive our growth,"" CEO Chuck Robbins said on the company's earnings conference call. And he said those things would be more obvious in the ""coming months.""Just maybe not this month or next.

Analysts had modeled EPS up 6%, at 56 cents, and sales up 5%, to $12.55 billion.On the other hand, more than $1 billion in annual sales should accrue starting in 2018 from Cisco's ""strategic partnership"" with Ericsson (ERIC), Robbins had assured when he and Ericsson CEO Hans Vestberg announced the partnership Monday.FBR analyst Daniel Ives pointed out in a research note Friday that Cisco's Q1 security segment revenue had risen 7% despite touch comparisons with the year-earlier figure. He called that a ""bright spot.""""The company's impressive turnaround on this segment after years of pain and on the shoulders of its SourceFire acquisition (in 2013) now appears to be hitting its stride, which we loudly applaud,"" Ives said.""We continue to point to massive strength in firewall spending and next-generation cybersecurity initiatives (unified threat management, endpoint, email, database security) heading into 2016, while 'emergency security spending' has ticked down, which clearly impacts FireEye (FEYE) more than any other vendor. Cisco security share gains have subsided as the company has finally figured out the right formula/better execution and now the focus is on identifying the winners in the land grab opportunity for this $30 billion cyberpie over the next three years.""Ives said FireEye and possibly Fortinet (FTNT) could be Cisco acquisition targets in 2016 ""for Robbins as he looks to significantly expand Cisco's security footprint in this fertile market for years to come.""Similarly, Andrew Chanin, CEO of PureFunds, which offers the PureFunds ISE Cyber Security ETF (HACK) with Cisco as a top-10 holding, sees promise in Cisco's security products.""Investments in areas like cybersecurity for the firm have the potential to provide some more growth as opposed to its other, more mature business lines,"" Chanin told IBD Friday. ""It's a combination of them not just relying on their mature revenue-generating business units but expanding into those with more growth potential.""FBN Securities analyst Shebly Seyrafi maintained his outperform rating on Cisco stock but lowered his price target to 32 from 35, ""driven largely by uncertainty from macro (primarily outside the U.S.) and currency.""""Although data center revenue of $850 million basically met consensus, its growth (23% year over year) continues to be strong as Cisco continues to take share in the server market,"" Syrafi wrote in a research note.Cisco stock was down 6% in afternoon trading in the stock market today, near 26.Among Cisco's healthiest networking rivals, Juniper Networks (JNPR) stock was down 3% Friday afternoon. Ericsson stock was down 2%, near 9, and is off 9% since its Monday gain following the partnership disclosure with Cisco.

68,TEL,"Democratic presidential candidates Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton often assert that the only way to correct wealth inequality in America is to tax the rich at even higher rates. A new study suggests this is false.As part of what she called the “growth and fairness economy,” Hillary Clinton has proposed surtaxes on the wealthy and higher taxes on all capital gains to ""shuffle the deck,"" as she put it.In the past, she has hammered the rich for being, well, rich. “Economists have documented how the share of income and wealth going to those at the very top, not just the top 1% but the top 0.1% the 0.01% of the population, has risen sharply over the last generation,” she said two years ago, while prepping to run for president. “Some are calling it a throwback to the Gilded Age of the robber barons.”In fact, both Clinton and Sanders would raise rates on the wealthy to as high as 50% -- and in some cases, higher. With U.S. debt exploding and deficits expected for years to come, the political pressure will be great to extract even more money from the so-called rich to pay the nation's bills.But even if they succeed, the primary stated goal of taxing the rich -- closing the inequality gap -- wouldn't be achieved.Surprisingly, the study that shows this comes not from some ideologically oriented think tank in the U.S., but from a team of researchers at Tel-Aviv University.Using historic data in the U.S. from 1930 to 2010, they created a model based on income and capital asset values that very closely tracked wealth inequality in America. The correlation was 96% -- a very tight fit between the model and reality.So, they asked, what would happen in the U.S. if by 2030 you taxed away much of the income of those at the top of the earning ladder? Would the gap in wealth between the rich and the rest of us shrink?The surprising answer that came back was no. As Ross Pomeroy noted at the Real Clear Science web site, even raising taxes to a level that created very low income inequality would still lead to the top 10% of all incomes controlling 78.6% of all the wealth by 2030. OK, but what if you cut taxes on the rich instead, leading them to have even more income in 2030 than they already do? The top 10% would control roughly 79.3% of all the wealth.In other words, there's barely any meaningful difference at all. How can this be? The reason is savings. Those at the bottom of the income ladder tend to save little, while those with much income tend to save a lot. And savings, which are ultimately turned into investments, are the source of wealth. So policies that promote savings and wealth accumulation for the middle-class and working poor would be far more effective at closing the wealth gap. And eventually, the income gap, too.Yes, higher taxes would mean the rich would save less. But they would still own their wealth.Do we really want to have the rich save less, when those savings are the engine of future investment, jobs and growth in the economy?Do we want more of our smartest, most talented, most entrepreneurial people leaving our country to preserve their hard-won wealth from the prying hands of Big Government?Obviously, the answer should be no.Nor is this the only research to come to this conclusion.A study from the liberal-centrist Brookings Institution last year asked what would happen if the top tax rate was lifted to 50% from 40%, with the money going to the bottom fifth of all households. That would equal roughly $100 billion a year in income redistribution.The study's authors found the impact on income inequality, as measured by the widely used Gini index, would still be ""exceedingly modest.""The fact is, in 2013, the most recent year for which data are available, the top 1% in incomes earned 19% of all U.S. income, but paid 38% of all income taxes. So Sanders and Clinton are right when they say the tax code is unfair -- it's unfair to those at higher incomes.The only reason for imposing higher taxes on the wealthy, who already pay more than their fair share, is class warfare, spite and envy -- the worst things on Earth on which to base economic policy. If Clinton and Sanders were truly serious about closing the inequality gap, they would be pushing for lower taxes, fewer regulations, school choice, more incentives to save and other things that would boost economic growth -- not class warfare.

69,TEL,"In a bid to unlock the Apple (AAPL) iPhone belonging to one of the San Bernardino, Calif., shooters, the FBI has turned to Israeli digital forensics firm Cellebrite, according to a number of media reports Wednesday.Reuters said that the Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper in Tel Aviv was the first to report that Cellebrite was working with U.S. law enforcement to unlock the device. Cellebrite provides mobile forensic software.Executives at Cellebrite and Apple have declined to comment on the reports. So have FBI officials.Apple is engaged in a legal battle with the U.S. Justice Department over a judge's order that it write new software to disable pass-code protection on the iPhone that the shooter used. The ensuing legal fight has become a lightning rod for a broader debate on data privacy vs. security.Led by CEO Tim Cook, Apple had refused to create code to unlock the phone, saying that doing so would create a “back door” to bypass its security protections and thus threaten the personal data of millions of iPhone users. Apple says that the government is overstepping its bounds by ordering Apple to unlock the phone.But the case between Apple and the FBI could come to an abrupt end if Cellebrite can unlock it.Apple and the FBI were set to face off in court on Tuesday, but on Monday a federal judge agreed to the government's request to postpone the hearing after U.S. prosecutors said that a ""third party"" had presented a possible method for opening an encrypted iPhone without Apple’s help.Cellebrite signed a sole-service contract with the FBI in 2013 to provide data-extraction service, according to Buzzfeed.Cellebrite says on its website that it can obtain data from Apple phones that use the iPhone's most recent operating system. A case study on the Cellebrite site shows that the company has worked with U.S. law enforcement to unlock phones, including an LG phone for the Tacoma, Wash., police department.A subsidiary of Japan's Sun Corp., Cellebrite has its revenue split between two business segments: technology for mobile retailers and a forensics system that law enforcement, military and intelligence use to retrieve data hidden inside mobile devices, Reuters said.

71,TEL,"2016: Democratic front-runner Bernie Sanders says concerns about his honeymoon trip to the USSR in the ’80s are “silly."" He’ll have a harder time explaining his months-long stay at a hardcore Stalinist camp in the ’60s.It’s clear the self-avowed socialist is even further left than he has admitted. Fifty years ago, during the height of the Cold War, he sought out communist indoctrination.The Israeli press earlier this month broke the story that Sanders, who is Jewish, spent several months at an Israeli commune co-founded by a Soviet spy. The revelation is just now wending its way through the American media, where it’s been confirmed by none other than the New York Times, though the pro-Democrat paper predictably buried the story on its back pages.As a college student in 1963, Sanders was a guest of the Hashomer Hatzair, a Marxist youth movement founded by communist Ya’akov Hazan, who called the Soviet Union a second homeland and eulogized Stalin as “the great leader and extolled commander. We lower our flag in grief in memory of the great revolutionary fighter (and) architect of socialist construction.”Ignoring Stalin’s atrocities, Hazan oozed: “His huge historical achievements will guide generations in their march toward the reign of socialism and communism the world over.”The Marxist movement Sanders joined pledged its allegiance to the Soviet Union and was described as “Stalinist” as late as 1969 — well after Sanders’ visit.Sanders has acknowledged staying at a “kibbutz;” but there are many of them in Israel, and he and his campaign have refused to ID which one he attended. The Tel Aviv paper Haaretz dug up the records, revealing the exact camp -- Sha’ar Ha’amakim -- and noted that it was founded in 1935 during Stalin’s reign.The Times reported that Sanders' camp viewed the USSR as a model society worthy of adoption, and often flew the Red flag at its events -- the same flag, notably, that Sanders would later hang in his office as mayor of Burlington, Vt., according to the New York Post.The Times says Sanders and his comrades would farm in the morning and then partake in “cultural events” in the afternoon. Did he sing the communist workers’ anthem? Pay homage to Lenin and Stalin?Voters ought to know. Only, the media aren't interested in finding out. So far no debate moderator has asked Sanders about his commie camp days. Strikingly, even Fox News let Sanders off the hook in a rare interview last Sunday.Sanders has a long resume of radicalism. Here’s the rest of Sanders’ subversive past the media are keeping under wraps:1963-64: He joined the Young People’s Socialist League, the youth wing of the Socialist Party USA. Sanders also organized for a communist front, the United Packinghouse Workers Union, which at the time was infiltrated by hardened Communist agents and under investigation by the House Committee on Un-American Activities.1971-76: Sanders helped found the socialist Liberty Union Party in Vermont, where he ran for governor and senator while calling for the government takeover of the medical industry and ""all privately owned electric utilities,"" as well as the “nationalization of the oil industry” -- “without compensation to the banks and wealthy individuals who own them.”Sounding like Lenin, he also demanded the government actually seize corporate assets and the wealth of billionaires, namely the Rockefellers, and redistribute it “for all people.""1977: As founder of the socialist American People’s Historical Society, Sanders produced a 30-minute color documentary exalting his hero, socialist revolutionary Eugene Debs, who was jailed under the Espionage Act. (Today he keeps a portrait of Debs on his Senate office wall.)1979: Sanders penned a piece for a local leftist rag arguing for the public takeover of the television industry, banishing commercial advertising and putting content under control of the government, a la Pravda.1981: As Burlington’s new mayor, Sanders announced he didn’t believe in private charities and favored disbanding them, explaining government should be responsible for all social welfare and charity.1981: Sanders adopted a Soviet sister city outside Moscow, as well as a city in Nicaragua to support the communist Sandinista revolution there.1985: Sanders invited officials from the Soviet Union and communist China to stop by his office, while proposing that Washington divert military defense funds to “pay for thousands of U.S. children to go to the Soviet Union.""July 1985: After passing a resolution pledging Burlington would defy President Reagan’s embargo on communist-controlled Nicaragua, Sanders traveled to Managua to attend, along with Soviet officials, an anti-U.S. rally sponsored by the Sandinistas.He reportedly stood with a crowd that chanted, “Here, there, everywhere, the Yankee will die.” His trip was said to have been paid for by the Sandinista government. Sanders, in turn, invited Sandinista leader Daniel Ortega to visit the U.S.1985: In a letter to the Sandinistas, according to the New York Post, Sanders pledged his support for their “struggle,” calling it a “heroic revolution” while accusing the Reagan administration of engaging in “terrorist activities.”1985: In an interview with Vermont government-access TV, Sanders claimed: “The Sandinista government has more support among the Nicaraguan people -- substantially more support -- than Ronald Reagan has among the American people,” even though Reagan had just been reelected in a historic landslide.1985: In the same interview, he praised Cuban dictator Fidel Castro, claiming “he educated their kids, gave their kids health care, totally transformed society.” He later showed his affection by traveling to Havana and meeting with its mayor.1985: In an interview with the Los Angeles Times, Sanders proclaimed: “The whole quality of life in America is based on greed. I believe in the redistribution of wealth in this nation.”1988:  One day after wedding his second and current wife, Jane Sanders, the two traveled to the USSR for their honeymoon. Upon returning, Sanders praised communist health care and housing, noting “the cost of both services is much, much higher in the United States.”1989: With the West on the verge of winning the Cold War, Sanders addressed the national conference of the U.S. Peace Council -- another known front for the Communist Party USA, whose members swore an oath to “the triumph of Soviet power in the U.S.”This is what Sanders really means by “political revolution,” a battle cry he mouthed no fewer than four times during a recent national debate.Sanders isn’t just a “socialist.” Or even a communist sympathizer. He is a hard-core communist collaborator who is far, far outside the American political mainstream. So far outside, in fact, there undoubtedly is a file with his name on it at the FBI documenting his subversive activities.Let’s hope it is leaked to the public before Sanders gets any closer to the White House.

Chris Christie, who contended that cleaning up the Obama foreign policy ""mess"" must begin with America's allies being ""able to count on our word.""The premature exits of U.S. troops from Iraq and Afghanistan — with the Islamic State and the Taliban, respectively, filling the vacuums — were symbolic of the U.S. seeming to come to the rescue, then being unable or unwilling to fulfill its commitment.

He called it ""absolutely disgraceful"" that Secretary of State John Kerry and other administration figures made the seizure of captivity of 10 U.S. sailors this week by Iran appear to be ""a good thing"" and a sign of an improved relationship between Washington and Tehran.Christie said, ""the military is not ready, either. We need to rebuild our military, and this president has let it diminish to a point where tinpot dictators like the mullahs in Iran are taking our Navy ships.""He argued: ""If you're worried about the world being on fire; you're worried about how we're going to use our military; you're worried about strengthening our military, and you're worried most of all about keeping your homes and your families safe and secure, you cannot give Hillary Clinton a third term of Barack Obama's leadership.""Christie later brought up a seldom-made point: ""after Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama have had nearly eight years, we have fewer democracies in the world than we had when they started,"" which ""makes the world less peaceful, less safe.""Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush echoed Christie on military neglect. ""In this administration, every weapon system has been gutted,"" he charged. ""In this administration, the force levels are going down to a level where we can't even project force. Our friends no longer think we have their back and our enemies no longer fear us . . . and for the life of me I have no understanding why the president thinks that everything is going well.""Bush promised to ""restore the strength of the military,"" noting that Obama Defense Secretary Ash Carter just ""announced that the Navy's going to be cut again. It's now half the size of what it was prior to Operation Desert Storm.""He called troop deployments ""too high for the military personnel. We don't have procurement being done for refreshing the equipment. The B-52 is still operational as the long-range bomber; it was inaugurated in the age of Harry Truman. The planes are older than the pilots. We're gutting our military, and so the Iranians and the Chinese and the Russians and many other countries look at the United States not as serious as we once were.""On Iran, Bush promised to ""reimpose sanctions,"" said he would move the U.S. embassy in Israel ""from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem to send a serious signal that we're back in the game with Israel, and sign an agreement that makes sure that the world knows that they will have technological superiority.""Citing American decline under Obama, Bush warned that ""the rest of the world is moving away from us toward other alliances because we are weak.Bush thought ""Hillary Clinton would be a national security disaster."" But Florida Sen. Marco Rubio went further, charging that she is ""disqualified from being commander in chief of the United States"" because she proved she ""cannot handle intelligence information appropriately"" and is ""someone who lies to the families of those four victims in Benghazi"" — U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens and the three other U.S. personnel killed by Islamist terrorists on Sept. 11, 2012.Rubio also may get the award for the most succinct and candid description of the Obama Doctrine of foreign policy: ""Barack Obama believes that America is an arrogant global power that needs to be cut down to size.""Moreover, he promised that if elected, he would give terrorists ""a one-way ticket to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and we are going to find out everything they know,"" which may make him the first candidate to associate himself with the CIA's enhanced interrogation under George W. Bush, if only subtly.National security and immigration are now connected in a way they have never been in any previous presidential election year. The candidate who made the clearest connection was Sen. Ted Cruz, who called for passage of his Expatriate Terrorist Act, which ""says if an American goes and joins ISIS and wages jihad against America, that you forfeit your citizenship and you cannot come in on a passport.""Another Cruz bill ""suspends all refugees from nations"" where ""ISIS or al-Qaida controls significant territory."" The Texas senator noted that ""we had Iran putting operatives in South America and Central America. It's the reason why I stood with Jeff Sessions and Steve King and led the fight to stop the Gang of Eight amnesty bill, because it was clear then, like it's clear now, that border security is national security.""Cruz called Obama ""a president who refuses to acknowledge the threat we face and even worse, who acts as an apologist for radical Islamic terrorism,"" and he said of the Islamic State, referring to Obama's ""degrade and destroy"" approach, ""we will not weaken them; we will not degrade them; we will utterly and completely destroy ISIS.""Beyond illegals sneaking across our porous border, Marco Rubio warned of the hazards of legal immigration when it comes to terrorists. ISIS, he said, has ""a sophisticated understanding of our legal immigration system"" and it ""must now be reexamined for security first and foremost, with an eye on ISIS.""Rubio warned that ISIS is ""recruiting people to enter this country as engineers, posing as doctors, posing as refugees. We know this for a fact. They've contacted the trafficking networks in the Western Hemisphere to get people in through the southern border. And they got a killer in San Bernardino posing as a fiancee.""Donald Trump used his closing statement to connect the humiliation of the 10 sailors by Iran with the Iran nuclear deal, contending that ""the only reason we got them back is because we owed them, with a stupid deal, $150 billion."" That was a reference to the massive amount in Iranian assets being unfrozen under the pact, much of which the world's foremost terror state can be expected to use to further finance terrorist activities by Hamas, Hezbollah and other jihadist groups.A revitalized superpower America that destroys the Islamic State and prevents terrorists from exploiting a broken immigration system constituted the shared vision of the Republicans on the North Charleston, S.C., stage Thursday night.Details on carrying out those challenging tasks were scant, however.

124,TEL,"In an unusual legal move, the Obama administration has taken the legal side of the Palestinian Authority and Palestine Liberation Organization in a federal court case that American terrorism victims' families had already won.Lawyers for the Justice and State Departments are arguing that the PA and PLO should not have to post a bond showing they can pay the massive damages during their appeal in U.S. federal court.One of the families' attorneys argued otherwise. ""The State Department should stand on the side of the American terror
"
125,TEL,"victims and not on the side of the Palestinian suicide bombers,"" said Nitsana Darshan-Leitner of the Israel Law Center.The jury's judgment against the Palestinian groups came in a case, Sokolow v. PLO, before Manhattan U.S. District Judge George Daniels in February and could involve penalties of more than $650 million, triple the amount of damages awarded by the jury under U.S. law, plus interest.The money would go to victims in seven deadly terrorist attacks in Israel between 2001 and 2004, including 11 American families. Hundreds were injured and 33 killed in the attacks.For defendants to appeal the immense judgment, the judge can require them to post a bond of a substantial portion of the damages in case they lose again. Judge Daniels had said he was likely to order that as “some meaningful demonstration that the defendant is ready and willing to pay the judgment.”However, last week in a strange move lawyers for the

128,TEL,"appeal. That leaves the financial awards to American families uncovered. So, whose side is this White House on?The administration's affidavit, including a statement by Deputy Secretary of State Anthony Blinken, claimed the Palestinians' ability to govern would be ""severely compromised"" by such a substantial bond. Although apparently no one on the Palestinian side considered the consequences on the attacks' victims or its own financial culpability for sponsoring such acts.The U.S. statement added: ""The continued viability of the PA is essential to key U.S. security and diplomatic interests, including advancing peace between Israel and the Palestinians, supporting the security of U.S. allies such as Israel, Jordan and Egypt, combating extremism and terrorism, and promoting good governance.""Officials tried to claim they were not taking sides by helping the Palestinians avoid financial responsibility for the attacks in Israel. ""This filing is a statement of the interests of the United States and not on behalf of any party,” a State Department spokesman said, although the financial impact would be to the benefit of the guilty defendants.That claim of not taking sides was hotly disputed by the families' attorneys.One of them, Darshan Leitner, heads Shurat HaDin-Israel Law Center, a nonprofit based in Tel Aviv. It has become known internationally as a kind of legal pitbull going after the finances and financiers of terrorism globally.""Bankrupting terror one lawsuit at a time,"" is its motto. A major goal of the Israel Law Center is economically destroying Middle Eastern terror groups by tracking their assets and bank accounts and legally obstructing and restraining their funds. To date, the center has won terrorism judgments in excess of $2 billion and collected more than $200 million for victims.By taking sides to help the PLO avoid bond, Darshan-Leitner added:""The State Department ignores the fact that Palestinians continue to pay monthly payments to imprisoned terrorists and to the families of the suicide bombers, who devastated the lives of the victims in this case. If the Palestinians have the funds to continue making these payments, they certainly have the funds to post a bond.""Now, it's up to the judge.

129,TEL,"War On Terror: Besides Israel, no nation has helped the U.S. fight Islamist terror more than the world's largest people without a country, the Kurds. America should stop taking them for granted.Despite its NATO membership, and its misleading image as supposedly the most Western of Muslim nations, Turkey is quite anti-American, more so than many Mideast Islamic states.Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has been little help against the Islamic State. As mayor of Istanbul in 1997, celebrating the city's Ottoman conquest, he is on record as saying: ""The image of the Jews is no different from that of the Nazis.""Turkey openly supports the al-Qaida-allied Syrian groups Jabhat al Nusra and Ahrar ash Sham. And Erdogan was just in Beijing, forging links with our global adversary China, which over many years helped Iran build its nuclear program.Today, Erdogan's armed forces play a game of simultaneously combating Islamic State and Kurdish separatists. The unexpected deal allowing the U.S. to use the strategically well-located Incirlik Air Base — from where it can utilize 30 fighter jets and 300 troops against Islamic State locations in northern Syria — must be viewed in that context of Turkey's dubious long-term objectives.After Turkish intelligence was apparently helping Islamic State forces move to and fro across Turkey's Syrian border, now all of a sudden the Turks are getting serious about airstrikes against the Islamic State — as they hit Kurdish forces hard too.Too great a Kurdish victory over the Islamic State in the coming weeks would spell a de-facto Kurdish state on Turkey's southern border, which Erdogan has made clear he won't tolerate.So President Obama is actually coordinating with Turkey, when it is the Kurds who have been our most effective allies against the Islamic State — the unspeakably savage Islamic State, of course, being an entity brought into being by Obama's policies of abandoning Iraq.Modestly armed, this valiant people, fighting alongside regional Arab and Christian forces, defeated the Islamic State barbarians again and again, in Kobani, Tel Abyad, and Hassakeh, to name just a few victory sites. And unlike ethnic-cleansing Shiite militants, they didn't leave a trail of beheaded innocents in their wake.Since Iraq's and Syria's borders are in flux thanks to the Islamic State, we should think seriously about backing the Kurds — who have so loyally backed us — in their long-delayed and much-deserved national aspirations.

143,TEL,"Iran Deal: The president claims that if Tehran cheats, ""sanctions that have helped to cripple the Iranian economy will snap back into place."" But he won't want them to, because then the deal would be dead.Should Iran violate any aspect of this deal,"" the White House tells us, ""the UN, U.S. and EU can snap the sanctions that have crippled Iran's economy back into place.""But ""can"" doesn't mean ""will.""""Snap back"" is a cool term. It's what adjustable baseball caps worn backwards have long been called in hip-hop black urban culture.The way the snapback mechanism works, if the U.S. or one of the other P5+1 believes that Iran is cheating, it can convene a United Nations Security Council vote on sanctions in which the U.S. or another permanent Security Council member could veto continued sanctions relief, thus reinstating sanctions on Iran in 30 days.An unnamed U.S. official boasted that the U.S., not Russia or China, now has the veto: ""We flipped the presumption so the veto works to our advantage.""But the process also requires going through an international ""joint commission,"" then an international ""advisory board,"" which would likely take more than two months. Moreover, within the agreement is a key passage: ""Iran has stated that if sanctions are reinstated in whole or in part, Iran will treat that as grounds to cease performing its commitments"" under the pact.In other words, if Iran cheats and we do anything about it, the deal is dead. Is Barack Obama going to do that? Not on your legacy (or, rather, his). And the next president, even a Republican, might have reasons not to do it either.As Pascal-Emmanuel Gobry, an Ethics and Public Policy Center fellow, writes in TheWeek.com: ""In the real world, once sanctions are scrapped, political pressure to keep the sanctions gone, particularly from elites in places that do business with Iran — like Russia, China, Germany and France — will be enormous.""What's more, a paper last month from the Foundation For Defense of Democracies warned, ""In the later years of the agreement, international companies may have invested tens of billions of dollars back into Iran and will likely be less willing to forgo their business interests because of Iranian nuclear violations.""So the soon-to-come sanctions relief under the pact will actually blunt the pain of re-imposed sanctions.Obama conceded Wednesday that Iran is a terrorist menace ""that has proclaimed that Israel shouldn't exist, that has denied the Holocaust, that has financed Hezbollah, and as a consequence there are missiles that are pointed towards Tel Aviv."" But his deal should be accepted because ""all those threats are compounded if Iran gets a nuclear weapon.""Unfortunately, even in the unlikely event that sanctions do ""snap back,"" his deal's initial sanctions relief compounds those threats — without Iran getting a nuke. And then, in the end, through cheating on the deal, an economically stronger Tehran, less fearful of re-imposed sanctions, will likely end up with nuclear weapons anyway.

163,TEL,"ChipmakerSkyworks Solutions (SWKS) is poised to significantly expand its global presence as well as its profit margins over the next two years, according to an analyst report released late Monday.As Chinese telecom carriers transition from 2G phones to 3G smartphones and 4G LTE wireless broadband services for customers, Skyworks is likely to have a strong presence in what will be a big market.""We anticipate a growing global mix of LTE smartphones and Skyworks' share gains with leading Chinese OEMs should drive 15% plus sales growth into the smartphone market over the next two years,"" said Canaccord Genuity analyst Michael Walkley in a research report. ""The potential dollar content available for Skyworks increases from roughly 30 cents to 50 cents in a 2G phone to $2 to $3 in a lower-end 3G smartphone to $4 to $6 for a midtier LTE smartphone and to $10-plus for high-end global LTE smartphones,"" he said.Walkley increased his target price on Skyworks stock to 62 from 55, and reiterated a buy rating.Skyworks stock was flat, near 52, in midday trading in the stock market today, but shares are up more than 80% this year for a company that has been in the IBD 50 list of top-performing stocks for weeks, as well as an IBD Leaderboard stock.""Given Skyworks' broad RFIC (radio frequency integrated circuit) portfolio and customer base, we believe Skyworks' diverse analog portfolio is enabling content share gains in its smartphone customer base,"" Walkley said. ""Further, we anticipate strong ongoing sales to Wi-Fi 802.11ac, wireless infrastructure, and the IoT (Internet of Things) markets should contribute to strong sales and improving margins.""The report was released after meetings with Don Palette, Skyworks' chief financial officer, at a Canaccord investor conference last week.The Woburn, Mass.-based company has a diverse portfolio of analog chips used in cars, broadband gear, cellular infrastructure, energy management, GPS devices, smartphones and tablets.Skyworks chips are used in the Apple (AAPL) iPhone and Samsung Galaxy F4 and F5, but recently its chip growth is being driven in part by fitness wearables, such as Philips ' (PHG) wearable technologies and wellness applications, and by home automation, JMP Securities analyst Alex Gauna told IBD.""They're in a lot of new automobile applications,"" Gauna said. ""The automobile is so sensor-intensive now, with a lot of RF (radio frequency) and analog content that Skyworks can provide.""New product launches and an aggressive push into new markets have helped drive recent revenue growth. For its fiscal Q3 ended June 30, Skyworks posted year-over-year revenue growth of 35%, its biggest growth in more than three years.""While we understand investor concerns regarding slowing smartphone/handset unit sales growth, we believe investors do not fully appreciate Skyworks' diverse content opportunities, increasing mix of higher-margin integrated mobile solutions vs. stand-alone power amplifiers, and improving competitive position,"" Walkley said.Skyworks products, for instance, will help enable navigation-assist capabilities in some of next year's Volkswagen (VLKAY) models and will go into Ericsson's (ERIC) 4G LTE mobile broadband base stations. Skyworks chips are going into enhanced video-streaming applications for TV set-top boxes, Blu-ray/ DVD players and LED/4K television.Skyworks also sees promising opportunities in medical devices, gaming platforms and industrial markets.RELATED:Worldwide smartphone market grows in Q2.

230,TEL,"Apple stock was down more than 1% to below 129 in afternoon trading on the stock market today.Just days after getting socked with a half-billion-dollar patent infringement penalty by a federal jury, Apple (AAPL) is facing fresh patent lawsuits.On Tuesday, a jury in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas ruled that Apple's iTunes software infringed three patents held by patent licensing firm Smartflash. The federal jury ordered Apple to pay $532.9 million in damages.On Wednesday, Smartflash decided to take another bite of the apple, suing the Cupertino, Calif.-based company for using the same patents without permission in devices introduced since the original case was filed in May 2013, Reuters reported. Those devices include the iPhone 6 series smartphones and iPad Air 2 tablet.Proponents of patent reform called Smartflash a patent troll for using patents to shake down other companies for money instead of producing products.""This case is Exhibit A for patent reform,"" Gary Shapiro, CEO of the Consumer Electronics Association, said in a statement. ""The patent troll in this case doesn't produce any products and services, has zero employees and operates from an office across the street from the courthouse in the notoriously troll-friendly Eastern District of Texas.""This sort of blatant patent extortion is exactly the reason why Congress needs to act now on patent reform. This is yet another of example of the tsunami of bogus patent claims that drain $1.5 billion a week from the U.S. economy. The only atypical aspect of this case is the defendant — the majority of patent troll victims are small firms without big legal budgets, who can easily be coerced into a settlement.""On Friday, Swedish mobile telecom-gear maker Ericsson (ERIC) said it sued Apple for patent infringement involving Ericsson's wireless communications patents and other inventions.Ericsson on Thursday filed two complaints with the International Trade Commission and seven complaints in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas against Apple asserting 41 patents covering many aspects of Apple's iPhones and iPads. The patents include standard essential patents related to the 2G and 4G/LTE standards as well as patents critical to the features and functionality of Apple devices, such as chip design, user interface software, location services and applications, and the iOS operating system.Ericsson is seeking exclusion orders in the ITC proceedings and damages and injunctions in the federal court actions.""Apple's products benefit from the technology invented and patented by Ericsson's engineers,"" Kasim Alfalahi, chief intellectual property officer at Ericsson, said in a statement. ""Features that consumers now take for granted — like being able to livestream television shows or access their favorite apps from their phone — rely on the technology we have developed. We are committed to sharing our innovations and have acted in good faith to find a fair solution. Apple currently uses our technology without a license and therefore we are seeking help from the court and the ITC.""Apple stock was down more than 1% to below 129 in afternoon trading on the stock market today.

233,TEL,"In its ""Global Application & Network Security Report"" for 2014-15, Radware called 2014 ""a watershed year"" for the cybersecurity industry, one in which cyberattacks ""reached a tipping point"" in terms of their quantity, length, complexity and targets.Radware (RDWR) should know. It provides integrated application delivery and network security hardware for enterprises ranging from banks and insurers to manufacturers, retailers, telecoms, government agencies, media firms and service providers.The company's core product provides load balancing, traffic management, application performance monitoring and network security. Its website boasts that it offers ""complete security of business critical applications"" for around 10,000 enterprises and carriers worldwide. Its partners include Check Point Software Technologies (CHKP) and Juniper Networks (JNPR).In addition to helping businesses improve productivity and profitability, and lower IT operating and infrastructure costs, Radware's cybersecurity and application delivery solutions are designed to help customers secure and manage network traffic.Safety Is SellingThe security end of the business has become ""a very hot market"" for Radware, says Chief Financial Officer Meir Moshe.""President Obama even talked about how this is a nationwide challenge following the attack on Sony, which he said came in from North Korea,"" Moshe told IBD in a phone interview from his Tel Aviv office. ""Companies need to be protected against cybersecurity attacks, and so we've seen an acceleration of growth in this market.""Radware's technology is designed to recognize potential threats in a network's traffic and block them before they have a chance to do any damage, Moshe says. That requires sophisticated gear that can analyze anomalies in traffic so that ""only legitimate traffic"" flows into the network.One such product, a new version of Radware's DefensePro platform, was launched this month. It is designed to help high-end cloud service providers mitigate sophisticated attacks by providing more security capacity.""Security in the cloud is our main focus for 2015,"" Moshe said. ""We have put a lot of resources into this because it is a very high-demand and growing market.""Analysts likewise have a bullish outlook on the cybersecurity market, as well as Radware's growth opportunities in it.New ServicesIn a research note, Imperial Capital analyst Michael Kim said he anticipates ""continued strong growth driven by increasing demand"" for Radware's security solutions.""We see particular opportunities for broadening deployments of application security and data center protection solutions, with potential upside from new cloud security services — e.g., managed attack mitigation and web application firewall,"" Kim noted.Buckingham Research analyst Rohit Chopra calls Radware ""one of the most compelling hybrid ways to play strong secular trends in security.""He expects Radware to increase R&D; and other spending as a way to capture new cybersecurity opportunities as well as prepare for a new partnership with a still-unnamed original equipment manufacturer (OEM) that Chopra says will likely be a ""large networking provider.""Partnership PlanningMoshe would not divulge the name of the OEM, though he did confirm that the OEM will be identified during the second quarter and that revenue from the relationship will start coming in during the second half of the year.Financially, Radware continues to bounce back from a sluggish 2013, when it reported lower earnings and only a slight increase in sales. Part of the problem then was fierce competition that drove down prices, Moshe says.Thanks to a bigger emphasis on higher-margin security products, Radware has now posted four straight quarters of double-digit sales and earnings growth, the first time that's happened since 2012.On Jan. 28, Radware reported fourth-quarter earnings of 28 cents a share, up from 22 cents a year earlier and a penny above the consensus view of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. Revenue climbed 15% to $61 million, also slightly above estimates.The company's operating margins expanded to 22% at the end of 2014 from 14% at the end of the year.Radware's stock price sank 12% to 19.72 after it guided Q1 sales and earnings at the low end of analyst expectations. Shares have since regained some ground and currently trade near 22.For the full year, Radware's EPS grew 25% to 86 cents while revenue climbed 15% to $222 million — the biggest annual top-line gain since 2011.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Radware to increase 2015 earnings by 20% to $1.03 a share and revenue by 12% to $247.9 million.""By focusing on high-performance capabilities, tight integration of multiple services and multiple deployment options, Radware is carving out a defensible portion of the application delivery assurance market,"" D.A. Davidson analyst Mark Kelleher noted in a research report.He reckons Radware's ""continued innovation"" will let the company ""expand its addressable market and maintain mid-teens top-line growth for at least the next three years.""Radware has an IBD Composite Rating of 95, factoring in metrics such as earnings growth and stock-price gains. It belongs to IBD's Computer-Networking industry group, which ranks No. 45 in performance among 197 tracked.Radware is the top-rated stock in the group. Other high-rated stocks in the group include QLogic (QLGC), Arista Networks (ANET) and Ruckus Wireless (RKUS).

251,TEL,"Mideast: Tehran told U.S. diplomats to tell Israel to ""await the consequences"" for killing one of its generals. The radical state the president thinks will abandon nuclear weapons development treats the U.S. as its courier service.We learned this week from Megyn Kelly's Fox News interview with State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki that Secretary of State John Kerry is a ""hugger.""Kerry had just gone to Paris the week after missing the anti-terrorism march he should have gone to, and told the French: ""I really wanted to come here and share a hug with all of Paris.""We can probably expect hugging if the U.S. and its partners finally get a nuclear deal with Iran, but the Iranians this week once again reminded us that evil can't be caressed into good.Tehran's Deputy Foreign Minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian confided to the official Iranian news agency on Tuesday that, using diplomatic channels, ""we told the Americans that the leaders of the Zionist regime should await the consequences of their act"" of killing an Iranian general.Abdollahian added sarcastically, in a reference to President Obama's called bluff on chemical weapons in Syria, ""the Zionist regime has crossed our red lines.""A Jan. 18 airstrike in the Golan Heights, almost certainly conducted by Israeli jets, killed Gen. Mohammad Ali Allahdadi, along with a half-dozen Iranian-backed Hezbollah terrorists.The ""consequences"" threatened against the Jewish state for the bombing are likely not to resemble a hug; if Iran today had nuclear weapons, Tel Aviv might find itself within the embrace of a mushroom cloud.Hugging our adversaries into submission seems to be a favorite State Department diplomatic tool these days. As the Washington Free Beacon reports, high-ranking Muslim Brotherhood-aligned opponents of Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi of Egypt this week came to Foggy Bottom and had what one called ""fruitful"" talks with the Obama administration.This is the same Muslim Brotherhood whose strategic goal, according to a 1991 memorandum by one of its operatives, is ""eliminating and destroying the Western civilization from within and sabotaging its miserable house by their hands and the hands of the believers so that it is eliminated and God's religion is made victorious over all other religions.""One member of the Muslim Brotherhood delegation posted a smiling photo of himself online within the corridors of the State Department, holding up four fingers to make the pro-terrorist Rabia sign before the U.S. Great Seal. The Egyptian government considers the sign a terrorist symbol and inflicts legal punishment on those who use it.So the Obama administration entertains Egyptian jihadists because it thinks — hopes? — they might get back into power. But the president won't meet with our ally in Israel, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, when he visits Washington to address Congress in a few weeks. It claims a meeting would inappropriately affect Israel's upcoming election.When a major world power doesn't know what it stands for or whom it stands with, it stops being taken seriously. No wonder the Iranians now mistake America for the hired help and hand us messages to deliver.

281,TEL,"Middle East: What is the U.S. doing turning the screws on our most loyal ally in the region, with the Federal Aviation Administration used as a wrench? Have we forgotten the real enemy?Secretary of State John Kerry flies in to Tel Aviv on Wednesday, amidst heavy fighting between Israel and Hamas terrorists, to give an earful to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. He may have met with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas too in his frantic ""shuttle diplomacy.""But we all know who the administration believes is the instigator of this latest chapter of the conflict.After all, we didn't hear the president or the State Department over the last few days ask Hamas to avoid killing civilians — though that's pretty much what Hamas does, with innocent victims being both Jews and Arabs. That scolding was saved for Israel, the country that drops leaflets warning Arab civilians to flee for safety.Netanyahu reportedly let Kerry know he resented the FAA's ban on flights into Tel Aviv, since rescinded, judging it to be a political move aimed at pressuring Israel to agree to halt hostilities.Kerry meanwhile praised Abbas ""for his leadership, for his deep engagement in the effort to try to find a cease-fire."" Shouldn't Netanyahu be praised for his leadership in the self-defense of his people, upon whom rockets have been raining down?In spite of our ever-shuttling secretary, expectations for peace right now are close to nil. And for a glaringly obvious reason: U.S. power, prestige and moral authority are on the wane.Barack Obama came into office promising a diplomatic prowess never encountered before in world history.Over tea with the president of Iran he would persuade a regime sworn to wage war on America and wipe out its Zionist enemy to abandon its nuclear weapons ambitions.He would divert resources from the ""dumb war"" in Iraq to win the crucial war in Afghanistan; he might even invade Pakistan, he warned. We ended up losing both wars.Iraq is a disaster, with an al-Qaida offshoot forming a new caliphate across parts of both Syria and Iraq. Meanwhile, the Taliban are both warring and PR-ing their way back toward a return to power in Afghanistan.The president's ""New Beginning"" with the Muslim Mideast hasn't persuaded Hamas, or the Taliban, or Iran's ayatollah, or the region's myriad new al-Qaida mutations to get civilized and stop waging jihad against Americans, Europeans and Israelis.The new American stance — global weakness in the face of enemies, combined with betrayal of friends and allies — has, however, made it harder for us to get Israel to follow our wishes. Earlier this year, Obama became so desperate he even floated releasing convicted Israeli spy Jonathan Pollard. Netanyahu wasn't buying.The Mideast, as complex as it is in its particulars, is in essence a contest between Western civilization and violent Islamist chaos. This administration has forgotten which side America is on.

But Delta shares rose 3.6% to 39.04 in the stock market today, moving back above their 50-day moving average.""It was an outstanding quarter,"" CRT Capital analyst Michael Derchin told IBD. ""(Delta was) hitting on all cylinders.""He added that Delta's Q2 adjusted operating margins of 15.1% were ahead of CRT's estimates for 14.5%, with the Q3 guidance for operating margins of 15% to 17% better than expected.Delta had expected an operating margin of 14%-16% for the quarter ended in June.The airline said its passenger revenue rose 9% and passenger unit revenue increased 5.7%, while cargo revenue dipped 1%.""A solid demand environment, coupled with higher revenues from our corporate contract gains, merchandising efforts, and investments in New York and Seattle, helped offset weakness in Pacific yields and resulted in a nearly 6% increase in Delta's unit revenues for the June quarter,"" said Delta President Ed Bastian in a release.United Continental (UAL), American Airlines (AAL), Southwest Airlines (LUV), Alaska Air (ALK) and JetBlue Airways (JBLU) all report Thursday. Shares of all five carriers rallied Wednesday morning.On Tuesday, Delta and others temporarily suspended service to Israel following an FAA warning about a rocket attack near Ben Gurion International Airport. A Delta Boeing (BA) flight to Tel Aviv had to divert to Paris earlier that day.Follow Elaine Low on Twitter at @IBD_ELow.RELATED:U.S. Airlines Seen Cruising Past European Peers' Woes.

295,TEL,"Iran: Secretary of State John Kerry is working oh-so-hard in Vienna for a nuclear weapons deal with Tehran. Whether our nation's top diplomat gets one or not, the talks have been a dangerous waste of time.In what the New York Times on Tuesday called ""an indication of the complexity of the talks and Mr. Kerry's negotiating style"" the Newspaper of Record reported that ""immediately after his news conference he launched into a meeting with Catherine Ashton, the foreign policy chief for the European Union, and then yet another meeting with Mohammad Javad Zarif, Iran's foreign minister, his fourth in three days.""What a shame it would be, we apparently are supposed to think, if these arduous negotiations with Iran — which looked like a slam dunk to so many last November — were to fail.In fact, all these months the U.S. and Europe have spent talking to Iran have taken our eyes off the ball on what Iran is really up to: becoming the greatest nuclear threat to the world since the Soviet Union.The negotiations' success would probably be worse than their failure.As former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton told Fox News on Tuesday, President Obama is under the delusional impression that the fanatical Islamofascist regime can be both nuclear and unthreatening, that we can ""leave them with only a peaceful nuclear power and research program.""Tehran's position is that under any agreement it be allowed to develop sophisticated centrifuges; Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei insists Iran might ""need"" tens of thousands of centrifuges.This from the country with, at 150 billion barrels, the third largest amount of proven oil reserves in the world, and no need for nuclear power at all.Kerry contended that there is ""no question"" Iran is entitled to a nuclear program: ""What we are trying to do is find a way for Iran to have an exclusively peaceful nuclear program while giving the world all the assurances required to know that Iran is not seeking a nuclear weapon.""And he claimed, ""I want to underscore: These goals are not incompatible. In fact, they are realistic. But we have not yet found the right combination or arrived at the workable formula.""Substitute Nazi Germany for Iran and it becomes clear how absurd such a notion is.What happens if the July 20 deadline passes is that a new deadline gets activated, possibly six months or maybe a shorter time.Which means more time for Iranian nuclear weaponization while perfecting the missiles upon which an atomic bomb could destroy Tel Aviv or, some day, a European city.""These are tough negotiations,"" Kerry tells us, and ""very real gaps remain,"" and presumably we're all supposed to root for him to come home with a glorious signed piece of paper.Empathy may be one of Obama's criteria for Supreme Court nominees, but feeling for the secretary of state in a Vienna negotiating room is a fool's errand.How many times has the loser of the 2004 presidential campaign lost in the diplomatic sphere since he replaced Hillary Clinton at Foggy Bottom last year?Let us count the ways.He couldn't get an Israeli-Palestinian agreement.He couldn't get an agreement with Afghanistan on legal immunity for U.S. forces.And an idiotic slip of the tongue on Syria's chemical weapons led to Russian ruler Vladimir Putin gladly stepping in to fill the growing vacuum of U.S. power and prestige in the Mideast.Barring Israel bombing Tehran's nuclear facilities to smithereens, which may end up as the only real solution, Kerry will also lose on Iran, no matter how these talks pan out.Because with or without a pact, a nuclear-armed ayatollah will remain a continued threat to the U.S. and the rest of the West.

326,TEL,"Many of you were no doubt busy at work these past 24 hours or seeking work or giving up seeking work. So we've thoughtfully assembled a quick update of the more important news during this period:Russian President Vladimir Putin sent his reply to President Obama's demand to rein in Russian insurgents scorching eastern Ukraine. Using Putin's Buk missiles, the rebels downed two more Ukrainian fighter jets; one pilot was killed, the other ejected over insurgents and his fate can only be guessed.Crash investigators arrived in the same area to poke through what's left of the Malaysian passenger jet wreckage downed by a previous Russian Buk. Their work was hampered by continuous fighting.The first few dozen victim's bodies arrived back in the Netherlands, the downed flight's origin, and thousands silently lined streets as hearses passed.In Iraq, the last living Christians were ejected from Mosul, where people of their faith were living 600 years before Islam arrived. Last week, the terrorist army ISIS, consolidating control now over large regions of Iraq and Syria, said they all must leave, convert or die. Their homes and belongings were confiscated.ISIS executions of Shiites, soldiers and others continued, while international experts predicted a full assault on Baghdad to mark the end of the holy month of Ramadan next week.In Syria, international observers said the civil war had seen the bloodiest 48 hours since 2011 with more than 700 dying.In Gaza, heavy fighting continued between an Israeli incursion force bent on destroying terrorist tunnels into Israel and Hamas.United Nations officials found a second cache of deadly Hamas rockets stored in a civilian UN school. As an international organization dedicated to peace, UN authorities returned the weapons to the Hamas fighter, who weren't busy parading wounded human shields for TV cameras.More Hamas rockets were fired blindly into Israel, most of them met by anti-rocket fire. Secy. of State John Kerry took a break from talking fruitlessly to Iran's nuclear weapons negotiators to continue talking fruitlessly with Palestinian authorities about a proposed Egyptian ceasefire that Israel already accepted.The Federal Aviation Administration lifted its strange two-day ban on U.S. commercial jets flying into Tel Aviv, where usual air traffic had continued.On Capitol Hill, the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee voted 14-0 to confirm Bob McDonald, a former Army officer and Procter & Gamble CEO, as secretary of the scandal-plagued Veterans Administration.In Florida, Marine veteran Jeffrey Duck patiently waited more than three hours at a VA clinic for his prescription refill. Then, he phoned 911. The reason: Duck realized the entire clinic staff had gone home for the night and locked him inside. VA officials promised to review procedures, not on serving waiting vets faster, but on how they go about closing.Meanwhile, despite all these international and domestic distractions, Obama bravely carried on with his intense party fundraising duties. He's doing six fundraisers in three days in the Democrats' main West Coast political ATM's of Seattle, San Francisco and Los Angeles.To give you a flavor of the commander-in-chief's remarks, here are excerpts from his Wednesday evening speech to 450 supporters in the luxurious home of Shonda Rimes:""Hello, everybody. Hello, Los Angeles. Oh, this is a nice looking crowd. You all got dressed up. Don’t you look cute? Everybody, have a seat.....It is good to be in Los Angeles. Let me first of all say thank you to Shonda for opening up this unbelievable space and arranging for perfect weather. Give Shonda a big round of applause.....We love Shonda.""Kerry Washington I want to thank.....She didn’t jump on the (Obama) bandwagon. She pushed when the wagon was stuck in the mud ....She’s just been a great friend. Plus she showed me her baby pictures, and that is one cute baby. And I want to thank her and the entire host committee for helping to set this up.""My girl, Janelle Monae. Janelle has performed at the White House, like, 15 times.....Michelle and I love Janelle..... I have to say nice things about her because she may be the only person in possession of a video in which I try to keep up with her and Usher on the dance floor. Now, this is top secret. She has promised that this will never be released.....Now, tell the truth though, Janelle. I wasn’t bad, though, was I? I’m just saying.""Obama said for some reason, ""People across the country still feel anxious. And the question is, why?"" He traced the anxiety to stagnant wages and the House of Representatives.He said Americans ""are concerned about some of the turmoil that’s taking place around the world. And they look at the Middle East and they see a transition from an old order to a new order, and they’re not sure how that’s going to happen, and the terrible violence that occurs as a result.""But Obama said never mind deadly violence, ""the conflict that probably makes people most discouraged is the conflict they see in Washington, where members of Congress can’t seem to do anything; where all we hear about is gridlock, and all we hear about is posturing, and all we hear about are phony scandals.""The Democrat reassured his audience, most of whom paid thousands of dollars, ""I don’t think it’s an exaggeration to say that by almost every economic measure we’re better off now"" than five years ago.

332,TEL,"Palo Alto Networks (PANW) is expected late Wednesday to report triple-digit earnings growth for the second consecutive quarter, but revenue growth is forecast to hit record deceleration.For its fiscal Q4 2015, the consensus of 34 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters sees Palo Alto Networks pulling in 25 cents earnings per share ex items, up 127% vs. the year-earlier quarter. Revenue is forecast to increase 44% up to $256.25 million.While still robust, the revenue increase would be Palo Alto Networks' smallest percentage gain since the company's IPO in December 2010. Over the past year, the Silicon Valley firm has posted revenue growth above the 50%-mark every quarter.Santa Clara, Calif.-based Palo Alto Networks has handily beat consensus earnings and revenue estimates every quarter this year.Wall Street's Q4 forecast mostly mirrored the company's. During its Q3 earnings conference call, Palo Alto Networks guided to between 24 and 25 cents non-GAAP EPS on $252 million to $256 million in revenue.CEO Mark McLaughlin expressed revenue optimism during a recent company sales event, Wells Fargo analyst Gray Powell wrote in a research report.McLaughlin claimed revenue would breach $2 billion over the next two years, Powell wrote.The growth will happen organically, McLaughlin said. But, Powell points out, analysts don't see Palo Alto Networks nearing the $2 billion line. For the year, the consensus models $900.6 million in revenue.""PANW's unofficial target is some 20% above current Street forecasts and implies 40% per year growth vs. the Street (estimate) at 29% for the next two years,"" Powell wrote.Powell acknowledged the comments were likely aspirational, but ""we view the fact they were made just three weeks after the close of FQ4 '15 as an indication that current trends remain strong.""The company's position on Wall Street hasn't been strong recently, however. Palo Alto Networks stock has declined 18% over the past six weeks vs. the Nasdaq drop of 8%.Powell saw the silver lining.""We think this creates a compelling entry point into a high quality/high growth security company that benefits from favorable secular trends,"" he wrote.Palo Alto Networks' marketing efforts have paid off, Powell wrote. Currently, the marketing focus is on endpoint software Traps, the next generation firewall and WildFire, a cloud-based malware analysis machine, he wrote.Powell maintained his outperform rating on Palo Alto Networks stock.Palo Alto Networks closed up fractionally Friday at 162.39. With the market in a correction, Palo Alto stock dropped 3.3% for the week after hitting a four-month low at 140.39 on Aug. 24.The same day, IBD's Computer Software-Security industry group fell 3.4%, hitting a seven-month low.Palo Alto Networks leads the group with a 97 Composite Rating out of a best-possible 99.

333,TEL,"Betrayal: The Obama administration is playing a perfidious game with longtime Mideast ally Israel. While expressing ""strong support"" for the Israelis' self-defense, it subtly accuses them of civilian atrocities.'Eat not with an envious man, and desire not his meats,"" the Old Testament proverb warns. ""His mind is not with thee. The meats which thou hadst eaten thou shalt vomit up.""That jarring Bible passage might come to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's mind as he thinks of the decades of unwavering support that his Jewish state gave to the U.S. during the Cold War, standing firmly against the Soviet Union as it sought dominance in the Arab Middle East.Now the mind of the leader of Israel's once-staunch ally is not with Israel, though some of his words are.President Obama gives lip service to America's commitment to Israel. But when it really matters, he morally undercuts the Israelis' efforts at self-preservation.""I reaffirmed my strong support for Israel's right to defend itself,"" the president last week said of a phone conversation with Netanyahu. ""No nation should accept rockets being fired into its borders or terrorists tunneling into its territory.""Obama even noted that ""sirens went off in Tel Aviv"" as he and Netanyahu spoke.What the world took from his full statement, however, was not a message of support. What it heard was the president's crack a few seconds later about hoping that Israel ""minimizes civilian casualties.""Last weekend, the White House reported that Obama on Sunday ""raised serious concern"" about ""increasing Palestinian civilian deaths in Gaza"" with Netanyahu.The new message, alien to previous presidencies, Democrat and Republican alike, is that even America can't really defend the Zionist state, its hands soaked in innocent civilian blood.As Netanyahu told Fox News' Brit Hume last week: ""Here's the difference between us: We're using missile defense to protect our civilians, and they're using their civilians to protect their missiles.""Hamas, which has been firing rockets at population centers in Israel for years, conceals missile launchers in homes and in schools. Just on Monday, launchers, some loaded with rockets ready to fire, were found on the grounds of an agricultural school in Gaza.The minimal civilian casualties in Israel are thanks to its Iron Dome missile defense, its numerous air-raid shelters and many years of civilian training on getting into those shelters before the rockets hit.Netanyahu asked Americans ""to imagine the United States being bombarded not in one city or two cities, but in every city between New York and Colorado."" ""No country,"" he said, ""can accept that.""A country 263 miles long, whose width ranges from about 70 miles to less than 10 miles at its narrowest point, most certainly can't live with rocket fire on its main airport, which is what major airlines such as Delta, Air France, Lufthansa and KLM are thinking in suspending service into and out of the country.There was supposed to be a diplomatic harvest that came from the U.S. distancing itself from Israel as part of Obama's ""New Beginning"" with the Muslim world.But at a time when it is more important than ever for the U.S. to be able to depend on friendly Arab powers to oppose Islamist terrorism, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan — expected to be elected president next month — last weekend accused Israel of ""barbarism that surpasses Hitler."" This week Erdogan disclosed that he refuses to speak to Obama on the phone.The Israeli-Hamas war is another example of waning U.S. influence making conflict worse. Israel and all the Arab world alike know that, in both word and deed, America can no longer be trusted as a friend — or feared as an adversary.

""The enterprise security market has been changing rapidly in the last few years, with the number of sophisticated attacks showing a lasting and growing phenomenon.""For the quarter ended April 30, revenue rose 49% from the year-earlier quarter to $150.7 million, beating the $146.2 million consensus estimate of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters.The company reported earnings per share minus items of 11 cents, up 83% and beating analyst views by a penny.Under the terms of the legal settlement, Palo Alto Networks will make a one-time payment to Juniper of $75 million in cash and $100 million in shares of common stock and warrants to purchase common stock.March MistrialJuniper had filed suit in December 2011, claiming Palo Alto Networks' products infringed on six Juniper patents. In March, U.S. District Court Judge Sue Robinson declared a mistrial in the case.Based in Santa Clara, Calif., Palo Alto Networks is a leading developer of next-generation technology used to protect company networks from virus attacks, malware and other security breaches. Its products include network firewall software and appliances. It also offers subscription services for threat detection and prevention, URL filtering, and mobile device security.Palo Alto's stock slipped a bit in Wednesday's regular session to 69.51, 14% off its all-time high of 80.84, reached on March 18.Investor expectations have been high for a company that pioneered next-generation firewall security protection in reaction to businesses' and employees' increasingly using applications available via the Internet cloud, making corporate networks more vulnerable.Its rivals include FireEye (FEYE), Checkpoint Software (CHKP), Cisco Systems (CSCO) and Fortinet (FTNT).The company guided revenue for the current quarter at $158 million to $162 million, up 42% at the midpoint and above the consensus estimate of $158.4 million.It expects earnings per share minus items of 10 or 11 cents. Analysts had modeled 10 cents.Q3 billings rose 46% to $193.9 million. Product revenue rose 38% to $84.1 million. Recurring subscription revenue rose 71% to $32 million, and deferred revenue rose 68% to $367.9 million. Both revenues set records.In the quarter, Palo Alto Networks completed its acquisition of Cyvera, a privately held cybersecurity company based in Tel Aviv, Israel, for $200 million in cash and stock. Cyvera has developed technology that aims to protect enterprise users from cyberattacks and threats on any device, across any network. Analysts said Cyvera will expand Palo Alto Networks' total addressable market by $4 billion to $5 billion, on top of its current addressable market of $15 billion to $20 billion.

411,TEL,"Software-defined networking is moving to the big bucks stage.Annual global spending by Internet, telecom and other service providers on SDN systems — where software takes a more prominent role in network management — will soar above $15 billion in 2018, with a compounded annual growth rate above 90%, says a new study.The findings by ACG Research, released last month, track above two separate estimates of SDN spending by the other main buyers of the technology, enterprises.The ACG report is good news for companies moving fast into SDN, including VMware (VMW), Cisco Systems (CSCO) and Juniper Networks (JNPR), as well as a rising number of startups, says Paul Parker-Johnson, ACG's practice leader.""Cisco, Juniper, VMware and Alcatel Lucent (ALU), and to some degree even Red Hat (RHT) and Hewlett-Packard (HPQ), may be players, and it's also going to be a mixture of brand-new companies that have made the transition,"" he said.In 2018, ACG says, service provider spending on SDN systems will reach $15.6 billion, up from $626 million last year.No other projections of service provider SDN spending could be found, but two outfits have projectted SDN spending by enterprises.Market tracker IDC pegged annual global SDN spending by enterprise companies at $3.7 billion in 2016, while Pacific Crest Securities forecast $2.2 billion in spending that year. The ACG study has service provider SDN spending in 2016 at $3.9 billion, with a 146% jump forecast for 2017 and another 62.5% rise in 2018.Service providers might be the most demanding market because they answer to a wide range of consumer and business customers, says Parker-Johnson. For them, the need for speed is perpetual.""There is no observable sign that we are decreasing the amount of applications we want to consume — people want their video when they want it and they want their news when they want it,"" he said.IDC analyst Rohit Mehra says the projection is higher than he would have expected. Service providers usually lag enterprises ""in terms of changing infrastructures and technologies,"" he said. ""If you combine the telecom routers and the switches and the optical and the wireless gear globally, $15 billion sounds a little high to me, but it's not out of the ball park.""SDN is billed as providing a more flexible network that can move data faster and more efficiently than before. It requires a combination of hardware and software to be effective, says Parker-Johnson.The vendors pursuing SDN ""are providing really elegant software to enable the applications at the controller level, and so a company like Juniper or Cisco is going to be making money off both the software and the hardware,"" he said.As data and cloud computing explode, service providers need ever faster and more flexible networksAnother challenge for service providers is keeping up with mobile users and apps, Parker-Johnson says. ""It's causing the operators to look for ways to scale up their networks,"" he said.Less Than $1 Billion This YearThe ACG study projects service provider SDN spending at $777 million this year, jumping to $1.67 billion in 2015, $3.9 billion in 2016 and $9.6 billion in 2017.Sales will accelerate as more service providers realize they need to upgrade their hardware to better accommodate SDN software, Parker-Johnson says.""The reason the growth is so steep is that the application providers and the Internet service providers not only want to deliver their applications and use this really cool software that is controlling the infrastructure, they are also going to be buying switches and routers that are being evolved so they can work with SDN,"" he said.Cisco, VMware and Juniper will also be competing with Ericsson (ERIC) and Nokia (NOK) in SDN revenues, says Parker-Johnson. ""You have some international firms from a network infrastructure point of view going hard after SDN and network virtualization for mobile infrastructures,"" he said.Last year, Cisco developed its first SDN hardware and software products and expects to start shipping them soon. Some analysts have said SDN could hurt Cisco, Juniper and other networking hardware makers. Parker-Johnson says the ACG study suggests otherwise.IDC's Mehra says the jury is out until at least 2015. It's too early to expect SDN to become a revenue boon for companies like Cisco and Juniper overnight, he says.""Many customers are still in the process of sorting out what SDN means to them, so there is not necessarily hundreds of millions of dollars in deals that Cisco would get for SDN,"" Mehra said.

413,TEL,"The earnings season has already started and the picture, so far, appears to be encouraging. Per the Earnings Preview dated Jan 19, nearly 53 of the S&P 500 members have reported their results. Out of these companies, approximately 81.1% delivered positive earnings surprises, while 75.5% surpassed top-line expectations.Notably, earnings for the 53 S&P 500 companies have advanced 11.7% from the same period last year, with revenues up 7.5%. Further, the report suggests that earnings for the total S&P 500 companies for the fourth quarter are projected to improve 10.3% year over year, with total revenues increasing 7.1%.Tech Stocks Continue to OutperformTechnology is one of the six sectors anticipated to report double-digit earnings growth. The other five are Oil/Energy, Basic Materials, Industrial Products, Construction and Autos. Various technology giants, including Intel (INTC  -  Free Report) and Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report), are scheduled to report their numbers this week. Per the report, total earnings for the tech sector are projected to be up 14.3% on 8.7% higher revenues.We note that the technology sector has been a robust performer over the past year. The sector is benefiting from the increasing demand for cloud-based platforms, growing adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions, Augmented/Virtual reality devices, autonomous cars, advanced driver assisted systems (ADAS) and Internet of Things (IoT) related software.Not All Companies are Poised to ImpressThough the overall tech sector is poised to shine in the quarter to be reported, this does not ensure earnings beat for all companies in the space. It should be noted that a company’s earnings outperformance is dependent on the overall business environment as well as management’s ability to implement operating and strategic plans.In other words, a company may perform poorly despite a favorable business environment if it fails to capitalize on the opportunities due to lack of execution.Let’s See How LRCX, TEL, APH, XLNX and FFIV are PlacedSupplier of wafer fabrication equipment and services, Lam Research Corporation (LRCX  -  Free Report), is set to report second-quarter fiscal 2018 results.

414,TEL,"TE Connectivity Ltd. (TEL  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter fiscal 2018 results before the opening bell on Jan 24.TE Connectivity has an excellent earnings surprise history, with an average positive surprise of 9.7% in the trailing four quarters. The company recorded its eight consecutive earnings beat in the last reported quarter, surpassing estimates by 7.8%. In the quarter to be reported, the company is expected to report strong revenues in Transportation Solutions business, which constitutes more than half of its total revenues.We expect TE Connectivity to score an earnings beat in the to-be-reported quarter.Why a Likely Positive Surprise? Our proven model shows that TE Connectivity has the right combination of the two key ingredients. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is perfectly the case here as you will see below:Zacks ESP: TE Connectivity has an Earnings ESP of +0.26%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.TE Connectivity Ltd. Price and EPS Surprise TE Connectivity Ltd. Price and EPS Surprise | TE Connectivity Ltd. QuoteZacks Rank: The company carries a Zacks Rank #3, which when combined with a positive ESP, makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Conversely, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Ranks #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.Factors Driving the Better-than-Expected ResultsTE Connectivity is now poised to grow on the back of strong demand in end markets, along with its overarching business model and continued progress on strategic priorities. The company’s Commercial transportation business is showing remarkable signs of progress, driven by the content expansion in the heavy truck market, especially in China. Growth in electronic content and a rich pipeline of platform ramps from design wins bode well for its transportation business. Additionally, the sensor business is anticipated to see strong design win momentum, fueled by the growth of automotive space, which is likely to prove conductive to upcoming results.Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from the Transportation Solutions segment in the to-be-reported quarter currently remains high at $1,867 million compared with fiscal fourth-quarter revenues of $1,844 million. However, revenues from Industrial Solutions segment are anticipated to be low sequentially, with an estimate of $869 million compared with reported revenues of $954 million in the prior quarter.Moreover, being a market leader in the connectivity and sensor business, the company is armed with a comprehensive portfolio that supplements its strength. About 80% of the company’s revenues are driven by harsh environment applications. Over the past five years, its harsh business applications have experienced mid-single digit growth, driving top-line growth. Going forward, we believe that this business will provide ample opportunities of margin expansion.This apart, the company’s ardent eye for acquisitions is anticipated to be conducive to core business, going forward. The company’s buyout of MicroGroup and agreement to acquire Hirschmann Car Communication enhanced its harsh environment portfolio and are expected to drive first-quarter fiscal sales as well.However, primarily dependent on end market dynamics the company’s business is subject to cyclical risks that the end markets suffer. Though the company has witnessed some stability in direct business with OEMs, poor sales through distribution channels are taking longer-than-expected recovery time, consequently hurting segmental performance. Additionally, the company’s weakness in commercial transportation market due to weak global construction and agriculture markets, along with weakness in the North America heavy truck markets, have been adding to woesFurther, sluggishness in oil and gas markets and its derivative impact on other industrial markets will likely act as strong headwinds for the company. Also, helicopter demand has also been impacted adversely, which can prove to be a drag on the company’s aerospace business. This apart, the company believes the supply chain inefficiencies can prove to be a drag on the earnings in the quarter under review.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are some other companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these too have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Analog Devices, Inc. (ADI  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.96% and a Zacks Rank #1.  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.AMTEK, Inc.

415,TEL,"Have you been paying attention to shares of Vishay Precision Group (VPG  -  Free Report)? Shares have been on the move with the stock up 16.8% over the past month. VPG hit a new 52-week high of $36.20 in the previous session. Vishay Precision Group has gained 42.1% since the start of the year compared to the 6.4% move for the Computer and Technology sector and the -2.3% year-to-date return for its peer group.What's Driving the Outperformance?The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises, having beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on May 8, 2018, Vishay Precision Group reported EPS of $0.37 versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.33 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 9.6%.For the current fiscal year, Vishay Precision Group is expected to post earnings of $1.56 per share on $284.23 million in revenues. This represents a 36.84% change in EPS on a 11.75% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $1.79 per share on $294.23 million in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 15.06% and 3.52%, respectively.Valuation MetricsVishay Precision Group may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for VPG? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM score as well. The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.Vishay Precision Group has a Value Score of C. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are An and A, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of B.In terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 22.9X current fiscal year EPS estimates. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 18.3X versus its peer group's average of 15.7X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 1.15. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.Vishay Precision Group, Inc. Price and Consensus  Vishay Precision Group, Inc. Price and Consensus | Vishay Precision Group, Inc. QuoteZacks RankWe also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Vishay Precision Group currently has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Vishay Precision Group fits the bill. Thus, it seems as though VPG shares could have a bit more room to run in the near term.How Does Vishay Precision Group Stack Up to the Competition?Shares of Vishay Precision Group have been rising, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? Some of its industry peers are also impressive, including Novanta (NOVT  -  Free Report), OSI Systems (OSIS  -  Free Report), and TE Connectivity (TEL  -  Free Report), all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least #2 and a VGM Score of at least B, making them well-rounded choices.The Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 35% of all the industries we have in our universe, so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for VPG, even beyond its own solid fundamental situation.

Book-to-bill ratio was 1.03.Segmental PerformanceTransportation Solutions revenues came in at $2,134 million in the reported quarter, up 21.6% on a year-over-year basis. Organic growth in automotive, commercial transportation and sensors across all regions boosted the top line.Industrial Solutions revenues witnessed another strong quarter, rising 14% from the prior-year quarter to $972 million. The impressive growth was driven by strength in industrial equipment, Aerospace, Defense and Marine business.Communications Solutions revenues increased 3.2% year over year to $639 million. The increase was led by strength across all regions and businesses. The segment’s sales were boosted, somewhat, by strength in Asia in Data and Devices, partially offset by weakness in Subsea communications.The company’s adjusted gross margin in the reported quarter was 33.2%, down from the prior-year quarter.

The company’s fiscal 2018 earnings guidance and robust sales forecast are likely to go very well with investors, as it carries its growth momentum forward into fiscal 2018.Most of the company’s operating margin expansion in the past few years has been driven by the transportation segment.

419,TEL,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put TE Connectivity Ltd. (TEL  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, TE Connectivity has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 19.7, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 20.5. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, TE Connectivity’s current PE level puts it above its midpoint over the past five years, with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months.However, the stock’s PE also compares unfavorably with the broader industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 19.3. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively overvalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that TE Connectivity has a forward PE  ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 17.6, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for TE Connectivity stock in the near term too .P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, TE Connectivity has a P/S ratio of about 2.6. This is significantly lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.3x right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is a little below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, TE Connectivity currently has a Value Score of A, putting it into the top 20% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes TE Connectivity a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, the P/CF ratio (a great indicator of value) comes in at 13.9, which is far better than the industry average of 15.4. Clearly, TEL is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.What About the Stock Overall?Though TE Connectivity might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of B and a Momentum Score of B. This gives TEL a Zacks VGM score — or its overarching fundamental grade — of B. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been favorable. The current quarter has seen four estimates go higher in the past sixty days, while the full year estimate has seen five up in the same time period.This has had just a small impact on the consensus estimate though as the current year consensus estimate has increased 11.6% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has increased 3.7%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action  for the stock in the chart below:TE Connectivity Ltd. Price and Consensus   TE Connectivity Ltd. Price and Consensus | TE Connectivity Ltd. QuoteThis positive trend signifies bullish analyst sentiment, and its Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) indicates robust fundamentals and expectations of outperformance in the near term.Bottom LineTE Connectivity is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Furthermore, a strong industry rank (among Top 31% of more than 250 industries) and a Zacks Rank #2, boosts our confidence on the stock. In fact, over the past two, the broader industry has clearly outperformed the market at large, as you can see below:So, it might pay for value investors to delve deeper into the company’s prospects, as fundamentals indicate that this stock could be a compelling pickLooking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.     Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

422,TEL,"Have you been paying attention to shares of Stoneridge (SRI  -  Free Report)? Shares have been on the move with the stock up 18% over the past month. SRI hit a new 52-week high of $37.20 in the previous session. Stoneridge has gained 60.9% since the start of the year compared to the 5.7% move for the Computer and Technology sector and the -5.6% year-to-date return for its peer group.What's Driving the Outperformance?The stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises, having beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on May 2, 2018, Stoneridge reported EPS of $0.5 versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.48 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 6.16%.For the current fiscal year, Stoneridge is expected to post earnings of $2.11 per share on $876.36 million in revenues. This represents a 34.39% change in EPS on a 6.3% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $2.26 per share on $909.38 million in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 7.11% and 3.77%, respectively.Valuation MetricsStoneridge may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for SRI? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security).

Thus, it seems as though SRI shares could still be poised for more gains ahead.How Does Stoneridge Stack Up to the Competition?Shares of Stoneridge have been soaring, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? Some of its industry peers are also looking good, including Vishay Precision Group (VPG  -  Free Report), Novanta (NOVT  -  Free Report), and TE Connectivity (TEL  -  Free Report), all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least #2 and a VGM Score of at least B, making them well-rounded choices.The Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 13% of all the industries we have in our universe, so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for SRI, even beyond its own solid fundamental situation.

423,TEL,"Investors with an interest in Electronics - Miscellaneous Components stocks have likely encountered both TE Connectivity (TEL  -  Free Report) and BWX Technologies (BWXT  -  Free Report). But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now? Let's take a closer look.There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks, but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns. The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits.Right now, TE Connectivity is sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while BWX Technologies has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). This means that TEL's earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive, so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook. But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in.Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional, tried-and-true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors.TEL currently has a forward P/E ratio of 16.86, while BWXT has a forward P/E of 24.26. We also note that TEL has a PEG ratio of 1.54. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. BWXT currently has a PEG ratio of 2.21.Another notable valuation metric for TEL is its P/B ratio of 3.47. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, BWXT has a P/B of 17.92.Based on these metrics and many more, TEL holds a Value grade of A, while BWXT has a Value grade of D.TEL sticks out from BWXT in both our Zacks Rank and Style Scores models, so value investors will likely feel that TEL is the better option right now.

The company’s fiscal 2018 earnings guidance and robust sales forecast are likely to go very well with investors, as it carries its robust growth momentum into fiscal 2018.Most of the company’s operating margin expansion in the past few years have been driven by the transportation segment.

Overall, we believe strong demand in end markets, along with an overarching business model, will continue to drive TE Connectivity’s future growth.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderTE Connectivity carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader space include Kemet Corporation (KEM  -  Free Report), Universal Display Corporation (OLED  -  Free Report) and ZAGG Inc (ZAGG  -  Free Report), each sporting a Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy).

429,TEL,"Connectivity and sensor solutions manufacturer, TE Connectivity Ltd. (TEL  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Nov 1.TE Connectivity has an excellent earnings surprise history, with an average positive surprise of 9.5% in the trailing four quarters. The company scored its seventh consecutive earnings beat in the last reported quarter, beating estimates by 6%. However, the company anticipates weak revenues in Transportation Solutions in the upcoming quarter, which constitutes the major portion of its total revenues.Let's see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayPrimarily depended on end market dynamics, TE Connectivity’s business remains susceptible to cyclical risks that the end markets suffer. Though the company witnessed some extent of stability in direct business with OEMs, poor sales through distribution channels took longer-than-expected recovery time, consequently hurting the segmental performance. These factors could be a drag on segment margin and affect its profitability in the upcoming quarter.The company’s commercial transportation market is yet to witness signs of stabilization due to weak global construction and agriculture markets, along with weakness in the North America heavy truck markets. This apart, the company believes the supply chain inefficiencies can prove to be a drag on the earnings in the quarter under review. These factors can severely undermine TE Connectivity’s growth prospects.Moreover, sluggishness in oil and gas markets along with its derivative impact on other industrial markets will likely act as major headwinds for TE Connectivity. Further, helicopter demand has also been impacted negatively, which can prove to be a drag on the company’s aerospace business.Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from the Transportation Solutions segment in the to-be-reported quarter currently remains low at $1,670 million compared with fiscal third-quarter revenues of $1,765 million. Revenues from Industrial Solutions segment are also anticipated to be low sequentially, with an estimate of $880 million compared with reported revenues of $905 million in the prior quarter.However, being a market leader in the connectivity and sensor business, TE Connectivity is armed with a comprehensive portfolio that supplements its strength. About 80% of the company’s revenues are driven by harsh environment applications. In the past five years, the company’s harsh business applications have had experienced mid-single digit growth, driving top-line growth. Going forward, we believe that this business will provide ample opportunities of margin expansion in the upcoming quarter.Moreover, the company’s Commercial transportation business is showing remarkable signs of progress driven by the content expansion in the heavy truck market, especially in China. Growth in electronic content as well as a rich pipeline of platform ramps from design wins bode well for the company’s transportation business, going forward.Furthermore, during the previous quarter, the company enhanced its harsh environment portfolio with bolt-on acquisitions in the Automotive and Medical business by entering into an agreement to acquire Hirschmann Car Communication and purchasing MicroGroup. These acquisitions will unlock expansion opportunities, and advance content growth in key applications for the automotive and medical markets. This bodes well for the to-be-reported quarter’s top-line.  Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for TE Connectivity this time around. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

The company’s fiscal 2018 earnings guidance and robust sales forecast are likely to go very well with investors, as it carries its growth momentum forward into fiscal 2018.Most of the company’s operating margin expansion in the past few years have been driven by the transportation segment. Encouragingly, in recent times we observed that both, the Communications and Industrial segments, are contributing significantly to the operating margin expansion as well, thus adding to the company’s strength.We believe the previously-completed Creganna and Intercontec acquisitions will continue to unlock significant opportunities in the transportation and industrial segments. Overall, we believe strong demand in end markets, along with an overarching business model, will continue to drive TE Connectivity’s future growth.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderTE Connectivity carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader space include ZAGG Inc (ZAGG  -  Free Report), Universal Display Corporation (OLED  -  Free Report) and IntriCon Corporation (IIN  -  Free Report), each carrying a Zacks Rank of 2 (Buy).
