The duty comes just after government data showed that the American hog herd on March 1 reached a seasonal all-time high.

3,TSN,"Deere & Co. (DE) could be among the big losers in a China trade war as Beijing targets U.S. agricultural commodities, but the prospect of lower prices also boosted Hormel (HRL) and other food companies that could see lower costs.XChina said on Wednesday that it would slap tariffs on $50 billion worth of American imports, including soybeans, wheat, corn, cotton and other agricultural commodities. China imported $14 billion worth of soybeans from the U.S. last year.A range of agricultural commodity prices, including soybeans and corn, fell on fear that lower sales to China would create slack.If the American farmers who buy Deere equipment are hurt by China tariffs, they'll be slower to replace or upgrade old Deere equipment.On the flip side, weaker demand from China would hold crop prices lower.

The Dow Jones industrial rose a fraction, despite Apple's advance, as both IBM (IBM) and DuPont (DD) posted losses of more than 1%.Preliminary data showed trading volume was mixed, higher on the Nasaq, lower on the NYSE compared with Friday's quiet action.Monday opened with eyes on European markets, which were mixed but well-behaved after an uncertain final round of France's presidential election went to centrist candidate Emmanuel Macron. Macron had set markets surging April 24 with a surprise first-round win over nationalist candidate Marine Le Pen, but was heavily favored by polls ahead of Sunday's vote, and markets appeared to have priced in a Macron victory before Friday.But earnings, mergers and company news drove a wide range of dramatic moves Monday.Apple rose 3% in its best session since Feb. 1, taking a new high after regulatory filings showed Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKA) had amped up its stake in the stock to $19.2 billion by the end of March, from $7.1 billion at the end of December.In earnings news, Newell Brands (NWL) soared 12% to lead the S&P 500.

Other China-based internet plays posting strong gains Monday included Sina (SINA), Weibo (WB) and Bitauto Holdings (BITA).The two biggest losses on both the Nasdaq 100 and the S&P 500 were also driven by earnings.

Tyson Foods (TSN) dropped more than 6% to the low end of the S&P 500, after its fiscal second-quarter earnings stopped just short of analysts targets.Mergers news was also a factor, with Kate Spade (KATE) up 8% after agreeing to $2.4 billion takeover by Coach (COH).

"
28,TSN,"In October 1945, as he prepared to announce the signing of Jackie Robinson to break the color barrier in Major League Baseball, Branch Rickey visited his friend, the well-known broadcaster Lowell Thomas.""Branch, all hell will break loose!"" Thomas told Rickey, as recounted by Lee Lowenfish in ""Branch Rickey: Baseball's Ferocious Gentleman."" ""No, Lowell,"" Rickey replied. ""All heaven will rejoice.""Rickey, then the Brooklyn Dodgers' president and general manager, is remembered for his courage and foresight in breaking baseball's color line, the unofficial racial barrier which had stood firmly since the late 1800s. Robinson played his first game as a major leaguer 70 years ago this week.Rickey often said that he was drawn to the cause of racial equality when, in 1903, he observed Charles Thomas, the only black member of the Ohio Wesleyan University baseball team, being denied a hotel room in South Bend, Ind. ""I never felt so helpless in my life,"" said Rickey.A 1949 Newsweek profile noted that Rickey spent ""two intensely secretive years"" considering the implications of breaking baseball's color barrier, not even informing the Dodgers' scouting department of his potential move.""When Robinson was signed, it effectively opened up the biggest pool of talent in history,"" said Daniel R. Levitt, co-author with Mark L. Armour of ""In Pursuit of Pennants: Baseball Operations from Deadball to Moneyball.""Rickey's innovations are seen throughout baseball today. He established the first ""farm system"" for developing major league talent and encouraged the use of statistical analysis in evaluating players. He promoted modern training methods and equipment.More broadly, Rickey elevated and exemplified the baseball general manager position, a role that most often had been taken on by an owner or team president. Under Rickey, it would include everything from player development to scouting.Rickey left an ""unmatched resume in the game,"" wrote Armour.  ""As a general manager he dramatically changed how teams find and develop players, and what players are allowed to play the game. His place as the greatest GM in baseball history is secure.""Wesley Branch Rickey (1881-1965) was born in Stockdale, Ohio, to Frank and Emily Rickey. Lowenfish writes that the family had a ""hardscrabble existence,"" trying to subsist on a vegetable farm.Born into a pious family, Rickey's name derived from John Wesley, a founder of Methodism. The name ""Branch"" came from scripture, possibly from a passage in the Old Testament.Rickey studied at Ohio Wesleyan, arriving on campus as ""the picture of the hayseed,"" according to Lowenfish, and experienced a difficult transition. He made his mark on both the football and baseball fields, showing ""plenty of pep and ginger"" as a catcher.In 1903, Rickey witnessed the stellar performance of Charles Follis, who is believed to have been the first black professional football player. Follis' on-field achievements, combined with his poise in the face of racial pressures, impressed Rickey, planting a seed for his determination years later to integrate baseball.After signing a minor league baseball contract in 1903, Rickey debuted in the majors with the St. Louis Browns in 1905. His playing career over four seasons was pedestrian. While catching, he allowed a stunning 13 stolen bases in a single game, setting a dubious record. Following an arm injury and a bout of tuberculosis, Rickey enrolled at the University of Michigan Law School. He also became the baseball coach at Michigan.In 1913, Rickey became an executive for the Browns, signing future Hall of Famer George Sisler and later managing the team for more than two seasons. In 1919, Rickey joined the St. Louis Cardinals as team manager and president. In 1925, he was fired as manager by owner Sam Breadon, a serendipitous move which allowed Rickey to focus exclusively on being an executive.Rickey revamped the Cardinals' roster, laying the groundwork for six pennants and four World Series during his 24 seasons there. He quickly released players who did not meet his standards, turning around a previously mediocre franchise. Rickey acquired eventual stars Joe Medwick and brothers Dizzy and Daffy Dean, who shaped the Cardinals' ""Gashouse Gang"" in the 1930s.Though Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis was dismissive of Rickey's farm system, fearing it would destroy the existing structure, Rickey used it to great success.  The World Series-winning 1942 Cardinals were built with players Rickey's system developed, including Stan Musial, the best player in franchise history.Rickey reshaped the entire organization:""The farm system allowed Rickey to institute the 'Cardinal Way,' "" said Levitt.  ""It was an organizational philosophy extending from the lowest farmhands to the Major League team. It instituted organizationwide training techniques and defined what sort of players the team's scouts would seek.  There became a pride in being a Cardinal. Rickey was the first baseball executive to develop this kind of organizational framework.""Rickey joined the Dodgers before the 1943 season. The core players of Brooklyn's six World Series teams between 1947 and 1956 were acquired and developed under Rickey. With Brooklyn, Rickey hired the first team statistician, opened a team spring training facility in Vero Beach, Fla., and implemented new training techniques, including the use of pitching machines.Rickey was acutely aware that he needed to sign the right player to break baseball's color barrier.""Mr. Rickey knew he needed a superb player or the man wouldn't stand a chance,"" said Carl Erskine, a member of the Dodgers from 1948 through 1959 and a teammate of Jackie Robinson for nine seasons. ""Robinson was a four-letter man at UCLA. His best sport may have been football, not baseball.  And he had to be intelligent.  Jackie certainly was.""Mr. Rickey said to Jackie: 'If a fight starts on the field, I'm picking you. You're quicker, you're faster, and you're stronger. You're going to win the fight. But are you strong enough not to fight? You must tell me that you're willing to commit yourself not to fight.' When Jackie said, 'I think I can do it,' Mr. Rickey read to him a paraphrased version of 'Turn the Other Cheek,' a verse in the Bible, about having the courage to resist.""Rickey, according to Erskine, stressed the Christian faith of both of their mothers in making his plea and offer to Robinson. ""That was a critical moment, often unmentioned in history, when Jackie made the commitment.""Robinson, who debuted 70 years ago this week, was National League Rookie of the Year in 1947 and led Brooklyn to the World Series. Robinson's struggles and triumphs are an integral part of American history, and his importance to baseball and its growth is immense.Rickey encouraged Cleveland to sign Larry Doby, the first African-American to play in the American League, because he did not want to ""corner the market on black players,"" wrote Lowenfish.""Mr. Rickey unselfishly gave up a Hall of Famer for the American League to be integrated,"" said Erskine. ""That was selfless and is too often forgotten.""The African-American players whom Rickey signed, including Don Newcombe and Roy Campanella, were central to Brooklyn's success throughout the 1950s. After losing a power struggle, Rickey left the Dodgers for the Pittsburgh Pirates in 1950. While the team struggled during his time as general manager, Rickey acquired many of the top players on Pittsburgh's 1960 World Series-winning team, including Roberto Clemente.""There was no one quite as good at seeing greatness in raw talent,"" Lowenfish told IBD. ""In evaluating players and hiring quality scouts, nobody quite matches Rickey.""But, while his farm system allowed him to acquire players cheaply, ""he was hated because he made the money and the players didn't,"" said Lowenfish. Erskine said that Rickey was often referred to as El Cheapo, connoting a reputation for miserliness which Rickey had difficulty shaking, even though he sometimes spent profusely on players.Some suggested that Rickey's decision to sign Robinson also had underlying financial motivations.  Others criticized Rickey for never coming to the ballpark on Sundays, as he honored the Sabbath to pay homage to his mother.Erskine said that Rickey tested players, trying to learn how they processed information.""He helped many players excel, through his patience and his unique methods. In spring training, he used to talk to players as they worked out. He wanted to see if you had aptitude.""He had a $5 bill which he'd lay on home plate. He'd say: 'Son, I want you to throw the ball with your hand backwards to the plate. If you can hit that $5, you can have it.' He often gave us little tests which helped him make judgments about players. He wanted to know if you could learn unconventionally.""On Dec. 9, 1965, Rickey died at age 83 of heart failure in Columbia, Mo. Nearly a month earlier, he had collapsed while giving a speech during his induction to the Missouri Sports Hall of Fame and never regained consciousness. He was survived by his wife, Jane, and five daughters.""Mr. Rickey was a human dynamo,"" said Erskine. ""He truly kept going until he stopped.""Rickey's most prominent contribution will always be signing Robinson to break baseball's color barrier:""To me, Rickey and Robinson were the right combination,"" said Lowenfish. ""The years when they were together were vital to the country. Rickey was the indispensable man in that move. He also deserves credit for two other revolutions: the farm system and trying to establish the Continental League, a rival league which didn't succeed but which certainly prompted expansion.""What he was able to achieve was remarkable. Given his humble beginnings and extraordinary achievements, Rickey really was the Horatio Alger story writ large.""Innovative baseball executive who helped break baseball's color barrier by signing Jackie Robinson.Overcame: Widespread resistance to baseball's integration and to many of his innovations.Lesson: Importance of thinking strategically and maintaining focus on long-term goals regardless of opposition.""Ethnic prejudice has no place in sports, and baseball must recognize that truth if it is to maintain stature as a national game.""MORE ABOUT LEADERS:Roy Campanella Was A BattlerEwing Kauffman Applied His Winning Formula To Sales, Education, BaseballVin Scully Prepared To Become Baseball's Master Storyteller

29,TSN,"Accusations of collusion that have dogged the American chicken industry in recent months took a new turn after Tyson Foods (TSN), the country's largest producer, said the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating the allegations and sent the company a subpoena.""We are cooperating with the investigation, which is at an early stage,"" Springdale, Ark.-based Tyson said Monday in its 10-Q filing.""Based upon the limited information we have, we believe the investigation is based upon the allegations"" related to antitrust litigation involving broiler chickens, the company went on to say.Tyson and its largest competitors have been named as defendants in a series of lawsuits that claim the industry colluded starting in 2008 to drive prices higher, allegations denied by Tyson and the other companies.The Georgia Department of Agriculture, which gathered and disseminated the benchmark Georgia Dock prices that are the focus of some of the complaints, discontinued its widely used pricing index in December. Starting this month, the department began collecting data for a new index, although a lack of contributions has delayed the publication of the new measure.Shares of Tyson, which also reported record quarterly earnings, fell 3.8% in New York. Rival producers Sanderson Farms (SAFM) and Pilgrim's Pride (PPC) also dropped, losing 2.4% and 3.8%, respectively.Despite the chicken controversy, Tyson's business is booming. It reported net income of $1.59 a share for the three months through Dec. 31, up from $1.15 a year earlier and beating the $1.27 average of 12 estimates compiled by Bloomberg.""We capitalized on favorable market conditions in our beef and pork segments and the cash generated is providing fuel for growth in our value-added chicken and prepared foods segments,"" Chief Executive Officer Tom Hayes said on a conference call.Earnings excluding one-time items will be $4.90 to $5.05 a share in the 12 months through September, it said in a separate statement. That compares with a December forecast of profit at $4.70 to $4.85.The higher guidance is ""primarily the result of this quarter's far-stronger-than-expected margin performance,"" David Palmer, a New York-based analyst for RBC Capital Markets who has a sector perform rating on the shares, said in a report on Monday. The increase ""suggests some degree of over-earning this quarter relative to the remaining three quarters.""Hayes said the company's goal is for long-term earnings per share growth to be in high single digits as it invests back into its businesses.Tyson has in the past targeted growth above 10%, and in fiscal 2016, its adjusted earnings rose 39%.

31,TSN,"Tyson Foods (TSN) and Sanderson Farms (SAFM) are among the companies being asked by officials in Georgia, the nation's largest producer of chickens, to meet new requirements for a price index as the agency makes changes amid concerns about the reliability of the benchmark.The Georgia Department of Agriculture is asking the companies and their representatives to submit affidavits and attestations declaring the price data they supply for the weekly so-called Georgia Dock index is accurate. The documents are due Tuesday, agency spokeswoman Julie McPeake said Monday. Companies that don't meet the new requirements won't be able to participate in the index.Tyson, the largest U.S. chicken producer, continues to provide pricing data to the department but is considering whether to submit the affidavit, company spokesman Worth Sparkman said by telephone Monday. Sanderson said last week it's also considering signing the affidavit.""We've used it for 40 years and everybody's always had a lot of confidence in it,"" Sanderson Chief Financial Officer Mike Cockrell said of the index in a recent telephone interview. ""I hope they get this right because as I say, we've used it so long.""The changes to Georgia's pricing methodology come amid heightened scrutiny of the index. Tyson and Sanderson are among producers named as defendants in a series of lawsuits filed since September alleging supply collusion in the industry starting in 2008 to drive up prices. The companies deny the allegations.The Georgia Dock price index ""is highly susceptible to collusion,"" according to a revised complaint filed in Chicago federal court. The lawsuit previously mainly alleged supply collusion that led to higher prices.Another source of concern has been criticism of the weekly chicken-price report from Arty Schronce, director of the Georgia Department of Agriculture. Writing in September in an internal memo obtained by Bloomberg News, Schronce complained of inadequate resources and a lack of cooperation from the chicken producers, and said the department should perhaps consider eliminating the report altogether.Tyson didn't immediately respond to requests for comment about Schronce's criticisms of chicken producers while Sanderson declined to comment. Schronce couldn't be reached for comment.Responding to the comments about a lack of resources, McPeake at the Georgia Department of Agriculture said one of Schronce's colleagues died unexpectedly. The agency made ""every effort"" to train him and brought in a retired employee to help Schronce with the transition, she said.McPeake also said there are conflicting reports about how important the index is to the industry, and that it could be terminated if it's determined not to be worthwhile. If the index is needed, the department is working to make sure the gauge is an accurate and informative trend analysis tool, she said.The Georgia Department of Agriculture compiles prices for chicken products such as breasts, leg quarters and whole birds, plus the benchmark Georgia Dock index, which is widely used as the basis of prices paid by wholesalers and retailers. Published on Wednesdays, the index is an average of offering prices for birds weighing 2.5 to 3 pounds (1.1 to 1.4 kilos) as reported by producers. Each company's contribution is weighted based on production capacity.Tyson spokesman Sparkman said the index was only used to price 3% to 4% of Tyson's chicken sales. While Sanderson has confidence in the accuracy of Georgia Dock, the potential disappearance of the index would have a minimal impact on the company, which would simply use another price-discovery mechanism, Cockrell said.Still, the Georgia Dock has been a benchmark used across the country by retailers and other large buyers. Until recently, the U.S. Department of Agriculture used the index in its own poultry-market news report. The USDA said earlier this month it discontinued the report as it worked with the Georgia Department of Agriculture to ""ensure that poultry producers and retailers have access to the transparent and reliable data they need.""The state is working on the new pricing formula with the University of Georgia, the USDA and the Poultry Federation. McPeake said the state agency intends to release details in the near future.Tyson rose 0.1% to $58.40 at 9:34 a.m. in New York. The shares are up 9.4% this year. Sanderson climbed 1.3% to $81.62. It has gained 6.4% in 2016.

47,TSN,"Art instructor and mother of three Amy Frankson has cut back on her trips to Pavilions supermarket from three times a week to maybe three times a month. For the most part, her groceries — including perishables like eggs and milk — are now dropped off at her doorstep in green totes marked ""AmazonFresh.""Her household used to rack up about $300 in weekly supermarket receipts from Pavilions, a Safeway chain. Now Frankson's family spends about $200 a week on groceries, and buys an estimated 85% from the Amazon's fresh-grocery home-delivery service. There's also the convenience factor.""If I order it in the morning, it could be there by dinner time,"" she said from her home in Newport Beach, Calif.Shoppers like Frankson have Wal-Mart (WMT), Kroger (KR) and others scrambling to get ahead of Amazon (AMZN). The e-commerce giant has swallowed up segment after segment of the retail business and spit out bookstores, electronics retailers and clothing chains along the way. Now Amazon hungers to pile groceries onto its plate.And millennials, who are finally starting to form their own households, could accelerate Amazon's push into refrigerators around the world.In fact, even as Amazon rolls out new shows on its streaming video service and new gadgets with artificial intelligence, some analysts believe everyday groceries could deliver the biggest boost to its revenue.Amazon shares have pulled back a bit after hitting new highs earlier this month but were up 0.1% at 744.86 Friday. The stock is up 10% so far for 2016, compared with the S&P 500's 6% year-to-date gain.Wal-Mart rose 3 cents to 73.55 on Friday, and Kroger edged up 0.1%.IBD'S TAKE: Amazon's earnings report next week could propel the stock even higher. Here is how investors could have approached Amazon's earlier run-up and why the lowest stock price isn't always the best.For now, Amazon controls an estimated 1.1% of the $795 billion food and beverage business through various Prime offerings, including Pantry and its fresh-grocery delivery service, Fresh. Wal-Mart, including Sam's Club, leads with 21%, according to a March analysis from Cowen analysts John Blackledge and Oliver Chen. Kroger's 9% market share puts it at a distant second, and Albertson's/Safeway, Costco (COST) and Publix round out the top five with low- to mid-single-digit shares apiece.But when it comes to online grocery sales, Amazon is already No. 1, bagging a 22% share in 2015 vs. Wal-Mart's 13%.First tested in Seattle almost a decade ago, AmazonFresh has quietly popped up since then in about a dozen cities along the coasts. They include Los Angeles, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Baltimore and New York.A new offensive has brought Fresh back into public focus. The service recently launched in Boston and across the pond in London.An Amazon spokesperson said the company does not comment on its product roadmap.""We're branching out as fast as we can while being careful not to sacrifice the quality and convenience our customers expect from AmazonFresh,"" says Amazon's help page.To shop on AmazonFresh, customers have to sign up for Prime Fresh, a higher-tier Prime membership that costs $299 annually. At $200 more than a regular Prime subscription, the service isn't exactly cheap, but Frankson said it ""definitely pays for itself.""Gen Xers like Frankson and her husband, Brian Mackerer, both 42, are contributing to growing online-grocery penetration. According to a recent Cowen analysis, 16% of surveyed 35- to 44-year-olds used such a service in February. As for millennials, the firm found that 21% of 25- to 34-year-olds had bought groceries online, with 28% pegged as ""likely future buyers.""""Particularly with a younger generation, there's no desire to drive to a store and push a cart down an aisle and load heavy items and stand in line at checkout and then throw stuff in your trunk or in bags on the bus or whatever and take it home, when there are other more convenient options,"" Baird analyst Colin Sebastian told IBD.Fellow tech titan Alphabet, meanwhile, has taken a different route with its Google Express service, positioning itself as a courier between residents and nearby stores like Target (TGT), Ulta Beauty (ULTA) and Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA), rather than a direct competitor.Google Express memberships cost $95 a year or $10 a month; nonmembers are charged $4.99 per delivery. It's available in a sprinkling of cities across the country. Cold grocery delivery is only featured in parts of Los Angeles and San Francisco.Perhaps mercifully for legacy players with established supplier relationships and infrastructure, the complex fulfillment strategy associated with fresh food is slowing down Amazon's grocery takeover.Handling produce and perishables is a whole different animal at an Amazon fulfillment center. There are temperature checks, quality requirements and inspections, according to an MIT report cited in Cowen's analysis. Plus, just like at the supermarket, bags have to be packed with extra care to ensure that berries are not smashed and eggs aren't cracked.Why bother with a low-margin business that has difficult logistics?Because people go grocery shopping about four to five times a month, and the added operating income dollars outweigh the unattractive margins, say Blackledge and Chen. Plus, it lures shoppers into Amazon's Prime ecosystem.""For (Amazon), we think the purchase frequency fits well with the Prime value proposition and the incremental operating-income (dollars) offset the low-margin profile,"" they wrote, adding that Amazon will benefit from scale and logistics expertise, among other things.That should translate to billions more dollars at the top line. The Cowen analysts estimate the U.S. food and drink market is Amazon's ""biggest category for upside impact to revenue and/or"" gross merchandise volume. They see the company's grocery volume shooting up to $23.2 billion five years from now from an estimated $8.7 billion this year.Of the additional spending that goes to online food and beverage sales in the U.S. from 2016 to 2021, Blackledge and Chen think Amazon alone will capture 38% -- and that's a conservative forecast.Longtime food suppliers to grocery stores are expected to hop on board the Amazon train as shopping habits shift, margins be damned.""At this point, a lot of suppliers realize Amazon is absolutely a must — a channel they have to be on, even if it comes at the expense of their margins,"" said Morningstar analyst R.J. Hottovy. ""The amount of velocity and product sales you're going to get through Amazon, you absolutely have to be a partner in some way.""When it comes to online grocery shopping, traditional grocery bigwigs are throwing everything to the wall to see what sticks, including partnerships with last-mile delivery services like Instacart or features such as in-store pickup.""It's very clear that all of those players are looking for a solution,"" said Piper Jaffray analyst Sean Naughton. But which solution works best is still a mystery.Target (TGT) has been testing online grocery delivery in Minneapolis. Kroger shoppers can use ClickList to order online and pick up in a store, or Vitacost.com to order health foods and vitamins for home delivery. Wal-Mart offers curbside delivery pickup in dozens of markets, and has plans to expand.Of the major players, market leader Wal-Mart ""appears to be the farthest along with future-proofing, in our view, with online grocery pickup up in 20 markets now and adding an additional 22 this year,"" according to the Cowen report. It noted that Wal-Mart sees online grocery pickup as a ""key growth strategy"" for its U.S. stores and online business in fiscal 2017 and beyond.At a Deutsche Bank consumer conference in mid-June, Wal-Mart CFO Brett Biggs sounded bullish on the company's online grocery prospects, while noting that its shoppers may in fact prefer in-store pickup over home delivery.""(Customers) like — while they're out — being able to come pick up their groceries,"" he said. ""So it's an area that will evolve a lot. We think we have a good competitive position where we're at, and I think it'll be a big part of our future.""Costco, on the other hand, doesn't care for the ""order online, pick up in store"" model. Instacart and Google Express enable home delivery of certain perishables and other items, but Costco mostly wants customers to pay its warehouses a visit.""We don't want somebody to come by necessarily and pick it up,"" said CFO Richard Galanti during the company's Q2 earnings call in March. ""Maybe that would change if we were having minus-3% comps in our lives. So we want to do everything possible to get them in the store and not just come and pick something up. So I don't see that as being a strategic focus of ours, at least in the near term.""Whole Foods Market (WFM) has taken its relationship with Instacart up a notch. The specialty grocer announced in March that it would roll out in several new markets over the next year, in addition to the 17 metro areas that it already serves.But for Whole Foods, Trader Joe's, Sprouts Farmers Market (SFM) and the like, AmazonFresh isn't the only worry.Meal-kit services like Blue Apron and HelloFresh, which deliver pre-measured ingredients along with a recipe, are a ""fast-growing market"" and an ""incremental headwind"" to the specialty grocery space, according to Naughton. He said 25% of people who say they shop primarily at specialty grocery stores have tried home-delivery meal kits.Indeed, Frankson said Blue Apron is ""eroding"" what is left of her family's need for Pavilions. She has also tried snack subscription box Graze, but said she was ""not crazy about all the snacks and they just piled up.""Amazon has its nose in that, too. Tyson Foods (TSN) will debut a meal-kit delivery service, Tyson Taste Makers, in partnership with AmazonFresh later this year.But for some people — and some foods — the in-store experience will continue to be essential.A Nielsen global study found that 61% of poll respondents think going to a supermarket is ""enjoyable and engaging,"" and 57% believe the act of grocery shopping is ""a fun day out for the family.""Plus, people get picky about their produce.""There's still an element of consumers wanting to touch and feel what they're buying,"" said Hottovy. ""I think that's still the biggest hurdle for them in becoming a major disruptive player.""Frankson, however, is ""very happy"" with AmazonFresh's produce.""They don't give me dodgy-looking avocados,"" she said.

62,TSN,"Fast growth hasn’t vanished.Despite this uptrend’s defensive tilt, a handful of stocks in the Big Cap 20 show strong fundamentals.Cloud player and software provider Adobe Systems (ADBE) is on a roll. In the past five quarters, earnings jumped 47%, 30%, 93%, 59% and 50%. Revenue grew 11%, 9%, 21%, 22% and 25% in the same quarters.How many big-cap stocks can claim that kind of earnings and revenue growth? Not many. Toss in a factor to weed out thin stocks, and only one other big cap pops up: Salesforce.com (CRM), which last appeared in the Big Cap 20 on Dec. 29.The Street expects Adobe to stay in the fast lane in fiscal 2016, which ends in November. Earnings are expected to grow 37% this year and 33% in fiscal 2017.Pretax margin was 27.8% last year, but return on equity was only 15%. Research shows that history’s greatest stocks carried an ROE of at least 17%.Adobe sketched a cup-with-handle base and broke out March 17. Volume was 73% above average. The buy point was 88.65. The stock is about 7% extended from the entry.However, the left-side high could provide another buy point -- this one at 96.52, unless a handle forms.The weekly base shows plenty of accumulation. Funds adding to their position in Q4 include Fidelity Contrafund (FCNTX), which increased its stake by almost 19% in the fourth quarter.Meanwhile, business software provider Intuit (INTU) is in the midst of a turnaround and shakeup.Earnings in fiscal Q1, which ended in October, rose to nine cents a share vs. a loss of 11 cents a share in the year-earlier period. Then in fiscal Q2, which ended in January, Intuit booked a profit of 25 cents a share vs. a year-earlier loss of six cents a share.Revenue stepped up from 7% to 17% to 23% in recent quarters.The Street expects earnings to advance 34% in fiscal 2016, which ends in July. Revenue is seen rising 9%.The company’s products include TurboTax. In recent weeks, Intuit reached agreements to sell its online application software QuickBase, personal finance software Quicken and marketing software Demandforce.Intuit bought back $455 million’s worth of shares in fiscal Q2.Shares dived sharply in August when the plan to divest non-core segments was first announced. Since then, the stock has rebounded and built a base within the larger consolidation. Intuit is climbing the right side and is 3% off the 108 high of the pattern.Tyson Foods (TSN) might sound defensive, but the meat provider grew earnings 49% in fiscal Q1, which ended in December. For fiscal 2016, earnings are expected to advance 25%. The stock is in a profit-taking zone from a February breakout.In most cases, a stock should be sold after it reaches a 20% to 25% profit. Most stocks will begin to consolidate after such a gain.Image provided by Shutterstock.

63,TSN,"Cal-Maine (CALM) topped third-quarter profit expectations by 34 cents Monday morning, sending shares up sharply.Earnings popped 27% to $1.33 per share on 3% revenue growth to $449.8 million, well above analyst forecasts for 99 cents a share and $463.6 million in revenue. Sales were primarily driven by higher average selling prices.The country's largest shell egg producer, Cal-Maine makes specialty brands Egg-Land's Best, Land O' Lakes, Farmhouse and 4-Grain.The industry's supply was hit by avian influenza last year, though it is ""steadily"" recovering, said the company.""Industrywide, retail demand trends for shell eggs have been favorable in spite of the supply disruptions; however, egg prices have been negatively affected by increased egg supplies due to demand erosion for egg products, increased egg imports and reduced egg exports,"" said CEO Dolph Baker in a statement.""Egg inventories have continued to build, and we expect market prices will remain volatile until the industry has more clarity on future supply levels.""As consumers demand more natural food options such as cage-free eggs, Cal-Maine's specialty egg volume grew 13.7% from the prior-year Q3.Shares closed up 8.8%, climbing back above their 200-day average. Shares of grocery shelf peers Tyson Foods (TSN) and Hormel (HRL) rose 0.9% and 1.2%, respectively.RELATED:Protein For The Facebook Generation: They Want It Convenient And Clean.Image provided by Shutterstock.

64,TSN,"Eighty-year old companies that specialize in meat production aren’t usually looked upon as growth stocks, but Tyson Foods (TSN) aims to position itself as one anyway.The world’s largest processor and marketer of chicken, beef and pork plans to do so by putting more focus on branded products rather than commodities such as fresh poultry.Its ultimate goal? To become the ""leading branded protein company in the world,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst David Palmer noted in a recent report.""Tyson continues to position itself as a growth company with advantaged brands within advantaged categories,"" Palmer said.Those categories include high-margin, ""value-added"" products such as marinated and breaded poultry; prepared foods, including what it calls its “Core 9” packaged brands like Jimmy Dean sausage and Hillshire Farms lunch meat; and antibiotic and gluten-free chicken.During the recent Consumer Analyst Group of New York conference in Boca Raton, Fla., Tyson officials said 85% of the company’s chicken business consists of poultry that is more than just raw meat.""This further differentiates (Tyson) from its more commodity-oriented peers,"" Palmer noted.Tyson Chief Executive Donald Smith echoed that point on a fiscal first-quarter conference call with analysts.""I believe we've demonstrated separation from the commodity players in large part due to the disproportionately high mix of value-added products in our portfolio as well as the production flexibility created with our buy vs. grow strategy, which also reduces commodity exposure,"" Smith said. The ""buy vs. grow"" strategy refers to Tyson’s decision to purchase some of its chickens from other facilities and reduce the number of chickens it grows itself.Tyson officials have made no secret of their desire to change the way investors view the company. As JPMorgan analyst Ken Goldman pointed out in a recent note, the first two words of Tyson’s presentation at the consumer group event were ""different company.""""Tyson remains firmly (and understandably) committed to convincing investors that it is a different company than it used to be,"" Goldman noted. ""The primary reason for the difference continues to be Tyson’s emphasis -- both in reality and perception -- on branded food rather than commodity protein.""One difference between branded food and commodity meat items is that the former carries higher prices and margins, Goldman says. Tyson’s Core 9 brands carry ""an 11% average premium over the category average.""Tyson also spent a lot of time talking about revenue growth during the consumer group event. That stood in contrast to other food companies, such as General Mills (GIS) and Nabisco parent Mondelez International (MDLZ), which mainly focused on cost-cutting.""These companies spent much, maybe most, of their time today talking about costs, whereas the opposite was true for Tyson,"" Goldman noted. ""It helps to have a category (meat/protein) growing at a better-than-average pace, as well as a category that responds well to mix- and margin-accretive innovation today.""There appears to be plenty of demand for Tyson’s meat products. Palmer cited Tyson research showing that 54% of U.S. consumers want to increase the amount of protein in their diets.Worldwide, long-term demand for protein is expected to increase more than 60% from current levels due to population growth and the emergence of a global middle class that can afford to buy more meat products.Favorable industry trends, combined with investor optimism over the food sector in general, have helped push Tyson’s stock price up more than 40% since Nov. 20. Its shares set a record high of 64.63 on Feb. 23 — the sixth straight session they reached a new high.Other large-cap food companies that have set new highs this month include Sysco (SYY), Campbell Soup (CPB) and J.M. Smucker (SJM).One reason for the recent stock gains is the defensive nature of the food business. When stock markets are volatile, many investors flock to consumer staples such as food. Companies in this industry aren’t as vulnerable to wide swings in performance and value and also tend to pay regular dividends. Some food companies also have benefited from cheap gas prices, which lower transportation costs.Meanwhile, Tyson has gotten a lift from falling food costs. Excessive supplies of cattle feed such as corn and soybeans have lowered production prices of beef, poultry and pork. Lower costs were one reason Tyson raised its full-year earnings forecast earlier this month to a range of $3.85 to $3.95 a share from prior guidance of $3.50 to $3.65.The company also recently reiterated its goal of 10%-or-better annual earnings-per-share growth in coming years, and suggested that its long-term margin goals might be conservative.“We would not be surprised if before the fiscal year ended, Tyson raised its long-term chicken margin to maybe 8% to 10% from 7% to 9% currently,” Goldman noted.Tyson posted earnings of $1.15 a share for its fiscal first quarter, which ended in December. That was up 49% from the previous year and well above consensus analyst estimates for 89 cents. It was the biggest quarterly EPS gain in nearly two years.On the downside, revenue declined 15% to $9.15 billion -- the first dip since the September 2012 quarter -- partly because of the divestiture of a few noncore businesses. The top-line result fell short of consensus for $10 billion.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Tyson’s full-year earnings to climb 27% this fiscal year and another 7% in fiscal 2017.

70,TSN,"Shares of Tyson Foods (TSN) continued to rally Monday, hitting a new high in heavy trading.The stock started surging Friday, when the maker of Jimmy Dean, Ball Park and other meat products posted earnings for the December-ended quarter that beat expectations. Management also raised its outlook.Adjusted earnings jumped 49% to $1.15 a share. But sales fell 15% to $9.15 billion, below the consensus estimate of $10.07 billion. Compared with the year-ago quarter, the average price of beef is down 14.4%, chicken 4.7% and pork 19.5%.Still, the company said it is operating at record operating margins.Tyson raised its profit forecast for the current fiscal year ending this September to $3.85 to $3.95 a share, up from $3.15 in 2015 and above analyst estimates for $3.63. It estimated sales of $37 billion, down from its previous estimate of $41 billion, citing lower prices on the horizon.Prices of beef, chicken, pork and turkey are expected to drop 2% to 3% from the previous fiscal year because of higher domestic production and moderate export growth.Benefits from the 2014 acquisition of Hillshire Farms are still being worked in. The company sees ""synergies of more than $500 million in fiscal 2016 and more than $700 million in fiscal 2017 from the acquisition,"" plus benefits from its prepared foods business.Tyson shares are now extended from the 54.52 buy point. But with the market in a correction, Tyson's outperformance makes it one to watch when the market gets back up. Look for a secondary entry to develop once market conditions are more amenable.Tyson, which said it has made $750 million in share buybacks, has expanded its current buyback plan by 50 million shares.

71,TSN,"Tyson Foods' (TSN) quarterly profit far outpaced estimates, with the company also raising its full-year earnings estimate, driving its stock to a new all-time high.The parent of Jimmy Dean, Hillshire Farm, Ball Park, State Fair and Aidells brands said fiscal-first-quarter earnings per share minus one-time items shot up 49% to $1.15, beating analysts' forecasts by 26 cents a share.It's the third quarter in a row that the company has beaten Wall Street projections. The meat producer posted record margins for both its Chicken and Prepared Foods segments in Q1.Tyson raised it full-year profit forecast to $3.85 to $3.95 per share, up from $3.15 in 2015 and well above analyst estimates for $3.63.However, revenue fell 15.4% to $9.15 billion, while consensus was for $10.07 billion.President and CEO Donnie Smith said in a written statement, “Our ongoing efforts to invest in and grow our Core 9 product lines are paying off, as sales volume for the most recent four-week period was up 4%."" The company defines its Core 9 as its strongest brands with the highest growth opportunities.Tyson Foods shares gapped up by as much as 13% Friday morning before closing up 9.9% at 57.10 on the stock market today. The stock rose above a month-long flat base and is now above a 54.52 buy point.The Springdale, Ark.-based company forecast that U.S. chicken, beef, pork and turkey industry production will increase 2% to 3% from 2015, and there will be moderate export growth. Increased supply could pressure meat prices this year, Tyson said.As a result, it forecast its total sales this fiscal year will be about $37 billion, down from its previous estimate of $41 billion, due to the declines in prices. The revised guidance is below the consensus of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters for $39.83 billion.The Food-Meat Products group is ranked a near-best 6 on IBD's list of 197 industries.Among other large companies in the group, Hormel Foods (HRL), which will announce fiscal Q1 results Feb. 16, rose 0.65%. Pilgrims Pride (PPC), which will release Q4 earnings Thursday, dipped 0.2%. Cal-Maine Foods (CALM), which reported lower-than-expected revenue and EPS in December, fell 3.85%.Sanderson Farms (SAFM), which is slated to report earnings Feb. 25, climbed 1.8%.

72,TSN,"Meat producer Tyson Foods (TSN) and food wholesaler Sysco (SYY) set record highs Friday as both stocks continue to benefit from favorable industry trends as well as the relative safety of the food segment in an otherwise rocky market.Tyson shares rose just a penny but still set a fresh closing high of 62.97 on the stock market today. It was the fourth straight session in which the supplier of beef, pork, chicken and other products established a new record.Sysco, which distributes food to restaurants, hospitals, schools and other customers, closed up 1.1% to a new high of 44.99 Friday. It was the fifth straight record session for Sysco.Tyson and Sysco join Campbell Soup (CPB) and J.M. Smucker (SJM) among large-cap food stocks that have set new highs this month.The entire sector has gotten a lift from the defensive nature of the food business, analysts say. When stock markets are volatile, many investors flock to consumer staples such as food, which are less susceptible to wide fluctuations and also tend to pay regular dividends.Food companies also have benefited from cheap gas prices, which lower transportation costs. This is especially important to companies like Sysco that move a lot of product from one place to another.Meanwhile, companies such as Tyson have gotten a lift from falling food costs. A large supply of cattle feed such as corn and soybeans has lowered production prices of beef, poultry and pork -- a big reason Tyson raised its full-year earnings forecast earlier this month.IBD’s Wholesale-Foods group ranks at No. 3 out of 197 industry groups tracked. Food-Meat Products ranks at No. 4, while the Food-Packaged group ranks at No. 9.

73,TSN,"It’s a simple fact of life: Larger conveyances offer smoother rides, be they cars, horses, ships, motorcycles or aircraft.The same tends to hold true for stocks. Hefty market capitalizations, big floats and deep-pocketed shareholders tend to provide shock absorbers for a stock during tumultuous markets.This is one of the driving reasons for IBD’s Big Cap 20 list.The feature appears every Tuesday in IBD and can be found daily under Investors.com’s Stock Lists menu.Stocks on the list must have market capitalizations of at least $15 billion. They must also pass muster with regard to EPS and Relative Strength ratings, the Sales + Margins + Return On Equity Rating, and other factors related to their chart status and balance sheet.Most Big Cap 20 names are ""low beta"" stocks. This means they tend to swing less than the S&P 500 on a day-to-day basis. At the top of the current Big Cap 20 list (see Feb. 23 edition), the IBD Stock Quote for Verizon (VZ) shows a Beta of 0.73. That marks it 27% less volatile than the overall market.In short, Verizon is not likely to become a hyperactive growth stock. But it still may produce solid gains during periods when the market struggles, and it is less likely to shake shareholders out with volatile action. Take this year, for instance: When the S&P 500 ended Wednesday down 4.6% for the year, Verizon showed a 9.9% gain.Here's one added perk: Many Big Cap 20 stocks also offer dividends. In Verizon’s case, the current dividend yields an annualized 4.5%.Not all Big Cap 20 stocks have low betas. No. 2 on the current list, Nvidia (NVDA), shows a beta of 1.19. It's definitely more volatile.But further down the list you’ll find AT&T (T) with a beta of 0.67, Tyson Foods (TSN) with a 0.66 beta and WEC Energy Group (WEC) with a beta of 0.56. These three big-cap stocks are up 8%, 23% and 10%, respectively, and offer dividend yields of 5.1%, 0.9% and 3.1% this year.And that’s just a quick scan through the first eight stocks on the list.Remember, you don’t just jump into any stock on the list. As with any leading stock, big-cap leaders must be passing valid buy points in strong volume, and the market must be in an uptrend. Be more cautious if you see IBD's Big Picture column noting that the uptrend is under pressure.
"
74,TSN,"When it comes to mature markets, it doesn’t get much more mature than breakfast cereal, which was first introduced in the U.S. during the Civil War.That kind of mileage makes it difficult for leading cereal makers such as Post Holdings (POST) -- which traces its history to 1895 -- to find growth through the kinds of disruptive, gee-whiz advances you’ll find in other sectors of the economy. There’s only so many flavors you can pull out of cereal grains after more than a century of trying, and only so many ways to package and market them.So Post has looked for growth via acquisitions into different product lines. Since being spun off by Ralcorp in February 2012, the company has made nine buyouts. You can expect Post to keep scouting deals in coming months.“We believe we are quite well positioned with the considerable amount of cash on hand approaching $900 million,” Chief Financial Officer Jeff Zadoks said on the company's recent fiscal-first-quarter conference call with analysts. “We’ve got considerable secured debt capacity (and) a very rich pipeline of opportunities. I think we are going to have plenty of opportunities on the M&A front.”Acquisitions have helped Post grow its top line nearly 400% over the last four years — from $959 million in annual revenue in 2012 to $4.6 billion last year.Some have helped Post expand its traditional lineup of cereal brands. But the company also has moved into other product areas like pasta, protein bars, dried fruits, nuts, eggs, sports nutrition supplements and peanut butter. Among the company’s acquired brands: PowerBar, Attune Foods, Dakota Growers Pasta, American Blanching and Mom Brands.Post’s latest buyout came in October, when it spent $90 million to acquire Willamette Egg Farms, a producer, processor and wholesale distributor of eggs and egg products in the Northwest. The Willamette business is expected to add $80 million a year in net sales to Post and around $15 million a year in earnings before various adjustments, or EBITDA.Several different businesses fall under the Post corporate umbrella. The Post Foods business includes ready-to-eat cereal brands such as Grape Nuts, Post Raisin Bran and Pebbles. Mom Brands is geared more toward hot and value-priced cereals.Brands in the Michael Foods Group include Simply Potatoes hash browns, Dakota Growers pasta and All Whites liquid egg whites. The Active Nutrition segment features the PowerBar, Premier Nutrition and Dymatize Nutrition brands. Post also has a Private Brands group that includes Golden Boy peanut butter and nuts, as well as Attune Foods, which is heavy on organic and non-GMO granolas, cereals and snacks.Michael Foods is the biggest segment by sales, accounting for just less than half of the total. Post Foods contributes about one-third of sales, with the rest fairly evenly split between Active Nutrition and Private Brands. All of the segments saw declines in comparable sales during the first quarter.Post had a mixed performance during the quarter, which ended in December. The company logged adjusted earnings of 52 cents a share. That reversed a loss of $1.15 per share from the previous year and came in well above consensus estimates for 25 cents.But sales, which grew 16% to $1.25 billion, came in slightly below views. The gain was driven by Mom Brands, which Post acquired last year for about $1 billion. On a comparable basis that excludes the contribution of acquired brands, Post’s net sales declined 4.2% from the prior year.Still, the company’s share price hit a record high of 72.64 on March 3. The stock has also been helped by volatility in the broader market, which tends to push investors to the relative safety of the food business. In addition to Post, other food stocks that have set new highs in recent weeks include Tyson Foods (TSN), Sysco (SYY), Campbell Soup (CPB) and J.M. Smucker (SJM).“Underlying sales were negatively affected by the volume declines in the egg business, as well as the company’s transition in its Dymatize business to an outsourced production model following the closure of its manufacturing facility in the quarter,” Stifel analyst Christopher Growe noted in a first-quarter earnings report.On the upside, Post’s EBITDA for the quarter came in at $236 million, ahead of estimates. Post also raised its fiscal 2016 EBITDA guidance to a range of $810 million to $840 million from prior guidance of $780 million to $820 million.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Post to log full-year earnings of $1.61 a share, up from 62 cents in fiscal 2015. Earnings are seen rising another 30% to $2.09 in fiscal 2017.“The company noted that this new guidance range incorporates incremental investments (approximately $25 million) related to incremental marketing spending and achieving synergies from the Mom Brands acquisition,” Growe said.During the first-quarter conference call, Chief Executive Robert Vitale mentioned a couple of macro trends that work in his company’s favor. One is low energy prices tied to cheap oil, which helps keep manufacturing costs down.Another is the company’s low exposure to volatile international markets. Post gets less than 10% of its sales from outside the U.S., and most of that comes from Canada.“While this domestic profile is a challenge in delivering volume growth, it also provides a safe haven from recent currency headwinds,” Vitale said.

89,TSN,"The meat products industry group has emerged as the No. 1 group out of 197, as of Thursday's IBD. The rise could be partly defensive, with money managers shifting to companies showing steady growth in the belief they will hold up better than high fliers as the market turns lower.But companies in the group have seen have seen solid earnings and sales growth in recent quarters. Five of the nine stocks in the group have Composite Ratings of 90 or above.Supply and demand have driven the story in several of these stocks. Commodity prices have been falling, making feed cheaper. Cattle herds are growing after several years of declines. One factor is the years of Western drought, which forced cattle ranchers to reduce herds but now may be coming to an end as El Nino brings rains.The No. 2 stock in the group by Composite Rating is Hormel (HRL), the maker of Spam, Jennie-O Turkey, Skippy peanut butter, Black Label Bacon and Muscle Milk. The company noted in recent presentations and in its most recent earnings report that its grocery products and refrigerated foods products business were benefiting from input-cost deflation.Growth in China has also been a factor.Tyson Foods (TSN), the nation's largest meat packer by sales, forecast another year of record profits in its Nov. 23 earnings report.""Our chicken business is strong, pork continues to do well, and we think the worst is behind us in beef,"" Chief Executive Donnie Smith said in a conference call.Chicken producers have weathered an outbreak of avian flu that forced the destruction of large flocks.Hormel reported sales declines of its Jennie-O turkey because of bird flu, but it said the product has become the ""clear category leader"" and is being embraced by health-conscious millennials.While that hurt some producers, it helped Cal-Maine Foods (CALM), the nation's largest egg producer and top-ranked in the meat products industry group, which was unscathed in the disease outbreak.It benefited as the price of eggs soared. Over the last two quarters, year-over-year earnings growth was triple-digit, while sales grew at 71% and 44% clips. After-tax margins were north of 40%. But analysts see the good times coming to an eventual end. They forecast a 31% EPS decline in fiscal 2017.Cal-Maine's stock has given up ground in recent weeks and is now trading below its 200-day moving average.Acquisitions have also been a factor in the industry group. Tyson recently bought Hillshire Brands, which has given it a bigger footprint in the packaged food business.Hormel Foods last year paid $775 million to buy organic processed meats maker Applegate Farms. Hormel says it's the No. 1 organic and natural producer by market share in value-added proteins.

91,TSN,"Temple Grandin had trouble relating to people. But she sure could relate to animals. By dealing with her autism, she developed a unique understanding of creatures to build humane facilities for farms and slaughterhouses.Grandin has built many animal handling facilities for slaughterhouses, feed yards and ranches in the U.S., Canada and Europe.She has also created animal welfare guidelines for the meat industry, advised McDonald's (MCD), Tyson Foods (TSN) and other firms on animal welfare, written articles for a maze of publications and become a professor of livestock behavior at Colorado State University.Now 68, she's aiming to help give children the same social awareness that her life has imbedded in her.Grandin's autism helped her decode animals' behavior and understand why they think the way they do, says Teresa Corey, a conference director for Future Horizons, a group based in Arlington, Texas, that hosts conferences and publishes information on autism and Asperger's syndrome.Autism and Asperger's are developmental disabilities that cause people difficulties with social interaction and communication. Signs are typically first noticed during a child's first two years.Good Feeling""Temple would watch how cows became calm in the squeeze chute as they went in for vaccines,"" said Corey. ""With her autism, she didn't like to be touched, and marveled at how cows would be calmed down with a squeeze and built her own squeezing machine.""Grandin has become so successful in improving handling facilities and speaking on autism, HBO made a movie of her life starring Claire Danes in 2010.Early life wasn't easy for Grandin. Born in Boston in 1947, she displayed classic symptoms of autism, such as the inability to speak and an aversion to physical contact.Doctors at Boston Children's Hospital labeled her brain damaged. The diagnosis of autism was still new, having been recognized just a few years before her birth.Autism now affects 1 in 68 American children and is one of the fastest-growing developmental disorders in the country, according to Autism Speaks, a nonprofit science and advocacy organization.Grandin's mother, Eustacia Cutler, sent her to a speech therapy school and hired a nanny; they teamed up to give her a traditional upbringing. They taught her table manners, how to interact with her mother's guests and not to spend much time in front of the TV.""You have to stretch (mentally to overcome autism),"" Grandin told IBD. ""My mother knew how to stretch me when I was a young child. She knew how to get me partly outside my comfort zone.""Grandin had trouble with speech and making friends, and didn't like going into crowded rooms. But her mother made her socialize with people at parties and work outside the home. The push paid off, with Grandin now speaking in front of thousands of people about autism awareness and animal science.Still, Grandin says, her adolescence and high school days were rough. Students picked on her, and she moved to Hampshire Country School in Rindge, N.H. The boarding school took gifted students with behavioral issues.The vibe was positive, with Temple working in a horse barn and gaining a strong work ethic.""A problem I'm seeing today are kids getting coddled too much and aren't learning how to work,"" she said. ""I'm seeing kids graduating from high school without ever having a job, and for kids that are quirky or different, that is causing big, big problems.""Grandin credits her old-school upbringing and exposure to work as part of her path upward.She grew interested in cattle and animals when she met them at her aunt's ranch in Arizona and credits her aunt as a crucial mentor.Grandin also lauds a high school science teacher for motivating her to study with hands-on projects.She liked such classes, which went beyond textbooks, and encourages that style of learning: ""My ability in art was always encouraged, and that became the basis of my career in industrial design.""Grandin turned her love of animals, science and art into a career, riding education to the hilt. She received a bachelor's degree in psychology from Franklin Pierce College (now University) in New Hampshire, then landed a master's in animal science at Arizona State University and a Ph.D. in that subject from the University of Illinois.Grandin took what she learned in school and her grasp of what causes animals stress, and went to work designing more humane facilities across the world. She points to hard work over a sustained period as the top key to her advancement.Meanwhile, she leapt at opportunities — such as when she built a better dip vat in Arizona for John Wayne's Red River feed yard in the 1970s on orders from the Agriculture Department after an outbreak of scabies, a contagious skin disease caused by mites, among cattle.""Lucky breaks gave me a lot of jobs,"" she said, ""but I still had to do work after that.""International ReachEquipment that Grandin designed handles 50% of all cattle in the U.S. and Canada.Her 2005 book, ""Animals in Translation: Using the Mysteries of Autism to Decode Animal Behavior,"" was a New York Times best-seller; several hundred industry publications printed excerpts.Corey says that Grandin solved problems by exploring and refusing to deliver pat answers for her professors in college.As for entering the rancher workforce, autism made it especially hard. It helped that an engineer, Jim Uhl of Agate Construction in Scottsdale, Ariz., explained how to get along with co-workers.""There are a lot of talented people out there, and bosses need to learn how to work with them,"" Grandin said of hiring people with special needs. ""Being blunt helps; don't be subtle. And work with a clear goal; don't be vague.""Despite rising in industrial design, Grandin had her setbacks.In the 1980s, the Kahn slaughterhouse and meatpacking plant in Cincinnati hired her to build a conveyer belt to transport pigs too sick or weak to walk up to the third story to be slaughtered.The problem with her design: The belt just pushed the pigs on their backs and was ineffective.""What I learned from that project is that I treated the symptom, not the root cause,"" she said.After collecting the ID tags of the sick pigs, she found they all came from the same farm. The slaughterhouse could have saved money by buying the farm new boars to produce healthier offspring that could walk to the top of the facility instead of paying for the conveyer belt.Down, Not OutGrandin says that she went into a six-month depression after the project failure, but she learned that not everything could be solved by ""throwing engineering at things.""Just as engineering didn't magically solve the problem at the slaughterhouse, Grandin thinks some people expect quick fixes to complicated problems.""Too many times, people look for a magic fix like putting iPads in schools,"" she said, ""but that's not going to fix everything.""She stresses the need for good management in business and good teachers in schools, especially to inspire those who need extra guidance to realize their abilities.""I'm worried that today, too many kids are being labeled as dyslexic, with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and autistic, and they are becoming those labels,"" Grandin said. ""Some of those talented people whom we need to fix the problems of tomorrow are getting that handicapped mentality.""She points to Nikola Tesla, the great inventor of a century ago. If he had stayed out of futuristic findings because of his autism, the world would've been slow to develop alternating current generators.For someone who had trouble socializing in high school, she sure has no problem finding pals in the animal science and autism communities. ""She has friends from ranchers in Montana to Claire Danes in Los Angeles to the students she works with to people in the autism field,"" said Corey. ""She takes people for who they are, and social status doesn't even enter into the picture.""Corey likes Grandin's approach and marvels at how they haven't had a disagreement in their long friendship. ""Empathy goes a lot further than sympathy,"" Corey said of Grandin's ability to interact with others who have autism or parents with autistic children.Grandin says that she lives by this philosophy: Stop looking for all sorts of complicated meanings in life, and just focus on things you can do to improve the world.One way she does it is using the money she's earned from speaking engagements to support autistic students in reaching their full potential.

409,TSN,"Tyson Foods (TSN) is slated to disclose fiscal second-quarter earnings early Monday, and investors will be looking to see if the company can post a fourth straight quarter of double-digit earnings growth.The meat, poultry, pork and prepared-foods company is projected to record a 5% increase in revenue to $8.84 billion.Consensus of 10 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters is for earnings per share to leap 75% to 63 cents.Tyson's strong results over the past year have come despite challenges, including fresh outbreaks of bird and hog viruses in China and elsewhere.Not everyone is convinced Tyson can stay on the fast-growth track. BMO Capital Markets on Tuesday downgraded its rating from outperform (buy) to market perform (neutral). The bank cited what it considers Tyson's high valuation. Tyson stock has risen about 56% from a low of 27.33 on Nov. 4.On the company's first-quarter earnings call in late January, CEO Donnie Smith cautioned that Tyson faces headwinds this year.Smith told analysts that although consumers are becoming less defensive in spending, ""I don't know of anyone who thinks that consumers will go back to their pre-2008 spending habits any time soon.""Investors will look for clues on current pricing trends in the company's earnings report.""Record high beef prices should continue through 2014,"" offsetting lower consumption, Smith said earlier this year. ""Pork prices will also remain high due to lower supply. Chicken should continue to be the winner.""Allianz Global Investors analyst Bryan Agbabian said in a report Wednesday that Tyson is a solid play on the increase in demand for chickens in the U.S. and globally, especially in China, the world's largest consumer market.""Tyson is developing an in-country, in-China integrated production of chicken so that Tyson can then sell to not only the local market there, but also to the U.S.-based restaurants that are doing business there such as (Yum Brands (YUM)-owned) Kentucky Fried Chicken and McDonald's (MCD),"" Agbabian said in the report.Tyson shares were up nearly 1% in Friday afternoon trading in the stock market. Its stock price hit an all-time high 44.01 on March 31 and has consolidated since in sync with a market correction.Among other large meat producers, highly rated Hormel Foods (HRL) was unchanged. Hormel sports a 92 IBD Composite Rating, which means it has outperformed 92% of all stocks on key metrics such as sales and profit growth in recent quarters.Fresh and frozen chicken products-maker Sanderson Farms (SAFM) climbed more than 2%.

425,TSN,"JBS, the biggest meat producer, made an unsolicited $5.6 billion bid for Hillshire Brands — $6.4 billion including assumed debt — seeking to expand its sausage lineup and derail the company's acquisition of Pinnacle Foods.
"
426,TSN,"JBS' Pilgrim's Pride (PPC) offered 45 a share. The deal is contingent on Hillshire (HSH) scrapping its $4.8 billion agreement to acquire Pinnacle (PF). Pilgrim's said it met with Hillshire in February and that it ""has long been our desire to acquire the company.""Brazil's JBS, which spent $17 billion on acquisitions in the past decade to overtake Tyson Foods (TSN), is resuming its takeover campaign less than a year after its last major deal. CEO Wesley Batista told Bloomberg News last week that JBS will keep expanding via more purchases as opportunities arise.In the U.S., JBS bought Smithfield Foods' beef-packing business in 2008 and took control of chicken processor Pilgrim's in 2009.Pulling For PorkJBS' ""Holy Grail"" is ""to have exposure to all three segments of meat: poultry, beef and pork,"" said Bloomberg Industries analyst Ken Shea. ""Today's unsolicited bid, if effected, would give JBS the third leg of a stool — a big piece of the pork market.""Hillshire said in a statement that it will review the Pilgrim's offer and that it believes in the merits of the Pinnacle deal.Pilgrim's hadn't made an offer until now because it was focused on improving its operations and paying down debt, a person familiar with its thinking said.Pilgrim's and JBS believed promised cost savings for the Hillshire-Pinnacle deal were aggressive — especially considering Pinnacle's private-equity owners had already made cuts, according to the person.Shares of Hillshire, which makes Jimmy Dean sausages and Ball Park hot dogs, rose 22% to 45.19. Pilgrim's climbed 2% to 25.52. Pinnacle fell 5% to 31.48.Ricky Sandler, CEO of Eminence Capital, said Hillshire should engage with Pilgrim's and that today's proposal is superior to the Pinnacle transaction. Hillshire should see if there are other bidders and that interest may come from Tyson, Hormel Foods (HRL) and China's WH Group, he said. Sandler last week criticized the Pinnacle deal as expensive and said that his firm, a Hillshire holder, would vote against it.Pinnacle owns brands from Vlasic pickles to Wish-Bone salad dressings to Birds Eye frozen vegetables. Blackstone (BX) bought it for $2.2 billion about seven years ago and took it public again in March 2013.Pilgrim's would get a ""pretty good deal"" with Hillshire, said Craig Sterling, analyst at EVA Dimensions in New York. Hillshire has a 6.3% profit margin vs. 4.2% for Pilgrim's, he said.

528,TSN,"This week was an eventful one with some of the major developments having a positive or negative impact on the global stock market. Below we discuss some of the biggest events that dominated the headlines and influenced the market:Trump-Kim DealThe historic summit between President Donald Trump and North Korea leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore has created history, possibly ending bitterness that lasted for 68 years. This is especially true as Trump and Kim signed an agreement, which offers undisclosed American “security guarantees” in exchange for a commitment from North Korea to “work toward complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.” Although this is a positive step, lack of details on the denuclearization process and talks of follow-up negotiation have disappointed Wall Street.  Peace talks have pushed the defense stocks down after the summit. Major defense players -- Raytheon RTN, Lockheed Martin (LMT  -  Free Report), Northrop Grumman (NOC  -  Free Report), Boeing (BA  -  Free Report) and General Dynamics (GD  -  Free Report) -- saw rough trading on the day following the announcement of denuclearization. Of these, NOC has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) while BA and RTN have a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.AT&T-Time Warner ApprovalU.S. District Court Judge Richard Leon approved AT&T’s (T  -  Free Report) $85.4 billion purchase of Time Warner  without any condition. The long-awaited decision has paved the way for a merger frenzy, which will change the landscape of the media industry. This is especially true, as Comcast (CMCSA  -  Free Report) has made a $65 billion or $35 per share bid to acquire the film production and studio assets of Twenty-First Century Fox FOXA. The move resulted in a bidding war with The Walt Disney Company (DIS  -  Free Report), which had struck a deal in November to acquire the same assets for $52.4 billion in an all-stock deal. Each of the stocks carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) while FOX downgraded to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).  Hawkish FedAs expected, the Fed has raised interest rates for the second time this year by 25 bps to 1.75-2%. This also marks the seventh rate hike since December 2015. The central bank signaled a hawkish outlook with two more lift-offs that would translate into four total increases in 2018. The decision has led to a spike in yields. The two-year Treasury yields, which are most sensitive to shifting expectations of Fed policy, rose faster than that of 10-year and 30-year yields, narrowing the spread between the short-term and long-term yields. In fact, the yields curve flattened to the levels last seen in August 2007.Generally, a rising rate scenario is highly profitable for banks, as they seek to borrow money at short-term rates and lend at long-term rates, thereby expanding net margins and bolstering banks’ profits. But this is not the case now as short-term rates are creeping higher and long-term rates are moving up slowly, leading to a decline in net margins. Still, Northern Trust Corporation (NTRS  -  Free Report) having a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and a Momentum Score of A seems an excellent pick as its earnings are expected to grow 33.13% year over year this year.Dovish ECBThe European Central Bank (ECB), currently buying €30 billion in monthly asset program, plans to reduce its asset purchases to €15 billion from October to December and then finally end the massive program. Additionally, the bank has pledged to keep interest rates at record lows at least through the summer of 2019 pointing to a dovish outlook. The move led to strong gains for European stocks, which are poised for the best week in more than three months, while euro fell sharply.A decline in euro will actually benefit exporters and the manufacturing industry, resulting in soaring stock prices. As a result, some of the top-ranked European ADRs are poised to outperform in the coming months. Statoil ASA EQNR with a market cap of $89.2 billion and SAP SE SAP with a market cap of $148 billion have a Zacks Rank #1 and 2, respectively.World Cup Buying FrenzyThe 2018 FIFA World Cup has kicked off in Russia with the high expectation of driving growth across zones, especially in industrial spaces such as media, advertising, restaurants, hotels and airlines. Some of the top-ranked (#1 or 2) stocks in these spaces include Twitter (TWTR  -  Free Report), Marriot Vacations Worldwide Corporation VAC, BJ's Restaurants, Inc. BJRI, Interpublic Group of Companies (IPG  -  Free Report), and SkyWest Inc. (SKYW  -  Free Report)  that could offer immense upside potential from the month-long event.Trump TariffTrump has approved of a plan to impose significant import tariffs on Chinese goods and is expected to announce today the first round of list for goods targeted for tariff. The move if enacted could lead to retaliation from China. Beijing earlier revealed a list of $50 billion in U.S. products that would face retaliatory tariffs, including beef and soybeans. As a result, meat producers like Tyson Foods Inc. TSN and Hormel Foods Corporation HRL could take a hit. Both stocks have a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

"
529,TSN,"Per Reuters, Mexico is set to impose a 20% tariff on U.S. pork and ham imports in response to Trump’s steel and aluminum imports levies. The president of Mexico's leading pork producers association said that it will be a 20% tariff on legs and shoulders, fresh and frozen with bones and without bones.The news is in line with the announcement from Mexico last week that it would impose duties on pork legs and shoulders from U.S. suppliers, which account for about 90% of the country’s $1.07 billion (£803.6 million) annual imports of the cuts. Since Mexico is the largest buyer of U.S. pork based on volume, the tariff will be a major setback to American meat producers. Notably, Mexico bought $1.5 billion of U.S. pork last year, representing more than 800,000 tons (read: Trade War Tensions Flare Up: Must-Watch ETFs & Stocks).U.S. pork export threats have added to the woes facing American farmers, who are already struggling with a meat glut and producers, who are already facing a 25% duty on pork exports to China. This is especially true, as global pork production is expected to grow 2% this year largely driven by an increase in China production, which accounts for about 48% of total global output.As such, it could result in unseen consequences in the pork industry. Growing trade worries have pushed pork prices lower in recent weeks, resulting in losses of about $560 million for Iowa producers.That said, we present some ETFs & stocks that could be the worst hit should Mexico follow through its threat on American hams and pork shoulders.IQ Global Resources ETF (GRES  -  Free Report)This fund seeks to offer exposure to global companies that operate in commodity-specific market segments and whose equities are traded in developed markets including the United States.

"
533,TSN,"All operating segments were profitable with Beef, Pork and the Prepared Foods segments driving the quarter. Sales volumes rose 7.2% in the Beef segment. 
"
534,TSN,"The Chicken segment, which has been lagging, showed improvement. Tyson's expects Chicken's seasonal demand and the pricing environment will improve in fiscal 2010.

540,TSN,"Earnings Preview 11/23/09
"
541,TSN,"Investors will be able to say thanks next Thursday for a wonderful earnings season, one that is rapidly drawing to a close. There will be only 57 firms reporting quarterly results next week, including 10 members of the S&P 500. That group, however, contains some pretty important names, including computer giant Hewlett-Packard (HPQ  -  Free Report), agricultural equipment king John Deere (DE  -  Free Report) and investors will find out if Campbell Soup (CPB  -  Free Report) really is ""mm-mm good."" 
"
542,TSN,"The economic data is squeezed into the front part of the week due to the holiday:Monday
"
543,TSN,"•    Existing Home Sales are expected to rise to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.65 million from 5.57 million in September. While existing home sales make up more than 85% of all home sales, their effect on the economy is minimal and largely indirect. Watch the inventory numbers, though -- a decline would be a very good thing, particularly if it results in a drop in the months of supply outstandingTuesday
"
544,TSN,"•    We get the second cut at 3rd Quarter GDP. It was originally estimated at 3.5% growth, but due to weaker-than-expected trade numbers and downward revisions to September retail sales, the consensus estimate is now that the economy grew at just 3.0% in the quarter. The GDP deflator is expected to remain unchanged at up  0.8% 
"
545,TSN,"•    The Case-Schiller home price index is expected to show that the year-over-year decline in housing prices in September was 9.10%, a significant improvement over the 11.32% decline in August. Thanks to extraordinary government support for the housing market, housing prices have started to recover, at least on a month-to-month basis. However, with a huge overhang of supply and shadow supply from seriously delinquent mortgages, this strength will probably fade by the first quarter, especially as government and central bank support diminishes
"
546,TSN,"•    The other major house price index is the FHFA report, which is expected to show a 0.3% monthly increase for September, reversing a 0.3% decline in August
"
547,TSN,"•    Consumer Confidence is expected to fall slightly to a reading of 47.5 for November from 47.7 in OctoberWednesday
"
548,TSN,"•    Personal Income is expected to have risen by 0.2% in October after being unchanged in September. Personal Spending is expected to increase 0.5%, reversing a 0.5% decline last month. Combined this means that the savings rate is falling again, which is good news short-term, but a disaster long-term
"
549,TSN,"•    Initial Claims for unemployment insurance are to be released a day early due to the holiday. Last week they were at 505,000 and have been in a downward trend since April. The decline will probably continue.
"
550,TSN,"•    New Home Sales are expected to have increased to an annual rate of 414,000 in October from 402,000 in September. This is a far more important number for the economy than existing home sales as it directly impacts residential investment. Housing starts came in very light for October, so an increase will help get inventories under better control
"
551,TSN,"•    New orders for Durable Goods are expected to have risen by 0.5% in October on top of a 1.0% rise in September. Excluding the very volatile Transportation sector they are expected to be up 1.0% after a 0.9% rise last month
"
552,TSN,"•    The University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index is expected to show an increase to 66.5 from 66.0 last weekThursday
"
553,TSN,"•    Caloric consumption is expected to hit its high for the year, but this is highly seasonal and should be roughly flat with a year ago
"
554,TSN,"•     Belts are loosened, naps taken and football is watchedFriday
"
555,TSN,"•    People wake up early to stampede into the malls
"
556,TSN,"•    Leftover turkey sandwiches are consumedPotential Positive Surprises
"
557,TSN,"Historically the best indicators of firms which are likely to report positive surprises are a recent history of positive surprises and rising estimates going into the report. The Zacks Rank is also a good indicator of potential surprises. Some of the companies that have these characteristics include:Deere (DE  -  Free Report) is expected to post EPS of just $0.05, down from $0.81 last year. That low expectation sets it up for a positive surprise. Last time out they beat by 73.7%. However there has been no change in the estimate over the last month, and the stock has a neutral Zacks Rank of 3Tyson (TSN  -  Free Report), the poultry producer, might just make its investors thankful. It is expected to earn $0.26, up from $0.14 last year. Last time out it beat by 83.3%. However, analysts have slightly shaved the mean estimate by 0.6% over the last month.Potential Negative Surprises
"
558,TSN,"In keeping with the overall very positive tone of this earnings season, the potential negative firms are less clear cut. However:BJ Services (BJS) is expected to post EPS of just $0.03, down from $0.57 last year. It badly missed estimates last time, reporting a loss instead of income and analysts have cut the estimates for this year’s quarter by 11.1% over the last month.

560,TSN,"After months of rhetorical tariff threats between Washington and Beijing, the world’s two largest economies have declared a trade war. This is especially true as Trump’s 25% tariff on $34 billion in Chinese goods, including auto, electric cars, aerospace, communications tech, new materials and robotics became reality at 12:01 A.M. on Jul 6 and another $16 billion is expected to go into effect in two weeks.China also hit back with the same scale and strength, slapping charges on American goods targeting heartland staples like soybeans, corn, pork and poultry. The United States has violated World Trade Organization rules and ignited the largest trade war in economic history,” China’s Commerce Ministry said in a statement. With retaliation from Beijing, Trump has issued warnings of additional tariffs on $500 billion in Chinese goods.The latest move marked the escalation of the trade war from threat to reality and would result in a global recession. It would hurt global supply chains, increase costs for businesses and consumers and slow down investments. Canada, Mexico and Europe are also engaged in tit-for-tat tariff exchange with the United States. As a result, the ongoing development suggests that the worst, which could send shockwaves across stock markets, is yet to come.Against such a backdrop, there are a few places where investors can stash their cash in the stock world and a few that should be avoided.Best ZonesGoldIn difficult market environments, gold is considered a great store of value and hedge against market turmoil. Acting as a leveraged play on the underlying metal prices, metal miners tend to experience more gains than their bullion cousins in a rising metal market. Hence, mining stocks could outperform in the current trade turmoil. As such, Yamana Gold Inc. (AUY) seems a lucrative pick as it carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and a Momentum Score of A. The stock has risen 8.1% over the past month.Consumer StaplesThe consumer staples sector is defensive as it includes a variety of items like food & beverages, non-durable household goods, hypermarkets and consumer supercenters that are every-day essentials. These products see steady demand even during an economic downturn due to their low level of correlation with economic cycles. As such, these generally act as a safe haven amid political and economic turmoil. Stocks in these sectors generally outperform during periods of low growth and high uncertainty. Among these, B&G Foods Inc. (BGS) has gained 12% over the past one month. It carries a Zacks Rank #2 and a Momentum Score of B.Small CapsSmall-cap stocks have been the winners amid trade and tariff threats, and are likely to continue their outperformance. This is because small-cap stocks have less international exposure and generate most of their revenues from the domestic market. These pint-sized stocks are less vulnerable to a trade war or any other political issue and could better insulate investors from Trump’s protectionist stance. Rent-A-Center Inc. (RCII) having a Zacks Rank #2 and a VGM Score of A is among the biggest gainers in a month’s time, rising 42.5%.  High DividendThe dividend-paying securities are the major sources of consistent income for investors when returns from the equity market are at risk. These stocks offer the safety in the form of payouts and stability in the form of mature companies that are less volatile to the large swings in stock prices. The companies that offer dividends generally act as a hedge against economic uncertainty and provide downside protection by offering outsized payouts or sizable yields on a regular basis. While there are several top-ranked options available in the space, Arbor Realty Trust (ABR  -  Free Report) looks impressive given its Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and one-month return of 13.5%. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Worst ZonesFarm BeltU.S. farmers and food producers are in the crosshairs of a global trade conflict. Tariffs were already imposed by Canada on beef and by Mexico on pork and ham imports. Another round of tariff from China on soybeans and pork also come into effect in response to Trump’s latest tariff implementation. Soybean exporters like Archer Daniels Midland Company (ADM  -  Free Report) and meat producers like Tyson Foods Inc. (TSN  -  Free Report) and Hormel Foods Corporation (HRL  -  Free Report) would be hit. ADM has a Zacks Rank #2 and added 3.6% in a month while the other two has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). TSN is down 2.3% and HRL is up 1.7%.AutoThe potential tariffs on cars and auto components are the greatest threats to the auto industry. Global Automakers President and CEO John Bozzella warned “tariff hikes would raise prices, make it more expensive to produce cars and trucks in the United States. He said the tariffs could cause a slowdown in sales and production, which would not be good for either American consumers or autoworkers.” BorgWarner Inc. (BWA  -  Free Report) shed 13.9% in a month and has a Zacks Rank #3.SemiconductorsTrump’s import tariff on Chinese products will compel American semiconductor companies to pay duties on their own products. This is because chips are manufactured in the United States but are shipped to the Asian nation for assembly, testing and packaging due to its favorable labor costs, according to the Semiconductor Industry Association. Some of the worst-hit chip stocks include Intel (INTC  -  Free Report), Micron (MU  -  Free Report) and Texas Instruments (TXN  -  Free Report). INTC, MU and TXN were down 12.9%, 12.9% and 5.9%, respectively. However, these stocks have a favorable Zacks rank.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge. With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research. It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

561,TSN,"Tyson Foods Inc. (TSN  -  Free Report) has been witnessing year-over-year growth in the top line for quite some time now, largely owing to its efforts to strengthen its protein-packed brands as well as focus on strategic buyouts.The robust top-line growth trend was retained in the second quarter fiscal 2018, wherein improved Beef, Chicken and Prepared Foods sales were major drivers. Further, the Prepared Foods category has been depicting solid growth in particular, owing to rising demand for protein-packed brands and positive synergies from the acquisition of AdvancePierre.Notably, the company’s AdvancePierre buyout has been favoring the Prepared Foods segment for a while. The acquisition led to a 10.9%, 11.6%, rise in sales volume for the segment during the second and first quarters of fiscal 2018, respectively. Prior to this, it rose 2.4% during the third quarter and 9.5% in fourth-quarter fiscal 2017. Further, the company expects incremental sales of approximately $1.1 billion from AdvancePierre during fiscal 2018.Other notable acquisitions that have been driving Tyson Foods’ top line include; Tecumseh Poultry, Original Philly Holdings, Hillshire as well as Mexican food restaurant chains, Circle Foods and Don Julio Foods.Tyson Foods is also gaining from its solid efforts to expand its protein-packed brands amid the rising protein demand. In this regard, the company has invested in Memphis Meats and Beyond Meat. It has also undertaken divesture of non-protein businesses (such as Sara Lee Frozen Bakery, Kettle and Van’s) so as to focus more on the growing protein-packed food arena.These endeavors are likely to help the company reap the benefits of rising protein demand. For fiscal 2018, USDA expects overall domestic protein production (chicken, beef, pork and turkey) to rise roughly 3% year over year. Moreover, Tyson Foods anticipates fiscal 2018 sales to increase nearly 6% in the range of $40-$41 billion, courtesy of higher revenues from AdvancePierre; increased volumes in its legacy business and enhanced mix in the Chicken segment.High Cost BurdenHowever, Tyson Foods has been witnessing higher freight expenses which negatively impacted operating income across Beef, Chicken, Pork and Prepared Foods segments during the second quarter of fiscal 2018. The company expects these hurdles to linger, which remains a threat to its profits. Such factors have also been dragging investors’ optimism. Evidently, shares of Tyson Foods declined 2% in the past one month, compared with the industry’s drop of 0.8%.Nevertheless, the company remains on track with its Financial Fitness Program, which aims to generate total savings of roughly $200 million in fiscal 2018, $400 million in 2019 and $600 million in 2020. We are hopeful that this program will help offset the above-mentioned cost woes in the near future.Looking for Promising Food stocks?

562,TSN,"Helen of Troy Limited (HELE  -  Free Report) is slated to release first-quarter fiscal 2019 results on Jul 9. This consumer products player has delivered positive earnings surprise for eleven straight quarters now. Let’s see what’s in store for the company this time around.Helen of Troy Limited Price and EPS Surprise  Helen of Troy Limited Price and EPS Surprise | Helen of Troy Limited QuoteFactors Driving Helen of TroyHelen of Troy is likely to continue gaining from its Transformation Plan, which concentrates on making investments in core areas, undertaking customer-centric innovations, undertaking prudent mergers and acquisitions, building superior shared services, making upgrades to workforce and systems, and reducing wastage to improve quality and curtail costs. These factors drove Helen of Troy in the last reported quarter, wherein top and bottom lines improved year over year and came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Results were driven by solid performance by Leadership Brands along with growth in online sales. Markedly, Helen of Troy has been focused on making solid investments in its Leadership Brands, which are considered most productive as they have been delivering robust results.To this end, the company is on track with its investments in product launches, marketing efforts and e-commerce strategies for these brands, which are the highest margin, greatest volume generating and most efficient businesses for the company. Further, the company is likely to keep gaining from its consistent online sales and digital marketing efforts, on the back of which online sales increased in all three segments in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018. Talking of segments, the company’s Health & Home unit delivered one of its best quarters in a long time.Will the Hurdles Be Offset?However, the company’s Beauty segment sales did not witness even a single quarter of year-over-year growth, throughout fiscal 2018. The Beauty segment has been suffering from softness in personal care category, mainly due to tough competition. In the fourth quarter, Beauty segment sales fell 2.1% on account of weakness across brick and mortar channels. Further, Beauty sales are projected to dip in low to mid-single digits in fiscal 2019, which remains a concern for the top line in the quarter under review as well.Also, on the cost front, the company witnessed contraction in gross and operating margin in the fourth quarter. Gross margin fell 30 basis points, due to increased promotions and adverse channel mix. Further, SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales escalated 60 basis points on account of increased incentive compensation, and higher advertising and new product development costs, among others.Well, overall rise in commodity and transportation costs creates a competitive pricing environment, which keeps margins under pressure. Moreover, management expects fiscal 2019 bottom-line growth to be hit by a rise in investments to fuel the company’s Leadership Brands.  Nonetheless, the aforementioned growth drivers as well as Helen of Troy’s Project Refuel should help the company overcome these hurdles. The Project Refuel restructuring plan was initiated to improve the performance of the company’s Beauty and Nutritional Supplements units.

Sales volume dropped 7.1% and average selling price in the segment climbed 8.9%. The segment incurred adjusted operating loss of $15 million compared with the loss of $16 million in the year-ago quarter.Other Financial UpdatesTyson Foods exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalent of $198 million, long-term debt of $8,872 million and shareholders’ equity of $12,156 million.The company generated cash flow from operating activities of $1,139 million in the second quarter.

564,TSN,"Tyson Foods, Inc (TSN  -  Free Report), which is bent on expanding its protein-rich products, revealed plans to acquire Tecumseh Poultry LLC, a renowned branded organic chicken producer. The deal will add the popular air-chilled Smart Chicken brand along with a variety of chicken sausages, fresh and deli-style chicken to Tyson Foods’ portfolio. Tecumseh Poultry’s operations are mainly carried out through two plants in Nebraska, which will now form part of Tyson Foods’ business.Tecumseh Poultry: Another Bountiful AdditionWell, this news came in just after the company announced the sale of non-protein business — Van’s and Sara Lee Frozen Bakery. Notably, Tyson Foods’ latest move underscores its constant efforts to expand protein-rich offerings, as the demand for such products has been growing and is expected to rise further. Along with the widening demography of protein-savvy consumers, consumers’ demand for fresh and organic food options have been growing rapidly, courtesy of rising health consciousness.Considering these factors, Tyson Foods’ latest move to bring Tecumseh Poultry under its wings fits well and is expected to adequately bolster the company’s organic chicken offerings. Markedly, Tecumseh Poultry uses air-chilling techniques to process chicken, a method that is monitored by the USDA and is considered safe. Moreover, the Smart Chicken brand is quite popular and holds a strong market position in the fresh chicken category. Management stated that Tecumseh Poultry, will be operated as a separate wholly-owned subsidiary. Apart from this, the company’s organic products include brands such as Aidells and NatureRaised Farms. Other Strides in Bolstering Protein OfferingsTyson Foods’ growing appetite for protein-rich products has propelled the company to constantly strike new deals to augment protein-packed offerings. In addition to expanding organic foods, the company has been venturing into alternative sources for meat and protein products, evident from the buyouts of Beyond Meat and Memphis Meats. Further, the company has made several investments to strengthen poultry production in Tennessee. Such efforts, combined with the acquisition of AdvancePierre and Original Philly, indicate the company’s dedicated efforts on augmenting protein-rich food products.Driven by such fruitful ventures, Tyson Foods’ Chicken, Beef and Prepared Foods segments have been delivering a solid performance since the past few quarters. Management expects demand for protein to continue rising and is on track to make most of all opportunities in the space. Such efforts have also been boosting investors’ confidence in this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock that has rallied 15.5% in the past year compared with the industry’s 4.9% gain. That said, we expect the latest inclusion of Tecumseh Poultry to reward and further augment the company’s performance.Greedy for More Consumer Staples Stocks?

565,TSN,"Trade war fears between the United States and its trading partners have been rife since March. Trump’s announcement in early March that the United States will impose a 25% tariff on steel imports and a 10% tariff on aluminum imports first spooked the market.The situation eased a little when Trump administration granted a temporary relief from tariffs to some of its key allies like European Union, Canada, Mexico, Argentina, Australia, Brazil and South Korea. However, China was not part of that exemption and a tussle over trade with China has been going on since March (read: ETFs to be Impacted by Trump's Tariff Exemptions).Trump Flip-Flops on Trade United States and China announced a $50-billion import tariff on each other, only to put the war “on hold” for a while. Then again, at May-end, Washington announced a 25% tariff on $50 billion worth of goods from China and imposed new limits on Chinese investments in the United States (read: Trump, Tariff & Geopolitics Lead May: 10 Top ETF Stories).Plus, tariffs on metal imports from the EU, Canada and Mexico will be put into effect from Jun 1, as exemption offered earlier in the year lapsed. Needless to say, the United States now needs to be prepared for a chain of tit-for-tat tariffs on a range of products.Retaliations in Cue Mexico has already retaliated by levying measures on U.S. farm and industrial products, targeting pork legs, apples, grapes and cheeses. Investors should note that about 22% of U.S. pork is exported out of which Mexico buys the maximum.Canada plans to slam retaliatory tariffs on $12.8 billion worth of U.S. exports and contest the steel and aluminum tariffs under the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the World Trade Organization (WTO), per Reuters. The EU is also planning a legal challenge via the WTO.Against this backdrop, we highlight some industries that could be impacted the most by the tariffs.Food and Meat Producers The S&P 500 Packaged Foods and Meats index shed about 2% on the retaliation news, per Reuters. A professor of agricultural economics at Purdue expects this tariff along with supply glut in the meat market to cause average losses for U.S. hog farmers of about $9 per animal in 2018 and $13 in 2019. No wonder, Tyson Foods Inc. TSN, processor and marketer of chicken, beef, and pork, lost about 4.3% on May 31 on Mexico’s tit-for-tat tariff announcement.  Food and beverage companies like Kraft Heinz Company KHC (down 2.3% on May 31) and Hormel Foods Corporation HRL (down 3.4% on May 31) also featured in the losers’ list.Consumer Staples ETFs like First Trust Nasdaq Food & Beverage ETF FTXG, First Trust Consumer Staples AlphaDEX Fund (FXG  -  Free Report), VanEck Vectors Agribusiness ETF MOO and PowerShares Dynamic Food and Beverage (PBJ  -  Free Report) and S&P 500 Equal Weight Consumer Staples Portfolio (RHS  -  Free Report) have exposure to the afore-mentioned companies and could thus be hit hard.Semiconductor U.S. chipmakers have the largest sales exposure to China. So, renewed tariff tensions with China could bring back pain in the semiconductor space. iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF (SOXX  -  Free Report) was down about 0.7% on May 31 (read: 4 Best Performing Sector ETFs of May).AerospaceU.S. aerospace industry thrives on steel and aluminum imports to construct aircraft. About 80% of an aircraft is made of aluminum. Companies like Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) (down 1.7%) and Lockheed Martin (LMT  -  Free Report) (down 1.9%) may come under pressure.Also, China is a key market for Boeing where it serves as the largest exporter of America. So, any tension with China doesn’t bode well for Boeing. Aerospace and defense ETFs like iShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense ETF (ITA  -  Free Report) and SPDR S&P Aerospace & Defense ETF (XAR  -  Free Report) may also feel the pinch.CandyAluminum foils are used to wrap chocolates. So, the tariff could lead to higher input costs for Hershey Company HSY (down 1.7%) and Mondelez International Inc. MDLZ (down 0.9%).BeerImported aluminum is used to make beer cans. Companies like Molson Coors Brewing Company (TAP  -  Free Report) (down 1.1%) and Constellation Brands Inc. STZ) (down 0.8%) may face the rising cost issue. At the same time, the announcement puts Spirited Funds/ETFMG Whiskey & Spirits ETF  in focus.Auto Both steel and aluminum are vital to the production of cars and trucks sold in America and would drive the sale prices of those vehicles considerably. Also, the Trump administration has initiated a national security investigation into auto imports. All these put First Trust NASDAQ Global Auto Index Fund (CARZ  -  Free Report) in an edgy spot (read: U.S. Auto Tariff Risk Put These ETFs and Stocks in Focus).Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week. Get it free >>

566,TSN,"Tyson Foods, Inc. (TSN  -  Free Report) continues to grapple with rising labor and freight expenses. These factors dragged the company’s operating profits in most segments in second-quarter fiscal 2018. Further, the company’s Pork sales volumes have been sluggish lately. Owing to such deterrents, shares of the company have declined 8.6% in the past three months compared with the industry’s 3.7% slip.Fretting Over Rising CostsTyson Foods has been increasing employee investments to improve productivity, which has been raising cost burden. Such factors were a headwind in the company’s Chicken, Beef and Pork segments during the second quarter of fiscal 2018. Also, the company has been witnessing higher freight expenses. Evidently, higher freight expenses affected operating income in most of the company’s segments during the second quarter. Going ahead, this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company expects these hurdles to linger, which is likely to increase overall expenses in fiscal 2018.  Pork Volumes Look DismalAlthough Tyson Foods’ has been witnessing growth in the Chicken, Beef and Prepared Foods segments, sales volumes in the Pork category has been slipping lately. In fact, during the fourth quarter, the segment’s sales volume declined 1.1% year over year. This was largely due to the company’s efforts to reduce volumes to match production with consumer demand. Additionally, adverse weather conditions and staffing issues were a headwind in this category during the quarter.Further, China’s recent tariff hikes on pork have caused dark clouds to hover on the meat industry. The raised tariff rate is likely to cause significant loss of market in China for several meat exporters, including Tyson Foods. This might dampen the company’s revenues in the Pork segment during the forthcoming periods.Final ThoughtsWhile the aforementioned factors have made investors apprehensive, there are several bright spots that are encouraging. Notably, booming sales in the company’s Chicken, Beef and Prepared Foods categories has been aiding performance for a while. In fact, this, combined with cost savings from the Financial Fitness program and positive synergies from the AdvancePierre’ buyout, bolstered the company’s second-quarter fiscal 2018 performance. Encouragingly, management expects such upsides to sustain in the forthcoming periods. We hope that these factors will aid the company to achieve a turnaround in its price performance and raise investors’ optimism in the stock.Greedy for Consumer Staples Stocks?

567,TSN,"Pilgrim's Pride Corporation (PPC  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 10, after the market closes.The company reported better-than-expected results in three of the last four quarters, while lagging in one. Average earnings surprise was a positive 8.62%. Notably, in the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings of 58 cents per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 9.43%.In the last three months, the company’s shares have declined 16.4%, worse than the 5.3% decline of the industry it belongs to.Let us see how things are shaping up for the company prior to this announcement. Factors to Influence Q1 ResultsPilgrim's Pride faces a number of headwinds, which, if materialize, might prove detrimental to its financial performance. Foremost is the supply constraint of intermediate inputs, including corn, soybean and sorghum. Also, a sudden surge in costs of these inputs can put pressure on the product margin.In addition, the company is not immune to risks arising from international operations. For instance, expired import quotas in some overseas markets, supply-chain setbacks in Mexico, commodity-cost inflation in the European end-markets, and unfavorable foreign-currency movements might impact operations/financials adversely. Moreover, a sudden outbreak of livestock diseases within the meat industry can influence import and export policies of fresh chicken products of the governments of the nations served.Furthermore, intense competition in the industry makes heavy investments in innovative and growth projects an imperative for Pilgrim's Pride. This, in some cases, results in rising debt burden and financial obligations.However, these negative aspects are partially offset by rising demand for organic chicken products, driven by increased protein-based dietary habits and rising disposable income levels. Also, to leverage benefits from rising product demand, Pilgrim's Pride is offering new products to its customers under popular brands like Just Bare.Stronger productivity of the Moorefield, WV-facility, sturdy ramp-up of the Vera Cruz facility, diligent cost-saving initiatives, greater operational excellence and reduced corporate tax rates are expected to be a boon. Also, successful integrations of GNP Company (acquired in January 2017) and Moy Park (acquired in September 2017) will generate more synergies in the upcoming quarters. Earnings WhispersOur proven model provides some idea about the stocks that are about to release their earnings results.

568,TSN,"Crude oil prices crept up over $70 per barrel for the first time in the global market since late-2014, before a long-term slide in prices took many economies into tougher times, including a relatively short-term dip in U.S. equities during our near-decade-long bull run. This comes as most headline-grabbing companies have already reported results from calendar Q1 earnings season, and without a lot of economic data on the docket for the current week.Why investors may pay closer attention to the price of oil this week — aside from already present spikes in gasoline prices at the pump — is because the May 12 deadline for whether the U.S. remains of the accord with Iran passed during the Obama administration that lifts economic sanctions in exchange for Iran keeping dormant its nuclear weapons development. President Trump has been a big opponent of this deal, both as a candidate and as president. Even with visits to the White House by people like France’s President Macron to assuage Trump to keep the U.S. within the agreement, odds are — like with the Paris Climate Accord — that we are likely to be out by week’s end.It’s unclear what the immediate implications of this step would be, but that in itself is part of the problem: the stock market abhors uncertainty. In addition to higher oil prices — which may continue to spike as relations between the U.S. and Iran become more frayed — military tensions may increase as a result of this negated agreement, not just between the West and Middle East, but within the region itself. Hezbollah, formed initially in Iran, now wields influence in countries like Lebanon, which borders on Israel, the U.S.’s main ally in the region.This is not the arena in which to debate U.S. foreign policy, but it is worth noting that a collapse in the Iran accord is likely to increase geopolitical concerns for investors in the U.S. stock market. Crude oil prices are already seeing the affect of this to a point, but ramifications have the potential of reaching much further. It would thus be reasonable to see market participants taking a guarded approach to investing ahead of the deadline this Saturday and beyond.Ahead of Monday’s opening bell, Tyson Foods (TSN  -  Free Report) reported a fiscal Q2 2018 miss on both top and bottom lines: $1.27 per share versus $1.32 was nevertheless up 25.7% year over year. Quarterly sales of $9.78 billion was short of the $9.94 billion Zacks consensus estimate. Earnings guidance for full-year 2018 was in-line with Q2 earnings results, +$6.55-6.70, between 23-25% year over year). For more on TSN’s earnings, click here.Another food-producing major, SYSCO Corp. (SYY  -  Free Report) reported mixed results for its fiscal Q3 2018 — earnings of 67 cents per share beat consensus by 3 cents (and rose 43% year over year), while revenues narrowly missed expectations when they came in at $14.35 billion in the quarter. Even still, SYY shares are up marginally in today’s pre-market. For more on SYY’s earnings, click here.

569,TSN,"Tyson Foods, Inc (TSN  -  Free Report) recently entered into an agreement with private-equity firm — Kohlberg & Company — to sell its Sara Lee Frozen Bakery and Van’s businesses. The deal will include the sale of brands such as Chef Pierre, Bistro Collection, Van’s brands and license usage rights of Sara Lee brand across certain channels. It also comprises wind-up of two prepared foods facilities located in Tarboro and Traverse City as well as sales office in Canada.Industry experts view the deal as part of the company’s strategy to focus on protein-packed brands.Greater Focus on Protein Brands Bodes WellWell, Tyson Foods’ growing appetite for protein-rich products has propelled the company to divest non-protein businesses. Apart from Sara Lee and Vans businesses, the company earlier divested its Kettle business and is also on the look-out for potential buyers for its pizza crust unit.Although Tyson Foods continues to reduce non-protein offerings, it constantly strikes new deals to augment protein-packed offerings. In fact, the company has been venturing into alternative sources for meat and protein products, as evident from the buyouts of Beyond Meat and Memphis Meats. Apart from this, the company has been steadily expanding fresh prepared foods offerings, owing to consumers’ rising demand for natural fresh meat offerings without any added hormones or antibiotics. Further, the company has made several investments to strengthen poultry production in Tennessee. Such efforts, combined with the acquisition of AdvancePierre and Original Philly, indicate the company’s dedicated efforts on augmenting protein-rich food products.Driven by such fruitful ventures, Tyson Foods’ Chicken, Beef and Prepared Foods segments have been depicting a solid performance since the past few quarters. Management expects demand for protein to continue rising and is on track to exploit all opportunities in the space. For fiscal 2018, USDA expects overall domestic protein production (chicken, beef, pork and turkey) to rise roughly 3% year over year.Wrapping it UpWe note that Tyson Foods has been struggling with rising freight costs. Also, the company has been increasing employee investments to improve productivity, which has been bumping up overall costs. Such factors have been weighing on the company’s shares, which declined 7.5% in the past six months compared with the industry’s 4.3% fall.Nevertheless, we expect this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s Financial Fitness Program to induce savings and help alleviate cost-related issues to an extent. Moreover, the planned divestitures are likely to increase focus on key growth areas and utilize resources in the desired channels.Greedy for More Consumer Staples Stocks?

570,TSN,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Tyson Foods Inc. (TSN  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Tyson Foods has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 12.2, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 19.7x. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, Tyson Foods’ current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the broader industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 13. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that Tyson Foods has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 10.7, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for the stock in the near term too.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Tyson Foods has a P/S ratio of about 0.7. This is a bit lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.3x right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Tyson Foods currently has a Value Score of A, putting it into the top 20% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes Tyson Foods a solid choice for value investors.What About the Stock Overall?Though Tyson Foods might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of C and a Momentum Score of F. This gives TSN a Zacks VGM score — or its overarching fundamental grade — of B. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been discouraging. The current quarter has seen two estimates go lower in the past sixty days compared to none higher, while the full year estimate has seen one up and three down in the same time period.As a result, the current quarter consensus estimate has decreased by 2.8% in the past month, while the full year estimate has inched lower by 0.5%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Tyson Foods, Inc. Price and Consensus Tyson Foods, Inc. Price and Consensus | Tyson Foods, Inc. QuoteThis bearish trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and why we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineTyson Foods is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Also, with a good industry rank (top 13%) the company deserves attention right now. However, over the past year, the broader industry has clearly underperformed the market at large, as you can see below: So, value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

571,TSN,"Tyson Foods, Inc. (TSN  -  Free Report) could be a stock to avoid from a technical perspective, as the firm is seeing unfavorable trends on the moving average crossover front. Recently, the 50 Day Moving Average for TSN broke out below the 200 Day Simple Moving Average, suggesting short-term bearishness.This has already started to take place, as the stock has moved lower by 5.2% in the past four weeks. And with the recent moving average crossover, investors have to think that more unfavorable trading is ahead for TSN stock.If that wasn’t enough, Tyson Foods isn’t looking too great from an earnings estimate revision perspective either. It appears as though many analysts have been reducing their earnings expectations for the stock lately, which is usually not a good sign of things to come.Consider that in the last 30 days, 3 estimates have been reduced, while none has moved higher. Add this in to a similar move lower in the consensus estimate, and there is plenty of reason to be bearish here.That is why we currently have a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) on this stock and are looking for it to underperform in the weeks ahead. So either avoid this stock or consider jumping ship until the estimates and technical factors turn around for TSN.

572,TSN,"McCormick & Company Inc. (MKC  -  Free Report) has been faring well in the industry, buoyed by yielding buyouts and cost-containment efforts. This has aided year-over-year growth in top and bottom lines for more than a year now. Let’s now look into some of the factors that have been supporting this global leader in spices and seasonings, alongside analyzing the hurdles that have been denting performance.Acquisitions Provide Scope for Growth  Buyouts have been aiding McCormick to expand flavors business and reap grater profitability. The buyout of the food division of RB Foods in August 2017, is the largest deal by the company till date. With iconic brands like Frank's RedHot Sauce and French's Mustard, RB Foods is likely to continue as an asset for McCormick’s spices portfolio.The buyouts of RB Foods and Enrico Giotti SpA bolstered performances of consumer and flavor solutions units, driving sales by 12% during the first quarter of fiscal 2018. Notably, a number of companies operating in the food industry such as TreeHouse Foods (THS  -  Free Report) and Sysco Corp. (SYY  -  Free Report) have also been resorting to strategic buyouts to widen prospects.Effective Cost ManagementMoving on, McCormick’s Comprehensive Continuous Improvement (“CCI”) program has been an aspect of cheer for a while. The program aids the company to focus on savings and enhance productivity. It has used CCI savings to increase investments, which lead to higher sales and profits.  Notably, cost savings from CCI improved the company’s gross and adjusted operating income margins during the first quarter of fiscal 2018.This also marked the company’s ninth consecutive quarter of adjusted operating income margin expansion. Further, the company projects adjusted operating income growth in the range of 23-25% in fiscal 2018, wherein it plans to achieve cost savings of $100 million.Resorting to cost-saving initiatives to induce efficiency is a common practice in the consumer staples space. For instance, Tyson Foods’ (TSN  -  Free Report) is on track with its Financial Fitness Program with the motive to induce supply-chain efficiencies, reduce overheads and fuel the bottom line. Tax Gains: A Joy HamperDuring the first quarter, McCormick recognized gains of $297.9 million from the recent U.S. Tax Act. This not only boosted the company’s bottom line for the period, but also led management to pass on a portion of its gains to well-deserved employees. Incidentally, McCormick announced bonuses worth $1,000 and plans to increase hourly wage rates for hourly U.S. employees.Improving wage structure is just one part of McCormick’s plans to strategically reap benefits from the tax reform. The company also plans to invest in organizational growth, debt reduction and provide returns to shareholders.Gains from tax cuts have enabled management to raise earnings outlook for fiscal 2018. Earnings are expected in the range of $4.85-$4.95, reflecting growth from the previous projection of $4.80-$4.90. The view also takes into consideration the estimated positive impact of nearly one percentage point from currency fluctuations.Final ThoughtsIn spite of the aforementioned upsides, McCormick’s performance continues to be eclipsed by escalating raw material costs, brand marketing and freight expenses. Incidentally, for fiscal 2018, the company expects material costs to escalate in low-single digits.Nevertheless, we expect this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company to easily tide over such hurdles, courtesy of well-chalked savings initiatives. Additionally, positive impacts of buyouts and currency fluctuations are expected to fuel sales growth of approximately 13-15% in fiscal 2018. Indeed, such aspects have been a treat for investors, evident from the stock’s return of 10.9% in the past six months against the industry’s fall of 7.4%.

574,TSN,"Sales growth is an important metric for any company, as it is a vital part of growth projections and instrumental in strategic decision-making. It provides an insight into product demand and pricing power. By monitoring this key metric over multiple time periods, one can easily understand a company’s growth trend.Sales growth is important to justify the fixed and variable expenses incurred to operate a business. Low revenues lead to an unprofitable business and disappointing financial performance. Stagnant companies may generate near-term profit but can’t rev up enough growth to attract new investors.Also, in a growing economy, lack of sales growth most likely denotes that the company is not gaining market share over its competitors. In simple terms, some sustained sales growth is essential to support the bottom line.Focusing solely on sales growth is not enough though. A healthy sales growth rate is certainly a positive indicator for picking good stocks, but it does not ensure profits. So, taking into consideration a company’s cash position along with its sales number can prove to be a more dependable strategy.Substantial cash on hand and a steady cash flow give a company more flexibility with respect to business decisions and potential investments. Cash also enables a company to endure market downturns. Most importantly, a sufficient cash position indicates that revenues are being channelized in the right direction.Picking the Winning StocksIn order to shortlist stocks that have witnessed impressive sales growth along with a high cash balance, we have selected 5-Year Historical Sales Growth (%) greater than X-Industry and Cash Flow greater than $500 million as our main screening parameters.But sales growth and cash strength are not the absolute criteria for selecting stocks. So, we added certain other factors to arrive at a winning strategy.Price-to-Sales (P/S) Ratio less than X-Industry: This metric determines the value placed on each dollar of a company’s revenues. The lower the ratio, the better it is for picking a stock since the investor is paying less for each unit of sales.% Change F1 Sales Estimate Revisions (4 Weeks) greater than X-Industry: Better-than-industry estimate revision has often been seen to trigger an increase in stock price.Operating Margin (Average Last 5 years) greater than 5%: Operating margin measures how much every dollar of a company's sales translates into profits. A high ratio indicates that the company has good cost control and sales are increasing faster than costs, an optimal situation for the company.Return on Equity (ROE) greater than 5%: This metric will ensure that sales growth is translated into profits and the company is not hoarding cash. A high ROE means the company is spending wisely and is in all likelihood profitable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.

575,TSN,"Tyson Foods, Inc.’s (TSN  -  Free Report) subsidiaries announced plans to acquire poultry rendering and blending assets of AMPRO Products, Inc. and American Proteins, Inc. The deal will enable Tyson Foods to bolster animal products recycling capabilities, which will aid in expanding animal feed business. Worth almost $850 million, the deal is subject to certain customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals.That said, let’s delve into how the company’s latest stride in the animal rendering arena will impact its performance.Recycling to Aid Animal FeedThe buyouts will help Tyson Foods gain four rendering facilities located in Alabama and Georgia along with 13 blending plants situated across Southeastern and Midwestern states. Moreover, close to 700 employees who work for American Proteins, are likely to form part of Tyson Foods team, which will bolster the company’s workforce.The newly-acquired facilities will significantly boost Tyson Foods’ animal byproducts business unit. Management believes that animal rendering plays a crucial role in the company’s operations, as it lowers wastes radically and supports recycling animal products for feed, pet food as well as aquaculture.Well that’s not just it, the deal will also enable Tyson Foods to meet sustainability goals as rendering is considered to be an environment-friendly method for preventing animal products going into landfills. This would also enable the company to minimize greenhouse gas emissionsBuyouts Aid Tysons Foods ExpansionTyson Foods never seems to lose its appetite for buyouts and constantly strikes new deals to augment offerings. Such a strategy is well suited for meeting the rising demand for protein-rich products. In fact, the company has been venturing into alternative sources for meat and protein products, evident from the buyouts of Beyond Meat and Memphis Meats. Apart from this, the company has been steadily expanding fresh prepared foods offering, owing to consumers’ rising demand for natural fresh meat offerings without any added hormones or antibiotics. Further, Tysons Foods has made several investments to strengthen poultry production in Tennessee. Such efforts combined with the acquisition of AdvancePierre and Original Philly indicate the company’s dedicated focus on augmenting protein-rich food products.Driven by such fruitful ventures, Tyson Foods’ Chicken, Beef and Prepared Foods segments have been depicting a solid performance since the past few quarters. Management expects demand for protein to continue rising and is on track to exploit all opportunities in the space. For fiscal 2018, USDA expects overall domestic protein production (chicken, beef, pork and turkey) to rise roughly 3% year over year.  Wrapping it UpWe note that Tyson Foods has been struggling with rising freight costs. Also, the company has been increasing employee investments to improve productivity, which has been raising cost burden. Such factors have been weighing on this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company’s performance, which declined 13.7% in the past six months compared with the industry’s 11.3% fallNevertheless, we expect that the company’s efforts to reduce expenses combined with strategic efforts to drive sales will suitably offset cost-related hurdles. Moreover, the latest move to enhance animal rendering capacity is projected to strengthen Tyson Foods’ footing in the food space, particularly its animal feed business.Greedy for Consumer Staples Stocks?

577,TSN,"Tyson Foods, Inc. (TSN  -  Free Report), which has been trying all means to increase focus on protein-rich products, revealed that it is looking for potential buyers for its pizza crust business, TNT Crust. The idea behind this planned divestiture is to focus more on the company’s key growth area — protein-packed offerings.Well, Tyson Foods has long been riding on this strategy, given the escalating consumer demand for protein products. Prior to this, the company had undertaken divestiture of several other non-protein business such as Sara Lee Frozen Bakery, Kettle and Van’s so as to focus more on the growing protein-packed food arena.Thus, the sale of its pizza crust business would be another step in this path. We note that this business forms part of Tyson Foods’ Prepared Foods segment, which recorded a 21% surge in revenues to $2,292 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. However, much of this is attributable to contributions from AdvancePierre, which was acquired last year with an intent to bolster the company’s protein-packed offerings. This, in itself speaks volumes about the surging preference toward this food category.Divesting Pizza Crust: Another Solid Growth Strategy Coming back to yesterday’s development, management stated that the divestiture of TNT Crust will involve the sale of Tyson Foods’ pizza crust venture of flat breads, self-rising crusts and partially baked crusts. Also, it will include the sale of two manufacturing facilities in Green Bay, Wisconsin. Thus, the deal is likely to be promising to any potential buyer, as it will include the transfer of the entire pizza crust business, both facilities as well as the team members. However, Tyson Foods will continue to hold the tortilla production from these manufacturing facilities, with plans of using them in other parts of its business.Further, the company remains focused on aligning its growth efforts toward the profitable protein-rich arena. Markedly, rising demand for protein products have been one of the primary growth drivers for Tyson Foods for a while. This is evident from the fact that sales volumes across the company’s Beef, Chicken and Prepared Foods segments increased 4.5%, 7.3% and 11.6%, respectively, during the first quarter of fiscal 2018.Encouraged by the increasing consumer preference for meat and chicken products, Tyson Foods has long been undertaking measures to expand protein-packed brands and sustain the growth momentum in these segments. The company’s investments in Memphis Meats and Beyond Meat are the latest examples in this connection.In fact, Tyson Foods’ investment in Beyond Meat indicates the company’s efforts to venture into the meat substitutes market. Apart from this, the company has been steadily expanding fresh prepared foods offering, owing to consumers’ rising demand for natural fresh meat without any added hormones or antibiotics.The company also invested $84 million (in August 2017) and $300 million (in November 2017) to expand poultry production capacity in Tennessee. Such efforts, combined with the acquisition of AdvancePierre and Original Philly, indicate the company’s dedicated focus on augmenting protein-packed food products.Clearly, the Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company has been firing on all cylinders to exploit the rising protein demand, which has helped it rally 21.6% in a year, easily crushing the industry’s 13% growth. We believe that such dedicated efforts in this connection, as underscored by the aforementioned announcement, is likely to drive the stock further.Looking for More?

579,TSN,"The equity universe is rife with apprehensions regarding the possibility of a full-blown trade war between the United States and China. Though the hopes of conflict resolution propelled the benchmarks north on Monday, the final outcome of the scenario still remains indiscernible.In fact, China has taken an aggressive stance against Trump’s $60 billion tariff implementation. The strong retaliatory methods that China wants to adopt include levying $3 billion tariffs on fruits, nuts, pork and other agricultural products imported from the United States.The ripple effect of these signaled trade restrictions to the prime export market of agricultural products were evident from the anxieties among the American farmers.Amid such pressing concerns, we have spotted five U.S. agricultural stocks which are likely to remain safe investment bets going forward.Two Prime Economies at WarPresident Trump’s attempt to trim $100 billion trade discrepancy by ordering punitive tariffs on about $60 billion worth of Chinese imports to the United States elevated tensions last week. However, Beijing’s reciprocation of the act with a plan to target $3 billion U.S. imports on Mar 23, signals its intention to continue this uneasy trade warBoth the superpowers are not conceding ground over trade but at the same time making attempts to prevent the situation spiraling beyond reach.In fact, the U.S. administration has repeatedly implored for a more open Chinese economy for its businesses. In sync with this, China is asked to do away with its rules that force American companies to hand over treasured intellectual property in order to operate in the Chinese markets. Moreover, Beijing has also been requested to lower tariffs on U.S. automobiles, augment spending on U.S. semiconductor and widen U.S. access to Chinese financial sector.Nevertheless, Liu He, a trusted advisor to Chinese president, has criticized the U.S. allegations of Chinese intellectual property theft, noting that the country ""has the capability to safeguard its national interest.""Eventually, Trump might not get the desired dip in the annual trade deficit as Beijing is unlikely to make any such effort. Notably, it is doubtful that China will bring about changes in its intellectual property-based trade rule, as it is regarded as “a key element” for its economic development.U.S. Agriculture: Clear & Obvious TargetExports have altered the U.S. farm economy in the recent decades, as investments on massive livestock operations, high-yield seeds and more resourceful logistics has made American farmers the prime suppler of foodstuff globally.However, China is the biggest export market of U.S. agriculture products. Soybean shipments to China was more than a third of the aggregate U.S. yield in 2017. China is the largest meat consumer in the world and it imported nearly 309,000 metric tons of pork from the United States in 2017. Beijing is also regarded as the second-best export market for U.S. cotton after Vietnam.  American agriculture is one industry that stands to suffer the most in the ongoing U.S.-China trade war.Under the $3 billion proposed tariff plan, China would be imposing 15% tariff on 120 product-lines of U.S. imports valuing roughly $1 billion; counting products like wine, fruit, steep pipes, and ethanol. Moreover, a second group of eight categories worth $2 billion, including pork and recycled aluminum, would be liable to a 25% tariff.Lean-hog future prices had dipped over 4% on Friday on fears of 25% tariff over U.S. pork by China. News of fresh tariff program has spread anxiety across the U.S. farm belt. The U.S. Department of Agriculture predicts that its farm income this year will slide to the lowest level since 2006.Endurance Stocks Amid the Trade WarWe have zeroed in on five bullish U.S. agriculture stocks that are likely to withstand the volatile times.These companies have a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), recorded a positive average earnings surprise in the last four quarters and performed better than the industry over the last three months. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for these stocks has been revised upward for the current year over the last 60 days for 2018 and also showcases positive earnings per share (EPS) growth for 2019.Let's dig a little deep into these five hot picks to get a fair idea of their individual skill sets.The Andersons, Inc.

581,TSN,"The Procter & Gamble Company (PG  -  Free Report) or P&G’s board of directors declared a 4% hike in its quarterly cash dividend to 71.72 cents per share, in a bid to impress investors. The dividend will be paid on or after May 15, 2018 to shareholders of record as of Apr 20, 2018. The new figure will add up to an annual dividend of $2.8688 per share.This consumer goods giant has consistently increased its dividend and has been paying dividends for 128 years, ever since its incorporation in 1890. In fact, the latest increase marks P&G’s 62nd consecutive year of dividend hike that reflects the company’s commitment to add value to shareholders, reflecting its confidence in business growth.P&G is considered to be one of the dividend aristocrats in the S&P 500 Index, given its consistent increase in dividends each year in its span of operations of more than 100 years in business. This, along with a dividend yield of more than 3% (3.53% as of Apr 10, 2018) helped P&G to attain the position.P&G generates strong cash flow annually. The company generated operating cash flow of $7.3 billion in the first six months of fiscal 2018, compared with $6 billion a year ago. The company spent $1.9 billion as capital spending in fiscal 2018 so far. Thus, the company was left with a significant free cash flow of $5.4 billion versus $4.7 billion in the year-ago period. This allows management the opportunity to invest in product innovations, acquisitions and brand development, in addition to regularly paying dividends and repurchasing shares. In the first six months of fiscal 2018, the company returned $7.9 billion of cash to shareholders via $3.6 billion of dividend payments and $4.3 billion of common stock repurchase.P&G is known for strong brand recognition, diversified portfolio, impressive product development capabilities and marketing prowess, as well as strong cash flow productivity. The company remains focused on balanced growth through improved product, packaging and marketing initiatives, and productivity cost-savings plan.Additionally, growth from emerging markets like China and India is expected to make 2018 another strong year for P&G. For fiscal 2018, P&G expects earnings per share growth of 5-8%, a modest improvement from the prior expectation of 5-7% growth.Investors should keep in mind that P&G's shares have lost around 13.2% in the past year, comparing unfavorably with 3.5% decline of its industry. The 13.2% decline also compares unfavorably with the broader Consumer Staples sector’s decrease of 1.9%. Earnings estimates have remained stable for fiscal 2018 over the last 30 days.The recent dividend hike is expected to bolster investors’ confidence in the company’s financials, improve its market position against competitors and lend upside to the stock.  Zacks Rank and Key PicksP&G carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Some better-ranked stocks from the Zacks Consumer Staples sector are Tyson Foods, Inc. (TSN  -  Free Report), Church & Dwight Company, Inc.

582,TSN,"The tariff dispute, which has been playing spoilsport, has intensified with President Donald Trump’s latest rhetoric on a potential trade war with China. Trump is seeking a further tariff of $100 billion against China in addition to the already proposed $50 billion of tariffs on Chinese goods, targeting robotics, information technology, communication technology and aerospace.Earlier this week, Washington planned to slap a 25% tariff on 1,300 China-made products, which include a wide array of products including raw materials, construction machinery, agricultural equipment, electronics, medical devices and consumer goods. These goods belong to industries, such as aerospace and agricultural equipment, which were the key growth areas of China over the next seven years.The new taxes came a day after China hit back with likely 25% duties on 106 American goods including soybeans, corns, aircraft, and vehicles worth an estimated $50 billion, against Trump’s similar threat in response to alleged intellectual property theft. The second-largest economy has already imposed a duty on 128 American food products, including meat, fruit, pork, dried fruits, wine and aluminum scrap, worth $3 billion effective Apr 2, in retaliation against Trump’s severe tariff of 24% on steel and 10% on aluminum imports.The round of sanctions and retaliation could trigger a global trade war, hurting worldwide economy and corporate profits at big U.S. exporters. As such, several corners of the broad market and various industries are in distress. In particular, large-caps stocks, which derive most of their revenues outside the United States especially China, appear vulnerable. On the other hand, small caps, which provide true domestic exposure, should be safe and better plays in case the tit-for-tat situation turns into a full-blown trade war.So let’s pick a couple of stocks from industries on China’s hit list for a match up to see which one is in the line of fire and which is guarded well enough to survive the tariff onslaught.The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) versus Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC  -  Free Report)Boeing would be hit hard from the proposed Chinese tariff, as it is the top U.S. exporter to China and will buy about $1 trillion worth of its aircraft over the next 20 years. On the other hand, NOC would remain unscathed by the dispute. Boeing has shed 4.6% in a month while NOC has gained 4.4%. Both stocks have a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Deere & Co. (DE  -  Free Report) versus Hormel Foods Corporation (HRL  -  Free Report)Farming equipment maker Deere could be among the biggest losers as the proposed China tariff on agricultural products would reduce demand for the related machines while packaged food companies like Hormel could see a boost resulting from cheaper commodity prices, including soybeans and corns, on weak Chinese demand. Both stocks have a Zack Rank #2. Shares of DE are down 3.6% over the past month while HRL has climbed 6.8%.DowDuPont Inc (DWDP  -  Free Report) versus Archer Daniels Midland Company (ADM  -  Free Report)DowDuPont’s agriculture unit is expected to be hurt by price declines in soybeans. The stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). On the other hand, Archer Daniels Midland could benefit from reduced prices. American agricultural producers export about $20 billion worth of products to China each year. Of this, $14.6 billion comprises soybeans and the rest include cotton, wheat and corn. ADM has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. Caterpillar Inc. (CAT  -  Free Report) versus H&E Equipment Services Inc. (HEES  -  Free Report)Caterpillar is vulnerable to the trade dispute as it has heavy exposure to China. Meanwhile, H&E Equipment Services is a small-cap stock and does not do business in China. CAT has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), while HEES has a Zacks Rank #2. Both stocks were beaten down over the past month.General Motors (GM  -  Free Report)) versus Tesla (TSLA  -  Free Report)American automakers would be the worst hit from the proposed tariff and a potential trade war. In particular, China has been General Motors’ largest retail market for six consecutive years as the automaker sold four million vehicles in 2017 for the first time ever. Meanwhile, Tesla also seems to be the biggest loser as China has threatened more import tariff on electric cars. Out of the two, GM still seems attractive with a Zacks Rank #1, while Tesla has a Zacks Rank #4.Tyson Foods Inc. (TSN  -  Free Report): A Wild CardAs Tyson Foods is the world's largest processor and marketer of chicken, beef, and pork, it is likely to be impacted by China’s 25% tariff on pork and pork products. Notably, China is the third-largest consumer of U.S. pork and bought about $1.1 billion worth of pork products from the United States last year, according to the U.S. Meat Export Federation. However, a possible duty on soybean would reduce the price of the commodity due to large supplies and thereby result in reduced cost for meat companies like Tyson. As such, Tyson is both a beneficiary and a loser in this series of tariff attack. The stock has a Zacks Rank #1 and a top VGM Score of A.Bottom LineAll the buzz has resulted from the Trump administration, which is seeking to reduce the U.S. trade deficit with China by $100 billion. Last year, the United States had a record $375-billion trade deficit with China, while China reported a U.S. trade surplus of $276 billion.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers.

583,TSN,"Monday, May 7, 2018Crude oil prices crept up over $70 per barrel for the first time in the global market since late-2014, before a long-term slide in prices took many economies into tougher times, including a relatively short-term dip in U.S. equities during our near-decade-long bull run. This comes as most headline-grabbing companies have already reported results from calendar Q1 earnings season, and without a lot of economic data on the docket for the current week.Why investors may pay closer attention to the price of oil this week — aside from already present spikes in gasoline prices at the pump — is because the May 12 deadline for whether the U.S. remains of the accord with Iran passed during the Obama administration that lifts economic sanctions in exchange for Iran keeping dormant its nuclear weapons development. President Trump has been a big opponent of this deal, both as a candidate and as president. Even with visits to the White House by people like France’s President Macron to assuage Trump to keep the U.S. within the agreement, odds are — like with the Paris Climate Accord — that we are likely to be out by week’s end.It’s unclear what the immediate implications of this step would be, but that in itself is part of the problem: the stock market abhors uncertainty. In addition to higher oil prices — which may continue to spike as relations between the U.S. and Iran become more frayed — military tensions may increase as a result of this negated agreement, not just between the West and Middle East, but within the region itself. Hezbollah, formed initially in Iran, now wields influence in countries like Lebanon, which borders on Israel, the U.S.’s main ally in the region.This is not the arena in which to debate U.S. foreign policy, but it is worth noting that a collapse in the Iran accord is likely to increase geopolitical concerns for investors in the U.S. stock market. Crude oil prices are already seeing the affect of this to a point, but ramifications have the potential of reaching much further. It would thus be reasonable to see market participants taking a guarded approach to investing ahead of the deadline this Saturday and beyond.Ahead of Monday’s opening bell, Tyson Foods (TSN  -  Free Report) reported a fiscal Q2 2018 miss on both top and bottom lines: $1.27 per share versus $1.32 was nevertheless up 25.7% year over year. Quarterly sales of $9.78 billion was short of the $9.94 billion Zacks consensus estimate. Earnings guidance for full-year 2018 was in-line with Q2 earnings results, +$6.55-6.70, between 23-25% year over year). For more on TSN’s earnings, click here.Another food-producing major, SYSCO Corp. (SYY  -  Free Report) reported mixed results for its fiscal Q3 2018 — earnings of 67 cents per share beat consensus by 3 cents (and rose 43% year over year), while revenues narrowly missed expectations when they came in at $14.35 billion in the quarter. Even still, SYY shares are up marginally in today’s pre-market. For more on SYY’s earnings, click here.Mark VickerySenior EditorQuestions or comments about this article and/or its author?

However, TreeHouse Foods’ strategic efforts are yet to revive the company’s performance. That said, lets look closely at some of the headwinds plaguing this Zacks Rank # 5 (Strong Sell) company’s performance.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Divestitures & Weak Pricing TreeHouse Foods’ fourth-quarter 2017 results marked its third consecutive quarter of year-over-year decline in earnings and sales. While earnings bore the brunt of soft sales and margins, revenues were mainly marred by divestiture of SIF (Canned Soup and Infant Feeding) business — which led to reduced sales at Baked Goods and Meals segments. Incidentally, the divestiture of the SIF business dented the company’s revenues during the third quarter. In fact, soft sales trends compelled the company to announce the closure of its pretzels and cereals manufacturing facility in Visalia. The move is likely to further dent the performance of the company’s Baked Goods segment.  Further, intense industry competition has led to unfavorable pricing impacts in most of the company’s segments. Moreover, volume/mix affected the Meals category.Input Cost Surge Dents Margins To add to the disappointments, TreeHouse Foods’ performance has been bruised by higher freight and commodity costs, dragging its direct operating income (DOI) margin. During the fourth quarter, division DOI margin contracted 270 basis points year over year. Management expects input cost inflation to remain a headwind in 2018, wherein freight costs are also expected to be a major hurdle.Rough Road Ahead Unfortunately, management anticipates the aforementioned headwinds to linger, which is evident from its dismal first-quarter fiscal 2018 outlook. Earnings for the first quarter are expected in the range of 10-20 cents per share, which reflects a year-over-year decline due to soft sales volumes, operational inefficiencies and the unfavorable timing of elevated commodity and freight costs with respect to pricing.Although TreeHouse foods has been stringently working toward business restructuring and reducing costs to better align its business with the changing industry landscape, such efforts are yet to offset persisting challenges.5 Medical Stocks to Buy NowZacks names 5 companies poised to ride a medical breakthrough that is targeting cures for leukemia, AIDS, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, and other conditions.New products in this field are already generating substantial revenue and even more wondrous treatments are in the pipeline.

585,TSN,"Pinnacle Foods Inc. (PF  -  Free Report) is successfully expanding its retail market share, courtesy of its well-chalked acquisitions and business expansion endeavors. Also, the company is gaining from its operational efficiency initiatives which have been boosting savings. While these aspects have been benefiting the in-market performance of this renowned manufacturer and distributor of branded food products, underlying weaknesses in the Specialty segment and escalated costs stemming from logistics and packaging have been causing some worries lately. Let’s get a deeper insight regarding these aspects, impacting the company’s performance.Expansion Efforts Boost Retail Market PerformancePinnacle Foods in-market performance has continued to be impressive for a while, fueling its overall business performance. In fact, with fourth-quarter 2017 results, the company marked 15th straight quarter and sixth consecutive year of market share growth. Notably, during 2017, the company’s market share grew 0.5% while its composite retail consumption jumped 2.4% from 2016.Acquisitions have been one of the prime catalysts behind the company’s sturdy market share growth. In fact, during 2017, the company gained synergies of $16 million from the Boulder Brands acquisition. Further, management expects to benefit from the residual synergies associated with this acquisition in the forthcoming periods. Other than this, Pinnacle Foods’ acquisitions of Duncan Hines manufacturing business and Garden Protein have also yielded favorably. Incidentally, the Duncan Hines business gave quite a boost to Pinnacle Foods market share during the fourth quarter.In addition to strategic buyouts, Pinnacle Foods innovation efforts also added a number of iconic brands to its rich products line-up. Some noteworthy innovations in the past include new varieties of the Duncan Hines Decadent, Duncan Hines Perfect Size baking kits, Birds Eye product lines and Vlasic purely pickles. In fact, the company’s Birds Eye product lines have been gaining traction lately, impacting the company’s fourth-quarter performance positively.For 2018, Management plans to roll out new products under the Birds Eye brand and will also be expanding its Hungry-Man Handful line. Moreover, encouraged by the popularity of Perfect Size for 1, the company will launch a variety of products and strengthen the Duncan Hines product line. Management is also planning exciting innovations for its gardein and Evol brands.Productivity Initiatives Bode WellThe company has an operational excellence program in place, designed to generate annual productivity savings across the supply chain. On account of such efforts, combined with acquisition synergies and benefits from the network optimization program, the company expects productivity for 2018 to be 4-4.5% of costs of products sold. Pinnacle Foods is also pursuing other initiatives to boost gross margin, including improving its product mix through product innovation and low-margin SKU rationalization, increasing the effectiveness of trade promotional spending and realizing synergies from acquisitions. Based on these efforts, the company expects results to be stronger and anticipates gross margin improvement of 300-400 bps by 2020.  Final ThoughtsWe note that Pinnacle Foods has been struggling with underlying weaknesses in the Specialty segment and also escalating logistics and packaging expenses. In fact, lately, such headwinds have been denting the company’s share price performance, which has witnessed decline of 5.6% in the past three months, faring slightly better than the industry’s 7.9% fall.Nevertheless, Pinnacle Foods’ sustained efforts to boost market share and enhance efficiency are quite praiseworthy. We expect that such efforts will aid this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company to add new leaves to its growth story and also uplift investor’s confidence in the stock.Hungry for More Consumer Staples Stocks?

588,TSN,"Tyson Foods, Inc. (TSN  -  Free Report) responds to the rising consumer demand for chicken products by frequently undertaking initiatives to expand poultry production capacity. The company recently announced plans to develop a chicken production complex in the City of Humboldt, in western Tennessee.This facility development project is valued at approximately $300 million. Upon completion of this project in late 2019, it is expected to create approximately 1,500 local jobs. The facility will primarily be engaged in the production of pre-packaged trays of fresh chicken and along with a capacity to process 1.25 million birds per week.In August 2017, the company announced making investments of $84 million for the expansion of the Union City facility in Tennessee. Operations at the facility are also expected to create 300 new jobs.Tyson Foods has been operating quite successfully in Tennessee for the past many years and has been undertaking initiatives to improve poultry production in the region. The company currently has four operational facilities in the state, with around 5,000 workers.Rising Demand for Chicken & Protein-Packed Products Bodes Well Increasing consumer preference for chicken products is well reflected in the company’s fourth-quarter 2017 results. Sales from the Chicken segment improved 8% year over year to reach $3,035 million, while sales volume expanded 4.1%. The company’s ongoing capacity expansion initiatives in Tennessee are expected to further augment the Chicken segment’s performance in the upcoming quarters.Further, Tyson Foods’ Prepared Foods segment also benefits from increased consumer demand for protein-packed and fresh food offerings. Sales volume in the Prepared Foods segment increased 9.5% during the fourth quarter. The company frequently undertakes acquisitions to expand the Prepared Foods portfolio. We note that positive synergies from the buyout of AdvancePierre have been driving the segment for a while. Moreover, the company recently announced the buyout of Original Philly Holdings which is expected to enhance offerings in the Prepared Foods category.The company’s food product expansion endeavors are also in line with the USDA expectations. For fiscal 2018 the USDA expects overall domestic protein production (chicken, beef, pork and turkey) to increase roughly 3-4% year over year. Owing to such trends in the food industry, Tyson Foods has been divesting non-protein businesses and allocating resources toward more profitable segments in the areas of chicken and beef products as well as other fresh food offerings.  The company’s strategic initiatives have led to sturdy performance in its food segments. As a result, this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company’s share have returned 35.3% in the past six months, compared with the industry’s rally of 21.4%.Looking For More Consumer Staple Stocks?

589,TSN,"The Procter & Gamble Company (PG  -  Free Report) or P&G has been struggling to boost sales for the last few quarters. A soft consumer spending environment in the United States and slowing global market growth are pressing concerns for the company.Resultantly, P&G's shares have gained only 5% so far this year, underperforming the industry’s growth of 14.2%.Also, the trend in current-quarter and current-year earnings estimate revisions is not satisfactory as it has remained stable over the past 30 days. Nonetheless, this $65-billion conglomerate remains focused on balanced growth through improved product, packaging, and marketing initiatives and productivity cost-saving plan.Initiatives to Counter Slow Sales GrowthP&G’s sales have remained subdued in recent quarters with net sales increasing a meager 1% in its first quarter of fiscal 2018. Organic sales increased 1% in the quarter, softer than the last quarter’s 2% growth. The slower growth rate was due to the challenges thrown by a tough base period comparison and 40 basis points (bps) impact from recent targeted pricing actions in U.S. blades and razors and ongoing portfolio clean-up efforts. Natural disasters were a further 30 bps headwind in the quarter as well.Importantly, this 1% organic sales growth was driven by volume instead of pricing, which has been flat. P&G could not push its prices up and has seen some inflation in input costs. Hence, margins have been trending down a bit despite continued productivity gains.Global category growth was below 2.5% during the quarter, a modest deceleration from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, with much of this slowdown occurring in the United States. While developing market growth was around 5%, developed market growth was just 0.5%. Weakening global share reflects poor execution in key markets of the company’s business.Nevertheless, management has outlined priorities to accelerate top and bottom-line growth. Importantly, in order to boost its profit level, P&G is re-working its supply chain to lower cost, reduce inventory and improve customer service levels by closing down underperforming plants, setting up new multi-category facilities, localizing manufacturing, upgrading, automating and standardizing operations and employing smart automation and digitization. Currently, the company expects to generate up to an additional $10 billion of cost savings over the next five years (fiscal 2017-2021) in areas including supply chain and cost of goods sold, marketing and digitization and promotional spend effectiveness.P&G’s adjusted earnings in the last reported quarter increased 6% from the year-ago level aided by productivity cost savings. SG&A expenses, as a percentage of sales, improved 10 bps helped by productivity savings from overhead, agency fee and ad production costs.In addition to cost cutting, P&G is focused on initiatives to boost its top line. Management has focused its priorities behind its four largest categories: Baby Care, Fabric Care, Hair Care, and Grooming and its two largest markets: the United States and China.The latest acquisition of Native, a startup competitor that specializes in direct-to-consumer personal care products, speaks off the company’s efforts to reinvigorate investors’ confidence. Although the financial terms of the deal were not disclosed, it marks P&G's first buyout in eight years.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderP&G currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks from the same sector are Pilgrim's Pride Corporation (PPC  -  Free Report) and Tyson Foods, Inc.

590,TSN,"Tyson Foods, Inc. (TSN  -  Free Report) has been a preferred pick for investors lately. Shares of the company have surged 33.4% in the past six months, compared with the industry’s rally of 20%. Recently, this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock hit a new 52-week high of $78.03 during the trading session on Nov 17, eventually closing at $77.97.We note that the company has been gaining from impressive performance in the previous quartets. Notably, Tyson Foods’ earnings have outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimates in two out of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 6.03%. Sales also beat estimates in three out of the past four quarters.Let’s look deeper into aspects which have been driving the company’s impressive performance.Solid Q4 PerformanceTyson Foods recently posted fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results, wherein earnings and sales surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate and improved year on year. Results mainly benefitted from strong performance in all segments, with an increase of 3.2% in net volume. The performance of Beef and Chicken remained particularly sturdy owing to a rise in volume of 4.1% and 3.3%, respectively. The quarter also witnessed 7.2% growth in net average selling price. Rising Preference for Protein-Packed Food Propels Growth Of late, Tyson Foods has been divesting non-protein businesses and allocating resources toward more profitable segments which include chicken and beef products as well as other fresh food offerings. The performances of Chicken and Beef segments have been steadily improving owing to rising consumer demand for protein-packed food products. Such a trend is positively impacting volumes in the company’s Pork segment. For fiscal 2018, USDA expects overall domestic protein production (chicken, beef, pork and turkey) to increase roughly 3-4% year over year. This will enable Tyson Foods to sustain its robust performance.Acquisitions to Drive Prepared Food Segment Rising consumer preference for protein-packed and fresh food offerings have also propelled the performance of Prepared Foods segment. Tyson Foods has undertaken several acquisitions to augment the segment’s performance. In this respect, the acquisition of AdvancePierre has been driving the company’s top-line in the last few quarters. Moreover, Tyson Foods announced plans to add Original Philly Holdings to this segment, which specializes in raw and fully-cooked Philly-style sandwich steak and cheesesteak appetizers. The takeover is expected to expand Tyson Foods offerings.Positive Outlook Considering the company’s steady progress in all its food segments, management envisions earnings for fiscal 2018 to rise 7-10% from the prior year, to reach $5.70-$5.85 per share. Further, sales for fiscal 2018 are expected to increase 7%. The company has also initiated a Financial Fitness program to enhance cost savings and operating efficiency in the upcoming periods. The program is targeted to benefit the Prepared Foods and Chicken Segments performance in particular.Undoubtedly, Tyson Foods is well positioned in the food market with a robust portfolio of strong brands and continuing efforts to sustain its sturdy performance.Do Consumer Staple Stocks Interest You?

592,TSN,"Generally, the investment community believes that only risky securities could generate lucrative returns. The strategy seems meaningful when the market is bullish. But investors should also be ready to accept lackluster returns when the market turns bearish.With intense research, we have developed a strategy which clearly shows that less risky assets can also provide investors with impressive returns only when some parameters are considered.Meaning of BetaBeta measures the volatility or risks to a security relative to the market (we are considering the S&P 500 here). That is, beta measures the extent to which the price of a stock moves with respect to the market.If the beta is equal to 1 it means that the stock is as volatile as the market. So, a stock is relatively more volatile if it has beta greater than 1 and less volatile if beta is less than 1.For example, if the beta is 1.8 then the stock will witness 80% more movement than the market.  Hence, we can say that if the market goes up, the stock will outperform by 80%. Conversely, if the market plunges, the stock will lose much more value than the market.Building a Low-Risk PortfolioIn order to find stocks with lower-than-market volatility, we added beta between 0 and 0.6 as our main criterion for screening. However, we need to keep in mind that low beta is not the only metric to be considered for choosing stocks in a volatile market. Hence to reach the winning strategy, we have considered a few additional criteria.Percentage Change in Price in the last 4 Weeks: We considered those stocks that saw positive price movement over the last month.Average 20 Day Volume greater than or equal to 50,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stocks are easily tradable.Price greater than or equal to $5: They must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.Zacks Rank equal to 1: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks indicate that they will significantly outperform the broader U.S. equity market over the next one to three months.Here are five of the 15 stocks that fit the bill:Based in London, Michael Kors Holdings Limited (KORS  -  Free Report) is a global luxury lifestyle company, founded by designer Michael Kors. The company managed to surpass the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the prior four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 23.70%.

593,TSN,"Tyson Foods, Inc. (TSN  -  Free Report) has done exceedingly well and emerged as a strong contender to be an investment choice. This is quite evident from the stock’s surge of 30.5%, compared with the industry’s growth of 19.8%. We believe there is still momentum left in this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock, which is reflected in its VGM Score of A. Let’s delve deeper. Protein Packed Brands — A Bright SpotTyson Foods actively responds to consumers increasing preference for protein-packed meat and chicken products. Notably, sales volume in the chicken segment inched up 1.6% and 4.1% during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2017, respectively. Encouraged by such growth, the company has undertaken several efforts to expand poultry production capacity, especially in Tennessee. Along with the chicken segment, the company’s beef unit grew 0.4% and 3.3% in the past two quarters. Robust domestic demand for beef products, improved availability of cattle supply and higher exports have been the primary catalysts in this segment.Further, Tyson Foods has been focusing on acquisitions to strengthen protein-packed portfolio. In this regard, the company’s AdvancePierre buyout favorably impacted the Prepared Foods segment’s performance in the last two quarters. To enrich Prepared Foods category, the company also announced the buyout of Original Philly Holdings in November 2017. Management continues to expect positive synergies from these acquisitions.Robust Global Foothold & Product PortfolioTyson Foods has a significant presence in markets outside the United States. During fiscal 2017, the company sold its products in approximately 117 countries, with major sales from markets of Canada, Central America, China, the European Union, Japan, Mexico, Middle East, South Korea and Taiwan. Notably, fiscal 2017 sales to customers in foreign countries totaled $4.5 billion, of which $3.9 billion were related to export sales from the United States.Moving to its product portfolio, Tyson Foods offers a wide array of meat products and commands a strong presence in beef, pork, chicken as well as processed and fresh meat food products categories. This acts as a buffer to the company’s sales and margins — if one category fails, the others can aid recovery. Also, Tyson Foods continuously innovates and adds products to an already rich food line-up. For fiscal 2018, the company plans to test line-up of meal kits and add more products to Hillshire snacking.Valuation PerspectiveA brief glance at some valuation metrics seems to indicate that Tyson Foods has enough room to run in bourses.Tyson Foods with a price to sales ratio of 0.8 compared with that of industry’s 1.1 indicate that the stock has enough upside potential. The stock also looks attractive with respect to a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 13.7x compared with industry’s 14.6x. A more-or-less similar picture emerges when comparing EV/EBITDA ratios. Tyson Foods holds the edge here with an EV/EBITDA ratio of 10.1 lower than 11 for the industry.Other Stocks that Warrant a LookUnited Natural Foods, Inc. (UNFI  -  Free Report) delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 2.3% in the trailing four quarters. The Zacks Rank #2 company has a long-term earnings growth rate of 6.2%.

594,TSN,"Increasing revenues have been a big challenge for The Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report) for the last few quarters amid lower demand for carbonated soft drinks or CSD.The beverage giant is leaving no stone unturned to boost revenues. The company is working on strategic initiatives in order to make its portfolio a total beverage company. This is mostly via improved marketing and innovation, focus on driving revenues by improved price/mix, digital focus, and productivity initiatives toward driving margins. However, the top line needs to show sustained improvement.Meanwhile, the company’s shares have underperformed the industry it belongs to on a year-to-date basis. The stock has returned 9.7% compared with the industry’s gain of 13.3%.Innovations, Productivity Improvements and Cost-Saving Efforts Bode WellCoca-Cola’s total sales decreased 14% in the first nine months of 2017. In fact, the company’s total sales decreased 15% year over year in the third quarter, marking the 10th consecutive quarterly decline in revenues.Sales of the company’s carbonated beverages are suffering due to increasing health consciousness among consumers. Accordingly, Coca-Cola is trying to reinvigorate the category by providing increased marketing support through innovations and strong integrated campaigns. Coca-Cola is also pursuing investments in newer revenue platforms to boost long-term sales and profits.The recent approach in this field by Coca-Cola has been the launch of Coca-Cola Zero Sugar, replacing Coke Zero, in the United States in Aug 2017. Coke Zero Sugar globally grew high single digit in the third quarter.Again, Coca-Cola made an important addition to its portfolio beyond sparkling soft drinks with the acquisition of Topo Chico premium sparkling mineral water brand in the United States in the third quarter of 2017.Apart from these sales building strategies, Coca-Cola has been doing well to boost its profit level on the back of improved productivity and better market execution. Despite generating lower profits, the company’s earnings of 50 cents per share in the third quarter improved 2% year over year, helped by ongoing productivity efforts. Lower SG&A expense (down 20%), higher gross margin (up 170 basis points or bps), and higher operating margin (up 404 bps) helped it come up with better numbers.Moreover, the company is on track to achieve total annualized productivity saving target of approximately $3.8 billion by 2019 from the initiatives takes under this program since its beginning.Additionally, Coca-Cola had a nice dividend yield of 3.23% (as of Nov 29) that grew regularly. The company has increased its dividend for 55 consecutive years, including the 8%, 6% and 6% dividend hikes in 2015, 2016 and 2017, respectively. Share buybacks continue to be significant, as it helps companies increase earnings per share with a reduced share base.Coca-Cola currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Other Stocks to ConsiderA few better-ranked stocks in the Consumer Staples sector are Pilgrim's Pride Corporation (PPC  -  Free Report) and Tyson Foods, Inc.

The Consumer Staples sector is expected to record earnings growth of 7.3% and revenue increase of 3.9%.The Consumer Staples sector is currently placed at the bottom 6% (15 of 16) of all Zacks sectors. Well, the segment has been grappling with headwinds such as rising input costs as well as intense competition that has increased promotional spending. This, in turn, has created significant pricing pressure. Thanks to such deterrents, the sector has lost 10.4% in a year, against the S&P 500 index’s gain of 9.8%.Even amid such concerns, companies in the sector are trying to stay afloat through well-chalked innovations and other efforts to meet consumers’ changing tastes and preferences.

(TSN  -  Free Report), that is slated to report second-quarter fiscal 2018 results, has long been cheering on rising demand for protein-rich products. Such a trend has led to significant growth in the company’s Beef, Chicken and Prepared Foods segments. Further, management expects demand for protein to continue rising and is well placed to exploit opportunities in the space. The company’s investments in Memphis Meats and Beyond Meat are the latest examples in this connection. It has also been bolstering its poultry production capacity. Such efforts combined with the acquisition of AdvancePierre and Original Philly indicate the company’s dedicated focus on augmenting protein-packed food products. Further, Tyson Foods also strives to enhance savings and induce operating efficiency through its Financial Fitness Program. (Read more: Will Protein Demand Drive Tyson Foods' Q2 Earnings?)Driven by the aforementioned factors, the consensus mark for earnings in the to-be-reported quarter is currently pegged at $1.37, depicting a surge of 35.6% from the year-ago quarter’s figure. Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect net sales for the impeding quarter to be approximately $9,954 million, depicting a rise of almost 9.6% from the prior-year quarter’s tally.However, Tyson Foods has been struggling with increased labor and freight expenses. Such headwinds are expected to linger and hurt performance in the second quarter as well. We also note that Tyson Foods has a mixed record of earnings surprises over the trailing four quarters. Also, this time around, the company has an Earnings ESP of -2.88%. Although the company’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP, a negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.

Notably, local case volumes in this segment has been rising year over year for 15 consecutive quarters. Management expects a stronger second half, wherein it also anticipates favorable results in its International segment.To top it, we remain encouraged about Sysco’s focus on its strategy for 2020, as it gives out positive signals for the quarter to be reported as well. In this regard, the company is focused on enhancing assortments, making constant innovations, ensuring food safety and revitalizing brands. Further, to evolve with the changing consumer preferences, Sysco is committed toward investing in technology and enhancing e-commerce operations.Indeed, such well-spun strategies place Sysco well on the growth trajectory. That said, the consensus estimate for third-quarter earnings is pegged at 64 cents, which marks a solid 25.5% improvement from 51 cents recorded in the year-ago quarter. Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for overall sales is pegged at $14,382 million, up from $13,524 million recorded in the year-ago quarter.However, the company has been incurring lower gross margin in the past two quarters, mainly stemming from higher inbound freight costs and food-cost inflation. Persistent hurdles like these are a threat to Sysco’s performance. Further, our proven model doesn’t show that Sysco is likely to beat bottom-line estimates this quarter. Though Sysco has an Earnings ESP of +0.63%, the company currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

596,TSN,"Tyson Foods, Inc. (TSN  -  Free Report) is slated to report second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on May 7, before the opening bell. Rising demand for protein-rich products has been favoring Tyson Foods’ performance. Positive synergies from buyouts and cost-saving efforts have also been fueling the company’s growth.However, we note that Tyson Foods has a mixed record of earnings surprises over the trailing four quarters. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to the upcoming quarterly release.Factors Impacting Q2Rising demand for protein and meat products has been an aspect of cheer for Tyson Foods for a while. This is evident from the fact that sales volumes across the Beef, Chicken and Prepared Foods segments increased 4.5%, 7.3% and 11.6%, respectively, during the first quarter of fiscal 2018. Further, management expects demand for protein to continue to rise and is well placed to exploit opportunities in the space. For fiscal 2018, USDA expects overall domestic protein production (chicken, beef, pork and turkey) to rise roughly 3% year over year.Such a positive market scenario has driven Tyson Foods to make several investments and cater to consumers’ demand efficiently. The company’s investments in Memphis Meats and Beyond Meat are the latest examples. It has also been bolstering its poultry production capacity in Tennessee and other regions. Apart from this, the company has been steadily expanding fresh prepared foods offering, courtesy of consumers’ rising demand for natural fresh meat offerings without added hormones or antibiotics.Buyouts Add Strength to PortfolioTyson Foods’ prepared food segment is expected to benefit from the positive synergies of the AdvancePierre buyout. Through this acquisition, management has been trying to expand fresh food offerings along with bolstering protein brands portfolio. The acquisition led to a 2.4% and 9.5% rise in sales volume during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2017, respectively. In first-quarter fiscal 2018 sales volume jumped 11.6%. Further, the company expects incremental sales of approximately $1.1 billion from AdvancePierre in fiscal 2018. Also, the company is on track to integrate Original Philly Holdings (acquired in November 2017) within its Prepared Foods segment.Driven by such positives, analysts polled by Zacks expect sales across Beef, Chicken, Pork and Prepared Foods segments to rise 6%, 6.1%, 2% and 17.3%, respectively, in the yet-to-be-reported quarter. Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for net sales for the impeding quarter is expected at $9,954 million, depicting a rise of almost 9.6% from the prior-year quarter’s figure.Tyson Foods, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Tyson Foods, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Tyson Foods, Inc. QuoteEnhancing Operational EfficiencyToward the latter half of 2017, Tyson Foods announced a Financial Fitness Program, which is expected to enhance operating efficiency, reduce overheads and fuel the bottom line in the forthcoming periods. These efforts are expected to generate total savings of roughly $200 million in fiscal 2018, which bode well for the upcoming quarterly release. Notably, the company generated savings of nearly $37 million from this program in the first quarter, which boosted the bottom line.We expect that the aforementioned factors will significantly aid the company’s bottom-line performance during the second quarter. Evidently, the consensus mark for earnings for the to-be-reported quarter is currently pegged at $1.37, depicting a surge of 35.6% from the year-ago quarter’s figure. However, the projection has gone down by four cents over the last 30 days, perhaps due to the the apprehensions stemming from the recently raised tariff rates on pork by China. Escalating labor and freight expenses are also a hurdle for the company, which may impede the bottom line.Wrapping it up, lets take a look at the picture unveiled by the Zacks Model for the impending quarter.Zacks ModelOur proven model does not show that Tyson Foods is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

597,TSN,"Demand for everyday-use products created by operators in the Consumer Staples space doesn’t tend to fluctuate a lot, but it is nevertheless exposed to macroeconomic forces at the margins. As such, the outlook for this space perks up as the outlook for the U.S. and global economy improves.The outlook for the U.S. economy has been favorable for the last several years, with the recent tax legislation expected to add to the longevity of the current U.S. expansion cycle. In addition to the indirect benefits to Consumer Staples companies from the tax cuts, these companies also stand to benefit directly from the legislation, as reflected in the improving earnings outlook for many companies. That said, Consumer Staples operators tend to be global in their operations and as such don’t benefit to the same extent from U.S. tax law changes as the more domestic companies. With growth hard to come by for companies in this mature space, Consumer Staples players have to remain focused on squeezing more out of their operations and coming out with revenue-boosting initiatives, which mainly include efforts to keep pace with the changing consumer patterns.On that note, let’s delve deeper in some of the major growth-driving strategies of the space.Strengthening Product Portfolio via Strategic Alliances, Buyouts Consumer staples companies are regularly undertaking both domestic and international acquisitions to expand their product lines and gain access to new markets. Some of these are also forming partnerships, mostly with larger and better-known companies, to strengthen their distribution networks, diversify portfolios, expand their reach and enhance market positioning. Notably, leveraging each other’s efficiencies creates significant synergies for companies that go for M&A activities.Mergers of Tyson Foods (TSN  -  Free Report) with packaged meat producer The Hillshire Brands (in August 2014); tobacco giants Reynolds American and Lorillard (in June 2015); food giants Kraft Foods Group, Inc. KHC and H.J. Heinz Company (in July 2015) and consumer goods companies Newell Brands (NWL  -  Free Report) and Jarden (in 2016) were the most talked about deals. Belgium-based brewer Anheuser Busch InBev’s BUD buyout of SABMiller in October 2016 also created a buzz in the beverage industry. Apart from this, Molson Coors (TAP  -  Free Report) acquired SABMiller plc’s 58% stake in MillerCoors, which made the former the third-largest brewer in the world, after Anheuser-Busch InBev and Heineken.Cost Cutting and Restructuring InitiativesMost consumer staples companies are implementing cost-reduction initiatives to boost profits. In the latter half of 2017, Tyson Foods announced a Financial Fitness Program, with the objectives of enhancing operating efficiency, reducing overheads and fuelling bottom-line performance. Colgate CL has also been benefiting from its Global Growth and Efficiency Program, which focuses on reducing structural costs in order to improve gross and operating profit, standardizing processes to improve the decision-making procedure and enhance its market share worldwide.Additionally, Sysco’s (SYY  -  Free Report) core strategies for 2020 include plans to optimize business and achieving operational efficacy. We also commend Kimberly Clark’s KMB 2018 Global Restructuring & Focus on Reducing Costs Everywhere (FORCE) programs, which are expected to generate cost savings of more than $2 billion over the next four years. Companies like McCormick MKC, Coca-Cola KO, Molson Coors, Mondelez International MDLZ, Smucker (SJM  -  Free Report), Kellogg K and many others have also been benefiting from significant cost savings and restructuring initiatives to boost earnings.Focus on InnovationInnovation remains the guiding principle of consumer staples companies as it enables them to enhance brand appeal through product differentiation and capture market share across all regions and categories. Thus, companies put a lot of thrust on innovation to upgrade their brands and create differentiated value propositions. Notably, constant innovations supported by efficient marketing are essential for consumer staples companies to stay ahead of competition.As evidence, novelty has been a driving force for consumer product giants like The Procter & Gamble Co. (PG  -  Free Report) and Colgate-Palmolive, and cosmetic majors like Estee Lauder EL. These companies constantly come up with new products that suit changing consumer trends, to tap demand and boost revenues. Also, major food companies like Smucker and Campbell Soup CPB, alcohol stocks like Brown-Forman BF.B and Constellation Brands (STZ  -  Free Report), and even tobacco players like Altria (MO  -  Free Report) and Phillip Morris (PM  -  Free Report) have been adding new products to gain competitive edge and augment market share.Exiting Underperforming Units to Enhance OperationsApart from growing their businesses through buyouts, companies also remain focused on improving their product portfolios through divestitures. Offloading underperforming operations enables the companies to concentrate on the core and profitable areas.For example, as part of its strategic business review following its merger with Jarden, Newell Brands announced plans to sell nearly 10% of its current portfolio, including a major chunk of its Tools segment. This highlights the company’s focus on simplifying its operating structure, alongside highlighting its commitment toward making prudent investments in areas with higher growth potential. Similarly, Unilever (UL  -  Free Report) announced plans to sell its shrinking Spreads business to KKR (in December 2017) to shift concentration on fast-growing products.Adopting E-Commerce Mantra: The Need of the HourWith technology having advanced by leaps and bounds, online shopping has become the order of the day. Thanks to various mobile apps and dot.com business lines, shopping for anything is literally on consumers’ finger-tips. Consumers’ rapid shift to e-marketplace has compelled companies to adopt the e-commerce mantra. Companies like United Naturals (UNFI  -  Free Report), SUPERVALU (SVU  -  Free Report), Campbell Soup and Estee Lauder among others, are striving to enhance e-commerce space, through investments in technology and infrastructure.Driven by these efforts, United Natural Foods’ e-commerce sales jumped almost 28.9% in the second quarter. As for SUPERVALU, the company’s contract with Instacart, along with endeavors to upgrade website and mobile applications underscore its knack to enhance consumer shopping experiences.Transition to Health and Wellness ProductsAs consumer preference is the life blood of Consumer Staples, companies have to adapt to evolving trends to stay strong in the industry. A key trend over the last few years has been the desire for natural and organic products, prompting many players in the space to come out with health and wellness offerings. This is the case with almost all industries in the sector.Apart from this, tobacco companies like Altria and Reynolds American are also adapting to the evolving needs of consumers and have resorted to less harmful alternatives like electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes). To cater to changing consumer preference, Philip Morris launched the much talked about IQOS, a smokeless cigarette in November 2014, aiming to lead the tobacco industry’s push into reduced-risk products. IQOS is anticipated to boost market share and offset declining volumes in traditional cigarette business over the long term.Additionally, rising consumer awareness regarding the harmful impact of toxic chemicals has been driving the market share for organic personal care products too. Consequently, players like Unilever are making solid progress in the natural and organic products category. This is evident from its deal to buy Schmidt’s Naturals that specializes in personal care products such as deodorants, toothpaste and bar soaps. Clearly, these robust efforts are expected to boost the companies’ top line in the future.Clearly, the consumer staples space offers plenty of reasons to be optimistic about it over the long term.

598,TSN,"Tyson Foods, Inc. (TSN  -  Free Report) has been struggling lately, but the selling pressure may be coming to an end soon. That is because TSN recently saw a Hammer Chart Pattern which can signal that the stock is nearing a bottom.What is a Hammer Chart Pattern? A hammer chart pattern is a popular technical indicator that is used in candlestick charting. The hammer appears when a stock tumbles during the day, but then finds strength at some point in the session to close near or above its opening price. This forms a candlestick that resembles a hammer, and it can suggest that the market has found a low point in the stock, and that better days are ahead.Other FactorsPlus, earnings estimates have been rising for this company, even despite the sluggish trading lately. In just the past 60 days alone 2 estimates have gone higher, compared to none lower, while the consensus estimate has also moved in the right direction.Estimates have actually risen so much that the stock now has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) suggesting this relatively unloved stock could be due for a breakout soon.

599,TSN,"The Procter & Gamble Company (PG  -  Free Report), commonly known as P&G, entered into an agreement to acquire the consumer-health business of Germany-based Merck KGaA for approximately 3.4 billion euro ($4 billion). Per the terms, P&G will also acquire a 51.8% stake in India-listed Merck Ltd. The deal is expected to close during the 2018/19 fiscal year.Merck KGaA’s $1-billion consumer health business provides a wide range of over-the-counter (OTC) products for pain relieving products as well as for supporting physical activity and mobility. The business grew 6% over the past two years. The drug company is selling its consumer health business to focus more on its higher-margin pharmaceuticals business.Buyout BenefitsThe addition of Merck KGaA’s differentiated as well as physician-supported brands will enhance P&G's existing consumer health care capabilities and brands such as Vicks, Pepto-Bismol and Oral-B. It is expected to boost the company’s brand portfolio and category footprint.It will also expand P&G’s geographic footprint as Merck KGaA’s consumer health business is active in 44 countries and includes more than 900 products.P&G believes that the addition of Merck KGaA’s products will provide strong health care commercial and supply capabilities, deep technical mastery and proven consumer health care leadership.Termination of PGT JVImportantly, the acquisition of Merck KGaA’s consumer health business replaces P&G’s joint venture with Teva Pharmaceutical Industries — PGT Healthcare joint venture. This joint venture delivered disproportionate revenues and earnings growth and strengthened presence in more than 50 countries.After a recent review, Teva and P&G decided to terminate the venture as their priorities and strategies were no longer in sync.P&G's shares have lost around 11.4% in the last six months while its industry fell 4.5%. Earnings estimates for fiscal 2018 fell 0.2% over the last seven days. Nevertheless, the deal is expected to contribute at a time when the company is struggling with sluggish growth in global markets.  Zacks Rank and Key PicksP&G carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks from the Zacks Consumer Staples sector are Tyson Foods, Inc.

In fact, the company’s impressive past performance has also helped its shares gain 13.2% over the last six months, surpassing the industry’s 3.1% growth.Rising Demand for Protein-Rich Products Propels GrowthEscalated demand for protein products have been one of the primary growth drivers for Tyson Foods for a while. Notably, sales volumes across the company’s Beef, Chicken and Prepared Foods segments increased 4.5%, 7.3% and 11.6%, respectively, during the first quarter of fiscal 2018.In addition to higher demand, the Chicken and Prepared foods categories have been gaining from higher volumes, courtesy of the AdvancePierre buyout.

602,TSN,"Wall Street and the White House are jittery as repercussions related to fears of a trade war with China, possibilities of three or more rate hikes by the Fed this year, and tech stock concerns regarding data privacy and antitrust risks continue to do the rounds. However, the Chinese government’s retaliation to the Trump administration’s levy of 25% tariffs on 1,300 imported goods from China topped the headlines.China’s president, Xi Jinping, recently levied up to 25% tariffs on 106 U.S. imports, including soybeans, cars, chemicals and more. With this, both countries are targeting about $50 billion tariffs on imports from each other.Signs of a U.S.-China trade war further became prominent with Trump’s intention to strike another $100 billion in tariffs on Chinese goods. This has certainly sent shock waves across the entire global economy.The new tariffs framed by China's Ministry of Commerce are expected to hurt a host of U.S. industries, including consumer electronics, food, beverages, aircrafts and automobiles, among others. According to experts, the tariff is likely to be higher than anticipated, with the U.S. agricultural industry being the prime target.The tariffs will also affect meat-exporting companies, with the levy of 25% tariff on pork. Per sources, China is one of the largest markets for U.S. pork exports in terms of value and volume. Consequently, the hiked tariffs are expected to cause significant loss for China’s meat exporters and in turn, hurt their profitability.However, the effective date for the imposition of these tariffs has not been disclosed yet. While the United States stated that the tariffs will take effect after a public comment and consultation period lasting for about two months, China said that the imposition depends on Trump’s decision.Alleged intellectual property violations by Chinese companies led to a U.S. trade deficit of $504 billion with China, which sparked the trade conflict between the world’s two largest economies. To force changes in China’s intellectual properties practices, the Trump administration at first imposed a tariff of up to $60 billion on Chinese imports, particularly on steel and aluminum. In response, China retaliated by imposing tariffs worth about $3 billion on 128 American exports.Key U.S. Sectors at StakeAs is clear from the above discussion, the recently levied tariffs are likely to erode the profit margins of players in the Consumer Staples sector. This sector, which mainly comprises food, meat, beverages and agriculture stocks, is likely to be at risk after the imposition of the aforementioned tariffs.Generally, Consumer Staples stocks are considered most defensive, owing to their nature of fulfilling the basic necessities of daily lives. However, how these stocks will battle the current turmoil remains to be seen.Currently, Consumer Staples ranks among the top 50% of all Zacks sectors (8 of 16).Let’s take a closer look at some of the prominent players in Consumer Staples, highlighting their current position and ability to sail through the trade war scenario.Starting with Archer Daniels Midland Company (ADM  -  Free Report), this leading food processing company remains on track with the accomplishments related to operational excellence and readiness program. Further, management remains encouraged to deliver growth through cost-saving efforts, enhanced capabilities, product innovations and global strength. Notably, the company has corn processing facilities in China and entered a joint development agreement with the China-based Qingdao Vland Biotech Group Co., Ltd to develop new enzymes for animal feed applications.  This exposure may call for troubles for the company if the trade-war intensifies. Nevertheless, the Illinois-based company sports a Zacks Rank #1. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Tyson Foods, Inc. (TSN  -  Free Report), also a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company has been witnessing rising demand across the Beef, Chicken and prepared foods segments. Moreover, its Prepared Foods category has been delivering solid growth in particular, courtesy of rising demand for protein-packed brands and synergies from the AdvancePierre’ buyout. However, the company continues to incur higher wage and freight costs due to tightening market conditions. Also, raw materials price volatility remains a threat. Though the US-China conflict should have little impact on the company at present due to its modest exposure in China, the war may stall its chances to expand in the Chinese market.Hormel Foods Corporation (HRL  -  Free Report), the major manufacturer and marketer of various meat and food products in the United States and international markets, carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). The company believes that marketing programs and elevated demand for on-trend branded products will continue to boost its revenues in the quarters ahead. Moreover, its near-term results are anticipated to improve on the back of the recently made acquisitions. However, its Jennie-O Turkey Store segment remains soft owing to excess meat stock in cold storage and fall in turkey prices. The company has a strong business in China and operates through exports, joint venture and licensing partnerships. Further, Hormel Foods is enhancing its global footprint with higher capital investments in China, which might be at stake due to improved tariffs.Campbell Soup Company (CPB  -  Free Report) is progressing well with its cost savings plan. This is evident from the raised annualized savings target of $500 million. Also, the company remains keen on making acquisitions to enhance its brand portfolio and boost growth. The company’s recent buyout of Snyder’s-Lance is likely to aid Campbell in fortifying its snacking brands’ portfolio, thus making it a snacking leader. Moreover, the company’s Kelsen brand has been delivering solid performance in China, which might be hampered due to the proposed changes in tariffs. Nevertheless, Campbell carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Brown-Forman Corporation (BF.B  -  Free Report), the major producer and distributor of premium alcoholic beverages in the world, continues to gain from solid growth in underlying sales, persistent momentum at its focus categories and strength in Jack Daniels. This Zacks Rank #3 stock remains optimistic on growth at its premium American whiskey and tequila brands. Looking ahead, management sees higher growth potential in China as it accelerates investments in this area. However, any adverse changes to the US-China relations may stall the company’s aspirations to grow in the region.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

603,TSN,"After enduring the toughest start to the year in recent times, markets have started the second quarter on a sorry note. U.S. stocks have had their most disappointing start to April since 1929. And now trade war and tech stock related concerns are threatening to cause a deeper correction for the markets.Historically, however, April has been a good month for stock gains. Also, first-quarter earnings are likely to be strong, coming on the back of strong fourth numbers. A flurry of recent reports also suggests that the economy continues to be resilient.And it remains to be seen whether Trump follows up on all the warnings he has issued recently. Taking all these factors into consideration, picking large-cap stocks which promise considerable returns may be a good idea at this point.April Historically Strong for StocksGoing by historical data, April has traditionally been a productive month for U.S. stocks. Data from the Stock Trader’s Almanac for 2018 shows that the Dow has gained 1.9% on average during April since 1950. This means that April is the most profitable month for the Dow, going by average monthly returns.Other major indexes also fair well during April, per the Almanac. For both the small-cap heavy Russell 2000 and the S&P 500, April is the third-best month of the year. Both these indexes have increased 1.5% on the average every April since 1950. April is also the fourth-best month for the Nasdaq. The tech-heavy index has notched up a 1.4% average gain during the month, per historical data.Data from independent broker-dealer LPL Financial shows that gains in April have been particularly notable during the last few years. The S&P 500 has ended April with gains 90% of the time over the past 10 years. The index has notched up an average gain of 2.2% over this period. The success rate of 90% is the highest for any month during this period. Also, average monthly gains are the third highest, after March and July. Strong Economy, Q1 Earnings to Boost StocksThe U.S. economy had finished 2017 on a strong note, growing faster during the fourth quarter than earlier estimated. Business investment expanded during this period even as consumer spending hit a three-year high.The first economic reports for April indicate that the economy continues to be resilient. Though the ISM Manufacturing Index dipped slightly, the economy as a whole expanded for the 107th consecutive month. Construction spending also inched up in February.Meanwhile, the outlook for first-quarter earnings is particularly bright, coming on the back of strong results for the fourth quarter. As of Mar 23, total Q1 earnings for the S&P 500 index were expected to be up +15.9% from the same period last year on +7.3% higher revenues. This would follow +13.5% earnings growth on +8.5% revenue growth in the preceding period. (Read: Handicapping the Q1 Earnings Season)Our ChoicesStocks have recently been buffeted by the twin concerns of an impending trade war with China and losses for tech stocks. While losses for tech stocks are likely temporary, it remains to be seen whether Trump follows up on his warnings or opts for a compromise. Meanwhile, April remains a historically good month for stocks. Also, while the economy remains strong, prospects for first-quarter earnings remain encouraging.Given this backdrop, it seems prudent to bet on relatively stable alternatives which hold out the promise of considerable returns. Large-cap stocks are relatively safer bets. At the same time, it is important to consider only those which offer the promise of short-term benefits and the prospect of good long-term performance. However, picking winning stocks may be difficult.This is where our VGM Score comes in. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores. Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners. However, it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM score. We have narrowed down our search to the following stocks, each of which has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and a good VGM Score.

604,TSN,"China is avenging President Donald Trump’s tariffs worth $60 billion on steel, aluminum and other products by imposing import duties on as many as 128 U.S. items including agricultural products, pork and fruits. Undoubtedly, the tariffs imposed by China’s Ministry of Finance, effective Monday, heightened fears of an ensuing trade war.Trump’s tariffs, which were cheered by domestic steel and aluminum producers, were opposed by producers of finished products. Automakers, apparel and shoe manufacturers, which belong to this ilk, will be severely affected by the newly imposed import duties. And if this was not enough, China’s retaliatory tariffs on imports worth $3 billion will only make matters more difficult for a number of U.S. companies, whose revenues depend on bulk exports to China.Naturally, the only option left for these exporters is to cut down on production, which will definitely hurt their revenues unless if these looks for avenues to channelize their exports to other countries. However, it is too early to predict how U.S. exporters will survive the tariff war and think of alternate export routes.Trump Instigates Tariff WarIn late February, Trump raised fears of a trade war when he announced his plans of 25% and 10% tariffs on imported steel and aluminum, respectively. In March, the import duties were finally put into motion.The move, which Trump believes will help in rebuilding the domestic steel and aluminum industry that has been treated unfairly by other countries for decades, was cheered by U.S. steelmakers. It saw shares of major steel manufacturers like AK Steel Holding Corp (AKS  -  Free Report) U.S. Steel Corp X, Nucor Corporation NUE and Steel Dynamics Inc. (STLD  -  Free Report) surging immediately. Also, shares of aluminum producers Century Aluminum Company (CENX  -  Free Report) and Alcoa Corp. (AA  -  Free Report) increased.Manufacturing Blue Chips SufferHowever, the decision drew flak from other quarters that utilize a significant amount of imported steel. Shares of major automakers like General Motors Company (GM  -  Free Report) and Ford Motor Company (F  -  Free Report), heavy equipment makers such as Caterpillar Inc. (CAT  -  Free Report) United Technologies Corporation (UTX  -  Free Report) and airline manufacturer The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) witnessed a sharp decline. Specifically, shares of General Motors have declined 2.9% in the last months, while Boeing and United Technologies have decreased 4.9% and 3.2%, respectively.Following this, in March, Trump announced plans of slapping tariffs on about $60 billion worth of China imports following an investigation by his administration into the theft of intellectual property from U.S. companies operating in that country. The decision was once again vehemently opposed by retailers and apparel and shoemakers, who rely heavily on imports or have manufacturing units in China.Quite obviously, Trump’s target is China, as a number of U.S. trade partners like Canada, Mexico, Brazil and Argentina have been exempted from the tariffs. Given this scenario, China’s backlash was only a matter of time.China Tariffs to Affect U.S. ExportersChina finally raised import duties on 128 U.S. goods that include pork, aluminum scrap and other agricultural produces on Monday, thus escalating fears of a trade war. China increased tariffs by 25% on eight products that include pork and aluminum scrap, while a 15% import duty has been set for 120 products including apples and almonds. The affected U.S. goods, which include products like pork, wine, fresh fruits, steel pipes, modified ethanol and ginseng, had an import value of $3 billion in 2017.Naturally, this is going to have a negative impact on the bulk exporters of U.S. livestock and agricultural produce. U.S. farmers exported nearly $20 billion of goods to China in 2017. According to the U.S. Meat Export Federation, in 2017, China purchased about $1.1 billion of pork from the United States, making China the third-largest market for U.S. pork. It goes without saying that meat products companies like Hormel Foods Corporation (HRL  -  Free Report), Tyson Foods, Inc. (TSN  -  Free Report) and Sanderson Farms, Inc. (SAFM  -  Free Report), which exports huge quantities to China, will feel the pinch because of the new tariffs. Hormel Foods has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Moreover, per the Renewable Fuels Association, China was the third-largest importer of ethanol from the United States in 2016, accounting for almost 20% its total exports. The recent tariffs now put an additional 15% duty along with the existing 30% duty on denatured ethanol imports from the United States. This will only worsen the situation for U.S. exporters.  Also the U.S. apple industry, which exports around 2.5 million cartons of apples to China, is likely to face a major blow with the imposition of tariffs.Interestingly, the dragon has breathed fire on goods that are primarily produced in the U.S. heartlands primarily comprising mid and mid-west states, which had mainly voted for Trump in 2016.  This certainly will not make Trump loyals too happy.In ConclusionAlthough, it is too early to gauge the impact of China’s retaliatory tariffs on U.S. imports, it will certainly leave the huge cohort of exporters, which have so long been earning a chunk of their revenues from that country, feeling uneasy. Moreover,  Trump’s voters might be dissatisfied and complaining. The tariffs definitely have escalated fears of a trade war and exports needs to look for new options to survive this onslaught. Let’s see how they to channelize their exports to countries that have been exempted from tariffs.Can Hackers Put Money INTO Your Portfolio?Earlier this year, credit bureau Equifax announced a massive data breach affecting 2 out of every 3 Americans.

607,TSN,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Tyson Foods Inc. (TSN  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Tyson Foods has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 14, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 21.2x. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, Tyson Foods’ current PE level puts it above its midpoint over the past five years, with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the broader industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 14.3. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that Tyson Foods has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 12.6, which is tad higher than the current level. So it is fair to expect an increase in the company’s share price in the near term.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Tyson Foods has a P/S ratio of about 0.7. This is a bit lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.4x right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Tyson Foods currently has a Value Score of A, putting it into the top 20%  of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes Tyson Foods a solid choice for value investors.What About the Stock Overall?Though Tyson Foods might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of A and a Momentum Score of F. This gives TSN a Zacks VGM score — or its overarching fundamental grade — of A. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best. The current quarter has seen one estimate go lower in the past sixty days, while the full year estimate has seen one up and one down in the same time period.This has had just a small impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has decreased by 0.7% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has inched upper by 0.2%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Tyson Foods, Inc. Price and Consensus  Tyson Foods, Inc. Price and Consensus | Tyson Foods, Inc. QuoteThis somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and why we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineTyson Foods is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. However, with a sluggish industry rank (among Bottom 29% of more than 250 industries) and a Zacks Rank #3, it is hard to get too excited about this company overall. In fact, over the past two years, the broader industry has clearly underperformed the market at large, as you can see below:So, value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick.Zacks Top 10 Stocks for 2018In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest buy-and-hold tickers for the entirety of 2018?Last year's 2017 Zacks Top 10 Stocks portfolio produced double-digit winners, including FMC Corp. and VMware which racked up stellar gains of +67.9% and +61%.

608,TSN,"The battle for a seat on the board of The Procter & Gamble Company (PG  -  Free Report) or P&G may now be drawing to a close. Hedge fund billionaire Nelson Peltz seems to have won a seat, albeit narrowly, after a recounted tally of votes was released on Nov 15.Shares of the world’s largest consumer products maker by market value gained more than 3% in after-hours trading on Nov 15. The news might have cheered P&G investors, who support management reshuffle in the hope of financial improvement.  P&G revealed Peltz is leading Ernesto Zedillo by 0.0016%, or 42,780 shares, out of the company's nearly 2.7 billion in diluted shares outstanding. In a preliminary count disclosed last month, Peltz fell short of winning by 6.2 million votes, after losing by 0.3% of votes cast.However, yesterday’s updated vote count is also a preliminary one, and subject to review and a challenge period. The company, currently under CEO Taylor, is simplifying its operating structure to boost sales and profits.In contrast, Peltz’s Trian Fund Management wants to radically alter the company’s corporate structure. Trian argued that P&G should be simplified further into three standalone business units, namely grooming ($26 billion in annual sales), home care ($21 billion) and family care ($18 billion).Native BuyoutIn a separate business development, P&G announced the acquisition of Native, a startup competitor that specializes in direct-to-consumer personal care products. Although the financial terms of the deal were not disclosed, it marks P&G's first buyout in eight years.Bill Brace, P&G's vice president of North American Personal Care said in a statement that this addition will help P&G to expand its portfolio that already includes Secret, Old Spice and Gillette, to reach consumers avoiding ingredients like parabens and aluminum.Consumers have become extremely vigilant of the ingredients used in products. Native’s website proclaims its brand as ""deodorant that isn't a science experiment.”The purchase not only gives P&G another beauty brand in the field of natural ingredients, but also gives a solid foothold in digital sales. The Cincinnati-based consumer products giant said Native would appeal to consumers, who buy natural personal care items online and not in stores.Again, the acquisition could be an answer to Peltz, who in his quest for a seat on P&G's board, had earlier criticized the company for being slow in adapting to innovations and insisted on taking over small, on-trend companies. P&G, however, has largely focused on streamlining operations by divesting rather than acquiring in recent years.Share Price PerformanceP&G’s shares have gained 5% so far this year, comparing unfavorably with the growth of the industry it belongs to. Earnings estimates for the current year have remained unchanged over the last 30 days. Meanwhile, P&G has surpassed earnings estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company’s new product lineup, aggressive marketing, productivity improvement and cost-saving initiatives should boost its profits and thereby the stock’s performance in the upcoming quarters.Zacks Rank & Key PicksP&G currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks from the same sector are Pilgrim's Pride Corporation (PPC  -  Free Report) and Tyson Foods, Inc.’s (TSN  -  Free Report), sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), and Unilever PLC (UL  -  Free Report), with a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

610,TSN,"The re-emergence of trade war fears has sent tremors across the Wall Street. This is because China has targeted about $3 billion in American exports in retaliation against Donald Trump’s tariff on steel and aluminum import (read: Trump Tariffs Put These Sector ETFs & Stocks in Focus).The second-largest country has slapped a duty on 128 American food products effective Apr 2. Of these, 120 products, including dried fruits, sparkling wine and stainless steel pipes, saw a new tariff of 15% while eight commodities, including pork products and aluminum scrap, saw a 25% tax hike. The new tariffs went into effect on Apr 2.The move would hurt several American food producers and exporters. In particular, farmers and the pork industry have been on the forefront of damage, as American farmers shipped nearly $20 billion of goods to China in 2017. China is the third-largest consumer of U.S. pork and bought about $1.1 billion worth of pork products from the United States last year, according to the U.S. Meat Export Federation.The tariff would also severely impact the apple and wine industry. Washington growers exported nearly 1.8 million 40-pound boxes of apples to mainland China last year and another million to Hong Kong, according to data from the Washington State Tree Fruit Association. Meanwhile, China is one of the fastest growing wine markets in the world and is the sixth-biggest wine importer following France, Australia, Chile, Spain and Italy. U.S. wine exports to greater China (including the Chinese mainland and Hong Kong) were up 10% last year to $197 million. Notably, the value of U.S. wine exports (97% from California) to China has increased 450% in the past decade (read: China Had a Strong Start in 2018: ETFs to Buy).Per money.cnn.com, China makes up for 6% of American fruit exports, 5% of wine exports, 3% of nuts exports and 40% of all ginseng exports.Given this, we have highlighted several ETFs and stocks that are likely to be hit hard and are in focus in the weeks ahead:Tyson Foods Inc. (TSN  -  Free Report)Tyson Foods is the world's largest processor and marketer of chicken, beef, and pork, the second-largest food company in the Fortune 500 and a member of the S&P 500.

611,TSN,"Trump’s attempt to trim the $100-billion trade deficit with China has sent shock waves across the equity universe, landing the American heartland in murky waters.Beijing has taken an aggressive stance by slapping up to 25% tariffs over $3-billion U.S. imports in response to the recent steel and aluminum import duties announced by Trump on Mar 23.Either by chance or by design, China’s retaliatory tariffs target the specialty agricultural products grown by the rural communities that had backed Trump’s victory in the 2016 presidential elections.  Republican-supporting states like Iowa and Illinois, as well as the remaining nation’s bread basket will be in trouble soon if agricultural exports to the key overseas market tumble.  Trump stated that trade disputes are “good” and “easy to win”, while the consensus view of economists believe that “all parties lose”.The ripple effect of these trade restrictions might hit the U.S. agricultural business, as well as Trump’s supporting force in November mid-term elections.Beijing Hostile Over Political & Retaliatory CausesChina has often levied tariffs on nations for retaliatory and political interests.Last year, South Korea was targeted on account of Seoul’s choice to host the U.S. Terminal High Altitude Area Defense missile system, which Beijing deemed to be an insult. In sync with this, the South Korean economy downsized $6.8 billion, on grounds of a tourism boycott from China.Also, earlier in 2008, Beijing’s nationalists had urged a prohibition against the French supermarket chain — Carrefour Group — after Tibetan liberation supporters’ advocates objected the Olympic torch’s course through Paris.China had also barred banana imports from Philippines due to its territorial disagreements with the latter.Trump Heartland in Murky WatersAmerican trade supporters have cautioned that Beijing’s tit-for-tat tariffs will impact large volumes of U.S. agricultural exports grown in the heartland states which had voted for Trump.China has levied tariffs up to 25% on 128 American goods, majorly including luxury agricultural products such as nuts, dried fruits and ginseng. Other products like pork, scrap aluminum and specialized steel products have also been included in this list.A 25% charge over pork will heavily weigh over Iowa, producing nearly one-third of the aggregate U.S. pork. This mid-western American state had witnessed strong backing for Republicans in 2016.Furthermore, almond, nuts, and other dry fruits hit by the tariffs imposed by China are the staple products of California’s Central Valley. Despite California supporting Democrats, farmers of Central Valley had voted for Trump.  The U.S. Department of Agriculture predicts that its farm income this year will slide to the lowest level, since 2006.Now, it remains to be seen if this downtrend will also impact the President’s support for the upcoming mid-term elections this November.American Food Industry at StakeAmerican agriculture is one industry that stands to suffer the most in the ongoing U.S.-China trade war.Exports have altered the U.S. farm economy in recent decades, as investments on massive livestock operations, high-yield seeds and more resourceful logistics have made American farmers the prime supplier of food stuff globally.Nevertheless, China is the biggest export market of U.S. agriculture products. Soybean shipments to the nation accounted for more than a third of the aggregate U.S. yield in 2017. This East Asian nation is the largest meat consumer in the world and imported nearly 309,000 metric tons of pork from the United States last year. Beijing is also regarded as the second-best export market for U.S. cotton, after Vietnam.  However, now it is feared that the recently-levied $3-billion tariffs will drag down revenues and profitability of the U.S. agricultural companies.  Notably, per media reports, domestic demand for meat-based products has been gradually declining in the United States. At this stage, trade restrictions in the prime overseas market will possibly become the biggest setback for the American meat-product companies.Stocks in Focus  We have zeroed in on four U.S. agricultural stocks that investors might want to recall in their watch list. These stocks currently carry a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), #2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold), and have performed better than the Zacks Consumer Staples sector over the past  year.These stocks seem to be promising investment bets at the moment. However, widespread concern regarding the probable impact of Beijing’s tariff program evokes apprehension toward these choices.  Let's delve deeper to have a fair idea of the stocks’ individual skill sets.Industrias Bachoco, S.A.B. de C.V.

(SAFM  -  Free Report) produces, processes and sells frozen, fresh and prepared chicken products. The stock, which currently carries a Zacks Rank #3, has appreciated 13.7%, as against the 1.2% loss incurred by the sector in a year.The company is poised to boost near-term profits on the back of increased market prices for dark meat products, increased productivity and stronger corn, as well as soybean exports in overseas markets like Argentina. However, slump in white meat prices and a supply glut might dent bottom-line results.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of All                 Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

617,TSN,"Tyson Foods, Inc. (TSN  -  Free Report) is slated to report first-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Feb 8, before the opening bell.The question lingering in investors’ minds is, whether this major food company will be able to pull off a positive earnings surprise in the to-be-reported quarter. The company’s earnings have outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 6%.Let’s now take a look at how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors Likely to Influence This QuarterTyson Foods has been benefiting from its strategic buyouts, focus on protein-packed brands and nutritious products as well as significant geographical foothold. Impressively, the company witnessed major sales from the markets of Canada, Central America, China, the European Union, Japan, Mexico, Middle East, South Korea and Taiwan. Also, the company’s focus on strengthening protein-packed brands portfolio is noteworthy. This is apparent from the recent investment in the food-tech startup, Memphis Meats, which is anticipated to expand Tyson Foods’ protein-rich offerings.Last quarter, management announced a Financial Fitness Program that is expected to enhance operating efficiency in the forthcoming periods. In fiscal 2018, the company plans to test line-up of meal kits and add more products to Hillshire snacking. All these initiatives are likely to drive growth in the first quarter.As a result, Tyson Foods’ shares have gained 18% in a year, rallying ahead of the industry’s growth of 13.7%.Meanwhile, we expect Tyson Foods to continue gaining from rise in demand at the chicken and the beef segments. Also, the company’s prepared foods category has been depicting solid growth owing to rising demand for protein-packed brands and synergies from the AdvancePierre’s buyout. Encouragingly, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales at the chicken and the beef segments are currently pegged at $2,876 million and $3,671 million, respectively, up 6.3% and 4.1% year over year. Further, the consensus estimate for sales of $2,109 million from the prepared foods division is likely to witness growth of 11.3%. Similarly, the sales estimate of $1,284 million for the company’s Pork segment also depicts an improvement of 2.6% from the prior-year quarter.These estimates have aided the consensus estimate for the company’s total sales to witness an increase of 7.7% year over year, which is pegged at $9,892 million. However, the company’s earnings estimate of $1.51 for the fiscal first quarter has decreased by a penny in the last 30 days, alongside depicting a year-over-year decline of roughly 5% from the year-ago period. This might be due to the company’s exposure to the risk of raw material price volatility. Also, stiff competition and intense promotions remain headwinds. Rising wage costs also pose threats to Tyson Foods’ operating results.What Does The Zacks Model Unveil?Our proven model does not show that Tyson Foods is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. A stock needs to have both — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Tyson Foods, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Tyson Foods, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Tyson Foods, Inc. QuoteTyson Foods has an Earnings ESP of -0.17%. Although, the company’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP but a negative ESP makes our surprise prediction difficult.Stocks With Favorable CombinationsHere are some companies which, according to our model, have the right combination of elements to deliver earnings beat.United Natural Foods, Inc.

618,TSN,"Tyson Foods, Inc. (TSN  -  Free Report) has been a favored pick for investors in 2017. The food giant, specializing in fresh, frozen and processed meat and chicken products, has witnessed shares soar almost 32.6% this year, compared with its industry’s rally of 26.6%.Tyson Foods’ strategies have been paying off and driving business growth. Let us take a look at some of the initiatives undertaken by the company and see how it is placed for the upcoming periods.Protein Packed Brands: An Important Growth DriverTyson Foods actively responds to consumers increasing preference for protein-packed meat and chicken products. Notably, sales volume in the chicken segment inched up 1.6% and 4.1% during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2017, respectively. Encouraged by such growth, the company has undertaken several efforts to expand poultry production capacity, especially in Tennessee. Along with the chicken segment, the company’s beef unit grew 0.4% and 3.3% in the past two quarters. Robust domestic demand for beef products, improved availability of cattle supply and higher exports have been the primary drivers in this segment. Further, Tyson Foods has been focusing on acquisitions to strengthen protein-packed portfolio. In this regard, the company’s AdvancePierre buyout favorably impacted the Prepared Foods segment’s performance in the last two quarters. To enrich Prepared Foods category, the company also announced the buyout of Original Philly Holdings in November 2017. Management continues to expect positive synergies from these acquisitions.Latest Venture Into Meat Substitute MarketGrowing demand for protein-rich products has led to intensive animal farming, causing significant environmental and animal welfare concerns. Moreover, plant-sourced protein products are considered healthy and a viable substitute of meat by a growing demography of protein-savvy consumers.  Driven by such trends, Tyson Foods has been tapping into alternative sources of protein. The company recently raised its stake in the California-based company, Beyond Meat, which specializes in plant-based burger patties, non-GMO soy, heat-and-eat meals and pea protein frozen foods. Owned by the leading cereal producer Kellogg (K  -  Free Report), Beyond Meat has a wide market reach in the meat substitute market. Such initiatives strengthen Tyson Foods competitive position against firms which have substantial presence in the meat substitutes markets, such as Amazon.com (AMZN  -  Free Report) and Kroger (KR  -  Free Report).Lingering Concerns for Tyson FoodsTyson Foods has been consistently hiking wages to ensure greater employee retention. However, such endeavors increase the company’s expense burden. Moreover, Tyson Foods’ capacity expansion initiatives require the recruitment of more workers. This may further augment the company’s cost burden. Additionally, the company is exposed to the risks of volatility in the prices of raw materials, which may lead to unfavorable volume/mix. Such headwinds are expected to pose viable challenges for Tyson Foods, if not aptly offset.  Final ThoughtsTyson Foods expects its performance in fiscal 2018 to gain from business integration synergies and other cost-optimization efforts, such as the recently-introduced Financial Fitness Program. In fact, management expects net saving of nearly $200 million in fiscal 2018 along with synergies worth $400 million and $600 million estimated for fiscal 2019 and 2020, respectively. Such efforts are expected to offset the negative impacts of the expense burden and price volatility.Moreover, Tyson Foods’ robust portfolio of brands makes it a strong contender in the food industry.  Further, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s expansion efforts are expected to drive growth in the forthcoming periods and boost investor’s optimism.  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

620,TSN,"Tyson Foods, Inc. (TSN  -  Free Report) recently announced that it will invest $84 million in its poultry plant located at Union City, TN. The investment will expand the plant’s capacity and is anticipated to create more than 300 jobs.

Tyson Foods expects that the expansion plan would require building 200 additional broiler chicken houses within the forthcoming two years. The company also intends to collaborate with independent farmers in the northwestern Tennessee region.The expansion of the Union City plant in Tennessee is well in line with the company’s growth initiatives to expand its protein segments, especially chicken. Consumer demand for protein enriched food has been rising, which is well reflected in the company’s third-quarter fiscal 2017 results, where Tyson Foods witnessed strong volumes and solid performance of its chicken, beef and pork segments.Further, the company’s acquisition of AdvancePierre in the third quarter is also expected to drive growth of its protein packed brands. The acquisition is projected to generate cost synergies of $200 million within three years and also to be accretive to earnings.

621,TSN,"We issued an updated research report on premium meat products company, Hormel Foods Corporation (HRL  -  Free Report) on Aug 14.Inside StoryHormel Foods’ top- and bottom-line results in second-quarter fiscal 2017 (ended Apr 30, 2017) were largely hurt due to challenges faced by the Jennie-O Turkey Store business segment. Fall in turkey prices, extensive competition and elevation in overall operating expenses have been weighing over this segment's results.Hormel Foods noted that turkey prices (especially turkey breast meat) went down during the fiscal second quarter. The turkey market has been facing an oversupply situation and is unlikely to witness any price hike in the upcoming quarters.On the other hand, operating cost of the Jennie-O Turkey Store segment has been escalating due to poor yield accrued from certain plant operations and maintenance required for certain bio-security measures.In addition, Hormel Foods conducts its business in a highly competitive market. Pilgrim's Pride Corporation (PPC  -  Free Report), Tyson Foods, Inc. (TSN  -  Free Report) and Sanderson Farms, Inc. (SAFM  -  Free Report) are some major business players of the industry. Intense competition has been putting price pressure on Jennie-O Turkey Store business’ food service, retail, as well as daily business chains.Hormel Foods expects the aforementioned headwinds to depress its overall fiscal 2017 performance. Notably, the company currently estimates to report earnings at the lower end of the $1.65–$1.71 per share range for fiscal 2017.Furthermore, we believe that a stronger U.S. dollar might dent Hormel Foods’ international revenues and margins, moving ahead. Moreover, prices of various raw materials used by the company, such as beef, pork and poultry, are exposed to market fluctuations due to supply-demand inconsistencies.Additionally, outbreak of livestock diseases is expected to give rise to sudden supply-chain challenges for the company in the near term.Zacks' 10-Minute Stock-Picking SecretSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year. With compounding, rebalancing, and exclusive of fees, it can turn thousands into millions of dollars.But here's something even more remarkable: You can master this proven system without going to a single class or seminar.

622,TSN,"The investment world believes in the idea that for getting lucrative returns, investments in risky securities are essential. The idea works well when the market is bullish but the converse scenario should also be taken into account.Following intense research, we have developed a strategy that low-risk stocks could also lead to handsome returns if some other specific criteria are considered.Meaning of Beta Beta measures the volatility or risks to a security relative to the market (we are considering the S&P 500 here). That is, beta measures the extent to which the price of a stock moves with respect to the market.If the beta is equal to 1 it means that the stock is as volatile as the market. So, a stock is relatively more volatile if it has beta greater than 1 and less volatile if beta is less than 1.For example, if the beta is 1.8 then the stock will witness 80% more movement than the market.  Hence, we can say that if the market goes up, the stock will outperform by 80%. Conversely, if the market plunges, the stock will lose much more value than the market.The Winning StrategyIn order to find stocks with lower-than-market volatility, we added beta between 0 and 0.6 as our main criterion for screening. However, we need to keep in mind that low beta is not the only metric to be considered for choosing stocks in a volatile market. Hence to reach the winning strategy, we have considered a few additional criteria.Percentage Change in Price in the last 4 Weeks: We considered those stocks that saw positive price movement over the last month.Average 20 Day Volume greater than or equal to 50,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stocks are easily tradable.Price greater than or equal to $5: They must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.Zacks Rank equal to 1: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks indicate that they will significantly outperform the broader U.S. equity market over the next one to three months.Here are five of the 15 stocks that fit the bill:Operations of Pilgrim's Pride Corporation (PPC  -  Free Report) — headquartered in Greeley, CO — include production and distribution of frozen chicken products in the United States. For 2017, we are expecting the company to witness year-over-year earnings improvement of more than 38%. Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of earnings for 2017 has been revised upward over the last 30 days.Headquartered in Springdale, AR, Tyson Foods Inc. (TSN  -  Free Report) is the biggest U.S. company that produces, distributes and markets chicken, beef, pork as well as prepared foods. For the fiscal year ended September 2017, the company’s earnings will likely grow almost 16%. On top of that, over the past 30 days, Tyson Foods’ full-year earnings estimates have been revised upward.Central Garden & Pet Company (CENT  -  Free Report) — based in Walnut Creek, CA — is a leading producer and marketer of premium and value-oriented products focused toward the lawn & garden and pet supplies markets in the United States. The company managed to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings over the last four quarters with an average positive surprise of 122.17%. Also, for the fiscal year ended September 2017, Central Garden’s earnings are expected to grow almost 20%.Headquartered in Beijing TAL Education Group (TAL  -  Free Report) is the provider of services related to tutoring for students in the People's Republic of China. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings for fiscal year ended February 2018 has been revised upward over the past 30 days.

623,TSN,"Tyson Foods, Inc. (TSN  -  Free Report) has been depicting strong growth backed by higher demand for chicken, beef and pork as well as acquisition related synergies. The company recently reported third-quarter fiscal 2017 results, wherein it witnessed strong volume growth in most of its segments. The growth came on the back of increased demand for protein rich food products.We observe that Tyson Foods’ shares have outpaced the broader Consumer Staples sector in the past three months. Shares of the company increased 11.1% compared with the sector’s decline of 0.8%.Let’s now delve deeper into the aspects that have been aiding the company’s performance of late.Increased Demand Aids Growth Both earnings and revenues increased year over year during the third quarter of fiscal 2017. The increase was driven by the solid performance of its segments, primarily Beef, Pork and Chicken, owing to rising demand of these products. Notably, the Beef segment was seen to be sluggish in the past. Nevertheless, robust domestic demand for beef products, improved availability of cattle supply and higher exports aided the segment’s growth during the third quarter. Increased level of exports also benefited Beef and Pork segments during the quarter. For fiscal 2018, the USDA expects overall domestic protein production (chicken, beef, pork and turkey) to increase. Acquisitions & Expansion Yields Positive Results   Tyson Foods has been focusing on acquisitions to expand its portfolio. During the third quarter of 2017, it completed the acquisition of AdvancePierre for approximately $4.2 billion. Integration of this newly acquired business is on track. Tyson Foods expects the transaction to generate net synergies of approximately $200 million within the next three years. The acquisition also indicates the company’s focus on expanding its protein-packed brands and its fresh prepared foods offering. Tyson Foods’ Hillshire acquisition (completed in fiscal 2014) resulted in synergies of $580 million in fiscal 2016 and anticipates synergies of $675 million for fiscal 2017. This acquisition has boosted the company’s consumer products portfolio with the addition of strong brand names and provided an avenue for it to sell pork products in higher-margin end markets. Further, the company’s acquisition of Mexican food restaurant chains, Circle Foods and Don Julio Foods, in fiscal 2013 shows its commitment to diversify its product line up.Recently, Tyson Foods had announced that it will invest $84 million in its poultry plant located at Union City, TN. The investment will expand the plant’s capacity and is anticipated to create more than 300 jobs. The expansion of the facility is expected to begin in the fall and be completed by mid-2019.Continued Innovation Tyson Foods continuously innovates and adds products to an already rich food line up. As an increasing number of health-conscious U.S. consumers are focusing on nutritious breakfasts, the company considers it a high-potential category. Recent launches like Jimmy Dean Frittatas and Stuffed Hash Browns, Tyson Food Service Fully Cooked Drumsticks and Buffalo Chicken Crispitos are getting good response from consumers.Bottom Line Efforts taken by Tyson Foods to expand its network and capacity have increased the company’s cost structure, thereby creating pressure upon margins. The company has also been incurring higher wages, further raising its expense burden. Nevertheless, its acquisitions and innovation efforts have been yielding positive results, and are expected to aid the company to further raise its sales volumes and thereby overcome its current challenges.Moreover, Tyson Foods currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and has a VGM Score of A, indicating its inherent strength. Such factors make the stock highly favorable amongst investors.Looking For More Consumer Staples Stocks? Check TheseInvestors may also consider stocks such as Constellation Brands, Inc. (STZ  -  Free Report), Nu Skin Enterprises, Inc. (NUS  -  Free Report) and Inter Parfums, Inc. (IPAR  -  Free Report), all carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

624,TSN,"International Business Machines Corp. (IBM  -  Free Report) has taken another major step to strengthen its foothold in the blockchain market. The company recently announced a major blockchain collaboration with a consortium of food suppliers including Dole, Driscoll’s, Golden State Foods, Kroger (KR  -  Free Report), McCormick, McLane, Nestlé, Tyson Foods (TSN  -  Free Report), Unilever and Wal-mart (WMT  -  Free Report).The setup is aimed at providing unaltered information to all members of the food supply ecosystem regarding the origin and the state of the food. This is anticipated to help members of the ecosystem quickly identify contaminated food products and their sources, thereby enabling the removal of products from store shelves faster and lowering the spread of illness due to food contamination.The consortium along with IBM will work together for the betterment of blockchain applications in the global food supply industry. Apart from consumer non-durables industry, blockchain technology is also finding takers in the finance, education, insurance and medical services industry.We believe IBM’s blockchain initiatives coupled with the rapid adoption of the company’s artificial intelligence (AI) platform Watson will help the stock perform better. IBM has lost 12.6% of its value year to date compared with 11.5% loss of its industry.Blockchain Technology and Its ApplicationsAlex Tapscott, co-author of the book Blockchain Revolution, compares it to the emergence of internet in 1993. He explains the entire system as “a vast, globally distributed ledger where anyone, anywhere can move, store and manage any kind of asset, from money and securities to intellectual property and votes”.Blockchain is a kind of a distributed database and works as an online ledger that cannot be altered or breached easily. Each block of information has its own timestamp and a link to an earlier block in the chain, which enables all the parties to have easy access to information via a secure network. Originally used for cryptocurrency transactions, the system is transparent and incorruptible.International Business Machines Corporation Revenue (TTM) International Business Machines Corporation Revenue (TTM) | International Business Machines Corporation QuoteWal-mart, which is also a member of the consortium, has been working with IBM since October for the purpose of tracking food movement. Per Reuters, in June, Wal-mart had stated that blockchain trials helped the company to cut down the tracing time of mango shipments from seven days to 2.2 seconds.We believe the emergence of this technology as an integrated enterprise level platform for the food supply chain will enhance the concept of food safety and traceability. This in turn will form a strong supply chain, with lower instances of monetary losses due to faster action in case of discrepancies.Zacks RankIBM currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

625,TSN,"Hillenbrand, Inc. (HI  -  Free Report) is slated to report fourth quarter and fiscal 2017 results on Nov 15, after the closing bell. We expect the company’s results to gain from the flourishing Process Equipment business. However, headwinds in the Batesville unit and negative impact of adverse currency translation are expected to mar the company’s performance this season.The company’s earnings have surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the preceding five quarters, with an average beat of 10.6% in the trailing four quarters.Let’s take a look at some of the factors that are likely to impact Hillenbrand’s upcoming results.What to Expect? The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth quarter and fiscal 2017 has been stable in the past 30 days at 60 cents and $2.08 per share, respectively. Estimates for the fourth quarter are within management’s guided range of $2-$2.10. Notably, the consensus mark for the fourth quarter and the fiscal depicts year-over-year increase of more than 3%.Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect net revenues of $426.5 million for the fourth quarter, which reflects a 0.5% dip from the year-ago quarter. However, the consensus estimate for fiscal 2017 sales is pegged at $1.57 billion, which represents a 1.9% improvement from last year.Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise |  QuoteFactors Impacting the QuarterHillenbrand’s Process Equipment business segment appears impressive on the back of higher demand for screening and separating equipments as well as plastics projects. The company has been focusing on capitalizing the opportunities provided by the process equipments market. Also, the acquisition of Coperion has aided Hillenbrand’s pricing and productivity initiatives in this segment. Driven by such upsides, the company expects the process equipments business to flourish and deliver favorable results in the fourth quarter and fiscal 2017 results.However, Hillenbrand has been struggling with its Batesville business segment for quite some time, due to lower burial volumes in North America, as consumers depict a radical shift toward cremation. Moreover, the performance of this segment remains challenged with higher commodity and fuel costs as well as lower promotional activity. Hillenbrand expects these hurdles to continue hurting the performance of the Batesville business. Additionally, Hillenbrand expects currency headwinds to persist and drag the top-line performance in the fourth quarter.Nevertheless, the company has been planning to improve working capital structure, through cost reduction and restructuring of operations. These efforts are likely to aid the bottom-line performance in the fourth quarter.What Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Hillenbrand is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP for this to happen. You may uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Hillenbrand carries a Zacks Rank #3. However, it’s Earnings ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.Stocks With Favorable CombinationsHere are some companies which, according to our model, have the right combination of elements to deliver earnings beat.Energizer Holdings Inc (ENR  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +6.31% and a Zacks Rank #2.

626,TSN,"With a major chunk of the earnings releases behind us, the quarter seems to have fared quite well so far. While the number of overall positive surprises has been greater than previous periods, the revenue picture has been particularly impressive – in regard to both year-over-year growth as well as beat percentage.Though several sectors are nearing the last leg of their reporting cycle, we are yet to see results from quite a few food stocks that form part of the Consumer Staples sector that is currently placed among the bottom 38% out of all Zacks sectors. Per the latest Earnings Trends, the sector is likely to witness earnings growth of 3.3% on a 1.5% rise in revenues.How is the Food Space Placed?The food Industry has been grappling with several issues of late, including stiff competition, sluggish traffic and an intense promotional environment stemming from consumers’ changing preferences. Moreover, the food space is battling soft volumes and inflated input prices. Back-to-back hurricanes also had a detrimental impact on food stocks with operations spread in the affected regions.While these factors make us jittery about the performance of food stocks in the quarter to be reported, we expect the companies to keep gaining from their focus on acquisitions, packaging methods and innovations, which have long been their growth drivers. Evidently, benefits from buyouts fueled top and bottom lines of Pinnacle Foods Inc. (PF  -  Free Report) and SUPERVALU INC (SVU  -  Free Report) in their recently reported results. Also, food companies have been undertaking efforts to expand in the fast-growing organic goods space to resonate with the changing consumer demand. These factors, along with stringent cost-saving initiatives should cushion the food stocks from industry headwinds.Another factor that works in favor of food stocks is that they are relatively less vulnerable to adverse economic conditions, though they’re sure to step up during economic recovery when higher disposable income increases the demand for food. That said, we also remain encouraged about food stocks’ performance, given the favorable economic indicators like improving employment scenario and higher consumer confidence. Incidentally, Consumer Confidence — a key determinant of the economy’s health — reached its highest level in almost 17 years in this October.How to Pick Prospective WinnersAmid these mixed signals, we used the Zacks methodology and identified food stocks that not only boast solid fundamentals but are also poised to beat earnings estimates this earnings season. Our research shows that for stocks with the combination of a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP, the chance of a positive earnings surprise is as high as 70%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.That said, investors can count on these stocks which are most likely to top estimates.Tyson Foods, Inc. (TSN  -  Free Report), which is slated to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Nov 13, is a solid bet. The company’s Earnings ESP of +1.28% and Zacks Rank #2 make us reasonably confident of a positive surprise. We expect the company to continue gaining from rise in demand at the beef and chicken segments. Rising preference for protein rich brands in the prepared foods category is also expected to favor Tyson Foods’ performance. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter is pegged at $1.37.Another stock worth considering is The J. M. Smucker Company (SJM  -  Free Report), which has an Earnings ESP of +0.88% and a Zacks Rank #3. This consumer food and beverage products, and pet food and snacks manufacturer is scheduled to post second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Nov 16. J.M. Smucker’s consensus mark for earnings is currently pegged at $1.89. Notably, the company has a long-term earnings growth rate of 6.6%.We also suggest investing in Nomad Foods Limited (NOMD  -  Free Report), which is slated to report third-quarter 2017 results on Nov 28. This manufacturer and distributor of frozen foods has an Earnings ESP of +8.70%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter is currently pegged at 23 cents. Further, the company, which has delivered back-to-back positive earnings surprises in the past two quarters, sports a Zacks Rank #1. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. Another viable option is Hormel Foods Corporation (HRL  -  Free Report), a leading manufacturer and marketer of various meat and food products in the United States and international markets. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 and has an Earnings ESP of +1.52%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter is pegged at 39 cents. The company, which has a long-term earnings growth rate of 9.3%, is slated to announce fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Nov 21.Investors can also place bets on United Natural Foods, Inc. (UNFI  -  Free Report), which is expected to release first-quarter fiscal 2018 results next month.  This leading distributor of natural, organic and specialty food and non-food products has an impressive earnings surprise history, and a long-term earnings growth rate of 5%. Notably, United Natural Foods’ Zacks Rank #2 and Earnings ESP of +6.33% indicate that the company is likely to maintain its solid surprise trend. We expect the company’s diversified portfolio and synergies from acquisitions to aid the beat. The current consensus estimate for the quarter is pegged at 59 cents.Well, these five stocks are not the only ones to bet on. With the help of the Zacks Stock Screener and some permutation and combination, you can also discover other consumer staples stocks that have the potential to deliver a positive earnings surprise.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

627,TSN,"The tariff war between the United States and China have caused worries for several agricultural and meat exporting companies, including Tyson Foods, Inc. (TSN  -  Free Report). Recently, China hiked duties on several U.S. export items, including a 25% tariff on pork, in retaliation to the latter’s tariff stance. Incidentally, this caused the company’s shares to drop almost 6.2% on Apr 2.Per sources, China is one of the largest markets for U.S. pork exports both in terms of value and volume. Analysts pointed that the raised tariff rate is expected to cause significant loss of market in China for several meat exporters, marring revenues for Tyson Foods and other prominent players in the meat industry such as Hormel Foods Corporation (HRL  -  Free Report).While China’s tariff rates have caused dark clouds to hover on the meat industry, Tyson Foods has many reasons to stay optimistic, courtesy of its rich portfolio of protein-packed brands, well yielding acquisitions and steadily surging demand for protein products in several markets. That said, let’s take a closer look at some of the factors aiding the company’s performance.  Rising Demand Bodes WellTyson Foods has been steadily gaining from enhanced sales across its Beef, Chicken and Prepared Foods owing to rising demand for protein-packed products. Management projects consistent rise in demand for such products and has plans to exploit opportunities in this space. For fiscal 2018, USDA expects overall domestic protein production to rise roughly 3% year over year. Such positive market scenario has driven Tyson Foods to make several investments, especially in expanding poultry production. Apart from this, the company has been steadily expanding fresh prepared foods offering, courtesy of consumers’ rising demand for natural fresh meat offerings without added hormones or antibiotics.Acquisitions Aid GrowthAdditionally, Tyson Foods has been focusing on acquisitions to expand its portfolio. In fact, the AdvancePierre buyout has been favoring the Prepared Foods segment. The acquisition led to a 2.4% and 9.5% rise in sales volume during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2017, while in first-quarter fiscal 2018 sales volume jumped 11.6%. Further, the company expects additional sales of approximately $1.1 billion from AdvancePierre during fiscal 2018.  Financial Fitness ProgramToward the latter half of 2017, Tyson Foods announced a Financial Fitness Program, directed toward enhancing operating efficiency, reduce overheads and fuel bottom-line growth. Incidentally, the company generated savings of nearly $37 million from this program in the first quarter. Further, the company aims to generate savings from this program, through synergies from AdvancePierre’s integration along with incremental cost optimization. These efforts are anticipated to generate total savings of roughly $200 million in fiscal 2018 and roughly $600 million by 2020.Final ThoughtsWell, it is yet to be seen whether China’s raised tariff rates on pork will have negative impacts on Tyson Foods’ performance. Moreover, the company’s robust portfolio, strong geographic reach in approximately 117 countries along with its strategic buyouts and investments to meet the rising demand for protein-packed products are expected to counter the challenges stemming from the China market. In fact, such well-planned initiatives have aided this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong buy) company’s shares gain as much as 10.6% in a year, almost in-line with the industry’s rally of 10.7%. On that note, we are confident that Tyson Foods will be able to maintain its position as one of the prominent players in the food industry and counter challenges strategically.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Greedy for Consumer Staples Stocks?

628,TSN,"It was a sigh of relief in the Wall Street when major indices ended in the green on the first trading day of the week, as talks between the United States and China on trade agreement began. But experts believe that the market will take some time to recover from the damage inflicted by escalated trade tensions between the world's biggest economies and the Facebook data fiasco.Keeping aside the recent market gyrations, market pundits are of the opinion that the economy is not in a bad shape after all. The Fed’s optimistic view also throws light on the same. The Fed Chairperson envisions economy growth of 2.7% in 2018, up from the previous forecast of 2.5%.

629,TSN,"After a blockbuster start to 2018, the Wall Street once again saw a tumultuous ride last week thanks to a tech selloff, Fed rates hike and trade war fears. In particular, the major bourses suffered their worst week in more than two years with the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 tumbling 5.7% and 5.9%, respectively. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite Index dropped 6.5% (read: Play These Inverse ETFs to Profit From Market Bloodbath).The massive decline came in late last week following Trump’s announcement that he is seeking to impose a tariff of up to $60 billion on Chinese imports in response to intellectual property theft from U.S. businesses. In response, China seems to be preparing for retaliation with a proposed list of 128 U.S. products worth $3 billion. This has made investors jittery, leading to risk-off trading, as tariffs will spur retaliation from China, triggering a global trade war between the world’s two largest economies.However, the fear seems to have abated following the latest reports from Wall Street Journal that both the United States and China have started negotiating to improve American access to Chinese markets. Additionally, Trump exempted South Korea from steel tariffs levied earlier this month, suggesting that the President is using a fierce approach for more negotiating power rather than any real intention to start a global trade war. Given this, U.S. stocks rebounded strongly at the start of this week with the S&P 500 and Dow Jones gaining nearly 2% at the time of writing.Further, strong corporate earnings, optimism surrounding Trump’s tax cut policies, pick-up in growth in developed and developing economies, robust job gains, growing wages, increasing consumer spending, a recovering housing market and a record level of consumer confidence will continue to drive the nine-year bulls (read: Best Performing ETFs of 9-Year Bull Run).Given the bullish fundamentals, the selloff seen last week might charge up investors to snap up ETFs and stocks on the cheap for outsized gains in the coming weeks.How to Find Bargain ETFs?Using our database, first we have selected ETFs with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). This is because these ranks suggest strengthening fundamentals and superior weighting methodologies that could allow them to lead higher than their cousins in a booming market.

630,TSN,"With rising consumer spending on beauty products along with rapidly changing cultural ideals, catalyzed by social media and e-commerce platforms, firms such as The Estee Lauder Companies Inc. (EL  -  Free Report) have reasons to continue looking attractive in investors’ eyes.Well, shares of this leading cosmetics company surged 73.2% in a year, comfortably outperforming the industry’s rally of 39.9%. This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company has been reporting strong results across most geographic regions and product categories, fueled by strategic acquisitions, strong online business and effective management policies.Let’s take a closer look at some of the aspects driving the company’s spectacular performance and see if it can add laurels to its growth story.Acquisitions: A Vital Growth DriverEstee Lauder has made several strategic acquisitions to enhance its portfolio. The acquisitions of BECCA and Too Faced in the past  strengthened its fastest growing prestige portfolio and contributed nearly 2 percentage points to sales growth in the second quarter of fiscal 2018. Also, management expects these brands to contribute roughly 2 percentage points to the company’s overall sales growth in fiscal 2018. The investment in DECIEM — a fast-growing multi-brand company — is likely to aid beauty sales in the forthcoming periods.  Robust Online BusinessEstee Lauder has a strong online business and the company expects it to be a major growth catalyst in the upcoming years. The company has been constantly implementing digital experiences such as online booking for each store appointment, omni-channel loyalty programs and advanced mobile services. These initiatives have been boosting the company’s online sales for a while, and boosting its overall top line. During second-quarter fiscal 2018, online sales were strong and primarily driven by a robust holiday-season performance. Owing to technological advancement and the increasing popularity of social media, mobile sales have been growing considerably. In fact, mobile sales soared more than 70% during the key holiday period. Further, Estee Lauder is focused on widening its global online presence by adding new sites and expanding retailer distributions.Travel Retail Opens up Business Expansion ProspectsEstee Lauder has been strongly focusing on enhancing travel retail business, which has lately emerged onto becoming a major sales driver for the company. Management stated that growth in this category is majorly fueled by the company’s continued investments in emerging markets, particularly in Asia, along with double-digit increases in five of its biggest brands in the travel retail network. Well, the company is committed toward undertaking greater strategic efforts to enhance travel retail business. Vital endeavors in this regard include better customer insights, merchandising efficiency and digital marketing efforts.Wrapping it UpDespite persisting concerns surrounding lower sales in North America due to a decline in retail traffic in the U.S. brick-and-mortar stores, Estee Lauder is likely to overcome such hurdles on the back of well-chalked initiatives. Moreover, management expects continued growth opportunities in the global prestige beauty industry, which is projected to grow 5% in fiscal 2018. Additionally, acquisitions, better-quality products, innovation, improved market reach and gains from the recently enacted tax reforms are expected to aid performance in the forthcoming periods. With such positive factors rolled up in its sleeves, Estee Lauder is expected to continue growing and attain new highs.Greedy for Consumer Staples Stocks?

631,TSN,"The earnings season is in full swing and the picture this quarter has been exceptionally good — with more than usual number of companies delivering better-than-expected performance. Moreover, companies are witnessing significant uptrend in estimates for the current as well as the subsequent quarter.Per the latest Earnings Trend 251 S&P 500 companies have already put up their quarterly show. Earnings of these companies advanced 16% year over year on the back of 10.5% jump in revenues. Further, 80.5% of these companies topped bottom-line estimates, while 78.1% posted positive revenue surprise.For the quarter under review, earnings for the total S&P 500 companies are envisioned to rise 13%, with revenues anticipated to grow 7.7%. This fares better than the previous quarter, wherein total earnings rose 6.7% on revenue growth of 5.9%. Encouragingly, out of the 16 Zacks sectors, 14 are estimated to witness year-over-year earnings growth. The Consumer Staples sector, which also houses major foods stocks, seems to be one of them.How is Consumer Staples Placed?Well, we are yet to see the main show from this space, with many players scheduled to release earnings this week itself. The Consumer Staples sector seems to be well placed for the season, given favorable economic indicators like improved labor market and healthy consumer spending. To top it, President Trump’s recent tax overhaul is likely to cushion many consumer companies.Further, we note that growth efforts such as focus on innovations, strategic buyouts as well as product launches, are likely to keep driving the players in this space — including food stocks. However, heightened competition, price wars and input cost inflation remain threats for the sector that is currently ranked among the bottom 44% out of all Zacks sectors. Nevertheless, aggressive cost-saving initiatives and attempts to keep pace with changing consumer patterns are likely to provide cushion.This is evident from the overall expectations for the sector that gained 6.3% in a year, while the S&P 500 rallied 18.3%. For this earnings season, the bottom line of the Consumer Staples space is envisioned to climb 7.3% year over year with the top line is anticipated to advance 1.9%. While earnings forecast is higher than 3.9% growth witnessed in the preceding quarter, the revenue projection on par with the previous quarter growth. That said, let’s see what awaits the following food stocks that are queued up for earnings releases on Feb 8.Well our research shows that for stocks with the combination of a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP, the chance of a positive earnings surprise is high. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Tyson Foods or Kellogg?Tyson Foods, Inc. (TSN  -  Free Report) is slated to report first-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Feb 8, before the opening bell. We expect Tyson Foods to continue gaining from rise in demand at the chicken and the beef segments. Also, the company’s prepared foods category has been depicting solid growth owing to rising demand for protein-packed brands and synergies from the AdvancePierre’s buyout.Notably, Tyson Foods has been benefiting from its strategic buyouts, focus on protein-packed brands and nutritious products as well as significant geographical foothold. Impressively, the company witnessed major sales from the markets of Canada, Central America, China, the European Union, Japan, Mexico, Middle East, South Korea and Taiwan.  However, the company’s earnings estimate of $1.51 for the fiscal first quarter depicts a year-over-year decline of roughly 5% from the year-ago period figure. This might be due to the company’s exposure to the risk of raw material price volatility. Also, stiff competition and intense promotions remain headwinds. Rising wage costs also pose threats to Tyson Foods’ operating results. Tyson Foods, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Tyson Foods, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Tyson Foods, Inc. Quote Tyson Foods has an Earnings ESP of -0.17%. Although, the company’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP but a negative ESP makes our surprise prediction difficult. Nevertheless, management announced a Financial Fitness Program last quarter, that is expected to enhance operating efficiency in the forthcoming periods. All these initiatives are likely to drive the company in the first quarter. (Read More: Factors You Must Know Ahead of Tyson Foods Q1 Earnings)Kellogg Company (K  -  Free Report) is set to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 8 before the opening bell. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 12.9%. The company also surpassed expectations in each of the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 7.88%. However, the company has been witnessing top-line weakness for the last two years, primarily due to lower demand. Particularly, weak performance of its cereal products in developed markets as well as soft U.S. snacks business has been negatively impacting the company.Further, Kellogg has been struggling due to the shift in consumer preference toward natural and organic ingredients over packaged and processed food. This trend is unlikely to change in the to-be-reported quarter and Kellogg expects its top line to remain subdued in 2017, decreasing 3% from 2016 level on a currency-neutral comparable basis. Nonetheless, given the tepid sales growth, the company is making aggressive efforts toward improving its food offerings. The company is investing in brand building, in-store capabilities along with product and packaging innovation. Further, the company’s sales in Brazil are likely to benefit from the Parati acquisition. The company’s sales are also expected to somewhat benefit from Pringles’ improved performance in Europe.Cost-savings initiatives like Project K and zero-based budgeting program are also somewhat compensating for the weakness in sales. Although the top line has been weak, Kellogg’s margin growth has been impressive. Pricing and mix improvement is anticipated to give support to its bottom-line growth. Currency headwinds are also expected to diminish, thereby further supporting EPS growth. Overall, for the fourth quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 96 cents, reflecting a 4.4% year-over-year increase. However, this Zacks Rank #3 company has an Earnings ESP of -0.26%, which makes surprise prediction difficult. (Read More: Kellogg Q4 Earnings: What's in Store for the Stock?) Kellogg Company Price and EPS Surprise  Kellogg Company Price and EPS Surprise | Kellogg Company Quote Thus, it looks like Kellogg’s earnings growth prospects are better than that of Tyson Foods. However, we prefer to wait and see how things actually shape up for these food stocks this earnings season.Zacks Top 10 Stocks for 2018In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest buy-and-hold tickers for the entirety of 2018? Last year's 2017 Zacks Top 10 Stocks portfolio produced double-digit winners, including FMC Corp. and VMware which racked up stellar gains of +67.9% and +61%.

632,TSN,"Tyson Foods, Inc. (TSN  -  Free Report) took yet another step to expand its portfolio of meat products and address the rising protein demand. The leading chicken, meat and prepared foods producer’s venture capital arm – Tyson Ventures made an investment in Memphis Meats, with the deal terms remaining under covers.Memphis Meats concentrates on developing ways to produce cultural meat directly from animals’ cells without killing them — a method that is not only safer for animals but is also better for the environment and consumers. This food-tech startup intends to use the funds from Tyson Foods to speed up product development. While Tyson Foods now holds a minority stake in Memphis Foods, the latter has attracted many other investors in the past including Cargill, Bill Gates, DFJ, Atomico and Richard Branson.Tyson Foods’ latest move underscores its constant efforts to expand its protein-rich offerings, as the demand for such products has been growing and is expected to rise further in the times ahead. Alongside the widening demography of protein-savvy consumers, traditional meat sales face intense pressure due to increasing environmental concerns about intensive animal farming and animal welfare. Given these factors, we believe that the aforementioned investment deems fit.Focus on Protein-Packed Products: A Major DriverWell, Tyson Foods has long been making efforts to expand protein-packed brands. In this regard, the company’s AdvancePierre buyout favorably impacted the Prepared Foods segment’s performance in the last two quarters. To further enrich the Prepared Foods category, the company announced the buyout of Original Philly Holdings in November 2017. Management continues to expect positive synergies from the acquisitions.Additionally, the company made investments of $84 million (in August 2017) and $300 million (in November 2017) to expand poultry production capacity in Tennessee.  Other than this, the company has also undertaken divesture of non-protein businesses (such as Sara Lee Frozen Bakery, Kettle and Van’s) to focus more on the growing protein-packed food arena.All said, Tyson Foods seems to be well equipped with the categories that are currently in high demand at the national foodservice chains. Further, the company is set to make significant investments to improve the supply network within the food-service channel.Notably, Tyson Foods’ top- and bottom-line results have been gaining from such efforts, which have also boosted investors’ confidence in the stock. Markedly, the company’s shares have rallied nearly 28% in a year, surpassing the industry’s upside of 20.5%. We believe that efforts like the aforementioned investment in Memphis Meats, is likely to spur further growth for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company.  Looking for More Promising Stocks?

After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings—with the most up-to-date information possible—is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for TSN in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $1.31 per share for TSN, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.27 per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for TSN, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of 3.15% heading into earnings season.Tyson Foods, Inc.

635,TSN,"Altria Group, Inc. (MO  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 27, before the market opens.The question lingering in investors’ minds is, whether this tobacco maker will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the to-be-reported quarter. The company’s earnings have lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.4% in the first quarter. However, it has pulled off average positive earnings surprise of 0.7% in the trailing four quarters.Let us see how things are shaping up for this announcement.What Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Our proven model does not conclusively show earnings beat for Altria this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP for this to happen. You may uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Altria Group Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Altria Group Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Altria Group QuoteAltria has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 86 cents. Moreover, the company carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), which further makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Which Way Are Estimates Treading?Let’s look at the estimate revisions in order to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company right before earnings release. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the second quarter has declined by a penny in the last 30 days, while the same has remained stable at $3.28 for 2017.Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $4.97 billion and $19.70 billion for the second quarter and 2017, respectively.Factors Influencing the QuarterWe note that Altria has been witnessing declining demand for cigarettes due to the ongoing anti-tobacco campaigns, government restrictions and higher cigarette prices in response to rising taxes on it. In fact, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has also made it mandatory for tobacco companies to use precautionary labels on cigarette packets to dissuade customers from smoking. These regulations adversely impact the company’s performance and, in turn, its overall profitability. Additionally, consumers’ preference for e-cigarettes or substitutes for cigarettes are largely affecting the cigarette volume.Evidently, Altria’s top line lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in six of the last seven quarters, including the last reported quarter. We expect the company to continue to feel the pinch of declining cigarette volumes in the upcoming quarter.As smoking rates are declining in developed countries, the race to replace traditional cigarettes is putting pressure on the tobacco industry. Particularly, serious health hazards due to cigarette smoking have pushed consumers toward low-risk or reduced-risk products.To match up this trend, the company is also shifting toward low-risk, smokeless tobacco products. Its flagship MarkTen e-cigarette brand (launched in 2014) and Green Smoke e-vapor products are expected to boost Altria’s results in the near term.A glimpse of Altria’s stock performance shows that its shares have gained 3.5% in the last six months, underperforming the industry’s rally of 13.2%. In fact, the industry is currently placed at the bottom 25% (191 out of 256). Meanwhile, the broader Consumer Staples sector, of which they are part of, advanced 7.7%. Per the latest Earnings Preview, the earnings growth for the sector looks decent. While total earnings for the Consumer Staples sector are estimated to rise 3.1%, revenues are projected to improve 1.2%.Stocks with Favorable CombinationHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:The Clorox Company (CLX  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.67% and a Zacks Rank #2.

636,TSN,"Companhia Brasileira de Distribuicao (CBD  -  Free Report) is set to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 25. The company posted a positive earnings surprise of 30% in the preceding quarter.A glimpse at CBD’s stock performance shows that it has been gaining ground over the last six months. Shares of this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock have gained 12.4% over the said time frame, outperforming the industry’s 8.7% gain. Notably, the industry is part of the top 41% of the Zacks Classified industries (108 out of the 256).Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Which Way Are the Estimates Headed?Let’s look at the estimate revision trend in order to get a clear picture of what analysts expect from the company right before the earnings release. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter and 2017 earnings has been stable over the last 30 days.Companhia Brasileira de Distribuicao Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Companhia Brasileira de Distribuicao Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Companhia Brasileira de Distribuicao QuoteWhat Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Our proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for CBD this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP for this to happen.CBD has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 6 cents. Although the company’s Zacks Rank #2 increases the predictive power of ESP, we need a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise. You may uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revisions momentum.Factors at PlayOn Jul 12, the company announced sales results for the second quarter, wherein it reported net growth of 9.0% driven by strength at Assai and the Extra banner. Both Multivarejo and Assai continued to gain market traction in the quarter. However, sales growth was lower than the preceding quarter’s 9.5% hike on a year-over-year basis. Comparable store sales grew 13.5% in the quarter, with strong customer traffic expansion and increase in sales volume offsetting the effect of the slowdown in food inflation. Inflation levels declined from 5.2% in the first quarter to 2.3% in the second.During the second quarter, the company opened three stores, of which two were in the Minuto Pao de Acucar format and one in Assai (another four are under construction).We note that this Brazilian company has been showing strong improvement in Extra Hiper markets and consistent growth at Assai.Store openings and conversion of Extra Hiper stores to Assai is also boosting sales. The conversions will help accelerate expansion of GPA’s cash-and-carry banner into new cities and states across Brazil. We are also encouraged by the company’s operating efficiency and productivity projects. Further, a higher gross margin and a decline in selling, general and administrative expenses at Multivarejo boosted the EBITDA margin.However, CBD has been witnessing margin compression over the past many quarters. It is struggling to keep prices in check in the face of inflation in Brazil, which is hurting gross margin. Also, strong growth in the Assai business, though helping sales growth, is impacting margins as this business is characterized by low prices. A challenging economic scenario in Brazil has also dampened demand and consumer confidence.Stocks Poised to Beat Earnings EstimatesHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:The Clorox Company (CLX  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.67% and a Zacks Rank #2.

637,TSN,"Kimberly-Clark Corporation (KMB  -  Free Report) is set to report second-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Jul 25. Investors want to know whether the company will deliver a positive earnings surprise in the to-be-reported quarter. The company’s earnings exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 1.5%.A look into Kimberly-Clark’s stock performance, reveals that its shares have been underperforming the Zacks categorized Consumer Products–Staples industry in the past three months. In the said time frame, stocks of the company went down 4.6%, compared with the industry’s decline of 0.6%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Which Way are Estimates Trending A look at the estimate revision would give us an idea regarding analyst’s expectations right before the company releases its earnings. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second quarter decreased by a penny in the past 30 days while the same has remained stable for fiscal 2017 at $6.29. However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.50 per share for the second quarter reflects a year-over-year decrease of 2%. Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $4.58 billion for the said quarter, a 0.2% decline from the year-ago period, while the same for fiscal 2017 is pegged at $18.5 billion.What Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Kimberly-Clark is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter.

The company carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, its ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.Kimberly-Clark Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Kimberly-Clark Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Kimberly-Clark Corporation QuoteFactors Influencing the QuarterKimberly-Clark has been dealing with decelerated organic sales growth, especially in developing and emerging markets over the past few quarters. The decline in sales growth is primarily due to lower volumes and a difficult economic scenario. Moreover, the company’s diaper segment is witnessing lower market share and higher competitive promotional activity as consumers are seen to shift to either premium or less expensive diaper offerings.Nonetheless, the company is focused on improving its performance through regular innovation. In the near term, it has a number of innovations lined up for launch in North America. The company has been aggressively cutting costs through its FORCE program that has been generating higher cost savings each year. The program generated costs savings of $435 million in 2016 and expects savings of at least $400 million in 2017. Evidently, it already achieved $110 million of cost savings in the first quarter.Kimberly-Clark is well positioned in the overseas and has been regularly expanding in diverse regions. Though the company has strong long-term growth prospects in developing and emerging markets, it expects only modest improvement in the overall environment in 2017, particularly in the second half.Still Interested in Consumer Staples Stocks?

639,TSN,"Tyson Foods, Inc. (TSN  -  Free Report) is slated to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Nov 13, before the opening bell.We expect the company to continue gaining from rise in demand at the beef and chicken segments. Rising preference for protein rich brands in the prepared foods category is also expected to favor Tyson Foods’ performance in the to-be-reported quarter.Let’s now take a look at how things are shaping up for this announcement.Which Way are Estimates Treading? The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2017 has improved in the last 30 days. Estimates for the fourth quarter moved up 2 cents to $1.37. The consensus mark for fiscal 2017 depicts an increase of 3 cents to $5.22. We note that on Sep 28, management raised fiscal 2017 earnings outlook to the range of $5.20-$5.30 per share, higher than the previous guidance of $4.95-$5.05. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2017 reflects year-over-year growth of 42.7% and 18.9%, respectively. Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect net sales of $9,951 million for the said quarter, up 8.7% from the year-ago quarter. Also, sales for fiscal 2017 are projected to inch up 2.9% to $38 billion. Tyson Foods, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Tyson Foods, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Tyson Foods, Inc. Quote Factors at PlayTyson Foods has been benefitting from increased demand across beef, pork and chicken segments. The company’s prepared food segment has also been witnessing steady growth backed by the surging demand for protein-packed brands. These factors are expected to favorably impact the company’s top and bottom line in the upcoming quarterly results.Notably, the consensus mark for sales in the beef segment is projected to grow 4.8% to reach $3,645 million in the fourth quarter. Improved availability of cattle supply, surging domestic demand and higher exports are likely to favor the beef segment’s performance. The consensus estimate for sales in the pork segment is expected to move up 5% to $1,297 million, backed by improving demand for pork products. Also, this category has been gaining from higher exports for a while. This may serve as a tailwind in the fourth quarter.Tyson Foods’ chicken segment has also been depicting sturdy growth, driven by the increasing number of health-conscious consumers who have been shifting away from processed food and red meat. The segment has also been serving as a suitable platform for undertaking innovation and adding new products to an already rich food line up. Driven by such upsides, the consensus mark for sales at the chicken segment in the fourth quarter is expected to increase 3.7% to reach $2,916 million.Moving on, Tyson Foods’ prepared food segment is also expected to continue benefiting from the positive synergies of the AdvancePierre buyout. Through the acquisition, management has also been trying to expand fresh food offerings alongside of steady advancement in the protein brands portfolio. Driven by such factors, consensus estimate for sales in the prepared food segment is expected to surge 22.3% to reach $2,247 million in the upcoming fourth-quarter results.In addition to expanding product portfolio, the company is reinventing its supply-chain and procurement processes, while lowering overhead expenses to boost savings. It has also been streamlining operations and adhering to downsizing in several locations to combat rising wage-related costs.What does the Zacks Model Unveil?

640,TSN,"For generating handsome returns, one has to invest in risky stocks. This seems to be a thumb rule for most investors. The strategy works extremely well for securities or portfolios that are directly correlated with the market. But the converse scenario should also be taken into account.With extensive research we have come up with a strategy that proves lucrative returns could also be generated from less risky stocks.Meaning of BetaBeta indicates the volatility of a particular stock with respect to the market. In other words, beta measures the extent of stock price movement relative to the market (we are considering S&P 500 here).If a company has a beta of 1, it means that the relative volatility of the stock is the same as that of the S&P 500. In the same way, if the stock’s beta is greater than 1 then it is more volatile compared to the market. Conversely, a beta below 1 signifies less volatility.Now, if a portfolio’s beta is 3, it is three times more volatile than the market. Hence, if the market is projected to give 20% return, the portfolio will then definitely contribute 60% return which is amazing.However, the opposite case also holds true. If the market slips 20% then the portfolio return plummets 60% which is surely a matter of concern.The Winning StrategyIn our screening criteria we included beta in the range of 0 to 0.6 for short listing low risk stocks. But this can’t be the only criterion for betting on stocks. The other parameters that need to be added to create a winning portfolio are:Percentage Change in Price in the Last 4 Weeks greater than zero: This ensures that the stocks saw positive price movement over the last one month.Average 20 Day Volume greater than 50,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stocks are easily tradable.Price greater than or equal to $5: They must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.Zacks Rank equal to 1: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks indicate that they will significantly outperform the broader U.S. equity market over the next one to three months.Here are five of the 15 stocks that qualified the screening:Headquartered in AR, Tyson Foods, Inc. (TSN  -  Free Report) was founded in 1935. It is the biggest U.S. chicken company and produces, distributes and markets chicken, beef, pork as well as prepared foods. The company is expected to report year-over-year earnings growth of 18.2% for fiscal 2017. Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 has been revised upward over the last 30 days.Based in Paramus, NJ, Movado Group, Inc. (MOV  -  Free Report) is a leading distributer of fine watches all over the world. The company posted an average positive earnings surprise of 2.54% for the last four quarters. Also, we are expecting Movado Group to witness year-over-year earnings growth of 2% for fiscal 2018.Headquartered in Salt Lake City, UT, Myriad Genetics, Inc. (MYGN  -  Free Report) employs a number of proprietary technologies to target the genetic basis of human diseases. The company managed to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 6.17%.PRA Health Sciences, Inc. (PRAH  -  Free Report) headquartered in Raleigh, NC, is the leading provider of outsourced services related to clinical developments. The company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in each of the last four quarters with an average positive surprise of 6.10%. PRA Health is projected to report year-over-year earnings growth of 26.3% for 2017.Based in Greenwich, CT, Urstadt Biddle Properties Inc. (UBA  -  Free Report) is the leading investor in the U.S. real estate market.

641,TSN,"The Consumer Staples sector is home to daily-use products that makes it to an extent immune to economic headwinds. In fact, the sector is considered defensive and is currently benefiting from buoyant economy and improving consumer confidence, despite a competitive landscape and geopolitical turmoil.Despite belonging to the sector, Campbell Soup Company (CPB  -  Free Report), the manufacturer and marketer of high-quality, branded convenience food products, has been struggling to find place in investors’ good books. This Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) company’s shares have declined 23.6% so far this year, wider than the industry’s loss of 10.2%.A Deeper Insight Into Campbell’s PerformanceWe note that Campbell’s top and bottom-line results have lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the last two quarters. Moreover, the company has reported an average negative earnings surprise of 1.2% in the trailing four quarters.Furthermore, the company’s top-line has missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in nine of the trailing 10 quarters, and hasn’t witnessed a single quarter of year-over-year top-line growth for a while now. As Campbell is known for its canned foods, much of its sales debacle could be attributed to consumers’ changing eating patterns and their evolving preferences for healthy, fresh and organic food products. Also, the company’s Campbell Fresh division has just witnessed slight recovery in the final quarter of fiscal 2017, before which it was marred by lingering constraints from the Bolthouse Farms Protein PLUS drinks recall in June 2016.Moving ahead, the company expects the operating environment to remain tough in fiscal 2018, wherein it also expects to witness cost inflation. Well, management stated that it anticipates the first-half results to remain significantly soft, which clearly remains a concern in the near term.Additionally, the company faces intense global competition for nearly all its key products. Consequently, excessive pressure from competitors is likely to cause Campbell to incur greater marketing and other costs or reduce prices, all of these are likely to hurt the company's overall performance.How is the Consumer Staples Sector Positioned?Though Campbell is plagued with problems at the moment, there are many stocks in the Consumer Staples space that seems to be gaining from the improving economic situation. A look at the sector’s performance shows that it has gained 10.1% year to date, narrower than the S&P 500 Index’s growth of 13.8%. Nevertheless, it carries a Zacks Sector Rank of #3 (out of 16), placing it at the top 19% of the Zacks classified sectors.4 Trending PicksWhile Campbell deals with the aforementioned challenges, here is a look at the four food companies that carry a strong Zacks Rank and look well-positioned to benefit from the current scenario. Also, our research shows that a stock with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), combined with a VGM Score of A or B, has robust growth potentials.First on the list is, Tyson Foods, Inc. (TSN  -  Free Report), a leading U.S. chicken company, and producer, and marketer of chicken, beef, pork as well as prepared foods. Notably, the company’s shares have rallied 17% in the past three months, faring better than the industry’s gain of 12.4%. Currently, the stock sports a Zacks Rank #1 and has a VGM Score of A, which highlights its inherent strengths. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Another lucrative option is Pilgrim's Pride Corporation (PPC  -  Free Report) engaged in the processing, production, marketing and distribution of frozen, fresh as well as value-added chicken products. The stock boasts a VGM Score of A and a Zacks Rank #1. Also, the company’s shares have surged 34% in the past three months, ahead of the industrys growth of 12.4%.Sysco Corporation (SYY  -  Free Report), the leading marketer and distributor of food and related products primarily to the foodservice or food-away-from-home industry, is also a solid bet. The company’s shares have advanced 7.4% in the past three months, as against the industry’s fall of 2.6%. Currently, the stock has a VGM Score of A  and a long-term earnings growth rate of 8.4%. It carries a Zacks Rank #2.Finally, United Natural Foods, Inc. (UNFI  -  Free Report), the leading distributor of natural, organic and specialty food and non-food products in the United States and Canada, looks promising too. A glimpse of the company’s share price performance reveals that it has witnessed growth of 12.6% in the last three months against the industry’s fall of 2.6%. Also, the stock boasts a VGM Score of A and a Zacks Rank #2. Further, it has a long-term earnings growth rate of 5%.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

642,TSN,"Wall Street witnessed brutal trading last week, with the major indices suffering the worst weekly fall in more than two years. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 tumbled 5.7% and 5.9%, respectively, while the Nasdaq Composite Index shed 6.5%. The Facebook (FB  -  Free Report)-led tech selloff, Fed rates hike, and a trade war brewing between the United States and China were the major culprits.However, the worries seem to be abating, thanks to the news that the Trump administration has agreed to exempt South Korea from steel tariffs and start negotiating with China to avert a global trade war, which has threatened economic growth and hammered financial markets around the world.Last week, Trump signed an executive memorandum to impose tariffs of up to $60 billion on Chinese imports targeting the technology, telecommunications and apparel sectors. In response, China has proposed a list of 128 U.S. products worth $3 billion as potential retaliation targets. The list includes wine, fresh fruit, dried fruit and nuts, steel pipes, modified ethanol and ginseng, with a potential 15% duty, and pork and recycled aluminum goods with a possible 25% tariff.Global trade tensions are likely to threaten the nine-year bull market in the weeks ahead, as talks between the two countries are yet to unfold and thus, keep volatility alive. As a result, most investors’ are still cautious as to how the negotiations will take place and what its impact on the financial world will be. Further, Washington turmoil and geopolitical tensions will continue to weigh on the stocks.Bulls Remain IntactAside from trade war fears, long-term market fundamentals remained bullish. Encouraging domestic and international fundamentals, strong corporate earnings and the new tax legislation are the biggest catalysts for the stock market this year. Additionally, growth in the U.S. economy has been solid, buoyed by an impressive labor market, higher wages, increasing consumer spending and record consumer confidence.In particular, the massive $1.5-trillion tax cut is expected to provide a huge boost to stocks. This is because it will create an economic surge, boosting job growth in manufacturing and other sectors, increasing inflation and interest rates. Additionally, it would lead to higher earnings, increased buyback activities and fat dividends.Earnings estimates for Q1 and the following quarters have gone up, with tax law changes being the most notable reason for the positive revisions. These revisions are broad-based, with estimates for 13 of the 16 Zacks sectors going up. Total earnings for the S&P 500 index are expected to be up 18% on 5.6% higher revenues for 2018. For 2019, earnings and revenues for the index are expected to be up 9.5% and 4.1%, respectively.Given the bullish trends, we have highlighted some stock-picking ideas from the top-ranked cohort for investors that could prove extremely beneficial in the current market environment, reducing the risk of a downside:Low-Beta StocksLow-beta stocks exhibit greater levels of stability and usually lose less when the market is crumbling. Though these have lesser risks and lower returns, the stocks are considered safe and resilient.Tyson Foods Inc. (TSN  -  Free Report) having beta of 0.20 seems a good bet in this category. Based in Springdale, AR, it is one of the world’s largest producers of chicken, beef, pork and prepared foods, offering a wide range of protein-based and prepared foods products. It has an expected earnings growth of 25.24% for the year (ending September 2018). The stock carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and has a VGM Score of B. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Value StocksValue stocks have proven to be outperformers over the long term and are less susceptible to trending markets. These stocks have strong fundamentals — earnings, dividends, book value and cash flow — that trade below their intrinsic value and are undervalued. These have the potential to deliver higher returns and exhibit lower volatility compared with their growth and blend counterparts.The Missouri-based Centene Corporation (CNC  -  Free Report) is a diversified, multi-national healthcare enterprise that provides a portfolio of services to government sponsored and commercial healthcare programs, focusing on under-insured and uninsured individuals. It has a Value Score of A and an estimated earnings growth of 40.95% for this year. The stock has a Zacks Rank #1.Small-Cap StocksEven though small-cap stocks were victims of the broad-market selloff last week, they hold up much better than the larger ones. This is because small-cap stocks have less international exposure and generate most of their revenues from the domestic market. These pint-sized stocks are less vulnerable to a trade war or any other political issue and could better insulate investors from Trump’s protectionist stance.Texas-based Conns Inc. (CONN  -  Free Report) could be an intriguing choice given its projected earnings growth of 174.62% for the year (ending January 2019).

This is especially true as these stocks offer the best of both these world’s — safety in the form of payouts and stability in the form of mature companies that are less volatile to the large swings in stock prices.

643,TSN,"Tyson Foods, Inc. (TSN  -  Free Report) has been in the green for a while, courtesy of efforts to keep up with the shift in consumer preference toward protein-packed products. Backed by these initiatives, this leading chicken, meat and prepared foods producer has delivered sturdy year-on-year top-line growth in the trailing four quarters. Notably, strong volumes and solid performance across all segments, primarily Beef and Chicken benefitted the company in fourth-quarter fiscal 2017.Driven by such upsides, shares of the company have gained 32.4% in the past six months compared with the industry’s rally of 25.7%.In fact, Tyson Foods has also been focusing on tapping into alternative sources of protein, other than meat and chicken products.  Per media sources, the company recently raised its stake in the California-based company, Beyond Meat. The investment is part of Beyond Meat’s latest fundraising round. We note that Tyson Foods already owns a 5% stake in this plant-based protein manufacturing company.  Let’s take a look into how Tyson Foods can reap benefits from this latest deal as well as other factors that have been driving the company’s performance.Beyond Meat to Drive Growth in Meat Substitute MarketAlongside the widening demography of protein-savvy consumers, traditional meat sales face intense pressure due to increasing environmental concerns about intensive animal farming and animal welfare. Moreover, rising health consciousness amongst consumers have led to a general perception that plant-based products are healthier than meat and chicken.Such market trends have urged companies like Beyond Meat and MorningStar Farms, owned by the leading cereal producer Kellogg (K  -  Free Report), to foray into the animal-free market and develop substitutes for meat and chicken products. Beyond Meat manufactures plant-based burger patties, non-GMO soy, heat-and-eat meals and pea protein frozen foods. The company sells products through grocery chains such as Amazon.com (AMZN  -  Free Report), Kroger (KR  -  Free Report), Whole Foods and Albertsons. The products are also served at leading restaurant chains and hotels.Beyond Meat’s wide-spread market reach in the meat substitute market is undoubtedly a significant value-addition for Tyson Foods. Further, sources revealed that annual sales of meat substitute products, including frozen and shelf-stable products, are expected to reach $863 million in the United States by 2021. Considering the rapid growth of the meat substitutes market, Tyson Foods’ strategy to strengthen presence of this segment bodes well.Strength in the Meat & Chicken SegmentApart from expanding in the meat-substitutes space, Tyson Foods is also progressing well with traditional meat categories. Notably, Tyson Foods’ chicken and beef segments have been depicting strong volume growth since the past few quarters owing to surging consumer demand. Further, in order to expand protein-packed portfolio, the company has been focusing on acquisitions. In this regard, the company’s AdvancePierre buyout favorably impacted the Prepared Foods segment’s performance in the last two quarters. To further enrich the Prepared Foods category, the company announced the buyout of Original Philly Holdings in November 2017. Going forward, management continues to expect positive synergies from acquisitions.In addition to such efforts, Tyson Foods has been expanding poultry production capacity in Tennessee. The company has been proactively catering to consumer’s preference for natural and fresh meat offerings without any added hormones or antibiotics.We believe that such efforts to strengthen foothold in the meat and meat substitute markets, is likely to spur further growth for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

644,TSN,"On Aug 16, shares of The Procter & Gamble Company (PG  -  Free Report), also referred to as Procter & Gamble or P&G, rallied to a new 52-week high of $92.95. The stock pulled back to end the trading session on Wednesday at $92.44.This consumer goods giant, with a market cap of around $235.11 billion, has seen its shares rise roughly 10% so far this year, almost in line with the 10.3% increase for the S&P 500 over the same period. However, the company’s shares have underperformed the industry so far this year.Although P&G shares have underperformed the industry, estimates are trending upward for the last 30 days, hinting analysts’ optimism about the company. P&G also beat earnings estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 4.52%.What’s Driving P&G?Although weak sales have been offsetting margin improvement from pricing gains and cost cuts for some time now, P&G is investing in its brands and products as well as re-designing the supply chain to boost productivity and organic growth.This is evident from its fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results that were released late last month. P&G’s earnings and revenues surpassed expectations in its fiscal fourth quarter. Adjusted earnings increased 8% year over year but net sales remained unchanged from the year-ago level.The earnings growth was encouraging in light of solid organic sales growth and operating margin expansion (up 210 basis points or bps) aided by productivity cost savings (up 350 bps). SG&A expenses, as a percentage of sales, were also down 220 bps aided by cost savings.Overall organic sales were up 2% comprising 2% volume growth. All five business segments achieved organic volume growth despite deceleration in market growth. P&G’s online organic sales also improved 30% and represent over 5% of total revenue.The company remains focused on balanced growth through improved product, packaging, and marketing initiatives and productivity cost-saving plan. the company expects to generate up to an additional $10 billion of cost savings over the next five years (fiscal 2017-2021) in areas including supply chain and cost of goods sold or COGS, marketing and digitization, and promotional spend effectiveness.The $10 billion cost-saving plan comprises $7 billion in COGS savings ($4.5 billion from raw and packaging materials, $1.5 billion in manufacturing savings and $1 billion from transportation/warehousing/other), $2 billion of marketing cost reductions, $1.5 billion of trade spending savings (10% efficiency), and $1–$2 billion of additional overhead reductions. This brings the total potential savings to $12–$13 billion, higher than the $10 billion level. However, P&G adjusted the level down to up to $10 billion to take into account the uncertainty associated with it, especially when projecting out several years.The company continues to focus on product and packaging, superior execution of communications, in-store fundamentals, and consumer value. Hence, the company’s investments in promising innovation and go-to-market capabilities allow it to expand in more categories, geographies and channels, thus bolstering top and bottom-line growth.Zacks Rank & Key PicksProcter & Gamble currently holds a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked stock from the same sector is Unilever N.V.

649,TSN,"Tyson Foods, Inc. (TSN  -  Free Report) is slated to report third-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Aug 7, before the opening bell. The question lingering in investors’ minds is, whether this meat processor will be able to post a positive earnings surprise again in the to-be-reported quarter. The company’s earnings have outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 2.75%. In fact, it has posted positive earnings surprise in seven out of 13 straight quarters.Let us see how things are shaping up for this announcement.What Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Our proven model shows that Tyson Foods is likely to beat earnings because it has the right combination of two key ingredients.Zacks Earnings ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is +3.15%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is $1.31 per share, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.27. This is very meaningful and a leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise for shares. You may uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Tyson Foods currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Note that stocks with Zacks Ranks #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) and 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating estimates. Conversely, Sell-rated stocks (#4 and 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.The combination of Tyson Foods’ Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of +3.15% makes us very optimistic about a possible earnings beat.Which Way are Estimates Treading?Let’s look at the estimate revisions in order to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company right before earnings release. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter and fiscal year 2017 have improved significantly in the last seven days. While estimates for the third quarter moved up 4.1%, it increased 2.6% for fiscal year. In fact, the current Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.27 and $5.19 for the third quarter and fiscal 2017 reflects year-over-year growth of 5.4% and 18.2%, respectively.Moreover, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $9.48 billion for the said quarter, up 0.8% from the year-ago quarter. Also, revenues for fiscal 2017 are projected to grow 1.2% to $37.3 billion.Tyson Foods, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Tyson Foods, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Tyson Foods, Inc. QuoteFactors at PlayTyson Foods remains on track to shape its robust portfolio of food products. The company has been making efforts to expand its protein-packed brands through solid innovation and brand-building efforts. The acquisition of AdvancePierre (completed on Jun 8), divestment of non-protein businesses (Sara Lee Frozen Bakery, Kettle and Van’s), and focus on growth categories and channels are in line with the company’s strategy to expand its protein-packed brands.However, we believe sluggishness in beef segment due to higher domestic availability of fed cattle supplies and lower livestock costs have been hurting the stock. Higher investments in the prepared foods category as well as higher wages are also increasing the expense burden of the company and thereby pressurizing margins.Nevertheless, Tyson Foods is streamlining its organizational structure across its Chicken, Pork, Beef and Prepared Foods segments in order to boost their efficiency and maximize growth. The company’s strong position in chicken segment and its efforts to innovate and offer nutritious products to health-conscious consumers, also remain encouraging. We note that currently, Tyson consumer brand products offer chicken with No Antibiotics Ever (NAE), keeping in view consumers preference for healthy products. Thus, it seems that Tyson Foods remains well equipped with the categories that are currently in high demand at the national foodservice chains. Further, the company is set to make significant investments to improve the supply network within the food-service channel. We expect these efforts to reflect in the quarter to be reported.While shares of Tyson Foods have underperformed the industry in the last one month, with stock rising 2.7% in comparison to the industry’s growth of 4.1%, we believe the company’s efforts to expand protein-packed products and offer nutritious products to health-conscious consumers have the potential to drive the stock higher in the near term.Stocks with Favorable Combination Here are some other companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Avon Products, Inc.

650,TSN,"Tyson Foods, Inc. (TSN  -  Free Report) recently announced that it is streamlining its organizational structure in order to maximize growth. This structure is designed across its Chicken, Pork, Beef and Prepared Foods segments to boost their efficiency by taking quick and convenient decisions.Management also said that the segments will be managed by the group presidents in a more efficient manner. These presidents will look after the growth strategy, improve and execute the top-class officials in all the product groups as well as customer channels of the respective segment they cater. Also, they will directly report to Tom Hayes, Tyson Foods’ president and CEO. Additionally, Sally Grimes, Doug Ramsey and Noel White have been appointed to supervise Prepared Foods, Poultry, and Fresh Meats (Beef and Pork) & International, respectively.The streamlining operation is in sync with the company’s growth strategy, announced in Feb 2017, where the company focused on growing its portfolio of protein-packed brands and invest in innovation. The company had also pointed that all its Tyson consumer brand products would contain chicken with No Antibiotics Ever (NAE).  Tyson Foods’ Strategies and ConcernsTyson Foods remains on track to shape its robust portfolio of food products. The company has been making efforts to expand its protein-packed brands through solid innovation and brand-building efforts. The recent acquisition of AdvancePierre Foods will enable the buyer to flourish in the fastest growing portfolio of protein packed brands, and expand its fresh prepared foods offering for both out-of-home and in-home eating occasions. The company acquired all the outstanding shares of AdvancePierre Foods for approximately $4.2 billion. Going forward, it expects the transaction to generate cost synergies of approximately $200 million within three years.The company’s strong position in chicken segment and, its efforts to innovate and offer nutritious products to health-conscious consumers, remain encouraging. Also, management is taking steps to make a sustainable food system by healthier food and relatables, and in turn, serve the best food to its customers worldwide.However, Tyson Foods has been witnessing sluggishness at its Beef segment, mainly owing to higher domestic availability of fed cattle supplies and lower livestock costs. Additionally, higher investments in the prepared foods category as well as higher wages are increasing the expense burden of the company, thereby pressurizing margins.This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock increased 3.2% year to date, compared with its industry’s gain of 6.6%.

651,TSN,"Despite the fact that input costs are on the rise across the industry with additional capacity only likely to increase these costs further, there are some food stocks with something unique to offer that make them Strong Buys (Zacks Rank #1). (You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here).Since I’ve chosen a motley crowd, including a specialty foods supplier, a frozen foods supplier and a couple of meat producers, it’s hard to get into industry specifics. Suffice it to say that not all food companies are created equal. So there are opportunities in the space that we can tap into.  McCormick & Company, Inc. (MKC  -  Free Report)McCormick & Co is a global leader in the manufacture, marketing and distribution of spices, herbs, seasonings, flavorings and other specialty food products. The company also, through subsidiary corporations, manufactures and markets specialty plastic bottles and tubes for food, personal care and other industries.The factors pressuring the market include rising input costs, increasing private label competition particularly given Amazon’s Whole Foods acquisition and, in McCormick’s case, also high (although manageable) financial leverage. Finally, there was the acquisition of Reckitt Benckiser’s food division, including Frank's Red Hot and French's mustard that required it to both issue fresh shares (so dilution) and additional debt (so increased leverage).But there are also factors working in its favor, including the benefits from the acquisition such as market consolidation and therefore increased negotiating power with retailers, scope for international expansion and management’s stated goal of bringing down the leverage over the next three years with the resultant positive impact on earnings. The acquisition aside, McCormick enjoys a coveted position in the specialty foods space because it sells spices, use of which is likely to increase as against sugary or salty foods sold by others, usage of which is coming down. It therefore enjoys some pricing power.The industrial business is a nice complement to the consumer business and provides a hedge because it generates stronger growth off a smaller base of more diverse customers. The company also shows a slow and steady earnings growth rate, which helps it pay a nice dividend year upon year. The company is expected to grow revenue 9.3% in 2017 and less than 11.5% in 2018. It is expected to grow earnings 10.9% and 10.8%, respectively, this year and next. The current quarter earnings estimate is up 4.2%. The 2017 estimate is up 2.7% and 2018 estimate is up 4.3% in the last 60 days. The company topped estimates in each of the last four quarters at an average rate of 4.0%.Nomad Foods (NOMD  -  Free Report)Feltham, UK-based Nomad Foods Ltd. manufactures and distributes frozen foods primarily in the United Kingdom, Italy, Germany, Sweden, France and Norway. The company's portfolio of frozen food brands includes Birds Eye, Iglo and Findus, which it acquired over the last few years.Nomad’s strategy is to grow through acquisitions. It typically focuses resources on 4-5 categories in each country, in which it seeks to command significant market share and generate strong gross margins. These categories are, by definition, its “must-win battles,” attracting the bulk of R&D, advertising and promotion money. Another group comprising 10-20% of revenue gets some R&D but no advertising money. The rest of the business is managed for cost and allowed to die a natural death where necessary. The company is expected to grow revenue 6.7% in 2017 and less than 1% in 2018. It is expected to grow earnings 19.6% and 17.7%, respectively, this year and next. The earnings estimate for the December quarter is up 33.3%. The 2017 estimate is up 11.1% and 2018 estimate is up 18.2% in the last 60 days.Tyson Foods (TSN  -  Free Report)Tyson Foods is the world's largest fully-integrated producer, processor and marketer of chicken and poultry-based food products. Tyson is a comprehensive supplier of value-added chicken products through food service, retail grocery stores, club stores and international distribution channels. Although its core business is chicken, in the U.S., Tyson is also the second largest maker of corn and flour tortillas under the Mexican Original brand and through its subsidiary Cobb Vantress, the top chicken breeding stock supplier.The meat production industry is highly competitive although Tyson, along with a few others command leading market share. All the top meat producers have extensive chicken processing operations, so they have been impacted by regulatory scrutiny on price fixing charges. It’s also true that for whatever reason, chicken prices have been robust, helping these companies.The other factor is demand, which is based on increased consumption across the world, especially by the growing middle class in developing countries that will account for most of the growth. The USDA estimates that broiler meat production will grow 1% this year partly because of numerous outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) across Asia, Africa, Europe, Russia and the U.S. as offset by the growing demand for low-cost animal protein. Given the low production growth rate, companies with a broad product range, distribution capacity/relationships are likely to be more successful (provided they can also find a way to keep costs down).It’s also been reported that major distributors/grocers like Costco are starting their own poultry operations, which may have an impact on the big meat producers and can also hurt their margins.Tyson also generates some revenue from other meats like beef that while generating lower margins, result in steadier volumes. China lifting the beef ban is a positive in this respect, which along with continued strength in domestic demand are good for its results.Tyson has consistently grown revenues in each of the last 10 years barring 2016. That trend is already reversing this year. Gross profits, EBIT, EBITDA and net income have also moved up steadily, particularly after 2014. With cost savings from the AdvancePierre integration, supply chain improvements and elimination of 450 management positions across three locations yet to kick in, the company is likely to see margin expansion. The recent spike in the debt level may help finance the Kansas chicken processing plant it’s planning to build.Tyson’s surprise history hasn’t been anything to write home about, with the company missing estimates almost as frequently as it beat. But it’s encouraging that its earnings estimates are showing an upward trend. Accordingly, estimates for 2017 and 2018 are up 1% and 6.8%, respectively. Overall earnings are expected to be up 17.0% this year and 7.3% in 2018 despite much slower revenue growth expectations.Pilgrim's Pride Corp. (PPC  -  Free Report)Pilgrim's Pride is one of the largest chicken companies in the U.S., Mexico and Puerto Rico. The company's fresh chicken retail line is sold throughout the U.S., throughout Puerto Rico, and in the northern and central regions of Mexico. Its prepared chicken products are sold to some of the largest customers in the food service industry across the US. Additionally, commodity chicken products are exported to over 90 countries.Being a vertically integrated company, it controls every phase of the production including feed mills, hatcheries, processing plants and distribution centers across the U.S., Puerto Rico and Mexico. This helps it to keep costs down.The company recently acquired JBS-owned Moy Park, which has extensive operations in the UK from where it sources its chickens. These are mostly sold to supermarkets and quick service restaurants in the UK and Ireland itself although some of the production is also sold to European countries. So the acquisition enables expansion into the European market through a local player. This is perfect in terms of acceptance (local brand), geographical diversification (an important market in Europe) and cost savings (costs to be eliminated on integration of Moy Park will be around $50 million).People’s Pride’s revenue shows an upward trend over the last ten years. While 2015 and 2016 could have been better, 2017 is shaping up to be a good year with the revenue growth returning. The profitability ratios tell the same story. Moreover, 2017 estimates have jumped 98% and 2018 estimated have jumped over 10% in the last 60 days. The surprise ratio has been generally disappointing, but there was a positive (turning point?) in the last quarter.   Wrapping UpWhile each of these companies have a strong market position and factors supporting steady growth over the long term, it’s worth noting that they are all trading at a premium to the industry. So while some may fear downside risk, the fact remains that these are stocks that we may want to accumulate.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - Q1 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 11X over. Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we're willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation.See Them Free>>

652,TSN,"The Senate has finally passed the budget blueprint for fiscal 2018, ironing out difficulties in the path of President Trump’s historic tax reform plan. Trump believes that such an opportunity to benefit the middle class by slashing corporate tax rates comes once in a lifetime. Markets rallied after this development as investors believe that a tax cut will boost the U.S. economy over the long term.Tax Reforms to Boost GDPThe latest report from Trump’s Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) reveals that the new tax plan will drive the economy to new heights. According to the report, a cut in the corporate tax rate from 35% to 20% will lift the annual GDP growth rate to as high as 5%; the projected range lies between 3% and 5%.As per Business Insider, the U.S. GDP growth rate was 7.4% in 1984, after which it never touched 5%. In fact, since 1980, the rate crossed the 4.5% mark only thrice. It should be noted that with a lower corporate tax rate, companies will accumulate more disposable income to invest in the domestic market and thereby create more jobs. This will pave the way for further economic growth.Tech & Bank Bigwigs Set to GainAccording to Moody's, as much as $1.3 trillion in cash has been stored by U.S. firms overseas in order to avoid paying the stiff corporate tax rate. The five top cash hoarders in the country — Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report), Microsoft Corp. (MSFT  -  Free Report), Alphabet Inc. , Cisco Systems, Inc  and Oracle Corp. (ORCL  -  Free Report)  — have stockpiled 88% of their cash outside the country, notes CNNMoney. A cut in rates will encourage these companies to repatriate cash, boosting the U.S. economy substantially.Banks also bear a huge tax burden. Among all the sectors representing the S&P 1500 index, financials contribute 25% of tax liabilities, per KBW Research. The investment banking firm believes that the tax rate cut will help Bank of America Corp. (BAC  -  Free Report), JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report) and Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report) boost their earnings by 20%.Per Howard Silverblatt of S&P Dow Jones Indices, the consumer staples sector paid the second highest taxes in the S&P 500 index last year — at a rate of 29.1%. Thus, lower taxes will massively benefit consumer staples companies like Tyson Foods, Inc. (TSN  -  Free Report), Unilever PLC (UN  -  Free Report) and Sysco Corp.  (SYY  -  Free Report). Tyson Foods sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Tax Plan Might Increase Debt BurdenThere has been a prolonged debate on whether the baby boomers generation will become a major burden for the Social Security system. Baby boomers are all those who were born between 1946 and 1964, accumulating almost 76 million people at present, according to media resources. Media reports also claim that this generation will make it to the list of full retirement benefits by 2031.Meanwhile, CNBC claims that Trump’s tax reform will lower revenues by $1.5 trillion in the next 10 years for the U.S. government. Investors should know that, according to The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, out of $3.9 trillion spent in fiscal 2016, more than $3.3 trillion was funded by the government. Hence, only a nominal amount was borrowed.However, in the coming years, the government will need to borrow more to support Social Security. In other words, Trump’s tax plan to stimulate the domestic economy will increase the debt burden considerably, raising questions about its sustainability.Zacks’ Best Private Investment IdeasWhile we are happy to share many articles like this on the website, our best recommendations and most in-depth research are not available to the public.Starting today, for the next month, you can follow all Zacks' private buys and sells in real time.

653,TSN,"The consumer staples sector has been on a growth trajectory since the beginning of the year, on the back of improved economic scenario buoyed by rising consumer confidence, which is a key determinant of the economy’s health. Although consumer confidence declined marginally in September due to hurricane Harvey and Irma’s impact in Texas and Florida, we believe the economic conditions are quite favorable and indicate that the economy will continue to grow in the near term.The improving economy was also supported by labor market optimism and the recent gross domestic product (GDP) rate provided by the Commerce Department in consumer spending for the second quarter 2017. The commerce department stated that GDP rose 3.1% in the second quarter of 2017, the highest in two years. The recent tax cut proposal proposed by President Trump further instills confidence.However, we understand that the U.S. economy is not fully immune to global uncertainties, which could limit growth potential. But the encouraging data as well as the new tax reforms reflects that the economy is in good shape and the spending power is likely to increase going forward. This is also well reflected in the three key U.S. indexes, which have closed in positive territory so far this year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average increased 13.0%. The S&P 500 rose 11.9%, while Nasdaq grew 20.3% on a year-to-date basis.How Will Investors Gain From This Scenario?At this moment, investors must be looking for those stocks that have been gaining momentum and are expected to outpace market’s performance in the coming months. Rightly, momentum investing can prove to be a winning strategy for investors seeking higher returns in a short span. We believe that the bullish projections present significant growth opportunity for momentum investors.  This strategy mainly suggests capturing profits by buying stocks that have witnessed an uptrend in the past few weeks or months. It is based on the idea that once a stock establishes a trend, it is more likely to continue in that direction than drift away from the trajectory.Here we have highlighted few consumer staple stocks, which have outperformed the market’s performance so far this year. Further, these stocks carry a Momentum Score of either A or B along with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.7 Prominent PicksThe Ridgefield, CT-based The Chefs' Warehouse, Inc.

654,TSN,"SUPERVALU Inc. (SVU  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Jul 25, before the market opens.The question lingering in investors’ minds is, whether this leading grocery dealer will be able to deliver positive earnings surprise in the to-be-reported quarter. Its earnings have lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters, with an average miss of 6.7%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.What Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Our proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for SUPERVALU this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP for this to happen.SuperValu Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  SuperValu Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | SuperValu Inc. QuoteSUPERVALU has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 10 cents. The company has a Zacks Rank #2, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, its ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult. You may uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Which Way are Estimates Treading?Let’s look at the estimate revisions in order to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company right before earnings release. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of 10 cents for the fiscal first quarter has been stable in the last 30 days and reflects year-over-year decline of 47.4% from 19 cents posted in the year-ago quarter. However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 35 cents for fiscal 2018 shows growth from 29 cents delivered in fiscal 2017.Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $3.98 billion and $12.85 billion for the impending quarter and fiscal 2018, which are 23.5% and 14.2% lower than the respective year-ago periods.Factors at PlayWe note that SUPERVALU has been witnessing difficulties in delivering growth, of late. In fact, the company has been reporting lower-than-expected sales for the last few quarters, primarily due to soft comparable store-sales. Evidently, its top line has lagged estimates for seven of the last nine quarters.In addition, this leading grocery dealer is witnessing sluggish sales in the retail business due to tough competitive pressure, lower store traffic and deflationary environment in the food industry. Notably, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, retail sales fell 3.2% year over year with same-store sales remaining negative at 5.8%, thereby marking the eighth consecutive quarter of decline.We note that the food/grocery industry is grappling with a number of headwinds of late. Shift in consumer purchase decisions, evolving shopping behavior and increasing presence of small firms continue to plague the industry. Moreover, the fact that SUPERVALU is not completely immune to the industry’s headwinds, have been denting its financial results.Nonetheless, management at SUPERVALU is striving hard to spark a turnaround and return to its growth trajectory. The company is also geared to expand its retail banners in order to boost sales, along with the intent to capitalize on the private brands portfolio among the retail banners. Moreover, it is trying all means to rejuvenate its retail segment, reduce costs and increase operating efficiency.We commend SUPERVALU’s efforts to develop the wholesale operations, primarily through adding new customers, retaining and developing business with existing customers and acquisitions. In fact, the recent acquisition of Unified Grocers is expected to radically boost the company’s wholesale segment, alongside offering new growth opportunities across multiple geographies. Its wholesale business will drive the momentum further and boost its near-term results.Notably, SUPERVALU’s shares have rallied 10% in the last one month against the Zacks categorized Food – Miscellaneous/Diversified industry’s decline of 2.8%. Meanwhile, the broader Consumer Staples sector fell 0.3%.Per the latest Earnings Outlook, total second-quarter 2017 earnings for the sector are expected to rise 3.9%, while revenues are projected to improve 1.5%. In fact, we observed that the Consumer Staples sector has lagged the broader market in the last one year. While the Zacks categorized sector gained 1.1%, the S&P 500 index advanced 13.5%.Stocks with Favorable CombinationHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:The Clorox Company (CLX  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.67% and a Zacks Rank #2.

657,TSN,"Tyson Foods Inc. (TSN  -  Free Report) hogged into limelight after it increased fiscal 2017 earnings guidance on Sep 28 and announced restructuring initiatives to strengthen its business to drive profits. The producer of chicken and poultry-based food products now expects fiscal 2017 bottom line to be in the range of $5.20-$5.30 per share, higher than its prior guidance of $4.95-$5.05.Meanwhile, management expects favorable market conditions to continue to boost its financials in fiscal 2018 and projects earnings in the range of $5.70-$5.85, reflecting year-over-year growth of 8-13%. We believe continued focus on protein-rich brands and cost savings are driving the company’s profitability.Evidently, shares of the company have been on a growth trajectory over the past three months. In the said time frame, the company’s shares have increased 18.9% compared with the industry’s rise of 14.2%. In fact, Tyson Foods’ shares have increased more than 8% since it raised earnings guidance. Tyson Foods also flaunts a VGM Score of A, which makes it a favorable investing option.Let’s delve deeper and try to find out what’s taking this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company higher.Focus on High Protein BrandsTyson Foods has been witnessing earnings growth courtesy of its improved sales performance. Notably, the company delivered higher sales volumes driven by increased demand for high protein foods. The acquisition of AdvancePierre acquisition, which was carried out in June, will enable the company to expand its fastest-growing portfolio of protein-packed brands and fresh prepared foods offerings.While Tyson Foods is restructuring its portfolio to focus more on protein-rich brands, it’s exiting its non-core businesses (such as Sara Lee Frozen Bakery, Kettle and Van’s) to focus on protein-packed brands and drive sales.Improved performance of the company’s Beef segment, backed by enhanced domestic demand, improved availability of cattle supply and higher exports, is also fueling sales. The company is also witnessing higher demand for chicken and pork, which is expected to drive Tyson Foods’ top line.In fact, management expects sales growth across all of its business segments buoyed by rising consumption, easy availability of livestock and higher pricing.Cost SavingsMeanwhile, cost savings is further boosting earnings momentum. Tyson Foods expects to generate cost savings of $200 million, $400 million, and $600 million in fiscal 2018, 2019, and 2020, respectively, through the AdvancePierre acquisition.Also, the company is seeking to reinventing its supply-chain and procurement process and lowering overhead costs to boost savings. These cost savings are expected to improve the performance of Tyson Foods’ Chicken and Prepared Foods segments. Meanwhile, to streamline its management, the company would slash 450 jobs from corporate offices in Chicago, Springdale, and Cincinnati.We expect that the company’s dedicated efforts toward inducing operational efficiency and reducing costs to improve margins and thereby profits in the forthcoming months.Innovation Aids Portfolio GrowthTyson Foods continuously innovates and adds products to an already rich food line up. As an increasing number of health-conscious U.S. consumers are focusing on nutritious breakfasts, Tyson Foods considers it a high potential category. Recent launches like Jimmy Dean Frittatas, Stuffed Hash Browns, Tyson Food Service Fully Cooked Drumsticks and Buffalo Chicken Crispitos are getting good response from consumers.Valuation MultiplesIf we look into the company’s P/E, EV/EBITDA and P/S multiples, we note that the company generally trades below its industry average.Tyson Foods has a trailing P/E multiple of 14.8 and EV/EBITDA multiple of 10.0. This level actually compares pretty favorably with the industry at large, as the P/E multiple and EV/EBITDA multiple for the industry is pegged at 16.0 and 11.2, respectively. These are also trading below S&P 500 levels of 20.6 and 11.4, respectively. This indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to the industry and S&P 500.Currently, Tyson Foods has a P/S ratio of 0.7. This is also lower than the industry average of 1.1 and S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.2. Valuation MultipleTyson FoodsIndustryS&P 500P/E ratio (ttm)14.816.020.6P/S ratio0.71.13.2EV/EBITDA10.011.211.4Looking for More?

658,TSN,"Today I'm going over a simple screen with a powerful concept:  
"
659,TSN,"Buying stocks making new highs.  
"
660,TSN,"I know some are reluctant to buy stocks making new 52-week highs. If you're one of them, have you ever asked yourself why?  
"
661,TSN,"If a stock is making a new 52-week high, isn't that a good thing? Just like a stock making a new 52-week low is a bad thing.  
"
662,TSN,"I'm pretty sure that a person who dislikes buying stocks making new 52-week highs wouldnt be too upset if the stock he already owned broke out to a new 52-week high.  
"
663,TSN,"And why should he? Statistics have shown that stocks making new highs have a tendency of making even higher highs.  
"
664,TSN,"These are the stocks we all dream about being in. Get in and it keeps going up.  
"
665,TSN,"Of course the fundamentals need to be there. And you should keep a watchful eye on valuations. But if you were in a stock making new highs and cheering it on, it seems silly to be afraid of one doing the same just because you haven't bought it.
"
666,TSN,"One question I like asking myself just to put things into perspective is: If I was in it, would I be excited and would I still want to be in it? If the answer is yes, then I'll look for the best opportunity to get in.  
"
667,TSN,"If the answer is no, I'd want to take profits, then I'll move on.  
"
668,TSN,"This topic actually reminds me of a question someone asked me a while ago about a stock I was talking about that was at a new 52-week high. In fact, it was at a 5-year high.  
"
669,TSN,"He asked, ""Aren't you worried about buying a stocks at a 52-week high?"" I said of course not. So it just made a new 52-week high. That's great news. Guess what - last year it made a new 52-week high as well. And the year before that. And the year before that.  
"
670,TSN,"Can you imagine all the money you'd be leaving on the table if you were afraid of being in stocks every time they made a new high?  
"
671,TSN,"Case closed.  
"
672,TSN,":)
"
673,TSN,"The screen I'm running today looks for: Stock trading within 5% of their 52 week high
"
674,TSN,"The expression looks like this: Current Price/52 Week high greater than or equal to .95  
"
675,TSN,"That means these stocks are either at a new 52-week high, have just hit it and are still trading within 5% of it, or are climbing towards their 52-week high and are within striking distance. Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2

677,TSN,"A Price to Sales ratio of 1 means you're paying $1 for every $1 of sales a company makes. A P/S ratio of less than 1 means you're paying less than $1 for every $1 of sales a company makes. I have found that by looking at stocks with a P/S ratio of less than or equal to 1 helps me find stocks that are still considered undervalued - even if they are making new highs.

682,TSN,"Molson Coors Brewing Co. (TAP  -  Free Report) is set to report second-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Aug 2. The question lingering in investors’ minds is, whether this beverage company will be able to post a positive earnings surprise in the to-be-reported quarter. It should be noted that the company has posted three negative earnings surprises in the last four quarters, resulting in an average negative surprise of 22.6%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to the announcement.What Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Our proven model shows that Molson Coors is likely to beat earnings because it has the right combination of two key ingredients.Zacks Earnings ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is +4.90%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is $2.14, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged lower at $2.04. A favorable Zacks ESP serves as a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise.  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Molson Coors currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Note that stocks with Zacks Ranks #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) and 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings. Conversely, the Sell-rated stocks ( Zacks Rank #4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.The combination of Molson Coors’ Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of +4.90% makes us very optimistic about a possible earnings beat.Which Way Are Estimates Trending?Let’s look at the estimate revisions in order to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company right before earnings release. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the second quarter and 2017 has been declining over the last seven days. However, the current Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.04 per share and $6.45 for the second quarter and full-year 2017 reflect year-over-year growth of 83.8% and 103.4%, respectively.Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $3.08 billion for the said quarter, up 212.7% from the year-ago period. For 2017, Zacks consensus revenue is pegged at $11.1 billion, reflecting a 127.6% year-over-year increase.Molson Coors Brewing Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Molson Coors Brewing Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Molson Coors Brewing Company QuoteFactors to Consider Molson Coors has been struggling with weak sales volume trend of late. While the acquisition of the Miller global brands helped improving sales in the International regions, sales volume continued to decline in Canada and Europe. A difficult economy, unfavorable currency and competitive pressure remained the major deterrents. The company’s dismal performance is reflected in its share price. Molson Coors’ shares have fallen 12.3% in the last one year, in comparison to the industry’s growth of 2.4%. In order to revive its performance, Molson Coors has been focusing on expanding its foothold through strategic agreements and targeting above-premium brands to help grow its market share.The recent agreement with Hornell Brewing Co., Inc., an affiliate of AriZona Beverages, is in line with Molson Coors’ current business expansion initiatives. The deal will give Molson Coors the license to market and distribute a new Flavored Malt Beverage (FMB) brand, Arnold Palmer Spiked Half & Half, through its U.S. division MillerCoors. This would aid Molson Coors to capture the momentum of ready-to-drink teas (both alcoholic and non-alcoholic) in the U.S.In regard to its cost savings target, the company exceeded its 2016 goal by achieving more than $165 million of in-year cost reductions. The acquisition of the remaining 58% stake in MillerCoors will also drive substantial cost synergies in the next three years and continues to expect this transaction to be significantly accretive to underlying earnings in the first full year of operations. This will also help the company to drive top-line growth, profit, cash generation, debt pay-down and total shareholder returns in the years ahead. The company expects cost savings of $550 million over the next three years till 2019.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:The Clorox Company (CLX  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.67% and a Zacks Rank #2.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter and fiscal year depict a year-over-year decline of 11.1% and 0.9%, respectively.

This has encouraged management to schedule the launch of ageLOC LumiSpa product in the fourth quarter of 2017 that is expected to generate roughly $100 million in revenues. Moreover, the company has also been witnessing robust growth in the Mainland China, South Asia/Pacific and EMEA regions. Further, Nu Skin remains on track with its innovations and product launches which will boost sales and expand customer base.However, currency headwind remains a major concern for the company, which is expected to hurt second-quarter revenues in between 1–2% range.Still Interested in Consumer Staples Stocks?

684,TSN,"Spectrum Brands Holdings, Inc. (SPB  -  Free Report) is all set to report third-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Jul 27, before the opening bell.The question lingering in investors’ minds is, whether this leading consumer products company will be able to come up with a positive earnings surprise in the to-be-reported quarter. The company’s earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5.6% in the fiscal second quarter. However, it has delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 0.7% in the trailing four quarters.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.What Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Our proven model does not conclusively show earnings beat for Spectrum Brands this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP for this to happen. You may uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Spectrum Brands Holdings, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Spectrum Brands Holdings, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Spectrum Brands Holdings, Inc. QuoteSpectrum Brands has an Earnings ESP of -1.56%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is at $1.89, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged higher at $1.92. Although the company’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP, we need a positive Earnings ESP in order to be confident about an earnings surprise.What to Expect?Let’s look at the estimate revisions in order to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company right before earnings release. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.92 and $5.82 for the fiscal third quarter and fiscal 2017, respectively, has declined by two cents each in the last seven days.Furthermore, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $1.38 billion and $5.08 billion for the said quarter and the fiscal year, respectively.Per the latest Earnings Preview, the earnings growth for the Consumer Staples sector looks decent. While total earnings for the sector are estimated to rise 3.1%, revenues are projected to improve 1.2%.Factors Influencing the QuarterSpectrum Brands’ shares have declined 14% in the last three months, wider than the industry’s loss of 3.1%. In contrast, the Zacks categorized Consumer Staples sector gained 2% and is currently placed at top 13% of the Zacks Classified sectors (2 out of 16).We note that the company’s top line has lagged estimates in four of the last seven quarters, including the last reported quarter. Moreover, its sales have been declining since the last three quarters, primarily due to soft sales recorded at the Global Batteries & Appliances, Global Pet Supplies and Global Auto Care segments. In fact, sales decreased 3.3% and 0.6% in the second and first quarters of fiscal 2017, respectively. The same had slumped 4.5% in the final quarter of fiscal 2016.Further, Spectrum Brands continues to battle adverse foreign currency effects, which is likely to mar its results in the near term. Management expects net sales for fiscal 2017 to include about 100–150 basis points impact from currency headwinds.However, on the positive front, we remain encouraged by the company’s innovative products in all categories and persistent leverage of its global infrastructure and shared services. Also, it is making acquisitions and exiting underperforming businesses to improve profitability, margins and free cash flow. So let’s wait and see if Spectrum Brands can counter the hurdles and be able to pull off a positive earnings surprise in the upcoming quarter with these initiatives.Stocks with Favorable CombinationHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:The Clorox Company (CLX  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.67% and a Zacks Rank #2.

685,TSN,"Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc.  is set to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 27, before the market opens.Last quarter, this Texas-based beverage company posted a positive surprise of 5.2%. The company also surpassed estimates in three of the trailing four quarters, resulting in an average positive surprise of 3.44%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Dr Pepper Snapple is likely to beat earnings because it has the perfect combination of two key ingredients.Zacks ESP: Dr Pepper Snapple’s Earnings ESP is +2.36% as the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at $1.30, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is at $1.27. A favorable Zacks ESP serves as a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc Price and EPS Surprise Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc Price and EPS Surprise | Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc QuoteZacks Rank: Dr Pepper Snapple currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings estimates.Conversely, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.The combination of Dr Pepper Snapple’s Zacks Rank #3 and +2.36% ESP makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Factors to ConsiderA look at estimate revisions lends us an idea of analyst expectations right before a company’s earnings release. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter earnings per share declined by a penny in the past 30 days to $1.27. However, this reflects a year-over-year increase of 1.8%. Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $1.77 billion for the said quarter, reflecting a 4.4% increase from a year ago.We are optimistic about Dr Pepper Snapple’s focus on forming distribution agreements with emerging, high-growth third-party brands. These allied brand partnerships allow the company to participate in adjacent and growing categories while also fully tapping into its manufacturing and distribution network. Allied brands have been an important driver of revenues and profits over the past few quarters. The acquisition of Bai Brands is the evidence of its diversification efforts toward lessening its exposure to carbonated soft drinks (“CSD”).Also, the company’s aggressive marketing campaigns, pricing gains, innovation and productivity improvements are expected to boost sales. We are also encouraged by the company’s Rapid Continuous Improvement program through which it has been able to reduce inventory and storage costs and improve cash flows.The company earlier notified that marketing expenses, excluding Bai Brands, is expected to increase by about $20 million in the second quarter. Also, it expected about a $5-million increase in health, welfare and risk insurance in the second quarter.We are concerned about the week carbonated beverages volume trends and persistent pressure from adverse foreign currency movement. Cross-category competition and growing health and wellness consciousness are hurting CSD category growth. Foreign currency headwind is expected to impact core EPS by 7 cents in 2017, primarily because of the Mexican peso. Again, foreign currency translation is likely to dent overall 2017 revenue growth by approximately 1%.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are some other companies in the Consumer Staple sector you may want to consider as our model shows that these also have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Tyson Foods, Inc.

686,TSN,"The Procter & Gamble Company (PG  -  Free Report) is set to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Jul 27, before the market opens. Last quarter, it delivered a positive earnings surprise of 2.13%.In fact, despite sales remaining subdued, the consumer goods company delivered a positive earnings surprise in each of the trailing four quarters, the average being 3.97%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderProcter & Gamble has been struggling for the last few years to boost sales. Notably, the company’s sales declined in the last 13 consecutive quarters. Major foreign exchange headwind, weak volumes, divestitures and slowing market growth have been hurting the company’s sales. Soft consumer-spending environment in developed markets also adds to the worries.The trend is not likely to change for the to-be-reported quarter. Softness in the U.S. and volatility in developing markets will likely have an adverse impact on Procter & Gamble’s results. In fact, categories in the company’s largest and profitable market, the U.S. (accounting for 40% of net sales), grew by less than a point in the fiscal third quarter, a lot lower than the roughly 2% growth registered in the first half of fiscal 2017. Overall, the company posted flat organic sales growth in developed markets.Meanwhile, Procter & Gamble has been taking various restructuring initiatives aimed at generating higher profit and lowering costs. These initiatives have helped the company to accelerate margins growth amid the slowdown in sales. However, fiscal third quarter’s gross as well as operating margins fell despite benefitting from productivity savings. This was due to higher input costs, a planned increase in marketing spending, higher R&D costs, and lower pricing due to increased competition.Hence, lower sales accompanied by higher commodity costs, more investments for marketing and increased R&D spending to push demand might adversely affect margins, thereby putting pressure on bottom line in the to-be-reported quarter. This will be partly offset by cost-saving measures.For the fiscal fourth quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 78 cents, reflecting a decrease of 0.8% year over year. Meanwhile, the consensus estimate for revenues is pegged at $15.98 billion, implying a 0.8% decline.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Procter & Gamble is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. However, that is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Procter & Gamble’s Earnings ESP is 0.00% as the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 78 cents.

688,TSN,"Tyson Foods, Inc (TSN  -  Free Report) has been struggling with higher operating expenses owing to enhanced investments and restructuring initiatives, of late.  Evidently, shares of the company have underperformed the industry in the past six months. In the said time frame, the company’s shares have increased 5.6% compared with the industry’s rise of 10.2%.However, Tyson Foods’ shares have depicted a turnaround recently and increased more than 7% since Sep 28, when it raised fiscal 2017 earnings guidance along with other restructuring initiatives.The company now expects adjusted earnings in the range of $5.20-5.30 per share, significantly higher than the previously anticipated range of $4.95-5.05. Further, the company projects adjusted earnings for fiscal 2018 in the range of $5.70-5.85. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2017 and 2018 are currently pegged lower at $5.09 and $5.35, respectively.The higher earnings expectation for fiscal 2017 is backed by improved performance of the company’s Beef segment. This segment performed strongly during the third quarter of fiscal 2017, backed by enhanced domestic demand, improved availability of cattle supply and higher exports.  Financial Fitness, Job Cuts & Other InitiativesIn addition to improved earnings, Tyson Foods also stated that it would proceed with the implementation of its previously announced Financial Fitness plans, in an effort to induce greater operational efficiencies and create more value for its stakeholders.Management also stated that the company would be adhering to job cuts for about 450 positions, to make the organization more agile and achieve greater financial efficiency. The headcount reductions would mainly be carried out in Chicago, Cincinnati and Springdale. We note that the company has been struggling with higher wage-related costs, owing to hikes to attract and retain efficient workers. Hence, the current job cuts are expected to offer the company considerable reduction in expense burden.The management also expects net synergies of $200 million, $400 million and $600 million from the AdvancePierre acquisition for fiscal 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively. The acquisition, which was carried out in June, is mainly expected to improve the performance of Tyson Foods’ Chicken and Prepared Foods segments.In relation with its ongoing restructuring and improvement initiatives, Tyson Foods expects charges in the range of $140-$150 million to be reported in its fourth-quarter results. The charges mainly include in-process software implementations of approximately $70 million, employee termination costs of $45-$50 million and contract termination costs of $25-$30 million.We expect that this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s dedicated efforts toward inducing operational efficiency and reducing costs to improve margins and boost the stock performance in the forthcoming months.Looking for More Consumer Staples Stocks?

689,TSN,"The food industry has been struggling with rising competition, tight margins and an aggressive promotional environment. Larger food chains are strengthening their position by expanding their franchises and undertaking acquisitions. Moreover, Amazon.com Inc’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) recent takeover of Whole Foods Market has disconcerted major food and grocery retailers. Amazon’s growing strength through such strategic buyouts cut down revenue opportunities for other companies in the industry. While grocery stocks have been under pressure, meat stocks are seen to be doing well, owing to rising consumer demand. One such stock is Tyson Foods, Inc (TSN  -  Free Report) that has been displaying strength due to the rising demand for its protein-packed products.However, we observe that margin pressure and promotional environment has weighed down the company’s shares in the past six months. Shares of Tyson Foods have gained 5.8% compared with the industry’s advance of 8.1%.  Nevertheless, Tyson Foods has undertaken several initiatives to revive its performance. Let’s now delve into some of the aspects that have been impacting this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock.Strong Volume Growth in the Third QuarterTyson Foods’ third-quarter fiscal 2017 results benefitted from strong volume growth and solid performance of its Beef, Pork and Chicken segments. The company’s results were boosted by the rising demand of these products. Notably, the Beef segment was seen to be sluggish in the past. Nevertheless, robust domestic demand for beef products, improved availability of cattle supply and higher exports aided the segment’s growth during the third quarter. Further, for fiscal 2018, the USDA expects overall domestic protein production (chicken, beef, pork and turkey) to increase.Strategic Acquisitions & Focus on Protein Packed Brands Acquisitions have been one of the important growth drivers for Tyson Foods. The successful completion of AdvancePierre acquisition in June 2017, aided Prepared Foods segment sales volume to rise 2.4%, as witnessed in the company’s third-quarter results. Tyson Foods expects the transaction to generate net synergies of approximately $200 million within the next three years. Further, the acquisition will enable the company to expand its fastest-growing portfolio of protein-packed brands and fresh prepared foods offerings. Other notable acquisitions of the company that enabled portfolio diversifying include Hillshire, Circle Foods and Don Julio Foods.Additionally, the acquisition of AdvancePierre and divestment of non-protein businesses (such as Sara Lee Frozen Bakery, Kettle and Van’s) are in-line with the company’s strategy to widen its protein-packed brands. Moreover, consumers are observed to shift away from red meat and opt for chicken, owing to health reasons. Taking advantage of this trend, Tyson Foods has been expanding its poultry plant capacities.Innovation Aids Portfolio Growth Tyson Foods continuously innovates and adds products to an already rich food line up. As an increasing number of health-conscious U.S. consumers are focusing on nutritious breakfasts, Tyson Foods considers it a high potential category. Recent launches like Jimmy Dean Frittatas, Stuffed Hash Browns, Tyson Food Service Fully Cooked Drumsticks and Buffalo Chicken Crispitos are getting good response from consumers.Looking for More?

690,TSN,"The most powerful Atlantic Ocean hurricane, Irma, tore through the French Caribbean island territories, wrecking telecommunications systems and roads. However, Hurricane Irma was comparatively less forceful in Florida and weakened to a Category 1 storm as it made its way across land masses.Notably, the eye of the storm missed Miami and gradually lost its energy once it went across the highly unpopulated Everglades. Hurricane Irma was then downgraded to a tropical storm.Nonetheless, disaster modeling software company — AIR Worldwide — estimates losses stemming from the hurricane to be between $20 billion and $40 billion. Per the Guardian, “the economic cost of Hurricane Irma could rise as high as $300 billion” as it withered households, businesses as well as farms over its course.Hurricane Irma placed producers of hogs and chicken in the United States at risk. Though birds are majorly raised indoors, poultry facilities require steady supply of feed and electricity. In addition, processing related activities of these farms slow down during such calamities, if the animals cannot be promptly transported to safer areas.   Farms Had Braced Up for the WorstThe hog and poultry firms had taken a number of measures to protect the processing facilities and animal herds from the devastating impact of hurricane Irma.The cattlemen at these farms were instructed to open up fences and move up animals to higher grounds or wooden areas, which could offer relief from strong winds. The farms also ensured that the grain bins had additional feed, in case the roads were washed out due to heavy rains.Moreover, these farms made sure that the backup generators of the facilities were equipped with adequate fuel.   However, we notice that certain plants were even shut down on account of the storm severity.Zacks CounselThe three hog and poultry stocks listed below seem to be safe investment bets even in the face of Irma-induced challenges. These stocks not only enjoy bright prospects, but are also currently performing better than the industry average.Pilgrim's Pride Corporation (PPC  -  Free Report) produces, processes and markets frozen, fresh and value-added chicken products. The company distributes these products to retailers and foodservice operators in the United States, Puerto Rico and Mexico.The company currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and carries a VGM Score A.

The company is also trying to reinforce its competency on the back of strategic acquisitions. Constant attempts to launch innovative product categories (like fully cooked sausages under the Gold'n Plump brand) and improved operational efficacy are also anticipated to strengthen the competency of this company in the near term.Sanderson Farms, Inc.

The company announced that its new North Carolina facilities will deliver maximum production in January 2018. In addition, it noted that the construction of the new facility in Texas is slated to commence this September and will further reinforce its aggregate productivity in the quarters ahead.

Furthermore, the acquisition of AdvancePierre (June 2017) is anticipated to fortify the company’s fastest growing portfolio of protein packed and prepared foods brands.

691,TSN,"About a month has gone by since the last earnings report for Tyson Foods, Inc. (TSN  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 3% in that time frame, underperforming the market.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Tyson Foods Beats on Q3 Earnings & Sales Tyson Foods posted better-than-expected third-quarter fiscal 2017 results, wherein both earnings and sales surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The company reported adjusted earnings of $1.28 per share that was marginally ahead of the estimate and increased 6% year over year. The results mainly benefitted from the strong performance of its segments, primarily Beef and Chicken.Revenues and MarginsNet sales increased 4.8% to $9.85 billion primarily due to improvement across all its food segments and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9.48 billion. Sales volume increased 0.5%, while average sales price (ASP) inched up 4.2%.Tyson Foods' adjusted operating income declined 1.4% to $756 million due to higher operating costs. Adjusted operating margin contracted 50 basis points (bps) to 7.7%.Segment Details Chicken: Sales for the segment came in at $2.9 billion. Sales volume increased 1.6% year over year owing to higher demand for chicken products. Average sales price for the quarter increased 2.9% due to change in sales mix. However, adjusted operating margin declined 350 bps to 10.4% due to higher operating costs.Beef: Sales for the segment came in at $4 billion. Sales volume rose 0.4% year over year, owing to robust domestic demand for beef products, improved availability of cattle supply and higher exports. These factors positively impacted the average sales price, which increased 5.3%. Adjusted operating margin expanded 130 basis points to 3.7% on the back of favorable market conditions.Pork: Sales for the segment came in at $1.3 billion. The segment’s sales volume grew 0.6% year over year driven by enhanced exports as well as sturdy demand for pork products. Average sales price increased 3.3%, while adjusted operating margin increased 70 bps to 10.3%, gaining from live hog markets.Prepared Foods: Sales for the segment came in at $1.9 billion. Prepared Foods’ sales volume grew 2.4% due to incremental volumes arising from the buyout of AdvancePierre. These were partly offset by fall in food service. Average sales price was up 4.9% due to favorable product mix arising from the acquisition of AdvancePierre. Adjusted operating margin contracted 90 bps to 10% due to higher operating costs.Other: Sales for the segment came in at $85 million, while volume declined 11.9%. The segment incurred operating loss of $20 million compared with the loss of $23 million in the year-ago period.Other Financial UpdateTyson Foods ended the quarter with a cash and cash equivalent of $231 million, long-term debt of $9.8 billion and shareholders’ equity of $10.1 billion. Further, management projects capital expenditures to be approximately $1 billion for fiscal 2017.GuidanceFor fiscal 2017, Tyson anticipates sales to be over $38 billion, as the company is hopeful regarding improving volumes across all its segments. For Fiscal 2018, it anticipates sales to increase to $41 billion. Tyson Foods envisions fiscal 2017 earnings in the range of $4.95-$5.05 per share, reflecting an increase of 13% year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fiscal year is currently pegged at $5.19.For fiscal 2018, USDA expects overall domestic protein production (chicken, beef, pork and turkey) to increase roughly 3-4% year over year. The company expects to realize synergies of over $200 million by fiscal 2020 from the recent buyout of AdvancePierre (acquisition completed on Jun 7).How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?Following the release, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates. There have been two revisions lower for the current quarter. In the past month, the consensus estimate has shifted down by 7.3% due to these changes.Tyson Foods, Inc. Price and Consensus  Tyson Foods, Inc. Price and Consensus | Tyson Foods, Inc. QuoteVGM ScoresAt this time, the stock has a nice Growth Score of B, though it is lagging a lot on the momentum front with an F. However, the stock was allocated a grade of A on the value side, putting it in the top 20% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of B. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Our style scores indicate that the stock is more suitable for value investors than growth investors.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock. The magnitude of this revision also indicates a downward shift. Interestingly, the stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We are expecting an inline return from the stock in the next few months.

692,TSN,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Tyson Foods, Inc. (TSN  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Tyson Foods has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 12.85, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 compares in at about 19.87. If we focus on the stock’s long-term PE trend, the current level puts Tyson Foods’s current PE ratio somewhat below its midpoint (which is 13.59) over the past five years.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 14.80. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that Tyson Foods has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 12.29, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for Tyson Foods’ stock in the near term too.  P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Tyson Foods has a P/S ratio of about 0.62. This is significantly lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.12 right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is slightly below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.If anything, this suggests some level of undervalued trading—at least compared to historical norms.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Tyson Foods currently has a Value Style Score of A, putting it into the top 20% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes TSN a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, the P/CF ratio (another great indicator of value) comes in at 10.14, which is slightly better than the industry average of 10.65. Clearly, TSN is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.What About the Stock Overall?Though Tyson Foods might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of B and a Momentum score of A. This gives TSN a VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of A. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been disappointing. The current quarter has seen two estimates go lower in the past thirty days, compared to none higher, while the full year estimate has seen a similar trend in the same time period.This has had a noticeable impact on the consensus estimate, as the current quarter consensus estimate has fallen about 6.9% in the past one month, while the full year estimate has declined about 1.9%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Tyson Foods, Inc. Price and Consensus  Tyson Foods, Inc. Price and Consensus | Tyson Foods, Inc. QuoteThis bearish trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and why we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineTyson Foods is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Moreover, a formidable industry rank (top 2% out of more than 250 industries) further supports the growth potential of the stock. However, with a Zacks Rank #3, it is hard to get too excited about this company overall. In fact, over the past one year, the sector has clearly underperformed the broader market, as you can see below:So, value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn favorable in this name first, but once that happen, this stock could be a compelling pick.4 Surprising Tech Stocks to Keep an Eye On Tech stocks have been a major force behind the market’s record highs, but picking the best ones to buy can be tough. There’s a simple way to invest in the success of the entire sector. Zacks has just released a Special Report revealing one thing tech companies literally cannot function without. More importantly, it reveals 4 top stocks set to skyrocket on increasing demand for these devices.

693,TSN,"Pinnacle Foods Inc. (PF  -  Free Report) is set to report second-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Jul 27. The question lingering in investors’ minds is, whether this branded food manufacturer will be able to maintain its positive earnings surprise streak in the to-be-reported quarter. We note that the company has outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three out of the trailing four quarters, with an average of 3.9%.Pinnacle Foods forms part of the Consumer Staples sector. Per the latest Earnings Preview, we note that the above mentioned sector’s earnings growth looks decent. While total earnings for the sector are estimated to grow 3.1%, revenues are projected to improve 1.2%.Let’s delve deeper how things are shaping up for this announcement.Which Way are Estimates Treading?Let’s look at earnings estimate revisions in order to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company right before the earnings release. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review has declined by a cent over the last 30 days and is currently pegged at 52 cents. However, it is up 23.5% from 42 cents delivered in the year-ago quarter. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $765.9 million, up 1.3% from the prior-year period. The stock also carries a VGM Score of ‘‘C’’, which makes it unfavorable for investors.Pinnacle Foods, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Pinnacle Foods, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Pinnacle Foods, Inc. QuoteWhat the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Pinnacle Foods is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP for this to happen. You may uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Pinnacle Foods has an Earnings ESP of -1.92%, as the Most Accurate Estimate of 51 cents is below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 52 cents. A negative ESP makes it unlikely to beat earnings estimates. Further, it carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). It is to be noted that we caution against Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Factors Influencing the Quarter Shares of Pinnacle Foods have moved up 3.8% in the last three months against the industry’s decline of 4.7%. The company’s strong portfolio, robust acquisitions and productivity efficiency remain the strengths of the company. However, the stock has been pressurized lately, majorly due to shunned merger speculations with Conagra Brands, Inc. (CAG  -  Free Report). If market sources were to be believed, talks of possible acquisition of Pinnacle Foods by Conagra Brands, which began on May 31, were shunned within a few days due to price disagreement between both parties.We also observed that sluggish Specialty segment and Pickle business along with increased expenses have also impacted the company’s performance negatively.The company has witnessed sluggish net sales and adjusted EBIT for the Specialty segment over the last three quarters, despite solid growth in the Snacks business. Due to a highly competitive and bidding environment for the already low-margin USDA stew business, the company continues to expect Specialty to remain challenged through 2017.Pinnacle Foods is facing sluggishness in its Pickle business due to continued category weakness and a heightened competitive environment over the last few months. Competition has increased in the form of pricing and innovation, which has put pressure on Vlasic pickles. Though innovation and in-store support for the brand is expected to be rolled out in second-quarter 2017 and is likely to strengthen trends in the second half of the year, we believe the turnaround might take some time.Regular innovations and related introductory costs have also increased the company’s expenses. Higher expenses were also caused by the enhanced overhead structure of the Boulder Brands business. Increased investment in consumer marketing and input cost inflation also adds to the expenses. We continue to anticipate inflation to adversely impact the company’s profits in the near-term.Still Interested in Consumer Staples Stocks?

694,TSN,"Philip Morris International Inc. (PM  -  Free Report) is slated to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 20, before the opening bell.The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether this tobacco leader will be able to post a positive earnings surprise in the to-be-reported quarter. Its earnings have lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average miss of 2.3%. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.What Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Our proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for Philip Morris this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP for this to happen.Philip Morris International Inc Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Philip Morris International Inc Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Philip Morris International Inc QuotePhilip Morris has an Earnings ESP of -1.63% as the Most Accurate estimate is $1.21, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged higher at $1.23. Although the company’s Zacks Rank #2 increases the predictive power of ESP, we need a positive Earnings ESP in order to be confident about an earnings surprise. You may uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Which Way Are Estimates Treading?Let’s look at the estimate revisions in order to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company right before earnings release. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.23 for the second quarter has been stable in the last seven days and reflects growth from $1.15 posted in the prior-year period. However, the same has moved up by a penny to $4.90 for 2017 and also shows growth from $4.48 delivered in 2016.Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $7.06 billion and $28.63 billion for the impending quarter and 2017, which are also 6.2% and 7.3% higher than the respective year-ago periods.Factors Influencing the QuarterWe note that Philip Morris has been witnessing declining demand for cigarettes due to the ongoing anti-tobacco campaigns, government restrictions and rising taxes on it. In fact, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has also made it mandatory for tobacco companies to use precautionary labels on cigarette packets to dissuade customers from smoking. These regulations adversely impact the company’s performance and, in turn, its overall profitability. Moreover, consumers are currently opting for e-cigarettes or substitutes for cigarettes, thereby affecting cigarette volume. Evidently, the company’s top line lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in five of the trailing six quarters, including the last reported quarter.As smoking rates are declining in developed countries, the race to replace traditional cigarettes is putting pressure on the tobacco industry. Particularly, serious health hazards due to cigarette smoking have pushed consumers toward low-risk, reduced risk products. Therefore, Philip Morris is aggressively investing in creating smoke-free products such as IQOS (Heatsticks that heat tobacco instead of burning it) in order to boost its business and market share. Meanwhile, it continues to benefit from its strong portfolio of tobacco brands and always managed to remain afloat and generate revenues with higher cigarette pricing.We expect the company’s continued focus on accelerating IQOS volume growth and pricing actions will help it deliver upbeat results in the upcoming quarter as well as in 2017.Driven by these factors, shares of Philip Morris have rallied 30.1% year to date, comfortably outperforming the Zacks categorized Tobacco industry’s advance of 18.5%. Meanwhile, the broader Consumer Staples sector gained 9.2%.Stocks Poised to Beat Earnings EstimatesHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:The Clorox Company (CLX  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.67% and a Zacks Rank #2.

695,TSN,"Shares of Blue Apron (APRN  -  Free Report) fell 9% in morning trading on Monday after news broke that Amazon.com (AMZN  -  Free Report) has registered a trademark in the U.S. for a meal-kit business.Amazon has registered for a service described as, “We do the prep. You be the chef.” The service will provide “prepared food kits… ready for cooking and assembly as a meal,” according to Amazon’s trademark application, which was filed on July 6.The food kits will contain “frozen, prepared, and packaged meals,” with “meat, poultry, fish, seafood, fruit and/or vegetables and also including sauces or seasonings, ready for cooking and assembly as a meal.”Amazon already offers meal-kits from third-party vendors, such as Tyson Foods’ (TSN  -  Free Report) Tyson Tastemakers and Sequential Brands Group Inc.’s (SQBG  -  Free Report) Martha Stewart brand, Marley Spoon. Amazon has also experimented with food delivery through AmazonFresh, a grocery delivery service offered to Prime members for a monthly fee of $14.99.This new venture by Amazon to sell their own brand of meal-kits could threaten Blue Apron’s place as the largest meal-kit provider in the U.S. The biggest complaint among meal-kit subscribers is the high price, which Amazon could potentially solve.Blue Apron stock has been consistently threatened by Amazon since its IPO last month because of Amazon’s acquisition of Whole Foods . The start-up’s issue price was $10 on June 29th, valuing the company at $1.9 billion, which was down considerably from its original estimation of $3 billion.Since its IPO, Blue Apron stock has fallen nearly 30%. Investors have worried about its ability to generate a profit. Today, the stock seems to be headed to a new all-time low.APRN remains a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), with a Value and Growth score of ‘D.’ The company is set to release its next quarterly earnings on August 10 before market open.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

697,TSN,"The S&P 500 is down roughly 6% on the year and, despite its recent gains, remains more than 12% below its April highs. Lingering doubts about the sustainability of the U.S. economic recovery, due to global headwinds and domestic weak spots, have been weighing on investors' behavior. The heightened volatility and overall market weakness appear to be reflective of a significantly weak outlook for the economy.

"
700,TSN,"Here are the three major positive factors at play in the current market:Solid Earnings: The second-quarter earnings season got off to a good start, with a solid outlook for the rest of the season. When all is said done, quarterly earnings for the S&P 500 should be up 19.9% from the year-earlier quarter. Earnings are expected to grow by 38% for the full-year 2010 and a further 17.4% in 2011. Given the recent soft economic readings on the consumer as well as manufacturing ends of the economy, there may some downside risks to these earnings-growth expectations. But we have yet to see the type of guidance and pre-announcements from management teams that would indicate a serious erosion in profitability, as would be the case at the outset of a major downturn. Very low Interest Rates: With the Fed expected to keep interest rates at the current near-zero level for an 'extended period', the monetary backdrop is about as supportive as it has been in a long while. With the 10-year Treasury bond at under-3%, even long-term interest rates are at low levels by historical standards. Given European overhang, we don't expect the Fed to start the tightening cycle until quite late in 2011.  Economic Growth Moderating, but Still Positive: Growth momentum in the U.S. economy appears to have lost some steam lately, according to recent reports. But interpreting these to mean the onset of a major downturn would be a stretch, in my view. These soft reports pertain to consumer confidence, housing and readings on the manufacturing side of the economy. The ugly recent housing data primarily reflects the expiration of tax credits, so there is hardly anything surprising there. The recent weakness in consumer confidence is primarily a reflection of the weak labor and financial markets. The recent ISM readings (both manufacturing as well as the service-sector), while below prior monthly levels, still remain at levels indicating economic expansion. Negative Forces

701,TSN,"But not everything is bright and sunny for the market; there are some clouds on the horizon. Here are the three major negative factors at play in the current market: Earnings Growth Expectations Fully Discounted: While earnings growth expectations are not unfounded, it is hard to argue that they are not already reflected in current prices. In fact, the market's upturn last week may largely be in anticipation of these earnings gains. But as we have seen with the market's reaction to a number of otherwise solid reports, I doubt if inline performance would be reassuring enough. The market is looking for unequivocal guidance and visibility that is above the current view. As such, don't be surprised if the market is unimpressed with otherwise good-looking earnings reports. Labor Market Issues: The labor market used to retrace most, if not all, of its losses by this stage in the recovery. But its performance thus far has been sub-par, particularly when viewed against the extent of job losses suffered since December 2007. While gains have no doubt been made and the overall trend remains favorable, the tepid pace of recovery to date has been casting doubt over the sustainability of the recovery. Global Headwinds: Concerns about Europe in the wake of its fiscal problems and China's growth prospects represent another layer of uncertainty that clouds the U.S. economic outlook. Europe's well-publicized problems remain a risk factor, but, short of a global liquidity crisis in the case of a major sovereign default, it is unlikely to drag down the U.S. economy. The upcoming 'stress tests' for the European banks should also help in calming things down. China remains an issue, but a growth rate in the 8% to 9% range, instead of the recent 11% to 12%, can hardly be called the end of the Chinese growth story.

702,TSN,"While I see the two forces being roughly in balance over the long run, I see more upside potential in the market over the next few weeks. With earnings season expected to reassure the markets about continued corporate profitability, the economic narrative will settle down into a stable mode over the coming days. A moderate growth profile for the U.S. economy in a backdrop of low interest rates and a stabilizing international scene should be helpful to the equity markets. Portfolio Update
"
703,TSN,"We made three changes to the Focus List portfolio last week; adding two stocks and deleting one. We didn't make any changes to the Growth & Income portfolio. There were also changes to the Timely Buys list.   
"
704,TSN,"We added SanDisk Corp. (SNDK) to gain a quality large-cap tech exposure. This flash-memory specialist offers solid earnings momentum at present, with estimates for both this year and next going up. Despite its solid growth credentials, the company remains a compelling value right now. Tyson Foods (TSN  -  Free Report), the $6.5 billion market-cap global food player, has a Zacks #2 Rank ('buy'), with a solid earnings profile. This dividend-paying company (yielding around 0.9%) is a stability play in the portfolio.  
"
705,TSN,"We exited our CPFL Energia  position to stay consistent with our investment framework that calls for getting out of Zacks #4 ('sell') Rank and Zacks #5 ('strong sell') Rank stocks. This Brazilian utility recently fell to a Zacks #5 Rank, prompting our deletion, though we continue to like this high-yielding (currently around 6.7%) stock.
