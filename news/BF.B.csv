6,BF.B,"Tyson Foods, Inc. (TSN  -  Free Report) took yet another step to expand its portfolio of meat products and address the rising protein demand. The leading chicken, meat and prepared foods producer’s venture capital arm – Tyson Ventures made an investment in Memphis Meats, with the deal terms remaining under covers.Memphis Meats concentrates on developing ways to produce cultural meat directly from animals’ cells without killing them — a method that is not only safer for animals but is also better for the environment and consumers. This food-tech startup intends to use the funds from Tyson Foods to speed up product development. While Tyson Foods now holds a minority stake in Memphis Foods, the latter has attracted many other investors in the past including Cargill, Bill Gates, DFJ, Atomico and Richard Branson.Tyson Foods’ latest move underscores its constant efforts to expand its protein-rich offerings, as the demand for such products has been growing and is expected to rise further in the times ahead. Alongside the widening demography of protein-savvy consumers, traditional meat sales face intense pressure due to increasing environmental concerns about intensive animal farming and animal welfare. Given these factors, we believe that the aforementioned investment deems fit.Focus on Protein-Packed Products: A Major DriverWell, Tyson Foods has long been making efforts to expand protein-packed brands. In this regard, the company’s AdvancePierre buyout favorably impacted the Prepared Foods segment’s performance in the last two quarters. To further enrich the Prepared Foods category, the company announced the buyout of Original Philly Holdings in November 2017. Management continues to expect positive synergies from the acquisitions.Additionally, the company made investments of $84 million (in August 2017) and $300 million (in November 2017) to expand poultry production capacity in Tennessee.  Other than this, the company has also undertaken divesture of non-protein businesses (such as Sara Lee Frozen Bakery, Kettle and Van’s) to focus more on the growing protein-packed food arena.All said, Tyson Foods seems to be well equipped with the categories that are currently in high demand at the national foodservice chains. Further, the company is set to make significant investments to improve the supply network within the food-service channel.Notably, Tyson Foods’ top- and bottom-line results have been gaining from such efforts, which have also boosted investors’ confidence in the stock. Markedly, the company’s shares have rallied nearly 28% in a year, surpassing the industry’s upside of 20.5%. We believe that efforts like the aforementioned investment in Memphis Meats, is likely to spur further growth for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company.  Looking for More Promising Stocks?

Meanwhile, the company has entered the fastest-growing spirit category — the Irish Whiskey — with the purchase of all Slane Castle Irish Whiskey Limited’s shares in Ireland. The company expects to gain from new product launches including Jack Daniel's Tennessee Rye and Slane Irish Whiskey as well. In another development, the company acquired two historic properties at West Main Street in Louisville, KY to boost its Old Forester brand.Shareholders to Benefit – Stock Split & Special DividendBrown-Forman has a tradition of returning cash to shareholders through regular dividend payouts and share repurchases. Evidently, it has been consistently paying quarterly cash dividends for the last 72 years in addition to raising dividend for 34 consecutive years.Reaffirming this commitment, Brown-Forman approved various capital deployment actions that will benefit shareholders, employees and community. As part of these actions, the company proposed a five for four stock-split for its Class A and Class B common stocks and a special dividend, besides bringing additional funds for its defined benefit program and creating a charitable foundation.Clearly, these initiatives reflect the strength of the company’s balance sheet and healthy business. Also, these positives are bolstered by the expected benefits from the tax reform.Do Beverages-Alcohol Stocks Grab Your Attention? Check TheseInvestors interested may consider Boston Beer Company Inc.

8,BF.B,"Molson Coors Brewing Company (TAP  -  Free Report) reported fourth-quarter 2017 results, wherein both the top and bottom line improved year over year and the latter also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Further, the company exceeded its cost-savings target for the year, encouraging management to raise its three-year target for 2019.The solid results helped this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock gain 2.7% in the pre-market trading hours. Let’s see if this can bring a turn around to the stock’s otherwise drab performance. Well, Molson Coors’ shares have plunged 22.5% in a year, as against the industry’s growth of 14%. Molson Coors’ adjusted earnings of 62 cents per share surged 31.9% year over year and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 56 cents. The upside is attributable to favorable global pricing, net pension benefits, MG&A efficiencies and indirect tax provision cycling. However, this was partly countered by reduced volumes, inflation, greater underlying tax rate and investments in global business capacities. Molson Coors Brewing Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Molson Coors Brewing Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Molson Coors Brewing Company Quote Delving DeeperNet sales (excluding excise taxes) advanced 4.5% to $2,579.6 million but was below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,597 million. The sales growth was backed by better global pricing, royalty volume, cycling of indirect tax provision and currency translations, somewhat negated by soft financial volumes. On a constant currency basis, net sales climbed 2.4%. While sales declined in the United States, it witnessed improvements in all other regions. Notably net sales per hectoliter improved 5.8% (up 3.7% on a constant-currency basis), on the back of the same factors that drove net sales.Molson Coors’ worldwide brand volume inched lower by 1.1% to 22.4 million hectoliters owing to soft U.S. and International volumes, partly compensated by strength in European and Canadian regions. Global priority volumes dipped 1.9%, while financial volumes slipped 1.2% to 23.1 million hectoliters. Financial volumes were hurt by softness in United States.Underlying EBITDA was $480.3 million in the quarter, marking a 17% jump from the year-ago period. Further, underlying EBITDA ascended 14.3% on a constant currency basis.Segment DetailsThe company operates through the following geographical segments.Canada: Molson Coors Canada net sales rose 7.1% to $352.9 million in the quarter. Net sales per hectoliter grew 1% in local currency, driven by better pricing, partly countered by unfavorable sales mix. Further, Canada brand volume climbed 0.8%, thanks to increased sales of craft and import brands. Financial volumes (which includes contract brewing volumes) inched up 1%. Underlying EBITDA fell 4.2% to $79 million due to higher COGS, partly made up by better pricing; favorable currency and reduced MG&A costs.United States (MillerCoors): Molson Coors now has complete ownership rights to all the brands in the MillerCoors portfolio for the U.S. market. Segment net sales (on pro-forma basis) decreased 0.6% to $1,724.7 million. Domestic net revenue per hectoliter, which excludes contract brewing and company-owned-distributor sales, improved 1.4%. This stemmed from favorable pricing, partly countered by negative mix. However, U.S. domestic sales-to-retailers volume (STRs) and domestic sales-to-wholesalers volume (STWs) declined 3% and 1.5%, respectively. The former was accountable to soft Premium Light volumes. The segment’s underlying EBITDA grew 4.9% to $346 million thanks to higher net pricing, lower M&A costs and cost savings. This was partly offset by reduced STW volumes and COGS inflation.Europe: The segment reported net sales growth of 29% to $473.2 million in the quarter. Europe net sales per hectoliter jumped 16.3% in local currency driven by positive mix, inclusion of export brand and royalty revenues and cycling of indirect tax provision. Additionally, Europe brand volume improved 10.4% in the quarter, whereas financial volume (including contract brewing and factored brands, excluding royalty volume) went up by 2.7%. Brand volumes were aided by strength in above-premium brands, transfer of royalty and export brand volumes into this segment from the International segment. Underlying EBITDA surged considerably year over year, from $28.1 million to $102.7 million.International: Segment net sales surged 19% $71.4 million. Net sales per hectoliter grew 6.1%, courtesy of changes in sales mix and better pricing. However, International brand volume plunged 15.1% in the quarter, marred by transfer of export and royalty volumes to European segment and Modelo contract loss in Japan. This was partly cushioned by inclusion of Puerto Rico’s business from MillerCoors and growth in various markets of Latin America. Segment underlying EBITDA came in at $0.4 million in the quarter, much lower than $1.4 million the year-ago period. This was accountable to increased MG&A costs associated with Miller International’s addition, loss of the Modelo deal and transfer of export and royalty volumes to Europe.Other Financial UpdatesThe company’s net cash from operating activities in 2017 came in at $1.866 billion, while underlying free cash flow was $1.449 billion. Underlying free cash flow jumped 67.8% year over year.The company ended 2017 with cash and cash equivalents of $418.6 million and net debt of $10.895 billion. Notably, the company’s net debt declined substantially from the beginning of 2017. The company also made contributions to its defined-benefit pension plans during the year thus moving ahead with its deleveraging targets.Notably, the company generated cost savings of more than $255 million in 2017, that surpassed its target by more than $80 million. Encouraged by this, the company raised its three-year savings goal to $600 million, which is expected to be generated by 2019.OutlookManagement remains impressed with its 2017 results, which was marked by enhanced top line, global brand volume growth and higher net sales per hectoliter, even amid tough market conditions. Notably, the company’s focus on portfolio premiumization and revenue management have been paying off. Also, the company enhanced its financial position by paying down debt and increased market share in Canada and Europe, while it also exceeded its cost-savings and free cash flow target. Moreover, Molson Coors optimized commercial expenditure, which helped it deliver solid net income and underlying EBITDA growth in 2017.Further, the company remains committed toward First Choice, and remains focused on strengthening its brand portfolio. Given these factors, along with focus on achieving cost savings and solidifying balance sheet, we remain optimistic about Molson Coors ongoing prospects.For 2018, Molson Coors anticipates generating cost savings of roughly $210 million. Further, it expects to deliver underlying free cash flow of around $1.5 billion in 2018, (plus or minus 10%). Capital spending is expected to be roughly $670 million (plus or minus 10%). Underlying tax rate for the year is likely to range from 18-22%, thanks to the latest tax reforms.Molson Coors expects 2018 to also be impacted by new revenue recognition standard (which became effective in 2018 beginning) and the updated pension guidance.Don’t Miss These Consumer Staples StocksBoston Beer (SAM  -  Free Report) with a solid earnings surprise history, sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

Pre-exceptional earnings per share for the first half of fiscal 2018 grew 9.4% (in local currency) year over year. The upside was backed by increased organic operating profit and reduced finance costs.  While Diageo’s stock didn’t react much to the announcement, shares of this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company have rallied 33.2% in a year, faring even better than the industry’s 26.1% surge.

Also, all regions witnessed organic sales growth, driven by Diageo’s strong brand portfolio and solid reach.

Organic margins rose 81 basis points.Segment DetailsOrganic sales grew 2% in North America due to higher sales at U.S. Spirits which in turn was fueled by strength across all categories other than Vodka.  Categorically, results were led by Don Julio in the Tequila category; North American whiskey; Captain Morgan in the Rum category and Baileys. Operating profit (organic) rose 3%.In Europe, Russia and Turkey, organic sales increased 4% on greater volumes. Also, improved pricing in Turkey aided price mix, while it was partly offset by unfavorable mix from Gordon’s and Baileys in Europe. Organic operating profit in the region improved 12%.Organic sales in Africa climbed 2%, driven by strong performance in Nigeria, which was partly hampered by softness in Africa Regional Markets and South Africa.     Also, price/mix remained negative due to heightened competition in South Africa, accelerated growth in Mainstream Spirits across East Africa and Nigeria. This was somewhat compensated by favorable pricing in Nigeria. In Africa, operating profit (organic) fell 3%Organic sales in the Latin America and Caribbean region ascended 7% backed by strong growth in Mexico and PUB.

11,BF.B,"Markets closed mostly lower after a decline in tech stocks following a dip in the shares of Apple. Also weighing on broader markets were Wilbur Ross’ and Steve Mnuchin’s comments at Davos. However, the Dow managed to post a record close after assistance from financial stocks. Meanwhile, the existing home sales for December came in below expected.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) increased less than 0.2%, to close at 26,252.12. The S&P 500 fell almost 0.1% to close at 2,837.54. The tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index closed at 7,415.06, losing 0.6%. The fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) increased 3.3% to close at 11.47. A total of around 7.63 billion shares were traded on Wednesday, higher than the last 20-session average of 6.53 billion shares. Decliners outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by a 1.21-to-1 ratio. On Nasdaq, a 1.68-to-1 ratio favored declining issues.Dow Manages Gains on a Tough DayEarlier in the session, a surge in industrial stocks boosted the Dow. Shares of industrial behemoths like General Electric (GE  -  Free Report), Boeing (BA  -  Free Report) and Caterpillar (CAT  -  Free Report) all shot up. Caterpillar, in particular, gained after it witnessed an increase in its monthly machine retail sales. However, shares of Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) declined by as much as 1.6% and weighed heavily on the blue-chip index. Also, comments from U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin weighed on the Dow.Wilbur Ross commented on Wednesday that United States was prepared for a trade war with China if the need arises. Speaking at the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Switzerland, Ross stated: “So trade wars have been in place for quite a little while; the difference is the US troops are now coming to the ramparts.” Ross also blamed China for hiding its practice of trade protectionism under the veil of free trade.Even more noteworthy comments were heard from his colleague U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin who said the Trump administration favored “bilateral trade agreements.”’ Mnuchin added that any weakness in the dollar was beneficial for trade. His comments led to the ICE U.S. Dollar Index falling below the 90 mark for the first time since Dec 2014.Further, the Trump administration imposed high tariffs on imported washing machines and solar panels on Monday. Such protectionist policies weighed on the greenback and broader markets.Finally, the Dow managed to gain 41.3 points and finished at a fresh record. Gains for the blue-chip index were supported by a surge in financial stocks. Shares of Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report) and American Express (AXP  -  Free Report) surged 2.2% and 1.4%, respectively and led the Dow higher, offsetting the losses incurred earlier.

Following such comments, shares of the tech behemoth plunged. Also weighing on the broader index was a decline in shares of Facebook, Amazon and Alphabet, which lost 1.5%, 0.4% and 0.4%, respectively.Meanwhile, S&P 500 lost 1.6 points to end in negative territory, followed by a dip in tech stocks. Of the 11 major segments of the S&P 500, six ended in the red, with tech and utilities leading the laggards. The Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLK) and Utilities Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLU) declined 0.8% and 0.6%, respectively. Such broad based losses for the tech stocks also weighed on the tech-laden index, Nasdaq, which shed 45.2 points to close in the red.Economic DataOn the economic data front, the U.S. flash services PMI, released by IHS Markit declined to 53.3 this month. On the other hand, the flash manufacturing PMI surged to 55.5 in the same period.Meanwhile, existing home sales for the month of December 2017 increased to 5.57 million units, below the consensus estimate of an increase of 5.69 million units. The reported value for the previous month was 5.78 million units. Such a dismal performance was due to a decline of 11.4% in the inventory for the month of December.Stocks That Made HeadlinesXilinx Q3 Earnings & Revenues Top Estimates, Stock UpShares of Xilinx Inc.

13,BF.B,"Constellation Brands Inc. (STZ  -  Free Report) has been gaining from its spectacular earnings surprise history driven by constant brand-building efforts, acquisitions and strength in its beer business. The cumulative effect of these traits is visible in the company’s bull run in the past year.Shares of Constellation Brands surged 44% in a year, outperforming the industry’s growth of 21.7%. Let’s analyze the factors boosting this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock’s performance.Robust Earnings Trend, Outlook RaisedConstellation Brands boasts an impressive earnings surprise history of 13 straight quarters and solid bottom-line growth for 18 consecutive quarters. The company’s third-quarter fiscal 2018 results gained from constant efforts to drive consumer demand for its robust brand portfolio. Contributions from acquisitions along with continued strength particularly in the beer business aided results as well.Meanwhile, management remains encouraged by Constellation Brands’ outstanding results along with the strength in the beer business that led to improved earnings outlook for fiscal 2018. While, the company raised fiscal 2018 operating income target for the beer segment, it retained the sales forecast for the same time period.Currently, it envisions adjusted earnings guidance in a range of $8.40-$8.50 per share. Operating income for the beer segment is also anticipated to grow 18-19%.Strategic Initiatives Boost RevenuesConstellation Brands’ constant brand building efforts and initiatives to add new products to its robust portfolio are the key revenue drivers. Owing to its strategic endeavors, the company is witnessing increasing market share, especially in the U.S. beer category. Notably, the company was the highest growth contributor in the U.S. beer category and generated 80% of the total U.S. beer category growth.In addition, the company is focused on expanding in the craft beer space, which has become a solid growth avenue in the beer space. In this regard, management expects solid results from its Ballast Point craft beer brand, which is currently placed among the top 20 craft brands nationwide.Constellation Brands remains focused on expanding its business operations in order to achieve growth. Its recent acquisitions in the beer segment include Funky Buddha Brewery, a leading craft brewery in Florida, Fathom IPA by Ballast Point Brewery and the Obregon Brewery.Moreover, the company is on track with the glass plant expansion, which is expected to cater to more than 50% of the glass demand.Some acquisitions enhancing its wine business portfolio include Schrader Cellars, High West Distillery, Charles Smith Wines and The Prisoner Wine Company brands. Constellation Brands sees immense potential for growth in its wine and spirits business, which in turn might benefit the company’s performance.Beer Business Strength – A Key Growth DriveConstellation Brands’ beer business has been performing significantly well over the years.

15,BF.B,"Archer Daniels Midland Company (ADM  -  Free Report) has been in soup due to the tough operating environment in the Agricultural industry stemming from fluctuating commodity prices and oversupply in the industry. This has been largely weighing upon the company’s top and bottom lines, keeping margins strained. The cumulative effect of this is visible in the company’s stock movement in recent months.Notably, Archer Daniels stock declined 7.3% in the last three months, underperforming the industry’s 5.6% downside. Moreover, the stock has witnessed a fall of 5.4% since reporting dismal third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 31, 2017. This resulted in the company fall to Rank #5 (Strong Sell) on Zacks list. That said, let’s peek into the factors behind Archer Daniels’ doom.Industry Trends Lead to a Drab Surprise HistoryThe aforementioned industry concerns have been persistently hurting Archer Daniels’ quarterly performance over the past few years. This has been significantly weighing upon the company’s top-line in all segments, leading to a dismal sales surprise for more than three years now. Moreover, the company has posted negative earnings surprise in three of the trailing four quarters. Consequently, it has recorded an average negative earnings surprise of 4.1% in the trailing four quarters.Archer-Daniels-Midland Company Price and EPS Surprise Archer-Daniels-Midland Company Price and EPS Surprise | Archer-Daniels-Midland Company QuoteIn the most recent third-quarter 2017, earnings were hurt by a tough operating environment at the company’s Agricultural services and Oilseeds Processing segments, while sales declined across all segments. Based on the dismal third-quarter performance and negative surprise trend, we remain apprehensive about the company’s future performance.Segmental Hazards Hurt MarginsAdditionally, the company’s margins remain under pressure due to soft operating performance at the Agricultural Services and Oilseeds Processing segments. Adjusted operating margin declined 16.8% in the third quarter. Margins at Agricultural Services segment were hurt by soft merchandising and handling results for North America Grain due to lack of competitiveness of U.S. corn and soybeans in global markets. Further, lower crushing margins as well as lower South American origination margins resulted in reduced margins at Oilseeds Processing segment.Is There Hope for Improvement?While the company’s operating performance trend is not very encouraging, it remains committed to strengthen capacities and geographic spread, through buyouts and other organic expansions. These factors and the prospects from Project Readiness, position it to deliver solid bottom-line growth in 2017.Further, Archer Daniels is transitioning from a period of costs and investments in acquisitions, new innovation centers and facilities, to focusing on reducing capital spending and increasing benefits from investments, in the fourth quarter. It also remains on track to exceed cost savings target of nearly $225 million for 2017. These initiatives provide a ray of hope in the otherwise tarnished performance graph of the company.Not Done with Consumer Staples Stocks Yet?

However, underlying gross profit improved 8%.Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses remained flat from the year-ago quarter at $163 million, while on an underlying basis it declined 1%. This was primarily backed by stringent cost controls.However, advertising expenses rose 4% year over year to $111 million, while underlying advertising costs increased 3%.

Earlier, the company had forecasted underlying sales growth of 4-5%.Nevertheless, the company expects the positive operating leverage experienced in the first-half to reverse in the second half. The reversal will stem from higher cost of sales and increased operating investments in the second half mainly related to the favorable environment for the company’s brands.Consequently, the company expects a moderate increase in SG&A expense on an underlying basis. Further, underlying A&P growth is anticipated to be nearly in line with sales growth.Despite incorporating higher costs, underlying operating income is anticipated to increase 8-9% in fiscal 2018, compared with 6-8% growth expected earlier.

20,BF.B,"Global brewer Molson Coors Brewing Company (TAP  -  Free Report) reported third-quarter 2017 results, wherein both top and bottom lines fell year over year and the former also lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, earnings came in line with the consensus mark, faring better than its three-quarter long trend of posting negative surprise.Molson Coors Brewing Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Molson Coors Brewing Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Molson Coors Brewing Company QuoteWhile the stock hasn’t moved much in the pre-market trading hours, Molson Coors’ shares have plunged 15.9% so far this year, as against the industry’s growth of 25.1%.Molson Coors’ adjusted earnings of $1.34 per share came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate, though it dropped 3.6% from the prior-year figure of $1.39. The decline stemmed from lower financial volumes, increased amortization costs, elevated general and administrative and greater tax rate. This was partly compensated by improved net pricing and mix, reduced interest expense and cost savings.Delving DeeperNet sales (on pro-forma basis) dipped 2.1% to $2,883.2 million, which came below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3,000 million. The sales decline was accountable to lower financial volumes, partly offset by better global pricing; favorable mix; royalty volume and currency translations. On a constant currency basis, sales dropped 3%. While sales declined in United States, it witnessed improvements in all other regions. Notably net sales per hectoliter improved 2.9%, backed by better pricing and mix.Molson Coors’ worldwide brand volume inched up 0.6% to 25.5 million hectoliters in the quarter driven by robust growth in European and International regions. This in turn was backed by the addition of Miller global brands business as well as improvements in some of the company’s key brands. Financial volumes dipped 4.8% to 26.3 million hectoliters, whereas global priority brand volumes jumped 2.4%. Financial volumes were impacted by curtailments in wholesale inventories, brand volumes and contract brewing — which largely weighed upon U.S. and Canadian volumes.Underlying EBITDA was $679.7 million in the quarter, a slip of 0.4% from the year-ago period. Further, underlying EBITDA on a constant-currency basis went down by 1.2.Segment DetailsThe company operates through the following geographical segments.Canada: Molson Coors Canada net sales climbed 1% to $406.4 million in the quarter. Net sales per hectoliter grew 2% in local currency, driven by better pricing and brand mix. However, Canada brand volume declined 1.7% owing to soft domestic volumes, partly compensated by impacts of Miller brands. Financial volumes (which includes contract brewing volumes) fell 4.7% on account of lower wholesale inventories and soft contract brewing volume. The segment’s underlying EBITDA dipped 0.5% to $112.1 million.United States (MillerCoors): Molson Coors now has complete ownership rights to all the brands in the MillerCoors portfolio for the U.S. market. Segment net sales (on pro-forma basis) decreased 5.5% to $1,892 million in the quarter. Domestic net revenue per hectoliter, which excludes contract brewing and company-owned-distributor sales, improved 1.2%. This stemmed from favorable pricing, partly countered by negative mix. However, both U.S. domestic sales-to-retailers volume (STRs) and domestic sales-to-wholesalers volume (STWs) declined 2.9% and 7.2%, respectively. The former was accountable to soft volumes in Premium Light and Below Premium units. The segment’s underlying EBITDA grew 0.8% to $475.6 million thanks to higher net pricing, lower M&A costs and cost savings. This was partly offset by lower shipment volumes.Europe: The segment reported net sales growth of 9.5% to $561.2 million in the third quarter of 2017. Europe net sales per hectoliter grew 4.1% in local currency driven by positive mix and net pricing. While Europe brand volume increased 9.6% in the quarter, financial volume (including contract brewing and factored brands, excluding royalty volume) went up by 2.7%. Volumes were aided by contributions from Miller brands and strength in the company’s main and above-premium brands. Europe underlying EBITDA surged 13.6% to $140.3 million, backed by greater volume, favorable pricing and mix, higher net pension benefit and positive impacts from currency translations.International: Segment net sales almost doubled to $65.7 million in the quarter. Net sales per hectoliter fell 11.6%, owing to unfavorable sales mix, somewhat cushioned by improved pricing. Total International brand volume soared 64.7% in the quarter, on the back of Puerto Rico’s business transfer from MillerCoors, the inclusion of the Miller global brands, and growth of Coors Light, mainly in Latin America. International underlying EBITDA suffered a loss of $1 million in the quarter, narrower than the loss of $1.8 million a year ago. The improvement came on the back of higher volume and better pricing, though it was partly countered by increased M&A costs along with loss of the Japanese Modelo deal.Other Financial UpdatesThe company ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $971.3 million and total debt of $12,319 million.Net cash from operating activities in the first three quarters of 2017 was $1,145.4 million, while underlying free cash flow was $836.4 million.OutlookManagement remains impressed with its year-to-date results, which is marked by global brand volume growth and higher net sales per hectoliter. Notably, the company’s focus on portfolio premiumization has helped it achieve better pricing and mix. Also, in the year so far, Molson Coors’ above-premium brands have jumped more than 20%, thus representing about 20% of the company’s global volume. Moreover, the company is witnessing enhanced EBITDA margins, thanks to its cost-saving efforts.Even amid tough North American conditions, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company remains on track to achieve its financial goals for 2017, alongside exceeding its cost savings and cash flow targets for the year.

21,BF.B,"The Boston Beer Company, Inc. (SAM  -  Free Report) reported better-than-expected third-quarter 2017 results, wherein the top and bottom lines surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Also, the bottom line improved year over year.Notably, the quarter marked the company’s fourth consecutive positive earnings surprise and second straight sales beat.Q3 HighlightsBoston Beer’s third-quarter earnings per share of $2.78 topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.84 and improved 12.1% year over year. This outperformance stemmed from higher gross margin coupled with lower general and administrative costs and tax rate, somewhat compensated with decline in revenues due to lower volumes.During the quarter, the company recorded a tax benefit of 4 cents owing to the adoption of the new Accounting Standard – Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting (ASU 2016-09), effective Jan 1, 2017.Net revenue dropped nearly 3% year over year to $247 million. Excluding excise taxes, top line dipped 2.6% year over year to $264.1 million but outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $259 million. Further, shipment volume declined 4% to 1.1 million barrels and depletions were down 3.5%.In the reported quarter, depletion volumes were mainly hurt by persistent decline in the Samuel Adams and Angry Orchard brands, as well as marginal adversity from the timing of the quarter, particularly related to the fourth of July holiday. This was partly mitigated by growth in Twisted Tea, and Truly Spiked & Sparkling brands.Though management pointed to some improvement in the overall depletion trends from the beginning of the year, it stated that the on-premise channel remains tough. Further, trends in the craft beer and cider categories continued to remain soft. Also, challenges related to a competitive retail backdrop persist, providing lot of drinking options.Meanwhile, Boston Beer continues to project soft depletion trends for 2017. Evidently, depletions for the year-to-date period through the 42 weeks ended Oct 21, 2017 are estimated to have declined nearly 6% from the comparable year-ago period.Costs & MarginsGross profit slipped 1.6% year over year to $131.5 million, while gross margin expanded 50 basis points to 53.2% in the quarter. The improvement in gross margin can be attributed to higher revenue per barrel that resulted from better pricing and package mix, along with lower brewery processing costs due to waste reductions and efficiency gains. These were partly mitigated by adverse fixed cost absorption owing to lower volumes.Nevertheless, advertising, promotional and selling expenses remained flat at $63.6 million, owing to marginally greater media spending, which was offset by lower freight to distributors. This, in turn, resulted in lower volume and rates.General and administrative expenses slumped 15.9% to $16.4 million, mainly due to declines in stock compensation associated with it’s retirement of its chief executive officer in 2018, along with salary and benefit costs, consulting and legal expenses.FinancialsAs of Sep 30, 2017, Boston Beer had cash and cash equivalents of $70 million and total stockholders’ equity of $414.3 million.During the nine months of 2017, the company generated approximately $108.2 million of cash from operating activities.As of Oct 20, 2017, Boston Beer bought back about 884,000 shares worth roughly $130.5 million. With this, it had nearly $192.8 million remaining on the $931.0 million share buyback authorization.Growth PlanManagement remains committed to a three-point growth plan. Firstly, revival of the Samuel Adams and Angry Orchard brands through packaging, innovation, promotion and brand communication initiatives. Moving forward, the company plans to launch new media campaigns for these brands. These innovations include Samuel Adams Sam '76, Samuel Adams New England IPA and Angry Orchard Rose, which are likely to be launched nationally in the first quarter of 2018. Additionally, it targets maintaining momentum for the Twisted Tea brand.Secondly, accelerated focus on cost savings and efficiency projects with savings directed for further brand development. In this regard, the company has adjusted the organization to the new volume environment while at the same time retained its capability to innovate and return to growth. Evidently, the results of these initiatives reflected in gross margin improvements and lower operating expenses in the third quarter. On the back of this early success, Boston Beer reiterated the previously revealed target of improving gross margin by one percentage point every year through 2019.Lastly, long-term innovation coupled with current focus in maintaining the leadership of Truly Spiked & Sparkling brand and ensuring it reaches full potential.Furthermore, Boston Beer remains focused on making investments to revive hard cider category and Angry Orchard brand. Going forward, the company remains optimistic on the future of craft beer and cider category growth.Markedly, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s shares have gained 22% in the past six months compared with the industry’s growth of 10.9%. We believe these initiatives to drive growth and retain the stock momentum, going forward.GuidanceManagement updated its outlook for 2017. Depending upon the current spending and investment plans, adjusted earnings per share, excluding the impact of ASU 2016-09, are now estimated in the range of $5.60-$6.20 compared with the prior guidance of $5.00–$6.20. However, the company stated that the actual results may deviate significantly from current projections. Moreover, the company affirmed that 2017 will include 52 weeks versus 53 weeks in 2016.Other assumptions for earnings include depletions and shipments changes of -7% to -4% compared with the previous forecast of -7% to 1%. In the meantime, Boston Beer continues to anticipate revenues per barrel to increase 1-2%. Gross margin is continued to be anticipated to range from 51-52%. Investment in advertising, promotional and selling expenses are envisioned to increase in the band of $10-$20 million compared with $20-$30 million, projected earlier.Adjusted effective tax rate guidance for 2017 is maintained to be nearly 37%, excluding the impact of ASU 2016-09. Further, capital expenditures for the year are still guided in the band of $35-$45 million, which will be directed toward investment in breweries.Also, management issued guidance for 2018. Depletions and shipments are likely to rise in low-single digits. Prices are expected to grow in 1-2% range. Gross margin expansion is guided from 52-53%, owing to the progress on the cost initiatives as well. Investment in advertising, promotional and selling expenses are envisioned to increase in the range of $15-$25 million.Further, adjusted effective tax rate guidance for 2018 is anticipated to be roughly 37%, excluding the impact of ASU 2016-09. Capital spending is expected in the band of $55-$65 million in 2018, which can move higher per the requirements.Looking for Solid Stocks, Check TheseSome better-ranked stocks in the broader Consumer Staples sector include Constellation Brands, Inc.

22,BF.B,"After posting back-to-back misses in the last two quarters, Altria Group Inc. (MO  -  Free Report) delivered a positive earnings surprise in third-quarter 2017, which also marked its third straight quarter of year-over-year bottom-line growth. However, top line fell year over year and lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Nonetheless, the company kept its 2017 earnings guidance intact.Quarter in detailAdjusted earnings of 90 cents per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 87 cents. Also, earnings increased 9.8% year over year, on the back of higher operating income in the smokeable and smokeless segments and lower outstanding shares. This was somewhat offset by reduced equity earnings from the company’s investment in beer.Altria Group Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Altria Group Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Altria Group QuoteHowever, net revenues fell 2.5% to $6,729 million in the quarter, owing to soft net revenues in the smokeable products segments. Revenues net of excise taxes slipped 1.3% year over year to $5,123 million. This also came below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5,196 million.In e-vapor, Altria’s subsidiary Nu Mark LLC continues to boost MarkTen volume and retail share. MarkTen’s third-quarter national retail market share was approximately 13.5% in mainstream retail channels. Further, it forms nearly 65% of e-vapor volumes in those channels.However, if we look into Altria’s stock performance over a year, we note that the stock has moved up just 3.9%, in comparison to the industry’s growth of 11.4%.We believe declining demand for cigarettes due to the ongoing anti-tobacco campaigns, government restrictions and higher cigarette prices in response to rising taxes have been weighing on the stock. Strict Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations on cigarette packaging dissuade customers from smoking. Additionally, consumers’ preference for e-cigarettes or substitutes for cigarettes are largely affecting the cigarette volume. Evidently, Altria’s top line lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in seven of the last nine quarters, including this quarter.Segment DetailsSmokeable Products Segment: Revenues net of excise taxes dipped 1.5% year over year to $4,410 million, due to soft volumes that was somewhat compensated by better pricing. Cigarette shipment volumes fell 6.2% year over year, stemming from lower cigarette industry volumes, unfavorable trade inventory movements and decline in retail share. On the other hand, shipment volumes for cigars rose 6.6% in the quarter. Total cigarette retail share declined to 50.5%, representing a 0.6 percentage point slip.Adjusted operating companies income (OCI) increased 7.7% to $2,300 million, while adjusted OCI margins jumped 4.5 percentage points to 52.2%.Smokeless Products: Revenues net of excise taxes advanced 4.5% to $515 million in the quarter. This was driven by better pricing and reduced promotions, partly countered by unfavorable mix and soft volumes. Shipment volumes fell 1.8% to 212.6 million units, where Copenhagen and Skoal shipment volumes dropped 2% and others increased 1.2% in the quarter. Total smokeless products retail share grew 1.1 percentage points to 53.8% in the quarter.Adjusted OCI surged 15.7% to $362 million and margins expanded 6.8 percentage points to 70.3%.Wine: The segment’s revenues, net of excise taxes, remained nearly flat year over year at $175 million. Results here were impacted by trade inventory reductions, heightened competition and sluggish growth of premium wine. Wine shipment volume was also almost flat at 2.2 million units.Adjusted OCI declined 5.3% to $36 million, mainly accountable to soft volumes and escalated expenses. OCI margin decreased 1 percentage point to 20.6%.Financial UpdatesIn August 2017, Altria announced an 8.2% hike in its quarterly cash dividend to 66 cents per share. During the third quarter, Altria paid dividends worth $1.2 billion and intends to maintain a payout ratio of 80% of its bottom line. Further, the company repurchased 11.1 million shares under its existing share repurchase program for approximately $759 million. As of Sep 30, 2017, Altria had approximately $576 million remaining under its share repurchase program of $4 billion. Altria expects to complete the program by the end of second-quarter 2018.Consolidation of Manufacturing FacilitiesIn October 2016, Altria announced the consolidation of several of its manufacturing facilities to streamline operations and achieve greater efficiencies. The consolidation, scheduled to be completed by first-quarter 2018 is expected to deliver approximately $50 million in cost.OutlookThis Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company reaffirmed earnings guidance for full-year 2017 and expects adjusted earnings in a range of $3.26-$3.32, up 7.5% to 9.5% compared with adjusted earnings of $3.03 in 2016. Altria expects 2017 full-year effective tax rate on operations to be roughly 35.5%.Don’t Miss These Consumer Staples StocksOllie's Bargain Outlet Holdings, Inc.

23,BF.B,"Diageo plc (DEO  -  Free Report), one of the prominent players in the U.S. alcohol industry, seems to be cheering on favorable market trends. Diageo, like most companies in the alcohol space, is benefiting from steadily surging demand, a stable U.S. economy and constant innovations to suit the changing tastes of consumers.Driven by such strong fundamentals, Diageo has emerged into a preferred pick for investors. Evidently, shares of this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company surged 35.5% in a year, compared with the industry’s rally of 22.8%. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Further, we expect this alcohol giant to continue on its growth path, backed by strategies to augment offerings and expand business reach.Acquisitions Aid Growth in the Spirits CategoryThe spirits segment, amongst other alcohol categories, is gaining much traction as consumers are inclining toward flavored whisky, premium tequilas and other spirits.Notably, Diageo has also been striving to augment its spirit-based alcohol portfolio through acquisitions. In June 2017, the company announced the acquisition of the fastest-growing premium tequila brand, Casamigos, in a deal worth $1 billion. This buyout is likely to strengthen Diageo's market share in the tequila category along with the existing Don Julio brand. Also, the company will capitalize on its presence in the high-growth international markets. Other noteworthy acquisitions in this segment include United Spirits Limited, De Leon Comb Wine & Spirits, Shui Jing Fang and Halico.The booming spirit segment trend has also been aiding other alcohol manufactures like Brown-Forman (BF.B  -  Free Report) and Constellation Brands (STZ  -  Free Report). Further, companies like Boston Beer Company (SAM  -  Free Report) have been taking advantage of the growing demand, by adding products to their portfolio.  Focus on Emerging Markets and High-Margin BrandsLike most multinationals, Diageo has been focusing on expanding in the emerging markets. It is the leading international spirits company in markets of Africa, Latin America and Asia. Moreover, the company has been successful in the emerging regions by catering to local tastes. Products like Johnnie Walker and Blue Label have been customized according to the local palate in China, India, Thailand, Vietnam, Brazil and Mexico.Further, Diageo emphasizes on high-margin products as they have been depicting strong growth globally. During first-half fiscal 2017, the company’s premium brands delivered growth of approximately 6% while the super deluxe brands rose 5%. In accordance with this strategy, management resorted to disposing less productive brands and non-core assets.Bottom LineDiageo has been witnessing unfavorable trends in the beer category. Nevertheless, robust growth in the spirits segment is expected to more than offset dismal beer sales in the forthcoming periods. Also, the company’s consistent efforts to progress in the alcohol industry by adapting with evolving trends look promising.Zacks Editor-in-Chief Goes ""All In"" on This StockFull disclosure, Kevin Matras now has more of his own money in one particular stock than in any other.

The company seems to be on a roll owing to its strategic initiatives, robust brand strength, stellar second-quarter fiscal 2018 results and an upbeat outlook for the fiscal year. Also, management remains confident of continuing its growth in the second half of fiscal 2018. Earnings per share are now envisioned in the range of $1.90-$1.98 for fiscal 2018 compared with the previous guidance of $1.85-$1.95.Consequently, the stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2018 being revised five cents upward at $1.97 and raised 12 cents to $2.17 for fiscal 2019 over the past 30 days.Armed with a sturdy portfolio of globally recognized brands, Brown-Forman is a major producer and distributor of premium alcoholic beverages in the world.

Also, management remains committed to a three-point growth plan focused on reviving its Samuel Adams and Angry Orchard brands, cost-saving initiatives and long-term innovation. Moreover, the company’s brand-building efforts and endeavors to add new products remain key revenue drivers. We expect the company’s continued focus on pricing, product innovation as well as brand development to boost its operational performance and position in the market.Notably, the company’s third-quarter 2017 results delivered a positive earnings surprise for four straight quarters with a second consecutive sales beat. It has recorded an impressive average earnings outperformance of 63.4% in the trailing four quarters. The stock’s VGM Score of B with a long-term earnings growth rate of 5% further buoys optimism in the stock.Looking For More Stocks Gaining From the Industry TrendsSome other top-ranked alcohol stocks having outpaced the industry with a favorable Zacks Rank are Constellation Brands, Inc. (STZ  -  Free Report) and Diageo plc (DEO  -  Free Report), both carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).We note that shares of Constellation Brands and Diageo have gained 17.2% and 19.8%, respectively, in the last six months.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

Further, the company registered organic revenue growth of 3.6% on the back of a 5.4% rise in revenues per hectoliter (hl) on a constant geographic basis.

Global brands revenues for the quarter comprised 9.6% growth at Corona and 0.9% rise in Stella Artois, partially offset by 2.2% decline at Budweiser. Growth at Corona can be attributed to 11.2% revenue growth outside Mexico, including strength in China, Colombia and Ecuador. Meanwhile, revenue growth at Stella Artois was driven by persistent strength in Argentina and Brazil. While Budweiser revenues declined year over year, it included a 4.4% growth outside the United States, led by Brazil, South Korea and Chile.Total volumes dipped 1.2%, including a 1.5% fall in the beer volumes. Gains from volume growth in Mexico, Argentina, and Africa were more than offset by lower shipment volumes in the United States due to unfavorable weather conditions, alongside a decline in Brazil.Cost of sales escalated 26.2% year over year to $5,546 million, while organically the same declined 1.9%. Organic cost of sales per hl fell 0.5% due to better synergies and favorable emerging market exchange rates.

As the company remains well on track with the SABMiller integration, it raised the synergy and cost savings guidance by $400 million to $3.2 billion. These synergies are expected to be realized in four years from the close of the acquisition (or by October 2020).Owing to greater volatility in some of its core regions, AB InBev still projects revenue growth in 2017 to be backed by robust growth of global brands and strong commercial plans, including revenues management initiatives.For 2017, AB InBev continues to anticipate cost of goods sold per hl, on a constant geographic basis, to increase in the low-single digits range, in spite of adverse currency movements and premium brands growth. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses are estimated to remain flat, driven by savings in overhead costs that will be reinvested to boost strength of its brands. Management expects normalized effective tax rate for 2017 in the range of 22-24%.Additionally, AB InBev anticipates incurring nearly $3.7 billion as net capital expenditure for 2017.

26,BF.B,"Constellation Brands, Inc. (STZ  -  Free Report) is one of those stocks that never lets investors down. Backed by its strategic growth initiatives, this alcohol behemoth has put up a spectacular show in the past. The company’s superb earnings record and ongoing prospects are also visible from its stock price performance.Evidently, the company has surged a whopping 40.5% so far this year, outperforming the industry’s 26.8% growth. So let’s take a detailed look at the factors that are most likely to keep driving this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock’s momentum.Focus on Enhancing Brand Portfolio Leads to Solid Market PositionConstellation Brands has a formidable portfolio of well-known brands and is the largest wine company in the world. The company holds a dominant position in the premium wine and beer segment in the United States, alongside being a leading producer of wine in Canada and New Zealand. This provides it with a competitive edge and also bolsters its well-established position in the market. Further, the company’s consistent focus on brand building and initiatives to include new products remain key revenue drivers for the stock.Beer Business Strength Fuels GrowthThanks to its strategic endeavors, the company is witnessing increasing market share, especially in the U.S. beer category. Notably, the company was the highest growth contributor in the United States’ beer category for the fourth straight year, in fiscal 2017. Also, Constellation Brands is focused on expanding in the craft beer space, which has become a solid growth avenue in the beer space. In this regard, management expects solid results from its Ballast Point craft beer brand, which is currently placed among the top 20 craft brands nationwide. Also, confidence in the beer business was one of the major drivers of the company’s recently raised outlook, as discussed below.Expansion Initiatives Bode WellConstellation Brands focuses on expanding operations directed toward achieving business growth. In the beer segment, the company’s expansion plans are anchored by the recent acquisition of the Funky Buddha Brewery, a leading craft brewery in Florida; the introduction of Fathom IPA by Ballast Point Brewery and the Obregon Brewery buyout among others. The company also sees immense growth potential for its spirits and wines business. Evidently, Constellation Brands acquired America’s highest rated Schrader Cellars in June  to enhance its fine wines kitty. Also, in fiscal 2017, the company purchased and integrated High West Distillery, Charles Smith Wines and The Prisoner Wine Company brands.Q2 Retains Stellar Surprise History, Outlook Boosts EstimatesThe aforementioned factors are enough to decipher Constellation Brands’ past record.  Notably, the company’s second-quarter fiscal 2018 earnings marked its 12th straight earnings beat and 17th consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvement. Moreover, the top line improved year over year and returned to a beat trend. Management remained encouraged by the outstanding results, which was marked by significant market share gains, margin expansion, strong free cash flow and solid execution. This along with the strength in the beer business led the company to raise earnings outlook for fiscal 2018. Management also raised fiscal 2018 operating income targets for the beer segment.Constellation Brands Inc Price and Consensus  Constellation Brands Inc Price and Consensus | Constellation Brands Inc Quote The splendid quarter and encouraging outlook have also perked up the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Over the past 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2018 and 2019 has risen to $8.43 and $9.28, from $8.16 and $9.14 respectively.

29,BF.B,"Shares of Brown-Forman Corporation (BF.B  -  Free Report) have been rallying, driven by an impressive surprise history and a positive outlook for fiscal 2018. Further, the company is favored due to its solid brand portfolio, expansion plans and shareholder-friendly moves.This led to an upsurge in the stock price. Notably, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has rallied 23.5% in the past year, outperforming 1.1% growth recorded by the industry.Robust Surprise TrendBrown-Forman has delivered an earnings beat in the trailing four quarters, with an average of 11.7%. Further, the company reported year-over-year earnings and sales growth in fourth-quarter fiscal 2018. Also, it was the seventh straight quarter of growth in underlying sales, driven by persistent momentum in its focus categories and strength in Jack Daniel’s, led by premium American whiskey portfolio. Further, net sales gained from balanced growth across geographies and the company’s portfolio.Favorable OutlookLooking ahead, the company is confident of capitalizing on its strategy for American Whiskey while benefiting from investments in its brands’ portfolio over the years. Consequently, the company expects to deliver yet another strong year, with solid earnings in fiscal 2019, backed by strength in its business and gains from the tax reform.In fiscal 2019, the company estimates earnings per share of $1.75-$1.85 per share, reflecting 18-25% increase. This includes the tax rate of 21% and negative impact of 5 cents from higher interest expenses, foreign exchange and expected changes in inventories. Moreover, the company projects underlying sales growth of 6-7%.Expansion Plans Bode WellBrown-Forman plans to expand Jack Daniel's market share in developed markets, including France and the United States, and in emerging markets like Russia, Poland and Mexico, where the whiskey category is in the early stages of development. The company is on track to expand the sphere of its brands, such as Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey, Jack Daniel’s Fire, Gentleman Jack and Jack Daniel's Single Barrel, all within Jack Daniel’s portfolio.Further, the company has entered the fastest-growing spirit category — Irish whiskey — with the purchase of all the shares of Slane Castle Irish Whiskey Limited in Ireland. In another development, the company acquired two historic properties at West Main Street in Louisville, KY, to boost its Old Forester brand.Will Jack Daniel’s Price Hike in Europe Hurt Performance?While the above discussion clearly shows the company’s solid performance, the recent imposition of 25% tariff increase on U.S. whiskeys is a concern for the American spirits suppliers, particularly Brown-Forman. The tariff hike, which is in retaliation to the Trump administration’s decision to impose tariffs on European steel and aluminum, is likely to result in 10% increase in prices for Brown-Forman’s Jack Daniel’s Tennessee whiskey in Europe. The price increase, which is likely to take effect after a couple of months, is anticipated to lower demand and imports of Jack Daniel’s in Europe. This could significantly impact the company’s top line as Europe accounts for nearly one-fourth of its revenues.The anticipation of such tariffs in the pipeline and the final announcement has shown a visible impact on the stock price of Brown-Forman. The company has declined nearly 3% yesterday while the stock has decreased 14.9% in the past month.Bottom LineThough concerns regarding the tariff increase remain, Brown-Forman’s ongoing strategies provide visibility for growth in the future.Do Beverages-Alcohol Stocks Grab Your Attention?

32,BF.B,"Brown-Forman Corporation (BF.B  -  Free Report), the leading producer and distributor of premium alcoholic beverages, is set to report first-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Aug 30, before the market opens. Investors are keen to know whether the company will post a positive earnings surprise in the to-be-reported quarter, after missing the same in the preceding two quarters. In the trailing four quarters, Brown-Forman has posted average negative earnings surprise of 2.5%.Brown Forman Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Brown Forman Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Brown Forman Corporation QuoteLet’s now have a look at how things are shaping up for this announcement.What to Expect?The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is 39 cents, reflecting a year-over year growth of 7.8%. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has been stable in the past 30 days. However, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $688.7 million, up about 4.2% from the year-ago quarter.Factors at PlayBrown-Forman gains strength from its strong portfolio of premium American whiskey brands, along with its Jack Daniel's trademark. The company expects to grow on the back of strong demand for its authentic American whiskey brands worldwide, consumer interest in flavored whiskey and a growing trend in premium spirits. Its consistent focus on pricing, product innovation and expansion reinforce its market position.However, the company has been witnessing a rough phase due to its dismal earnings and sales trend, primarily hurt by currency headwinds. Notably, the company has lagged earnings and sales estimates in three of the trailing four quarters. Further, Brown-Forman forecasts currency headwinds to continue in fiscal 2018 and are likely to negatively impact earnings and sales. The company also anticipates the volatility in global economy and the competitive landscape to continue to hurt results.The cumulative effect of this dismal trend is visible on the company’s stock price, which has witnessed a 6.3% decline in the last three months. This also compares unfavorably with the industry’s 3.1% growth.What Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Brown-Forman to beat earnings estimates this quarter.

33,BF.B,"Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (BUD  -  Free Report), commonly known as AB InBev has failed to impress investors lately owing to its dismal performance. The company is battling soft volumes, higher cost of sales, adverse currency impacts and consumers’ changing preferences.A look at AB InBev’s share price reveals that it has lost 6.3% in the past three months, as against the Beverages – Alcoholic industry’s growth of 2.3%. Currently, the industry ranks in the top 46% (118 out of 256) of the Zacks classified industries. The stock has also underperformed the broader Consumer Staples sector’s gain of 3.2%. In fact, a VGM Score of D further raises concerns for this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) stock.  What’s Troubling the Stock?AB InBev has been disappointing investors with its dismal earnings surprise history. Apparently, it had delivered seventh consecutive negative earnings surprise in third-quarter 2017. In the trailing four quarters, the company reported an average negative earnings surprise of 28.4%. Moreover, revenues missed estimates for the second consecutive quarter.Results in the quarter were somewhat hurt by volume declines, escalated cost of sales and revenues decline at Budweiser brand. Unfortunately, management believes that cost of sales will continue to rise owing to the lingering currency woes and growth of premium brands. Management also anticipates that some of its core regions will remain volatile. These factors are likely to dent the company’s performance.In fact, analysts are becoming bearish on the stock as evident from the downtrend in the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The estimates of $4.22 for 2017 and $5.18 for 2018 have moved down by a penny and 4 cents, respectively, in the past 30 days.Further, consumers’ shifting preference toward booming craft spirits in the United States might take a toll on the growth of the company’s Budweiser brand. Apparently, in the last quarter, Budweiser brand’s revenues fell 2.2%.Also, the beer and beverage industry remains susceptible to unfavorable changes in taxes. Thus, any rise in excise taxes or indirect taxes might weigh on AB InBev’s revenues and margins.Can AB InBev Return to Growth Trajectory?Armed with a robust brand portfolio and solid geographic reach, AB InBev keeps introducing near-beer alternatives, along with no- and low-alcohol beers to address the evolving consumers’ preference. Also, the company is poised to gain a dominant share in the global beer market from SABMiller’s buyout.We also expect the company to benefit from its constant efforts of expansion in the craft beer space, given the rising demand for this beer category. Though the expansion might take time, we believe that AB InBev will return to its growth trajectory backed by its strength of Budweiser brand and robust initiatives.Stocks Gaining From Alcohol Industry TrendsThe alcohol market in the United States has been on an expansion spree, owing to strong demand. Also, the alcohol industry is poised to benefit from the holiday season and a buoyant U.S. economy. Markedly, the Alcohol industry recorded 23% growth over a year, ahead of the 19.6% upside of the S&P 500 market.Here are some alcohol stocks that have outperformed the industry and hold a favorable Zacks Rank. These are Brown-Forman Corporation (BF.B  -  Free Report) sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), and Constellation Brands, Inc. (STZ  -  Free Report) and The Boston Beer Company, Inc. (SAM  -  Free Report) carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), each.

This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock also exhibits a Growth Score of B with an impressive long-term earnings growth rate of 18.4%.Let’s dive deep into the factors that are pushing the stock higher.Robust Surprise History and OutlookConstellation Brands has to its credit a robust surprise history. Apparently, the company’s second-quarter fiscal 2018 earnings marked 12th straight earnings beat and 17th consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvement. Also, the top line outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in seven of the trailing eight quarters.Meanwhile, management remains encouraged with the superb second-quarter results, which was reflected in significant market share gains, margin expansion, strong free cash flow and solid execution. This along with strength in the beer business led management to raise earnings outlook for fiscal 2018, which is envisioned in the range of $8.25-$8.40 per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fiscal is pegged higher at $8.43.Focus on Business ExpansionConstellation Brands remains focused on expanding operations directed toward achieving business growth. In the beer segment, the company’s expansion plans are anchored by the acquisition of the Funky Buddha Brewery; the introduction of Fathom IPA by Ballast Point Brewery; the Obregon Brewery acquisition, which will bolster its high-end Mexican beer portfolio; the faster-than-expected 25 million hectares expansion of its Nava brewery in Mexico; and the construction of the East Coast brewery in Belleville, VA.Moreover, the company is on track with its glass plant expansion. It also sees immense growth potential for its spirits and wines business, which in turn might prove to be beneficial.Brand StrengthArmed with a formidable portfolio of well-known brands, Constellation Brands is the leading wine company in the world.

Moreover, the S&P 500 posted its third straight day of losses. The Dow and the Nasdaq also ended in the red after suffering broad based losses. Meanwhile, the ISM Service Index for November declined from the 12 year high it had hit a month earlier.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) decreased 0.5%, to close at 24,180.64. However, the S&P 500 Index (INX) fell 0.4% to close at 2,629.57. The tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index (IXIC) closed at 6,762.21, losing 0.2%.

The CBOE VIX decreased 0.9% to close at 11.58.Investors Assess Changes Made to Tax BillEarly Saturday, U.S. Senate Republicans passed the much awaited tax Bill after they won a vote 51 to 49 to pass the tax overhaul bill in the Senate. According to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, corporate tax rate will be reduced to 20% from 35%, while companies will be allowed to pay a 5% tax on reinvested earnings and 10% tax on deferred cash earnings.However, this Bill included a last-minute amendment which does not repeal the corporate alternative minimum tax or AMT, a proposal which was part of the draft legislation. Such an amendment places the Senate’s Tax Bill at loggerheads with the Republican Bill because members of the GOP want this facet removed in the final legislation.Economists have stated that if AMT is included in the final version of the Bill, it would weigh heavily on corporate earnings and tax reforms would not turn not to be beneficial for large-cap corporations, the likes of which include big tech companies.

37,BF.B,"The Boston Beer Co. Inc. (SAM  -  Free Report) has been exhibiting consistent growth as evident from its stock movement, which has hardly witnessed a dip in quite some time. The company’s strong performance can be attributed to its three point growth plan focused on revival of Samuel Adams and Angry Orchard brands, cost saving initiatives and long-term innovation. Additionally, the company is poised to gain from industry growth trends.Recent observations reveal that alcohol sales trends have been witnessing a change, with a rise in demand for more flavored products like the honey and cinnamon flavored whiskeys and higher-priced tequilas. The industry has recently witnessed the spirits segment gathering momentum, accounting for about 36% of the total alcohol market, seizing share from beer and wine sales.However, beer still accounts for 47% of the market share as craft beer and Mexican imports remained popular throughout 2016 and into 2017. We believe Boston Beer is well-positioned to gain from these ongoing industry trends.This largest craft brewer in the United States has seen its shares advance 30.9% in the last three months, outpacing the industry’s upside of 11%. Currently, the industry is placed at the top 39% of the Zacks classified industries (103 out of 265). In fact, the company’s shares have substantially outperformed the broader Consumer Staples sector’s gain of 1.4%, which is placed at the top 38% (6 out of 16) of the Zacks classified sectors.These factors have aided the company to retain the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), while carrying a VGM Score of A. That said, let’s find out more about the factors aiding this Boston, MA-based company’s performance.Strong Brands Portfolio Provides an EdgeBoston Beer is the largest premium craft brewer in the United States, and commands a strong portfolio of globally recognized brands. Apart from selling alcoholic beverages in the United States, the company distributes beverages in Canada, Europe, Israel, Caribbean, Pacific Rim, Mexico, as well as Central and South America through a strong network of wholesale distributors. We expect the company’s continued focus on pricing, product innovation and brand development to boost operational performance and position in the market.Robust Earnings Trend and Outlook Stirs OptimismBoston Beer reported third straight earnings beat in second-quarter 2017, while sales returned to growth after three consecutive misses. Results benefited from top-line gains accompanied by gross margin improvement and lower operating costs owing to the company’s cost saving initiatives. Further, gross margins expanded in the quarter attributable to higher revenues per barrel that resulted from better pricing and package mix, along with lower brewery processing cost per barrel due to cost saving initiatives.Boston Beer Company, Inc. (The) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Boston Beer Company, Inc. (The) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Boston Beer Company, Inc. (The) QuoteMoreover, the company raised the lower-end of its previously stated guidance range. The company now estimates adjusted earnings per share in the range of $5.00-$6.20 compared with the prior guidance of $4.20-$6.20.Strategic Actions Keep it GoingManagement remains committed to a three point growth plan focused on revival of its Samuel Adams and Angry Orchard brands, cost saving initiatives and long-term innovation. One, the company is keen on the revival of the Samuel Adams and Angry Orchard brands via its packaging, innovation, promotion and brand communication initiatives. Further, it targets maintaining momentum for the Twisted Tea brand.Two, the company has accelerated focus on cost savings and efficiency projects, while ensuring that these savings are directed for further brand development. In this regard, the company has adjusted the organization to the new volume environment, while at the same time retained its capability to innovate and return to growth. This is reflected in the improved gross margin and increased spending on brands in second-quarter 2017. Based on this early success, the company continues to anticipate improving gross margin by one percentage point every year through 2019.The company’s third priority is long-term innovation, wherein its focus currently revolves around maintaining the leadership of its Truly Spiked & Sparkling brand and ensuring it reaches full potential.Additionally, Boston Beer always seeks strategic opportunities to expand business through inorganic means. The company’s past record reveals that it believes in reinvesting its profits toward capital expenditures rather than distributing the same to shareholders. Since its inception, the company has made significant investments toward acquiring brewing assets, enhancing research & development (R&D) as well as packaging and marketing of products. The company mainly focuses on acquiring assets which can fulfill its goal of enhancing brewing capacity as well as expanding into new geographic regions.Possible DeterrentsWhile all is well with this renowned beer company, its depletion trends continued to be soft due to persistent decline in the Samuel Adams and Angry Orchard brands, as well as fall in Coney Island. Further, challenges related to a competitive retail backdrop persist. The company continues to project soft depletion trends for 2017.Nevertheless, we suggest holding on to the stock at this time as the aforementioned concerns are mostly addressed by its strategic actions, which focuses on reviving the distressed brands.Want More of Beverage Stocks?

41,BF.B,"The Boston Beer Company Inc. (SAM  -  Free Report) witnessed significant momentum since reporting solid first-quarter 2017 earnings on Apr 25, 2018. The company’s upside story relates to continued progress on its strategic initiatives. We remain encouraged by Boston Beer’s three-point growth plan, focused on cost-saving initiatives, long-term innovation, and the revival of Samuel Adams and Angry Orchard brands.Stock SurgesShares of Boston Beer have increased 6.8% in the past month against the industry’s decline of 6.3%. However, the stock has witnessed growth of 9.4% after reporting solid results on Apr 25 while the industry declined 4%.Boston Beer delivered earnings and sales beat in first-quarter 2018, marking its fifth earnings beat in the last six quarters and the third positive sales surprise in the trailing four quarters. Bottom line gained from solid revenue growth as well as higher gross margin, somewhat negated by rise in advertising, promotion and selling expenses. Results gained from gross-margin improvement, lower operating costs, owing to the company’s cost-saving initiatives, as well as lower tax rate. Meanwhile, sales benefited from improved shipment volumes and depletions.The Boston Beer Company, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise The Boston Beer Company, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | The Boston Beer Company, Inc. QuoteLet’s find out more about the growth drivers for this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock.Strategic Initiatives ImpressThe company remains committed to the three-point growth plan, focused on cost-saving initiatives, long-term innovation, and the revival of its Samuel Adams and Angry Orchard brands. Firstly, it plans to revive the Samuel Adams brand through packaging, innovation, promotion and brand-communication initiatives. Further, it remains keen on retaining Angry Orchard and Twisted Tea’s momentum while ensuring Truly Spiked & Sparkling's leadership position in the hard sparkling-water category. Efforts to improve trends at Samuel Adams comprise its integrated 'Fill Your Glass' marketing campaign alongside sales execution of its Samuel Adams initiative, Sam ’76. Additionally, the company is focused on making more investments in Angry Orchard media in the second quarter.Secondly, the company accelerated its focus on cost savings and efficiency projects with these savings directed for further brand development. Based on current opportunities, the company continues to anticipate improving gross margin by one percentage point every year through 2019. The company’s third priority is long-term innovation and maximizing the shareholder value. Boston Beer remains optimistic about the future of craft beer and cider categories.Improving Depletion TrendsBoston Beer’s top-line gains in the first quarter were driven by 15% improvement in shipment volumes and 8% depletions growth. In the reported quarter, depletion primarily gained from increases in Twisted Tea, Truly Spiked & Sparkling, and Angry Orchard brands, partially offset by the fall in the Samuel Adams brand. Depletions for the year-to-date period through the 15-weeks period, ended Apr 14, 2018, are estimated to have grown nearly 8% from the comparable year-ago period. For 2018, depletions and shipments are likely to range from flat to up 6%.Cost Savings Aid Gross MarginsBoston Beer is making strides to address industry challenges through improved cost structure and re-investing these savings for brand development. This has been significantly contributing toward improving gross margin. In 2017, the company’s cost savings and efficiency projects delivered above the targeted ranges, providing increased flexibility to invest in brands. This positions the company well for 2018. Gross margin improved 330 basis points (bps) in the first quarter, driven by better pricing, product and package mix, and favorable fixed-cost absorption along with cost-savings gains from the company-owned breweries. For 2018, the company expects gross margins between 52% and 54%, driven by continued progress on cost-saving initiatives.Do Consumer Staples Stocks Grab Your Attention?

The company now projects sales growth of nearly 3%, which is at the high-end of its previous guidance of 1-3%. The guidance includes the contribution of 1 point from the Nutranext acquisition and an estimated 3-point gain from product innovation.2020 Strategy Bodes WellClorox is progressing with the smooth execution of its 2020 Strategy, which is aimed at boosting growth for the improvement of categories and overall market share.

The company is on track to meet its 2020 target of generating $500 million of e-commerce sales.Possible DeterrentsThough earnings and sales topped estimates in third-quarter fiscal 2018, the soft-margin trend continued to be a headwind. The company witnessed significant pressure on gross margin in the reported quarter, owing to elevated commodity and logistics expenses, which are likely to continue hurting margins in fiscal 2018. Driven by the soft margins, the company also trimmed its earnings guidance for fiscal 2018.Final ThoughtsClorox’s robust earnings trend, as well as growth strategies, positions it for growth ahead. However, soft margins may be a hurdle to earnings growth in the near-term, keeping investors worried.Do Consumer Staples Stocks Grab Your Attention?

43,BF.B,"Brown-Forman Corporation (BF.B  -  Free Report) has been witnessing a rough phase, primarily due to its dismal earnings trend, weak fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results along with other major concerns like currency headwinds. However, management is trying hard to revive and remains encouraged by its Jack Daniel's family of brands, premium bourbon and tequila brands.Let’s explore the pros and cons of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company.Dismal PerformanceBrown-Forman’s fiscal fourth quarter marked its second straight earnings miss, and third in the trailing four quarters. In fact, it recorded an average negative earnings surprise of 2.5% in the last four quarters, which also includes a quarter where earnings met the estimates. In addition, the company’s top line lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in 13 of the last 16 quarters, including the recently reported quarter.In the fiscal fourth quarter, results were hurt by the acquisition and divestiture activity, alongside currency headwinds and lower distributor inventory levels. Also, sales were marred by the divestiture of Southern Comfort and Tuaca in fiscal 2016. Moreover, operating income plummeted 71% to $212 million, with operating margin contracting substantially to 30.5% from 99.5% in the year-ago quarter. However, operating margin rose 13% on an underlying basis.Further, earnings for fiscal 2018 are anticipated in the range of $1.80–$1.90 per share, including a modest negative influence from foreign currency headwinds, higher tax rate and the establishment of owned distribution center in Spain. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged higher at $1.85 for the fiscal year.Consequently, Brown-Forman’s shares declined 8.3% since it reported earnings results on Jun 7. In fact, the stock dipped 1.8% in the last month against its industry’s rally of 2.3%. Currently, the industry is placed at top 9% of the Zacks Classified industries (23 out of 256).Other HeadwindsThe company remains prone to adverse currency translations, which hurt its top-line growth in the fiscal fourth quarter by 3% and fiscal 2017 by 2%. Going forward, management continues to feel the pinch of currency headwinds and forecasts the same to dent its fiscal 2018 earnings.Brown-Forman’s performance is also challenged by the excise tax levied on distilled spirits by governments of respective countries. Volatile global economic and geopolitical environment, coupled with competitive pressures further add to the woes.Growth AvenuesArmed with a strong portfolio of globally recognized brands, Brown-Forman gains strength from its premium American whiskey brands, along with its Jack Daniel's trademark. The company expects to grow on the back of strong demand for its authentic American whiskey brands worldwide, consumer interest in flavored whiskey and a growing trend in premium spirits. Further, its consistent focus on pricing, product innovation and expansion strengthen its market position.Brown-Forman vs. IndustryBottom LineSo let’s wait and see if Brown-Forman can counter the hurdles and able to spark a turnaround. Meanwhile, investors might focus on some better-ranked stocks in the same industry, including Constellation Brands, Inc. (STZ  -  Free Report), Ambev S.A. (ABEV  -  Free Report) and The Boston Beer Company, Inc.

44,BF.B,"It has been more than a month since the last earnings report for Brown Forman Corporation (BF.B  -  Free Report). Shares have added about 2.4% in that time frame, outperforming the market.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Brown-Forman Q1 Earnings Top on Strong SalesBrown-Forman’s adjusted earnings of 46 cents in first-quarter fiscal 2018 jumped nearly 27% and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 39 cents.Net sales improved about 9% year over year to $723 million, after deducting excise taxes.

However, underlying gross profit improved 6%.Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses dipped 1% from the year-ago quarter figure to $161 million, both on a reported and underlying basis. This was mainly driven by stringent cost controls.However, advertising expenses rose 9% year over year to $89 million, while underlying advertising costs increased 6%. The rise in advertising costs is attributed to rise in investments for the Jack Daniels family of brands and further growth of the fast growing bourbon and tequila brands.Nevertheless, operating income grew 14% to $244 million, with operating margin expanding 150 bps to 33.7%. On an underlying basis, operating income increased 12%.Balance Sheet & Cash FlowBrown-Forman ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $238 million, long-term debt of $1,720 million and total debt of $1,978 million.

The dividend is payable on Oct 2, 2017, to shareholders on record as of Sep 7.Fiscal 2018 GuidanceGoing forward, the company expects the volatile global economic and geopolitical environment, particularly in the emerging markets as well as intensified competition in the developed economies to hinder results. However, the company remains confident of persistent growth in underlying net sales and operating income in fiscal 2018 and consequently reiterated guidance. Moreover, the company raised earnings per share projections for the fiscal.Management continues to project 4-5% growth in underlying sales mainly backed by growth of its premium American whiskey and tequila brands, comprising innovation for Jack Daniel’s RTDs. Further, growth is likely to come from new product launches including the Jack Daniel's Tennessee Rye and Slane Irish Whiskey.The company expects SG&A expense on an underlying basis to remain flat, driven by smooth execution of cost-control initiatives.Underlying operating income is anticipated to increase in range of 6-8%. Further, the company now estimates earnings per share in the range of $1.85-$1.95, compared with the previous guidance of $1.80-$1.90. The company’s revised earnings forecast assumes a tax rate of nearly 28% and gains from the recently reversed impact of foreign currency. For fiscal 2018, the company anticipates slight foreign currency tailwinds to benefit results.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?Analysts were quiet during the past month as none of them issued any earnings estimate revisions.Brown Forman Corporation Price and Consensus  Brown Forman Corporation Price and Consensus | Brown Forman Corporation QuoteVGM ScoresAt this time, the stock stock has a nice Growth Score of B, though it is lagging a bit on the momentum front with a C.

It currently owns and produces a multitude of popular spirit brands, with Jack Daniels and Finlandia Vodka topping the list. Moreover, we expect the company’s continued focus on pricing, product innovation and expanding operations in emerging markets to boost its operational performance, and strengthen its market position.Expanding Operations & Premium BrandsBrown-Forman plans to expand Jack Daniel's market share in the developed markets, such as France and the United States as well as in the emerging markets like Russia, Poland, and Mexico, where the whiskey category is in the early stages of development. Also, management is on track to expand the sphere of other brands, such as Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey, Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Fire, Gentleman Jack and Jack Daniel's Single Barrel within Jack Daniel’s. Furthermore, Brown-Forman has entered the fastest-growing spirit category, the Irish Whiskey, by purchasing all of Ireland-based Slane Castle Irish Whiskey Limited’s shares.

In fact, the quarterly results also grew year over year. Additionally, the quarter marked the sixth straight period of growth in underlying sales, driven by persistent momentum in its focus categories and strength in Jack Daniel’s led by premium American whiskey portfolio. Further, net sales gained from balanced growth across geographies. Notably, management believes that it is on track to deliver high-quality, top-tier results in fiscal 2018. The company’s earnings and cash flows are anticipated to benefit in the future owing to the new tax reform. All these efforts are likely to add value to the company’s fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 results.Wrapping UpWe believe that Brown-Forman will sustain the momentum and continue gaining investors’ confidence on the back of all these above-mentioned robust endeavors.Want More of Consumer Staples Stocks?

46,BF.B,"Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (BUD  -  Free Report), alias AB InBev, reported first-quarter 2018 results, wherein earnings lagged estimates while sales topped. This marked the company’s return to the negative earnings surprise trend, after recording a beat in the preceding quarter. With this, the company delivered negative earnings surprise in eight of the last nine quarters. Moreover, revenues surpassed estimates for the second straight quarter, reflecting a beat in four of the last six quarters.Overall, shares of AB InBev have lost 9.3% in the past month, wider than the industry's decline of 5.6%.Q1 HighlightsNormalized earnings per share of 73 cents declined from 74 cents in the year-ago quarter. The bottom line also lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 79 cents.Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV QuoteRevenues improved 1.2% to $13,073 million, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $12,829 million. The company registered organic revenue growth of 4.7%, courtesy of 5.3% rise in revenues per hectoliter (hl) on a constant-geographic basis. The increase stemmed from ongoing revenue management initiatives along with the strong performance of premium brands. Also, revenues per hl advanced 4.9% on a reported basis.Consolidated revenues at the company’s three global brands — Budweiser, Corona and Stella Artois -- improved 7.9% globally and 12.2% outside home markets.Total volumes dipped 0.2% with own-beer volumes rising 0.5%, offset by a 6.9% decline in non-beer volumes. Own-beer volumes gained from growth in Mexico, Colombia and Argentina, partly mitigated by softness in the United States and Brazil. On the other hand, non-beer volumes were mainly hurt by the weakness in Brazil and Peru.Cost of sales dropped 4.6% year over year to $4,988 million while the same rose 1.3% organically. Further, cost of sales per hl grew 1.5%. On a constant-geographic basis, cost of sales per hl increased 2.4%.The company’s normalized earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) were $4,989 million, up 3.7% year over year and grew 6.6% on an organic basis. The increase was driven by solid top-line growth as well as gains from cost synergies, partly negated by higher sales and marketing expenses ahead of the FIFA World Cup along with a fall in other operating income due to difficult comparisons. EBITDA margin expanded 100 basis points (bps) to 38.2% while the same increased 70 bps organically.OutlookAB InBev issued guidance for 2018. Though management sees volatility in certain key markets, it anticipates delivering strong top-line and EBITDA growth for the full year, backed by solid brands performance and robust commercial plans. In fact, driven by the company’s growth model that focuses on category development, net revenues per hl growth is likely to exceed inflation while costs are expected to come below inflation.With first-quarter results, coming slightly ahead of initial expectations, the company expects accelerated growth through the rest of 2018, particularly in the second half.Nonetheless, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company reiterated the synergy and cost-savings guidance of $3.2 billion that was announced in August 2016. With the majority of the synergies already captured, the company expects to achieve synergies of nearly $900 million in the next 2-3 years.For 2018, management anticipates normalized effective tax rate of 24-26%. Net capital expenditures are projected between $4 billion and $4.5 billion. AB InBev envisions dividend growth to be modest in the future.Three Hot Picks in the Beverages – Alcohol SpaceSome better-ranked stocks in the same industry are The Boston Beer Company, Inc.

47,BF.B,"Even though the picture appears rosy for the U.S. economy, this favorable economic landscape can divert investors’ focus from the defensive consumer staples zone to other seemingly attractive spaces.This is likely one of the explanations for the sector’s recent underperformance, a trend that can remain in place for quite some time. Stocks in the Zacks Consumer Staples sector are down -4% over the last 12 months, lagging the S&P 500 index’s +14.2% gain over the same time period.Continued Fed tightening and higher interest rates also remain an issue for these stocks. This is so for two reasons. First, Consumer Staples stocks, like Utility stocks, are typically dividend payers which tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. Second, Consumer Staples companies have global operations and remain vulnerable to strength in the exchange value of the U.S. dollar. The dollar has started gaining ground lately on account of the Fed and interest rate backdrop.Also, possibility of a trade war with China continues to raise fears for companies whose business operations are likely to be hit by tariffs.Other than this, the consumer staples space is grappling with rising input costs as well as intense competition, with the latter stemming from consumers’ changing preferences and Amazon’s AMZN ever-growing dominance. This, in turn has created significant pricing pressure, alongside compelling companies to undertake aggressive promotional activities. These factors pose major threats to margins, which have been plateaued for quite some time now.That said, we believe that investors must take stock of the possible obstacles in the consumer staples sector before making any investment decision within it.Input Cost Volatility, Escalated Freight CostsInput costs play a major role in determining the performance of a company. An increase in input cost directly hits the company’s margins and profits. Moreover, any price increase to offset the same may drive consumers away. We note that many Consumer Staples companies are bearing the brunt of high input costs, which remains a concern for the future. Also, the food industry in general is battling a tough transportation landscape due to lower driver availability.This, in turn, has raised freight costs for many players like Smucker’s (SJM  -  Free Report), Pinnacle Foods (PF  -  Free Report), United Natural UNPI and Sysco SYS, among others. In fact, most of these companies expect higher freight costs to remain a threat to their margins.Moving to higher commodity costs, consumer goods behemoth Colgate has been bearing the brunt of increased commodity and packaging costs, which have been hurting its gross margin. Input cost inflation also remains a cause of concern for players like Campbell Soup CPB, Dean Foods DF, Molson Coors (TAP  -  Free Report), Pinnacle Foods, Church & Dwight CHD and Kimberly-Clark KMB. In fact, Kimberly expects commodity costs to shoot up mainly due to higher prices for several raw materials, including pulp. As for Church & Dwight, it expects both higher commodity and transportation expenses to weigh on gross margin in 2018. Sysco and Pinnacle Foods are other examples that remain troubled by both these headwinds.Intense CompetitionConsumer staples companies face stiff competition with respect to innovation, pricing, brand strength, promotions and responsiveness to evolving consumer trends. This results in lower pricing power and a decline in market share, which in turn compresses margins and earnings. For example, Kimberly-Clark’s diaper segment faces significant competitive activity, which puts the company’s market share at risk.Dean Foods also battles stiff competition, not only with various dairy processors for shelf space, but also with various beverages and nutritional products. Further, the beauty and beauty-related products industry is highly competitive, which remains a challenge for players like Avon Products AVP and Coty COTY. Results of alcohol giants like Constellation Brands (STZ  -  Free Report) and Brown-Forman BF.B may also be somewhat stifled in a cut-throat competitive environment.Strained Margins Many companies in the consumer staples sector have been plagued by strained margins, stemming from various factors. These include tough grocery market conditions, rising input costs, costs associated with meeting consumers’ changing demands and stiff competition that leads to aggressive promotions and price wars. From grocery chains like SUPERVALU (SVU  -  Free Report), food companies like Campbell Soup, cosmetic biggies like Estee Lauder to consumer products companies like Church & Dwight, Colgate CL, Newell Brands (NWL  -  Free Report) and Kimberly-Clark, all remain troubled by squeezed margins.The grocery industry has been grappling with challenges like stiff competition and aggressive promotions, which became more pronounced after Amazon’s takeover of Whole Foods Market. Traditional grocery companies are facing competition from rivals, which are strengthening their franchises and offering alternative outlets for food and other staples. Also, customers are more inclined toward private label products, which are low-cost alternatives to national brands. This, in turn, is hurting food companies.Higher Operating Expenses to Limit ProfitsAs demand for staples is usually consistent, companies strive to increase sales and market share through innovations, promotions and efficient marketing and advertising. Thus, consumer staple companies tend to spend heavily on marketing and advertising. Though advertising strengthens brand appeal and helps to counter competition, it severely hits the profit margins of these companies. Also, efforts to keep up with consumers’ changing needs entail significant costs. In this regard, costs related to e-commerce development and marketing are likely to impact profitability.Companies like Kimberly-Clark, PepsiCo (PEP  -  Free Report) and Procter & Gamble (PG  -  Free Report) have significantly stepped up their investments in marketing, innovation, R&D, supply chain and capacity additions, which may hinder profits. Pinnacle Foods has also been witnessing escalated marketing costs, and expects these barriers to linger.Emerging Market VolatilityThe majority of the global population is clustered in emerging economies. Thus, food/beverage companies are increasingly investing in developing and emerging markets like India, China and Brazil which boast significant growth potential due to relatively low per-capita consumption. Another reason is the burgeoning middle-class population with rising income levels, which in turn is increasing the demand for convenience food and beverages. Though emerging markets offer strong growth prospects, they are generally volatile due to fluctuating currencies and other structural and political issues. Moreover, any unprecedented event that may impact economic conditions in countries like China, Brazil and Russia remains a threat.Soft VolumesMany consumer staples companies are struggling with declining volumes or soft volume growth, which is hurting their top line. Mondelez’s (MDLZ  -  Free Report) volumes have been weak since 2014 due to volume erosion from higher pricing and category weakness because of lower demand. Another company that has long been battling soft volumes is dairy products player, Dean Foods.Apart from this, growing health and wellness consciousness has resulted in volume declines of carbonated drinks of Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report), PepsiCo (PEP  -  Free Report) and Dr. Pepper DPS, while it has also been hurting cigarette volumes of bigwigs like Altria (MO  -  Free Report) and Phillip Morris (PM  -  Free Report). Molson Coors has also been posting soft beer volumes in the United States for quite some time now, on account of difficult industry conditions.Government RestrictionsTobacco companies like Altria Group, Philip Morris and British American Tobacco are facing constant government regulations to make consumers aware of the health hazards associated with tobacco products. Well, government authorities have been brandishing the whip on tobacco players as smoking has become one of the primary causes of heart diseases and cancer. Apart from seeking authorization for any new tobacco product, the FDA has made it mandatory for tobacco companies to use precautionary labels on cigarette packets.Additionally, these companies have been directed to put self-critical advertisements on television and newspapers, particularly emphasizing the addictive nature of cigarettes. To add to the woes, the FDA is bent on drastically reducing nicotine in cigarettes to minimally addictive levels. The initiative was proposed in 2017 but was delayed due to ongoing research. If enacted, low nicotine levels will prove to be disastrous for cigarette manufacturing companies.Moreover, increasing regulatory moves have raised awareness amongst consumers regarding the detrimental effects of tobacco consumption, motivating them to quit smoking. These restrictions have lowered cigarette consumption and significantly dented volumes.While this was for tobacco companies, alcohol stocks also remain vulnerable to government regulations. Distilled spirits are subject to excise tax in various countries. Thus, rising fiscal pressure in the United States, European and emerging markets may lead to increasing risk of a potential excise tax on spirits by governments of the respective countries.Bottom LineThough the consumer staples industry is faced with a number of problems, does the sector have anything to offer to short-term investors?Check out our latest Consumer Staples Outlook for more on the current state of affairs in this market from an earnings perspective and the trend in this important sector of the economy.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

48,BF.B,"Demand for everyday-use products created by operators in the Consumer Staples space doesn’t tend to fluctuate a lot, but it is nevertheless exposed to macroeconomic forces at the margins. As such, the outlook for this space perks up as the outlook for the U.S. and global economy improves.The outlook for the U.S. economy has been favorable for the last several years, with the recent tax legislation expected to add to the longevity of the current U.S. expansion cycle. In addition to the indirect benefits to Consumer Staples companies from the tax cuts, these companies also stand to benefit directly from the legislation, as reflected in the improving earnings outlook for many companies. That said, Consumer Staples operators tend to be global in their operations and as such don’t benefit to the same extent from U.S. tax law changes as the more domestic companies. With growth hard to come by for companies in this mature space, Consumer Staples players have to remain focused on squeezing more out of their operations and coming out with revenue-boosting initiatives, which mainly include efforts to keep pace with the changing consumer patterns.On that note, let’s delve deeper in some of the major growth-driving strategies of the space.Strengthening Product Portfolio via Strategic Alliances, Buyouts Consumer staples companies are regularly undertaking both domestic and international acquisitions to expand their product lines and gain access to new markets. Some of these are also forming partnerships, mostly with larger and better-known companies, to strengthen their distribution networks, diversify portfolios, expand their reach and enhance market positioning. Notably, leveraging each other’s efficiencies creates significant synergies for companies that go for M&A activities.Mergers of Tyson Foods (TSN  -  Free Report) with packaged meat producer The Hillshire Brands (in August 2014); tobacco giants Reynolds American and Lorillard (in June 2015); food giants Kraft Foods Group, Inc. KHC and H.J. Heinz Company (in July 2015) and consumer goods companies Newell Brands (NWL  -  Free Report) and Jarden (in 2016) were the most talked about deals. Belgium-based brewer Anheuser Busch InBev’s BUD buyout of SABMiller in October 2016 also created a buzz in the beverage industry. Apart from this, Molson Coors (TAP  -  Free Report) acquired SABMiller plc’s 58% stake in MillerCoors, which made the former the third-largest brewer in the world, after Anheuser-Busch InBev and Heineken.Cost Cutting and Restructuring InitiativesMost consumer staples companies are implementing cost-reduction initiatives to boost profits. In the latter half of 2017, Tyson Foods announced a Financial Fitness Program, with the objectives of enhancing operating efficiency, reducing overheads and fuelling bottom-line performance. Colgate CL has also been benefiting from its Global Growth and Efficiency Program, which focuses on reducing structural costs in order to improve gross and operating profit, standardizing processes to improve the decision-making procedure and enhance its market share worldwide.Additionally, Sysco’s (SYY  -  Free Report) core strategies for 2020 include plans to optimize business and achieving operational efficacy. We also commend Kimberly Clark’s KMB 2018 Global Restructuring & Focus on Reducing Costs Everywhere (FORCE) programs, which are expected to generate cost savings of more than $2 billion over the next four years. Companies like McCormick MKC, Coca-Cola KO, Molson Coors, Mondelez International MDLZ, Smucker (SJM  -  Free Report), Kellogg K and many others have also been benefiting from significant cost savings and restructuring initiatives to boost earnings.Focus on InnovationInnovation remains the guiding principle of consumer staples companies as it enables them to enhance brand appeal through product differentiation and capture market share across all regions and categories. Thus, companies put a lot of thrust on innovation to upgrade their brands and create differentiated value propositions. Notably, constant innovations supported by efficient marketing are essential for consumer staples companies to stay ahead of competition.As evidence, novelty has been a driving force for consumer product giants like The Procter & Gamble Co. (PG  -  Free Report) and Colgate-Palmolive, and cosmetic majors like Estee Lauder EL. These companies constantly come up with new products that suit changing consumer trends, to tap demand and boost revenues. Also, major food companies like Smucker and Campbell Soup CPB, alcohol stocks like Brown-Forman BF.B and Constellation Brands (STZ  -  Free Report), and even tobacco players like Altria (MO  -  Free Report) and Phillip Morris (PM  -  Free Report) have been adding new products to gain competitive edge and augment market share.Exiting Underperforming Units to Enhance OperationsApart from growing their businesses through buyouts, companies also remain focused on improving their product portfolios through divestitures. Offloading underperforming operations enables the companies to concentrate on the core and profitable areas.For example, as part of its strategic business review following its merger with Jarden, Newell Brands announced plans to sell nearly 10% of its current portfolio, including a major chunk of its Tools segment. This highlights the company’s focus on simplifying its operating structure, alongside highlighting its commitment toward making prudent investments in areas with higher growth potential. Similarly, Unilever (UL  -  Free Report) announced plans to sell its shrinking Spreads business to KKR (in December 2017) to shift concentration on fast-growing products.Adopting E-Commerce Mantra: The Need of the HourWith technology having advanced by leaps and bounds, online shopping has become the order of the day. Thanks to various mobile apps and dot.com business lines, shopping for anything is literally on consumers’ finger-tips. Consumers’ rapid shift to e-marketplace has compelled companies to adopt the e-commerce mantra. Companies like United Naturals (UNFI  -  Free Report), SUPERVALU (SVU  -  Free Report), Campbell Soup and Estee Lauder among others, are striving to enhance e-commerce space, through investments in technology and infrastructure.Driven by these efforts, United Natural Foods’ e-commerce sales jumped almost 28.9% in the second quarter. As for SUPERVALU, the company’s contract with Instacart, along with endeavors to upgrade website and mobile applications underscore its knack to enhance consumer shopping experiences.Transition to Health and Wellness ProductsAs consumer preference is the life blood of Consumer Staples, companies have to adapt to evolving trends to stay strong in the industry. A key trend over the last few years has been the desire for natural and organic products, prompting many players in the space to come out with health and wellness offerings. This is the case with almost all industries in the sector.Apart from this, tobacco companies like Altria and Reynolds American are also adapting to the evolving needs of consumers and have resorted to less harmful alternatives like electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes). To cater to changing consumer preference, Philip Morris launched the much talked about IQOS, a smokeless cigarette in November 2014, aiming to lead the tobacco industry’s push into reduced-risk products. IQOS is anticipated to boost market share and offset declining volumes in traditional cigarette business over the long term.Additionally, rising consumer awareness regarding the harmful impact of toxic chemicals has been driving the market share for organic personal care products too. Consequently, players like Unilever are making solid progress in the natural and organic products category. This is evident from its deal to buy Schmidt’s Naturals that specializes in personal care products such as deodorants, toothpaste and bar soaps. Clearly, these robust efforts are expected to boost the companies’ top line in the future.Clearly, the consumer staples space offers plenty of reasons to be optimistic about it over the long term. So how about investing in the space right now?Check out our latest Consumer Staples Outlook here for more on the current state of affairs in this market from an earnings perspective, and how the trend is looking for this important sector of the economy now.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

49,BF.B,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Brown-Forman Corporation (BF.B  -  Free Report). Shares have added about 3.4% in that time frame.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is BF.B due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Brown-Forman Q3 Earnings & Sales Beat, Revises ViewBrown-Forman delivered robust third-quarter fiscal 2018, wherein both earnings and sales topped estimates. This marked the company’s third straight quarter of earnings and sales beat. Adjusted earnings of 44 cents jumped nearly 15.8% and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 41 cents.Net sales improved about 9% year over year to $878 million, after deducting excise taxes. However, on an underlying basis (excluding negative currency impact and other adjustments), sales increased 6% that marked the sixth straight quarterly growth. Moreover, the company’s sales, before accounting for excise taxes, were $1,156 million, up 9.2% from the prior-year figure of $1,059 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate was pegged at $872.3 million.The company’s robust underlying sales performance can be attributed to the persistent momentum in its focus categories and strength in Jack Daniels led by premium American whiskey portfolio. Further, net sales gained from balanced growth across geographies.Quarter in DetailBrown-Forman’s gross profit increased nearly 9% to $587 million, while gross margin expanded 60 basis points (bps) to 66.9%.Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased about 7% year over year to $173 million. Additionally, advertising expenses rose 11% year over year to $114 million. The rise in advertising costs can be attributed to the rise in investments for the Jack Daniels family of brands and further growth of the fast-growing bourbon and tequila brands.Despite the rise in expenses, operating income grew 11% to $304 million, with operating margin expanding 80 bps to 34.6%. On an underlying basis, operating income of the company increased 5%.Balance Sheet & Cash FlowBrown-Forman ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $287 million and long-term debt of $1,770 million.

Further, the company notes that competition intensified in the developed economies, which can hinder results.However, the company believes that it is on track to deliver high-quality, top-tier results in fiscal 2018 based on the accelerated growth rates. The company is also confident about delivering solid top-line growth in fiscal 2018 driven by the strength of its premium American whiskey portfolio. Further, the company expects earnings and cash flows to benefit in future due to the new tax reform.Consequently, the company reiterated its underlying sales and operating income forecasts for fiscal 2018, while it updated the earnings view to account for the new tax reform.Management continues to project underlying sales growth of 6-7%. In fiscal 2018, the company expects a moderate increase in SG&A expense on an underlying basis driven by compensation related expenses. Further, underlying A&P growth is anticipated to be nearly in line with sales growth.Despite the higher costs, underlying operating income is anticipated to increase 8-9%. Further, the company now estimates earnings per share of $1.43-$1.48, including 3 cents negative impact from the tax reform, 10 cents impact from expenses related to the creation of charitable foundation and 3 cents from foreign exchange benefit.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates.

50,BF.B,"Markets closed mostly lower on Thursday after Core CPI data came in above expectations, increasing the overall rate of inflation to just below the Fed’s target rate. This raised speculations regarding a possible rate hike in the near future and weighed on the markets. Meanwhile, Dow gained for the third successive session and registered its 38th record close on Thursday. The S&P 500 declined after the retail shares tanked. In a series of latest threat, North Korea threatened to raze both Japan and the United States with nuclear weapons after the U.N. issued fresh sanctions against the country.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) closed at 22,203.48, gaining 0.2%. The S&P 500 Index (INX) decreased 0.1% to close at 2,495.62. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite Index (IXIC) closed at 6,454.28, declining 0.1%. A total of 6 billion shares were traded on Thursday, higher than the last 20-session average of 5.8 billion shares. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1.09-to-1 ratio.  On the Nasdaq, decliners outnumbered advancers by a 1.20-to-1 ratio.  The CBOE VIX increased 1.3% to close at 92.09.Dow Hits Another Record, Broader Markets End LowerThe Dow gained 45.30 points on Thursday to register its 38th record close for 2017. Boeing (BA  -  Free Report) and United Technologies (UTX  -  Free Report) contributed to most of the gains for the blue-chip index, rising 1.4% and 2.6% respectively. Shares of Boeing gained after the company announced plans to expand production of its 787 Dreamliner jets to 14 units in a month by 2019. Boeing possesses a Zacks Rank#2 (Buy), whereas United Technologies possesses a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Meanwhile, the S&P 500 dropped almost 3 points to end lower after the consumer discretionary shares tanked. Of the 11 major sectors of the S&P 500, five ended in the red, with consumer discretionary shares leading the decliners. The Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLY) was down 0.54%. Such losses were incurred due to a slump in the shares of retail stocks. Shares of Tiffany & Co. (TIF  -  Free Report) and Kroger Co. (KR  -  Free Report) declined 4.8% and 2.2% respectively, weighing heavily on the S&P 500.An Uptick in Inflation Raises Expectations of a Rate Hike by FedThe Core CPI surged 0.4% for the month of August as compared to the consensus estimate of 0.3% increase for the same period. High rents and surging gas prices increased the cost of living in the United States in August. Gasoline prices surged last month as an aftermath of Hurricane Harvey and the economists do not expect the prices to go down anytime soon.Moreover, the shelter index –– an index for measuring the cost of shelter –– swelled 0.5% in August, posting its biggest monthly increase since 2005. Economists commented that such an increase was the result of surging housing costs in the United States. Moreover, the core index rose 0.2% for the same period, logging its highest increase in six months.Such high increase in the cost of living bolstered the rate of inflation to 1.9%, up from 1.7%. This resulted in speculations regarding a possible rate hike by the Fed as the figures for inflation came in just below the desired 2%. Such speculations caused broad based losses for the market.Meanwhile, the cost of medical care decreased in August. The cost of medical care gained a paltry 1.8% in the last 12 months, also marking its smallest gain since 1965. Economists believe such a low rate of growth can be owed to declining payouts to doctors. Moreover, the uncertainty about the future of Obamacare also contributed toward the retarding growth rate of medical care costs.Fresh Threats Surface from North KoreaIn the latest rhetoric, North Korea issued fresh threats to both Japan and the United States on Thursday in the wake of new sanctions by the UN on the Asian country. In a clear-cut statement, North Korea vowed to raze both Japan and United States with nuclear weapons. Geopolitical tensions between Pyongyang and Washington have escalated in the past after the Asian country tested a series of its nuclear missiles, one of them flying over Japan’s Hokkaido.Trump Agrees With the Democrats Once AgainOn Wednesday night, top leaders from the Democratic Party stated that they had reached an agreement with President Trump to protect the children of illegal immigrant in the United States. This comes in exchange of improved security at the border; however, it does not include funding for the physical wall along the U.S. - Mexico border. However, Trump tweeted on Thursday that no such deal had been reached with the Democrats.Stocks That Made HeadlinesBrown-Forman Boosts Investment in Cooperage, Cuts JobsBrown-Forman Corporation (BF.B  -  Free Report) has decided to invest $45 million in its cooperage located at MacLean Avenue in Louisville, KY, in order to manufacture high-quality barrels.

51,BF.B,"Brown-Forman Corporation (BF.B  -  Free Report) has decided to invest $45 million in its cooperage located at MacLean Avenue in Louisville, KY, in order to manufacture high-quality barrels. In addition to giving the cooperage a facelift, the investment will help in lowering operating costs and enhancing efficiency.As part of the modernization, the company plans to install new equipment that will ease the work of the Heading and Staving departments. This will attract elimination of 70 jobs after complete implementation in early 2019. Following the revamp, the facility will still hold 205 employees. The company plans to offer the affected employees transitional support.Through this investment, the company will not only retain the competitive advantage producing its own barrels but also improve the long-term viability of the Louisville plant and minimize accidents.Established in 1945, Brown-Forman’s cooperage crafts more than 2,500 barrels per day. In fact, the cooperage has been lending unique flavors to the company’s bourbon for more than 70 years now. It is used to age spirits like Jack Daniel’s, Woodford Reserve, Old Forester, Early Times, Canadian Mist, el Jimador and Herradura.Apart from having a cooperage in Louisville, Brown-Forman also has a cooperage in Decatur, AL. Here, the company crafts barrels for its premium brand, Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Whiskey.Brown-Forman’s PerformanceBrown-Forman looks appeasing backed by its sturdy portfolio, solid strategies and robust outlook for the year. This spirits maker is poised to gain from its industry growth trends as well.Going forward, the company plans to expand Jack Daniel's market share in the developed markets as well as emerging markets, where the whiskey category is in the early stages of development. Additionally, it is on track to expand the sphere of other brands, alongside entering the fastest-growing spirit category, the Irish Whiskey.Therefore, we believe Brown-Forman is well-positioned to gain from the ongoing industry trends driven by strength in its premium American whiskey and tequila brands, along with its Jack Daniel’s trademark.Consequently, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company’s shares have rallied 8.1% in the past month, outperforming the industry’s gain of 3.8%. Also, the stock boasts a Growth Score of B, which looks encouraging.Looking for More?

52,BF.B,"The Boston Beer Co. Inc. (SAM  -  Free Report) looks like a strong contender in the Alcohol Beverage space as its sturdy portfolio, robust surprise trend, strategic initiatives, and growth through acquisition hold promise. Further, the recent evolution in drinking trends makes this Boston, MA-based company’s shares a must buy.This largest craft brewer of the United States has seen its shares surge 16.6% quarter to date, outpacing the industry’s 12.1% upside. Currently, the industry is placed at the top 5% of the Zacks classified industries (14 out of 256). In fact, the company’s shares have substantially outperformed the broader Consumer Staples sector’s gain of 2.1%, which is placed at the top 38% of the Zacks classified sectors (10 out of 16). That said, let’s find out more about the factors aiding Boston Beer’s performance.Solid PortfolioBoston Beer commands a robust portfolio of globally recognized brands and is amongst the largest U.S. premium craft brewers producing beer, malt beverages, and cider products. In addition to selling alcoholic beverages in the United States, it distributes beverages in Canada, Europe, Israel, Caribbean, Pacific Rim, Mexico, and Central and South America, through a strong network of wholesale distributors. We expect the company’s continued focus on pricing, product innovation and brand development to boost operational performance and position in the market.Robust Surprise Trend & Outlook Boost EstimatesThe company reported solid second-quarter 2017, wherein both earnings and sales topped estimates and improved year over year. While this marked third straight earnings beat, sales returned to growth after three consecutive misses. Results benefited from top-line gains accompanied by gross margin improvement and lower operating costs owing to the company’s cost saving initiatives. Further, gross margins expanded in the quarter attributable to higher revenues per barrel that resulted from better pricing and package mix, along with lower brewery processing cost per barrel due to cost saving initiatives.Boston Beer Company, Inc. (The) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Boston Beer Company, Inc. (The) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Boston Beer Company, Inc. (The) QuoteMoreover, the company raised the lower-end of its previously stated guidance range. The company now estimates adjusted earnings per share in the range of $5.00-$6.20 compared with the prior guidance of $4.20-$6.20. Consequently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.57 and $5.82 for 2017 and 2018 rose 14.6% and 8.6%, respectively, in the past 60 days.Strategic Initiatives to Drive GrowthBoston Beer remains committed to a three-point growth plan focused on revival of its Samuel Adams and Angry Orchard brands, cost saving initiatives and long-term innovation. One, the company is keen on the revival of the Samuel Adams and Angry Orchard brands through packaging, innovation, promotion and brand communication initiatives. Further, it targets maintaining momentum for the Twisted Tea brand.Two, the company has accelerated focus on cost savings and efficiency projects, while ensuring that these savings are directed for further brand development. In this regard, the company has adjusted the organization to the new volume environment, while at the same time retained capability to innovate and return to growth. This is reflected in the improved gross margin and increased spending on brands in second-quarter 2017. Based on this early success, the company continues to anticipate improving gross margin by one percentage point every year through 2019.The company’s third priority is long-term innovation, wherein its focus currently hovers around maintaining the leadership of its Truly Spiked & Sparkling brand and ensuring it reaches full potential.Gaining From Industry TrendsAlbeit the prohibitions on drinking, recent observations unveil that alcohol sales trends have been witnessing a change with a higher demand for flavored products and tequilas. In fact, the industry has recently seen the spirits segment gaining traction, accounting for nearly 36% of the total alcohol market.Consequently, the Alcoholic Beverages industry has gained 22.8% year to date, compared with the S&P 500 market’s growth of 11.5%.Bottom LineThough the company continues to face hurdles due to soft depletion trends stemming from weakness in Samuel Adams, soft craft beer and cider categories, its revival efforts and robust drinking trends position it for solid long-term profitability.

61,BF.B,"Wall Street and the White House are jittery as repercussions related to fears of a trade war with China, possibilities of three or more rate hikes by the Fed this year, and tech stock concerns regarding data privacy and antitrust risks continue to do the rounds. However, the Chinese government’s retaliation to the Trump administration’s levy of 25% tariffs on 1,300 imported goods from China topped the headlines.China’s president, Xi Jinping, recently levied up to 25% tariffs on 106 U.S. imports, including soybeans, cars, chemicals and more. With this, both countries are targeting about $50 billion tariffs on imports from each other.Signs of a U.S.-China trade war further became prominent with Trump’s intention to strike another $100 billion in tariffs on Chinese goods. This has certainly sent shock waves across the entire global economy.The new tariffs framed by China's Ministry of Commerce are expected to hurt a host of U.S. industries, including consumer electronics, food, beverages, aircrafts and automobiles, among others. According to experts, the tariff is likely to be higher than anticipated, with the U.S. agricultural industry being the prime target.The tariffs will also affect meat-exporting companies, with the levy of 25% tariff on pork. Per sources, China is one of the largest markets for U.S. pork exports in terms of value and volume. Consequently, the hiked tariffs are expected to cause significant loss for China’s meat exporters and in turn, hurt their profitability.However, the effective date for the imposition of these tariffs has not been disclosed yet. While the United States stated that the tariffs will take effect after a public comment and consultation period lasting for about two months, China said that the imposition depends on Trump’s decision.Alleged intellectual property violations by Chinese companies led to a U.S. trade deficit of $504 billion with China, which sparked the trade conflict between the world’s two largest economies. To force changes in China’s intellectual properties practices, the Trump administration at first imposed a tariff of up to $60 billion on Chinese imports, particularly on steel and aluminum. In response, China retaliated by imposing tariffs worth about $3 billion on 128 American exports.Key U.S. Sectors at StakeAs is clear from the above discussion, the recently levied tariffs are likely to erode the profit margins of players in the Consumer Staples sector. This sector, which mainly comprises food, meat, beverages and agriculture stocks, is likely to be at risk after the imposition of the aforementioned tariffs.Generally, Consumer Staples stocks are considered most defensive, owing to their nature of fulfilling the basic necessities of daily lives. However, how these stocks will battle the current turmoil remains to be seen.Currently, Consumer Staples ranks among the top 50% of all Zacks sectors (8 of 16).Let’s take a closer look at some of the prominent players in Consumer Staples, highlighting their current position and ability to sail through the trade war scenario.Starting with Archer Daniels Midland Company (ADM  -  Free Report), this leading food processing company remains on track with the accomplishments related to operational excellence and readiness program. Further, management remains encouraged to deliver growth through cost-saving efforts, enhanced capabilities, product innovations and global strength. Notably, the company has corn processing facilities in China and entered a joint development agreement with the China-based Qingdao Vland Biotech Group Co., Ltd to develop new enzymes for animal feed applications.  This exposure may call for troubles for the company if the trade-war intensifies. Nevertheless, the Illinois-based company sports a Zacks Rank #1. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Tyson Foods, Inc. (TSN  -  Free Report), also a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company has been witnessing rising demand across the Beef, Chicken and prepared foods segments. Moreover, its Prepared Foods category has been delivering solid growth in particular, courtesy of rising demand for protein-packed brands and synergies from the AdvancePierre’ buyout. However, the company continues to incur higher wage and freight costs due to tightening market conditions. Also, raw materials price volatility remains a threat. Though the US-China conflict should have little impact on the company at present due to its modest exposure in China, the war may stall its chances to expand in the Chinese market.Hormel Foods Corporation (HRL  -  Free Report), the major manufacturer and marketer of various meat and food products in the United States and international markets, carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). The company believes that marketing programs and elevated demand for on-trend branded products will continue to boost its revenues in the quarters ahead. Moreover, its near-term results are anticipated to improve on the back of the recently made acquisitions. However, its Jennie-O Turkey Store segment remains soft owing to excess meat stock in cold storage and fall in turkey prices. The company has a strong business in China and operates through exports, joint venture and licensing partnerships. Further, Hormel Foods is enhancing its global footprint with higher capital investments in China, which might be at stake due to improved tariffs.Campbell Soup Company (CPB  -  Free Report) is progressing well with its cost savings plan. This is evident from the raised annualized savings target of $500 million. Also, the company remains keen on making acquisitions to enhance its brand portfolio and boost growth. The company’s recent buyout of Snyder’s-Lance is likely to aid Campbell in fortifying its snacking brands’ portfolio, thus making it a snacking leader. Moreover, the company’s Kelsen brand has been delivering solid performance in China, which might be hampered due to the proposed changes in tariffs. Nevertheless, Campbell carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Brown-Forman Corporation (BF.B  -  Free Report), the major producer and distributor of premium alcoholic beverages in the world, continues to gain from solid growth in underlying sales, persistent momentum at its focus categories and strength in Jack Daniels. This Zacks Rank #3 stock remains optimistic on growth at its premium American whiskey and tequila brands. Looking ahead, management sees higher growth potential in China as it accelerates investments in this area. However, any adverse changes to the US-China relations may stall the company’s aspirations to grow in the region.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers.
