0,ITW,"With the S&P 500 pressing on to all-time highs, is the stock market too good to be true? Are we — shudder — approaching a bubble?
"
1,ITW,"One way to gauge the risk is to look at the number of S&P 500 industries with nosebleed price-earnings ratios when the market bubble burst in March 2000. A P-E ratio of 30 or higher is often looked at as unsustainably high for most companies.
"
2,ITW,"""Many investors think the market is overly expensive because they hear about it hitting a new high,"" said Jeff Kleintop, chief market strategist for LPL Financial, the nation's fourth largest broker-dealer and largest independent broker-dealer. ""And there are some (recent) highflying names like Amazon (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Tesla Motors (TSLA). Biotech was hot too. But there just aren't that many bubbly industries.""
"
3,ITW,"As the bubble was bursting 14 years ago, 16 of the S&P 500's 62 industries had P-E ratios topping 30. That accounted for 70% of S&P 500 companies' total market value.
"
4,ITW,"Of course, the market doesn't need to be in a bubble the size of 2000's to portend a big sell-off, but the absence of a bubble reduces the risk of a market blowoff.
"
5,ITW,"Just four industries had P-Es over 30 as of March 28, 2014. They accounted for less than 4% of the benchmark's market value.
"
6,ITW,"The four hot-and-sweaty segments this time are health care technology, REITs, Internet and catalog retail, and construction materials.
"
7,ITW,"Below the 30 P-E bubble threshold, industrials are a segment whose prospects Kleintop likes.
"
8,ITW,"""Those are companies that create capital goods used by other businesses,"" he said. ""I like the segment because business spending is rising."" Many names in that space — and other nonfrothy industries — are badly beaten down due to anemic spending last year.
"
9,ITW,"General Electric (GE) is one likely beneficiary, Kleintop says. ""Transportation and railroad equipment has been in high demand,"" he said.
"
10,ITW,"Illinois Tool Works (ITW) should benefit from the manufacturing renaissance, he says. They make goods used to expand or revamp factories.
"
11,ITW,"Tech hardware is a second segment that should gain from increased capital goods spending. Business hiring in general is climbing. That should boost hardware and services revenues for IBM (IBM), Kleintop says.
"
12,ITW,"Regional banks are a third segment Kleintop likes. PNC (PNC) and Wells Fargo (WFC) stand to gain from more borrowing as the economy warms. Also, rising rates make lending more profitable. PNC has IBD's Composite Rating of 91.
"
13,ITW,"In the consumer discretionary segment, some brick-and-mortar retailers are positioned to benefit from rising consumer spending because their valuations are low and their fundamentals are promising.
"
14,ITW,"""That might benefit retailers like Macy's (M), PetSmart (PETM) and a more discount-oriented retailer like Kohl's (KSS),"" Kleintop said.With the S&P 500 pressing on to all-time highs, is the stock market too good to be true?

15,ITW,"There's nothing like a promising corporate marriage to make a big splash on Wall Street.
"
16,ITW,"That's how the scenario has played out for water products industry leader Pentair (PNR). Its stock has spurted up about 62% since the company tied the knot with Tyco International's (TYC) Tyco Flow division, in September 2012, six months after announcing plans.
"
17,ITW,"The $10 billion stock-for-stock merger created a roughly $8 billion-a-year powerhouse in flow control, filtration and equipment protection. Tyco Flow complements Pentair's offerings and gives it a strong position in fast-growing markets, including the energy arena, while giving a nice lift to revenue and profit, as well as generating cost synergies.
"
18,ITW,"The combo also gives Pentair an opportunity to apply its Pentair Integrated Management System to Tyco Flow's business with the goal of boosting efficiency, performance and productivity — in turn driving earnings growth, analysts say. The PIMS approach, as Pentair calls it, involves a studied set of methods and processes for finding new market opportunities, speeding product development and planning rollouts, while trying to stay lean and sharp as a company.
"
19,ITW,"Pentair was already a big player in the water and fluid systems arena prior to the merger, with products ranging from energy-efficient pumps and point-of-use filtration to engineered pumps and fluid processing systems. It also had a strong position in technical solutions with products that guard and protect electronics and electrical equipment such as enclosures and cases, and made heat management equipment and thermal management systems.
"
20,ITW,"Tying With Tyco
"
21,ITW,"Tyco Flow, a maker of flow control products, added to the mix a lineup including highly engineered valves and controls used in energy, general process, mining and water industries.
"
22,ITW,"""The deal was transformational,"" said Canaccord Genuity analyst John Quealy. ""It gets Pentair into the energy market where they weren't a player, and from a financial perspective it doubled the size of the company.""
"
23,ITW,"Pentair posted revenue of $4.4 billion in 2012. It estimates 2013 sales will grow to $7.4 billion.
"
24,ITW,"The rationale behind the deal was diversification, says Quealy.
"
25,ITW,"Prior to the merger, he says, Pentair was ""very strong"" in water and electrical equipment, but had ""de minimis"" exposure to energy. Meanwhile Tyco was ""very strong"" in energy-related applications, he adds, and energy was an area in which Pentair intended to participate.
"
26,ITW,"The combination gives Pentair more exposure to energy applications in industrial sectors and doubles its presence in the energy sector as a combined company, said CEO Randall Hogan on a conference call in March 2012 announcing the deal. Pentair expected the transaction to be ""highly accretive"" to earnings, adding 40 cents a share to 2013 earnings. It estimates combined company earnings will be greater than $5 a share by 2015, reflecting synergies through efforts such as streamlining operations and economies of scale.
"
27,ITW,"Since closing the deal, adds Quealy, Pentair has ""encouraged the Street"" it can hit the 2015 earnings target. Most recently, on Dec. 10, Pentair said in a statement that it ""remains committed to the target synergies from the transaction, and its $5 per share 2015 EPS goal.""
"
28,ITW,"Pentair is able to drive earnings through operating efficiencies and continuous improvement processes, says Wedbush Securities analyst David Rose.
"
29,ITW,"""It's still very early in the process, but right out of the gate it looks like the company is a little ahead of expectations in cost-saving synergies,"" he said. ""The outlook so far is encouraging.""
"
30,ITW,"Fruits Of Synergy
"
31,ITW,"Investors believe the merger was a good move for the company, he says, and consequently the stock has made a fairly large move.
"
32,ITW,"""We think there are a lot of opportunities ahead and clearly see the path to more operating efficiencies and cost reductions,"" Rose said, ""probably on the higher end of expectations.""
"
33,ITW,"Pentair now expects its ""realized synergies"" relating to the merger integration in 2013 to be about $120 million, above the $90 million previously estimated, said Hogan on the company's Oct. 22 third-quarter conference call.
"
34,ITW,"""The increase over previous estimates is being driven by sourcing and lean savings in Flow Control and is the result of building momentum around our proven PIMS operating system,"" Hogan said.
"
35,ITW,"Quealy figures Pentair is in about the ""third or fourth inning"" of the merger integration process.
"
36,ITW,"Pentair will likely shed more light on its prospects in the wake of the merger when it gives its full-year 2014 outlook on Tuesday.
"
37,ITW,"Quealy says he expects the forecast to be ""consistent with other industrials,"" and that he doesn't expect any ""major surprises.""
"
38,ITW,"Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters see 2014 earnings rising 24% to $3.96 a share.
"
39,ITW,"Meanwhile, Pentair is faring well on the financial front, with double-digit profit gains the past two quarters. Earnings rose 34% to 86 cents a share in the third quarter. Sales jumped 111% to $1.8 billion. Analysts expect full-year earnings to rise 34% to $3.20 a share.
"
40,ITW,"""The third quarter met our expectations on the bottom line, as margins expanded 210 basis points to 13.6%,"" said Hogan on the quarter's conference call. ""Price and productivity more than offset inflation, mix was positive and synergies read out better than expected. Our adjusted EPS grew 25%, even though sales declined 1% organically.""
"
41,ITW,"Regional Ups And Downs
"
42,ITW,"But sales were $50 million below Pentair's expectations, he added, due primarily to weak results in Australia. The weakness was not only related to the local economy, but also ""a significant foreign exchange head wind,"" he said.
"
43,ITW,"On a brighter note, Pentair continues to see strength in the residential end market as it benefits from an improving housing market in North America and more spending on dwellings amid rising home values.
"
44,ITW,"Pentair's huge lineup for this market ranges from treatment products that filter and purify water to energy-efficient systems that ensure water pressure is just right. Pentair is also a leading provider of pool and spa equipment.
"
45,ITW,"Sales in the residential and commercial end markets, which accounted for about 45% of the company's Water & Fluid Solutions segment revenue in the quarter, rose 12% from a year earlier.
"
46,ITW,"The food and beverage sector — also a part of the Water & Fluid Solutions segment — remained ""very strong"" in the quarter, Hogan says. Sales to that market grew 20%.
"
47,ITW,"In the Valves & Controls segment, created after the Tyco Flow merger, sales declined 1% in the quarter. They would have been up 1% if Australia were excluded, said Hogan on the call.
"
48,ITW,"Sales to the oil and gas industry were flat, he added, as many ""downstream"" customers deferred annual maintenance shutdowns due to high activity.
"
49,ITW,"Pentair is the fifth-largest company by market cap in IBD's Machinery-General Industrial industry group, after Illinois Tool Works (ITW), Parker-Hannifin (PH), Ingersoll-Rand Co. (IR) and Dover (DOV). The group currently ranks No. 20 of the 197 industry groups IBD tracks.
"
50,ITW,"On Tuesday Pentair announced that its board has authorized a share buyback program of up to $1 billion through Dec. 31, 2016. The buyback will leave Pentair with another $2 billion in cash and balance sheet capacity for additional business reinvestment or share repurchase by 2015, Hogan said in a statement.
"
51,ITW,"The same day, Pentair said that its board has approved changing the parent company's place of incorporation from Switzerland to Ireland. Shareholders are expected to vote on the proposed change at an anticipated second-quarter shareholders meeting.
"
52,ITW,"The current Swiss firm Pentair Ltd. will become a newly-formed Irish company named Pentair PLC.
"
53,ITW,"That will be the parent company of Pentair and its subsidiaries, and will have tax residency in the U.K. It will trade under the current Pentair stock symbol PNR on the NYSE.There's nothing like a promising corporate marriage to make a big splash on Wall Street.That's how the scenario has played out for water products industry leader Pentair (PNR).

58,ITW,"Apple (AAPL) and Bank Of America (BAC) top the latest list of new buys by top-performing mutual funds, but these large investors also placed big bets on stocks in the medical, semiconductor, building, chemical and machinery sectors.X Fund managers tend to take a longer-term approach, so their investments over the last three months in stocks like managed care provider Aetna (AET), chip equipment stock Applied Materials (AMAT), homebuilder Pulte Group (PHM) and industrial machinery maker Illinois Tool Works (ITW) show they expect continued growth this year in the key industries and sectors that often drive GDP and the overall economy.And despite fears that Amazon (AMZN) is primed to rule the retail world, these leading mutual funds also established new positions or added to their existing ones in Home Depot (HD) and Best Buy (BBY).Apple saw the most new buyers and the most money invested, with 65 funds picking up an estimated nearly $1.8 billion of the iPhone maker's shares.Apple has been carving out a flat base as part of a second-stage base-on-base formation. The stock closed Tuesday's session 1% below the 176.34 buy point.BofA was the only other stock on the list to get more than a $1 billion investment, as 57 funds sunk $1.04 billion into the banking giant.The Charlotte, N.C.-based company's share price has nearly doubled since Donald Trump's election in 2016, and the stock is now 19% above the 25.45 buy point it cleared last September.Many names on the list, including Best Buy, Texas Instruments (TXN) and FedEx (FDX), have already broken out and are now extended beyond their buy ranges, but Apple is not the only stock on the list in or near a potential buy zone.Graco (GGG), which provides equipment to measure, control and dispense fluid and powder materials in the manufacturing processing and construction industries, cleared a 44.80 buy point on Dec. 15 and is now trading at the upper end of the buy zone.Defense contractor Heico (HEI) also broke out in good volume on Dec. 15, but then pulled back to its 93.10 buy point, where it found support. The maker of jet engine components and electronic systems closed Tuesday's near the very top of the buy range.Pulte is up over 40% from a breakout in June, but the Atlanta-based homebuilder has been trading in a very tight range in recent weeks and may offer an add-on buying opportunity at 34.70.Applied Materials is trying to form a new base, but note that it's late-stage and the semiconductor equipment maker's relative strength line is well below new high ground. The stock continues to tests support at its 50-day line.Although Bank Of America received the aforementioned $1 billion buy-in, it also topped the list of stocks being sold with 36 net sellers (93 funds selling minus 57 buying).No. 2 on the sell side was fellow financial titan JPMorgan Chase (JPM), which had 35 net sellers (91 funds selling minus 56 buying).Defense contractors Boeing (BA), Honeywell (HON) and Northrop Grumman (NOC), as well as Aetna and Southwest Airlines (LUV), were also among the 10 stocks with the most net sellers.RELATED:2018 Stock Market Outlook: What To Watch For In The New YearLooking For The Next Nvidia?

59,ITW,"As the current bull market approaches its ninth year and signs of sector rotation and a possible top emerge, now is a good time to see who joins Apple (AAPL), Intel (INTC) and Bank of America (BAC) on IBD's latest list of new buys by top-performing mutual funds.X Over the last three months, these leading fund managers have continued to pick up shares in semiconductor-related stocks like Intel and Texas Instruments (TXN), building sector names like leading homebuilder Pulte Group (PHM) and construction products manufacturer Masco (MAS), as well as several industrial machinery companies, including Parker-Hannifin (PH) and Illinois Tool Works (ITW).With tensions around North Korea's nuclear missile program rising, it's not surprising that these funds have also been investing in defense contractors, including Aerojet Rocketdyne (AJRD) and Heico (HEI).Apple, Intel and BofA topped the list in terms of money invested. Seventy-four funds invested an estimated total of $2.3 billion in Intel, while 97 funds scooped up nearly $2 billion of Apple shares. Eighty-nine funds put $1.3 billion into Bank of America.Apple broke out on Oct. 27, but after a short rise has eased back to form a new flat base showing a possible 176.34 entry. Intel has pulled back after making a solid gain from an early October breakout. The chip giant is now testing support at its 10-week line and appears to be setting up a new base with a possible 47.40 buy point.BofA remains extended after clearing a 25.45  entry on Sept. 27. The financial titan is currently 13% above the buy point.Several stocks on this month's list are in or near a potential buy zone, but keep in mind that recent selling pressure in the major indexes and pullbacks by several leading stocks means the current uptrend could be starting to roll over into a correction. If that happens, it will be difficult for individual stocks to make a sustained upward climb.Orthopedic implant maker Stryker (SYK) is working on a first-stage base-on-base with a 160.72 entry. Look for the relative strength line to get closer to new high ground and for the stock to find support at its 50-day moving average. Stryker closed below that benchmark line on Thursday in rising volume.Heico has found support at its 10-week moving average as it tries to complete a flat base with a 93.10 entry. The pattern is part of a long, first-stage base-on-base formation.Fellow defense contractor Aerojet Rocketdyne is also working on a base, but is trading below its 10-week moving average with a lagging RS line.Regional bank stock Synovus Financial (SNV) jumped past a 47.77 entry on Nov. 28, but has now pulled back to test that buy point once again.Three stocks on the list currently pay a dividend yielding at least 2% on an annualized basis: Texas Instruments (2.5%), Intel (2.5%), New Mexico-based electricity utility PNM Resources (PNM) (2.4%) and Dover (DOV) (2%).For a look at how to generate income with stocks and mutual funds without taking on undue risk, see IBD's new special report on income investing.JPMorgan Chase (JPM) topped the list of new sells, with 94 net sellers (163 funds selling minus 69 buying). But recent chart action may be telling a different story.Like BofA and other big bank stocks, JPMorgan has gotten a bump as the likelihood of Donald Trump and Republicans passing tax reform has risen.Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) had 55 net sellers (130 selling, 75 buying), while Aetna (AET), which will merge with CVS (CVS) if the deal clears regulatory hurdles, had 35 (94 selling, 59 buying).Johnson & Johnson is working on a flat base as part of a longer first-stage, base-on-base formation. The buy point is 144.45. The stock ended Thursday's session 2% below the entry.RELATED:Find And Track The Best Mutual FundsIncome Investing: How To Find The Best Dividend Stocks

63,ITW,"When considering what names to put on your watch list, focus on stocks with an 80 or higher RS rating. 2016 IPO Fortive (FTV) just met that criteria with a new score of 81.IBD's proprietary rating tracks price performance with a 1 (worst) to 99 (best) score. The grade shows how a stock's price performance over the last 52 weeks stacks up against all the other stocks in our database. History reveals that the stocks that go on to make the biggest gains typically have an RS Rating north of 80 in the early stages of their moves.Based in Everett, WA, where Boeing (BA) has its massive airplane manufacturing building, Fortive was spun off from Danaher and went public in July 2016.The maker of industrial testing and measurement equipment is a global leader in its industry, with operations in over 40 countries and $6.2 billion in revenue in 2016.Fortive has climbed steadily higher since breaking out earlier this year and has been building a flat base with a 64.37 buy point.On Monday, the stock cleared that buy point, rising over 1%. It remains within buy zone, but look for heavier volume to kick in to show conviction for the move.The company saw both earnings and sales growth rise last quarter. Earnings-per-share increased from 1% to 13%. Revenue edged up from 3% to 4%.Fortive holds the No. 17 rank among its peers in the Machinery-General Industrial industry group.

Boeing (BA) led with a 4.2% gain and Caterpillar (CAT) was second with a 2% gain.

66,ITW,"As an income investor, can you find promising stocks for the new year by surveying what worked well in 2016? Yes, and there are several reasons why.Many of last year's strong winners have emerged from early-stage bases, so they may have further potential to rise. Also, these stocks continue to exhibit the type of steady earnings that enable future cash payouts to continue for years to come.The prospect of future hikes in the quarterly dividends among these leaders also looks promising.The biggest winners that appeared in IBD's The Income Investor column included an oil and gas pipeline play that rose 133% for the year (Oneok (OKE)), a truck maker that rolled ahead 55% (Cummins (CMI)), a paper products titan that gained 41% (International Paper (IP)), and a railroad that chugged 40% higher (CSX (CSX)).Two of these companies hailed from the transport sector, and for good reason. The Dow Jones transportation average rose nearly 21% for the year, a real sign of overall confidence in the current economy.But other top-performing income stocks hailed from a fairly wide range of industries as the stock market showed broad gains amid a choppy year.Many of the 34 companies featured in this column that rose 20% or more in 2016 saw big climbs in the third and fourth quarters, sparked in part by Donald Trump's upset win over Hillary Clinton in the Nov. 8 presidential election. The businessman's pledge to boost manufacturing, coal and infrastructure rebuilding inside America's borders helped unleash a strong rally in market sectors that had lagged earlier in the year.Banking stocks affirmed this fury of sudden buying, and perhaps some short-covering too, as a stream of positive economic data on jobs, industrial output, spending and personal income helped convince the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates in December for only the second time in 12 months.The fed funds rate rose to a target range of 0.5%-0.75%, and the prospects of three additional hikes in 2017 are currently bright.Higher interest rates — so long as they do not damage the current level of U.S. spending, building, construction and lending — bode well for the banks that rely heavily on the spread between the rates they pay for deposits and the rates they charge for loans.No wonder, then, that Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB) (annualized yield of about 2%), Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) (3.6% yield) and Toronto Dominion (TD) (3.3%) made the top of the winners list with year-to-date gains of 26% to 35% each.Other financial services firms also prospered. Consider Principal Financial Group (PFG), featured on Sept. 16. The insurance and retirement services firm began the year with a thud along with the market, falling more than 26% in less than five weeks to a year-to-date low of 33.09, but then mustered a steady rebound.By the end of the third quarter, the stock moved into positive ground on the back of a solid 6% gain in second-quarter earnings to $1.15 a share. That snapped a five-quarter streak of profit declines. In Q3, Principal affirmed that the profit turnaround wasn't a fluke as earnings jumped 8% despite a 13% drop in the top line.Some heavy machinery, diversified operations and other types of industrial firms also excelled. They included Johnson Controls (JCI), Ingersoll-Rand (IR) and Illinois Tool Works (ITW).Johnson's 2.4% yield is just mildly better than the S&P 500's 2.0% payout. However, shareholders apparently liked how the expert in electronic security systems, valves, pipes and fire-protection products improved its profitability. Pretax margin improved to 11.1% in fiscal 2016 (ended in September), rebounding sharply from 7.7% in fiscal 2015.Johnson's 3-year Earnings Stability Factor of 4 is excellent on a scale of zero (highly stable profits) to 99 (wild). IBD research has found that profit stability is a hallmark of a company's ability to pay or even increase its cash payouts to shareholders.Ingersoll-Rand and Illinois Tool also boast low three-year Earnings Stability Factor ratings of 2 and 4, respectively.Notice how on a weekly chart, all three of these industrial giants broke long-term downtrends in February, then went on to build and break out of what IBD calls bottoming base chart patterns.A rally out of these refreshed first-stage bases is bullish for income investors who hope to buy a stock that may be emerging out of a slump, pays a decent dividend and has the potential to deliver toasty capital gains.RELATED:2017 Personal Finance Action Plan & 2016 Stock Market ReviewInvesting In 2017: The Case For A Trump Era Secular Bull RunInvesting In 2017: The Presidencies Since The 1980s And Which Industry Groups Shined BrightestInvesting In 2017: The Bottoming Base, A Valuable Chart Pattern For Income Investors TooInvesting In 2017: The Bottoming Base, Part II; Why Apple Formed One In 2009Investing With Success: Learn From Gerald Loeb, A Wall Street GreatThe Income Investor: Why South Korea Fined Dividend Leader Qualcomm

67,ITW,"If you're generating steady income from a dividend stock, it doesn't matter what the company's fundamentals or technicals look like. Or does it?Many income investors may be content with a steady dividend payer even if the stock is a laggard when it comes to price performance. But stock price depreciation could erase some or all of that dividend income each quarter. To maximize your total return, it makes sense to focus on potential outperformers that offer a payout.""Without question, the most important factors income investors should look for with dividend stocks are fundamental factors,"" Robert Johnson, president and CEO of The American College of Financial Services, told IBD. ""In recent years, the price-earnings ratios on these stocks have been driven up to historically high levels ... because high-quality bonds were simply not providing the level of yields that many investors were looking for.""Click Here For A List Of Top Performing Dividend StocksSo how should one search for quality dividend stocks? IBD's daily Dividend Leaders, REIT Leaders and Utility Leaders screens offer a good starting point. The companies making the screens meet certain fundamental criteria and pay a yield in line with or higher than the S&P 500's average, which is currently 1.99%. But don't forget to conduct further due diligence.Special Report: Dividend And Income InvestingCheck out the company's earnings growth as well as sales. Is it one of the leaders in an outperforming industry group? Is there recent news that could affect the company?Study its price and volume action on a chart. Bookmark The Income Investor column and check back for an in-depth look at a different dividend stock each day.IBD's proprietary Composite Rating is a useful tool to quickly identify quality stocks. It takes a stock's key ratings — Earnings Per Share, Relative Strength, Sales + Profit Margins + Return on Equity, Accumulation/Distribution — and combines them into a single rating on a scale from 99 (best) to 1 (worst). The rating also takes into consideration price performance by measuring how far a stock is from its 52-week high. The closer it is to the high, chances are its overall rating will be higher.Be sure to keep an eye on the overall market as well as news or other factors that could affect a stock's industry group. For instance, the Federal Reserve is widely expected to raise interest rates by a quarter-point at its Dec. 13-14 monetary policy meeting.""Investors should operate under the premise that rates will rise, not only in December, but for the foreseeable future,"" Johnson said. ""I would expect financial stocks — banks and insurance companies, in particular — to benefit the most from the expected increase in rates.""In fact, bank stocks have staged a strong rally since midyear as the likelihood of higher rates increased.President-elect Trump's proposals for tax cuts and increased military and infrastructure spending could affect dividend stocks too.""If he is able to push this agenda through, it would likely lead to an increase in inflation and higher inflation rates,"" Johnson said. ""As rates increase, we will likely see a rotation out of high-dividend yielding stocks and into the bond market.""The accompanying chart shows the Dividend Leaders with the biggest year-to-date price gains through Dec. 8.Topping the list is Oneok (OKE), which has surged 134% this year to nearly 58. The Tulsa, Okla.-based natural gas gatherer has a hefty 4.3% dividend yield. And its dividend growth rate is 22%. Shareholders would have soundly beaten the market twice with this stock — in terms of stock price appreciation and a big yield. Per-share earnings fell 17% last year as oil and gas transport/pipeline stocks skidded, but analysts expect a 12% EPS gain this year and 8% in 2017. Fair warning, though: This stock has been no steady eddy and must be watched. It plunged from a peak of 71.19 in September 2014 to a low of 18.24 in December 2015.That's followed by Spectra Energy (SE), another natgas gatherer and distributor, up 72% year to date to about 41. Shares are working on a flat base with a potential buy point at 44.10. The stock is 6% off its 52-week high. The Houston-based company's payout is 4% on an annual basis. Full-year profit slipped the past two years but is projected to resume growth with a 1% increase this year and 21% the next. Spectra yields 4.0% and has a dividend growth rate of 9%.Chip designer Qualcomm (QCOM), which has seen its share price rise 37% this year to 68.33, also made the list. The San Diego-based company has paid dividends each year since 2003; its current annualized yield is 3.1% and its dividend growth rate is 22%.Qualcomm has posted double-digit earnings growth the past two quarters after four quarters of year-over-year declines. That trend is expected to continue with a 22% EPS gain in the current period and 15% in fiscal Q2.Hasbro (HAS) has advanced 29% so far this year to 86.78 as it shapes the right side of a base with a potential entry at 88.63. The Pawtucket, R.I.-based toymaker offers a 2.4% dividend yield and a dividend growth rate of 10%.It has a three-year earnings growth rate of 13% and an Earnings Stability Factor of 12 on a scale of 0 (most stable) to 99 (least stable). Analysts forecast EPS will rise 18% this year and 9% the next.A few S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats — companies that have increased their dividends each year for the past 25 consecutive years — make the list too. Illinois Tool Works (ITW) and Sysco (SYY) are two such classic income plays. They have advanced 37% and 33% this year, respectively, and pay annualized dividends of 2% and 2.4%.RELATED:Flexibility Is Needed For New Era Of Income InvestingProfits From Stock Gains And Augment A Low-Yielding Portfolio

68,ITW,"Things are breaking in favor of manager Joseph Fath and the T. Rowe Price Growth Stock Fund (PRGFX) he manages. The $44.6 billion portfolio was outperforming 98% of its large-cap growth fund rivals tracked by Morningstar Inc. over the three months, going into Thursday.That could help lift the mutual fund, which has been roughly in the middle of the pack so far this year, back to its longer-term record of outperformance, as Fath approaches his three-year anniversary at the helm in January.Over the past three years the fund's average annual gain of 9.53% has topped 85% of its peers, which averaged 7.37% yearly. The S&P 500 notched a 9.18% annual pace.The fund's recent rally stems from the market's rotation back toward the type of growth stocks that Fath favors. Earlier in the year, the market was rewarding deep cyclical stocks. ""That's not an area we play,"" Fath said.Fath prefers stocks with superior growth in earnings and cash flow, in good times or bad.The fund's long-term success has made it one of IBD's Best Mutual Funds 2016 Award winners. It outperformed the S&P 500 over the one-, three-, five- and 10-year periods ended Dec. 31. Only 9% of U.S. diversified stock funds accomplished that. And it was in the top 100 in three categories: all U.S. equity, all growth funds and all large caps.How is the fund managing this rebound? Eight of its 10 largest holdings as of Sept. 30 had IBD Composite Ratings of 83 or better. Five of its top 10 new buys also had Comp Ratings of at least 83.IBD'S TAKE: The Composite Rating, which starts at 1 and runs to 99, combines IBD's five performance ratings. Stocks poised to move higher often have a Comp Rating of 95 or higher, which means that they've outperformed 95% of all other stocks in terms of their Composite Rating. Here's where to learn more about reading the Comp Rating road signs.MasterCard (MA) is one the fund's top holdings. It has trended higher since early July, and it did well on Wednesday, the first day after Donald Trump's election victory. But it pulled back on Thursday, finishing 4% below its all-time high.Illinois Tool Works (ITW) is among the fund's top buys. The stock has rallied this month, adding 8% this week. Many investors look at it as a way to benefit from investments in U.S. infrastructure under a Trump administration. Fath instead is focused on the stock's ongoing fundamentals, not its potential macroeconomic drivers.""It's more of a mergers-and-acquisitions story within industrials,"" he said. ""And it is a disciplined, well-run company with seven business units. They're all doing well, all pushing margin structure over 20%. Only the welding unit is under pressure.""Fath added that the company management has executed ""good deployment of capital. They've gotten rid of bad stuff, focused on their best stuff and made good deals in recent years.""Another of his holdings, Martin Marietta (MLM), is more of a Trump infrastructure play, he says. The stock, which has an IBD Composite Rating of 94, gapped up 12% on Wednesday on massive volume and was up again Thursday. That puts Martin Marietta shares above the level at which you'd want to buy them under CAN SLIM rules.IBD'S TAKE: CAN SLIM rules establish buy ranges above buy points to keep investors from ""chasing"" stocks beyond low-risk buy zones. Leading stocks executing powerful gap-up breakouts operate according to a slightly different set of rules.The company produces crushed stone, and an other aggregates for construction.Earnings per share grew 886%, 56% and 22% the past three quarters.The company stands to benefit from programs like the Free and Secure Trade (FAST) program, which is a commercial clearance program for known low-risk shipments entering the United States from Canada and Mexico. ""(Those programs) have been slow to roll out but are ramping up now,"" he said.Also, Fath sees the company's low single-digit volume and high single-digit pricing as set to recover into high single-digit growth as the heavy rain and flooding in the Southeast that hurt them earlier this year have passed.Many investors expect certain financial stocks to benefit from a lighter regulatory burden during a Trump regime as well as from a rising-rate environment. Morgan Stanley (MS) gapped up 7% on Wednesday and was up again Thursday.Trading around 38, that left the big financial firm's shares extended above their 32.47 buy point.""(A bullish outlook for a) lot of financials is predicated on a rising-rate environment,"" Fath said. ""We think Morgan Stanley is a good company-specific story.""Fath likes Morgan Stanley's heightened focus on wealth management.And the company's bank is becoming a bigger source of income and profit as the firm does more lending.Ferrari (RACE) is another holding that Fath likes. The Italy-based sports- and luxury-car maker was spun off from Fiat just over a year ago.""This stock does not get a lot of attention,"" Fath said. ""European car analysts follow it. But it is really a luxury goods company. It does not have a lot of capital requirements and it does have a lot of demand backlog.""The company enjoys production growth of roughly 4% a year, Fath says. And it has annual pricing power of about 3% to 5%.""This is a company that can grow in the midteens for the rest of the decade,"" Fath said. ""Other luxury goods makers like Hermes trade at much higher multiples. In today's market, we like a company that can be defensive as well as offensive.""Generally, superwealthy consumers don't downshift their car buying even during a time of slow or uncertain economic growth, Fath says.RELATED:Franklin's DynaTech Wins With Stocks Of InnovatorsWhat Fidelity Trend Fund Likes About Apple, Amazon and Alphabet

Revenue edged up fractionally to $2.894 billion. Analysts expected $2.889 billion.Sales in Ingersoll-Rand's flagship climate-control segment rose 3% to $2.21 billion from $2.16 billion and adjusted operating profit for that business surged 9.8%. The company raised its full-year 2016 EPS guidance from continuing operations to $3.95 to $4.10, up from $3.80 to $4 earlier, and well above Wall Street's $3.92 target.The Ireland-based maker of climate control systems sold its remaining equity interest in Hussmann Parent on April 1 as part of a transaction in which Panasonic bought 100% of Hussmann’s shares. Ingersoll-Rand received net proceeds of about $415 million. Its 2016 guidance excludes proceeds from that sale.After its rise Tuesday, Ingersoll-Rand stock was well above both its 10-week and 200-day averages but still within trading range.

74,ITW,"Aberdeen U.S. Small Cap Equity Fund (GSXAX) is on a roll. Through March 31, the now-$558 million portfolio was the eighth-best performing U.S. diversified stock fund in the prior 12 months with a 7.58% return, according to Morningstar Inc. And it was No. 1 among small-cap funds. The S&P 500 advanced a more modest 1.35% in that period.At the quarter's end, the fund ranked in the top 1% and 2% of its small-cap growth peers over the past three and five years, respectively.The fund captures an A+ 36-month Performance Rating from IBD, which means that its performance is among the top 5% of all mutual funds in that time.Thirty-two-year-old Ralph Bassett and 47-year-old Jason Kotik, two of the fund's four managers, spoke with IBD from their offices in Philadelphia about how they invest.IBD: Describe key aspects of your research process.Kotik: We have concentrated positions of between 40 and 60 names. We start with meeting a company's management team. Some investors look at screens. We look at a company to understand its business model, to look at its historical margins and returns, the balance sheet, things like that. We build a list of questions for that management team.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Six-Month LeadersThe bigger difference (between us and other funds) is that, while we interview company management like other investors do, we take a three-to-five-year or longer approach to understanding businesses because we'll hold them a long time.Our turnover is 25% to 35% a year, the lower end of the range for most funds. Our approach is really about understanding management's discipline around their capital investments, understanding them and building a relationship with them.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Category PerformanceSo, in the future when things don't go as planned -- and there's always a time when things don't go as planned, always -- we know how they will react, based on their answers to our questions.That's really the most important part of understanding a business.IBD: You recently wrote that volatility can be an opportunity. Was the recent market volatility a buying opportunity?Bassett: In the back half of last year and the first month of this year, I would say there was more opportunity than we'd seen in a long time.We did find some companies of higher quality but linked to less predominant macro themes (than the ones that hurt the energy sector). Things unfairly got discounted around macro contagion and dollar strength. We take a long view and assume dollar strength will subside over time. So we found some good opportunities.IBD: What are some examples?Kotik: We found opportunities to take advantage of names we own. One example in Q4, we were able to top up Canadian Western Bank. When you think of western Canada, you think of oil and gas, the oil sands market. So you'd think their loans portfolio would be filled with damaged goods. But less than 3% of their loans are to oil companies. They had traded down to tangible book and to book value. We took advantage of the marketplace selling off energy stocks and Canadian stocks and anything related to the Canadian dollar, and we added to our position.IBD: What example would you provide, Ralph?Bassett: We initiated a position in WisdomTree Investments (WETF) in February at the depths of the market. Their business is focused on ETFs and specifically those that are bespoke in nature -- bespoke in the sense that they are the only solely-ETF-focused company that is public. They also have been very innovative and quick to market with products compared to their peers. Now they have a wide product menu, and that can capture shifts in client asset allocation over time.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Quarterly LeadersWe had grappled with their valuation for a while. Frankly, we watched it tumbled from 30 to 24 to roughly 10 -- then it got more intriguing. A lot of concerns about their product concentration and competitive forces were, in our minds, diminished.Secondly, they had net cash on their balance sheet and intended to keep it that way, so we weren't worried about financial risk.We will be slow and patient. This is an example of our process patience.IBD: What else besides the housing rebound is driving Gibraltar Industries (ROCK)?Kotik: It sold off in the down market, and we added to it. It's rebounded more than 40% off its bottom.Gibraltar has started to make a strong transition in its business model to diversify its end markets.Its new CEO (Frank Heard) came from Illinois Tools Works (ITW) and brought ITW's tenets of focusing on the parts of the business that provide higher profits.It's a building products company. It sells things like mailboxes to Home Depot (HD) and Lowe's Cos. (LOW). They have a large contract with the postal service for large-scale postal boxes. Apartment buildings need them because of ecommerce and the way consumers now buy products. Apartment managers can't figure out where to put all of this mail and packages. So Gibraltar came up with a plan for a new model.We own it because they use their capital extremely efficiently, and their cash flow is expanding. They're moving to a higher-margin mix of businesses.We look for company-specific drivers. Gibraltar benefits from the housing rebound. But we won't invest in companies that benefit just from volume and cyclical rebounds. We need a specific driver. For Gibraltar, it was about their transition to a more diversified business, driving higher quality profitability, rather than a focus on top-line growth.IBD: OK, what's the driver for Drew Industries (DW), a maker of components for recreational vehicles and manufactured homes?Kotik: The interest is that they've been adding dollar content on products to the RV and manufactured home industries. They've consistently improved their content dollars per vehicle.
"
75,ITW,"Their continued market share gains let them perform well even during tough times. But we're skeptical when everything is going right. We still hold it at an average weight, and we brought it down to capture profits.IBD: You own some stocks that sound like they're in non-sexy businesses. What's their appeal? What's the special catalyst? Start with RBC Bearings (ROLL), please.Bassett: They make highly specialized ball bearings, which range from pen-cap size to several feet. Those big ones go into huge industrial products and reactors.They focus on specialty areas where the ball bearings need to be designed into the product. That reduces competition, so they capture margin along the way. Their business is high-value-added, taking share in programs. They've thought about acquisitions but are being careful. Years down the road, there could be pressure on their aerospace business. We're mindful of the potential cyclicality.IBD: What about Cal-Maine Foods (CALM), an egg distributor?Bassett: They are slowly shifting away from the egg commodity part of their business. About one-quarter of their business is providing specialties like liquid eggs to McDonald's (MCD) and Dunkin' Donuts (DNKN).They're increasing their organic eggs business. And a lot of customers want cage-free eggs. Few companies can afford to provide that. It takes capital for land and structures for organic eggs and cage-free eggs.So Cal-Maine not only picks up business, it consolidates as smaller farmers are forced out.IBD: What's the special driver for MarketAxess Holdings (MKTX), an electronic bond-trading exchange?Bassett: Previously, a lot trades went through large investment banks with huge inventory. But MarketAxess can do it cheaper in smaller quantities, so if someone wants to sell several bonds rather than huge round lots, MarketAxess offers cheaper transaction costs than larger brokerages.And they focus on a relative niche market: corporate credit, which is not as huge a market as the Treasury market that large investment banks focus on.But Bloomberg has also tapped into this market, and it's hard for MarketAxess to gain share vs. Bloomberg.IBD: What's the catalyst for Prestige Brands (PBH), which markets health care and house-cleaning products?Bassett: By and large, you've heard of their products: Comet, Luden's cough drops, Monistat. When they acquire a brand, they invest in it so they can maintain or gain share, then they harvest the added cash flow.They don't manufacture. They do more branding, marketing, distribution. They are outsource manufacturers.Look at Procter & Gamble (PG), which is shrinking its portfolio of products and is refocusing. Maybe Prestige can take advantage.IBD: How important are competitive moats for companies?Kotik: Over the long term, in this marketplace, success is not about high momentum. People care about valuation, and they should. This will differentiate us.

76,ITW,"IBD's Big Cap 20 can thank the defensive names for its current outperformance among IBD's screens. While they still hold significant sway, more growth names are making an appearance.

77,ITW,"Managers of the best-performing mutual funds the past three months have been nibbling recently on top-rated stocks, which have recovered some of January's steep losses.Major indexes rallied sharply in the second half of the Valentine's month as investors bottom-fed on leading stocks at lower prices. The S&P 500 trimmed its loss to just 0.4% in February, while the Nasdaq was off 1.2%.Leading stock mutual funds have shown interests in defensive sectors like food processors, financial stocks, and in utility firms in recent months.In a slowing economy, investors often flock to food companies such as Hormel (HRL), Cal-Maine (CALM) and Tyson (TSN). Both Hormel and Tyson have performed well in the past year, hitting new highs along the way.Click Here To See A List Of New Buys Of Top Mutual Funds Among financial issues, top funds are seeking steady gains in REITs, such as Agree Realty (ADC), Equity Lifestyle Properties (ELS), Kimco Realty (KIM), Federal Realty Trust (FRT) and Sun Communities (SUI).Credit card payment processor and Leaderboard stock, PayPal (PYPL), was also added by leading funds in their latest reporting periods.Another area worth a gander is utilities, including ITC Holdings (ITC), CMS Energy (CMS), and Pinnacle West Capital (PNW).Telecom giant Verizon Communication (VZ) found its way onto top-performing funds' buy list. Fifteen leading funds added Verizon, investing an estimated $108.7 million in their latest reporting periods.The New York-based firm got a big marketing boost when J.D. Power ranked Verizon Wireless highest in network quality across six regions among U.S. wireless providers.IBD spotted four best-performing funds tapping into PayPal, investing an estimated $5.6 million. The $41.5 billion T. Rowe Price Growth Stock Fund (PRFGX) added shares in its latest reporting period.The mobile and online payment processor was spun off from long-time parent, eBay (EBAY), in July last year. It also owns the popular mobile payment app, Venmo.Now that PayPal is standing on its own two feet, the San Jose, Calif.-based firm stands to grow its mobile payment segment, particularly the in-store mobile wallet, competing with Alphabet/Google Android Pay, Apple Pay and Samsung Pay.At the Mobile World Congress, PayPal announced partnerships with Vodafone (VOD) and America Movil (AMX) subsidiaries Telco and Claro in Latin America. This means that in Europe, Mexico and Brazil, phones will have the PayPal-powered mobile wallet already installed in them. Through these partnerships, PayPal can offer merchants and consumers more flexibility and choices in how they want to pay and get paid. Because PayPal doesn't own its operating platforms and is not connected to any devices, it has a broad scope for growth.PayPal doesn't have a long trading history, but the stock has been setting up a good-looking shallow base since its July 20 IPO. It's creeping near its 42.65 buy point. PayPal's Q4 earnings grew 24% to 36 cents a share, ex items. Revenue growth rose 17% to $2.6 billion.The country's top-rated funds have been unloading medical stocks, such as Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Henry Schein (HSIC) and Quest Diagnostics (DGX), in their latest reporting periods. Large caps Illinois Tool Works (ITW) and 3M (MMM) have also been sold by leading funds.There were seven top funds selling computer-graphics chip maker Nvidia (NVDA), while only 1 fund bought, leaving six net-selling funds.

108,ITW,"A. O. Smith Corporation (AOS  -  Free Report) reported fourth-quarter 2017 earnings per share of 60 cents, ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 56 cents, thereby continuing its earnings beat streak of 24 straight quarters, which the company broke just once as it reported in-line earnings last quarter.The earnings figure improved 27.7% from the year-ago tally of 47 cents. The bottom-line improvement mainly came on the back of robust sales growth.For 2017, the company generated adjusted net earnings of $378.3 million or $2.17 per share, up 16% from the prior-year figure.Inside the HeadlinesNet sales in the quarter were up an impressive 10.1% year over year to $768.6 million. The figure also topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $767.1 million by a whisker. A thriving water heater industry in the United States, strong demand for Lochinvar branded boilers, and robust consumer product demand in China fueled the top-line growth.For the full year, the company posted record sales of $3 billion, up almost 12% from the 2016 tally.Coming back to the fourth quarter, A.O. Smith’s sales in the North America segment (comprising U.S. and Canadian water heaters and boilers) grew 6% year over year to $460.8 million. Higher volumes of commercial water heaters, strong sales of boilers, and pricing actions related to elevated steel costs proved conducive to the sales performance of this region. Water treatment products contributed about $9 million to revenues, thus supplementing the segment’s growth.Segmental operating earnings rose an impressive 17% year over year to $104.9 million. The segment’s profit was favorably influenced by higher sales of commercial water heaters and boilers and pricing actions. However, the benefit was partially offset by flared up steel costs. Consequently, operating margin expanded 230 basis points (bps) to 22.8% on a year-over-year basis.Smith (A.O.) Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Smith (A.O.) Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Smith (A.O.) Corporation QuoteQuarterly sales at the Rest of the World segment (including China, India and Europe) were up 17% year over year to $313.8 million. The improvement came largely on the back of consistent solid customer demand for A.O. Smith’s premium water-heating and water-treatment products, particularly in India (up 40%). Also, favorable pricing actions added to the top line.Operating earnings at the segment climbed a whopping 33% year over year to $50.8 million in the quarter. The favorable impact of excellent sales in India and China, along with favorable pricing actions, was partially offset by escalating steel and installation cost. Operating margin advanced 200 bps to 16.2% year over year.Share RepurchasesDuring 2017, A.O. Smith repurchased around 2.5 million common shares for $139.1 million. At the end of the year, the company has approximately 2.4 million shares remaining under the existing discretionary repurchase authority.Liquidity & Cash FlowExiting the year on Dec 31, 2017, A.O. Smith’s cash and cash equivalents totaled $346.6 million compared with $330.4 million a year back. Cash generated from operations during the year came in at $326.4 million, lower than $446.6 million recorded last year, as higher earnings were more than offset by higher outlays for working capital.At the end of the reported quarter, long-term debt was $402.9 million compared with $316.4 million witnessed at the end of Dec 31, 2016.Also, earlier this month, A.O. Smith announced a 29% hike in its quarterly cash dividend. The new dividend of 18 cents per share will be paid on Feb 15 to shareholders on record as of Jan 31.This translates to a dividend of 72 cents per share on an annualized basis, and marks the 13th consecutive year in which the company has increased its quarterly cash dividend.GuidanceConcurrent with the fourth-quarter results, the company released optimistic guidance for 2018, and expects adjusted earnings to lie in the range of $2.50-2.58 per share. The mid-point of the range reflects impressive year-over-year growth of 17%. The buoyant guidance reflects the company’s robust growth momentum, backed by solid demand.Our TakeA.O. Smith wrapped up 2017 with solid momentum, with double-digit sales growth driven by continued strong demand for its consumer products in China, and positive end markets for the company’s water heaters and boilers in North America. A.O. Smith’s continued sales and earnings growth over the past several quarters highlight the company’s underlying strength.We believe stellar prospects in China and the U.S. end markets will continue to accelerate growth in the near future. Also, dominant foothold in the North American water-heater market, along with thriving prospects in the residential and commercial boiler markets, is likely to stoke growth.However, over the past few quarters, this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company’s SG&A expenses in China (including elevated steel costs and higher fees paid to installers) have been quite high, which is creating pressure on the company’s operating margins. Furthermore, transition of the Chinese economy to a consumer-driven one might impact A.O. Smith’s sales in the region.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the same space include Illinois Tool Works Inc.

112,ITW,"In the October-December quarter, the major U.S. stock indexes performed well. While the S&P 500 returned 6.1%, Nasdaq Composite recorded 6.3% growth and NYSE Composite rallied 4.9%. Many industries benefited from healthy operating conditions in the country as well as from the strengthening global economy.Here we will talk about the machinery industry, broadly grouped under Industrial Products  — one of the 16 Zacks sectors. The sector yielded roughly 8.9% return in the quarter, outperforming the S&P 500. It is currently at the top 38%, holding the sixth position among all other sectors.We believe that domestic requirements and export orders play a key role in determining the demand for industrial machineries in any country. Also, efforts to improve trade relations across nations will be a boon for machinery companies. The U.S. machinery companies will gain from the implementation of $1 trillion investment plan for infrastructure improvement, strengthening housing and new job additions.Below we briefly discuss the broader sector’s earnings trend in the October-December quarter.Per the latest Earnings Preview dated Jan 19, 2018, the S&P 500 companies in the sector are anticipated to record year-over-year earnings growth of 22.7% in the quarter compared with 19.6% in the previous quarter. Revenues are likely to increase 11.9% versus 4.8% registered in the previous quarter.Collectively, the S&P 500 companies are predicted to record earnings and sales growth of 10.3% and 7.1%, respectively.

113,ITW,"If you’re looking for a profitable portfolio of stocks that will offer the best of value and growth investing, try the growth at a reasonable price or GARP strategy. It helps an investor gain exposure to stocks that are undervalued and have impressive growth prospects. Unlike a blend strategy, a portfolio that uses GARP investing is expected to include stocks that offer the best of both value and growth investing.GARP Metrics – Mix of Growth & Value MetricsThe GARP approach helps to zero in on stocks that are priced below the market or any reasonable target determined by fundamental analysis. These stocks also have solid prospects in terms of cash flow, revenues, earnings per share (EPS) and so on.Growth MetricsStrong earnings growth history and impressive earnings prospects are the main aspects that GARP investors borrow from the growth investing strategy. However, instead of super-normal growth rates, pursuing stocks with a more stable and reasonable growth rate is also a tactic of GARP investors. Hence, growth rates between 10% and 20% are considered ideal under the GARP strategy.Another growth metric that is considered by both growth and GARP investors is return on equity (ROE). GARP investors look for strong and higher ROE compared to the industry average to identify superior stocks. Moreover, stocks with positive cash flow find precedence under the GARP plan.Value MetricsGARP investing gives priority to one of the popular value metrics – price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. Though this investing style picks stocks with higher P/E ratios compared to value investors, it avoids companies with extremely high P/E ratios. Moreover, the price-to-book value (P/B) ratio is another value metric that is considered.Using the GARP principle, we have run a screen to identify stocks that should offer solid returns in the near term.Screening ParametersAlong with the criteria discussed in the above section, we have considered a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).Last 5-year EPS & projected 3–5 year EPS growth rates between 10% and 20% (Strong EPS growth history and prospects ensure improving business.)ROE (over the past 12 months) greater than the industry average (Higher ROE compared to the industry average indicates superior stocks.)P/E and P/B ratios less than M-industry average (P/E and P/B ratios less than that of the industry indicates that the stocks are undervalued.)These few criteria have narrowed down the universe of over 7,700 stocks to only 11.Here are seven of the 11 stocks that made it through the screen:Tempur Sealy International, Inc.

114,ITW,"A. O. Smith Corporation (AOS  -  Free Report) announced a whopping 29% hike in its quarterly cash dividend. The new dividend of 18 cents per share will be paid on Feb 15 to shareholders on record as of Jan 31.This translates to a dividend of 72 cents per share on an annualized basis. Based on the current 145.8 million shares outstanding, the new dividend will translate to a total payout of approximately $105 million.This marks the 13th consecutive year in which the company has increased its quarterly cash dividend, which underlines the strength and resilience of A.O. Smith’s balance sheet and cash generation. The dividend hike is consistent with the five-year compound annual growth rate of the company’s dividend, which exceeds 25%.Based on the closing price of $67.04 as of Jan 19, the increased dividend translates to a yield of 1.1%.With long-term value creation in mind, the company has taken consistent steps to enhance its balance-sheet strength. With a solid capital and liquidity position, the company is anticipated to continue enhancing shareholder value through efficient capital-deployment activities.Also, A.O. Smith displays strong financial leverage. Its debt/equity ratio of 0.27 compares favorably with the industry average of 0.29, indicating a lower debt burden relative to the industry. The company’s ROE of 22.4% is also much higher than the industry average of 9.7%. This reflects that it is more efficient in utilizing shareholder funds compared to its peers. Moreover, A.O. Smith has appreciated 39.8% in the last year against the 22.4% gain for its industry.Encouragingly, the company has a robust earnings surprise history, having posted an average surprise of 2.6% in the trailing four quarters, beating estimates thrice. A thriving water heater industry in the United States, as well as solid consumer product demand in China has been driving the top-line growth of the company over the past few quarters.However, there are some risks associated with investing in the stock. A.O. Smith operates in a highly competitive market and competes with renowned global brands. Over the past few quarters, A.O. Smith’s SG&A expenses in China (including elevated steel costs and higher fees paid to installers) have been quite high, adding to the company’s overall operating expenses. Higher selling costs to support expansion in Tier 2 and 3 cities, and e-commerce platform in China, along with developmental costs associated with new products, including expansion of the air purification product portfolio, are escalating the company’s operating expenses in China.Furthermore, transition of the Chinese economy to a consumer driven one has resulted in a significant slowdown that might impact A.O. Smith’s sales in the region. For 2017, A.O. Smith projects to incur a $20-million sales headwind, due to the anticipated depreciation of the Chinese currency. Consequently, we expect margins for the company's rest of the world division — which includes China — to remain weak.A.O.

118,ITW,"In this week’s video I discuss both Illinois Tool Works (ITW  -  Free Report) and McDonalds (MCD  -  Free Report).   When I am looking to recommend any growth and income stock I first identify companies that have a high Zacks Rank, a solid dividend and good long-term growth expectations.  And both ITW and MCD meet all of these criteria and more.  About the companyIllinois Tool Works Inc. (ITW  -  Free Report), a Zacks Rank # 2 (Buy) manufactures and markets a variety of products that are used worldwide.  The company’s products are found in cars, wind turbines, deep-sea rigs, healthcare, aerospace technology, food equipment, mobile devices, and many other items that you use on a daily basis.  ITW is a well-diversified company who has been a world leader in innovation for decades.  The company generates just over 50% of their revenues in the United States, and has operations around the world. Drivers behind the purchaseIllinois Tool Works Inc. (ITW  -  Free Report) who currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) announced earnings on Monday where they easily beat both the Zacks consensus earnings and revenue estimates.  Moreover, management increased their FY 2017 EPS outlook by $0.25 (+16% year over year growth), and raised their 2017 revenue guidance by $100 million to $14.3 billion (+5.2% year over year growth).  Overall, the company saw increasing revenues, improving margins, organic growth, and EPS expansion during their most recent quarterly report.   Further, the overall outlook for global growth is improving faster than previously expected.  This was reinforced when International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) increased growth expectations for both 2017 and 2018 (2017 was lifted by 0.1% to +3.6%, and 2018 was revised by +0.1% to +3.7%).  This improved global economic outlook is very beneficial to ITW as it sells industrial products and equipment in 57 different countries.Earnings History and Improving EstimatesThe company has beaten the Zacks consensus earnings and revenue estimates in 7 out of the last 8 quarters.   Further, due to the strong quarterly performance and increased EPS guidance, analysts have positively revised their estimates for both 2017 and 2018. Price and Earnings Consensus ChartThis is a great example of the kind of chart I want to see when adding a position to the service.  Solid price appreciation, and consistent growth in year over year earnings estimates.Illinois Tool Works Inc. Price and Consensus Illinois Tool Works Inc. Price and Consensus | Illinois Tool Works Inc. QuoteThis is a stable, high quality company that has consistently beaten both earnings and revenue estimates that pays a nice +2.01% dividend yield.  Further, ITW is considered a dividend aristocrat (a company that has increased their annual dividend for at least 25 consecutive years), so we should expect to see a bump in the dividend over the next 12 months as well. McDonald’s (MCD  -  Free Report) holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and over the past several quarters their international reach has been a strong tailwind for the company which has driven sales above expectations in four of the last five quarters.  The new meal options and innovation have been a large part of their sustained success, and people across the globe are visiting the famous chain more and more.  This was reflected in their recent same store sales (SSS) data, High-Growth Markets (China) +6.2%, Foundation Markets (Japan) +10.2%,  International Lead Markets (Europe, Canada) +5.7% and even at home as SSS were up +4.1%. Another attractive part of the McDonald’s story is managements Velocity Growth Plan, which is focused on “long-term profitable growth.”  Part of this strategy was to refranchise over 4,000 restaurants in China and Hong Kong, and management accomplished this goal in Q3, a year ahead of schedule.  Also, part of the growth plan is the adaptation of both mobile ordering and paying along with delivery.  While the investments in these new technologies will be a slight headwind in the near term, these new innovations are expected to benefit sales in the long term.  And as we are looking to hold this company for at least a year, this is an overall positive for the portfolio. Because of the positive earnings report, impressive same store sales, and management’s long term growth plans, analysts have raised both 2017 and 2018 EPS guidance once again.  This is reflected in the Price and Earnings Consensus graph below.  And as I mentioned before, I really like carts that show solid price appreciation along with year over year EPS guidance increases.McDonald's Corporation Price and Consensus McDonald's Corporation Price and Consensus | McDonald's Corporation QuoteMcDonalds also has a solid annual dividend of $4.04 with a yield of +2.47%, and is a dividend aristocrat (has increased their dividend payments each year for the past 25 years or more).  So we are adding a company that has solid growth prospects with an increasing dividend.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

126,ITW,"Industrial products and equipment manufacturer, Illinois Tool Works Inc. (ITW  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 23, before the market opens.The company delivered better-than-expected results in the last four quarters, pulling off an average positive earnings surprise of 2.55%. Notably, in the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings of $1.66 per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.63 by 1.84%.Since the second-quarter 2017 results release on Jul 24, the company’s shares have yielded 7.8% return, marginally outperforming 7.1% gain of the industry it belongs to. Also, during the same time period, the company outperformed the S&P 500’s gain of 2.4%.Let us see how things are shaping up for Illinois Tool Works this quarter. Factors to Affect Q3 ResultsWe believe that industrial machinery is among the many industries that have rallied on the back of the Trump government’s proposed infrastructure investment of $1 trillion. If implemented, the promised plan will boost the need for industrial products and hence benefit companies like Illinois Tool Works. Other tailwinds are the strengthening housing and commercial construction markets. Also, rise of 2 percentage points in Purchasing Managers’ Index or manufacturing index in September is a positive indicator for the industry.Illinois Tool Works has worked diligently to expand its business platform over time. Notably, the company’s Automotive OEM business has benefited from the acquisition of the Engineered Fasteners and Components business since July 2016. However, expectation of weakness in the domestic auto builds is likely to adversely impact sales of the company’s Automotive OEM segment in the second half of 2017.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Automotive OEM segment’s revenues stands at $764 million for the third quarter, below $828 million and $820 million reported in the first and second quarters, respectively.Prospects seem bright for the Construction Products segment, with sales anticipated to total $441 million in the third quarter. This projection is above $395 million reported in the first quarter and $425 million in the second quarter.Overall, Illinois Tool Works anticipates its organic revenue growth to come in within 1-3%, versus 2.6% reported in the second quarter. Also, its long-term Enterprise Strategy will aid in margin expansion. However, unfavorable impact of price/costs might erode 20-40 basis points from margin percentage in 2017.   Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Illinois Tool Works will be able to pull a surprise this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for an earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.That is not the case here for as you will see below. Zacks ESP: Illinois Tool Works has an Earnings ESP of -0.17%.Illinois Tool Works Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Illinois Tool Works Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Illinois Tool Works Inc. QuoteZacks Rank: Illinois Tool Works’ Zacks Rank #2 increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise.Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revisions momentum. Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies in the machinery industry you may want to consider, as they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter, according to our model.Barnes Group, Inc.

129,ITW,"We issued an updated research report on industrial tool maker, Illinois Tool Works Inc. (ITW  -  Free Report) on Oct 3. We believe that diversified business structure, strategic initiatives to improve margins and inorganic activities makes this stock an attractive investment choice for investors seeking exposure in the machinery industry.It currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). The company’s earnings are projected to grow 9% in the next three to five years.  Also, market sentiments have been positive for Illinois Tool Works over time. Notably, the stock has yielded 22.6% return year to date, marginally outperforming 22.2% gain recorded by the industry it belongs to.Below we discuss why investors should consider buying Illinois Tool Works’ stock.Diversification Business Structure: Illinois Tool Works is poised to gain from its vast customer base in the automotive original equipment manufacturer, automotive aftermarket, general industrial, commercial food equipment, construction and other end markets. Also, its highly engineered fasteners and components, equipment and consumable systems, and specialty products and equipments give it a competitive edge.Furthermore, international diversity has played a major role in Illinois Tool Works’ profitability over time. The company has operations in over 57 countries. Notably, it derived nearly 45% of net revenues from its operations in the United States in 2016 while the rest were secured from Canada/Mexico; Europe, Middle East and Africa; Asia Pacific and South America.Strategic Initiatives: We believe that Illinois Tool Works’ long-term Enterprise Strategy has enabled it to ensure maximum profitability through the development of new, improved products and reasonable cost control. These strategies include Business Structure Simplification, Portfolio Management and Strategic Sourcing. For 2017, enterprise initiatives are likely to contribute 100 basis points (bps) to operating margin growth. Also, the company has benefitted from application of its 80/20 business process (to focus more on 20% of the items which account for 80% of the value and less on 80% of the items which account for 20% of the value).Over time, acquired assets have strengthened the company’s core segments while creating new business opportunities in unexplored markets. Noteworthy is the company’s acquired Engineered Fasteners and Components business of ZF TRW in 2016. This buyout has expanded its product offerings under the Automotive OEM segment, contributing 6.5% to revenue growth in the second quarter.Shareholders’ Return: Share buybacks and dividend payments are the prime means of returning value to shareholders for Illinois Tool Works. In August 2017, the company hiked its quarterly dividend by 20%. Over the long term, it anticipates spending nearly 30-35% on dividend payments and 40-45% on external investments including share buybacks and acquisitions.Promising 2017 Guidance & Long-Term Targets: For 2017, Illinois Tool Works increased its earnings guidance to $6.32-$6.52 per share from the earlier projection of $6.20-$6.40. Total revenues are anticipated to be within $14.1-$14.2 billion, up from $13.9-$14.1 billion expected earlier. Organic revenue growth is expected to be 2-4% while operating margin is expected to be 24%.By the end of 2018 and beyond, the company expects organic revenue growth to be 200 bps above market, an approximate operating margin of 25% (previous expectation was 23%), and return on invested capital of above 20%. Beyond 2018, shareholders’ returns are expected within 12-14% (including operating income growth of 9-10%, 1-2% earnings accretion from share repurchases and 2% dividend yield). Organic revenue growth rate is projected to be roughly 5%.Other Stocks to ConsiderIllinois Tool Works currently carries a market capitalization of $51.7 billion. We believe that the above-mentioned positives clearly justify the stock’s current ranking.In the machinery space, some other stocks worth considering are Sun Hydraulics Corporation (SNHY  -  Free Report), Colfax Corporation (CFX  -  Free Report) and Barnes Group, Inc. (B  -  Free Report). While Sun Hydraulics sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), both Colfax and Barnes Group carry a Zacks Rank #2.

130,ITW,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Illinois Tool Works Inc. (ITW  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 7.4% in that time frame, underperforming the market.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a breakout?

Earnings were also boosted by its enterprise initiatives.Revenues in the quarter totaled $3.599 billion, slightly below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.62 billion. However, the top line grew 4.9% year over year. The improvement was driven by 2.6% positive impact from organic revenue growth and 3.5% gain from the acquired assets of Engineered Fasteners & Components (completed in 2016). However, the positives were partially offset by 1.2% adverse impact from unfavorable foreign currency movements.Segmental Details: Illinois Tool Works reports its revenues under the segments discussed below:Test & Measurement and Electronics' revenues increased 2.5% year over year to $519 million.

131,ITW,"We issued an updated research report on Illinois Tool Works Inc. (ITW  -  Free Report) on Jul 2.This machinery company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Its market capitalization is approximately $46.9 billion.Below, we briefly discussed the company’s potential growth drivers and possible headwinds.Factors Favoring Illinois ToolGrowth Projections: Illinois Tool pulled off better-than-expected results in the last four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 3.28%. Currently, the company’s Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.97 for second-quarter 2018, $7.78 for 2018 and $8.43 for 2019, representing year-over-year growth of 18.7%, 18.1% and 8.4%, respectively.In 2018, Illinois Tool anticipates gaining from strengthening demand, enterprise initiatives and a healthy business portfolio. It predicts earnings of $7.60-$7.80 per share, above the previous projection of $7.45-$7.65, reflecting year-over-year growth of 17% at mid-point. Organic sales growth is expected to be 3-4%.Over the long term (2018-2022), Illinois Tool expects organic revenue growth to be 3-5%, operating margin to be in excess of 25%, incremental margin to be 35% and earnings per share to grow 8-10% in each year. Also, after-tax return on invested capital is projected to be above 20%.Strategic Initiatives: Illinois Tool’s Enterprise Strategy — including Business Structure Simplification, Portfolio Management and Strategic Sourcing ??? has helped in maximizing profits through the development of improved products and reasonable cost control. These enterprise initiatives are likely to contribute 100 basis points to operating margin growth in 2018.Moreover, the company believes in making investments to acquire businesses. It acquired Engineered Fasteners and Components in July 2016, which has been boosting the Automotive OEM business of the company since then.Shareholder-Friendly Policy: Rewarding shareholders handsomely through dividend payments and share buybacks have always remained Illinois Tool’s priority. The company intends on increasing its dividend payout from 43% to 50% of free cash in August 2018. This increment, currently subjected to the company’s board approval, was earlier scheduled for 2020. Also, it is worth noting that the company hiked its quarterly dividend rate by 20% in August 2017 while it bought back $500 million worth shares in the first quarter of 2018.Factors Working Against Illinois ToolThreats From Global Uncertainties, Share Price Performance: Illinois Tool’s segmental results are highly correlated to industrial, automotive and housing markets of the countries it serves. Trade disputes and unfavorable governmental policies, as well as uncertainties in the global market, can be detrimental for the company. For instance, lower auto builds across the globe in the first quarter of 2018 adversely impacted the company’s Automotive OEM business.Of late, market sentiments are not in favor of Illinois Tool. Its share price has plunged nearly 2% post the release of first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 26 while declined roughly 10.8% in the past three months. The three-month fall underperformed 5.6% decline recorded by the industry it belongs to.Adversaries Arising From Rising Costs: Raw material cost inflation has been lately troubling Illinois Tool. The company’s operating margin in the first quarter of 2018 suffered from 50 bps adverse impact from price/costs. For the second quarter, the company predicts similar net impacts of pricing actions and raw material cost inflation on margins.Long-Term Debt & Weak Cash Position: Illinois Tool is a highly leveraged company. In the last five years (2013-2017), the company’s long-term debt soared 21.8% (CAGR) while some respite came from 7.9% sequential fall recorded in the first quarter of 2018. However, the company’s long-term debt of $6.9 billion is concerning. Also, its total debt to total equity spiked from 65.3% in 2013 to 181.5% in 2017. It was at 181.3% in the first quarter of 2018.Moreover, the company’s cash position has weakened over time. In the last five years (2013-2017), its cash and cash equivalents went down 3.1% (CAGR) while the same was down 37.3% sequentially in the first quarter of 2018.Stocks to ConsiderSome stocks worth considering in the industry are Twin Disc, Incorporated (TWIN  -  Free Report), Kadant Inc. (KAI  -  Free Report) and Altra Industrial Motion Corp. (AIMC  -  Free Report). While both Twin Disc and Kadant sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Altra Industrial Motion carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.In the last 60 days, earnings estimates for each of these stocks have improved for the current year. Also, average positive earnings surprise for the last four quarters has been 250.43% for Twin Disc, 15.50% for Kadant and 5.06% for Altra Industrial Motion.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 19X over. Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we're willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation.See Them Free>>

"

"
144,ITW,"•    Bottom Up estimates:  $61.62 for 2009, $76.70 for 2010
"
145,ITW,"•    Top Down estimates: $54.38 for 2009, $70.05 for 2010Welcome to the new Earnings Trends. We have decided to start focusing our analysis of the S&P 500 based on Zacks' own sector groupings rather than the S&P GICS sectors. There are 16 Zacks sectors and only 10 GICS sectors, so the new groupings will result in better granularity of the data. The old way simply grouped too many very different companies together. In addition, we for the first time are presenting top-line as well as bottom-line expectations and surprise information. This is very much a work in progress, and we will be adding additional information, tables and perhaps even some graphs over the next few months.
"
146,ITW,"It’s almost time to close the books on a fantastic earnings season. With almost 90% of reports in, there have been 339 that have exceeded expectations while only 62 have fallen short -- a ratio of 5.47. While it is true that most companies will normally try to under-promise and over-deliver, this quarter the beats are beating the misses by about twice the normal margin of 3:1.
"
147,ITW,"Nor have all the surprises only been by a penny or two, but there have been lots of companies that simply crushed their earnings estimates. The median surprise is a very high 7.11%. Over the last five years, a median surprise of about 3.0% has been normal. Part of the reason is that expectations were set very low going into the earnings season.
"
148,ITW,"For most companies, their earnings are still below year ago levels, just not as far down as people thought they would be. Only 193 firms have posted positive year-over-year growth, versus 251 that have fallen short of year-ago levels -- a ratio of 0.77.
"
149,ITW,"The disparity between firms beating estimates but having negative year-over-year earnings growth is particularly noticeable in Tech, where the earnings surprise ratio is an awesome 9.25. However, the growth ratio (# of firms with positive growth/# of firms with negative growth) is just 0.49. A similar situation, but not quite as extreme, is true for Materials. Staples and Medical have been both growing earnings and beating expectations.
"
150,ITW,"On the top line, it has also been a successful season so far (relative to expectations), but in terms of actual year-over-year growth it has been downright ugly  The total revenues of the 444 firms that have already reported are 13.4% below year-ago levels. A total of 241 firms have reported higher-than-expected revenues, versus 176 that have disappointed, for a ratio of 1.37. On the other hand, only 127 actually had higher sales than a year ago, versus 314 with lower revenues, a ratio of 0.40. Put another way, only 28.6% of all firms reporting so far have had higher sales than a year ago.
"
151,ITW,"In other words, cost-cutting has been the major force driving earnings and earnings surprises. However, the costs to one company are either the revenues of another company or someone’s paycheck, which is then spent to create revenues for firms. The bottom-up data coming out of all these individual firms seems to confirm what we have been getting from the government's macro statistics. The economy is growing due to increases in productivity. Higher GDP with fewer workers.
"
152,ITW,"However, the strategy seems to be working, as earnings are coming in much better than expected and analysts have responded by increasing earnings estimates for 2009. The estimate increases are widespread across sectors, with five sectors seeing more than five increases for each cut. No sector is seeing more cuts than increases.
"
153,ITW,"For the S&P 500 as a whole, the revisions ratio now stands at 3.26, its highest level in over a year and in distinct contrast to earlier in the year when it fell below 0.15 at one point. The better-than-expected earnings are translating into estimate increases for 2010 as well as 2009, with a revisions ratio of 2.15 for next year.Scorecard & Earnings Surprise

"
163,ITW,"In evaluating the data presented here, keep the percentage reported in mind; for some sectors, the sample size is extremely small. The move to the 16 Zacks sectors means that even when all reports are in, some of the sectors will still have relatively few firms in them. For firms with only a few reports in, the median surprise will be very volatile as new firms are added to the sample.
"
164,ITW,"Overall, two small sectors, Conglomerates and Business Services, appear to have the most impressive performance so far this quarter on the surprise front. Among the larger sectors, strong arguments could be made for Staples having the best surprise profile.Scorecard & Earnings SurpriseIncome SurprisesYr/Yr

"
225,ITW,"•    Total Revisions activity approaching peak for this earnings season
"
226,ITW,"Analysts are responding to better-than-expected 3Q earnings by raising 2009 estimates almost across the board. Unlike the data presented above for the surprises, the revisions data is for all 500 firms in the index. Total revisions activity has picked up dramatically, and will continue to do so over the next week or two, but we are getting towards peak activity.
"
227,ITW,"The broad increases in earnings estimates seems to reflect a much better short-term outlook for the economy. Note that some of the most cyclical areas such as Retailers, Materials and Autos are seeing a large preponderance of upward over downward earnings revisions, and that most of the firms in those sectors are seeing their consensus estimates increase.
"
228,ITW,"On the other hand, the defensive Staples sector has a very high revisions ratio of 8.71, so it’s not just the cyclicals. Then again given the great performance by the Staples on the surprise front, a strong estimate revisions performance is not surprising.The Zacks Revisions Ratio: 2009Sector %Ch

247,ITW,"For a large sector, the revisions ratio of 9.07 for the Industrials is extremely impressive, and would seem to support the idea that the economy is gaining some real traction.  More than five times as many firms in the sector saw their mean estimate for 2010 rise over the last month than suffered a decline in their expectations. Some of the firms in the sector that have seen double-digit increases in both their mean estimate and double-digit numbers of estimate increases and have had no cuts over the last month include Caterpillar (CAT  -  Free Report), Eaton (ETN  -  Free Report) and Illinois Tool Works (ITW  -  Free Report).  The Zacks Revisions Ratio: 2010 Sector  %ChNext Fiscal Yr Est - 4 wks  #Firms Up #Firms Down #Ests Up #Ests DownRevisionsRatio Firms up/downConsumer Staples 3.75 31 9 196  35 5.60 3.44 Consumer Discretionary 3.09 24 6 176  52 3.38 4.00 Retail/Wholesale 2.80 36 9 288  56 5.14 4.00 Medical 1.41 26 17 278  168 1.65 1.53 Auto 3.53 3 3 23  13 1.77 1.00 Basic Materials 3.01 13 7 98  42 2.33 1.86 Industrial Products 8.31 16 3 127  14 9.07 5.33 Construction 0.62 6 3 34  27 1.26 2.00 Conglomerates 1.88 7 1 60  22 2.73 7.00 Computer and Tech 5.18 57 17 584  151 3.87 3.35 Aerospace -1.49 4 6 51  76 0.67 0.67 Oils and Energy 1.95 28 13 268  165 1.62 2.15 Finance -2.50 37 39 450  353 1.27 0.95 Utilities -0.57 17 20 61  73 0.84 0.85 Transportation -0.15 5 5 43  36 1.19 1.00 Business Service 2.38 6 2 50  12 4.17 3.00 S&P 2.06 316 160 2787 12952.15 1.98

Delta is scheduled to report earnings on Wednesday, Oct 15, before the start of trading.

269,ITW,"Companies That Could Issue Negative Earnings SurprisesIllinois Tool Works (ITW  -  Free Report) cut its third-quarter guidance on Tuesday, hurt by a slowdown in North American industrial production in September. The company has not been able to raise prices to compensate for higher raw material costs due to the economic downturn. Analysts have accordingly adjusted their quarterly profit forecast to 87 cents per share, down from 94 cents. The most accurate estimate is more bearish at 85 cents. Illinois Tool Works is scheduled to report quarterly results on Thursday, Oct 16, before the start of trading.

275,ITW,"Aditi Samajpati contributed to this article.1Some of the companies listed in the earnings calendar may not be in the Zacks Rank universe.
"
276,ITW,"The industrial sector has been a bit of a mixed bag over the past few months. Residential construction equipment has been weak, as would be expected. Sales of truck-related equipment has also been lackluster, a reflection of the impact of new environmental regulations that went into effect at the beginning of the year. On the other hand, electrical equipment has sold well thanks to ongoing demand from utilities. Hydraulics and fluid control systems also remain in demand, particularly for use in aerospace and energy. Internationally, especially in economies that are growing faster than the U.S., demand for many industrial products is strong.
"
277,ITW,"Although not ideal, this backdrop has provided enough strength to help several Machinery-General Industrial companies exceed second-quarter expectations, including Cooper Industries (CBE) and Eaton (ETN  -  Free Report). 
"
278,ITW,"CBE earned 78 cents per share from continuing operations in the second quarter, a penny ahead of estimates and 22% above year ago levels. Revenues rose 14% and reached $1.46 billion. Sales of electrical products increased 15%, reflecting higher demand from both utility and industrial customers and well as the positive impact of acquisitions. Tool segment revenues were materially helped by the weak dollar, though aerospace helped to offset weakness in the motor vehicle market. Approximately two-thirds of the covering brokerage analysts raised their full-year forecasts following the report, sending the consensus estimate up by three cents to $3.11 per share.
"
279,ITW,"ETN surpassed expectations by 24 cents with operating earnings of $1.70 per share; profits were up 1% from a year prior. Revenues rose 4% to $3.25 billion. Sales were boosted by electrical and fluid power products, acquisitions and the weak dollar; offsetting these positives was a 23% decline in the truck segment. CEO Alexander Cutler believes demand for electrical products will strengthen somewhat in the second half of the year. Based on this expectation, and the impact of continued cost-cutting initiatives, Cutler raised his full-year profit guidance by 30 cents to between $6.75 and $6.95 per share. Nearly all of the covering brokerage analysts adjusted their forecasts in response, sending the consensus estimate up to $6.78 per share.
"
280,ITW,"CBE is a Zacks #2 Rank (buy) stock and ETN is a Zacks #1 Rank (strong buy) stock. Three other Zacks #2 Rank stocks within Machinery-General Industrial also recently exceeded earnings: Danaher (DHR  -  Free Report), Illinois Toolworks (ITW  -  Free Report) and Grainger (GWW  -  Free Report). 
"
281,ITW,"Ongoing strength within the aerospace sector also helped Honeywell (HON  -  Free Report) and Textron (TXT  -  Free Report).
"
282,ITW,"HON earned 78 cents in the second-quarter, two cents above expectations and 24% above year prior levels. Revenues rose 8% to $8.5 billion. Aerospace sales were 13% higher, boosted by strong demand from the commercial sector. Margins for this segment were higher as well. The conglomerate also realized a double-digit increase in its automation and control solutions business unit. Looking forward, HON expects to earn between $3.10 and $3.16 per share this year; previously, the company had forecast profits of $3.00 to $3.10 per share. The majority of the covering brokerage analysts raised their full-year projections in response, pushing the consensus estimate up five cents to $3.14 per share.
"
283,ITW,"TXT reported adjusted second-quarter profits of $1.94 per share versus $1.34 a year prior; the consensus estimate had called for earnings of $1.45 per share. Revenues rose 15% to $3.2 billion. Growth was primarily driven by Cessna, which enjoyed both higher volume and improved pricing. Commercial helicopter sales and profits were also higher. The company believes the strong momentum in the commercial sector will continue and raised its forecast as a result. TXT now expects full-year continuing operation earnings to come in a range of $6.35 to $6.55 per share; previously, the company had forecast profits between $6.10 and $6.30 per share. All eight of the covering brokerage analysts revised their projections in response, causing the consensus estimate to jump by 27 cents to $6.56 per share.
"
284,ITW,"HON is a Zacks #2 Rank stock and TXT is a Zacks #1 Rank stock. Both stocks are classified in Diversified Operations. 
"
285,ITW,"Several banks reported last week. As expected, weakness in the housing market led to an increase in bad loan reserves. Another factor at play was net interest spreads, which some banks observed were compressed. The problem facing banks is that depositors are seeking higher rates at the same time lending standards are tightening. This scenario makes it harder for banks to achieve profitability. Smaller, regional banks, which lack the broader portfolio of products that the large national banks can rely on to help boost overall margins, were particularly affected by the combination of higher bad loan reserves and narrowing net interest spreads.
"
286,ITW,"Among the regional banks that brokerage analysts have recently cut full-year estimates on are Associated Bancorp (ASBC), First Community Bancorp (FCBP) and Pinnacle Financial Partners (PNFP  -  Free Report).

291,ITW,"Industrial tool maker Illinois Tool Works Inc. (ITW  -  Free Report) reported impressive bottom-line results for second-quarter 2017. Earnings in the quarter came in at $1.69 per share. Excluding benefits of 3 cents from a legal settlement, adjusted earnings were $1.66, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.63.Also, the bottom-line of $1.63 topped the year-ago tally of $1.46 by 13.7%. Further, it exceeded the guidance range of $1.55−$1.65. The year-over-year improvement can be attributed to a 3.1% reduction in the company’s share count due to its ongoing share buyback activity. Earnings were also boosted by its enterprise initiatives.Revenues in the quarter totaled $3.599 billion, slightly below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.62 billion. However, the top line grew 4.9% year over year. The improvement was driven by 2.6% positive impact from organic revenue growth and 3.5% gain from the acquired assets of Engineered Fasteners & Components (completed in 2016).

293,ITW,"The first-quarter earnings season is rapidly unwinding with 87 members of the S&P 500 index already having released results. By the end of this week, more than half of the S&P 500 members will have reported financial numbers. The trajectory so far indicates that growth of earnings and revenues are treading materially above historical levels.Per the latest Earnings Preview, total earnings for the companies who have reported are up 25% year over year on 10.7% higher revenues. The beat ratio is impressive with 82.8% companies surpassing bottom-line expectations and 67.8% outperforming on the top-line front. In fact, 62.1% of companies have topped both EPS and revenue estimates.Clearly, the first quarter of 2018 is projected to register better earnings growth and revenue momentum than what we have witnessed in the previous quarters. Overall earnings for all the S&P 500 are expected to be up 18.3% on 7.7% growth in revenues. This represents an improved growth projection from the previous quarter and is likely to be driven by a corporate tax overhaul and relatively healthy job data.In fact, we expect double-digit year-over-year earnings growth for 11 of the 16 Zacks sectors. The Industrial Products sector, placed at the top 6% out of the 16 Zacks sectors, is one of the sectors expected to record double-digit earnings growth, mainly driven by the U.S. tax reforms.After struggling with soft commodity prices, reduced investment in the energy sector and dismal economic conditions in some developed and developing nations in the last few years, the sector seems to have regained its momentum in 2017. The turnaround was primarily driven by higher infrastructure spending and other growth-friendly policies of the new administration. Rise in manufacturing and mining activity also played a crucial role.Industrial production is one of the leading economic indicators for industrial stocks. For first-quarter 2018, industrial production — a measure of output at factories, mines and utilities — rose at an annual rate of 4.5%. Also, the Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) tally was 59.3% in March. This indicates strong growth in manufacturing, led by continued expansion in new orders, production activity, employment and inventories.According to our latest projections, the sector is projected to log an earnings growth of 25.8% in first-quarter 2018 on the back of 12.8% rise in revenues.However, this does not ensure earnings beat for all companies in the space. A company’s earnings outperformance is dependent on the overall business environment as well as management’s ability to implement operating and strategic plans. Notably, our research shows that when a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) stock is combined with a positive Earnings ESP, the chance of beating earnings estimates is high.It should be noted that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revisions momentum. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Let’s take a sneak peek at some companies from the sector scheduled to report quarterly figures tomorrow and see how things are shaping up for the upcoming results.Illinois Tool Works Inc.

295,ITW,"Milacron Holdings Corp. (MCRN  -  Free Report) is slated to report first-quarter 2018 results before the market opens on Apr 26.In the last reported quarter, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of nearly 20.5%. Notably, Milacron surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three out of the last four quarters, resulting in an average surprise of 9.4%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Milacron Holdings Corp. Price and EPS Surprise  Milacron Holdings Corp. Price and EPS Surprise | Milacron Holdings Corp. QuoteKey Factors to ConsiderMilacron’s orders increased 9% year over year to $1.3 billion in 2017. It also ended the year with a solid backlog of $287 million. This was driven by strong order levels in the aftermarket business in North America, China, and particularly in the hot-runner business and India-based equipment business. This robust backlog will drive the company’s first-quarter performance.On the equipment front, the company’s India business delivered double-digit top line growth in 2017. The India manufacturing facility is undergoing another round of expansion in order to meet market demand. Thus, Milacron believes the country is an important element of equipment growth strategy, where business will continue to expand.In addition, the company expects its profitability to be supported by revenue growth and margin expansion in the near term. Its focus on sales of aftermarket services and parts, execution of corporate buying agreements with select customers, geographic expansion of certain product lines, and incremental share gain from new products will drive revenues.Notably, Milacron’s Advanced Plastic Processing Technologies (APPT) segment will benefit from rising demand in the plastic processing machinery industry, backed by the overall estimated increase in plastic processing, increasing equipment age and continuing advancement in technology. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment sales is pegged at $163 million for the first quarter, reflecting 3.8% year-over-year improvement.In the Melt Delivery and Control Systems (MDCS) segment, the hot-runner market is predicted to grow faster than the overall global economy based on macro-economic drivers involving product life cycles, demographics, technology conversion and growing demand of plastic. Our consensus estimates indicate that sales of Milacron’s MDCS segment will reach $106 million in the to-be-reported quarter, reflecting 6% year-over-year growth.Further, its fluids segment will grow on elevated demand for technology fluids, driven by environmental and health concerns, and increasing prevalence of exotic metals. We expect that quarterly sales for the segment will likely be $31 million, up around 6% year over year.Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Milacron’s earnings per share is pegged at 39 cents for the first quarter, underlining year-over-year growth of roughly 21.9%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total sales of $299 million also indicates nearly 5% growth from the prior-year quarter.However, the company stated that the first-quarter equipment sales volume is typically the lowest of the year due to timing of customers' capital-spending programs. Furthermore, input-cost inflation, particularly steel, will continue to be a headwind and impact margins in the quarter to be reported.Milacron’s shares have underperformed the industry it belongs to over the past year, affected by the prevalent headwinds. The stock has gained around 10% compared to nearly 23% growth recorded by the industry.Earnings WhispersOur proven model shows that Milacron is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP, and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Milacron is +2.33%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate of 40 cents comes in higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 39 cents.  A favorable Earnings ESP serves as a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Milacron currently carries a Zacks Rank #3. It should be noted that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings.Conversely, stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.The combination of Milacron’s Zacks Rank #3 and Earnings ESP of +2.33% makes us confident of a likely earnings beat.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Alarm.com Holdings, Inc.

299,ITW,"The overall economy grew for the 58th straight month in August, according to the most recent Manufacturing ISM Report On Business®. Such momentum bodes well for the machinery industry, which is working on its own impressive winning streak both in the economy as a whole and on the Zacks Industry Rank list. Two industries in particular find themselves, once again, in enviable positions on the Rank, namely General Machinery and Construction/Mining Machinery. 
"
300,ITW,"Last months PMI was 54.5%, marking the 39th straight month of growth in the manufacturing economy. (A reading above 50% indicates expansion while a reading under 50% indicates contraction). Augusts reading was 0.2% less than July, but strength in new orders and production continued for the sector.  
"
301,ITW,"Construction/Mining Machinery is benefiting from this continuing strength in the economy and manufacturing. The space has a Zacks Industry Rank of 2.67, which places it 32nd out of more than 200 industries. There is one Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) company in the arena and three Zacks #2 Ranks (Buy). Therefore, approximately 44% of the space has a Buy rating.  
"
302,ITW,"Just a little further down the list is General Machinery with a Zacks Industry Rank of 2.73, putting it in 48th place. There are 33 companies with a Zacks Rank in this space, which is many more than Construction/Minings three. Two companies have a Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) Rank while a dozen are Zacks #2 (Buy) Ranks. As a result, about 42% of the industry has a Buy rating.   
"
303,ITW,"Many economists expect an increase of 3% to 3.5% in the U.S. economy this year, which should help to keep domestic manufacturing demand moving in the right direction. In addition, companies have a number of opportunities overseas, especially in emerging economies like China and Russia. While volatility in the worlds energy markets will continue to inspire caution with market watchers and investors, there appears to be more than enough opportunities to generate profit in these energetic machinery spaces. Leaders in the IndustryIllinois Tool Works Inc. (ITW  -  Free Report) is a diversified manufacturer of highly engineered components and industrial systems and consumables.  
"
304,ITW,"This Zacks #2 Rank (Buy) stock posted second quarter earnings per share of 81 cents in late July, which eclipsed the consensus by almost 4%. In the year-ago quarter, Illinois Tool Works earned 64 cents. The year-over-year advance was attributed to several factors, including reasonable North American market demand, improving international end market activity and strong operating margin performance. Revenues in the quarter improved to $3.58 billion from $3.29 billion in second quarter 2005.  
"
305,ITW,"Last month, Illinois Tool Works reiterated its third quarter and full-year 2006 earnings per share guidance. It continues to expect between 78 cents and 82 cents per share for the quarter, and between $3.03 and $3.11 for the year. Over the past two months, analysts have raised their earnings expectations for this year and next year by six cents each. That accounts for a rise of approximately 2% and 1.8% respectively. Such upward revisions is the main reason for Illinois Tool Works high Zacks Rank.

Earnings per share grew 17.4% over the past five years and are forecasted to grow 12.3% over the next 3-5 years.
"
318,ITW,"On Apr 20, 2006, ITW beat the Streets earnings estimate by 3.2% when it posted first-quarter 2006 earnings per share of $1.29. The company crushed its earnings in the first quarter of 2005 by 21.7%. Operating revenues increased to $3.30 billion, compared to $3.05 billion in the prior-year period. The company attributed its strong results to strong product demand, and remains optimistic going forward due to the high potential of future acquisitions.
"
319,ITW,"ITW projects second-quarter earnings per share of between $1.52 and $1.58. The company also upped its full-year 2006 earnings guidance to between $5.89 and $6.07 per share.

"
323,ITW,"The markets recent volatility spawned a good deal of angst among investors in recent weeks.  The more economically sensitive and cyclical industries such as machinery have particularly reflected investors worries.  Of course, it doesnt help that the machinery industry has underperformed the S&P so far in 2005 either.  But a number of analysts believe that the space has more to give if the right companies are targeted.  Encouraging quarterly reports from the likes of Illinois Tool Works and Caterpillar affirm this point.  Also of note is general industrial machinerys Zacks Industry Rank of 2.84, which according to Nick Raichs  Weekly Earnings and Sector Update,  places it 73rd out of more than 200 industries. 
"
324,ITW,"Most analysts agree that diversified manufacturing stocks will be the best performers, especially in the near-term.  These companies are better poised to weather both the economic headwinds and also the much more dangerous emotional rumblings from investors.  Solid organic growth mixed with smart acquisitions are two factors that continue to give these companies potential.  Take for example the recent report from the above-mentioned Illinois Tool Works, which has about 650 operations in 45 countries.  Not only did the companys earnings per share improved by 14% on a year-over-year basis, but ITW also raised its 2005 outlook.   
"
325,ITW,"Another important aspect to machinery companies revolves around the end markets that they serve.  One of the biggest reasons for this industry volatility rests with their end markets.  If a company serves cyclical markets, then that will be reflected in its earnings.  Once again, the importance of diversified operations comes to forefront.  Pricing flexibility is also an important aspect since this could lead to margin expansion. 
"
326,ITW,"As with many other industries during less-than-spectacular times, there are a lot of ifs when it comes to machinery.  If you are able to find a company with strong characteristics, then you might be able to profit while those around you fall.  But if is a pretty big word when it comes to investing.  Your best resource for under such circumstances are to use the insights of the Wall Street analysts.  These experts can take a lot of the guesswork out of investing and give your portfolio the tune-up its needs to run more efficiently.  What Do the All Stars Recommend?

Industrial production – a measure of the level of output of manufacturing, mining and utilities sectors in a country – grew at an annual rate of 4.7% in the second quarter, driven by impressive growth in mining and utilities.

336,ITW,"Machinery is an economically sensitive and rather cyclical industry.  Luckily for investors, we are in one of the more beneficial cycles at the moment.  This is underscored in Nick Raichs  Weekly Earnings and Sector Update,  where the machinery space holds a Zacks Industry Rank of 2.67, or 42nd out of more than 200 industries. 
"
337,ITW,"The industry continues to have broad-based strength with little evidence of waning, according to Jeff Hammond, manufacturing analyst for KeyBanc Capital Markets.  Hammond said machinery moved from recession to recovery during the 2003/2004 period, and is now switching gears from recovery to expansion in 2005.  Investors should know that growth does moderate once the industry fully recovers from a recession, but Hammond says the environment still remains favorable.   
"
338,ITW,"The principal driver for the machinery industrys solid performance comes from pent-up replacement demand.  After three years of underspending, companies finally felt comfortable enough to start spending again and found that they had a lot of ground to cover.  Other factors including increasing productivity and capacity expansion spending, which Hammond says hasnt even kicked in yet.   
"
339,ITW,"However, as every investor knows, an advantageous industry is not enough to ensure your full profit potential.  Hammond looks at several company-specific issues to get an edge.  Internal differentiation, such as the quality of the management team, is a very important factor.  Also, while many machinery companies are fairly diversified, Hammond says its also very important to study the end markets that a company serves, since some are more interesting and better-positioned than others.  Finally, since this is an economically sensitive space, Hammond wants to find companies that work on being less cyclical.   
"
340,ITW,"Therefore, its very important to get the insights of analysts like Hammond before venturing out into any industry, including those that are on the rise.  In addition to the domestic angle, machinery companies also have big ambitions globally, especially in emerging markets in Asia such as China.  You need to have all the information possible for a cyclical industry full of heavily diversified companies.  With the help of analysts, your portfolio could become a well-oiled machine with portfolio exposure to this industry.  What Do the All Stars Recommend?

The company’s share price went down 9.6% at the close of trading session on Jan 31.The company is slated to release its fourth-quarter results on Feb 27, 2018 before the market opens.In the last three months, the company’s shares have declined 8.6%, underperforming 9.1% gain of the industry it belongs to. Inside the HeadlinesIn the fourth quarter, Broadwind Energy’s net sales totaled $18 million, falling short of $20 million predicted for the quarter primarily due to a fall in gearing shipments and CNG sales.Revenues from the Gearing segment were $8.5 million, below the expected range of $9-$9.5 million. Despite a surge of 150% in gearing orders, the shipments suffered due to delay from supply chain partners.Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, share-based payments and restructuring costs (EBITDA) are likely to fall in the ($3.5)-($3.7) million range, weaker than ($2)-($3) million predicted. Broadwind Energy anticipates strong backlog and new orders to support the Gearing segment’s volume in the third quarter of 2018. Also, the company anticipates gaining from strengthening tower business.

366,ITW,"Illinois Tool Works Inc. (ITW  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 26, before the market opens.The industrial products and equipment manufacturer’s financial performance in the last four quarters was impressive. Illinois Tool Works pulled off an average positive earnings surprise of 4.16%. In the last reported quarter, its earnings of $1.70 per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.62 by 4.94%.However, its share price movements have not been impressive. In the last six months, the company’s shares have declined 0.6%, below 1.2% gain recorded by the industry it belongs to.Let us see how things are shaping up for Illinois Tool Works this quarter. Factors to Affect Q1 ResultsBased on available data for few economic indicators, we can ascertain that operating conditions were quite favorable for industrial machinery companies in the first quarter of 2018. Industrial production in the quarter grew at an annual rate of 4.5%. Also, ISM Purchasing Managers’ Index for March pointed toward an expanding manufacturing sector — reflecting growth in new orders, production activities, employment, new export orders and inventories. New orders of U.S.-made machinery increased roughly 9.2% year over year in the first two months of 2018.Besides these, favorable growth in the U.S. housing markets, as well as growing domestic and world economy, might have proved beneficial for industrial machinery stocks. In the first quarter, housing starts increased roughly 4.9% compared with the previous quarter. Also, the implementation of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act in December last year will have its positive impacts in forms of lower tax rates.Narrowing down to the company level, we believe that Illinois Tool Works’ greatest strength is its diversified business portfolio. It operates through seven business segments, which lowers risks of losses due to weakness in one or more segments. Rising production of cars in the U.S. in the first quarter compared with the previous quarter will support growth of the Automotive OEM segment. Also, the company’s efforts to increase content per vehicle, as well as content-demand from international buyers and growing acceptance of electric vehicles globally, will be a boon.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Automotive OEM segment’s revenues stands at $893 million for the first quarter, above $828 million and $828 million reported in the previous quarter and the year-ago quarter, respectively. Also, the segment’s average sales surprise for the last four quarters was a positive 2.88%.For the Construction Products segment, the first quarter might be a surprise. Its sales in the quarter are predicted to be $434 million, above $412 million and $395 million reported in the previous and the year-ago quarter, respectively. Likewise, the Polymers & Fluids, Specialty Products and Welding segments are set for a likely sales surprise in the first quarter.In the first quarter of 2018, Illinois Tool Works anticipates organic revenue growth to be 3-4%. Tax rate is anticipated to be 24.5-25.5%.However, we remain cautious of the Food Equipment segment. Its sales are forecasted at $526 million, below $548 million reported in the previous quarter but above the year-ago tally of $497 million. The major concerning factor is the average sales surprise of -1.93% in the last four trailing quarters. Also, price cost headwind might be an issue, as the company predicts 30-40 basis points of price cost headwind for 2018.

367,ITW,"Accelerating growth of the global economy, from 3.2% in 2016 to 3.7% in 2017, had been a propeller for many countries, both advanced and emerging, including the United States. Over the two years (2016-2017), the country’s major stock indexes – S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq – have surged 30.8%, 41.9% and 37.9%, respectively. Its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) expanded roughly 1.5% in 2016 and 2.3% in 2017.The International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) growth projections are also encouraging. In its January 2018 report, the IMF predicted that the global output will expand 3.9% in both 2018 and 2019. The U.S. economy is projected to grow 2.7% in 2018 and 2.5% in 2019. These estimates reflect an improvement of 0.4% for 2018 and 0.6% for 2019 from its earlier growth forecasts.Our in-house projections indicate roughly 18% growth in earnings and a 5.6% increase in revenues for the S&P 500 companies in 2018. The earnings projection compares favorably with a growth rate of 9.7% recorded in 2017.We believe that advancement in the global economy and a strengthening domestic market will prove beneficial for demand of industrial machinery. Technological advancement in agriculture and mining industries will require upgraded farming and mining machineries, while growth in demand for packaged foods and beverages across nations will raise need for highly sophisticated food processing and packaging equipment. Further, the need for better infrastructure and residential and non-residential spaces will raise the demand for heavy construction machinery.Industrial production is one of the leading economic indicators for industrial machinery stocks. It measures the level of output of manufacturing, mining and utilities sectors in a country. A brief discussion on the machinery industry in different nations is given below.Industrial Machinery by NationThe United States: Many factors are currently working in favor of industrial machinery companies here. Encouraging job data, with an unemployment rate of 4.1% in February versus 4.7% in the year-ago month, infrastructural improvement plans of the government and strengthening housing markets are some tailwinds.Some other key economic indicators are pointing toward healthy operating conditions in the industry. The country’s industrial production grew 4.4% year over year in February. This marked the highest increase on a year-over-year basis since March 2011. Mining sector expanded 9.7%, utilities 10.5% and manufacturing 2.5%.Also, new orders for U.S.-manufactured machinery in January 2018 grew 11.4% year over year while the ISM Purchasing Managers’ Index or manufacturing index for February expanded 1.7 percentage points from the previous month. The improvement in the ISM Purchasing Managers’ Index suggests expanding economic activities in the manufacturing sector — the key highlights being healthier business conditions, favorable export orders and production, solid backlog and employment growth.Also, the implementation of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act in December 2017 lowered taxes for many corporations, enabling them to invest the free resources in growth projects. However, the government’s tariff imposition on import of steel and aluminum jolted the market somewhat, with fears of possible increase in competitive threats from international players, hike in production costs and retaliatory measures by affected nations.Japan: The country’s economy is still struggling with internal issues, including an aging population and a huge public debt.However, strengthening exports driven by a rise in automobile shipments, improvements in domestic demand induced by healthy growth in private investments and improving employment and wage rates will be beneficial. The country’s GDP grew 1.5% year over year in the fourth quarter of 2017 while registering a 0.5% rise over the previous quarter.According to the report from Japan’s Cabinet Office, core machinery orders (an indicator of capital spending by companies in the next six to nine months)increased 8.2% in January 2018. However, this is predicted to decline 1.5% in the first quarter of 2018 while total machinery orders are predicted to fall 6.9%.The IMF increased its growth projection for the country by 50 basis points (bps) to 1.2% for 2018 and by 10 bps to 0.9% for 2019.China: China’s GDP grew 6.8% year over year in the fourth quarter of 2017 while it expanded 6.9% in 2017, higher than the government’s target of 6.5%. Healthy export demand, flexible property market and rising manufacturing activities were the prime growth drivers.The country’s industrial production improved 7.2% year over year in both January and February 2018. Electricity, gas and water production as well as manufacturing sectors flourished while the mining recovered during the period.For 2018, the government of China anticipates economy to grow roughly 6.5%. We believe that robust investment for the development of infrastructure and transportation will boost the economy and spur demand for industrial machinery. Also, the country’s efforts to lower its debt burden will be advantageous. However, the possibilities of a trade war with the United States, triggered by its imposition of tariffs on steel and aluminium, might be a concerning factor for the both the countries’ trade relations.The IMF projects economy of China to grow 6.6% in 2018 and 6.4% in 2019, up roughly 10 bps from the respective previous estimates.India: The country’s major economic decisions — including demonetization and goods and services tax — along with other strategies to make the country a prime manufacturing hub for all nations across the world are expected to drive its economic growth. Also, favorable domestic job market, low interest rates allowing easy accessibility to cheap loans, infrastructure investments, healthy export demand and better monsoon conditions are additional factors that can make the country a favorable investment destination.The country’s industrial production grew 7.5% year over year in January 2018 versus a 7.1% gain recorded in December. Manufacturing output expanded 8.7%, electricity production jumped 7.6% while mere 0.1% growth was registered in mining.According to the IMF, the country is projected to grow 7.4% in 2018 and 7.8% in 2019.Brazil: The country is grappling with uncertainties on the political front that has over time adversely affected the country’s growth opportunities. General elections are due this October with high probability of abandoned initiatives to reform the country’s pension system becoming a major topic of discussion. Moreover, inadequate infrastructure and a still high unemployment rate of 12.6% (in three months ended February 2018) are other major hurdles.Partially negating these, growth in export demand, strengthening spending in the housing markets and rise in consumer confidence are currently strengthening hopes of a turnaround in the Brazilian economy. Also, falling inflation has prompted the country’s Central Bank to ease interest rates. Notably, the interest rate has been lowered 25 bps in March 2018, this being its 10th consecutive rate cut since 2017. The country’s GDP in 2017 grew 1% after 3.5% decline in both 2015 and 2016 and is predicted to grow 3% in 2018.In addition, the country’s industrial production has been encouraging, with year-over-year growth of 5.7% recorded for January 2018. This compares favorably with 4.5% growth in December 2017 and 4.7% in November 2017.The IMF expects the country’s output to grow 1.9% in 2018, reflecting a 40 bps increase from the previous forecast. Also, growth projections for 2019 have been increased 10 bps to 2.1%.Eurozone: The region, amidst all the political uncertainties, is showing improvements in export demand and labor markets. The region’s GDP improved 2.7% year over year in fourth-quarter 2017 while advanced 2.3% in 2017. Industrial production improved 2.7% year over year in January 2018.The unemployment rate was 8.6% in January 2018, down from 9.6% in the year-ago month but stable compared with December.The IMF raised output growth estimates by 30 bps both for 2018 and 2019 to 2.2% and 2%, respectively.Sector and Industry RankingIndustrial machinery stocks are broadly grouped under Industrial Products, one of the 16 broad Zacks sectors. It currently occupies the second position in the Zacks sectors list.Of the 265 industries comprising the Zacks sectors, those in the top half (i.e., industries with the best average Zacks Rank) have higher chances of beating the bottom half (i.e., the industries with the worst average Zacks Rank). (To learn more visit: About Zacks Industry Rank)We believe that investors keen on exposure to industrial machinery companies have reasons to rejoice. Machinery industries with their positions are as follows: electrical products is in the top 2% of the 265 industries while construction and mining equipment is in the top 6%, farm equipment in the top 36% and thermal products in the top 49%.Also, companies dealing in electronics are in the top 15%, material handling products in the top 5%, industrial tools and providing related services is in the top 29% and companies serving general industrial purposes are in the 42%. However, companies dealing in printing equipment for industrial use are in the bottom half at 95%.Performance and Earnings Trend of the SectorIn the past five years, the Industrial Products sector has yielded a solid 35.4% return.In the fourth quarter of 2017, earnings of Industrial Products grew 34.8% year over year, while revenues improved 14.5%. The earnings and sales growth was above 19.6% growth in earnings and 4.8% rise in revenues in the third quarter.Our in-house projections, published in the Earnings Trends report dated Mar 23, indicate roughly 19.6% growth in earnings and 8.2% increase in revenues of Industrial Products sector in 2018. Margins are likely to expand roughly 1%. Growth for earnings and margins is higher than 18.7% and 0.46%, respectively, recorded in 2017, while that for revenues is below 2017-figure of 12.9%.In the next three to five years, earnings of the Industrial Products sector are projected to grow 10.7%.Our TakeInternal requirements as well as export orders play a key role in determining the demand for industrial machineries in any country. We believe that efforts to improve trade relations across nations will be a boon for machinery companies. Also, increase in infrastructural investments, job creation and high consumer-end demand will help in further accelerating growth.It will be interesting to watch the activities of industrial machinery companies, with at least $20 billion market capitalization, including Caterpillar Inc. (CAT  -  Free Report), ABB Ltd. (ABB  -  Free Report), Illinois Tool Works Inc. (ITW  -  Free Report), Deere & Company (DE  -  Free Report), Parker-Hannifin Corp.

Earnings of Deere & Company are predicted to rise 5.67%. The company’s long-term growth prospects seem bright on the back of increasing population, rising living standards, investments in new products and expansion in unexplored geographies.Illinois Tool Works’ earnings are projected to grow 10.10% in the next three to five years.Can Hackers Put Money INTO Your Portfolio?Earlier this year, credit bureau Equifax announced a massive data breach affecting 2 out of every 3 Americans.

368,ITW,"We issued an updated research report on Illinois Tool Works Inc. (ITW  -  Free Report) on Mar 19. A vast customer base in various end markets, gains from 80/20 business process and sound capital allocation strategies are key drivers for the company. On the flip side, risks related to international operations, high debts and industry competition remain concerning.The industrial tool maker, with a market capitalization of approximately $58.4 billion, currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Below, we briefly discuss the company’s potential growth drivers and possible headwinds.Factors Favoring Illinois Tool WorksShare Price Performance and Earnings Estimates Revision: Illinois Tool Works’ financial performance remained better than expected over the last four quarters with an average positive earnings surprise of 4.16%. In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings of $1.70 per share exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4.94%.In the last six months, the company’s shares yielded 15.7% return, outperforming 10% gain of the industry.In the last 60 days, nine brokerage firms raised the company’s earnings estimates for 2018, while five increased for 2019. However, estimates for both the years were lowered by one brokerage firm. Currently, the stock’s Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $7.71 for 2018 and $8.39 for 2019, representing growth of 5.6% and 4.9% from their respective tallies, 60 days ago.Near- and Long-Term Growth Potential Solid: Illinois Tool Works operates through seven business segments — Test & Measurement and Electronics, Automotive OEM, Polymers & Fluids, Food Equipment, Welding, Construction Products and Specialty Products — largely minimizing its risks of loss from the poor performance of any group. Also, a vast customer base in various end-markets, including automotive original equipment manufacturer, automotive aftermarket, general industrial, commercial food equipment, construction and others, is beneficial. Moreover, its 80/20 business process will help it achieve higher operating margins, better capital efficiency and solid return on invested capital.For the first quarter of 2018, the company anticipates GAAP earnings to be $1.80-$1.90 per share. Organic revenues are expected to grow 3-4% in the quarter. For the full year, GAAP earnings guidance has been increased to $7.45-$7.65 per share, reflecting 40 cents growth at the mid-point. The increase reflects the positive impact of tax rate cuts to 25-26% and forex gains.Over the long term (2018 to 2022), the company anticipates organic revenue growth to be 3-5%, operating margin to be in excess of 25%, incremental margin to be 35% and earnings per share to grow 8-10% in each year. Also, after-tax return on invested capital is projected to be above 20%. Free cash flow will likely be more than 100% of the net income.Capital Allocation Strategies: Illinois Tool Works follows sound capital allocation strategies, under which it makes meaningful acquisitions for business expansion, invests for the enhancement of its organic growth and rewards shareholders handsomely.Over time, acquisitions have helped in the development of the company’s core segments while creating new platforms for expanding long-term growth opportunities. Since it got acquired in July 2016, the Engineered Fasteners and Components business has strengthened the company’s Automotive OEM business.The company remains committed toward returning value to shareholders. It raised quarterly dividend rate by 20% in August 2017 and intends to increase the dividend payout rate from 43% to 50% of free cash in August 2018. Earlier, the company expected the dividend rate increment in 2020. However, this increment is still subject to the company’s board approval.Factors Working Against Illinois Tool WorksThreats From International Expansion: Global expansion has exposed Illinois Tool Works to risks rising from adverse movements in foreign currencies. Also, uncertainties in economic growth of the countries served can severely impact its businesses. Its products are sold in 56 countries. Notably, it sourced nearly 56% of its revenues from its international operations.Huge Debts Raise Concerns: Illinois Tool Works’ long-term debt was approximately $7.5 billion exiting the fourth quarter of 2017. We believe, if unchecked, huge debt levels will increase its financial obligations and hence, prove detrimental to its profitability.Industry Competition: Illinois Tool Works faces stiff competition from companies offering similar products and services or those producing different items for same uses. Also, difficulties or delays in research and development or production and services, apart from the failure of new products and technologies in the market, might hurt its competitive edge.Some key players in the industry, sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), are Applied Industrial Technologies, Inc. (AIT  -  Free Report), Dover Corporation (DOV  -  Free Report) and Roper Technologies, Inc. (ROP  -  Free Report). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.In the last 60 days, earnings estimates for each of these stocks improved for the current year and the next year. Also, average positive earnings surprise for the last four quarters was 10.97% for Applied Industrial, 7.26% for Dover and 3.12% for Roper.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions. Apple sold a mere 1 billion iPhones in 10 years but a new breakthrough is expected to generate more than 27 billion devices in just 3 years, creating a $1.7 trillion market.Zacks has just released a Special Report that spotlights this fast-emerging phenomenon and 6 tickers for taking advantage of it.

"
380,ITW,"•    Bottom Up estimates: $62.48 for 2009, $77.11 for 2010
"
381,ITW,"•    Top Down estimates: $54.38 for 2009, $70.05 for 2010Welcome to the new Earnings Trends. We have decided to start focusing our analysis of the S&P 500 based on Zacks' own sector groupings rather than the S&P GICS sectors. There are 16 Zacks sectors and only 10 GICS sectors, so the new groupings will result in better granularity of the data. The old way simply grouped too many very different companies together. In addition, we for the first time are presenting top-line as well as bottom-line expectations and surprise information. This is very much a work in progress, and we will be adding additional information, tables and perhaps even some graphs over the next few months.
"
382,ITW,"It’s almost time to close the books on a fantastic earnings season. With over 90% of reports in, there have been 353 which have exceeded expectations while only 66 have fallen short, a ratio of 5.35. While it is true that most companies will normally try to under-promise and over-deliver, this quarter the beats are beating the misses by about twice the normal margin of 3:1.
"
383,ITW,"Nor have all the surprises only been by a penny or two, but there have been lots of companies that simply crushed the earnings estimates.  The median surprise is a very high 7.11%. Over the last five years, a median surprise of about 3.0% has been normal.
"
384,ITW,"Part of the reason is that expectations were set very low going into the earnings season. For most companies, their earnings are still below year-ago levels, just not as far down as people thought they would be. Only 202 firms have posted positive year-over-year growth versus 259 which have fallen short of year-ago levels -- a ratio of 0.78.
"
385,ITW,"The disparity between firms beating estimates but having negative year-over-year earnings growth is particularly noticeable in Tech, where the earnings surprise ratio is an awesome 8.50. However, the growth ratio (# of firms with positive growth/# of firms with negative growth) is just 0.60. Energy’s surprise ratio is not quite as high, at 3.38, but the disparity to its growth ratio, at just 0.05, is extreme. Staples and Medical have been both growing earnings and beating expectations.
"
386,ITW,"On the top line, it has also been a successful season so far relative to expectations, but in terms of actual year-over-year growth it has been downright ugly. The total revenues of the 462 firms that have already reported are 11.2% below year-ago levels. A total of 253 firms have reported higher than expected revenues, versus 182 that have disappointed, for a ratio of 1.39. On the other hand, only 135 actually had higher sales than a year ago, versus 326 with lower revenues, a ratio of 0.41. Put another way, only 29.2% of all firms reporting so far have had higher sales than a year ago.
"
387,ITW,"In other words, cost-cutting has been the major force driving earnings, and earnings surprise. However, the costs to one company are either the revenues of another company, or someone’s paycheck, which is then spent to create revenues for firms. The bottom-up data coming out of all these individual firms seems to confirm what we have been getting from the macro statistics from the government. The economy is growing due to increases in productivity: higher GDP with fewer workers.
"
388,ITW,"However, the strategy seems to be working as earnings are coming in much better than expected, and analysts have responded by increasing earnings estimates for 2009. The estimate increases are widespread across sectors, with five sectors seeing more than five increases for each cut. No sector is seeing more cuts than increases. For the S&P 500 as a whole the revisions ratio now stands at 3.25, its highest level in a long time and in distinct contrast to earlier in the year when it fell below 0.15 at one point.  The better than expected earnings are translating into estimate increases for 2010 as well as 2009, with a revisions ratio of 2.09 for next year.Scorecard & Earnings Surprise

"
397,ITW,"•    Massive positive surprises in cyclical Construction, Industrial and Discretionary sectors 
"
398,ITW,"In evaluating the data presented here, keep the % reported in mind, for some sectors the sample size is extremely small. The move to the 16 Zacks sectors means that even when all reports are in, some of the sectors will still have relatively few firms in them. For firms with only a few reports in, the median surprise will be very volatile as new firms are added to the sample.
"
399,ITW,"Overall, two small sectors, Conglomerates and Business Services, appear to have the most impressive performance so far this quarter on the surprise front. Among the larger sectors, strong arguments could be made for Staples having the best surprise profile, although Industrials are also in contention.  Scorecard & Earnings Surprise Income Surprises Yr/YrGrowth %Reported SurpriseMedian EPSSurpPos EPSSurpNeg #GrowPos #GrowNegConsumer Staples 1.03% 84.09% 10.87 34 3 25 12Consumer Discretionary -14.07% 100.00% 12.10 22 5 8 22Retail/Wholesale 2.54% 75.56% 5.41 27 5 19 15Medical 3.32% 93.18% 6.09 35 1 32 9Auto -16.45% 100.00% 1.54 3 2 2 4Basic Materials -47.72% 100.00% 6.73 14 4 4 16Industrial Products -25.90% 90.91% 13.92 19 1 9 11Construction 66.67% 81.82% 28.57 6 2 4 5Conglomerates -21.64% 100.00% 16.41 8 0 1 8Computer and Tech -10.93% 87.95% 7.69 51 6 27 45Aerospace -59.63% 100.00% 6.74 8 2 4 6Oils and Energy -62.76% 97.56% 5.20 29 9 2 38Finance 416.90% 100.00% 5.41 56 16 39 39Utilities 5.56% 100.00% 5.63 27 8 23 14Transportation -36.21% 100.00% 3.09 7 2 1 9Business Service 6.73% 88.89% 11.80 7 0 2 6S&P -11.42% 92.40% 7.11 353 66 202 259Sales Surprises

454,ITW,"Machinery companies are lining up to report their third quarter numbers, and analysts believe that most companies are primed to meet or surpass consensus expectations.  In fact, Merrill Lynch analyst Andrew Obin expects top-line growth of +25% for his universe year-over-year.  The industry certainly faces challenges, but that hasnt kept general industrial machinery from registering a Zacks Industry Rank of 2.67, according to Nick Raichs  Weekly Earnings and Sector Update,  which places it 35th out of more than 200 industries.  Additionally, farm machinery also enjoys a ranking of 2.67.  The machinery industry seems set up for a solid third quarter, leaving investors with a good opportunity to make money with a little help from the All Stars.  
"
455,ITW,"The major problem impacting machinery companies these days is high raw material costs, such as steel.  This factor has wreaked havoc across the marketplace, but machinery companies have been able to lessen the blow, and even offset its effect, with pricing increases.  The industry is able to do this because demand has been so high.  
"
456,ITW,"One useful tool for measuring demand amongst machinery stocks, especially industrial machinery, is the Manufacturing ISM Report on Business®.  In September, the ISMs PMI came in at 58.5%, which marked a decrease of 0.5% from August.  However, it remains well above the magic number of 50%, which indicates expansion.  That marked the 16th consecutive month of manufacturing growth.  The September report also indicated encouraging results for production and employment, and stated that the overall economy grew for the 35th straight month.
"
457,ITW,"The manufacturing industry is a very broad space, but there are two companies that garner a special amount of attention from the analysts, namely Caterpillar (NYSE: CAT ) and Ingersoll-Rand (NYSE: IR ), both of which are highlighted below.  These companies have a great breadth of products, but are mainly construction machinery issues.  According to data from the U.S. Census, residential construction spending rose +10.1% in August, while non-residential building has also improved.  Caterpillar and Ingersoll-Rand are looked upon by analysts as two companies positioned well to take advantage of a rather favorable environment.  
"
458,ITW,"So what is the best way to harness the profit potential in machinery?  That of course depends on what kind investor you are, and which analysts you consult.  Some analysts suggest that investors stick with diversified machinery companies, since they are considered safer than sector-specific companies that could get thrown off course on one setback.  Others believe that investors need to place their closest emphasis on future outlooks stretching into 2005.  But analysts are almost in unison when it comes to predicting a strong third quarter for the industry.  So do your homework, listen to a few analysts, and read the company information below, and you may be able to turn your portfolio into a well-oiled, profit-churning machine.What Do the All Stars Recommend?

460,ITW,"Below are the top stocks recommended by the most 5-Star  analysts in the machinery industry.Illinois Tool Works, Inc.  (NYSE: ITW ) is a $10 billion in revenues diversified manufacturer of highly engineered components and industrial systems.  Illinois Tool Works will report its third quarter numbers on October 19.  Its second quarter, which was announced in late July, turned out to be the companys second straight quarter of strong across-the-board results.  The company posted income from continuing operations of $360.4 million, or $1.16 per diluted share.  The result matched the consensus and improved upon the prior years $284 million, or 92 cents per diluted share.  Revenues jumped +17% in that quarter.  A continued improvement in its North American and international end markets led to the solid growth.  The recently completed quarter was gratifying as we achieved record earnings, continued on our upward march to improve operating margins and closed eight acquisitions, which will help us achieve our long-term profitability targets, said W. James Farrell, Chairman and CEO.  Illinois Tool Works revised its full year earnings per share guidance upward to between $4.21 and $4.35, and expects third quarter earnings of $1.05 to $1.11.

464,ITW,"There are several indicators suggesting that the rest of this year, and possibly next, will be a strong period for the machinery industry.  Of all the different segments in this vast space, farm machinery stands out as one of the biggest beneficiaries.  In fact, the farm machinery industry currently enjoys a Zacks Industry Rank of 1.50, according to Nick Raichs  Weekly Earnings and Sector Update,  placing it number one out of more than 200 industries.  The most recent Institute for Supply Management (ISM) manufacturing report showed a PMI that increased +0.4% to 62.8% in May, with the manufacturing sector growing for the 12th straight month and the overall economy moved forward for the 31st consecutive month.  Such data has many analysts optimistic on industries like machinery for the remainder of 2004 at least, which leaves investors with ample opportunity for profit. 
"
465,ITW,"I expect continued expansion in the amount of industrial activity for the second half of 2004, and reasonably confident for expansion in 2005, said Charles Brady, Vice President Senior Equity Analyst at Aperion Group, LLC.  Industrial activity in the first half of 2004 rose in the double-digits from a rather lousy performance in the year-ago period, and the 5-Star analyst says 2005 activity could rise in the high-single digits from 2003.  Brady, who covers the general industrial space, says comments from companies are more positive than five to six months ago, as evidenced by signals of strong underlying data reports such as the above-mentioned ISM numbers and earnings estimates increases for issues like  3M  (NYSE:  MMM ),   Illinois Tool Works  (NYSE:  ITW ), and  Parker Hannifin  (NYSE:  PH ).     
"
466,ITW,"Many of the factors helping the broader machinery space are also positively impacting farm machinery.  Higher replacement demand and stronger farm fundamentals have also aided in this industrys rise from last years malaise.  Higher commodity prices are one of the factors helping farm income, and therefore farm equipment sales, along with low interest rates, tax benefits, and income visibility.  According to the Association of Equipment Manufacturers, U.S. agricultural machinery sales in May were up +3.2% for row crop tractors, up +.5% for four-wheel drive tractors, and up +50% for combines, while small tractors and utility tractors were down -2.3% and -5.1% respectively.  Some people found such numbers to be a bit disappointing, especially for row crop tractors, but it comes on the heels of an exceptionally strong April report and still marks a solid improvement year-to-date.   
"
467,ITW,"However, since farms are vulnerable to uncontrollable events such as poor weather conditions, investors cannot enter the space frivolously and expect to make a profit.  Thats where the insight of analysts come into the equation.  They can help you pinpoint the trends in both the larger machinery industry, and in its more specific farm segment, while also concentrating on company-specific issues.  With a more favorable environment serving as a foundation, and the experience of analysts as a guide, investors can find plenty of opportunity in the farm machinery industry to make sure that you plant a profitable crop in your portfolio.

Deere & Company  (NYSE:  DE ) is the worlds leading manufacturer of agricultural and forestry equipment; a leading supplier of equipment used in lawn, grounds and turf care; and a major manufacturer of construction equipment.  John Deere also manufacturers and markets engines used in heavy equipment and provides worldwide financial services.  Deere & Company is the most recognizable name in the farm machinery industry.  Theres probably no better indication of the strength of this industry than the fact that Deere announced very strong quarterly performance in mid-May.  For its fiscal second quarter, the company earned $1.88 per share, compared with $1.07 last year.  The consensus at the time was expecting $1.75, which marked a more than +7% advance.  Worldwide net sales and revenues reached $5.877 billion, or +34% better than last year.  Strong markets for its products, along with benefits from ongoing business-improvement initiatives, were credited for Deeres new levels of performance and financial returns.  All of Deeres equipment divisions generated higher sales for the quarter and year-to-date.  Equipment sales in the U.S. and Canada improved +39% for the quarter, while sales outside that region advanced +18%, excluding the impact of currency translation.  Robert W. Lane, Chairman and CEO of Deere, stated, We are profitably expanding our market presence throughout the world and winning new customers, with exciting new products and services.

High commodity prices and improving farm income have generated stronger retail activity in North and South America during 2004, according to the company.  Net sales jumped +47% to $1.1 billion The company attributed two factors to its better than expected performance.  The first factor was a strong performance out of its South American operations, where industry unit retail sales of tractors jumped about +25% year-over-year.  Industry retail sales for combines were up +62% in South America during the year.   
"
470,ITW,"The other important factor in AGCOs results was its acquisition of Valtra from Kone Corporation, which was completed on January 5.

Machinery sales in the quarter rose by +41% to $4.15 billion, with sales in North America up +49% year-over-year.  Sales opportunities are increasing, and we are exceptionally well-positioned to benefit with our broad product offerings and strong global dealer network, said Jim Owens, Chairman and CEO of Caterpillar.
