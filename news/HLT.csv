2,HLT,"Home-sharing websites like Airbnb and HomeAway are often seen as stealing customers from traditional lodging businesses. Now the world's largest hotel company thinks it can disrupt the disruptors.XMarriott International (MAR) started offering short-term home rentals in London on its website last month through a partnership with a local company called Hostmaker. If the test goes well, Marriott will expand its home-sharing offerings to other cities, leveraging its loyalty program and expertise in branding to stand out in a crowded field, Chief Executive Officer Arne Sorenson said on an earnings call Wednesday.""As some of these platforms have grown into millions and millions of units, there is almost a paralyzing array of choices and a lack of branding,"" Sorenson said. ""We think we can bring our brands, we can bring our service and product focus, and deliver something which is simply a better product than much of what is out there.""The home-sharing pilot, which Marriott calls Tribute Portfolio Homes, is integrated into its loyalty program, according to a website for the service, and is currently limited to about 200 residences. Marriott studied the business for some time and is testing it only after determining that the company can run it in full compliance with the law, Sorenson said. There are restrictions on short-term rentals in many cities.Marriott isn't the first hotel company to dabble in home-sharing. Accor owns the luxury home-sharing website Onefinestay.

5,HLT,"Neuropsychologist Richard Chaifetz was thinking big when he graduated with his doctorate in 1981.He saw an opportunity to provide broad-based mental health services to the general public and opened a dozen psychological treatment centers in the Midwest, with the goal of a national franchise system. To fund this, he committed to advertising in the Yellow Pages for $10,000 a month charged to a credit card, since he only had a few thousand dollars to his name.""If I hadn't succeeded, I'd have gone bankrupt,"" Chaifetz, the CEO and chairman of ComPsych Corp., told IBD from his Chicago office. ""I knew professionals in the mental health field often didn't have good business acumen, and I saw an attractive opportunity for them if I could provide infrastructure, marketing and oversight. But then the insurance model began to change from direct reimbursement for patients to coverage by HMOs. I expanded services in 1984, pioneering employee assistance programs or EAPs and eventually selling off the mental health centers.""He succeeded, in spades. Today, ComPsych is the world's largest provider of customized programs for improving the lives of workers, ranging from overall wellness and work-life balance to meeting their needs for expert legal and financial help. It serves 100 million people in 160 countries, helping its 45,000 clients, including Comcast (CMCSA) and Hilton Hotels (HLT), to retain their best employees and increase productivity.Crain's Chicago Business last April estimated annual revenues for the privately held company at $475 million for 2016. According to Chaifetz, ""We've always had double-digit growth, so I expect them to estimate an increase of more than 10% for last year.""Chaifetz, 64, was born in Brooklyn, N.Y., and attended Eastern Military Academy in Huntington on Long Island, after his parents divorced. Upon graduation, he was one of only two cadets to receive appointment to the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, but turned it down because the Army wasn't where he wanted to spend his life. At the advice of Eastern's headmaster, he instead attended Saint Louis University in St. Louis, Mo.But in the second semester of his freshman year working towards a degree in psychology, his father, with whom he had little contact after his parents' divorce, stopped paying his tuition and his mother couldn't provide enough on her teacher's salary for him to continue. Chaifetz refused to give up and pleaded with the university president to let him stay, committing not only to pay off his student debt, but to do something big for the university once he became successful.Permission granted, he worked at all kinds of jobs part-time during the school year and full-time in summer, including at mental health facilities, graduating magna cum laude in 1975. He went on to earn his Psy.D at Illinois School of Professional Psychology.""Psychology can be fluffy and I was attracted to the fact that neuropsychology, which is the study of the relationship between brain function and behavior, emotion and cognition, was more scientific and exact in coming to a diagnosis,"" Chaifetz said.He never forgot his promise to Saint Louis University, and in 2007, Chaifetz and his wife Jill donated $12 million as the lead gift to build Chaifetz Arena, an $80 million, 10,600-seat sports facility. They also funded the Chaifetz Trading Center at her alma mater, the Farmer School of Business at Miami University-Oxford in Oxford, Ohio, with $3 million.""We pioneered fully integrated EAPs to cover everything from crisis intervention to disability management, under our GuidanceResources brand, for organizations from small, private concerns to the Fortune 100,"" Chaifetz said. ""To be able to grow globally and serve so many industries, we empower our own employees to solve problems with a custom-fit for client needs. We encourage them not only to innovate, we expect them to challenge the status quo, helping us to avoid falling into the standardization trap that big companies often do.""ComPsych recruits for high-energy, intellectually curious, creative individuals who are willing to test the limits within the boundaries of good business sense. The selection process not only uses extensive interviewing and background checks, but also tests and uses role-playing to make sure candidates fit the culture. The new hires are tasked to create superstars in other organizations and are incentivized by rewards for performance. As boomers retire and more millennials are hired, Chaifetz is confident about the company's future.""Studies have shown that younger people want meaningful work, and we believe our entrepreneurial culture is an excellent fit,"" Chaifetz said.ComPsych has gradually expanded its offerings. One of the most critical is absence management, which helps companies meet the requirements of the two-decade-old U.S. Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) at a lower cost with less liability exposure. Health care organizations have the largest percentage of employees on leave in a given year at 39%, while hotel and hospitality employees have the lengthiest absences overall, averaging more than 30 days. ComPsych's integrated EAPs have helped health care worker absenteeism drop by 43%, while their life satisfaction has risen 59%.Another area where the company excels is in managing the opioid abuse crisis, which cost $20 billion in lost productivity in 2016, yet three-quarters of employers have not offered training on how to detect misuse. The fatality rate is six times higher than the world average, according to the United Nations. ComPsych's multi-pronged approach can include cognitive behavioral therapy, managing inpatient and outpatient treatment by leading providers, coordinating with pharmacies, family support and 24/7 access to online workshops with master-level clinicians.ComPsych's growth has been entirely organic and it counsels clients to be careful about how they go about mergers and acquisitions, since studies show 70% to 90% fail to pay for themselves. Clients are advised to have clearly defined core competencies they can leverage to expand and to avoid trying to merge cultures that are not compatible.""Most M&A problems are not due to miscalculating the financials, but because of the intangible aspects,"" Chaifetz said. ""You're buying the services of people and if their aspirations are not a good fit with the new company culture, financial goals are unlikely to come to fruition. That's where we can play an important role in helping clients make sure that they understand the needs and expectations of new employees.""Enlightened corporate leaders have come to see the cost-effectiveness of employee wellness services, but ComPsych is especially appreciated during crises. During Hurricane Harvey last summer, the company conducted more than 450 critical incident stress management sessions.In 2017, Chaifetz was given the Humanitarian Award by the Illinois Holocaust Museum. ""He always wanted to help people as a psychologist,"" Jill told the audience. ""He's been called the Michael Jordan of his industry, and he's pretty much a savant.""Dale Grenolds, executive vice president at ComPsych, says Chaifetz is the type of leader that lets you take risks and be autonomous.""At the same time, he's very direct in his feedback and clear about his expectations,"" Grenolds said. ""His drive and level of confidence push his people to achieve more and operate from a place of strength. And at times of crisis, he has a unique ability to create clarity and find solutions.""CEO of ComPsych Corp., world's leading provider of employee well-being programs.Overcame: The need for a completely new business model in the early years.Lesson: Attract clients by offering easy solutions for the areas where they have the biggest challenges.""Over-reliance on market research can stifle creativity and create a 'me too' organization which can marginalize opportunities.""

11,HLT,"Will the current creep up in interest rates slow demand in the vacation-resort time share market? One executive answers an emphatic, ""No.""Mike Flaskey, CEO of Diamond Resorts, says his firm is ""very bullish"" and aims to keep expanding in hot leisure destinations such as Hawaii. One piece of proof: the company's recent $225 million purchase of The Modern Honolulu in Oahu.Diamond will upgrade it to meet customers' demands for luxury-style suite accommodations that feature full-size kitchens and one- or two-bedroom formats.""It's a four-star property. We're going to go through it floor by floor,"" Flaskey told IBD during an interview Monday at the Milken Institute Global Conference in Beverly Hills, Calif.Flaskey said that Diamond Resorts generates roughly $100 million in annual sales centered on its collection of membership-based hotels across the entire Hawaiian isles. While Las Vegas is Diamond's top sales market, Flaskey believes Hawaii will in time take the top spot.One leg of Diamond's business is financing the purchase of customers' points-based time share ownership. Flaskey says the typical customer makes a 15% down payment on an average transaction of $24,000. Then he or she borrows to pay off the rest via a loan from Diamond.""Middle America is our customer. The usual household income is between $110,000 and $140,000,"" Flaskey said. ""They are very comfortable with making a regular payment"" to fund the buy. Plus, 30% of Diamond's customers pay off the outstanding loan before maturity.Flaskey's bullish sentiment dovetails with the rising fortunes in recent years among publicly traded hotel companies.The lodging industry veteran foresees the total public market value of timeshare-oriented companies rising to nearly $37 billion within a couple of years. That's up nearly fourfold since the fall of 2013, when Diamond Resorts and competitor Marriott Vacations Worldwide (VAC) totaled less than $10 billion in market cap.Marriott Vacations fell more than 8% in big volume Monday.

Their gains year to date range from 22% for Amphenol to 36% for Global.XAnd to help keep the good times rolling, the $3.2 billion fund is betting on top new buys as of its latest disclosure such as IPG Photonics (IPGP), a maker of fiber-optic lasers for industrial and medical applications; Linux operating system distributor Red Hat (RHT); and semiconductor test-equipment maker Teradyne (TER).Year-to-date gains by those newcomers ranged from 45% by Teradyne to 87% for IPG.

The firm provides child care, early education and other services.It sports a 95 Comp Rating and an A SMR Rating.The rise in Q2 revenue and EPS growth was driven by both new full-service child-care centers and improved results from existing ones, the company said.

But there are several sectors and specific industry groups that are faring well, with Dow components Boeing (BA), Chevron (CVX) and Home Depot (HD) in or near buy zones.IBD'S TAKE: Don't rely on market pundits telling you where they think the market is heading next year. Listen to what the market is saying right by following the major market averages and leading stocks. Read IBD's Stock Market Today columns throughout the market day, and the end-of-day The Big Picture (open access through Oct. 8) for timely analysis.Facebook had been trading tightly in a flat base just below a buy point. But shares fell 4.5% to 162.87 on Monday in heavy volume, tumbling below their 50-day moving average and undercutting the low of their current consolidation. Tesla extended its post-breakout reversal to more than 7% below its 370.10 entry — and through its 50-day to boot — making that buy point invalid. Nvidia round-tripped a 9.5% gain from a buy point, sinking 4.5% to 171, below the 174.66 entry. Apple fell 0.9% to 150.55, following a 5% sell-off last week.Facebook, Tesla and Apple shares did rise a fraction in premarket trading Tuesday. Nvidia climbed nearly 3% after announcing late Monday that it will supply AI-focused chips to several Chinese cloud-computing and server firms.Oil and gas groups and stocks continue to rack up big and steady gains, as crude oil prices have rebounded to their best levels since April.Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) and Valero (VLO) have cleared buy points, while BP (BP) and the Dow's Chevron are close.The key question for these stocks and the broader sector is whether oil and other energy prices keep rising — and when and how quickly shale operators ramp up their production.U.S. crude futures dipped 0.4% in premarket trading to $52 a barrel.Despite Tesla's recent reversal, the broad transportation sector is healthy, from shipping giants FedEx (FDX) and UPS (UPS) to General Motors (GM) and Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) to trucking firms J.B. Hunt Transport (JBHT) and Old Dominion Freight Line (ODFL) to auto- and truck-parts firms such as Dana (DCN) and Lear (LEA) to RV makers Winnebago (WGO) and Thor Industries (THO).Focusing on single-industry success stories, IBD's Aerospace/Defense group is faring well. Boeing and Northrop Grumman (NOC) are among those in buy zones. General Dynamics (GD) is close.Hilton Worldwide (HLT), Marriott International (MAR), and Hyatt Hotels (H) are among several hotel operators that have broken out. But they've generally broken out on light-to-lackluster volume. Casino stocks have been doing well, though Melco Resorts (MLCO) fell below a buy point and Wynn Resorts (WYNN) nearly did so.D.R. Horton (DHI), Toll Bros. (TOL) and LGI Homes (LGIH) are all near buy points.On a related note, Home Depot crept out to a buy point on Monday, but in below-average volume.RELATED:The Big Picture: Tech Stocks Crushed As Nasdaq Reaches A Key TestWhy Tesla May Not Be Leading This Part Of The Self-Driving Race75 Recent Breakouts, And This Stock Is The Biggest Winner So Far?New High Analysis: Nasdaq Sell-Off Spares These 7 StocksFacebook Down As Zuckerberg Scraps Stock Plan, Will Sell Shares

35,HLT,"Bill Marriott is still very active at 85, as the executive chairman and chairman of the board of Marriott International (MAR), the world's largest hotel company. He stepped down as CEO in 2012, after four decades in that position.""I've visited 70 hotels so far in 2017 and I'll get to more than 100 by the end of the year,"" Marriott told IBD from his vacation home on Lake Winnipesaukee, N.H., near those of his children and their kids. That's his relaxed schedule: As CEO, twice that would receive his perfectionist inspections. He's been all over the world, yet he says, ""I love every minute of it right here on the lake.""Travel is important because it ""provides an understanding of how other people live,"" he added. ""My wife and I went with my parents to China in 1979 and there were Mao suits and bicycles everywhere, with everything under tight control. We've watched China emerge to become the second largest economy in the world and it's now a major focus of our expansion and marketing.""People come to America from all over the world with questions and they almost always go away with a better feeling about our country and the great opportunities it provides.""He was born John Willard Marriott Jr. in 1932 in Washington, D.C., where his father and mother, Alice, had opened an A&W Root Beer franchise five years before. They soon added food service and renamed it The Hot Shoppe, where Bill did every kind of job during high school.Marriott graduated from the University of Utah with a degree in finance in 1954. The next year, he married Donna Garff and served as a supply officer on an aircraft carrier to fulfill his ROTC commitment.When he returned in 1956, The Hot Shoppes were expanding and the family was about to open its first hotel in Arlington, Va. It had an ideal location near the airport, but no one understood how to run it, so Bill volunteered. They opened another nearby in 1959, when company sales reached $46 million, and Bill kept pushing to add hotels, while his father resisted taking on more debt.""We were just smart enough to know we had something fresh to offer and just naive enough to go at it with the wide-eyed enthusiasm and energy of a bunch of kids who knew nothing about the business,"" he wrote in his memoir, ""Without Reservations: How a Family Root Beer Stand Grew Into a Global Hotel Company.""Bill was named president in 1964, when sales hit $84 million and they had 9,600 employees and four hotels. Five years later, the publicly held and renamed Marriott Corp. had 11 hotels — including the first foreign one in Acapulco, Mexico — with sales totaling $257 million. It began franchising in 1970 and Bill was made CEO two years later.Over the next decade, the company diversified into cruise ships, theme parks and travel agencies, with $1.5 billion in sales in 1979. Given the size and scope the company had reached, he then put in place a strategic planning unit that helped them focus on hotels and improved the management of change.In 1983, the company had grown to include 131 hotels in 79 cities, before opening the first two Courtyard by Marriott hotels, which Marriott says he considers one of the most important innovations he's overseen. (Forbes magazine ranks the company No. 1 for innovation in the industry.)""We were the first big chain to go down-market, with a moderate-priced offering with nice rooms — with no frills and fewer staff. And everybody told us we were crazy,"" he said. ""Today, we have over 1,000 Courtyard hotels.""Two years later, his father died and Bill was elected chairman of the board.""He took his father's legacy and led it into a modern era by focusing on innovations that the industry has tried to copy, defining the direction of the business and the guest experience of hospitality,"" said Arne Sorenson, president and CEO at the Bethesda, Md., headquarters, where two of Marriott's children are executives (another left to invest in startups).In 1987, the company acquired the Residence Inn chain and opened its first Fairfield Inn, an economy-priced, limited-service line. Two years later, the company went through major restructuring, as debt reached $3.3 billion, selling off its airline-catering and restaurant divisions.In 1993, he implemented the most important innovation of his career, splitting the company into Marriott International, which he would run as an asset-light management firm, and Host Marriott, run by his brother, Richard, which would own real estate and operate concessions. (The concessions business was acquired by Italy-based Autogrill in 1999.)""We didn't invent the management contract, but we created the company that was able to exit from real estate ownership, while our competitors stayed in it,"" he said. ""We expect to use the cash from selling the final couple of dozen properties obtained from the Starwood acquisition over the next few years, to grow the business and enhance shareholder value through dividends and share repurchases.""Marriott's operating margins are around an enviable 50%. For managed hotels, the company is reimbursed for all staffing costs and provides marketing, reservations, and the loyalty platform (Marriott Rewards, Ritz-Carlton Rewards, and Starwood Preferred Guest) at cost, in return for management fees on total revenues. Franchisees generally pay a royalty on room revenue only, a marketing fee, and the cost for reservations and the loyalty program. (They either operate the hotels themselves or contract that to others).""We were the first hotel to develop a frequent-guest stay program in 1984, and everyone said we were crazy — again,"" said Marriott. ""The president of Hyatt said, 'I'll bury you in advertising.' Today, our loyalty programs have 100 million members and we are adding 1 million a month.""One of the keys to Bill Marriott's success has been to follow his father's advice: ""Take care of the associate and the associate will take care of the guest, so the guest will return again and again."" There is a generous benefit program and no limit to advancement, so high retention results in more highly skilled personnel who provide better service (with 675,000 currently wearing the Marriott name tag). Half the general managers came from the hourly ranks, says Marriott, and on average they've been  managers for 25 years. (According to Hilton Hotels (HLT), its managers average 15 years in that role). Part of the company's hiring philosophy has been to screen for those with a friendly personality and dependability, since technical skills can be trained. (Marriott International regularly makes Fortune's list of ""100 Best Companies to Work For."")""Mr. Marriott is more than my boss,"" said Sorenson. ""He's a mentor and a friend.""Last year, the company acquired Starwood Hotel & Resorts Worldwide for $13.6 billion, bringing total properties today to over 6,100 in 124 countries and territories. To Marriott's other top brands, including Ritz-Carlton and Renaissance, Starwood added such high-end names as W Hotels, Westin, Sheraton, Le Meridien, and St. Regis. Marriott International now has 1.2 million rooms, with 430,000 in the development pipeline, and last year reported revenues of $17.1 billion and net income of $780 million (including Starwood numbers from Sept. 23, 2016).Since the 1993 split that created Marriott International, the adjusted stock price has risen from $5 to a recent $100, a 1,900% increase, and it regularly makes Fortune's Most Admired Companies list.Making sure that there are opportunities for workers at the bottom to rise to the top.Overcame: Disasters that challenged the company's ability to retain customers and employees, including 9/11 and the Great Recession.Lesson: Anticipate your customers' needs.""The four most important words in the English language are: 'What do you think?'

Meanwhile, justices said the ban wouldn't affect citizens from Libya, Iran, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen ""who have a credible claim of a bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States,"" such as family members or students enrolled in American schools.The last time the ban was enforced, it made significant impacts on international air bookings, even though it was in effect for only a few days.Between Jan. 28, when Trump signed the ban, and Feb. 4, when Homeland Security suspended the ban, international bookings to the U.S. fell 6.5%, according to travel analysis firm ForwardKeys. Bookings rose in the middle of February, but the effect of the ban still lingered as overall February forward bookings for international arrivals were 0.4% slower vs. a year ago.Also during that period, some employees of tech firms were temporarily prevented from entering the U.S. and others were left wondering about their status, prompting companies like Apple (AAPL), Facebook (FB), Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft to denounce the order or express concern and support for their employees.Delta shares were down 0.1% in the stock market today. American and United Airlines (UAL) rose 0.3%, but gave up most of their early gains. Cruise lines Carnival (CCL) lost 0.7% and Royal Caribbean (RCL) dipped 0.5%.

Hotel and travel stocks have been big winners in recent months.Estimates: Earnings per share of 91 cents, up 5%. Revenue should surge 40% to $5.286 billion, fueled by Marriott's acquisition of Starwood Hotels & Resorts last year.Results: EPS of $1.01 on revenue of $5.561 billion. Revenue per available room rose 3.1% in North America and worldwide in constant currency.Outlook: Marriott sees revPAR up 1%-3% worldwide in Q2 in constant currency, including a 0-2% gain in North America and 3%-5% in the rest of the world.

Priceline rose 26 cents to 1903.91, hitting a record intraday high. Both Marriott and Priceline headed into earnings with best-possible 99 Composite Ratings, which means they are outperforming 99% of all other stocks on a variety of fundamental and technical factors. While you should never buy a stock on ratings alone winning stocks in history often have a 95+ CR near the start of their runs.More hotel-friendly policies and a more optimistic consumer could extend the cycle for the hotel industry, currently in its eighth year. Cycles tend to last seven to nine years, Morningstar analyst Dan Wasiolek said.Revenue per available room, an important industry metric, had likely peaked in 2015 but could stay positive this year and next. Still, the growth of hotels' supply of rooms has been limited in recent years. Many hotels have been reluctant to expand lodging since the recession, and creditors have been hesitant to extend credit.IBD'S TAKE: As President Trump's administration considers tougher vetting measures to people traveling to the U.S. and slaps electronics restrictions on some U.S.-bound flights, Gulf carriers have pulled back on flying to the U.S.As the current cycle enters its later stages, Wasiolek said he would be on the lookout for any Q1 commentary from Marriott around the strength of leisure travel, which tends to pick up first when sentiment turns around, followed by corporate demand and conventions.But Marriott has been doing many other things right as well, Wasiolek said, things that were perhaps punctuated by its Starwood acquisition.The company has done a nice job offering ""select-service"" lodging, he said. That is, hotels that offer a room, and maybe a bar, that appeal to millennials who would rather spend more time exploring the surrounding territory than being pampered in a full-service resort.Marriott also has hefty exposure to the U.S. and among the biggest loyalty programs in the business, Wasiolek added. That program has the potential attract not just travelers but smaller, third-party hotel operators looking to enter the Marriott fold through licensing or other agreements to expand their reach.""It's probably just the fact that maybe people are coming to realize that Marriott, with the acquisition of Starwood, was already a well-positioned company. Now it's even more so,"" Wasiolek said.Marriott management has said the Trump administration's attempted travel restrictions, which have targeted a handful of largely Muslim nations, have hurt demand. But the financial impact, at least, could be minimal, or offset by in the U.S. tax cuts and better consumer confidence, Wasiolek said.And if nothing else, the political rallies that have taken place since President Trump's election could also be good for the hotel business.In a research note last week, Instinet analyst Harry Curtis said business had picked up in the first quarter in part due to ""better-than-anticipated demand level surrounding the inauguration of President Trump, political rallies in D.C., and the Easter holiday shift.""The American Hotel & Lodging Association, whose members include Marriott, Hilton and Hyatt, reportedly plans a public relations and lobbying push criticizing Priceline and Expedia (EXPE), accusing them of monopolistic behavior.RELATED:Delta Says It Handles Overbookings Better Than Rivals; Outlook StrongThis Kind Of Airline Competition Is Hitting Buffett's Portfolio

51,HLT,"No. 3 online travel agency Expedia (EXPE) is partnering with Washington-based Red Lion Hotels (RLH), but larger chains like Hilton Worldwide (HLT) and Marriott International (MAR) are still guarding their discounted rates.Expedia stock rose 0.3% to close at 112.25 on the stock market today, a day after it announced Red Lion would extend its discounted rates to Expedia customers. Red Lion stock fell 0.45% to6.83.The deal requires Expedia customers to sign up for Red Lion's rewards program and agree to receive Red Lion marketing emails. Cowen analyst Kevin Kopelman calls the move a departure from Expedia's typical practice of withholding customer emails.The arrangement ""may be considered a major benefit by other hotels looking to boost loyalty program enrollment and direct email marketing lists,"" Kopelman wrote in a research report. ""Expedia noted it is in 'deep discussions' with 'a lot of other chains' about member rates.""But the Red Lion deal is technically a test and Expedia could decide to shutter the program. Red Lion is also a smaller chain and has typically supported online travel agencies (OTAs) as marketing partners.IBD'S TAKE: Expedia subsidiaries HomeAway and Trivago are each expected to reach $1 billion in sales next year. Meanwhile, Expedia says it's considering filing an initial public offering for Trivago.Larger chains like Hilton and Marriott have been steadily chipping away at discounts offered by Expedia, Priceline (PCLN) and TripAdvisor (TRIP) by offering steeper discounts to customers who book directly with the hotel. This allows the hotel to avoid paying OTA fees.Kopelman estimates about half of Expedia's business stems from the hotel chains, while TripAdvisor and Priceline are 40% and 15% exposed, respectively. He reiterated his outperform rating and 135 price target on Expedia stock, which is down 10% in 2016.In related news, TripAdvisor announced Thursday it had acquired New York-based Citymaps, a social mapping platform that helps tourists ""uncover hidden gems and hot spots."" The terms of the acquisition were not disclosed.TripAdvisor stock eased less than 0.1% to 61.90 Thursday.

52,HLT,"Expedia (EXPE) subsidiaries HomeAway and Trivago will each reach $1 billion in sales next year, Cowen analyst Kevin Kopelman predicted Friday after the online travel agency's mixed Q2 earnings report late Thursday.But that will follow share loss to No. 1 rival Priceline (PCLN) and hotel chains like Marriott International (MAR) and Hilton Worldwide (HLT), he said. Euromonitor analysts said this week that Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google and TripAdvisor (TRIP) are pressuring online travel agencies.By the closing bell on the stock market today, Expedia stock fell 2.2% to 116.65. Shares are down 6% for the year, as IBD's 10-company Leisure Booking-Travel has risen 3%. On Friday, the travel stocks were up, with Priceline climbing nearly 2% to 1350.81. TripAdvisor lost 1.8% to 69.97.IBD'S TAKE: Priceline tops IBD's 10-company Leisure Booking-Travel industry group, but the group itself is only ranked No. 106 out of 197 groups tracked. Priceline stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 89, meaning it performs in the top 10% of stocks in terms of key metrics.For Q2, Expedia reported $2.1 billion in sales and 83 cents earnings per share ex items, up 32% and 7%, respectively, vs. last year. Sales missed analysts' view for $2.25 billion, but EPS beat the 78 cent expectation.Adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) came in at $330.9 million, topping the consensus for $294.5 million, Credit Suisse analyst Stephen Ju wrote in a research report.HomeAway contributed $35 million to EBITDA, topping models by Kopelman and the consensus for $3 million and $17 million, respectively. HomeAway revenue accelerated 36% to $172 million on its new online booking commission fee model.But overall organic room night growth slowed to 12% year over year, from 24% in Q1. Kopelman noted headwinds including Orbitz's integration following its $1.3 billion acquisition last September, as well as share losses to Priceline and traditional hotels, and a weaker macroeconomy.Online travel has steadily improved since bottoming in 2009, Benchmark analyst Daniel Kurnos wrote in a report, but he says an uptick in terror attacks is likely to weight in the near term. Still, Expedia's international and domestic gross bookings increased a respective 16% and 31% in Q2.Expedia reiterated its full-year EBITDA model for 35%-45% growth. The company said the year will include greater contributions from HomeAway and Orbitz, which are already ahead of earlier guidance for $275 million to $325 million, Cowen's Kopelman said.That effectively lowered Expedia's core EBITDA expectations from 8%-13% growth, he wrote. And if room nights don't modestly accelerate in the second half of 2016, EBITDA will wrap the year close to the lower end of guidance.Kopelman lowered his 2016 EBITDA expectation to $1.635 billion, but he boosted his price target on Expedia stock to 135 from 130. He has an outperform rating on shares and in a research report highlighted bright spots like HomeAway's ""blowout quarter"" and a potential Trivago initial public offering.

53,HLT,"Hotel chains like Hilton Worldwide (HLT) and Marriott International (MAR) likely hurt No. 3 online travel agency Expedia (EXPE) during Q2, Cowen analyst Kevin Kopelman said Tuesday. But Wall Street consensus expectations are for double-digit sales growth.At the close on the stock market today, Expedia shares shaved off 3 cents to 117.64. The shares are down 5% this year, while IBD's 10-company Leisure-Travel Booking industry group is up 2%. The group ranks a low No. 117 out of 197 groups tracked.IBD'S TAKE: None of the 10 companies in the Leisure-Travel Booking industry group is rated very highly. No. 1 online travel agency Priceline leads the group with an IBD Composite Rating of 87, meaning it performs in the top 15% of all stocks in key metrics. Get Priceline's Stock Checkup.In June, hotel chains upped their assault on Priceline (PCLN), Expedia and TripAdvisor (TRIP), offering ""member rates"" that undercut online travel agencies by 2%-20% in an effort to avoid 10%-15% online travel agency (OTA) fees, Kopelman said in a research report. He models 18% organic room-night growth vs. last year.That would decelerate from 24% growth in Q1, which enjoyed Easter Weekend and Leap Day tailwinds, Kopelman wrote.Priceline is the No. 1 OTA by market valuation, with China's Ctrip (CTRP) No. 2.For Q2, the consensus of 27 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters models Expedia to post $2.25 billion in sales, up 35% year over year, and 78 cents earnings per share ex items, down 12%. But analysts project a return to EPS growth in Q3.That's vastly too high, according to marketing analysis firm Jumpshot. Based on historical bookings trends and Jumpshot's tracking of 160 billion user clicks monthly, the firm predicts Expedia's Q2 sales coming in at $1.9 billion, up 26%.

54,HLT,"Delta Air Lines (DAL), Carnival (CCL), Expedia (EXPE) and other travel-related stocks plunged early Friday after a suspected terror attack left more than 80 people dead in southern France, but many pared losses.Delta shares fell 2.4% to 39.98 in the stock market today. The airline has the most exposure to France of any U.S. airline. American Airlines (AAL) stock erased losses and turned up 1 cent. United Continental (UAL) was off just 0.9%. All three carriers are up sharply for the week.Hilton Worldwide (HLT) shares rose 0.3%. Marriott (MAR) dipped 0.35% and Hyatt Hotels (H) turned up 0.3%.Travel booking site Expedia shares edged down 0.4%. Priceline (PCLN) shares fell 1.2%.Among cruise lines, Carnival fell 2.2%, Norwegian Cruise Line (NCLH) 3.7% and Royal Caribbean Cruises (RCL) 2.1%.IBD'S TAKE: Most industry groups in the travel and leisure sector are well off highs, but have mounted a rebound of late. Airlines are back up to early June levels after dipping for much of the last month. Hotels recovered to March levels after a four-month drought. The travel booking sector that includes Priceline and Expedia is back up after a brief, Brexit-inspired sell-off. And cruise lines recently broke out to reach prices not seen since December.The attack in Nice happened late Thursday night as revelers were at a parade celebrating France's Bastille Day. A truck, reportedly filled with weapons and explosives, slammed into the crowd killing at least 84 people and wounding 100 others.The suspected terror attack comes eight months after gunmen opened fire at a Paris nightclub and cafes frequented by tourists.But, like prior attacks, the incident in Nice is unlikely to have long term effects on travel.In an prior interview with IBD, Jack Plunkett, CEO of global market research firm Plunkett Research, said that airlines were busy again within a few weeks after the 9/11 terror attacks and the same was true after the 2002 nightclub bombing in Bali, Indonesia, and the transit bombings in Madrid in 2004 and London in 2005.
"
55,HLT,"Hotel chains such as Hilton Worldwide (HLT) and Marriott International (MAR) are chipping away at discounts offered by online travel agencies (OTAs) Priceline (PCLN), Expedia (EXPE) and TripAdvisor (TRIP), Cowen analyst Kevin Kopelman said Tuesday.No. 1 OTA Priceline is least exposed, with only 10%-15% of its business stemming from the U.S., where the online donnybrook is mushrooming. Half of TripAdvisor's and 52% of Expedia's sales are tied to the U.S., he said.""These (hotel chain direct) discounts are in addition to loyalty program points and other offers/benefits being provided to customers only when they book direct with the hotel,"" Kopelman wrote in a research report.Direct discounts range between 2% and 20% cheaper than booking with OTAs, Kopelman wrote. He estimates 50% and 40% of Expedia and TripAdviser's sales are exposed to hotel chains. Only about 15% of Priceline is exposed.Importantly, he said, the direct-booking trend threatens to undo the reputations of OTAs like Priceline and Expedia which offer ""Best Price Guarantees"" that don't appear to cover the new ""member rates"" by hotel chains.""If the chains are successful in getting the message out that their own sites carry cheaper rates, they may be able to train customers to check the hotel website first before booking, decreasing OTA conversion rates,"" he wrote.But consumers largely aren't loyal to specific hotel chains, and most hotel chains have yet to buy in on the direct-booking game, Kopelman wrote. Plus, Expedia has a series of popular loyalty programs.On the stock market today, Priceline erased small losses to close up 0.6% at 1275.03. Expedia stock closed down 1.65% to 105.93. TripAdvisor stock dipped 0.5% to 64.30.Hilton shares lost 2.2% while Marriott fell 1%.
"
56,HLT,"Qunar's (QUNR) ongoing dispute with China's airlines won't hurt China's No. 1 online travel agent Ctrip.com (CTRP), which is expected to report March-quarter travel sales that doubled vs. last year, ITG analyst Henry Guo said.Ctrip and Qunar stocks split on the stock market today, with shares of Ctrip 1.7%, as Qunar fell 1.5%. IBD's 11-company Leisure-Travel Booking industry group was up a fraction.For Q1, Guo expects Ctrip to report 4.19 billion to 4.29 billion yuan ($640 million to $650 million), topping the consensus view for 4.16 billion yuan. Ctrip hasn't yet set a date for its Q1 earnings release.That outperformance would follow a months-long battle with flagship carrier Air China -- along with some other local airlines including Hainan Airlines and its Hong Kong Airlines unit, as well as China Eastern's Shanghai Airlines -- over fees charged by booking agents such as Qunar.Ctrip acquired a stake in Qunar after the two formed a partnership last year. In the wake of airlines' refusal to list on Qunar.com, the site now directs users to Ctrip.com or to airlines' official websites, Guo wrote in a research note.""We believe this should help drive Ctrip's organic transportation revenue growth and partially offset Qunar's air-ticketing weakness,"" he wrote.Hotel occupancy in China fell to 53.1% in Q1 from 53.6% in the prior quarter, Guo said, but revenue per available room surged 2.2% year over year, ""suggesting improved monetization for the whole hotel industry.""At the same time, he says InterContinental Hotels Group (IHG) and Hilton Worldwide (HLT) reported 8.3% and 8% year-over-year growth for their Chinese operations, respectively, and Marriott International (MAR) saw revenue per available room in Asia rise 6.8% vs. last year.Guo expects Ctrip to report a 76% to 86% jump in accommodations sales vs. the year-earlier quarter, topping the company's guidance for 70%-80% growth. He sees Ctrip's travel segment more than doubling revenue.Packaged tours -- one of Ctrip's growth engines -- has benefited from outbound travel to high-demand destinations like Japan, South Korea and Southeast Asia, Guo wrote. Relaxed visa requirements have helped fuel outbound travel. He expects 52% year-over-year growth in this segment.

57,HLT,"A bevy of analysts hiked price targets for tech bellwethers Salesforce.com (CRM) and Cisco Systems (CSCO), while defense giants Northrop Grumman (NOC) and Lockheed Martin (LMT) were downgraded.Networking gear giant Cisco's positive earnings news late Wednesday earned it price-target hikes from Wunderlich, to 27 from 24, though the research firm still has a hold rating. RBC, with an outperform rating for Cisco, raised its target to 33 from 31.Cisco shares closed up 3.2% Thursday.Salesforce shares finished 4% higher on the heels of positive earnings news, with numerous analysts chiming in with price-target hikes.Mizuho and Stifel, which both have buy ratings on the provider of customer relationship management software via the cloud, raised their targets to 100 from 90 and to 93 from 85, respectively.IBD's Take: How healthy are the shares of Salesforce and its rivals?

58,HLT,"Covington, Ky., a city of 40,000 across the Ohio River from Cincinnati, seems like an odd place for a high-end hotel. For Mario Tricoci, that's a selling point.Last year, the Chicago developer hooked up with a local real estate investor on a $22 million retrofit of a century-old, seven-story, defunct Covington department store that locals say was the first skyscraper in Kentucky made of reinforced concrete.Tricoci, chief executive officer of Aparium Hotel Group, is in the middle of a small-market spree that started with the conversions of a Milwaukee warehouse in 2013 and a La Crosse, Wisc., chocolate factory in 2015. Aparium has hotels taking shape in a former warehouse for tractors and other farm equipment in Minneapolis, an old fire department headquarters in Detroit, and an obsolete bottling plant for Pabst Brewing in Kansas City, Mo. By the time he's done, Tricoci said, the company could be operating 20 hotels or more, with a focus on small cities that are nonetheless big enough to have a pro sports team.The idea is to grab hold of two dovetailing trends: consumers shying away from branded offerings and investors putting money into smaller U.S. cities, encouraged by local economic development types and a diverse set of national cheerleaders. They include AOL co-founder Steve Case, who has been banging the drum for technology startups in minor markets, and commercial real estate firms touting ""18-hour cities,"" on the theory that traditional markets such as New York and San Francisco have become too expensive.“Coming out of the recession, it felt like a safer environment to play in,” said Tricoci, 44, whose previous company built the Elysian Hotel in Chicago, a five-star offering that opened in 2009 and was later rebranded as a Hilton Worldwide Holdings (HLT)-owned Waldorf Astoria.While the room rates are cheaper -- Tricoci estimates that a $200 suite at his Charmant Hotel in La Crosse would go for $700 a night in New York -- the dearth of competition has helped keep Aparium's early properties busy.“Every one of these markets has wealthy people who eat and drink and spend money,” he said. “They have major businesses with spending accounts and stipends.”Aparium isn't the first hotel operator lured to the rehab business by the prospect of cheap buildings with good bones. The Ritz-Carlton Philadelphia sits in a domed Beaux Arts building that was put up as a bank headquarters. The Renaissance Pittsburgh Hotel, a Marriott International (MAR) property, occupies a 1906 building commissioned by Henry Phipps, a partner in Carnegie Steel. Kimpton Hotels has a line, called Hotel Monaco, dedicated to the adaptive reuse of historic buildings. Drury Hotels has put beds in an old fur-trading building in St. Louis and a former education department building in Cleveland.The list goes on. Over the last decade, the boutique chain 21c Museum Hotels has refurbished historic buildings in Louisville, Ky.; Lexington, Ky.; Cincinnati and Durham, N.C., and is currently converting an Oklahoma City building whose original purpose was as an assembly plant for the Ford Model T. The company is working on historic projects in Nashville, Tenn.; Indianapolis, and Kansas City, where it will soon be competing with adaptive reuse projects flying the flags of Holiday Inn Express, Hampton Inn and Embassy Suites.""More developers have started to leverage adaptive reuse over the past three years, and we've seen some really creative conversions across the U.S., often from vacant or underutilized office buildings to full-service, lifestyle and select-service hotels,"" said Lauro Ferroni, senior vice president at JLL’s[JLL] Hotels & Hospitality Group in the U.S. ""We expect this trend to continue, across both primary and secondary markets, as these are often the types of deals where developers make the best returns.""The trend toward adaptive reuse started in earnest when consumers began to tire of the cookie-cutter hotels popular in the 1980s and 1990s, said Jan Freitag, a senior vice president at the hotel data firm STR Global. There are more than 150,000 hotel rooms currently under construction in the U.S., up from a low of about 80,000 in 2009, just after the financial crisis. Using old buildings helps developers differentiate their products in a bustling market, and it may help hotels entice travelers increasingly lured to the more idiosyncratic experience of booking a room on Airbnb.Developers willing to meet the building standards of the National Park Service can qualify for Historic Rehabilitation Tax Credits, which cover 20% of the rehab costs. Builders won preliminary approval for $6.6 billion of those tax credits in 2015, a total that covers residential and commercial projects. States commonly offer additional tax credits for historic rehabilitation.“These days there’s a demand for differentiation, where hotels want to be unique and have personalities,” said David Schon, a Washington-based partner at the law firm Nixon Peabody who advises clients seeking tax credits for fixing up old buildings. “When hotels want to locate downtown in centers of cities, they tend to be old buildings with interesting architecture.""For the Embassy Suites project in Kansas City, another Hilton property, a developer is planning to spend $149 million spiffing up a former Federal Reserve Bank building. There, you'll be able to relax in ornate splendor amid the ghosts of central bankers. Surely that has its charms, if not an infinity pool.Related:Affordable-Housing Crunch Moves Inland To Modest-Sized U.S. CitiesHot Housing Market Spreading To America’s HeartlandWhy Some Top U.S. Airports Are Getting Luxury Hotels

59,HLT,"In what could be the first of many such moves in the hotel industry, Hilton Worldwide Holdings (HLT) on Friday said it will spin off most of its real estate business into a publicly traded real estate investment trust (REIT) and will also split off its timeshare business, Hilton Grand Vacations, into a separate, publicly traded company.The spin-offs are designed to increase shareholder value at Hilton, which owns brands such as Waldorf Astoria and Embassy Suites. The moves not only should increase Hilton’s combined market value, analysts say. They also would reduce the amount of capital Hilton has to pour into its non-hotel businesses.The upshot is that Hilton Worldwide can focus solely on managing its hotels business, hoping it will help it better compete against direct rivals such as Marriott International (MAR), Starwood Hotels & Resorts (HOT) and Wyndham Worldwide (WYN), as well as online travel sites like Priceline Group (PCLN), Expedia (EXPE) and Airbnb.“The transactions we announced today will result in three pure-play companies, enabling dedicated management teams to fully activate their respective businesses, taking advantage of both organic and inorganic growth opportunities as well as capital market and tax efficiencies,” Chief Executive Christopher Nassetta said in a prepared statement. “We intend to have the appropriate leadership, strategies and capital structures in place to set up all three companies for further success.”Hilton Worldwide’s newly formed real estate company will include around 70 properties and 35,000 rooms, the company said, while the timeshare business will manage nearly 50 club resorts in the U.S. and Europe. If the spin-offs pay off for Hilton, other hotel companies with a diverse range of assets, including Marriott and Starwood, might feel pressure to follow suit.Meanwhile, Hilton also reported fourth-quarter results on Friday. Adjusted earnings came in at 22 cents a share, up 22% from the prior year and in line with the consensus of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. Revenue climbed 1% to $2.86 billion, below views for $2.96 billion.Shares of Hilton closed up 2.5% on the stock market today. Marriott’s dipped 0.2%, while Starwood added 0.4% and Wyndham increased 1.3%.Shares of Priceline lost 0.7%, while Expedia stock gained 0.3%.Image provided by Shutterstock.

60,HLT,"If there's one thing Rick Simonson wants to make clear, it's that Sabre (SABR) is not a travel company.""Our customers are travel companies,"" Sabre's chief financial officer said in an interview with IBD. ""We're the technology provider to the travel industry.""Even so, Texas-based Sabre has been doing a lot of traveling lately -- to the cloud. Sabre's business in software-as-a-service (SaaS) and its work with airlines, hotels and other travel-oriented businesses is growing faster than the firm's mainstay travel network segment, which consists largely of its global distribution system.That system provides reams of information, such as prices and inventory -- most notably on airlines -- to travel agents, online agencies like Expedia (EXPE) and other travel buyers. Hotels are a smaller but growing portion of that, thanks in part to a deal struck last year with Wyndham Worldwide (WYN), its first large-scale hotel partner.""The (global distribution system) is a more mature market,"" Morningstar analyst Dan Wasiolek told IBD, adding that it accounts for about 70% of Sabre's revenue.The other 30% of Sabre's revenue comes from its software platform, which it calls Airline and Hospitality Solutions. It provides reservation, inventory management and other software services to airlines and hotels. It's in its early stages but serves as a key growth engine, Wasiolek says.Whether old or new, however, Sabre's back-end technology essentially touches almost every step of a traveler's journey, from looking into and booking travel to boarding and checking in, whether with an airline or hotel. And on the operations side, its software helps airlines manage crews and tasks such as monitoring fuel levels, cargo weight and routing. For hotels, its software can manage bookings and come up with optimal room prices based on demand and other factors.Sabre expects its tech solutions business to top $1 billion in revenue this year, up more than 17% over last year. That compares with 5% to 6% growth expected in its core so-called travel network business, excluding revenue from last year's acquisition of Singapore-based Abacus International, a business-to-business e-commerce travel company focused on the Asia-Pacific market.Sabre bought the remaining 65% interest in Abacus it didn't already own. With Abacus included, management thinks travel-network revenue will grow 13.5% to 14.5% this year.""We will approach $3.5 billion in (total) revenue, which makes us one of the bigger software companies in the world,"" Simonson said, adding that margins and cash flow also are increasing. Revenue in 2015 rose 12.5% to $2.96 billion.After growing 17% in 2015, per-share earnings are seen increasing by 32% this year to $1.45 a share, according to a poll of analysts by Thomson Reuters.  Earnings are expected to grow 18% next year.""Sabre continues to evolve from a slower-growing travel distribution business to a technology-driven SaaS company, providing cloud-based solutions to travel suppliers,"" wrote analyst Mark Moerdler of Bernstein in a client note. He sees Sabre's SaaS business growing in the mid teens vs. single-digit growth for its global distribution system.Sabre is best known for its global distribution system, one of the two largest in the world along with chief rival Amadeus, based in Spain and big in Europe. A third, smaller player is U.K.-based Travelport Worldwide (TVPT). Many airlines use more than one global distribution system, and it's usually Amadeus and Sabre, and to a lesser extent Travelport.Airlines pay Sabre a modest flat fee for every air ticket booked, so traffic counts more than price. A portion of the fee is paid to a travel agency as an incentive for using its global distribution system.""The net fee we keep is our gross profit,"" Simonson said.Sabre is riding a growing air passenger market. Global air traffic grew 7.8% in the first two months of 2016 from a year earlier, according to the International Air Transport Association, or IATA. It was the strongest start to a year since 2008, IATA said.Simonson says that Sabre has more than 400 airline clients, covering most of the globe. Some of its newest airline customers include Italy's Alitalia, Air Berlin, Panama-based Copa Holdings (CPA) and Brazil's TAM Airlines (owned by LATAM Airlines (LFL)).Last year, Sabre completed what it says was the largest airline reservations system integration and upgrade in the airline industry, for client American Airlines (AAL), following its merger with U.S. Airways. The chief executive of American said the work was ""flawless,"" Simonson said.On the software solutions side of the business, Sabre gets a set fee for providing software and data for handling functions involved in getting passengers on board a plane. It also gets a fee for every person ""boarded"" in a hotel room, plus additional fees for providing other operational hotel services, such as digital marketing and property management.In Wyndham, Sabre landed what Simonson described as the ""largest hotelier in the world"" as a partner. The win last year was ""huge,"" he said. Sabre is currently rolling out a central reservation system across 7,600 Wyndham properties worldwide.Earlier, Sabre announced it would handle central reservations for the privately held Four Seasons Hotels.Most hotels, including big chains such as Hilton (HLT) and Marriott (MAR), still handle such work in-house. Sabre's hotel business had previously focused on smaller, independent hotels around the world.The company's hospitality solutions business serves around 32,000 hotel properties, including hotels gained from its acquisition in January of Trust Group, a central reservation, revenue management and hotel marketing firm with a presence in Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Asia-Pacific.But it's the Wyndham win that's especially key to landing other large-scale hotels that may be inclined to follow suit and also outsource work to third-party experts such as Sabre, Simonson says.Analysts agree.""The (hospitality solutions) business has significant runway, and we expect the accelerated pace to sustain with Wyndham as an anchor client,"" wrote Ashish Sabadra in a recent report for Deutsche Bank Securities.

117,HLT,"Airbnb is a fast-emerging travel accommodations disrupter valued at $25 billion — but it had a humble beginning. When co-founders Brian Chesky and Joe Gebbia couldn't pay their San Francisco rent, they bought three air mattresses and launched a website to rent each mattress for $80 a night. When they found takers, the proverbial light bulb went off.The company runs a website where traveler ""hosts"" rent their homes and apartments — or rooms in their homes and apartments — to travelers for short stays of usually a month or less. Airbnb generated Q3 revenue of $340 million on bookings of $2.2 billion, according to a presentation to investors leaked to the Wall Street Journal.The company is losing some $150 million a year, reported the WSJ, but it's also nipping at the heals of online travel agencies (OTAs) such as Expedia (EXPE) and Priceline (PCLN), upending hotel chains such as Hilton (HLT) and Marriott (MAR) and helping establish a regulatory beachhead in the 34,000 cities where it boasts listings, which could also help rivals such as HomeAway (AWAY).""The online travel agencies and (Priceline's) Bookings.com in particular have said they are happy to let Airbnb blaze the (regulatory) trail and bear a lot of those costs,"" Douglas Quinby, an analyst with online travel research firm Phocuswright, told IBD. ""The big OTAs see opportunities, but they would prefer to let Airbnb drive the regulations.""Airbnb's staunchly Democratic home city of San Francisco has been a battlefield for crafting regulations for Airbnb and similar businesses. Those regulations include requiring such firms to pay hotel taxes and limiting how long hosts can rent out their homes or apartments.Critics have hammered on the company's strategy of begging for forgivingness vs. asking for permission, meaning they start up operations in a city and only respond to concerns as they surface.But the company notched a big win in a November election, when San Francisco voters resoundingly rejected Proposition F, a restrictive measure that, among other provisions, would force Airbnb to provide a quarterly report saying how many days hosts had listed their properties for rent. Prop F would have limited that 75 days a year, and make violations a misdemeanor.After the dust settled, with Airbnb spending $8 million to defeat the item, the question remains: What does the vote mean for Airbnb and the travel industry?""On the one hand, it's an important win in a key market — the birthplace of Airbnb,"" Quinby said. ""On the other hand, it's kind of meaningless because regulations are all being decided on a local level. And there's no reason to think that because San Francisco does one thing, someone else wouldn't do another.""OTAs Say Impact 'Immaterial'On Oct. 29, Expedia CEO Dara Khosrowshaki brushed off Airbnb's impact on his company, speaking on Expedia's earnings conference call. Less than a week later, Expedia announced an agreement to acquire the closest thing Airbnb has to a competitor in public markets: HomeAway. Unlike Airbnb, HomeAway's focus is more tightly centered around renting out entire homes for long vacations. HomeAway, founded in 2005, is valued near $3.48 billion and is expected to end the year with revenue of $500 million. But unlike Airbnb, HomeAway makes money. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters estimate it will end 2015 with an operating profit of $102.5 million.Expedia decline to comment for this story.""It's disingenuous to say that (Airbnb is) not having an impact,"" T. Rowe Price (TROW) portfolio manager Joe Fath told IBD. ""I tend to pay attention to what companies do, instead of what they say.""Fath manages T. Rowe Price's Growth Stock Fund .The fund bought private stock in Airbnb more than two years ago and has hiked its stake's value some 150% since then. Fath is looking for a ""home run"" from Airbnb. ""Supply is Airbnb's biggest constraint,"" he said.Analyst Quinby agrees.""Without question Airbnb has been a phenomenon in the travel industry over the last several years,"" he said. ""They've created an entirely new category in the travel industry. In 2011, 10% of U.S. travelers stayed in private accommodations. In 2014, that number was up to 25%.""For a second straight year, an RBC Capital Markets survey found that one-third of respondents said they have used some form of alternative accommodations, such as Airbnb or HomeAway subsidiary VRBO.One of Fath's largest holdings is Priceline, which he acknowledged hasn't been performing that well in the last 12 months. But he expects the stock will perform better.Also, Priceline is ""well hedged"" against Airbnb and similar firms because of its growing inventory of alternative lodgings, says RBC analyst Mark Mahaney. In a recent research note, he said Priceline's inventory of 361,000 properties is up 80% over the past year.Hyper-Local Regulations BattleThe regulations fight for short-term rentals is hyper local. The hotels and short-term rentals field isn't regulated federally and there are few state laws, so companies must work with each municipality. But while the impact of the San Francisco vote was geographically limited, it was closely watched because of the precedent it would set.Airbnb ""needed to fight this because ... if Proposition F passed, it would have stymied their ability to do business,"" Ed Zitron, an SF-based tech public relations executive uninvolved in the Prop F election, told IBD. ""A defeat would have ... scared investors.""The Airbnb win was a loss for the hotel industry, which led the fight to pass the measure. Still, the benefit of Prop F is that a lot of issues got aired ""in a public forum,"" Troy Flanagan, vice president of state and local affairs for the American Hotel and Lodging Association, told IBD. ""This is one of the first times, if not the first time, such a comprehensive proposal for online, modern short-term rentals was floated. It was a public, open debate in the hometown of Airbnb.""People renting out multiple units are hoteliers, but they aren't being held to the same standards (as hoteliers).""Airbnb, in fact, says it currently collects taxes only in 24 cities in two states, according to a spokesman.When IBD asked Airbnb what the stakes were in the Prop F vote, company spokesman Christopher Nulty wrote in an email that ""Proposition F was a hotel-funded campaign attempting to scare San Franciscans into believing this measure would do a single thing to address affordability in San Francisco. We remain committed to working with policymakers across the country and around the globe to develop smart, common sense regulations that allow regular people to share their homes while contributing to their communities.""Airbnb declined to make any executive available for this story. But CEO Chesky told Re/Code that losing the S.F. vote would have hurt. ""... You can win 10 cities in Europe but you lose your home city and it basically just seems like you're losing ground completely,"" Re/Code quoted Chesky saying. ""We have 130,000 members (hosts and guests) in San Francisco. They ended up winning the ballot, not us. I used to say they're on the ballot, not us. Because we're going to be in 33,999 cities and they're the ones really at stake here, for us it's more of a brand issue.""Affordable housing is a huge issue in San Francisco and the greater Bay Area amid skyrocketing rents and home prices, so renting out a room can help a homeowner.HomeAway says its preferred tactic is to train property owners and managers to lobby their city governments, rather than get embroiled in a Prop F-type election.""That's our traditional path,"" Matt Curtis, HomeAway's director of government relations, told IBD. ""We don't do campaign donations.""Curtis agrees with Airbnb that Prop F was too restrictive, and he says HomeAway wants to ensure ""fair and effective"" regulations in cities where the company operates.""Communities that have chosen to make burdensome restrictions have driven short-term rental activity underground,"" Curtis said. So, those businesses are ""not paying taxes, operating outside the existing framework.""

118,HLT,"The recent share price action is nothing to write home about, but the fundamentals are striking for real estate investment trust Hersha Hospitality (HT) .The Philadelphia-based REIT owns 53 upscale and mid-scale hotels with 8,508 rooms in big cities such as New York, Boston, Philadelphia, Washington, D.C., Miami, Los Angeles and others. Its hotel brands include Hilton (HLT), Marriott (MAR), Hyatt (H), and Starwood's (HOT) Sheraton, and they are geared toward corporate and leisure travelers.The stock attempted to carve out a saucer base, but failed during the summer and remains in a downtrend. The Relative Strength rating is in the low 30s, and the Accumulation/Distribution Rating is a worst possible E, showing that the big investors are sellers.But funds from operation, the REIT equivalent of earnings, along with revenue, have been growing. In the most recent quarter, FFO rose 24% from a year earlier, and revenue rose 10%, with analysts forecasting 15% growth in 2016.Dividend growth has also impressed. After several years of quarterly dividends of 6 cents a share, Hersha raised the payout to 7 cents in 2014, then to 28 cents earlier this year, equal to a 5% annualized dividend yield.Wells Fargo analysts said in November the company is in talks to sell some of its New York and suburban properties. Any proceeds would be used to buy back shares or purchase more hotels.On Dec. 1, Janney Montgomery Scott analysts started coverage at neutral. They said the company is well-run, but they worry about industry factors and the fact the company is highly focused with 71% of earnings coming from New York, Miami and California. There's a danger, they said, of rising supply, poor performance, lagging international travel, loss of pricing power and the proliferation of Airbnb.

119,HLT,"Scan the lodging options around most big U.S. airports, and you'll find an abundance of humble accommodations — along with a few best described as frightening. The tony hotels are typically found in city centers, where business travelers, tourists, and conventioneers tend to congregate.
"
120,HLT,"The post-recession U.S. hotel boom is changing that, with upscale airport hotels now planned in Minneapolis-St. Paul, New York City and Atlanta, as well as a 500-room Westin which opened Thursday at Denver International Airport.Given the generally higher costs for a full-service hotel such as a W or Hilton, these projects haven't traditionally mixed with airport traffic that comes and leaves quickly, often because of weather-marred flights. But two travel trends are converging to change that math.Commercial real estate developers are seeing airports as fertile locations, driven by rising demand for rooms and conference space. And U.S. airports are upgrading their facilities to appeal to a more sophisticated clientele, the kind who want such amenities as spas, trendy bistros, and even yoga spaces.""Passengers in general have increased their expectations of airports,"" said Kim Day, chief executive officer of Denver International. ""They want higher-end shopping, better food, and they want better places to stay when they stay.""That also means a stroll to the hotel lobby from the terminal — no shuttles — along with cutting-edge design, full-service spas, chic bars and upscale restaurants.This new breed of airport hotel also affords ample space for business meetings, given that many companies like the idea of flying employees to a central point near (or in) an airport and getting down to business without the hassles of transit. And with occupancy rates near record levels for most full-service hotels, it's harder for a business group to find room at the inn, which changes the economics of putting a full-service property at or near an airport.Introducing The 'Travel Plaza'Room demand at airport locations has grown from an average of 55 million room nights in 2010 to 65 million today, according to STR, a lodging data and research firm. Average room rates at airport locations have also increased, in line with the overall industry, and now top $110 per night. ""The occupancies are so high now some players are saying wait a second, maybe this is a place we should look,"" said Jan Freitag, an STR senior vice president.The Denver hotel, which has endured a history of fits and starts since the airport's 1995 opening, is designed as a destination for business travelers to meet and a way to bridge the airport with central Denver, which sits nearly 30 miles to the west. In April, a new light rail train will connect the Westin and airport with downtown via a $9 ride that's 37 minutes. Day predicts that line will help make the hotel a destination for weddings and other events.This summer, officials at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International sought bidders for a 300-room, ""top-tier"" four-star hotel to be built as part of a ""travel plaza"" that would have office space, a gas station and possibly residential units. Atlanta vies with Chicago's O'Hare as the world's busiest airport hub but has no hotel connected to a terminal, as airports such as those at Detroit, Tampa and Huntsville, Ala., offer.From Backstop To Better Product""In the 1960s and '70s, airport hotels were for distressed passengers"" grounded by bad weather or a broken airplane, said Tyler Morse, chief executive of MCR Development, which is building a 505-room hotel in the former TWA Flight Center at JFK International Airport. JetBlue Airways (JBLU) is a minority owner of the project, which will be connected to the airline's Terminal 5. The hotel is planned to open in the third quarter of 2018. ""They thought 'I should have this as a backstop. Let's do the bare-minimum kind of thing,'"" Morse said. ""And now people are saying, 'Hey, I can make money by having a higher-quality product.' ""Stephen Joyce, chief executive of Choice Hotels International (CHH), said the deep airline capacity cuts of the 2000s led airports to retrench as business travel waned. Hotel developers then looked elsewhere, and much of the airport lodging stock aged. Today, the airport market is ""becoming more interesting,"" Joyce said in a recent interview. ""I bet we've got 10-12 projects in and around airports"" that are under various stages of development.Mid- To High-End TravelersIn Minneapolis-St. Paul, Graves Hospitality is planning a $115 million hotel with a spa, rooftop suites, and as much as 40,000 square feet of meeting space. The 300-room property, attached to the airport's primary Terminal 1, will command rates that are 15% to 30% higher than local competing properties, at $225-$250 per night, said Benjamin Graves, president and chief executive.""The primary business is corporations that are dealing with mid- to high-end travelers that fly in, go to a meeting; they don't have to get a taxi, they don't have to figure out the market and how to get different places,"" Graves said. Graves Hospitality is negotiating with a trio of major chains — Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide (HOT), Hilton Worldwide Holdings (HLT) and InterContinental Hotel Group (IHG) — about which will brand and operate the property, which is scheduled to open in January 2018.""Go to any airport, and there's a zillion hotels within two miles,"" Morse said. ""To really do this right, you've got to be physically connected.""And at many airports, a day spa doesn't hurt either.

133,HLT,"""I've been doing this for 25 years and have never seen the kind of economics that are driving hotel revenues right now,"" said Smith, referring to the steady rise in fundamentals and lagging construction of new rooms. ""We think we're in a real sweet spot.""
"
134,HLT,"Investors think so, too. The R.W. Baird/STR Hotel Stock Index, which tracks the 15 largest publicly traded hotel companies, is up 11% year-to-date, outpacing the S&P 500 by about five percentage points.
"
135,HLT,"Three of the six largest companies by market cap in IBD's Leisure-Lodging industry group are up by double-digit percentages this year: Marriott International 30%, Intercontinental Hotels Group (IHG) 24% and Hyatt Hotels (H) 23%.
"
136,HLT,"Profits across all hotels rose an average of 10.1% in 2013, the third straight year of double-digit gains, according to PKF Consulting's research affiliate. It predicts that profits will increase more than 10% in 2014 and 2015 as average daily rates, occupancy and revenue per available room (RevPAR) — a gauge of hotel profitability — exceed pre-recession levels.
"
137,HLT,"Hendersonville, Tenn.-based STR, a research firm covering the hotel industry, reported that the average daily rate finished the week of June 14 at $115.61, a year-over-year increase of 4.4%, and that average occupancy increased 2% to 71.6% over the same period in 2013. RevPAR ended the week at $82.82, on average, a 6.5% year-over-year hike.
"
138,HLT,"Occupancy gains supported the bulk of income growth coming out of the recession, but now rising room rates are doing a more lucrative job, said Arthur Adler, Americas CEO and managing director of JLL's hotels and hospitality group.
"
139,HLT,"""Even if you have no occupancy increase, to the extent hotels can increase their room rate, the more of that increase falls to the bottom line,"" he says.
"
140,HLT,"Pipeline Growing
"
141,HLT,"Experts downplay a rising construction pipeline — at least for the near term. More than 114,300 hotel rooms were under construction at the end of the first quarter, a year-over-year jump of 40%, according to Portsmouth, N.H.-based Lodging Econometrics.
"
142,HLT,"Nearly 293,000 more rooms were in the pipeline, with some 161,700 of them slated to begin construction in the next 12 months, Lodging Econometrics said, although not all are likely to get built.
"
143,HLT,"Developers are adding most rooms in the branded upper- and mid-scale select service segments, the firm reported, which include Marriott International's (MAR) Residence Inn, Hilton Worldwide Holdings' (HLT) Hilton Garden Inn and InterContinental Hotels Group's Holiday Inn Express.
"
144,HLT,"Developers all but shut down new construction as occupancy and daily rates plummeted amid the recession. Historically the supply of new rooms typically grew 2% a year, said Lauro Ferroni, vice president, research and strategic advisory with JLL's hospitality group. But construction has fallen well short of that over the last few years — it was less than 1% in 2013, for example, and this year supply is expected to grow by 1%, he said.
"
145,HLT,"For now, Smith thinks new supply will impact the market around 2018, which should translate into continued investment activity for the foreseeable future.
"
146,HLT,"""Who knows what's going to really happen in 2018 — or tomorrow?"" he asks. A drastic change in gas or airfare prices could affect hotel performance, he acknowledged, but the fact that room demand is outstripping supply has reduced investment risk when compared with previous cycles.
"
147,HLT,"Private Equity Leads Way
"
148,HLT,"Through May this year, private equity funds such as RockBridge Capital and KSL Capital Partners completed 33% of the hotel transactions, according to JLL. RLJ Lodging Trust (RLJ), Summit Hotel Properties (INN) and other real estate investment trusts conducted 21% of the deals.
"
149,HLT,"Foreign buyers are also expressing more interest and are expected to plunk down $3 billion for hotels this year, Adler said. High-net-worth individuals and institutional investors such as life insurance companies and pension funds are pursuing lodging properties, too.
"
150,HLT,"In mid-June, however, the Charlottesville, Va.-based financial research firm SNL Financial noted that REITs had shelled out $1.2 billion for hotels in 2014, a year-over-year decrease of 11%.
"
151,HLT,"A slowdown in REIT acquisitions isn't unexpected, Adler said. The companies typically start buying at a downturn's end and then pull back later in the cycle as private equity funds that tap high amounts of debt plow into the market and push up prices.
"
152,HLT,"During the Pebblebrook Hotel Trust's (PEB) first-quarter conference call in late April, for example, company CEO Jon Bortz noted that after pursuing a successful acquisition strategy early in the cycle, the company was happy to ""cede"" the market to highly leveraged buyers. Plus, he added, fewer quality assets were hitting the market.
"
153,HLT,"The Bethesda, Md.-based owner of upscale hotels and resorts shelled out $376.3 million for 1,083 rooms in five properties over the last 18 months, according to SNL Financial data.

154,HLT,"""We've gotten to the point where existing owners look out a couple of years and say, 'Wow, it looks pretty good, why should I be in a hurry to sell if I don't need to?'"" Bortz said. ""Even in our target markets, we think values are well above what we're willing to pay based on our three- to five-year outlook.""Investors are piling into U.S. hotels, hoping to cash in on stabilized occupancy and rising room rates amid a climate of cheap debt and depressed supply. It's a mix that has generated profits for the last three years and portends more of the same for the near future.Through the end of May, hotel buyers and sellers had conducted $8.3 billion in transactions in the U.S., a year-over-year increase of $300 million, according to the Hotels & Hospitality Group of Chicago-based property broker Jones Lang LaSalle (JLL).JLL also projects that lodging sales will reach $25 billion this year, a 13.6% increase over 2013.The record-high stock market and rebounding home values have made consumers feel more confident and comfortable about taking vacations, said Arthur Adler, Americas CEO and managing director of JLL's hospitality group. On the business side, the modest economic recovery coupled with slow job growth has necessitated more travel for workers, he added.More recently, group travelers have begun to book rooms with increasing frequency, which should give the industry a further boost, say Adler and Scott Smith, senior vice president in the Atlanta office of PKF Consulting USA, an advisory and real estate firm specializing in the hospitality industry.Fundamental ReboundThe important group-bookings segment, which includes state organizations, business meeting groups and worker incentive travel programs, pulled back not only because of the slow recovery, but also as result of the negative reactions to the American International Group's (AIG) widely publicized retreat at a swanky resort soon after receiving bailout funds, Smith said.Only now is the group travel segment beginning to book rooms on par with its activity before the recession, which should give the industry a further boost, he adds.""I've been doing this for 25 years and have never seen the kind of economics that are driving hotel revenues right now,"" said Smith, referring to the steady rise in fundamentals and lagging construction of new rooms.

176,HLT,"A scuba diver swims above a reef dotted with colorful fish. An elderly couple ballroom dances on a beach at sunset. A woman sits on the edge of a rock, meditating at twilight.Then ""Diamond Resorts International (DRII): simplicity, choice, comfort,"" a voice says as the six-minute commercial on YouTube ends.Calling itself a provider of ""affordable luxury and priceless memories,"" Diamond offers vacations in 34 countries at 93 managed resorts, 154 affiliated resorts, 52 affiliated hotels and four cruise itineraries.The vacation packages are low-priced — such as five days and four nights in Cabo San Lucas for $292 or four days and three nights in Las Vegas for $92 — and are a marketing tool.The catch is that customers must be creditworthy, age 25 and older, earning at least $50,000 annually and ready to watch a one-and-a-half to two-hour sales pitch for joining Diamond's club. In the club, members buy points to use toward vacation packages.One of the costliest getaways, a nine-day European cruise on Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings' (NCLH) Norwegian Star, costs 20,000 points at peak season. Among the cheapest, a one-week stay in an Ormond Beach, Fla., studio, runs 1,200 points in low season.Funding The FunDiamond plans to increase its sales force 5%-10% annually over the next few years and boost sales to Asian customers, CEO David Palmer told IBD. About 70% of customers finance their purchase at a 15% average annual interest rate. The rate varies by the down payment, which is typically 10%.Diamond bundles customers' loans into securities and resells them to insurance companies and other institutional investors, eliminating its risk in customer defaults. About 6% of customers default on their loans; about 3.5% default on maintenance fees, said Palmer.As a ""Silver Elite"" member, Lee Huffman of Anaheim Hills, Calif., pays a $2,400 annual maintenance fee and gets 15,000 points every year in perpetuity. The finance manager of a midsize bank in Southern California and his family have used the points to stay at Diamond Resorts in California, Cabo San Lucas, Paris and Sydney.""We prefer the comfort, convenience and cost savings of timeshares over hotels even more now that we have a child,"" said Huffman. He views his timeshare as an asset in his estate that he can pass on to his 3-year-old son.As of Jan. 1, 2014, points start at $7.66 each with a minimum purchase of 2,500 points, for $19,150, according to DiamondResorts.com. Members must also pay annual maintenance fees, which vary based on their membership levels, and incidental assessment fees for renovations or large repairs.Huffman and 524,000 fellow Diamond members can be credited for fueling the company's rapid sales and earnings growth. In its third quarter as a public company, the Las Vegas-based firm exceeded analysts' expectations. It beat earnings and sales forecasts on top of lifting full-year guidance when it reported first-quarter results May 1.Revenue grew 18% year over year to $181 million, eclipsing the $177 million consensus of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) vaulted 37% from a year ago to $67 million, topping JPMorgan's forecasts of $51 million by 31%.Diamond raised its full-year 2014 EBITDA guidance to $265 million to $280 million, from previous guidance of $255 million to $265 million, partly because it managed to refinance a 12% loan at a much lower interest rate. It expects to save it about $22 million a year in interest.Performance Since IPODiamond stock has risen 40% from its $14 IPO price in July 2013.In a conference call with analysts, CEO Palmer said the company uses a ""capital-light model with minimal development capex required,"" which means that instead of building its own properties, Diamond adds inventory by buying out existing resorts. Diamond also collects fees from managing properties in homeowners associations.""Unlike its peers, with no significant plans to invest capital in new timeshare development, it sources inventory from recapturing vacation ownership interests from members who default on payment of their homeowners association dues and its bank of unsold points,"" JPMorgan analyst Joseph Gregg and colleagues wrote in a note May 1.Inside The IndustryAbout 30% of Diamond's earnings come from managing resorts, a task that's very profitable, says Gregg.""Diamond is in a position to generate appealing earnings growth, driven by what we view as sustainable operating momentum in vacation ownership and steady uplift in management fees,"" Gregg and colleagues noted. ""We forecast improving free cash-flow performance, given growth in its higher-margin management business.""Diamond is the 12th largest company by market cap in IBD's Leisure-Lodging industry group, whose biggest components are Hilton Worldwide Holdings (HLT), Marriott International (MAR) and Starwood Hotels & Resorts (HOT). The group is ranked No. 79 in performance of 197 that IBD tracks.Vacation ownership can be a controversial line of business, however, and Diamond is no stranger to complaints.""In one year, fees rose by more than 40%. A similar figure the next year. Soon the maintenance fees exceeded the cost of staying in a Diamond Resorts apartment for a holiday through Expedia (EXPE), including airfares,"" a Gloucestershire, U.K.-based entrepreneur, who did not want his name published, said in an email. ""To add insult to injury, it became almost impossible to get a booking for any property except during off peak.""Diamond's management fees exceeded rental rates by 47% to 180% for various properties he saw online, he says, and when he refused to pay, he got calls every day — sometimes twice a day — and was told that he would be turned over to a collection agency. Diamond finally canceled his contract after he complained to every agency in the U.S. and U.K. that would listen, he says.""I just made a right royal nuisance of myself,"" he said in an email.Unwanted Diamond points can be had for pennies on the dollar on eBay (EBAY) and timeshare-resale websites. Only 3% of timeshares sell on the resale market, says Jeff Griffen, a senior executive at ResortBailout.com. The East Hartford, Conn.-based firm helps clients unload a timeshare for one to three years in annual maintenance fees plus closing costs.Walking away from a timeshare is like letting a house go into foreclosure, which could result in property liens, stained credit histories and even wage garnishment, according to Griffen. In addition, customers can finance their purchase only through Diamond, he says.Over the past three years, 525 complaints against Diamond were filed with the Better Business Bureau. Owners in Koloa, Hawaii, filed a class-action lawsuit over a $65,822,529 water-intrusion assessment, local media reported.Investing RisksSince owning a timeshare is a luxury that most people can do without, a global or U.S. economic slowdown could deplete demand for new purchases or hinder people's ability to repay their loans.""Currently, no effective secondary market exists to resell timeshare,"" Robert LaFleur and Whitney Stevenson, analysts at JMP Securities, wrote in a note May 2. ""If an effective and cost-efficient secondary market develops, Diamond's ability to sell vacation interests through its existing sales channels could be seriously impaired.""Among other risks, rising interest rates would increase borrowing costs for both Diamond and its customers, which could squeeze margins and dampen demand.Diamond will be increasingly more dependent on the securities market to get money and maintain growth in vacation-ownership sales, Gregg of JPMorgan says. Growth depends on its success in selling to new customers rather than existing customers.

178,HLT,"Growth stocks show strength in a down market in many different ways.They can show tight weekly closes after a breakout, refusing to give up much ground.Or, when they do pull back, they show supporting action at their 10-week moving average.Another way great stocks show strength, either in a weakening market or in a bull market, is by forming a flat base.The price structure has been seen for decades in model-book studies of past stock market winners by IBD. Hilton (HLT) formed one in 1967 before a 232% advance in little more than a year. And Starbucks (SBUX) formed one in the second half of 2003 in the early stages of a new bull market. It more than doubled in 70 weeks.If you miss an initial breakout, watch for a potential flat base to form. It often appears after a stock breaks out of a cup with handle or a double bottom. In a flat base, the stock moves sideways in a tight price range for at least five weeks, showing a pullback of no more than 10% to 15%.Flat bases that show wide-and-loose, erratic swings should generally be avoided. Some might work, but plenty of others won't. If institutional support is truly strong for a stock, trading should be tight and orderly.The buy point in the flat base is 10 cents above the high of the left side of the base. A future Investor's Corner column will teach you how to identify earlier buy points in a flat base.Current Sector Leader Gilead Sciences (GILD) formed a flat base in 2012 that spawned a bullish upward move. It first cleared a consolidation in late July. The flat base that followed formed in five weeks and showed tight trading with a pullback of 9%.As the base formed, it paid a visit to its 10-week moving average (1).Gilead gapped out of the base at 35.25 (adjusted for a 2-for-1 split in early 2013) in the week ended Nov. 16, helped by news that a combination of its experimental hepatitis C therapies cleared the virus in all patients in a trial.Weekly volume in the breakout week totaled about 166 million shares (2), nearly double its average at the time.Buying a stock when it gaps out of a base is counterintuitive, but those who bought Gilead on the Nov. 12 breakaway gap up in price have been rewarded nicely. Gilead is up 163% from the 2012 breakout.

But concerns over the area's health ""have faded,"" RCA noted.Manhattan retained its throne as No. 1 in volume, as sales jumped 60% to $26.5 billion. Los Angeles followed with $12.7 billion, Chicago with $10.8 billion and Dallas at $8.2 billion.Houston was No. 11 as deal volume jumped 29% to $6.3 billion, a ""positive sign,"" said RCA, ""given that some investors were worried about this market when energy prices began their tumble.""Some of the fastest growing markets in terms of deal volume were in the South, including Orlando, West Palm Beach and Raleigh/Durham, with sales up 232%, 159% and 97%, respectively. Volume in the D.C./Virginia suburbs was up 99%, to $4.5 billion.Deal volume nationwide jumped 36% to $225.1 billion during the first six months of the year. But it was ""front loaded"" in the first quarter, which was up 49%, RCA noted. Sales in the second quarter totalled $118 billion, up 23%.Slower growth in Q2 might not be a bad thing, though, RCA noted. Had growth continued at Q1's same pace, it might have been the start of a ""frenzied market"" and potential ""bubble.""""As it stands, the lower growth in volume (in Q2) has not been matched with increases in cap rates, so it is not as if investors are pulling away from commercial real estate,"" the report said.Industrial and suburban office sectors showed the strongest growth, at 40% and 37%, respectively, RCA noted, adding that the two sectors offer good yields of around 7%.Other markets in the top-10 during the first half of the year were Seattle, at No. 7, followed by Boston, San Jose and New York City boroughs.In the second quarter, San Francisco also fell from its perch as a magnet for Chinese investors. It had ranked No. 2 in terms of inflow of Chinese capital in the first quarter and high in previous quarters.

"

268,HLT,"So individual investors might want to put the better lodging stocks on a watch list.The economic recovery since the 2007-09 recession has been lackluster. Despite stock market gains, the mood of business is cautious. If this truly is a recovery in the economy, and not just the stock market, where's the joy? For most businesses, the joy is missing.Yet, there's one area where industry insiders sound joyful — the hotel industry. In fact, compared to most executives, the lodging insiders sound wildly confident.On Wednesday, the day before the annual NYU International Hospitality Industry Investment Conference, HotelNewsNow.com reported quotes from industry insiders like this:""We are busier than we have been in ages,"" one said. Another said, ""The one word I have heard a lot is frothy."" A third pointed to ""tremendous liquidity."" A fourth asked, ""What could possibly go wrong?""Yet, for all the confidence, two things are clear. One is negative and the other positive.On the negative side, IBD's Leisure-Lodging stock group has only matched the Nasdaq this year — up 7%. In the past three months, the lodging group fell 3% vs. a 2% gain for the Nasdaq in the stock market.A selective approach doesn't fare much better. The four stocks with the best EPS Ratings in the lodging group also have slumped.Marriott International (MAR) is down 5% over the past three months and up only 1% year to date.Wyndham Worldwide (WYN) is off 7% over three months and flat so far this year.Hilton Worldwide (HLT) is up 1% over three months but up 12% year to date.Starwood Hotels and Resorts (HOT) is up 4% over three months and 4% so far this year.Why the disconnect between the stocks and the business?A monthly chart of the lodging stock group shows that, from a broader perspective, there is no disconnect.

271,HLT,"Forecasts for an improving economy and low gas prices should result in a busy summer for the U.S. tourism industry and a bullish outlook for companies that make money on free-spending vacationers.One of the likely beneficiaries is Marriott Vacations Worldwide (VAC). It develops, markets, sells and manages vacation ownership and related products — aka timeshares — under the Marriott Vacation Club, Grand Residences by Marriott and Ritz-Carlton Destination Club brands.Although Marriott Vacations Worldwide isn't as tied to macro factors as other travel-related stocks such as airlines, hotel operators and cruise lines, it still gets a lift when times are good.""The numbers in terms of people driving, as well as the forecasts for air travel, are back to pre-2008-09 levels. That bodes well for us,"" Chief Financial Officer John Geller told IBD. ""Going into the summer, we are optimistic and the trends are good.""Reflecting that optimism, Marriott Vacations Worldwide stock hit a record high of 89.85 on May 28 and is up about 18% this year.It is one of a number of stocks in IBD's Leisure-Services group to hit new highs in recent weeks. The group ranks No. 35 of 197 industries tracked and has moved steadily higher over the past six months.Other leaders in the group are a diverse mix that includes cruise operator Norwegian Cruise Line (NCLH), sports and entertainment company Madison Square Garden (MSG) and fellow timeshare company Interval Leisure Group (IILG).The Price Of ParadiseMarriott Vacations, which was spun off from Marriott International (MAR) in November 2011, has 59 resorts worldwide. In coming quarters, it will open new resorts in San Diego, Miami Beach and Hawaii.The company competes with the vacation ownership divisions of hotel rivals such as Hilton Worldwide Holdings (HLT), Starwood Hotels & Resorts (HOT), Wyndham Worldwide (WYN) and Hyatt Hotels (H).Marriott Vacations Worldwide plays in the high end of the market. The company's average first-time buyer spends $30,000 to $35,000 for the ability to stay a week each year — perpetually — at a two-bedroom, two-bath vacation home in locations such as Orlando, Fla., and Hilton Head, S.C.That compares with an average sales price of about $20,000 industrywide, according to data from the American Resort Development Association (ARDA), a timeshare trade association.It sounds like a lot of money until you start doing the math, says ARDA CEO Howard Nusbaum.""It's not like real estate in the sense that you don't make money flipping it,"" he told IBD. ""Your value comes from your use of the property. If you spend $3,000 a year for vacations, in 10 years you spent $30,000.""With a timeshare, you might spend that much and get a lifetime's worth of vacations, Nusbaum says.About half of Marriott Vacation Worldwide's revenue comes from contract sales to customers. It gets about 20% from resort management and other income, including what comes from some ancillary businesses like food and beverage, spas and golf courses, in addition to management fees.Another 20% comes from renting out unsold units. The remaining 10% comes from providing financing to customers, most of whom can't get timeshare loans from traditional lenders.For most of its three-plus years as a standalone company, Marriott Vacation Worldwide's revenue growth has hovered in the single digits. That's primarily because it spent its early years focusing on operating efficiently rather than growing rapidly.""Coming out of the spin-off, our focus was really about improving margins and looking at how to operate as a standalone company,"" CFO Geller said. ""We were less concerned about driving top-line growth.""From Crisis To CruisingMeanwhile, the timeshare industry itself was still emerging from the beating that it took in 2008-09, when the recession and financial crisis made it all but impossible for many Americans to get timeshare loans.Normally, the industry isn't that vulnerable to economic swings. That's because travelers who own timeshares don't have to worry about coming up with money for a place to stay. But the downturn of 2008-09 was different because ""the financing dried up overnight,"" Nusbaum said. Industry revenue fell by nearly half.""Timeshare companies couldn't get loans, so they couldn't offer loans to customers,"" he said. ""We had 20 years of double-digit growth, but the 2008-09 downturn was very humbling.""With those problems behind the industry, it is now back to double-digit growth, he says.As for Marriott Vacations Worldwide, it has moved into a new phase where it can put more focus on top-line growth. During the first quarter, it posted a 13% year-over-year revenue increase — its biggest gain since going public.""In the first quarter, we started to ramp up our marketing efforts,"" Geller said. ""We shifted our focus more to first-time buyers.""First-time buyers account for only about 40% of the company's contract sales, he says. The rest comes from sales to existing owners looking to upgrade or add to their portfolios.""We want to get that to more of a 50/50 ratio,"" Geller said.In the first quarter, Marriott Vacations Worldwide posted total revenue of $454.9 million, up from $401.9 million a year earlier. Total company contract sales climbed 23% to $198.4 million, while earnings rose 52% to 85 cents a share, as calculated on a diluted basis, topping the consensus estimate of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters.Renting 'Experiences' Pays OffMarriott Vacations Worldwide describes its points system, which members use to choose resorts and ""pay"" for stays, as a ""flexible 'vacation currency.'""And the company has added not only resorts but also things like cruises, guided tours and ""experiences"" that range from ski trips to golf excursions.""As we have been able to put our Destination Club in place — and it's really gotten a lot of traction — keep in mind that when our owners decide that they want to use their Vacation Club points for something other than staying in one of our resorts, whether they want to take a cruise or they want to take a tour or go to the Masters or whatever, they give us back those points for the year,"" CEO Steve Weisz said on the company's Q1 conference call in May. ""We turn around and take them into the open market, and we rent them. So that drives the revenue side of things.""If it all works right,"" Weisz said, ""we actually make a little bit in the arbitrage between what we rent it for and what we have to pay for the cost to fulfill the particular thing that they asked for, whether it be the cruise or the trip.""Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect the company's full-year EPS to rise 19% in 2015 and another 16% in 2016.""As the economy improves and wealth improves, demand for people going on vacation increases both in terms of the duration of their breaks, the number of breaks, and how much they're spending on different amenities like timeshares,"" MKM Partners analyst Christopher Agnew told IBD. ""That should be good for the industry.""

IBD's Leisure-Lodging industry group, ranked No. 26 of 197 groups, has risen 12% vs. the S&P 500 index's 8% for the year to date. This month Marriott International (MAR) is up 3% and Hyatt Hotels (H) 2%. They and other major hotel operators Hilton Worldwide (HLT), Intercontinental Hotels (IHG) and Wyndham Worldwide (WYN) are all up between 10% and 44% year-to-date.Marcus & Millichap's analysis of hotel industry demand predicated that the national occupancy rate would climb to 63.4% from 62.2% last year and that average daily rates would rise 4.5% to $115.31. Higher room rates and increased demand will lead revenue per room to grow 6.5% this year and overall revenue 7.5%, it said. In the first six months of the year, the nationwide average daily room rate rose 4.1%, slightly more than the rise a year ago. Revenue per average room jumped 7.5%, topping last year's 5.6% gain.The report noted that new brands and ""refreshes"" by hotels reflect the industry's ""courting of the millennials,"" those born between the 1980s to early 2000s. The huge new boom generation will likely account for nearly half of business-flight spending by 2020, the report added.Among the new brands and refreshes are Hilton's new Curio concept, consisting of independent hotels under the Hilton banner, and AC Hotels being introduced by Marriott in Miami, Chicago, New Orleans and New York, with more to come.Demand for hotel rooms was strongest in Denver, Nashville, Atlanta, San Diego and Dallas, according to Marcus & Millichap. Room demand in Denver jumped 10.7% in the first six month of 2014. A late recovering economy in Atlanta lifted room demand there.Among IBD's highest-ranked hotel stocks by Composite Rating are Wyndham, with a 97 out of a possible 99, Hyatt at 94, and then Marriott and Hilton at 93 and 92, respectively.

"
396,HLT,"Expectations for the IPO class of 2014 are heightened by 2013's fourth-quarter market performance. There were 77 IPOs in the quarter, up 22% from the 63 in the third quarter and up 103% from the year-earlier quarter, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers.
"
397,HLT,"""The environment for IPOs has remained highly accommodative and we expect the new issuance window to remain open as we head into 2014,"" said Henri Leveque, in a statement accompanying PwC's latest IPO report.2014: A Look Back And AheadThe U.S. IPO market of 2013 ranks as the best one in a decade and sets the stage for another dynamic year in 2014.Some 222 initial public offerings raised $55 billion in 2013, the most in both categories since 2000, according to IPO research and investment firm Renaissance Capital.These include Twitter (TWTR) — the biggest tech IPO since Facebook (FB) — and Hilton Worldwide (HLT), the biggest IPO ever for a hotel company and the second largest of 2013.The largest IPO of the year was Plains GP Holdings (PAGP), which raised $2.8 billion.The year also saw six stocks jump more than 100% on their first day of trading, as many as the prior seven years combined. The top first-day performer was Sprouts Farmers Market (SFM), up 123% on day one.Initial public offerings are an integral part of U.S economic growth and employment. Whether the IPO market will continue to boom, as always, depends on economic growth and the performance of equity markets.""If the stock markets stay healthy I expect at least as many IPOs in 2014 as last year,"" said Jay Ritter, Cordell Professor of Finance at University of Florida, who closely tracks the IPO field.Waiting At The GateCurrently 38 companies are registered to go public and seek to raise $6.5 billion, according to market intelligence firm Ipreo.The IPO pipeline is likely much larger, though. A provision of the Jobs Act of 2012 allows companies with sales of less than $1 billion to begin the IPO registration process while keeping it confidential until about a month before the IPO actually launches.The biggest IPO on the horizon is China e-commerce giant Alibaba Group, with its IPO likely to exceed the Facebook blockbuster in May 2012 that raised $16 billion.This year apparently won't see the recently planned IPO of car manufacturer Chrysler Group that was expected to exceed $10 billion. Chrysler's IPO may have died on Jan. 1 when Fiat disclosed that it would buy the 41.5% of Chrysler shares owned by a United Auto Workers trust, giving Fiat 100% ownership.But a large number of fast-growing technology firms are expected to launch.""2014 looks to be a strong year for tech IPOs,"" said Anand Sanwal, CEO of research firm CB Insights. ""There seems to be momentum on multiple fronts.""In a recent report, CB Insights counted 590 investor-backed private technology companies in the U.S. with valuations, ""real or rumored,"" of more than $100 million, up from 472 a year ago.""There's some frothiness, but there are still some very credible solid companies that will test the water this year,"" said Anand.Of those 590 companies, e-commerce is the most popular sector, followed by online ad technology management.Can Alibaba Top Facebook?Alibaba has the potential to be one of the biggest technology IPOs of all time. Founded in 1999 by Jack Ma, Alibaba is China's largest e-commerce company, with businesses similar to Amazon.com (AMZN), eBay (EBAY) and other players.Alibaba comprises nine companies. They include shopping sites, a payment-processor business similar to PayPal, coupon sites and a search engine site. It also has a cloud-computing business and a business-to-business site.According to projections by research firm PrivCo, Alibaba's projected offering could exceed $18 billion, with the company achieving a market valuation near $110 billion.Facebook, the largest tech IPO and second-largest U.S. IPO ever, raised $16 billion and had a market capitalization in its first trading day of $104 billion. PrivCo estimates Alibaba will have sales of $6.85 billion this year, up 68%. The IPO is expected to launch in the first quarter.Another company that would draw lots of interest is Pinterest, the website where users — in a process termed ""pinning"" — post photos, images and other kinds of content to their profile pages, which other users can follow. Pinterest recently completed a $225 million funding round, giving it a valuation of $3.8 billion.Other high-profile tech firms expected to conduct IPOs include Square, which provides various payment-processing services for mobile phones and tablets. In September 2012, Square raised more than $200 million in a financing round that reportedly valued the company at $3.35 billion. According to reports, it is seeking another round of financing that would give it a $5 billion valuation.Others include Box and Dropbox, both providing cloud-based storage and file-sharing services for business and consumers. The list of tech companies also includes music-playing website Spotify and lodging rental website Airbnb.Other notable companies expected to go public in 2014, according to Renaissance Capital, include CBS Outdoor America, one of the largest providers of billboard advertising, and Univision Communications, the Spanish language U.S. broadcaster.

420,HLT,"Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (HLT  -  Free Report) has been continuously focusing on unit growth as a major growth strategy. To this end, the company announced the opening of The Bernic Hotel New York City by Tapestry Collection. Marking the first Tapestry Collection property in New York City, the hotel is located in close proximity to the Grand Central Station and Rockefeller Center.Notably, in May 2018, Hilton had announced that two of its marketing leading brands — Curio Collection and Tapestry Collection — will boost its portfolio with seven hotels in the United States. Already having six hotels under Tapestry collection, the company further plans to enhance the portfolio of this brand by adding three more hotels.We observe that shares of Hilton have rallied 30.2% in the past year, outperforming the industry’s growth of 13.3%.Expansion to Drive Growth & Fend Off CompetitionThe move underscores Hilton’s absolute focus on aggressively expanding its brands in both the domestic and international markets. To maintain its position as the fastest-growing global hospitality company, Hilton is continuously driving unit growth. In 2017, Hilton witnessed net unit growth of 18,400 rooms. Further, the company expanded its footprint across new countries for a total of 105 countries and territories. For 2018, it projects an approximate 6.5% net unit growth.Hilton’s relentless expansion helps it in strategizing against growing competition in the industry. The company is continuously facing intense competition from large hotel chains like Marriott (MAR  -  Free Report) and Hyatt (H  -  Free Report), and also from new channels of distribution in the travel industry. Additional sources of competition include large companies that offer online travel services as part of their business model such as Alibaba (BABA  -  Free Report). Hilton, therefore, through its disciplined as well as strategic operations, and expansion is trying to navigate stiff competition.Enhancing Customer LoyaltyOpening of the Bernic seems to be part of Hilton’s efforts to enhance customer loyalty, more so because the brand is a component of Hilton Honors, one of the largest loyalty programs. With about 74 million members, this network emerged as a highly valuable asset for the company.  In 2017, Hilton added more than 11 million members to this program. Also, in the first quarter of 2018, more than 3 million members were added to Hilton Honors. In the meantime, innovations such as the Hilton Honors app continue to boost the program. In fact, more than half of the occupancy per night takes place through this membership program. The company is focused on making multiple enhancements to its loyalty program in order to make it the most customer centric, driving incremental value for guests and the overall system.Hilton currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

421,HLT,"Hyatt Hotels Corporation (H  -  Free Report), in partnership with JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s (JPM  -  Free Report) Chase card services, has announced the debut of the World of Hyatt Credit Card. The credit card is expected to ease everyday purchase of travelers with greater rewards for members.The new card will promptly elevate customers’ status, aiding them to earn free nights at Hyatt destinations. Additionally, the card will provide added facilities in terms of points gain across services.We observe that Hyatt’s shares have rallied 36.1% over the past year, outperforming the industry’s 12.7% collective rally.Let’s discuss the rationale behind the enhancement of World of Hyatt and its prospects.Loyalty Program Eyes Top-Line Growth, Fends Off CompetitionSuccessful innovation has been a trademark of Hyatt, with commitment of customer-friendly services in both the large-scale convention and smaller leisure markets. By enriching loyalty program with the introduction of credit card facilities, Hyatt is trying to facilitate greater guest engagement that would eventually raise occupancy. The company has been devising newer ways to enhance the guest loyalty program. In fact, it is already witnessing a higher level of guest satisfaction due to the enhancement of World of Hyatt. As of Dec 31, 2017, the loyalty program had more than 10 million active members. During 2017, approximately 30% of total system-wide room nights were favored by the program.Hyatt believes that enhanced guest experience should favor top-line growth. The company is trying to facilitate revenue per available room (RevPAR) growth by offering enriched services to guests, which has thereby generated substantial demand. With the introduction of Hyatt’s unique services that involve engaging more customers, the company is successfully navigating the tough economic environment, plagued with intense competition. The company has a creative approach to food and beverage at its hotels worldwide, and created profitable and popular venues that build and enhance demand for hotel properties.Strategies to engage customers therefore should help the company increase market share, thus boosting business. We believe that the strategies are part of Hyatt’s plan to leapfrog competitors like Marriott (MAR  -  Free Report) and Hilton (HLT  -  Free Report) in the race to gain greater market share.Currently, Hyatt carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

422,HLT,"Marriott International, Inc.’s (MAR  -  Free Report) consistent efforts to expand its presence worldwide and capitalize on demand for hotels in international markets are commendable. Recently, the company acquired the 1,000-room Sheraton Grand Phoenix hotel for $255 million.Marriott plans to renovate the hotel, which will begin in 2019. Apart from meeting space of nearly 77,000 square feet, the hotel has a fitness and business center along with lobby restaurants and poolside bar.Marriott’s president and CEO, Arne Sorenson said “The hotel will provide a living and breathing showcase of our new vision for the Sheraton brand, underscoring our commitment to restore the brand to its leadership position.”Currently, Marriott’s Sheraton brand operates about 450 hotels in over 70 countries across the globe. We note that Marriott is consistently trying to expand its presence in international and domestic market to capitalize on growing demand for hotels. Notably, after announcing the acquisition of Starwood Hotels & Resorts on Sep 23, 2016, Marriott has become the world’s largest hotel company spanning across 127 countries, with more than 6,500 properties.In fact, Marriott’s extensive portfolio and a strong brand position allows it to charge a premium room rate in the highly competitive lodging industry. Given its property locations, we believe that the company is well poised to benefit from increasing market demand owing to stepped-up business as well as leisure traveling in major North American and international locations. Furthermore, Marriott is expected to benefit from a steady rise in business and leisure travel, and higher transaction volumes in the near as well as long term.  Also, global travel is estimated to increase at a 7% compounded rate over the next 10 years and international trips expected to top 1.8 billion by 2030.Marriott currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

(HLT  -  Free Report), which belong to the same industry, have witnessed growth of 36.1%, 11% and 26.5%, respectively.Although headwinds persist in the form of lingering political uncertainty in key international markets and currency headwinds, Marriott is well poised to grow in the long term backed by its continual expansion efforts and an unmatched portfolio of lodging brands.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

423,HLT,"Shares of Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (HLT  -  Free Report) are riding high on the rise in rate and occupancy, robust demand at the company’s international hotels and improved strategic initiatives. These efforts have aided the company to drive its share price by 30.2% in a year, outperforming the industry’s increase of 20.8%. However, intense competition and cyclical nature of the industry remain concerns. Let’s delve deeper.Hidden CatalystsIn a bid to maintain its position as the fastest-growing global hospitality company, Hilton is continuing to drive unit growth. In 2017, the company witnessed net unit growth of 18,400 rooms. Further, in the first quarter of 2018, the company achieved net unit growth of 7,100 rooms and witnessed an increase of 7% from the prior-year quarter. For 2018, the company projects an approximate 6.5% net unit growth. It also continues to have more rooms under construction in Europe, the Middle East and Asia Pacific than any other hotel chain. The company expects greater international expansion in 2018.Hilton’s broad geographic diversity lowers the effect of volatility in individual markets. Evidently, Mexico and Canada have been experiencing strong leisure demand, leading to solid RevPAR growth. Further, Europe’s RevPAR trends are being supported by favorable exchange rates as well as strength in regions including Spain, the U.K., Germany, Turkey and others. Meanwhile, strength in China and Japan has led to solid RevPAR growth in the Asia Pacific region as well.The company has created one of the largest loyalty programs, Hilton Honors. With about 74 million members, this network has created an extremely valuable asset for the company. In 2017, the company added over 11 million members to the program. Further, more than 3 million members were added to Hilton Honors in the first quarter of 2018. In the meantime, innovations such as the Hilton Honors app continue to drive growth in the program.Further, Hilton has transformed into a capital-light operating business backed by the spin-offs of a portfolio of hotels and resorts as well as timeshare business. Post spin-off, the company expects to be a resilient, fee-driven business with disciplined strategies. In fact, the focus is expected to be on growing market share, units, free cash flow per share as well as preserving its strong balance sheet and accelerating return of capital. Furthermore, as Hilton’s unit growth is mostly financed by third parties, the company is capable of generating substantial returns on minimal capital investment. ConcernsCompared with other big hotel chains, Hilton has a lower mix of luxury and upper upscale rooms. An increasing supply of such upscale hotels may not have a rewarding impact on Hilton. Unless the company develops its luxury portfolio alongside its other rooms, it has a good chance of losing out on the emerging demand.Increasingly, the company also faces competition from new channels of distribution in the travel industry. Additional sources of competition include large companies that offer online travel services as part of their business model such as Alibaba (BABA), search engines such as Google, and peer-to-peer inventory sources such as Airbnb and HomeAway, allowing travelers to book stays on websites that facilitate short-term rental homes and apartments from owners, consequently providing an alternative to hotel rooms. Further, intense competition from large hotel chains like Marriott (MAR  -  Free Report) and Hyatt (H  -  Free Report) as well as smaller independent local hospitality providers remains a potent threat.Zacks Rank & Key PickHilton currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A better-ranked stock from the same space is Marriott Vacations Worldwide Corporation (VAC  -  Free Report), carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

424,HLT,"Hyatt Hotels Corporation (H  -  Free Report) announced plans to expand the footprint of its Hyatt Centric brand with new hotels in Los Angeles, Philadelphia, and Portland. Previously, the company had declared its plans to open Hyatt Centric hotels in Dakar, Senegal, San Salvador, El Salvador and Melbourne, Australia. These additions testify the strong potential of the brand.  Currently, it has 22 properties in seven countries.It is to be noted that Hyatt is consistently trying to strengthen its foothold worldwide and capitalize on demand for hotels in international markets, apart from expanding its presence domestically. Expansion in these lucrative markets should help the company gain market share in the hospitality industry, thus boosting its business.Additionally, Hyatt aims to differentiate its brands by providing a distinct experience for different travelers. It further intends to continue gaining global market traction on its solid brand portfolio, and innovative and exceptional personalized service to guests. The company’s remodeled loyalty program and innovative offerings are also likely to boost occupancy.Launched in 2015, the Hyatt Centric brand is swiftly gaining momentum. It is a brand of full-service lifestyle hotels located in prime destinations, particularly catering to millennial-minded travelers. Meanwhile, the company’s new signings across its brands globally have consistently outpaced its openings and this trend is expected to continue in 2018. In first-quarter 2018, Hyatt registered net room growth of 7.2% on a year-over-year basis, which marked the 12th successive quarter of growth above 6%. For 2018, the company expects to grow units on a net rooms basis, by roughly 6% to 6.5%, reflecting 60 new hotel openings.Price PerformanceShares of Hyatt have surged 44.1% in a year, outperforming the industry’s increase of 19.4%. Stocks like Extended Stay America, Inc. (STAY  -  Free Report), Marriott Vacations Worldwide Corporation (VAC  -  Free Report) and Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc.

425,HLT,"Impressive performances by U.S. hotel companies in first-quarter 2018 has raised expectations for the remainder of the year.Underpinning this favorable view is the positive outlook for the U.S. economy, thanks to healthy consumer spending, a strong labor market, rising government expenditures and increased consumer confidence.The U.S. economy is anticipated to grow at an annualized rate of 4% in the second quarter, per the Atlanta Federal Reserve’s GDPNow forecast model (as of May 25). This marks a sharp increase from 2.3% GDP growth registered in the first quarter of 2018.  Robust domestic data gives an indication that the industry will continue its bull run in the second half of 2018.Thus, there are plenty of reasons to be optimistic about the broader hotel industry over the short and the long term. Below, we discuss what investors can look forward to in the coming period:Steady Growth in DemandThe supply-demand environment in the United States has been favorable since 2010 with growth in demand outpacing supply growth. Though, of late, the gap between demand and supply growth has narrowed considerably and occupancy growth has decelerated, higher average daily rates (ADRs) will continue to drive revenue per available room (RevPAR).Given the positive economic outlook for the remainder of the year, which could result in the ninth successive year of occupancy growth for the U.S. lodging industry, PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) projects demand (+2.4%) to outpace supply (+2.0%) in 2018. Further, in 2019, it anticipates demand and supply growth of 1.9% each. Occupancy in 2018 is likely to increase 0.3% to 66.3%.International Expansion to Drive GrowthMost of the hotel companies are exploring international expansion, especially in relatively untapped emerging markets and the outlying areas surrounding major cities. Unsaturated markets in the Asia Pacific, the Middle East, Brazil, Russia and Africa are being targeted by hospitality companies.China, which is the largest source market for outbound travel, is the most significant market for the hotel industry. In less than two decades China has become the world’s most powerful outbound market for hotels and leisure.Interestingly, the country is a major revenue contributor for Marriott International, Inc. (MAR  -  Free Report) which entered into a joint venture with Alibaba with an aim to improve market share, expand membership of its loyalty programs and reduce distribution costs. India is also becoming a hot spot for U.S.-based hotel businesses as it gains precedence as a global business hub. Although economic growth rates are slightly lower than China, the country has great long-term growth potential as a tourism market.In fact, Hyatt Hotels Corp.’s (H  -  Free Report) major target markets include India and China. Apart from these, the company also has expansion plans for diverse international markets including Australia, Brazil, Germany, United Kingdom, Indonesia, Japan, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Thailand and the Netherlands, among others.Meanwhile, Europe remains an attractive market despite repeated terror attacks and Brexit-induced uncertainties. Major players like Marriott, Hilton Worldwide (HLT  -  Free Report), Choice Hotels (CHH  -  Free Report) and WyndhamWorldwide WYN have a strong foothold in this region.Several players in the space are also looking to leverage from rise in accommodation demand in Latin America. In this respect, WyndhamHotel Group acquired Latin America's leading Fen Hotels. Meanwhile, with an increasing number of managed and franchised limited service hotels in Mexico, Colombia and Brazil, Marriott expects its distribution in the Caribbean and Latin American region to increase 75% by 2018.Loyalty Programs Attract CustomersLoyalty programs are one of the major driving factors in the hotel industry. In order to survive in a tough economic environment, the companies continuously devise ways to enhance guest experience and raise occupancy. Given the fact that reward members stay longer than non-members and generate more revenues for their franchisees, hotel chains have been increasingly focusing on loyalty programs.Hilton has created one of the largest loyalty programs, Hilton Honors. With about 74 million members, this network has created an extremely valuable asset for the company. In 2017, the company added over 11 million members to the program. Also, in the first quarter of 2018, more than 3 million members were added to Hilton Honors. Innovations such as the Hilton Honors app continue to drive growth in the program.With about 52 million members, Wyndham Rewards offers one of the most generous reward program payouts in the industry. In fact, per a recent study conducted by Ideaworks Company, Wyndham Rewards is touted as the most-rewarding loyalty program in the U.S. hotel industry.Recently, Marriott International announced its plans to unify its loyalty program benefits across Marriott Rewards, The Ritz-Carlton Rewards and Starwood Preferred Guest (SPG) in August. The combined loyalty program is expected to provide richer perks to the company’s loyalty members by enabling them to earn roughly 20% points for every dollar spent.The new loyalty program will provide members more than what was offered under the prior programs. Under this global loyalty program, members can book stays, and earn or redeem points across 29 brands covering 6,500 hotels in 127 countries and territories.Digital InnovationsIn an era of stiff competition, hotel companies are leaving no stone unturned to drive growth. In this regard, digital innovation and social media have started to play a key role. Social media can enhance a brand’s prospects by connecting directly with guests, especially millennials and can, in turn, increase loyalty and market share. Social media sites like Facebook, Inc. (FB  -  Free Report), Twitter, Inc. (TWTR  -  Free Report) and TripAdvisor Inc. (TRIP  -  Free Report) are commonly used by travelers to select hotels and in this way these enhance a brand’s prospects by connecting directly with guests.Moreover, hotel chains use apps to help guests manage bookings and offer interactive maps/GPS to increase occupancy and offer a faster and seamless experience. The companies are investing in mobile check-in, fast Wi-Fi and digital room keys to enhance guest experience.In fact, mobile check-ins and check-outs have increased substantially over the past few years and so has the enthusiasm for chat-based messaging apps, like chatbots, among potential customers. Being tech savvy is thus no longer an option but a necessity to survive in the intensely competitive hotel industry.The companies are also using analytics tools to understand consumer preferences and deliver a differentiated experience, which could eventually motivate customers to visit frequently, stay longer and spend more.Key PicksCurrently, a top-ranked stock in the hotel space is Marriott Vacations Worldwide Corp.

426,HLT,"Wyndham Worldwide Corporation’s  subsidiary, Wyndham Hotels & Resorts, has completed the buyout of La Quinta Holdings' hotel franchising and hotel management business.The acquisition will help Wyndham to significantly improve its hotel management business and strengthen its brand presence globally. La Quinta has an asset-light, fee-for-service business structure, which consists of nearly 900 managed and franchised hotels. On the flipside, Wyndham operates a portfolio of 20 lodging brands and has approximately 9,000 hotels across 80 countries and six continents.La Quinta, being one of the largest midscale brands in the industry, is likely to drive Wyndham Hotel Group's midscale presence and help it enter the fast-growing upper-midscale segment. Earlier, Wyndham had projected that the deal will result in $55 million to $70 million of annual cost savings and also boost revenues significantly by the end of 2019.As it is, Wyndham is constantly trying to expand globally through acquisitions as the firms acquired so far have properties in Europe, North America and Latin America.We believe that expansion through acquisitions is helping hotels consolidate and strengthen their presence worldwide. With intensifying competition from different sites like Airbnb or Priceline, the fusing of different hotels will lend a scale advantage to individual hoteliers. Also, companies can rake in higher profits in the competitive market by uniting their resources.As announced earlier, Wyndham Worldwide’s board of directors has given a green signal for spinoff of its hotel business – Wyndham Hotel Group – resulting in two separate publicly traded companies. Wyndham Hotels & Resorts will trade under the symbol “WH” on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) beginning Jun 1, 2018. Price PerformanceIn a year’s time, shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have gained 5.4% compared with the industry’s increase of 17.5%.

427,HLT,"Stocks in the hotel industry are benefiting from growth in demand that supports increases in both occupancy and average daily rate (ADR). The momentum in the U.S. hotel industry continues in 2018 after moderate growth in 2017. In first-quarter 2018, the industry witnessed a better-than-expected rise in demand, with revenue per available room (RevPAR) increasing by 3.5%.Consequently, stocks in the Hotels and Motels Industry have put on an impressive show in the past year, handily outperforming the broader market, as a reflection of this positive backdrop. The Zacks Hotels and Motels Industry has rallied 20.2%, surpassing the S&P 500 index’s gain of 14.5%.The industry looks attractive, owing to rise in occupancy rate and gain in commercial transient demand. Further, we note that rising employment, higher real income and increased household net worth reinforced consumer confidence and sentiment. This has resulted in a steady rise in business and leisure travel, and higher transaction volumes, which are likely to continue.The unemployment rate declined from 3.9% in April to 3.8% in May, the lowest in 18 years. The U6 unemployment rate, which includes people forced into part-time work and people sporadically looking for jobs, declined to 7.6%, the lowest level witnessed since May 2001.Going forward, consumer and business spending are expected to keep the mood upbeat, suggesting that the U.S. economy will remain on solid footing in 2018. In fact, the Atlanta Federal Reserve’s GDPNow model forecasts healthy 4.8% (annualized rate) GDP growth in second-quarter 2018.Numbers Look ImpressiveA recent report by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) shows that new supply is likely to rise 2% in 2018, up from 1.8% in 2017. This is likely to result in 0.3% increase in occupancy rates in 2018 to 66.3%. Moreover, ADR and RevPAR are projected to climb 2.6% and 3%, respectively this year. In 2019, the industry is likely to register ADR and RevPAR growth of 2.8% each.Meanwhile, the Baird/STR Hotel Stock Index, which comprises 20 of the largest market capitalization hotel companies publicly traded on a U.S. exchange and attempts to characterize the performance of hotel stocks, rose 1.6% in April 2018. In fact, in a year, the index has gained 12.7%.Additionally, according to Smith Travel Research (STR), a leading information and data provider for the lodging industry and Tourism Economics, U.S. hotels continue to witness robust improvement across all metrics. However, the report revealed that occupancy rate will decline in the fourth quarter of 2018 and in 2019 due to rise in demand post hurricane in 2017. Despite this, the industry will continue to report record performance due to robust industry fundamental.Decline in International Travel a ConcernFall in international travel in the recent times has been a major concern for the U.S. lodging industry. Moreover, negative sentiment related to traveling to and from the United States, given Trump administration’s stringent policies on immigration and tourism visas,is detrimental to hotels. If the U.S. dollar gains strength, this may keep industry growth in check, given its impact on inbound international travel.Additionally, higher costs and increased supply along with pockets of geopolitical instability and economic slowdown are likely to be headwinds.Meanwhile, hotel companies have been focusing on renovation, and digital and marketing initiatives to boost traffic and capitalize on growing tourism numbers. However, steep costs incurred by leading hotel companies to do so are taking a toll on profits. High labor costs will continue to be a major concern for hoteliers. In fact, online travel agents like Booking.com (BKNG  -  Free Report), Expedia Inc. (EXPE  -  Free Report) and TripAdvisor (TRIP  -  Free Report) are also limiting the pricing power of these brands.Another major threat comes from home-sharing companies like Airbnb, Inc., which offer digital service, allowing travelers to book homes at holiday destinations. With lower overhead costs and far less regulations than what hotel companies have to comply with, these firms have made steady inroads into the industry and are grabbing share from giants like Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (HLT  -  Free Report) and Marriott International, Inc. (MAR  -  Free Report). Both companies currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Catalysts Driving GrowthThe hotel industry is particularly vulnerable to the ebbs and flows of economic conditions. So the present solid economic fundamentals are likely to spur consumer spending in the remainder of 2018, raising optimism for hotel companies. Moreover, hotel companies will be able to counter any economic volatility better, if they keep moving from owning real estate to franchising their brands and services.Also, these companies must look for ways to sustain their growth as online private accommodation aggregators flood the marketplace with new inventory. In fact, Marriott’s acquisition of Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide Inc. was viewed as a move to combat the rising threat from online travel agents and home-sharing companies. Other hotel chains like Hyatt Hotels Corp. (H  -  Free Report) and Wyndham Worldwide Corp. WYN are also investing in home-sharing start-ups to combat Airbnb.So far in 2018, the hotel industry has proved to be resilient amid marketplace shift. Going forward, the industry is likely to witness continued success.Thus, as hotel companies strive to enhance value and competitiveness, industry-best practices such as sustainability, brand refreshment and increased visibility through technological innovation and social networking – especially among millennials – will remain priorities. Focused investment in infrastructure to attract business and leisure travelers will also hold the key to growth.Valuation PictureLooking at the industry’s trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA ratio (Enterprise Value/Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization), the space’s valuation picture remains a bit stretched. The industry is currently trading at 16.81X trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA. Over the last five years, the industry has traded as high as 22.62X and as low as 10.8X, with a median of 13.95X. The S&P 500 Index is currently at 11.54X trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA, with the broader index’s five-year high, low and median at 12.67X, 7.49X, and 9.8 X, respectively.Zacks Industry RankWithin the Zacks Industry classification, hotel companies are broadly grouped in the Consumer Discretionary sector (one of the 16 Zacks sectors).We rank 255 industries into 16 Zacks sectors based on earnings outlook and fundamental strength of the constituent companies in each industry. We put our X industries into two groups: the top half (industries with the best average Zacks Rank) and the bottom half (the industries with the worst average Zacks Rank).In fact, our back-testing shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1. Over the last 10 years, using a one-week rebalance, the top half beat the bottom half by more than twice as much. The Zacks Industry Rank for Hotels & Motels industry is currently #212 (Bottom 17%).The ranking is available on the Zacks Industry Rank page.Earnings TrendsThe Hotels & Motels industry falls under the broader Consumer Discretionary sector.If we look at the overall results of the sector, per the latest report, earnings have grown 15.2% in the first quarter while total revenues are up 6%.Meanwhile, for the second quarter, revenues are expected to rise 6%, and earnings are projected to record a gain of 8.2%. For 2018, while revenues are expected to rise 5.8%, earnings are anticipated to increase 12%.For more details about earnings for this sector and others, please read our Earnings Trend report. ConclusionThe U.S. hotel industry has been benefiting from several factors like a strong economy, higher income, increased consumer confidence and a strong labor market. As people are steadfast on spending time with loved ones and keep looking for unique experiences at all price points, companies in the space believe that their diverse portfolio of offerings can continue to deliver on this growing demand.The U.S. economy expanded at a pace of 2.3% in the first quarter, above the consensus estimate. However, it represents a decline from 3% witnessed in the last three quarters of 2017. While declines were felt across all components, consumer spending declined significantly after strong gains in the fourth quarter of 2017.This may appear to be a concern at the first glance but first-quarter figures have been dismal in recent years due to statistical and weather-related issues. Other consumer-related indicators are on the rise, which means that consumer spending should pick up in the rest of the year. Investing in consumer discretionary stocks looks like a smart option at this point. Further, the U.S. economy is expected to expand at a 4% annualized rate in the second quarter, per the latest forecast by Atlanta Federal Reserve’s GDPNow.Thus, we see no reason why the industry should not continue to enjoy gains on both the top and bottom lines in the near-to-middle term, especially when the unemployment rate is at a 18-year low and wages are growing at the quickest pace since the end of the last decade.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

428,HLT,"Hyatt Hotels Corporation (H  -  Free Report) is planning to expand its footprint in Canada. Accordingly, it intends to add 12 new hotels under its Hyatt Place and Hyatt House brand in the next few years. This, in turn, will boost the company’s portfolio and strengthen its fast growing select-service category. Currently, Hyatt has nine hotels operating under this brand in Canada.Per management, there is a lot of scope for the company’s growth in Canada. In fact, Hyatt strongly believes that the opportunity for properties that offer selected services at a lower price than full-service hotels is particularly compelling for a large spread of consumers. Notably, these services cater to the needs of growing number of local business travelers.Hyatt, therefore, is growing its select-service presence via third-party construction of new franchised properties, conversion and renovation of existing non-Hyatt properties, and in certain cases, through participation in the development of new managed properties.By doing so, Hyatt is systematically expanding its global presence and capitalizing on demand for hotels in international markets. Expansion in these markets should help the company gain market share in the hospitality industry, thus strengthening business.Also, Hyatt plans to differentiate its brands from one another by providing distinct travel experiences. Meanwhile, it is consistently trying to expand the company’s presence worldwide. In this regard, Hyatt’s expansion plans in Asia-Pacific, Europe, Africa, Middle East and Latin America appear promising. Price PerformanceIn a year’s time, shares of Hyatt have surged 48.7%, outperforming the industry’s increase of 20.8%. Stocks like Extended Stay America, Inc. (STAY  -  Free Report), Marriott Vacations Worldwide Corporation (VAC  -  Free Report) and Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc.

429,HLT,"LaSalle Hotel Properties (LHO  -  Free Report) announced that it has reached a definitive agreement with affiliates of Blackstone Group LP (BX  -  Free Report), per which the private equity behemoth will acquire all outstanding common shares of LaSalle for $33.50 per share, in an all-cash deal, valuing the acquisition at $4.8 billion.The private equity firm outbid Pebblebrook Hotel Trust’s (PEB  -  Free Report) offer that in April bid $3.5 billion in a cash-and-stock deal to acquire the company that owns 41 upscale hotels in 11 markets across seven states and the District of Columbia.Notably, Blackstone’s offer represents a premium of 5% to LaSalle's shares closing price on May 18, 2018, before news of the acquisition surfaced. Further, the all-cash deal might also have given the company an edge over Pebblebrook’s offer providing immediate and certain cash value to the hotel owner. In addition, it provides significant premium to the company’s shareholders.On the other hand, the deal is a strategic fit for Blackstone, which, of late, has been dominating the lodging sector with its remarkable acquisition and disposition activities. The firm typically buys hotels and other real estate holdings at cheap valuations and disposes those at a profit after restructuring operations.Evidently, Blackstone recently sold its stake in Hilton Worldwide Holdings (HLT  -  Free Report), for approximately $1.32 billion, after investing in the company for nearly 11 years.Notably, hotel real estate investment trusts (REIT) have been witnessing impressive price rallies amid bright prospects. Several tailwinds, including improving economy, growth in employment and rise in wages, are likely to spur demand for hotels in the upcoming quarters. Particularly, improved room demand on the back of positive consumer outlook and strong demand from leisure division signal better prospects for hotel REITs.Shares of this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company have surged 35.7%, outperforming its industry’s growth of 3.3% in the past three months. Moreover, its 2018 funds from operations (FFO) per share have witnessed 4.3% upward revision in the past month. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

433,HLT,"Wyndham Worldwide Corporation  is currently one of the best-performing stocks in the hotel space. With a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and decent share price appreciation the stock is a lucrative investment choice at the moment. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) Rank stocks here.Shares of Wyndham have outperformed its industry in the past year. The stock has rallied 35.7% as compared with the industry’s growth of 31.5%.Moreover, an upward revision in earnings estimates for 2018 reflects analysts’ unwavering confidence in the company’s future earnings. Over the last 60 days, the consensus estimate for 2018 earnings rose 3.5%. Further, the company delivered positive earnings surprises in the trailing four quarters, recording an average beat of 4.14%.La Quinta Acquisition to Enhance Margins & EarningsTraditionally, gross margin for hospitality companies are always comparatively higher as majority of its expenses come from cost of operations. However, the sector’s profit margin narrows, once these expenses from operations are taken into account. Consequently, net profit margin or net margin is considered the accurate metric for gauging the profits of hospitality companies. Wyndham’s trailing 12-month net margin is 15.4% higher than the industry’s 8.8%.Moreover, with the recent merger agreement with La Quinta Holdings, Wyndham’s expects $55 million to $70 million in annual cost savings by the end of 2019. This can be attributed to La Quinta’s asset-light, fee-for-service business structure which will further improve Wyndham’s margins and facilitate earnings growth.Arguably, earnings growth is of utmost importance for determining a stock’s potential, as surging profit levels often indicate solid prospects (and stock price gains). In 2018, Wyndham’s earnings per share are expected to grow 24.7%.Robust Loyalty Program to Increase OccupancyIn order to survive the tough competition from hotel giants like Marriott (MAR  -  Free Report), Hyatt (H  -  Free Report) and Hilton (HLT  -  Free Report), Wyndham is constantly devising newer ways to increase its share of market by raising occupancy. In order to enhance guest experience and drive occupancy, the company offers one of the most generous reward program payouts in the industry. Currently, there are about 55 million members in Wyndham Rewards, an increase of 5.8% over prior year. In 2017, the company made Wyndham Rewards points redemption available to nearly 100 Wyndham Vacation Ownership properties, to generate new marketing opportunities between the two businesses.Solid Return to ShareholdersWyndham is consistently rewarding shareholders through repurchases and dividends. Ever since the initiation of its share repurchase program in 2007, the company has expanded the same by eight times and bought back shares worth $6 billion. Meanwhile, the company’s ongoing dividend policy is likely to grow its dividend at least at the rate of its earnings growth. Currently, Wyndham has a payout ratio of 42%. Further, it has a dividend yield of 2.4%, higher than the industry’s 0.1%. We appreciate the company’s efforts to consistently enhance shareholder returns.Moreover, the company delivered an ROE of 92.39% in the trailing 12 months compared with its industry’s 6.02%. This supports its immense growth potential and indicates that Wyndham reinvests more efficiently compared with peers.Valuation Looks StrongLooking at Wyndham’s Price to Earnings Ratio (P/E) for the current fiscal year, investors might be willing to pay more as the company is undervalued compared with peers. The company’s P/E ratio for the trailing 12 months stands at 18.5 while that of the industry’s is 31x.Moreover, per our VGM Score, which identifies the most attractive value, growth and momentum characteristics, Wyndham has a Value Score of B which indicates that the stock is most likely to outperform.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

434,HLT,"Hyatt Hotels Corporation (H  -  Free Report) announced the expansion of its loyalty program, World of Hyatt, to the leading provider of home service accommodation, known as Oasis. Guests opting for the home sharing space with Oasis can earn and redeem Hyatt’s loyalty points.Oasis home rentals belong to The Unbound Collection by Hyatt brand, especially designed for customers who demand home stays with luxury hotel amenities. Under the World of Hyatt loyalty program, members would be rewarded with 5 Base Points per dollar spent on Oasis nights and are allowedto redeem 15,000 points for a $200 credit toward an Oasis stay. Elite members can earn bonus points and are given late check-out options.Notably, Oasis’s operations across the globe expand Hyatt’s footprint in untapped markets like Barcelona, Ibiza, Punta del Este (Uruguay) and Trancoso (Brazil). The above move, thus, underscores Hyatt’s relentless expansion strategies to strengthen its brand position globally. It also indicates the company’s commitment toward devising ways to enhance guest experience and raise occupancy.We observe that Hyatt shares have rallied 45.5% over the past six months, outperforming the industry’s 39.2% growth.Let us discuss the rationale behind Hyatt’s expansion strategies, enhancementof World of Hyatt and its prospects.International Expansion to Counter CompetitionThe strategy is in-line with Hyatt’s consistent efforts to expand presence worldwide and capitalize on the demand for hotels in relatively untapped international markets. In fact, the company also has expansion plans for Europe, Asia-Pacific, Africa, Middle East and Latin America. International expansion should help the company increase its market share, thus boosting its business. We believe that the strategy is also part of Hyatt’s plan to leapfrog competitors like Marriott (MAR  -  Free Report), Wyndham  and Hilton (HLT  -  Free Report) in the race to expand in untapped markets.Loyalty Program Eyes at Top-Line GrowthSuccessful innovation has been a trademark of Hyatt, with a commitment to customer-friendly services in both the large-scale convention and smaller leisure markets. By expansion of its loyalty program beyond traditional hotel stays, Hyatt is trying to facilitate greater guest engagement in home spaces that would eventually raise occupancy. The company has been devising newer ways to enhance its guest loyalty program. In fact, it is already witnessing a higher level of guest satisfaction due to the enhancement of World of Hyatt. As of Dec 31, 2017, the loyalty program had over 10 million active members. During 2017, approximately 30% of total system-wide room nights were favored by the program.Hyatt believes that enhanced guest experience would drive occupancy, which in turn would favor its top line. By building a substantial demand from offering select services to guests and expanding units, the company is trying to facilitate revenue per available room (RevPAR) growth. In fact, for 2018, the company expects to grow units, on a net room basis, by roughly 6% to 6.5%, reflecting 60 new hotel openings.Zacks RankHyatt carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

435,HLT,"Hyatt Hotels Corporation’s (H  -  Free Report) differentiated brand portfolio, strong expansion plans and acquisition strategies are encouraging. However, substantial international presence makes the company vulnerable to macroeconomic conditions and negative currency translation.Recently, Hyatt reported better-than-expected results for the fourth quarter of 2017, wherein both earnings and revenues surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. In the last reported quarter, Hyatt’s aggressive expansion strategies in both domestic and international markets were well reflected in the top-line picture, whereas comparable owned and leased margin contraction affected the bottom line.Expansion & Other Initiatives to Drive SalesApart from owning widely recognized, industry-leading brands, an essential aspect of Hyatt’s riveting growth potential is its continual expansion of both full-service and select-service hotels. The continual expansion helps the company gain greater market share, aiding the top line.The company is trying to expand its presence worldwide and has expansion plans in Asia-Pacific, Europe, Africa, Middle East and Latin America. In fact, for 2018, the company expects to grow units, on a net rooms basis, by roughly 6-6.5%, reflecting 60 new hotel openings.Hyatt strongly believes that the opportunity for properties that offer a select offering of services at a lower price than full-service hotels is particularly compelling in certain markets, including India, China and the Middle East. This is because there is a large and growing middle-class population in these markets along with significant number of local business travelers.In order to raise occupancy by enhancing guest experience, Hyatt is also devising newer ways like innovation of food and beverage at its hotels worldwide, and creation of profitable and popular venues that build demand for hotels.To this end, in first-quarter 2017, the company launched a new loyalty program, World of Hyatt, replacing its Gold Passport loyalty program. As of Dec 31, 2017, the loyalty program had over 10 million active members. During 2017, approximately 30% of total systemwide room nights were favored by the program.Meanwhile, the Hyatt Credit Card, a co-branded Visa credit card between Hyatt and Chase Card Services, continues to show strong growth in card member acquisitions and member engagement.Acquisitions & Divestitures as Growth Strategies Hyatt is strongly invested in the strategies related to various acquisitions and divestitures that can drive growth for the company. In January 2017, the company acquired Miraval Group, which extended the Hyatt brand beyond traditional hotel stays into a wellness category that resonates well with high-end travelers.Additionally, Hyatt is also focusing on the sale of assets. On Nov 9, 2017, Hyatt sold its 550-rommed Hyatt Regency Monterey Hotel and Spa for approximately $60 million. This resulted in a pre-tax gain of approximately $17 million. Notably, this property sale was one of the six asset sales planned by the company.These strategies are in line with Hyatt’s efforts to strengthen its financial flexibility and focus more on core operation. The sale of assets is helping the company grow through management and licensing arrangements, instead of direct ownership of selective assets. Notably, a higher concentration of franchise fees reduces earnings volatility and provides a more stable growth profile. Additionally, asset sales are helping Hyatt in terms of strengthening its liquidity. This also allows the company to protect its current liabilities with a combination of cash and liquid assets.Concern of Considerable International ExposureHyatt has considerable international presence, which makes it vulnerable to economic conditions in the region.Since the company’s operations outside the United States represent approximately 20% of net revenues in 2017, the costs of complying with laws, regulations and policies (including taxation policies) of foreign governments relating to investments and operations, may affect the company’s profitability. Also, volatility in exchange rates is likely to hurt results as it has been doing over the past few quarters. Notably, the company has been witnessing a decline in international inbound travel, given a stronger dollar.Competition Remains a ChallengeThe hotel industry is highly competitive, as major hospitality chains with well-established and recognized brands are continuously expanding their global presence. Hyatt is continuously facing intense competition from both large hotel chains like Marriott (MAR  -  Free Report) and Hilton (HLT  -  Free Report), and smaller independent local hospitality providers.Increasingly, the company also faces competition from new channels of distribution in the travel industry. Additional sources of competition include large companies that offer online travel services as part of their business model such as Alibaba (BABA  -  Free Report), search engines such as Google and peer-to-peer inventory sources that allow travelers to book stays on websites, facilitating short-term rental homes and apartments from owners, thereby providing an alternative to hotel rooms, such as Airbnb and HomeAway.Unless Hyatt counters these competitions with appropriate strategies, it may pose a concern to the company’s future profitability.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

437,HLT,"Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (HLT  -  Free Report), through a strategic partnership with Country Garden Hotels Group, is lining up new hotel openings. The Country Garden properties under this agreement will be managed by Hilton’s DoubleTree by Hilton and Hilton Garden Inn brands. Hilton’s partnership with Country Garden, China’s largest property developer will enable the brand to strengthen its hold in China.In fact, the move is in line with Hilton’s strategic efforts to capitalize the flourishing tourism and leisure industry in China. Per a report by World Tourism Economy, the number of inbound tourist arrivals in China increased to 11.88 billion in 2017 compared with 11.12 billion in 2016 and the upside trend is likely to continue in 2018 as well.Hilton has a portfolio of 470 properties, either operating or under construction in China. In April, the hotelier further expanded its presence in the country by opening Hampton by Hilton Shunde Longjiang, Foshan and the Hampton by Hilton Suzhou Xiangcheng District.Continual Expansion as Major Growth DriverThe recent move underscores Hilton’s expansion strategy that is expected to put the company on a continued growth trajectory.

For 2018, the company projects an approximate 6.5% net unit growth. It also continues to have more rooms under construction in Europe, the Middle East and Asia Pacific than any other hotel chain. The company expects greater international expansion in 2018.Hilton’s broad geographic diversity lowers the effect of volatility in individual markets. Evidently, Mexico and Canada have been experiencing strong leisure demand, leading to solid RevPAR growth. Meanwhile, strength in China and Japan have led to solid RevPAR growth in the Asia Pacific region as well. Notably, the company continues to make great progress in its luxury development strategy, anticipating double-digit luxury growth in the next several years. Hilton’s new brands including Home2 Suites, Tru by Hilton and Tapestry Collection are also gaining momentum globally.Expansion Fends Off CompetitionHilton’s relentless expansion also helps the company in strategizing against a growing competition in the industry.

We believe that Marriott is poised to grow on the back of the Starwood acquisition, arresting brand position, an increased demand for travel and significant international exposure.In a year’s time, shares of Marriott have rallied a whopping 62.3% outperforming the industry’s 40.4% gain.Let’s delve deeper to find out the factors likely to have a bearing on the company’s fourth-quarter results.RevPAR & MarginsIn the quarter under review, revenue per available room (RevPAR) for worldwide comparable system-wide properties increased 4.6% in constant dollar (up 5.3% in actual dollars) driven by 1.8% growth in occupancy and 2% improvement in average daily rate (ADR). In fact, the reported figure came above management’s guided range of an increase of 2% to 3% on a constant dollar basis.Comparable system-wide RevPAR in North America grew 3.9% in constant dollars (up 4.1% in actual dollars). Occupancy rate and ADR also witnessed an increase of 1.5% and 1.7%, respectively. Management had expected the same to rise in the 2-3% band on a constant-dollar basis.In constant dollar, international comparable system-wide RevPAR rose 6.2% (up 8.4% in actual dollars). Both occupancy rate and ADR witnessed a rise of 2.4% and 2.7%, respectively. Also, the figure came above management’s guided range of 3% to 5% on a constant-dollar basis.Notably, worldwide comparable company-operated house profit margin increased 80 basis points (bps) for full year 2017. The uptick was owing to higher RevPAR, solid cost controls, improved productivity and synergies from the Starwood acquisition. North American comparable company-operated house profit margins improved 40 bps as well. Meanwhile, house profit margins for comparable company-operated properties outside North America rose 130 bps.Total adjusted expenses increased 7.5% year over year to $5.2 billion mainly owing to higher general, administrative and other expenses.General, administrative and other expenses were $259 million, up 10.7% from the year-ago quarter. The figure was also above management’s projected range of $240 million to $245 million.Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) was $808 million, up 7% year over year.First-Quarter 2018 OutlookMarriott plans to adopt Accounting Standards Update 2014-09, a new revenue standard, in the first quarter of 2018. Considering significant changes upon adoption of the new standard and migration to a single financial reporting platform, the company has provided a condensed guidance for the quarter. It will resume providing fulsome guidance from the second quarter of 2018.Marriott expects comparable system-wide RevPAR to be flat to up 2% (on a constant-dollar basis) in North America and 1% to 3% worldwide. The guidance for fourth-quarter RevPAR growth in North America reflects the shift of the Easter holiday. Outside North America, the company expects the same to rise in the range of 3% to 5%.The company anticipates realizing roughly $45 million gain in the quarter, resulting from the sale of the Sheraton Buenos Aires Hotel & Convention Center and Park Tower, a Luxury Collection Hotel.2018 ViewTaking in to account the impacts of the new revenue standard, Marriott anticipates earnings in the band of $5.11 to $5.34 per share. The midpoint of the guided range is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.16.Comparable system-wide RevPAR is expected to increase 1-2% in North America, 3-5% outside North America and improve 1-3% worldwide on a constant-dollar basis. While the company anticipates gross room additions of roughly 7%, room deletions are expected to lie between 1% and 1.5% for 2018.Additionally, Marriott projects fee revenues between $3,535 million and $3,620 million including $360 million to $380 million of credit card branding fees. Incentive management fees are anticipated to increase at a low-single digit rate from $607 million in 2017.While operating income is anticipated in the range of $2,590 million to $2,695 million, general, administrative and other expenses are envisioned in the $935 million to $945 million band.Adjusted EBITDA is projected between $3,315 million and $3,420 million.

441,HLT,"Launched on 07/13/2009, the ProShares Large Cap Core Plus (CSM  -  Free Report) is a smart beta exchange traded fund offering broad exposure to the Hedge Fund ETFs category of the U.S. equity market.What Are Smart Beta ETFs?The ETF industry has traditionally been dominated by products based on market capitalization weighted indexes that are designed to represent the market or a particular segment of the market.Investors who believe in market efficiency should consider market cap indexes, as they replicate market returns in a low-cost, convenient, and transparent way.On the other hand, some investors who believe that it is possible to beat the market by superior stock selection opt to invest in another class of funds that track non-cap weighted strategies--popularly known as smart beta.By attempting to pick stocks that have a better chance of risk-return performance, non-cap weighted indexes are based on certain fundamental characteristics, or a combination of such.This area offers many different investment choices, such as simplest equal-weighting, fundamental weighting and volatility/momentum based weighting methodologies; however, not all of these strategies can deliver superior results.Fund Sponsor & IndexCSM is managed by Profunds Group, and this fund has amassed over $759.01 M, which makes it the largest ETF in the Hedge Fund ETFs. CSM seeks to match the performance of the Credit Suisse 130/30 Large Cap Index before fees and expenses.The Credit Suisse 130/30 Large-Cap Index is designed to replicate an investment strategy that establishes either long or short positions in certain of the 500 largest U.S. market cap equities by applying a rules-based ranking and weighting methodology detailed below. The design intends to provide an indexed representation of a quantitatively constructed 130/30 U.S. large-cap equity strategy.Cost & Other ExpensesWhen considering an ETF's total return, expense ratios are an important factor. And, cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive cousins in the long term if all other factors remain equal.Annual operating expenses for CSM are 0.45%, which makes it the least expensive product in the space.It's 12-month trailing dividend yield comes in at 1.28%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsETFs offer diversified exposure and thus minimize single stock risk, but it is still important to delve into a fund's holdings before investing. Most ETFs are very transparent products and many disclose their holdings on a daily basis.CSM's heaviest allocation is in the Information Technology sector, which is about 18.30% of the portfolio. Its Consumer Discretionary and Financials round out the top three.Performance and RiskCSM has lost about -0.02% so far this year, and as of 04/05/2018, is up about 15.78% in the last one year. In the past 52-week period, the fund has traded between $57.63 and $71.30.The fund has a beta of 1.01 and standard deviation of 13.49% for the trailing three-year period.

442,HLT,"Hyatt Hotels Corporation’s (H  -  Free Report) The Unbound Collection by Hyatt brand offers a portfolio of upper-upscale and luxury build hotels, boutique properties, and resorts. The brand, which is swiftly gaining momentum, recently marked its entry in Turkey with the opening of a 45-roomed boutique hotel called Nish Palas Istanbul. Featuring the city’s historic and cultural attributes, the hotel, like all other Hyatt hotels, will provide guests with high-class experiences.The recent addition of the hotel is in line with an essential aspect of Hyatt’s riveting growth potential that focuses on its strong brand presence and continual expansion strategies. Also, shares of Hyatt have rallied 39% in the past year, outperforming the industry’s growth of 23.5%.Market Share Expansion, Top-Line GrowthHyatt’s continuous efforts toward expanding its brands globally should help it increase its market share. Hyatt is focused on expanding its presence worldwide and capitalizing on demand for hotels in profitable but relatively untapped international markets. In fact, other than Europe and Asia Pacific, the company also has expansion plans for Africa, the Middle East and Latin America. Notably, courtesy of its aggressive expansion efforts, the company’s hotel opening agreements have continually outpaced its actual openings and this trend is expected to continue in the near future as well. The company has experienced net room growth between 6% and 7% for 10 consecutive quarters. In fact, for 2018, the company expects to grow units, on a net rooms basis, by roughly 6-6.5%, reflecting 60 new hotel openings.Further, we expect the recent launch to boost Hyatt’s Owned and Leased Hotels revenues. The performance of the segment was slightly weak in the last reported quarter. Revenues were down 2.5% year over year. However, comparable Owned and Leased hotels RevPAR increased 5.4% from the prior-year quarter.Countering CompetitionWe believe that by expanding its brands globally, Hyatt is trying to fend off competition from the likes of Marriott (MAR  -  Free Report), Wyndham  and Hilton (HLT  -  Free Report). As it is, the hotel industry is highly competitive, as major hospitality chains with their well-established and recognized brands are continuously expanding their global presence. Hyatt is continuously facing intense competition from both large hotel chains and smaller independent local hospitality providers. Unless this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company counters these competitions with appropriate strategies, it may lose out on market share.

443,HLT,"Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc.’s (HLT  -  Free Report) relentless expansion strategies, coupled with an asset-light business model and a strong loyalty program put the company on growth trajectory amid a competitive industry. In first-quarter 2018, Hilton reported better-than-expected earnings for the sixth straight quarter. The bottom line increased 44.7% on a year-over-year basis.Improving economic indicators, along with elevated demand for leisure and business travel are also helping Hilton to gain traction. Driven by a robust brand image, Hilton’s shares have gained 34.8% in the past year, outperforming the industry’s rally of 24.8%.Unit Expansion & Loyalty Program Continue to Drive Top Line In a bid to maintain its position as the fastest-growing global hospitality company, Hilton is continuing to drive unit growth. In 2017, Hilton witnessed net unit growth of 18,400 rooms. Also, in the first quarter of 2018, the company achieved net unit growth of 7,100 rooms and witnessed a 7% increase from the prior-year quarter. For 2018, the company projects an approximate 6.5% net unit growth. It also continues to have more rooms under construction in Europe, the Middle East and Asia Pacific than any other hotel chain. The company expects greater international expansion in 2018.Expanding its footprint, Hilton is continuously trying to meet the growing demand for hotels and drive its top line. Revenues in the first quarter increased 9.4% year over year driven by the rise in rate and occupancy, as well as robust demand at the company’s international hotels.Meanwhile, Hilton has created one of the largest loyalty programs, Hilton Honors. With about 74 million members, this network has created an extremely valuable asset for the company. In 2017, the company added in excess of 11 million members to the program. Also, in the first quarter of 2018, more than 3 million members were added to Hilton Honors. The company continues to make multiple enhancements to its loyalty program in order to make it the most customer-centric program, driving incremental value for guests and the overall system, thereby driving revenues.Capital-Light Business Model to Boost Shareholders’ ReturnsHilton has transformed into a capital-light operating business, backed by the spin-off of a portfolio of hotels and resorts, as well as its timeshare business. This asset-light model is expected to allow shareholders to receive high returns on invested capital. In fact, in the first quarter, the company repurchased 1.3 million shares of its common stock for roughly $110 million, at an average price per share of $84.01. The company aims to strengthen its shareholders’ value through regular dividend payment and buybacks, going forward. This reinstates our faith in the company’s strong fundamentals and cash-flow position.Intense Competition Remains a HeadwindThe hotel industry is highly competitive as major hospitality chains, along with their well-established and recognized brands are continuously expanding their global presence. Hilton is continuously facing intense competition from large hotel chains like Marriott (MAR  -  Free Report) and Hyatt (H  -  Free Report), as well as smaller independent local hospitality providers.Increasingly, the company also faces competition from new channels of distribution in the travel industry. Additional sources of competition include large companies that offer online travel services as part of their business model such as Alibaba (BABA  -  Free Report), search engines such as Google, and peer-to-peer inventory sources such as Airbnb and HomeAway, allowing travelers to book stays on websites that facilitate the short-term rental homes and apartments from owners, thereby providing an alternative to hotel rooms.Also, compared with other big hotel chains, Hilton is seen to have a lower mix of luxury and upper upscale rooms. An increasing supply of such upscale hotels may not have a rewarding impact on Hilton. Unless this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company develops its luxury portfolio alongside other rooms, it has a good chance of losing out on the emerging demand.

444,HLT,"Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (HLT  -  Free Report) is currently one of the top-performing stocks in the hotel space. This is quite evident from the company’s share price movement and strong fundamentals.Therefore, if you haven’t taken advantage of the share price appreciation yet, it’s time you add the stock to your portfolio.Why an Attractive Pick?Price Performance: A look at Hilton’s price trend reveals that the stock has witnessed an impressive run on the bourse last year. The company has returned 40.2%, massively outperforming the S&P 500’s gain of 15.4%. The price surge was owing to investor’s optimism surrounding the stock, given that Hilton’s scale, size, commercial platform, industry-leading brands and solid loyalty program continue to drive growth. In fact, it is also considered to be one of the fastest growing global hospitality company (on an organic basis), with presence in 105 countries and territories.Also, Hilton continues to make immense progress in its luxury development strategy, anticipating double-digit luxury growth for the next several years. Additionally, the company’s new brands — Home2 Suites, Tru by Hilton, Tapestry Collection — are gaining momentum globally.Furthermore, the company has created one of the largest loyalty programs, Hilton Honors. With about 71 million members, this network has created an extremely valuable asset for the Hilton. In fact, about 57% of all occupancy per night takes place through this member program.In the meantime, innovations such as the Hilton Honors app continue to drive growth of the program. Apart from being the company’s fastest growing and lowest cost distribution channel, this app offers a differentiated customer experience. We believe that large market share gains lie ahead for Hilton, given encouraging demand for hotels in the United States.Solid Rank & Momentum Score: Hilton carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Also, the company has outperformed the industry in the 52-week time frame, leading to a Momentum Score of A. Thus, indicating that the stock has robust fundamentals to outperform in the near term.Northward Estimate Revisions: Nine estimates for 2018 moved north in the past 60 days versus no southward revisions, reflecting analysts’ confidence in the company. Over the same period, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year climbed 15.9%.We believe Hilton’s capital-light business model will continue to drive market share, units, free cash flow as well as maintain the company's strong balance sheet and accelerating earnings and return of capital.In fact, Hilton transformed into a capital-light operating business backed by the spin-offs of a portfolio of hotels and resorts as well as its timeshare business. Post-spin off, the company is a resilient, fee-driven business with a disciplined strategy.Positive Earnings Surprise History: Hilton has an impressive earnings surprise history. Evidently, the company outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, delivering a positive average earnings surprise of 18.6%. Given solid expansion efforts to boost growth, the stock seems to have decent upside potential.Strong Growth Prospects: Arguably, earnings growth is of utmost importance for determining a stock’s potential as surging profit levels often indicate solid prospects (and stock price gains). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 earnings of $2.62 reflects year-over-year growth of 31%. Additionally, the stock has long-term earnings growth rate of 5.3%.Notably, this strong earnings growth prospect is justified, given the company’s strong hotel performance and non-RevPAR driven fees.Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc.

Nevertheless, total revenues of $2,074 million missed the consensus mark of $2,255.3 million but were up 9.4% from the year-ago quarter.

The improvement was driven by growth in occupancy and average daily rate (ADR).

450,HLT,"Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (HLT  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 numbers on Apr 26, before market open.The hotelier’s aggressive expansion strategies and industry leading loyalty program are expected to have majorly aided revenues in the first quarter. Moreover, a capital-light business model, efficient cost management and steady revenue per available room growth (ReVPAR) are expected to reflect in the company’s earnings in the to-be-reported quarter.Also, Hilton’s remarkable scale, size, commercial platform and industry-leading brands have helped the company show impressive price performance. The company's shares have rallied 41.9%, outperforming the industry’s gain of 30.9%.Let’s find out how Hilton’s first-quarter results will shape up.Top Line to Grow on Expansion Strategies & Loyalty ProgramThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues in the first quarter is pegged at $2.26 billion, reflecting 4.4% year-over-year growth. In 2017, the company witnessed revenue growth of 23.8% from 2016 and the upside trend is likely to continue in the first quarter as well. Moreover, for the to-be-reported quarter, management expects system-wide RevPAR to witness a year-over-year increase of 1-3% on a comparable and currency-neutral basis.The consensus estimate for the same is pegged at $102 million. Also, for the to-be-reported quarter, the company expects its management and franchise fee revenues to increase in the band of 8-10% year over year.This prospective growth is attributable to the company’s relentless expansion strategies and a strong loyalty program. In a bid to maintain its position as the fastest-growing global hospitality company, Hilton is continuing to drive unit growth. In 2017, Hilton witnessed net unit growth of 18,400 rooms. Further, the company expanded its footprint across new countries totaling 105 countries and territories. For 2018, the company projects an approximate 6.5% net unit growth. It also continues to have more rooms under construction in Europe, the Middle East and Asia Pacific than any other hotel chain.Meanwhile, Hilton has created one of the largest loyalty programs, Hilton Honors. With about 71 million members, this network has created an extremely valuable asset for the company. In 2017, the company added more than 11 million members to the program. The company continues to make multiple enhancements to its loyalty program in order to make it the most customer-centric program, driving incremental value for guests and the overall system, thereby driving revenues.Earnings Likely to See GrowthHilton saw adjusted EBITDA to grow 11% to $1,965 million in 2017, compared with $1,763 million in 2016. The positive trend is likely to continue in the first quarter as well since management posted adjusted EBITDA in the $410-$430 million band.The company’s margins are benefited by strong ReVPAR growth and efficient cost control. Also, a capital-light business model allows the company to receive a greater return on lesser invested capital. This is additionally a riveting factor for Hilton’s profits to grow.Subsequently, the consensus estimate pegs earnings in the first quarter at 50 cents, suggesting 31.6% year-over-year growth. This exceeds the company’s expected earnings in the range of 43-47 cents per share for the to-be-reported quarter.Our Quantitative Model Predicts a BeatHilton has the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.Zacks ESP: The company has an Earnings ESP of +3.09%.

451,HLT,"Marriott International, Inc. (MAR  -  Free Report) announced its plans to unify its loyalty program benefits across Marriott Rewards, The Ritz-Carlton Rewards and Starwood Preferred Guest (SPG) in August. The combined loyalty program is expected to provide richer perks to the company’s loyalty members by enabling them to earn roughly 20% points for every dollar spent. The new loyalty program will also enrich members with more than what was offered under the prior programs.Under this global loyalty program, members can book stays, and earn or redeem points across 29 brands covering 6,500 hotels in 127 countries and territories. Additionally, the company’s newly launched Marriott Moments, allowing guests to shop for and book unique experiences, will also undergo expansion under the unified program.Moreover, the loyalty program will facilitate members with the option of earning status based on room nights, with the highest level of status requiring $20,000 in annual spending. Membership status can also be heightened using co-branded credit cards with American Express Co. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report).Notably, shares of Marriott have rallied 45% in the past year, outperforming the industry’s gain of 31.6%.Loyalty Programs a Big Hit Among HoteliersThe move underscores Marriott’s aggressive expansion of its loyalty base, with which it aims to meet guest expectations, while driving hotel profitability for owners and franchisees. Notably, loyalty programs have proved to be effective in raising occupancy and driving revenues for hotel companies, as major bigwigs like Hyatt (H  -  Free Report) and Hilton (HLT  -  Free Report) are all aggressively looking to enhance their loyalty programs.Marriott has also recognized its loyalty program as the most powerful marketing platform, and thus continues to invest in marketing partnerships and innovations to provide a more rewarding experience to the guests. The company’s leading loyalty programs leverage its distribution, driving guest preference and significant revenue per available room (RevPAR) index premiums.Other Initiatives by Marriott to Build LoyaltyDigital innovations and social media are starting to play an increasingly important role in hotel bookings. Social media enhances the brand’s prospects by connecting directly with guests, which in turn can lead to increased loyalty and market share. The Marriott mobile app for tablets and smartphones helps guests to manage their bookings, access interactive maps/GPS as well as reward programs. Moreover, Marriott recently re-imagined its Marriott Mobile app to meet the needs of modern world travelers. Its guests will now be able to enjoy new and extended digital features, customized travel content, easier one-button navigation and a new swipe-able discovery home screen.Moreover, the company has rolled out guestVoice to measure guests’ feedback, introduced SPG Mobile check-in and check-out in North America, and achieved procurement and OTA cost savings.Additionally, MLive, real-time marketing brand newsroom and social media command center are worth mentioning. Through this media source, the company addresses travel issues, special events, trending topics and is busy expanding MLive globally.Marriott carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) Rank stocks here.Breaking News: Cryptocurrencies Now Bigger than VisaThe total market cap of all cryptos recently surpassed $700 billion – more than a 3,800% increase in the previous 12 months.

452,HLT,"Pool Corporation (POOL  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 19, before market opens.The company’s robust market presence along with favorable consumer discretionary spending are expected to reflect in the to-be-reported quarter’s revenues. Moreover, despite high cost of sales, Pool Corp’s focus on margin expansion through simplification in business is expected to have benefited its first-quarter earnings.Over the past six months, the company’s shares have rallied 31.1% compared with the industry’s gain of 12.4%.Let’s find out how the company’s to-be-reported quarter’s results will turn out.Robust Brand Presence & Strategic Expansion to Favor Top LinePool Corp achieved year-over-year growth in sales for the 30th consecutive quarter in fourth-quarter 2017. For the full year of 2017, net sales increased 8% year over year. The trend is expected to continue in the to-be-reported quarter as well, backed by solid business sales growth and favorable trends in the housing market.Furthermore, the company’s leading market share position and opportunistic expansion strategies are likely to propel top-line growth. Also, continuous growth in the remodel and replacement sectors of business is a major positive. In addition, stronger consumer discretionary spending is expected to have driven continued growth in new pool construction. The company’s existing pool business witnessed revenue growth throughout 2015, 2016 and 2017, mainly aided by higher replacement activities, and the trend is expected to prevail, going forward.Subsequently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues in the first quarter is pegged at $586.7 million, reflecting 7.4% year-over-year growth.Margin Expansion Efforts & Strong Shareholders’ Return to Drive EarningsDespite facing increased expenses from labor, delivery and investments in information technology systems and hardware, Pool Corp focused on improving its expense management in each quarter throughout 2017 and as a result, witnessed a year-over-year expansion in its operating margin by 20 basis points (bps) for the full year. Gross margin in 2017 also increased 10 bps in 2017.Moreover, the company shows strong commitment toward returning more value to shareholders Recently, Pool Corp expanded its share-repurchase program by $150 million. The share-repurchase initiatives reflect the company’s confidence in its fundamentals. At the same time, the buybacks will help it to reduce outstanding share count, thereby increasing its earnings per share. Such healthy capital deployment initiatives would also boost investors’ confidence in the stock.In fact, in 2017, Pool Corp witnessed its earnings to grow 15% year over year, which we believe will continue to rise in the to-be-reported quarter. Subsequently, the consensus estimate for earnings in the first quarter is pegged at 70 cents, reflecting 75% growth from the year-ago quarter.Our Quantitative Model Does Not Predict a BeatPool Corp does not have the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.Zacks ESP: The company has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%.

453,HLT,"Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc.’s (HLT  -  Free Report) upper-midscale brand, Hampton by Hilton, announced the launch of nine properties. Notably, these new properties were launched both domestically and internationally.Noteworthy properties include Hampton Inn & Suites by Hilton Detroit/Warren in Michigan, Hampton Inn & Suites by Hilton St. George in Utah and Hampton by Hilton Dortmund Phoenix See in Germany. The brand also proliferated its presence in China by the addition of Hampton by Hilton Shunde Longjiang, and Foshan and Hampton by Hilton Suzhou Xiangcheng District. The company also expanded its presence in Massachusetts, California, Oklahoma and Canada.We observe that shares of Hilton have rallied 40% in the past year, outperforming the industry’s gain of 32%.Continual Expansion in FocusThe move underscores Hilton’s absolute focus to aggressively expand its brands in both domestic and international markets. To maintain its position as the fastest-growing global hospitality company, Hilton is continuing to drive unit growth.In 2017, Hilton witnessed net unit growth of 18,400 rooms. Further, the company expanded its footprint across new countries for a total of 105 countries and territories. For 2018, the company projects an approximate 6.5% net unit growth. It also continues to have more rooms under construction in Europe, the Middle East and Asia Pacific than any other hotel chain. The company expects greater international expansion in 2018.Geographic Diversity Aids RevPAR GrowthHilton continues to look for expansion in its geographic footprint, as diversity lowers the effect of volatility in individual markets. Evidently, Mexico and Canada have been experiencing strong leisure demand, leading to solid revenue per available room (RevPAR) growth. Further, Europe’s RevPAR trends are being supported by favorable exchange rates as well as strength in regions including Spain, the United Kingdom, Germany, Turkey and others. Meanwhile, strength in China and Japan have led to solid RevPAR growth in the Asia Pacific region as well.Enhancing Customer LoyaltyThe new hotels by Hampton also seem to be part of Hilton’s bid to enhance customer loyalty, more so because the brand is a component of Hilton Honors, one of the largest loyalty programs. With about 71 million members, this network has emerged as a highly valuable asset for the company. The company is focused on making multiple enhancements to its loyalty program in order to make it more customer centric, driving incremental value for guests and the overall system.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderHilton carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the hotel space include Hilton Grand Vacations (HGV  -  Free Report), Marriott Vacations Worldwide (VAC  -  Free Report) and Wyndham Worldwide .

454,HLT,"The prevailing dispute between the United States and China Trade threaten to wreak most markets that are sensitive to business cycle fluctuations. The hospitality industry therefore might not be able to survive the effects of a trade clash. The hotel space, which largely depends on consumer discretionary spending, is constantly apprehensive about a trade war dampening consumer confidence.It is also to be noted that President Trump’s stringent policies have made United States a somewhat less popular tourist destination. Per the UN World Tourism Organization, United States reported a 2% decline in foreign tourist count in 2017.However, there are a few factors backing hotel stocks amid the turmoil. Let’s take a look.Why Trade Disputes Might Not be as HarrowingPer the U.S. Travel Association, a large part of employment in the United States is directly reliant on tourism. Travel industry added 3,900 jobs in March after the robust 8,400 addition in February..Moreover, per the official data, Chinese tourism accounted for $33 billion spending in the United States in 2016. Further, U.S. National Travel and Tourism Office forecasts tourist count to reach 4.5 million by 2022.  China’s outbound tourism is currently growing around 6% per year, with predictions of more than 200 million Chinese traveling overseas by 2022.Although a brewing trade war might deal a blow to United States’ tourist numbers from China, it wouldn’t be very severe as the major beneficiaries of Chinese tourism in America are democratic states such as California, Illinois, Massachusetts and New York.Also, a rivalry that can affect tourism and hospitality industry goes against China’s business interest. This is because a number of its tour agencies, tour companies and airlines have huge holdings in the United States. Even U.S. tour operators are linked with large hoteliers who have significant hold in China.Given this scenario, the countries might not want to put their tourism industry at stake by waging a trade war.US Hotels to Sustain Modest GrowthDespite the challenges, we see no reason why the U.S. hotel industry should not continue to gain on both the top and the bottom line. The domestic economy, currently, is favorable for hospitality companies. The overall economy shows increased consumer demand for goods and services. According to the Fed’s latest forecast, the economy will grow at a reasonable rate of 2.7% in 2018. Unemployment is predicted at 3.8% for 2018 versus the current 4.1%. Moreover, high real disposable income and low inflation are resulting in the higher purchasing behavior. The fourth quarter of 2017 saw the highest consumer spending after three years.Moreover, a strong economy, higher income and increased consumer confidence have driven demand for both leisure and business travel. The supply-demand environment in the United States has been favorable since 2010, with growth in demand outpacing supply growth.Given the positive economic outlook for the remainder of the year, which could result in the ninth successive year of occupancy growth for the U.S. lodging industry, PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) expects demand (2.1% rise) to outpace supply (increase of 1.9%) in 2018. Moreover, per a report by Deloitte, the hotel industry is estimated to sustain a strong 5% to 6% growth throughout 2018.Also, the Zacks Hotels and Motels industry has rallied 32% in the past year, outperforming the S&P 500 market’s 14.7%.Initiatives Adopted by Bigwigs EncourageIn order to capitalize on the growing demand for hotels and leisure, top hoteliers like Marriot International (MAR  -  Free Report), Hilton (HLT  -  Free Report) and Hyatt (H  -  Free Report) are continuously opting for ways to provide highest consumer satisfaction. By moving toward launching more lifestyle hotels, these operators are increasingly targeting consumers more concerned about health, convenience, service and ethical sourcing of food, who also form a significant part of the population.Embracing digital innovations and loyalty programs, these hotel bigwigs are relentlessly expanding their customer base and market share. Many hoteliers are also setting up analytics tools to understand consumer preferences and deliver a differentiated experience, which could eventually motivate customers to visit frequently, stay longer and spend more.These, therefore, are a few reasons why the broader hotel space should continue doing well in both the short and medium term.Picking the Right StocksWe have taken the help of Zacks Stock Screener to pick hotel stocks which carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). These stocks are expected to see significant earnings growth in 2018. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Hilton Grand Vacations Inc.

456,HLT,"Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc.  (HLT  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter numbers on Feb 14, before market opens.Relentless expansion and efforts to fortify global presence make Hilton a major hotelier, which is continuously gaining momentum and is set to become the world's largest hospitality company.However, significant international presence makes the company vulnerable to global economic conditions and currency translation.We note that the stock has rallied 30.3% in the last six months, significantly outperforming the industry’s gain of 27.2%.Let’s find out what is in store for Hilton in the to-be-reported quarter.Currency Translation Likely to Dent EarningsThe consensus estimate predicts earnings of 44 cents for the fourth quarter, suggesting a 37.1% decline from the year-ago quarter. Hilton’s guided range for fourth-quarter earnings was 41 cents to 45 cents.The company’s significant international presence exposes it to fluctuations in exchange rates which may hurt earnings in the to-be-reported quarter. Since, Hilton’s net income is mostly sourced from foreign subsidiaries and franchisees, its bottom line may remain under pressure, given a stronger dollar.Top-Line Forecast BleakThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $2.26 billion, reflecting a 22.6% year-over-year decline. We believe that this projected revenue decline is due to weak anticipated revenue per available room (RevPAR) growth.In the United States, RevPAR growth is being dented by softer group performance and weakness in oil and gas markets, despite good leisure transient trends. In fact, the company continues to forecast U.S. RevPAR growth toward the low half of its 1%-3% system-wide range. The consensus estimate for fourth-quarter RevPAR is pegged at $100 million, same as the year-ago quarter. It is also likely to decline 13.8% from the prior quarter.In the Middle East, political unrest, lower government spending and increased hotel supply continue to hurt tourism. In fact, for 2017, the company expects RevPAR growth to be flat to slightly positive in the region. Also, a cooling Chinese economy might hurt discretionary spending as well as travel. Further, business conditions in Europe are plagued by economic uncertainties in the northern region and deflation in the Eurozone.Our Quantitative Model Predicts a BeatHilton has the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.Zacks ESP: The company has an Earnings ESP of +0.13%.

457,HLT,"Potbelly Corporation (PBPB  -  Free Report) is expected to release fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 13.While we expect the company to record an increase in revenues driven by unit growth and sales initiatives, comps are likely to decline, given weak consumer demand coupled with food inflation.We observe that shares of Potbelly have depreciated 8.5% over the last year against the industry’s gain of 8.5%. A challenging operating environment in the U.S. restaurants space has been affecting the company.Revenues Likely to Grow Driven by Unit GrowthThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues in the to-be-reported quarter is pegged at $112 million, reflecting an increase of 9.8% when compared with the year-ago actual figure. In the third quarter, the company reported revenues of $106 million, up 2% year over year.We expect new unit growth to contribute significantly to the anticipated top-line surge. The company is focusing on moderating company operated unit growth while accelerating franchised unit growth.Potbelly Corporation Revenue (TTM) Potbelly Corporation Revenue (TTM) | Potbelly Corporation QuoteThe consensus estimate for the number of franchised units at the end of the fourth quarter stands at 58, reflecting year-over-year growth of 34.9%. The number of company operated units is anticipated to be up 20.7%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at 496.Apart from net unit growth, various sales boosting initiatives such as improved digital innovation, distinguished menu offerings and advertising and marketing strategies are likely to contribute toward the anticipated top-line growth.Comps to Stay Under Pressure Potbelly has been bearing the brunt of a challenging operating environment in the U.S. restaurants space, which led to lower comps in the first nine months of 2017.

458,HLT,"Extended Stay America, Inc. (STAY  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 26, after market close.While the company’s expense containment and cost-saving measures are expected to have favored first-quarter earnings, revenues in the quarter might have been affected by a shift in Easter date. Also, limited international presence continues to be a headwind for the company’s revenues.Notably, shares of Extended Stay have gained 17% in the past year, underperforming the industry’s growth of 30.9% in the same time period.Let’s discuss the factors that are likely to influence the company’s first-quarter results.Efficient Cost Management to Favor EarningsExtended Stay’s operating model posits a low-cost capital structure that has low fixed and variable costs. Even though an ongoing increase in wages can substantially put pressure on the company’s expenses, its cost-saving measures are expected to have driven margins in the quarter.In 2017, Extended Stay’s operating profit increased 0.7% year over year and the trend is likely to continue in the first quarter as well. Subsequently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter earnings is pegged at 17 cents, suggesting 13.3% increase from the year-ago quarter.Tricky Top-Line ScenarioExtended Stay looks to drive its revenue per available room (ReVPAR) by providing suitable services to value-conscious business travelers. In 2017, its ReVPAR increased 1.7% from the prior-year quarter on 1.1% growth in Average Daily Rate (ADR) and 40 basis points (bps) expansion in occupancy. Management believes that this upside trend will continue in the first quarter of 2018 by 1-3%.However, the company predicts 50-75 bps negative impact on ReVPAR due to a shift in Easter date. Moreover, the company’s lack of exposure in emerging markets might limit its revenue growth potential.The consensus estimate for revenues in the first quarter is pegged at $289.78 million, reflecting a decline of 0.4% from the prior-year quarter.Our Quantitative Model Predicts a BeatExtended Stay has the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.Zacks ESP: The company has an Earnings ESP of +3.50%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Extended Stay has a Zacks Rank #3.

461,HLT,"Wyndham Worldwide Corporation  reported mixed fourth-quarter 2017 results wherein earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate while revenues lagged the same.Adjusted earnings of $1.49 per share beat the consensus estimate of $1.35 by 10.4%. Also, the bottom line was up 9.6% year over year on the back of higher revenues as well as the company’s share repurchase program, partly offset by higher interest expenses.Net revenues from continuing operations were $1.2 billion and improved 4% from the prior-year quarter on the back of increased contribution from all its segments. However, the top line lagged the consensus estimate of $1.4 billion by 14.3%.Wyndham Worldwide Corp Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Wyndham Worldwide Corp Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Wyndham Worldwide Corp QuoteWyndham had a great deal of benefit from the U.S. corporate tax reform on fourth-quarter earnings. The company’s various sales building initiatives like marketing campaigns and partnerships, digital experiences, website development, on-property amenities and travel perks to guests have favored earnings and revenues growth in the quarter. However, effects of the recent hurricanes lingered in the quarter, partially affecting both top and bottom lines.Shares of the company rallied 44.1% in the past year, outperforming the industry’s gain of 38.9%.Fourth Quarter Unit PerformancesNotably, Wyndham has been functioning through its three operating segments: Hotel Group, Destination Network (formerly known as Vacation Exchange and Rentals) and Vacation Ownership.Hotel Group revenues were $332 million, up 5% from the year-ago figure, which reflected higher franchise and royalty fees, increased pass-through marketing, reservation as well as growth in Wyndham Rewards revenues.Domestic same-store RevPAR (revenues per available room) improved 4.5%. At constant currency, global system-wide same store RevPAR increased 4.6% year over year.Adjusted EBITDA increased 3% to $102 million primarily due to revenue increases, partially offset by the impact of Hurricane Maria on the hotel in Puerto Rico.  The Destination Network no longer includes the Company's European vacation-rentals business and has been classified as a discontinued operation.Revenues at the segment were $200 million, an increase of 5% from the year-ago figure. While exchange revenues per member rose 7%, the average number of members declined 1%. The upside in exchange revenues was favored by pricing.Adjusted EBITDA increased 23% to $48 million, reflecting cost savings initiatives and favorable pricing.Revenues at Vacation Ownership increased 4% year over year to $734 million. The uptick reflects an increase in gross VOI sales as well as higher consumer financing revenues, even though hurricanes negatively impacted VOI sales in the quarter.Gross VOI sales in the fourth quarter increased 7% from the year-ago period. Meanwhile, tour flow was up 7% and volume per guest (VPG) increased 2%.Adjusted EBITDA increased 4.7% to $200 million, as higher gross VOI sales and consumer financing revenues were offset by a higher provision for loan losses.Operating HighlightsNet Income in the quarter totaled $449 million, higher than $164 million in the year-ago quarter. Total Expenses amounted to $1.1 billion in the quarter, up from $937 million in the prior-year quarter.Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations increased 5% year over year to $320 million. Results primarily reflect growth in revenues, cost containment efforts, partially offset by the hurricane impacts.Balance SheetAs of Dec 31, 2017, net cash from continuing operations was $880 million, compared with $846 million in the prior year. The increase is primarily due to higher net income.Total free cash flow (from continuing and discontinued operations) was $799 million in 2017, compared with $782 million in 2016. The company repurchased 1.4 million shares of common stock for $150 million during the quarter at an average price of $110.06. In 2017, the company repurchased 6.3 million shares of stock or 6% of shares outstanding, at a cost of $601 million.In the quarter, the company's Board of Directors authorized an increase in quarterly cash dividend to 66 cents from 58 cents per share.2017 ResultsFor 2017, revenues from continuing operations were $5.1 billion, reflecting 3% year-over-year growth. The upside was offset by higher year-over-year interest, depreciation and variable compensation expenses. The recent hurricanes also affected revenues.Adjusted EPS was $5.50 per share compared with $5.15 in 2016. The growth in adjusted EPS primarily reflected the repurchase of 6% of outstanding shares in the year.     2018 GuidanceRevenues are expected in the range of $5.26-$5.40 billion, reflecting an increase of 4-6%.Adjusted net income from continuing operations is expected within $702-$722 million. The company expects Adjusted EBITDA between $1.330 billion and $1.355 billion, reflecting year-over-year growth of 6-8%.Adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations is anticipated in the range of $6.90-$7.05 and is projected to increase 25-28% year over year.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderWyndham carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the hotel space include Choice Hotels (CHH  -  Free Report), Hilton (HLT  -  Free Report) and Marriott (MAR  -  Free Report), each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

462,HLT,"Hyatt Hotels Corporation (H  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 numbers on Feb 14, after market close.Revenues are likely to grow in the to-be-reported quarter on an aggressive expansion strategy. However, earnings are likely to have been affected in the fourth quarter.Notably, Hyatt’s shares have gained 35.5% in the past six months, outperforming the industry’s growth of 26.2%.Earnings Likely to be HurtEstimates for fourth-quarter earnings is pegged at 19 cents, reflecting a 34.5% decline from a year ago. Estimates have been stable over the last 60 days, reflecting analysts’ concerns surrounding the stock’s upside potential.The estimated earnings decline is perhaps due to an estimated comparable owned and leased margin contraction in the to-be-reported quarter. In the third quarter, comparable Owned and Leased hotels RevPAR declined 0.5% (down 1.1% at cc).Revenues to Benefit From Continuous ExpansionThe consensus estimate for fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $1.11 billion, reflecting a 2% year-over-year increase. This growth is attributable to Hyatt’s continuous efforts toward expanding its brands globally and gaining market traction. Expansion in domestic and international markets is expected to drive the company’s RevPAR and add to the overall top line in the to-be-reported quarter.Notably, courtesy of aggressive expansion efforts, the company’s hotel opening agreements have continually outpaced actual openings and this trend is expected to continue in the near future as well. The company has experienced net room growth between 6% and 7% for 10 consecutive quarters.Our Quantitative Model Does Not Predict a BeatHyatt does not have the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.Zacks ESP: The company has an Earnings ESP of -21.57%.

463,HLT,"After experiencing a strong 2017, the hotel industry is likely to enjoy another successful year. A confluence of factors is working in favor of the sector at the moment. Firstly, the economy remains strong and the labor market continues to strengthen. Also, the recent jump in yearly wage growth bears evidence of the fact that the American consumer is likely to have even greater levels of disposable levels of income over the rest of the year.According to the recently released Deloitte 2018 Travel and Hospitality Industry Outlook, the hotel industry is likely to expand by 5-6% over 2018. This is likely to result in record gross bookings of around $170 billion.In January, a report by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) indicated that a strong economy and recent tax cuts would fuel the highest rates of occupancy for the hospitality industry since 1981. According to PwC, occupancy is likely to increase to 66.1% for hotels in the United States in 2018.With Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (HLT  -  Free Report) and Marriott International Inc. (MAR  -  Free Report) both scheduled to report on Feb 14, this may be a good time to consider which of these is a better stock. Both stocks have a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Other major stocks reporting earnings on Feb 14 include Cisco Systems (CSCO  -  Free Report) and Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT  -  Free Report).Price PerformanceWhen considering price performance over the last three months, Marriott has gained 13.2%, higher than the broader industry’s 9.9% increase over the same period. On the other hand, Hilton has gained 10.8% over this period, which exceeds the broader industry’s performance but falls behind Marriott.Current RatioThe hospitality industry requires a large quantum of working capital. Additionally, it also needs to service a number of short-term financial obligations. This is why liquidity ratios are an essential component of the industry’s analysis.The current ratio measures the ability of a company to meet short-term debt obligations. In other words, it is the ratio of the current level of total assets and expresses to that of the current level of liabilities. Here, Hilton is a clear winner with a current ratio of 0.94, which is superior to the industry average of 0.72 as well as Marriott’s reading of 0.53.Debt RatioThe hospitality industry is characterized by a high level of long term debt as well as current liabilities. Such high levels of debt are required to finance, maintain and operate large cruise lines as well. Given the high proportion of long term assets, debt financing over an extended period is a necessary requirement.Since the sector has a high level of financial leverage, debt ratios naturally come into the picture. This measures the ability of a company to services long term debt. Hospitality stocks should ideally have lower debt ratios. This implies that assets are present in higher proportion compared to debt over the long term.Here Hilton is at a disadvantage with a debt ratio of 46.5%, which is higher than the industry average of 41.1%. At 35.8%, Marriott has a debt component, which is lower than both Hilton’s as well as the industry.Dividend YieldIn the last one-year period, Marriott has provided a dividend yield of 0.95%, marginally higher than the industry average of 0.94. In comparison, Hilton offers a dividend of 0.73%. Hence, on a comparable basis, Marriott shareholders earned better dividend yield than those of Hilton.ValuationThe most appropriate metric to capital-intensive companies like hotels is the EV/EBITDA multiple. This ratio helps to overcome several of the drawbacks of the P/E ratio. This is because, unlike P/E, the EV/EBITDA ratio accounts for both the debt and shareholder perspectives.With an EV/ EBITDA value of 21.6, Marriott is clearly overvalued compared with the industry which as an EV/EBITDA value of 12.77. In contrast, Hilton is a cheaper stock with an EV/EBITDA value of 11.19.Gross MarginCompanies which are part of the hospitality industry generate billions of dollars of revenues. Additionally, several companies are well established which implies that appreciably high profit margins are generated by companies with differing market capitalizations.With a gross margin TTM value of 16.1%, Marriott underperforms its smaller rival Hilton on this count. On the other hand, Hilton sports a gross margin TTM value of 72.6%, which outperforms Marriott as well as the broader industry, which has a gross margin TTM value of 36.8%.Earnings History, ESP and Estimate RevisionsWhen considering Earnings ESP, Hilton is a clear winner with an ESP value of +0.13%, which is superior to Marriott’s reading of -1.11%. The situation is similar when comparing the increase in earnings estimates over the last thirty days. While Marriott’s estimate has increased by 2.1%, Hilton is better off on this count since its estimate has increased by 3.9% over the same period.Considering a more comprehensive earnings history, both Hilton and Marriott have delivered positive surprises in each of the trailing four quarters. However, Hilton has a superior average earnings surprise of 19.2% compared to Marriott’s figure of 9.1%.ConclusionBoth Hilton and Marriott carry a Zacks Rank #2, so there is little to choose between the two on this count. However, our comparative analysis shows that Marriott has an edge over Hilton when considering price performance, debt ratios and dividend yields.But when considering valuations, gross margins and current ratios, Hilton is a superior stock. Hilton is also ahead when considering their comprehensive earnings histories and estimate revisions.What clinches the case firmly in favor of Hilton is a superior ESP value of +0.13% than Marriott’s reading of -1.11%. This is why it may be a good idea to bet on Hilton over Marriott as they prepare to report earnings on Feb 14.  The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of All                 Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

464,HLT,"The U.S hotel industry posted a stellar performance in 2017 and experts believe that it will break more records through next year. Demand for hotel rooms is burgeoning, with revenue per available room (RevPAR) increasing for a whopping 94 months in a row.A strong economy bolstered by record consumer spending levels was cited as the primary reason for the impressive performance. Such encouraging factors will help the hotel industry gain traction in the near future, while GOP tax cuts will spur an increase in leisure as well as hotel development. Given the positives, doubling down on the hottest hotel stocks seems judicious.Record-Breaking Growth Projected for Hotel IndustryAs per hotel research firm STR and Tourism Economics, the hotel industry is projected to see a 0.3% rise in occupancy in 2018. Average daily rate (ADR) and RevPAR are expected to rise 2.4% to $129.77 and 2.7% to $85.82. While the luxury and independent segments will witness the largest increase in occupancy this year, Independent hotels are expected to post considerable growth in ADR (+2.5%) and RevPAR (+2.9%).As per the report’s initial forecast for 2019, the hotel industry is projected to report a 0.1% increase in occupancy, 2.3% growth in ADR to $132.81 and 2.4% rise in RevPAR to $87.89.  RevPAR is expected to be the maximum at the Luxury segment.All the three key metrics are poised to scale north this year and the next as demand continues to outpace supply.Outlook2018 Forecast2019 ForecastDemand+2.3%+2.0%Supply+2.0%+1.9%(Source: STR/Tourism Economics)Needless to say, occupancy increased 0.9% last year and ADR rose 2.1% to almost $127, driving RevPAR by 3%. All the metrics surpassed projections and touched record levels, per the report. Houston, Texas, in the meantime, reported the highest spike in RevPAR, thanks to displaced residents seeking rooms due to hurricane Harvey. Meanwhile, Nashville, Tennessee, posted the largest rise in ADR.Stronger GDP — A Key CatalystThe hotel industry is in a solid position moving through the next year, particularly due to a stronger economy powered by record consumer spending levels. The nation’s GDP increased at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 2.6% in the final three months of 2017 following gains in the previous two quarters of more than 3%, per the “advance” estimate released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis. This marked the economy’s strongest stretch of growth since the expansion started in mid-2009.The economy was driven by solid consumer spending in the fourth quarter. The main engine of the economy grew at 3.8% over the quarter after a 2.2% gain in the third quarter. Consumer outlays, thus, registered the fastest pace of growth in the fourth quarter in almost two years. Spending, in fact, climbed 0.4% in December, notching the highest increase in household buying since 2011.Consumers are, largely, benefitting from a low unemployment level and rise in income. Jobless rate remained at an ultra-low level of 4.1% and workers’ pay increased 2.5% from December 2016 to December 2017 (read more: 5 Winning Stocks for Best Stretch of Growth Since '09).Tax Overhaul Policy to Benefit Hotel IndustryThe GOP tax cuts are a blessing in disguise for the hotel industry. President Trump’s new tax plan will reduce individual tax rates as the headline-grabbing move lowers corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. The tax cut will be implemented this year, instead of being delayed until 2019 (read more: GOP Passes Landmark Tax Bill: Best & Worst for Stocks).On an individual level, tax cuts will boost the paychecks for many workers and will result in higher discretionary income for leisure travel. This in turn will boost revenues for hoteliers. Major hotels, in the meantime, will advantage from the corporate tax cut and spend the extra money on business development and growth in America.4 Top PicksIt will, therefore, be prudent to invest in fundamentally sound hotel stocks that can make the most of the bullish run.

By the end of the last reported quarter, the company's portfolio included 739 properties in 57 countries. Hyatt continues to expand in high-growth markets as well as underpenetrated ones with excess capacity.Toward this end, Hyatt recently announced the opening of Grand Hyatt Manila in Philippines.

Notably, courtesy of aggressive expansion efforts, the company’s hotel opening agreements have continually outpaced actual openings and this trend is expected to continue in the near future as well. The company has experienced net room growth of between 6% and 7% for ten consecutive quarters.Further, we expect the recent launch to boost Hyatt’s Owned and Leased Hotels revenues.

Comparable Owned and Leased hotels RevPAR declined 0.5% (down 1.1% at cc).Countering Competition International expansion should help the company gain market share.

The brand is also reimaging its food & beverage offerings.These initiatives will mark the start of a complete transformation of the brand’s food & beverage program.Shares of Hilton have rallied 37.1% in the past six months, outperforming the industry’s gain of 32.7%.Sales-Building Plans on TrackThe recent move qualifies as one of the many sales-building initiatives that have been undertaken by Hilton. Through the addition of the lunch and dinner offerings, Hilton is trying to reach out to more guests and inspire them to stay beyond the complimentary hours for lunches and dinners.Moreover, by providing full-service dining experience and fast-casual dining in a bar-like set up, the company is trying to appeal to the contemporary tastes of a wide range of customers.In fact, the company’s latest introductions are in line with the current trend of jazzing up the food and bar offerings at many restaurants.Hilton Honors: A Traffic DriverThese initiatives are part of Hilton’s strategy to enhance customer loyalty, primarily because Embassy Suites is under Hilton Honors — one of the largest loyalty programs in the hospitality space.

468,HLT,"Hasbro, Inc. (HAS  -  Free Report) stock has been losing sheen of late. Further, the company carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Let’s take a look at some of the factors that are weighing on the stock.Dismal Price PerformanceA look at Hasbro’s price trend reveals that the stock has witnessed an unimpressive run on the bourses in the past six months. Shares of the company have lost 13.4% against the industry’s gain of 8% in the same time frame. This reflects investors’ pessimism on the stock, given an uncertain sales environment and rising expenses. Toys ‘R’ Us Bankruptcy Forces Hasbro to Guide LowThe recent Toys ‘R’ Us bankruptcy came as a blow to Hasbro’s top line. The company saw a decline in third-quarter 2017 revenues. Taking into account the adverse impacts that are expected to continue, the company has revised its fourth-quarter revenue growth guidance in the range of 4% to 7%, lower than its earlier projections.Reduced Spending to Further Hurt Industry PlayersConsumer spending uncertainty continues in the United States as customers are restraining their non-essential purchases. Despite moderate improvement in economic growth, consumers are increasing their spending only modestly as an increase in jobs this year is yet to translate into significantly higher wages.Higher health care costs and still-tightened credit availability continue to hurt consumer discretionary spending. As a result, Americans are unwilling to spend much on dispensable items, thereby pulling down the company’s sales.Meanwhile, mostly weak performance in Latin American markets like Brazil due to a challenging macroeconomic environment along with ongoing softness in the United Kingdom remains a concern. This may continue to hurt revenues in the near term.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector are Melco Resorts & Entertainment (MLCO  -  Free Report), Boyd Gaming Corp.

473,HLT,"Founded in 2008 by Brian Chesky, Joe Gebbia, and Nathan Blecharczyk, Airbnb is an app and website that connects people seeking lodging with renters who have listed their personal houses, apartments, guest rooms, etc., on either platform. Travelers can book accommodations around the world online or from a tablet or mobile phone.Airbnb is an easy way for people to monetize any extra living space they have. With over 3 million listings worldwide—including 1,400 castles—it operates in over 65,000 cities and 191 countries, the company has a total guest list of more than 150 million people.Airbnb as a LifestyleBack in 2014, Airbnb announced a huge, company-wide rebranding, indicating a desire to transition from a hotel service to a lifestyle brand. Since its inception, it has been easy to categorize the company as just another hotel option, taking on big industry names like Wyndham , Hyatt (H  -  Free Report), Hilton Worldwide (HLT  -  Free Report), and InterContinental Hotels (IHG  -  Free Report).But its brand upheaval demonstrates how Airbnb has the potential to be something much more. In a blog post, the company stated they want to possess a logo that will be seen on a variety of products, houses, and businesses, to make sure people understand that whoever owns it is a supporter of their ideal—but, more importantly, a supporter of their brand.Dubbed Bélo, its logo is a symbol of belonging. While it may look like a misshapen paperclip, Bélo is a “symbol for people who want to welcome into their home new experiences, new cultures, and new conversations.” Airbnb has also redesigned its website and app, which are now far cleaner than previous versions, and feature subtle animations and flashier imagery.Controversies to ConsiderAirbnb may present a legitimate challenge to the hotel industry, but the company is enveloped by controversy and regulatory issues in cities that are none too pleased with residents turning their homes into hotels, reflecting similar problems that plague companies like Uber.In San Francisco, critics have blamed Airbnb for the growing vacancy rates and the over $3,900 average monthly rent. Average home prices in the city recently hit the $1.1 million median mark, and San Francisco’s population has reached an all-time high, according to Paragon Real Estate Group.Despite the absence of a permit, which, according to law, one must have in order to rent for under 30 days, San Francisco residents are still illegally listing personal homes and apartments for less than the required number of days on Airbnb. And, legislation was approved in San Francisco last June that would require anyone listing available property on Airbnb or other sites to register the property with the city, most likely hindering a person’s ability to casually list a spare room for some extra cash going forwardThe company is also embroiled in a long-standing battle with New York City, where they face similar issues as in San Francisco. Last fall, the New York State Senate passed a bill that makes online apartment listings for stays shorter than 30 days illegal, which, not surprisingly, thwarts Airbnb in their goal to expand its market.Shortly after, Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed that bill into law, with politicians, local hoteliers, and affordable housing advocates hailing the decision as a victory. Some have calculated that the law has deleted roughly half of Airbnb listings in New York. “To avoid fees, hosts in large apartment buildings can only rent rooms or beds in their houses, not their entire apartment,” notes Travel + Leisure, while hosts who rent entire homes or row houses will not be affected.But Airbnb’s biggest challenge may have been dealing with the #AirbnbWhileBlack controversy, which was a recent protest movement against multiple instances of the company’s hosts apparently declining guests due to skin color. Airbnb admitted that a problem exists, and at the time, said it was trying to tackle the problem by educating hosts and guests, and by responding to concerns they raise.Commenting at the 2016 Fortune Brainstorm Tech conference, CEO Chesky said that “We were so focused on creating trust and safety that we took our eye off the ball on this other important issue,” Chesky said. “There were lots of things we didn’t think about when we, as three white guys, designed the platform.”IPO BuzzSince 2014, and regardless of its fight with certain cities, rumors have been swirling of Airbnb’s inevitable initial public offering, even though CEO Chesky said no to an IPO at that time. In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, Chesky said that “we will do it at a time when it benefits the company, when we have a good reason.”Airbnb’s last valuation clocked in at $31 billion—it’s worth only about $15 billion less than Marriot (MAR  -  Free Report)—thanks to its latest billion-dollar round of equity funding, making it the second most valuable U.S. startup behind Uber. This, as well as being a recognized name in the hotel industry and sharing economy, is helping raise buzz. Their popularity among venture capitalists (VCs) is helping increase hype, too.However, this new round of funding, in addition to a separate deal where investors are planning to buy $200 million in stock from Airbnb employees, could be seen as a move to relieve some of the pressure of filing for an IPO. Airbnb is adding significantly to its amount of available cash, allowing it to spend enough and continue its global expansion without going public.Airbnb is also reportedly watching fellow tech unicorn Spotify, and what IPO route the music streaming giant will take. According to The Wall Street Journal, Airbnb may want to mimic Spotify’s unconventional plans; Spotify is planning to list its shares directly on the New York Stock Exchange without raising a new round of funding (also read: Spotify is Likely Going Public Without an IPO: Will Other Tech Unicorns Follow?)This move benefits private companies who don’t need cash, “but want a way for employees, founders, and other shareholders to start trading their shares,” notes Business Insider.How Might an Airbnb IPO Perform?Thanks to Snap Inc.’s (SNAP  -  Free Report) very successful IPO last March, the spotlight is shining with renewed intensity on startups like Airbnb, and investors are wondering if the online hospitality marketplace will file for an IPO this year.Like other tech companies, Airbnb is a company for the digital age, and many are wanting to be the first ones to invest in its expected success. Billions of dollars have been invested in the digital sharing economy over the past few years—specifically, in companies whose platforms are apps and websites that connect a person selling an item or service with a consumer who wants to use that item or service.Particularly, Airbnb is popular because it is inexpensive to run; it doesn’t have to build or maintain hotels or hotel staff. The company is also easy to grow quickly, as there is no need for a physical office in every country, just consumers with a smartphone.Like any tech startup, Airbnb’s IPO will be a toss-up. Its valuation is impressive in and of itself, and will most likely be the driving factor for investors come time for a public entrance into the market. Airbnb needs to keep an eye on their increasing competition. Companies like Roomorama, Homeaway, and the Expedia (EXPE)-owned Housetrip all have a dedicated following of their own, and are all beginning to eat into the market share.Despite rival companies and regulatory issues, Airbnb has the potential to be one of the hottest upcoming IPOs. With billions of dollars in investments already, a thriving rebranding, and its rising popularity among travelers, Airbnb’s IPO is one to watch out for.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time. It’s a once-in-a-generation opportunity to invest in pure genius. Click for details >>

474,HLT,"Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (HLT  -  Free Report) is known for its scale, size and commercial platform. The company has a portfolio of more than 100 hotels and resorts in Latin America and is actively pursuing growth opportunities in the area.Also, the company has fortified its global hold apart from expanding in the domestic market.In line with this expansion strategy, Curio Collection by Hilton recently launched Mahogany Bay Resort & Beach Club in Belize, an independent country bordered by Mexico in the north. Marking the company’s first property in the country and one of the first branded resorts in Belize, Mahogany Bay features 205 cottage and villa-style rooms and offers various amenities. The hotel lies in close proximity to the San Pedro Airport and San Pedro, the only town on the island.Notably, Curio Collection by Hilton was launched in 2014 and has been performing really well ever since. The brand currently has a global portfolio of more than 40 remarkable, upper upscale hotels and resorts. The latest hotel launch not only adds to the company’s brand portfolio but will also help it gain traction in untapped markets.The new hotel is also part of Hilton Honors, which is one of the largest loyalty programs. With about 70 million members, this network has created an extremely valuable asset for the company. In fact, about 57% of all occupancy per night takes place through this membership program. The company is focused on making multiple enhancements to its loyalty program in order to make it the most customer-centric program, driving incremental value for guests and the overall system.In addition to enhancing customer loyalty, Hilton maintains strong fundamentals and cash flow position, which are beneficial for the company’s shareholders. In order to return more to shareholders, Hilton has transformed into a capital-light operating business backed by the spin-off of a portfolio of hotels and resorts as well as its timeshare business.On Jan 4, Hilton completed the spin-off of Park Hotels & Resorts, Inc. (PK  -  Free Report) and Hilton Grand Vacations Inc. (HGV  -  Free Report), resulting in three independent, publicly-traded companies. On the same day, the company put the previously announced 1-for-3 reverse stock split into effect. All these developments are expected to make Hilton a fee-based, capital efficient and resilient business, with substantial global expansion potential.Post the split, the company’s shares have rallied nearly 32.3% to date and the S&P 500 market has gained 16.3%.However, macroeconomic fluctuations, unfavorable currency translation and competition from larger hoteliers like Marriott International, Inc. (MAR  -  Free Report) might dent Hilton’s top line.Nonetheless, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company can continue gaining traction on aggressive expansion plans.

475,HLT,"Marriott International, Inc. (MAR  -  Free Report) recently announced the opening of Roomers Munich in Germany’s burgeoning Westend. Created by Gekko Group, this marks the company’s fourth hotel in the city. Notably, the upscale hotel is a part of Marriott’s Autograph Collection Hotels — a distinctive collection of passionately independent hotels.   Along with 281 guest rooms and suites, the hotel also features unique food and beverage outlet, a spa, seven individual conference rooms, 850 square meter event area and two outdoor terraces. Autograph Collection boasts more than 110 luxury lifestyle hotels in nearly 30 countries and territories in some of the most remarkable destinations around the world.In fact, the new hotel opening is in line with Marriott’s consistent efforts to expand its presence in the United States as well as international markets, given a steady rise in business and leisure travel.After announcing the acquisition of Starwood Hotels & Resorts on Sep 23, 2016, Marriott became the world’s largest hotel company. Currently, it has more than 6,400 properties across 126 countries and territories, under 30 brand names. Post-acquisition, shares of the company have soared 86.6% while the S&P 500 gained 21.7%. Additionally, the company believes that the linking of three industry-leading guest loyalty programs — Marriott Rewards, Ritz-Carlton Rewards and Starwood Preferred Guest — would lead to an even larger loyalty community. Further, investments in technology for hotel bookings are likely to improve guest experience and thus improve occupancy.However, lingering political uncertainties in key international markets along with currency headwinds remain concerns for Marriott and most of the other hotel chains including Hyatt Hotels Corporation (H  -  Free Report), Hilton Worldwide Holdings (HLT  -  Free Report) and Wyndham Worldwide Corporation .Notwithstanding the headwinds, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company’s continual expansion efforts and an unmatched portfolio of lodging brands, raises optimism in the stock.

476,HLT,"Duluth Holdings Inc. (DLTH  -  Free Report) is slated to report third-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Dec 7, before the market opens.This apparel retailer has a mixed record of bottom-line surprises in the trailing four quarters, with a beat of 30% in the preceding quarter. Considering this, let’s delve into how things are shaping for the upcoming announcement.Which Way are Estimates Treading?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter has declined by a penny over the past 30 days and is currently pegged at break even. We note that the company delivered earnings of one cent in the prior-year quarter.On other hand, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $84.3 million in the said quarter, which depicts an improvement of 25.7% from the year-ago quarter.Duluth Holdings Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Duluth Holdings Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Duluth Holdings Inc. QuoteFactors Impacting the Quarter Duluth Holdings has been steadily expanding store base, driven by strong growth in direct and retail segments. The upside can be attributed to robust men’s and women’s business lines. During the second quarter of fiscal 2017, the company opened three retail stores and remains on track with the opening of 15 new stores during fiscal 2017. We expect Duluth Holdings third-quarter performance to benefit from store expansion initiatives. Additionally, the company’s widening consumer base is also attributable to dedicated omni-channel expansion efforts and marketing strategies. Owing to such endeavors, Duluth Holdings has been delivering year-over-year growth in top line for quite some time now.However, retail store expansions have substantially raised the company’s selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses. SG&A expenses rose 39.4% and 26.1% year on year during the first and second quarters of 2017, respectively. Enhanced customer services and store occupancy costs have led to a rise in the company’s expenditure levels. Such headwinds are expected to linger in the third quarter as well. Nevertheless, we expect the aforementioned growth drivers to cushion the company from these obstacles and aid growth.What Does the Zacks Model Unveil? Our proven model does not conclusively show that Duluth Holdings is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.Duluth Holdings carries a Zacks Rank #3 but has an Earnings ESP of -100.00% consequently making surprise prediction difficultYou may uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Stocks With Favorable CombinationsHere are some companies which, according to our model, have the right combination of elements to deliver earnings beat.Ralph Lauren Corporation (RL  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.05% and a Zacks Rank #1.

The stock surged a whopping 30.1%, reflecting strong investor optimism through the year.Further, the company delivered a ROE of 31.1% in the trailing 12 months compared with the industry’s 7.6%. This shows that it has a more efficient profit generation and reinvestment capacity compared to peers.Given its strong brand recognition and improving non-gaming revenues, coupled with expansion in the domestic market, we believe that the stock has decent upside potential.Let’s see what the New Year holds in store for Las Vegas Sands.A Strong Portfolio and Solid Business Model Bode WellWe believe that Las Vegas Sands will continue to benefit from a solid business model, extensive high-quality assets and attractive property locations through 2018.

480,HLT,"Shares of Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (HLT  -  Free Report) hit a 52-week high of $84.71 on Jan 12, eventually closing a tad lower at $83.95.The company’s shares have charted a growth trajectory in recent times, appreciating 34% in the past six months, ahead of the industry’s gain of 30.3%.Let’s delve deeper into the company’s strong fundamentals that may have led to the rally in share price. Hilton Honors Upgrade to Drive TrafficHilton has created one of the largest loyalty programs, Hilton Honors. With about 70 million members, this network has created an extremely valuable asset for the company. In fact, about 57% of all occupancy per night takes place through this member program. The company believes that enhancing its loyalty program can reach out to more guests, thereby driving traffic.Recently, the company announced a few updates to its guest loyalty program. Hilton announced that all its members will continue to earn points the way they always have and can also opt for new elite tier bonus rates. This will be applicable for the company’s Silver, Gold and Diamond members.The perks of the updated loyalty program will include 10,000 Bonus Points on every tenth night, once members reach at least 40 nights in a calendar year. Hilton is also providing the option to rollover nights and gift status.The company is continuing to make multiple enhancements to its loyalty program in order to make it more customer-centric by driving incremental value for guests and the overall system.Additionally, innovations such as the Hilton Honors app continue to drive growth in the program. In addition to being the company’s fastest growing and lowest cost distribution channel, this app enables a differentiated customer experience.Meanwhile, Hilton announced a partnership with American Express (Amex) in a bid to boost the program’s ability to drive demand. In November 2017, Amex launched a marketing portfolio of Hilton Honors credit cards in the country, which will drive the program’s membership and enhance member engagement. The growth of card spend under this partnership should benefit license fee growth for Hilton.We believe that the appraisal with Hilton Honors will significantly strengthen Hilton’s customer base and boost the company’s top line via increased traffic.Brand Expansion Efforts Boost Investor ConfidenceHilton’s price rise seems to be the result of strong investor optimism, given that Hilton’s scale, size, commercial platform and industry-leading brands continue to drive growth. Hilton maintains its position as the fastest growing global hospitality company on an organic basis with presence in 104 countries and territories.The company continues to make great progress in its luxury development strategy, anticipating double-digit luxury growth over the next several years. Hilton’s new brands, including Home2 Suites, Tru by Hilton, Tapestry Collection, are also gaining momentum globally.Shareholder-Friendly Capital-Light Business Model Hilton has transformed into a capital-light operating business backed by the spin-off of a portfolio of hotels and resorts. Post spin-off, the company expects to be a resilient, fee-driven business with disciplined strategy. In fact, the focus is expected to be on growing market share, units, free cash flow per share as well as accelerating return of capital (ROE). Furthermore, as Hilton’s unit growth is mostly financed by third parties, the company is capable of generating substantial returns on minimal capital investment.Subsequently, the company delivered a return on equity (ROE) of 27.3% in the trailing 12 months as against the industry’s loss of 19%. This supports its growth potential and indicates that the company reinvests more efficiently compared to peers.Analysts Optimistic For 2018, three estimates have gone up while none moved down in the last 60 days. The trend has been favorable too, with estimates rising from $2.26 a share 60 days ago to $2.43 currently, marking an increase of 7.5%. This shows that analysts are positive on the stock’s potential, which is backed by the company’s vigorous expansion and sales-building initiatives.Zacks Rank & Other Stocks to ConsiderHilton carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).A few other top-ranked stocks in the hotel space include InterContinental Hotels Group PLC (IHG  -  Free Report), Hyatt Hotels Corporation (H  -  Free Report) and Choice Hotels International, Inc.

481,HLT,"Hyatt Hotels Corporation (H  -  Free Report), which is currently one of the best-performing stocks in the hotel space, has strong fundamentals. Robust share price appreciation along with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) makes the stock a lucrative pick for your portfolio now.Shares of Hyatt have outperformed its industry in the past three months. The stock has rallied 28.3% as compared with the industry’s gain of 16.6%.Moreover, upward revision in earnings estimates for 2018 reflects analysts’ unwavering confidence in the company. Over the past two months, the year’s earnings estimates inched up 6.5%. The company also delivered positive earnings surprises in each of the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 81.63%.Per our VGM Score, which identifies the most attractive value, growth and momentum characteristics, Hyatt has a Momentum Score of B. This reflects the appropriate time to invest in the stock.Strong Brand & Expansion Plans Drive Market ShareBeing a widely recognized hotelier, Hyatt continues to gain global market share in managed and franchised hotels by providing innovative, exceptional and personalized services to guests. The company, with 38,000 associates, has a collective inventory of nearly 130,000 places to stay across 56 countries. Hyatt is also consistently trying to expand its presence worldwide and has expansion plans in Asia-Pacific, Europe, Africa, Middle East and Latin America.In fact, the company recently opened the first Hyatt Place hotel in Hyderabad, India. This has helped it expand its fast-growing select service category (that offers services at affordable prices) in a country which has a growing middle-class population and a significant number of local business travelers.Meanwhile, across the globe and its brands, the company’s latest deals have continually driven its openings. In fact, the company has seen net room growth between 6% and 7% in the last ten quarters.Cash Position Strong on Franchise Business & Assets SaleAs part of its efforts to expand select-service presence, Hyatt continues to construct franchised properties. It is also converting and renovating non-Hyatt properties, and in certain cases, developing new managed properties. This will provide the company with a more stable growth profile. A higher concentration of franchise fees also reduces earnings volatility.Additionally, in order to gain financial flexibility and focus more on core operations, the company is carrying out asset sales. Recently, Hyatt sold its 550-rommed Hyatt Regency Monterey Hotel and Spa for approximately $60 million. This resulted in a pre-tax gain of approximately $17 million. This property was one of the six asset sales planned by the company. Notably, the property will be under a long-term franchise agreement within the Hyatt system.The sale of assets is helping the company grow through management and licensing arrangements, instead of direct ownership of selective assets. However, Hyatt continues to manage the properties post sale. This allows the company to protect its current liabilities with a combination of cash and liquid assets.Enhancing Shareholders’ Value Recently, Hyatt’s board approved the repurchase of up to an additional $750 million shares. Including the latest authorization, the company has approximately $864 million shares left to be repurchased under its existing authorization. It bought back shares worth $700 million between Jan 1 and Nov 15, 2017.Notably, the company delivered a return on equity (ROE) of 6.13% in the trailing 12 months as against the industry’s loss of 19%. This supports its growth potential and indicates that the company reinvests more efficiently compared to peers.However, Hyatt is not rewarding shareholders at the expense of business expansion. It has a solid cash position to explore profitable avenues. The company continues to focus on investing in brand and sales building.Acquisitions Drive Traffic & RevenuesLast year, Hyatt acquired Miraval Group, the renowned provider of wellness and mindfulness experiences and included Miraval Life in Balance Spa brand. As part of the transaction, it added three destination wellness resort properties in Tucson, Austin and Lenox to its portfolio and is making good progress with the redevelopment and expansion of the resorts. Though the Miraval operations are likely to contribute meaningfully to Hyatt's overall earnings 2019 onward, the company stated that the initial results have been positive.Moreover, the company is increasing its focus on private accommodations, another fast-growing travel segment, which has the potential to extend the Hyatt brand beyond traditional hotel space and is a fantastic fit to the Hyatt portfolio and its brand positioning.Thus, Hyatt made a strategic investment in Oasis Collections, a curated marketplace that blends the value and authenticity of private homes with quality service and exceptional amenities. The company believes that this category has the potential to serve new-stay occasions for its customers and add meaningfully to top-line growth.Notably, in third-quarter 2017, Hyatt acquired Exhale for $16 million and the company expects to gain significantly from the same. The company intends to continue exploring new undertakings apart from traditional hotel growth in order to evolve with changing taste and preference of guests. The increasing traffic trend will eventually help the company drive revenues. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 sales projects growth of 1.7%.Stocks to ConsiderA few other top-ranked stocks in the hotel space include InterContinental Hotels Group PLC (IHG  -  Free Report), Choice Hotels International, Inc. (CHH  -  Free Report) and Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (HLT  -  Free Report). While InterContinental Hotels sports a Zacks Rank #1, Choice Hotels and Hilton carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Meanwhile, for 2017, Marriott anticipates earnings in the band of $4.22 to $4.24 per share, up from the earlier guided range of $4.06 to $4.18.We note that after the acquisition of Starwood Hotels & Resorts on Sep 23, 2016, Marriott has become the world’s largest hotel company. Currently, it has more than 6,400 properties across 126 countries and territories, under 30 brand names.Post-acquisition of Starwood, shares of the company have surged 75.9% while the broader S&P 500 index gained 19%. After sorting out its integration challenges, Marriott’s shares are well poised to continue growing, as and when positive synergies are realized.   Additionally, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company continues to reflect strength in several areas. Therefore, it is expected to continue performing well in the quarters ahead. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Key Growth DriversAttractive Brand Position, Acquisitions to Drive Growth: Marriott’s extensive portfolio and a strong brand position allow it to charge a premium room rate in the highly competitive lodging industry. Given its property locations, we believe that the company is well-poised to benefit from the increasing market demand backed by stepped-up business as well as leisure traveling in major North American and international locations.Meanwhile, with the completion of the Starwood acquisition, Marriott's distribution has more than doubled in Asia and the Middle East & Africa combined. In fact, the buyout is likely to result in a bigger brand with increased scale and a robust development pipeline in the long run.Interestingly, even with 30 brands under portfolio, the company has not ruled out further M&A activities. It holds about 14-15% market share in the United States and therefore has further room to grow.Robust Expansion Plans: In addition to domestic markets, Marriott is consistently trying to expand its presence worldwide and capitalize on the demand for hotels in international markets. Going forward, the company plans to significantly grow its global portfolio of luxury and lifestyle brands. Also, it anticipates gross room additions of 7% in 2018 that is likely to continue building economics, scale and consumer preference for its brands.Outside the United States, the hotel giant is trying to expand its footprint, especially in Asia, Latin America, Middle East and Africa. In fact, Marriott’s European pipeline has grown consistently in the recent past and is expected to continue, going forward.Within Asia-Pacific, China promises immense growth potential despite the economic slowdown. In fact, in August 2017, the company entered into a joint venture agreement with Alibaba to develop a travel storefront that leverage the latter’s digital travel platform, retail expertise and digital payment platform, Alipay.Notably, China is the largest source market for outbound travel now. In fact, Chinese outbound travel is set to boom further with 700 million trips projected over the next five years. As a result, Marriott expects this new joint venture to aid in capturing a greater share of this growing Chinese travel market, increase membership of its loyalty programs and reduce distribution costs. Apart from China, the company continues to focus on other Asian countries like India, Indonesia, Thailand and Australia for further expansion.We expect the company’s continuous expansion plans to add immensely to the top line and boost its overall performance as well.Embracing Social Media and Smartphones to Build Loyalty:  Digital innovations and social media have already started playing an important role in hotel bookings. Marriott too has rolled out guestVoice to measure guest feedback, introduced SPG Mobile check-in and check-out in North America, and achieved procurement and OTA cost savings.Additionally, post its acquisition of Starwood, Marriott has linked industry-leading guest loyalty programs — Marriott Rewards, Ritz-Carlton Rewards and Starwood Preferred Guest — and announced the matching of member status between the programs, thereby leading to an even larger loyalty community. In fact, the company aims to merge its loyalty programs into one by 2018.These investments in technology for hotel bookings are likely to improve guest experience and thus boost occupancy.Bottom LineDoes this mean that the company has been lying on a bed of roses? Well, not really!Lingering political uncertainties in key international markets along with currency headwinds remain concerns for Marriott and most of the other hotel chains including Hyatt Hotels Corporation (H  -  Free Report), Hilton Worldwide Holdings (HLT  -  Free Report) and Wyndham Worldwide Corporation .Still, we believe that the company’s unmatched portfolio of lodging brands, strong global footprint along with an increased demand for travel will pave the way for its growth, going forward.Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Royal Caribbean’s current year’s earnings has moved up 2.4%, reflecting nine upward revisions versus none downwards. Also, next year’s earnings estimates have inched up 2.1% on the back of nine upward revisions versus no downward revision.All these positive earnings estimate revisions testifies the unwavering confidence that analysts have in the company and further adds to the optimism in the stock.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

483,HLT,"Online travel booking companies Priceline , Expedia (EXPE  -  Free Report) and TripAdvisor (TRIP  -  Free Report) reported mixed results, but investors punished the shares regardless.In Priceline’s case, the company’s reported revenue and earnings of $4.43 billion and $35.22 a share, represent double digit growth from the year ago quarter and are ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate. While Priceline usually guides conservatively to come back and beat the lowered expectations, this time investors weren’t willing to give it the benefit of the doubt.  Expedia on the other hand, reported revenue and earnings that missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate but revenues still managed to grow from last year. What’s worse, it lowered its EBITDA outlook for the year from 10-15% to a mid- to high-single-digit percentage rate.TripAdvisor missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate on the top line while beating on the bottom line. Earnings were below the year-ago level.When all the major players in any market produce unsatisfactory earnings reports, there’s very likely to be a common factor hitting them. In this case, it’s the hotels themselves.Hotels generally share their inventory with online travel companies to facilitate the distribution of room nights for a fee. But as they grew larger and started enjoying the benefits of scale, these OTAs charged higher and higher fees, such that smaller hotels couldn’t afford it, while larger hotels had to part with a good amount of their profits.Or at least that is what hotels are saying through the American Hotel & Lodging Association. The association is looking to lobby people in the new administration and those serving in the ITC, objecting to what they call the companies’ monopolistic business.Another gripe with hotels is the online travel agents’ refusal to pay occupancy tax, thus forcing hotels to pay.Google is also eating their lunch. The leading search engine is gaining on all fronts, first through advertising fees that companies like Expedia and Priceline pay and second, through services like Book on Google that lead customers directly to the hotel’s app or web portal.The hotel, then, offers loyalty points and other incentives to encourage customers to come directly to them instead of through an online travel agent. A recent report from Skift estimates that Google’s travel business is now worth a $100 billion, or more than Priceline.OTAs can’t afford to sit and wait until all the business is lost. So they are investing heavily in marketing. This, again, is hurting their profits.If this is a depressing picture, it luckily isn’t the only alternative for investors looking for travel exposure. And indeed, since hotels are pitted against OTAs in this battle, why not invest in hotels themselves? So here is a list of hotels that are worth investing in right now.Marriott International (MAR  -  Free Report)Marriott International is the world's largest hotel company. Marriott operates and franchises hotels and licenses vacation ownership resorts. The company's many leading brands include: Bulgari, The Ritz-Carlton® and The Ritz-Carlton Reserve, St. Regis, W, EDITION, JW Marriott, The Luxury Collection, Marriott Hotels, Westin, Le Méridien, Renaissance Hotels, Sheraton, Delta Hotels by MarriottSM, Marriott Executive Apartments, Marriott Vacation Club, Autograph Collection Hotels, Tribute Portfolio, Design Hotels, Gaylord Hotels, Courtyard, Four Points by Sheraton, SpringHill Suites, Fairfield Inn & Suites, Residence Inn, TownePlace Suites, AC Hotels by Marriott, Aloft, Element, Moxy Hotels and Protea Hotels by Marriott.

Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers.

484,HLT,"Hyatt Hotels Corporation’s (H  -  Free Report) strong developmental pipeline, consistent expansion plans, extensive international exposure and attempt toward expanding beyond traditional hotel are major growth drivers.However, lingering political uncertainties in international markets pose a threat to profits.Recently, this leading global hospitality company announced third-quarter 2017 results. Adjusted earnings per share of 26 cents beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 17 cents by 52.9%. However, earnings were down 44.7% year over year from 47 cents due to natural disasters and the Jewish Holiday timing.Net revenues of $1.12 billion rose 2.8% year over year on the back of higher management and franchise fees, increased other revenues as well as a rise in other revenues from managed properties, partially offset by lower contribution from owned and leased hotels. The top line also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.09 billion by more than 2%.Key Growth DriversHyatt’s strong differentiated brand portfolio and exceptional personalized service have helped the company gain traction globally through both its managed and franchised hotels.As of Sep 30, 2017, the company's portfolio included 739 properties in 57 countries under 13 premier brands.In addition to domestic lands, Hyatt is consistently trying to expand its presence in the Asia-Pacific, Europe, Africa, Middle East and Latin America regions. Interestingly, the company has experienced net rooms' growth between 6% and 7% for ten consecutive quarters. With plans of opening at least 60 hotels, 2017 is set be another year of record openings.Also, the company continues to rapidly expand the Hyatt Place and Hyatt House brands globally, reflecting its robust momentum in the fast-growing select service category.Meanwhile, the acquisition of Miraval in January has helped Hyatt expand beyond traditional hotel stays into the swiftly growing space of wellness, which goes well with high-end travelers. Though Miraval’s operations are likely to contribute meaningfully to Hyatt's overall earnings starting 2019, the initial response has been positive as well.In fact, post the Miraval acquisition, the company’s shares have rallied 28.9% to date compared with the industry’s growth of 19.6%.Moreover, Hyatt is continuously devising new plans to enhance guest experience and drive occupancy in order to survive in a tough economic environment.  In first-quarter 2017, Hyatt launched a loyalty program World of Hyatt — a platform for guest engagement. The company is witnessing higher level of guest satisfaction owing to the enhancement of its loyalty program which is helping the company gain market share and add customers.ConcernsMacroeconomic concerns in several international markets might spell trouble for the company. In the Middle East, political unrest, lower government spending, new hotels and a tough oil market continue to hurt tourism.Moreover, given a substantial exposure in the international markets, the company is vulnerable to fluctuations in exchange rates like other hotel companies including Marriott International, Inc. (MAR  -  Free Report), Hilton Worldwide Holdings (HLT  -  Free Report) and Wyndham Worldwide Corporation . Notably, Hyatt has been witnessing a decline in international inbound travel owing to a stronger dollar.Hyatt currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

486,HLT,"Hyatt Hotels Corporation (H  -  Free Report) recently announced the launch of Hyatt Place Hyderabad/Banjara Hills — the first Hyatt Place hotel in Hyderabad, India. This is the third Hyatt hotel in the city of Hyderabad after Park Hyatt Hyderabad and Hyatt Hyderabad, Gachibowli.Developed by BGR Mining & Infra Ltd, the 147-room hotel is strategically located in the center of the city, with business and sightseeing hubs in the vicinity.We observe that shares of Hyatt have rallied 42.4% in the past six months, outperforming the industry’s 30.8% growth.Target: Middle Class & Local Business TravelersThe launch ispart of Hyatt’s efforts to expand the Hyatt Place brand globally.The brand, which falls under Hyatt’s fast-growing select service category, has immense growth potential in India, China and the Middle East. This is because these regions have a growing middle class population and a significant number of local business travelers whose demand match with Hyatt’s select range of services at affordable prices. Notably, these select services attract more guests than full service hotels in India. The hotel is expected to cater to the need of a wide range of customers in the country.                                                     Hyatt is focused on growing its select-service presence via third-party construction of franchised properties, conversion and renovation of existing non-Hyatt properties, and in certain cases, participation in the development of new managed properties in developing countries.The launch also underscores Hyatt’s consistent efforts to expand worldwide and capitalize on demand for hotels in lucrative international markets. Ongoing expansion should help the company gain market share in the global hospitality industry, thus boosting its business.ConclusionHyatt is known for its strong brand portfolio. By the end of the last reported quarter, the company's portfolio included 739 properties in 57 countries. The company aims to differentiate its brands by providing a distinct experience for different travelers and focusing on gaining global traction on solid brand presence along with innovative personalized services.We expect the recent launch to boost Hyatt’s Owned and Leased Hotels revenues. The performance of the segment was particularly weak in the last reported quarter. Revenues were down 2.7% year over year (down 3.2% at constant currency). Comparable Owned and Leased hotels RevPAR declined 0.5% (down 1.1% at constant currency).Zacks Rank & Other Stocks to ConsiderHyatt sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).A few other top-ranked stocks in the hotel space include InterContinental Hotels Group PLC (IHG  -  Free Report), Choice Hotels International, Inc.

487,HLT,"Wynn Resorts, Limited (WYNN  -  Free Report) had a marvelous run on the bourses in 2017, surging a whopping 94.9% compared with its industry’s gain of 43.1% and the S&P 500’s rally of 19.8%.Given its strong brand recognition and improving non-gaming revenues, coupled with expansion in the domestic market, we believe that the stock has a decent upside potential.Let’s see what the New Year holds in store for Wynn Resorts.  Strong Brand Name to Continue Offering Competitive AdvantageWynn Resorts’ strong brand name allows it to command a premium rate, relative to its peers in the gaming and lodging industry. Moreover, with a gradual revival of the U.S. economy, we expect Wynn to gain market share and grow strategically in 2018.Non-Gaming Sources to Boost RevenuesApart from the gaming business in Macau, the company has been increasingly focusing on boosting non-gaming revenues. Given the decent visitation pattern in Macau, infrastructure development and government’s efforts to boost tourism in Macau, non-gaming sources are expected to boost revenues, going forward.Wynn Resorts, Limited Revenue (TTM) Wynn Resorts, Limited Revenue (TTM) | Wynn Resorts, Limited QuoteMoreover, the company’s full-scale integrated resort in Cotai, Macau, opened in August 2016. The resort is poised to witness increased visits from tourists and leisure gamblers over the long term, which should fortify the company’s position in the Cotai strip. Notably, such projects are expected to draw business and leisure travelers, and provide a solid platform for growth. In fact, building resorts in Asia should help the company to capitalize on the strong consumer spending trend in the region.Tourism & Traffic in Macau to GrowThe government of China is considering measures to support Macau’s economy and introduce favorable policies, which is expected to improve visitation pattern, and boost tourism and traffic. These include the approval of Macau’s maritime expansion plans that are expected to aid shipping and tourism. Also, the government has enabled Mainland China cities to offer multi-entry permits. Moreover, the government has plans of going easy on the smoking ban in casinos which might thereby provide a boost to traffic and revenues.Meanwhile, Wynn Resorts too has been offering various promotional allowances and undertaking initiatives to attract gambling patrons.Expansion in Domestic Market to Reap BenefitsIn order to boost performance in Las Vegas, the company has remodeled rooms at its properties and the baccarat pit. Though tourism in Las Vegas has not yet reached the pre-recession level, it is on its way to recovery. The number of visits has been increasing every year.With an improving job scenario and stabilizing gas prices, the consumer spending environment in the domestic markets is picking up. Backed by the optimism surrounding tourism in Las Vegas and increasing visitation pattern, revenues are likely to grow.Upward Estimate Revisions for 2018Analysts have increased their 2018 estimates for the company, making the earnings picture favorable. Over the past 60 days, three estimates have gone up compared with no downward revision for the year. This trend has caused the Zacks Consensus Estimate to rise, from $6.42 a share 60 days ago to its current level of $6.68 for the year.Zacks Rank and Growth ScoreThe company has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and a Growth Score of A, indicating that it is an impressive choice for growth investors.Other PicksOther top-ranked stocks in the Zacks Consumer Discretionary sectorare Melco Resorts & Entertainment (MLCO  -  Free Report), Boyd Gaming Corporation (BYD  -  Free Report) and Hilton Worldwide Holdings (HLT  -  Free Report), each carrying a Zacks Rank of 2.

Following the earnings release, the company’s shares gained 0.5% in after-hours trading on Nov 7.Also, Marriott became the world's largest hotel company after it completed the acquisition of Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide Inc. on Sep 23, 2016.Earnings and Revenue DiscussionAdjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.10 surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 98 cents by 12.2%. Also, the figure improved 26.4% from combined adjusted EPS of 87 cents in the year-ago quarter. In fact, the bottom line came above management’s guided range of 96 cents to 99 cents.Notably, combined third-quarter 2016 results assume Marriott's acquisition of Starwood and Starwood's sale of its timeshare business that completed on Jan 1, 2015.Adjusted total revenues rose slightly year over year to $5.66 billion and also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5 billion by 13.8%.Excluding the impact of Marriott's acquisition of Starwood and Starwood's sale of its timeshare business on third-quarter 2016 results, the top line in the reported quarter improved a significant 43.7% year over year. This, in turn, reflects the positive impact of Starwood acquisition on third-quarter 2017 revenues.RevPAR & MarginsIn the quarter under review, revenue per available room (RevPAR) for worldwide comparable system-wide properties increased 2.1% in constant dollar (up 2.4% in actual dollars), driven by 1.1% growth in occupancy and a 0.7% rise in average daily rate (ADR). In fact, the reported figure came above management’s guided range of an increase of 1% to 2% on a constant dollar basis.Comparable system-wide RevPAR in North America grew 0.4% in constant dollars (up 0.6% in actual dollars).

Meanwhile, house profit margins for comparable company-operated properties outside North America rose 130 bps.Total adjusted expenses decreased 1.6% year over year to $5 billion mainly due to lower general, administrative and other expenses.General, administrative and other expenses were $201 million, down 15.2% from the year-ago quarter, primarily due to general and administrative cost savings. The figure was also below management’s projected range of $215 million to $220 million.Fourth-Quarter 2017 Outlook RevisedMarriott's outlook for fourth-quarter and full-year 2017 is for the combined company and does not include merger-related costs.For the fourth quarter, earnings per share are now estimated between 98 cents and $1 (earlier 96 cents to $1.05). The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.02 is pegged higher than the guided range.Marriott expects comparable system-wide RevPAR to increase in the range of 2% to 3% on a constant dollar basis in North America and worldwide (earlier 1% to 3% rise). The guidance for fourth-quarter RevPAR growth in North America reflects the shift of the Jewish holidays in the reported quarter compared with the fourth quarter of 2016. Outside North America, the company expects the same to rise in the range of 3% to 5% (earlier increase in the 2–4% band).Adjusted EBITDA is likely to be in the range of $762 million to $777 million, reflecting the negative impact of hotels previously sold.Moreover, the company anticipates fee revenues between $825 million and $835 million (earlier $804-$849 million).

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the year is pegged at $4.14.Comparable system-wide RevPAR is expected to rise 1-2% in North America (same as earlier), increase nearly 5% outside North America (earlier 3-5% increase) and improve 2-3% worldwide (earlier 1-3% rise), on a constant dollar basis.Additionally, Marriott projects fee revenues between $3,287 million and $3,297 million (earlier $3,245-$3,305 million). Compared to the guidance projected earlier, these fee revenue estimates reflect the outperformance in the third quarter, higher worldwide RevPAR guidance and elevated branding and relicensing fees.While operating income is anticipated in the range of $2,485 million to $2,500 million (earlier $2,420-$2,490 million), general, administrative and other expenses are expected to be in the band of $877 million to $882 million (earlier $880-$890 million).Adjusted EBITDA is projected to be between $3,177 million and $3,192 million (earlier $3,131-$3,201 million).

Both occupancy rate and ADR witnessed a rise of 0.5% each.Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) was $524 million, up 11% year over year.

491,HLT,"Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (HLT  -  Free Report) is a leading global hospitality company and operates under a number of leading brands. This hotel company began trading in Dec 2013 and has a significant presence in major hospitality markets across the world.The company has an industry-leading guest loyalty program — Hilton Honors — which serves millions of members worldwide.Hilton’s geographic exposure in the United States along with solid transient business is expected to continue driving RevPAR. Notably, the spin-offs in Jan 2017 have made Hilton a fee-based, capital efficient, and resilient business, which is likely to drive organic growth. However, lingering political uncertainties in some of the regions where the company operates and negative currency translation remains a concern.Investors should note that the consensus estimate for HLT has hardly witnessed any significant movement over the last 60 days. Meanwhile, HLT’s earnings have been mostly strong over the past few quarters. The company outpaced/met the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the past four quarters, with an average beat of 16.18%. Revenues also posted positive surprises in three of the trailing four quarters.Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc.

492,HLT,"Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (HLT  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 numbers on Oct 26, before the opening bell.Last quarter, this leading global hospitality company pulled off a positive earnings surprise of 4%. In fact, the company outpaced/met earnings estimates in all of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 16.18%.Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. QuoteHowever, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-quarter earnings of 50 cents implies a year-over-year decline of nearly 28%. Revenues are pegged at $2.27 billion, 22.8% lower than the prior-year quarter figure.Meanwhile, we note that shares of the company have underperformed its industry post the spin-offs of Park Hotels & Resorts, Inc. (PK  -  Free Report) and Hilton Grand Vacations Inc. (HGV  -  Free Report) from Hilton on Jan 4, 2017. While Hilton’s shares have gained 21.4%, the industry rallied 26.3% since the date.  Will the upcoming earnings release give a boost to Hilton’s stock? Well, this depends largely on whether the firm is able to post a beat in the third quarter.Our proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for Hilton this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Unfortunately, that is not the case here as elaborated below.Zacks ESP: Hilton has an Earnings ESP of -0.67%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Hilton carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company’s negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Notably, we caution you against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Factors Likely to Affect Q3 ResultsHilton has been witnessing growth in its system-wide revenue per available room (RevPAR) over the past few quarters, primarily owing to better-than-expected transient demand and strong group performance. We expect the trend to have continued driving RevPAR in the to-be-reported quarter as well.However, management projects system-wide RevPAR to be flat to up 2% in the to-be-reported quarter owing to an unfavorable calendar shift and the timing of Jewish holidays. Meanwhile, adjusted earnings per share are anticipated to be between 47 cents and 51 cents, while adjusted EBITDA is expected in the band of 490 million to $510 million.Notably, the spin-offs in January 2017 have made Hilton a fee-based, capital efficient and resilient business, which should drive organic growth in the quarter.Resultantly, Hilton expects third-quarter results to be buoyed by strong unit development and tremendous growth in loyalty program given its scale, size, industry-leading brands and commercial platform. Also, the company’s new brands that have been developed at minimal cost have been faring quite well and are expected to propel the quarter’s revenues.Even so, Hilton’s international presence makes it vulnerable to lingering political uncertainties and economic downturns in certain parts of the world. We believe unfavorable currency translations might hurt the top line in the to-be-reported quarter as well.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some other stocks that you may want to consider as these have the right combination of elements to post earnings beat this quarter too.Choice Hotels International, Inc. (CHH  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.26% and a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

493,HLT,"Wyndham Worldwide Corporation  is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 numbers on Oct 25, before market opens.We expect the company’s diversified product portfolio, prudent acquisitions and robust marketing efforts to continue driving the bottom line in the quarter.In fact, in December 2016, the company’s Hotel Group acquired Latin America's leading Fen Hotels while the company’s Vacation Rentals entered into a strategic partnership with Unique Ventures (Veeve). Both these deals are expected to boost sales considerably as they add to the company’s international presence.Meanwhile, increasing business and leisure travel on the back of an improving domestic economy and positive employment numbers are anticipated to boost the quarter’s results.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in the to-be-reported quarter is pegged at $2.01, reflecting an increase of 6.1% over the prior-year quarter. Also, the quarter’s revenues are expected to grow 6% year over year to $1.67 billion.Wyndham Worldwide Corp Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Wyndham Worldwide Corp Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Wyndham Worldwide Corp QuoteSegment ContributionWyndham’s robust vacation ownership or timeshare business is one of the fastest evolving and profitable sectors in the hospitality industry. Banking on its new sales centers, strong affiliation agreements and improved sales and marketing operations, the company expects to generate substantial sales in its vacation ownership business.Thus, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for net revenues in this segment is currently pegged at $791 million, reflecting an increase of more than 6% year over year.Notably, the company is focused on increasing the number of new owners in vacation ownership segment. Although crucial to the long-term health of the business, this move is expected to weigh on the company’s near-term EBITDA. Hence, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for EBITDA in this segment is currently pegged at $192 million, reflecting a modest rise of less than 2% year over year.Meanwhile, Wyndham’s Destination Network business continues to witness strong growth from its Vacation Rental brands with healthy increases in organic unit count, occupancy and price. Performance is expected to continue to be strong in Europe, where the company has been investing heavily in recruiting, services and improving guest experience to drive growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for net revenues in this segment is currently pegged at $515 million, reflecting a rise of 6% year over year.Further, given the solid expansion efforts and improving economic indicators leading to robust demand, Wyndham Hotel Group is expected to post strong revenue growth in the to-be-reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for net revenues in this segment is currently pegged at $380 million, reflecting an improvement of 4% year over year.Other FactorsAlso contributing to the solid revenue growth expectations are Wyndham’s string of initiatives to boost occupancy as well as its strong loyalty program.However, certain headwinds persist in the form of lingering uncertainty in various economies like Brazil and Africa that might limit revenue growth, soft demand in oil producing regions that could hurt revenue per available room (RevPAR) in the third quarter and consumer concerns related to pandemic virus like Zika that may somewhat temper growth in the Caribbean region.Also, given Wyndham’s considerable international operations, negative currency translation might continue hampering the company’s results as it has been doing over the last few quarters.Taking into account the headwinds, our quantitative model predicts that Wyndham does not have the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.Zacks ESP: Wyndham has an Earnings ESP of -0.75%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Wyndham carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we also need a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings beat.Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere are a couple of stocks in the same space, which, as per our model, have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc. (HLT  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.80% and a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Choice Hotels International, Inc. (CHH  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.26% and a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Hyatt Hotels Corporation (H  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +5.26% and a Zacks Rank #3.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

494,HLT,"Regency Centers Corporation (REG  -  Free Report) recently announced the acquisition of Indigo Square in Mt. Pleasant, S.C. The company will develop a 51,000 square-foot retail project on this prime retail land, which will be anchored by GreenWise Market — a Publix Super Markets concept. It will be the second newly restyled GreenWise Market in the Southeast.The move is a strategic fit for Regency as the retail property, when developed, will likely enjoy decent footfall. In fact, purchased from Johnson Development Group, Indigo Square is the retail component of a master development.This development consists of 456 premier multi-family units branded as The Haven at Indigo Square, as well as a Home2Suites select service hotel of the Hilton Worldwide Holdings (HLT  -  Free Report). It also houses a CubeSmart (CUBE  -  Free Report) self-storage facility. These are already operating, while the Regency’s retail development is likely to be unveiled in the fourth quarter next year.This site, along US-17, between I-526 and the Isle of Palms Connector, enjoys easy access to Mt. Pleasant, Daniel Island, Sullivan’s Island, Isle of Palms, and the Charleston Peninsula. In fact, with solid demographics in its surrounding, the property is likely to offer tenants decent scope to enjoy high sales activity.Notably, mall traffic continues to suffer amid rapid shift in consumers’ shopping preferences toward online channels, resulting in an increasing number of retailers jumping on the dot-com bandwagon. These have made retailers reconsider their footprint and eventually opt for store closures in recent times. In fact, the decision to close stores by a number of reputable retailers like Macy's, Inc. (M  -  Free Report) and J. C. Penney Company, Inc. (JCP  -  Free Report), have raised concerns over cash flows of mall landlords.However, at such a time, Regency’s focus on building a premium portfolio of grocery-anchored shopping centers, which are usually necessity driven, augurs well. Such centers are usually necessity driven and drive a dependable traffic.Moreover, groceries mark one of the major categories of U.S. consumer spending. Although online retailers have made efforts to penetrate deeper into the grocery business, only a minimal percentage of U.S. grocery shopping takes place online.The company has considerable experience in the retail real estate industry and has developed several retail real estate projects over the years. Also, on Mar 1, Regency announced closing the Equity One merger deal, a move which created a high-quality portfolio of more than 400 properties, mainly grocery anchored, for Regency. Such strategic acquisitions are anticipated to boost the company’s long-term growth.Regency currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Also, shares of the company have rallied 8.3% in a month’s time and outperformed its industry that ascended 4%.

495,HLT,"Shares of Marriott International (MAR  -  Free Report) have outperformed its industry so far this year. The stock has gained 53.5% as compared to the industry’s 19.6%. Moreover, upward revision in earnings estimates for the current and next year reflects analysts’s unwavering confidence in the company. Over the past one month, current and next year earnings estimates inched up 2.4% and 2.1%, respectively. The company also delivered positive earnings surprises in each of the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 9.11%.Per our VGM Score, which identifies the most attractive value, growth and momentum characteristics, Marriott has a Growth Score of B reflecting the stock’s high growth potential.Driven by a slew of positives, the prospects for this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company make analysts optimistic about the stock.What Makes Marriott an Attractive Pick?Estimated Earnings and Revenues: Arguably, earnings growth is of utmost importance for determining a stock’s potential as surging profit levels are often indicative of strong prospects (and stock price gains). For the current year, Marriott’s earnings per share are expected to grow nearly 11%. Moreover, year-over-year sales growth for the current year is expected at 32.9%.Acquisition of Starwood Hotels & Resorts: Marriott continues to rely on acquisitions in order to expand its footprint. Notably, after the acquisition of Starwood Hotels & Resorts on Sep 23, 2016, Marriott became the world’s largest hotel company. Currently, it has more than 6,400 properties across 126 countries and territories, under 30 brand names.Post-acquisition, shares of the company surged 85.5% while the broader S&P 500 index gained 20%.Boosting Shareholders Wealth: The company has a dividend distribution policy and a share repurchase program in place to boost shareholders’ value. Based on certain assumptions, Marriott expects cash available for shareholders to total $8.3-$9.3 billion for the three years (2017 through 2019). Also, it expects to return $1.4-$1.5 billion to shareholders in dividends, assuming a continued 30% payout ratio and $6.9 to $7.8 billion in share repurchases over the three-year period.Frequent share buybacks and continuous increase in quarterly dividend payments affirm the company’s optimistic outlook and prospects.In fact, Marriott delivered a return on equity (ROE) of 31.6% in the trailing 12 months compared with the industry’s gain of 6.1%. This supports its growth potential and indicates that the company reinvests more efficiently compared to peers.Expansion Strategies: Marriott is consistently trying to expand its presence worldwide and capitalize on the demand for hotels in the international markets. The company plans to significantly grow its global portfolio of luxury and lifestyle brands. Meanwhile, it anticipates gross room additions of 7% in 2018 which is likely to continue building economics, scale and consumer preference for its brands. The company’s continuous expansion plans are likely to add to the top line and drive margins, which in turn makes the company a lucrative investment option. Zacks Rank & Other Stocks to ConsiderMarriott carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Markedly, strength at the company’s international hotels drove the results. Management had projected system-wide RevPAR to be flat to up 2% on a comparable and currency-neutral basis for the quarter.RevPAR at comparable managed and franchised hotels increased 1.1% in the quarter. Both occupancy rate and ADR witnessed a rise of 0.5% each.Adjusted EBITDA was $524 million, up 11% year over year. Adjusted EBITDA margins came in at 56.9%, up 170 basis points year over year.Fourth-Quarter 2017 OutlookShare-based metrics in Hilton's outlook for fourth-quarter and full-year 2017 do not include the effect of potential share repurchases.For the fourth quarter, earnings per share are forecasted between 41 cents and 45 cents.Hilton projects system-wide RevPAR to witness a year-over-year increase of 1% to 3% on a comparable and currency-neutral basis.

While looking back an additional 30 days, we can see even more upward momentum. There have been three moves higher compared to one lower two months ago.VGM ScoresAt this time, Hilton's stock has a poor Growth Score of F, however its Momentum is doing a bit better with a D. Following the exact same course, the stock was allocated also a grade of D on the value side, putting it in the bottom 40% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of F. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Our style scores indicate investors will probably be better served looking elsewhere.OutlookWhile estimates have been trending upward for the stock, the magnitude of this revision has been net zero. The stock has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). We are expecting an above average return from the stock in the next few months.

497,HLT,"Founded in 2008 by Brian Chesky, Joe Gebbia, and Nathan Blecharczyk, Airbnb is an app and website that connects people seeking lodging with renters who have listed their personal houses, apartments, guest rooms, etc., on either platform. Travelers can book accommodations around the world online or from a tablet or mobile phone.Airbnb is an easy way for people to monetize any extra living space they have. With over 3 million listings worldwide—including 1,400 castles—it operates in over 65,000 cities and 191 countries, the company has a total guest list of more than 150 million people.Airbnb as a LifestyleBack in 2014, Airbnb announced a huge, company-wide rebranding, indicating a desire to transition from a hotel service to a lifestyle brand. Since its inception, it has been easy to categorize the company as just another hotel option, taking on big industry names like Wyndham , Hyatt (H  -  Free Report), Hilton Worldwide (HLT  -  Free Report), and InterContinental Hotels (IHG  -  Free Report).But its brand upheaval demonstrates how Airbnb has the potential to be something much more. In a blog post, the company stated they want to possess a logo that will be seen on a variety of products, houses, and businesses, to make sure people understand that whoever owns it is a supporter of their ideal—but, more importantly, a supporter of their brand.Dubbed Bélo, its logo is a symbol of belonging. While it may look like a misshapen paperclip, Bélo is a “symbol for people who want to welcome into their home new experiences, new cultures, and new conversations.” Airbnb has also redesigned its website and app, which are now far cleaner than previous versions, and feature subtle animations and flashier imagery.Controversies to ConsiderAirbnb may present a legitimate challenge to the hotel industry, but the company is enveloped by controversy and regulatory issues in cities that are none too pleased with residents turning their homes into hotels, reflecting similar problems that plague companies like Uber.In San Francisco, critics have blamed Airbnb for the growing vacancy rates and the over $3,900 average monthly rent. Average home prices in the city recently hit the $1.1 million median mark, and San Francisco’s population has reached an all-time high, according to Paragon Real Estate Group.Despite the absence of a permit, which, according to law, one must have in order to rent for under 30 days, San Francisco residents are still illegally listing personal homes and apartments for less than the required number of days on Airbnb. And, legislation was approved in San Francisco last June that would require anyone listing available property on Airbnb or other sites to register the property with the city, most likely hindering a person’s ability to casually list a spare room for some extra cash going forwardThe company is also embroiled in a long-standing battle with New York City, where they face similar issues as in San Francisco. Last fall, the New York State Senate passed a bill that makes online apartment listings for stays shorter than 30 days illegal, which, not surprisingly, thwarts Airbnb in their goal to expand its market.Shortly after, Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed that bill into law, with politicians, local hoteliers, and affordable housing advocates hailing the decision as a victory. Some have calculated that the law has deleted roughly half of Airbnb listings in New York. “To avoid fees, hosts in large apartment buildings can only rent rooms or beds in their houses, not their entire apartment,” notes Travel + Leisure, while hosts who rent entire homes or row houses will not be affected.But Airbnb’s biggest challenge may have been dealing with the #AirbnbWhileBlack controversy, which was a recent protest movement against multiple instances of the company’s hosts apparently declining guests due to skin color. Airbnb admitted that a problem exists, and at the time, said it was trying to tackle the problem by educating hosts and guests, and by responding to concerns they raise.Commenting at the 2016 Fortune Brainstorm Tech conference, CEO Chesky said that “We were so focused on creating trust and safety that we took our eye off the ball on this other important issue,” Chesky said. “There were lots of things we didn’t think about when we, as three white guys, designed the platform.”IPO BuzzSince 2014, and regardless of its fight with certain cities, rumors have been swirling of Airbnb’s inevitable initial public offering, even though CEO Chesky said no to an IPO at that time. In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, Chesky said that “we will do it at a time when it benefits the company, when we have a good reason.”Airbnb’s last valuation clocked in at $31 billion—it’s worth only about $15 billion less than Marriot (MAR  -  Free Report)—thanks to its latest billion-dollar round of equity funding, making it the second most valuable U.S. startup behind Uber. This, as well as being a recognized name in the hotel industry and sharing economy, is helping raise buzz. Their popularity among venture capitalists (VCs) is helping increase hype, too.However, this new round of funding, in addition to a separate deal where investors are planning to buy $200 million in stock from Airbnb employees, could be seen as a move to relieve some of the pressure of filing for an IPO. Airbnb is adding significantly to its amount of available cash, allowing it to spend enough and continue its global expansion without going public.Airbnb is also reportedly watching fellow tech unicorn Spotify, and what IPO route the music streaming giant will take. According to The Wall Street Journal, Airbnb may want to mimic Spotify’s unconventional plans; Spotify is planning to list its shares directly on the New York Stock Exchange without raising a new round of funding (also read: Spotify is Likely Going Public Without an IPO: Will Other Tech Unicorns Follow?)This move benefits private companies who don’t need cash, “but want a way for employees, founders, and other shareholders to start trading their shares,” notes Business Insider.How Might an Airbnb IPO Perform?Thanks to Snap Inc.’s (SNAP  -  Free Report) very successful IPO last March, the spotlight is shining with renewed intensity on startups like Airbnb, and investors are wondering if the online hospitality marketplace will file for an IPO this year.Like other tech companies, Airbnb is a company for the digital age, and many are wanting to be the first ones to invest in its expected success. Billions of dollars have been invested in the digital sharing economy over the past few years—specifically, in companies whose platforms are apps and websites that connect a person selling an item or service with a consumer who wants to use that item or service.Particularly, Airbnb is popular because it is inexpensive to run; it doesn’t have to build or maintain hotels or hotel staff. The company is also easy to grow quickly, as there is no need for a physical office in every country, just consumers with a smartphone.Like any tech startup, Airbnb’s IPO will be a toss-up. Its valuation is impressive in and of itself, and will most likely be the driving factor for investors come time for a public entrance into the market. Airbnb needs to keep an eye on their increasing competition. Companies like Roomorama, Homeaway, and the Expedia (EXPE)-owned Housetrip all have a dedicated following of their own, and are all beginning to eat into the market share.Despite rival companies and regulatory issues, Airbnb has the potential to be one of the hottest upcoming IPOs. With billions of dollars in investments already, a thriving rebranding, and its rising popularity among travelers, Airbnb’s IPO is one to watch out for.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

498,HLT,"Sheraton Hotels & Resorts, part of Marriott International, Inc. (MAR  -  Free Report), recently announced the opening of Sheraton Guangzhou Nansha Hotel. This property is sited in the district of Nansha, which is located in the heart of the Pearl River Delta.Further, the new hotel marks Sheraton’s second property in Guangzhou and the 13th in the Guangdong Province, accentuating the demand and popularity of Marriott's most global brand.The 291-roomed hotel offers magnificent views over Nansha and the Jiaomen River through its floor-to-ceiling windows. It also features a fitness center, a club lounge, outdoor swimming and whirlpool, 11 function rooms, and four food & beverage outlets.Conveniently located in the Guangzhou Nansha free-trade zone, the hotel is an exclusive option for leisure and corporate travelers alike. Also, Nansha is the geographical center within the Shenzhen, Hong Kong & Macao bay area, playing a key role in international trading and financial services.Being the first internationally branded hotel in Nansha, Marriott’s new propertyis expected to further support the development of the region as a trade and business hub.Capitalizing on the Demand in Asia-PacificCurrently, Marriott’s Sheraton brand has about 450 hotels in over 70 countries around the world. We note that Marriott is consistently trying to expand its presence worldwide and capitalize on the demand for hotels in the international markets. In fact, the demand for hotels in these markets is greater than in the domestic space as the rising disposable income, primarily among the middle classes, seems to boost tourism.Notably, China promises immense growth potential within the Asia-Pacific region, despite itscooling economy.To this end, the company recently entered into a joint venture agreement with Alibaba Group Holding Limited (BABA  -  Free Report) — the largest e-commerce platform in the world — to develop a travel storefront that leverages Alibaba's digital travel platform, retail expertise and digital payment platform, Alipay.Meanwhile, as incomes increase, China's middle class is looking toward higher quality products and elevated travel experiences.Markedly, China is the largest source market for outbound travel now. In fact, Chinese outbound travel is set to boom further with 700 million trips projected over the next five years. In sync with this, the company aims to broaden its offerings of guest amenities and services for the Chinese travelers in more hotels.In fact, Marriott anticipates this new joint venture with Alibaba to aid in capturing a greater share of this growing Chinese travel market, grow membership of its loyalty programs and reduce distribution costs. In the meantime, the company continues to focus on expanding its presence in other Asian countries like India, Indonesia, Thailand and Australia, besides China.Bottom LineAccompanied by the boost in the economy and an improvement in business as well as leisure travel, Marriott is well poised to grow in the near as well as long term. The company’s significant international exposure and an aggressive buyback strategy add to the positives.Notably, after announcing the acquisition of Starwood Hotels & Resorts on Sep 23, 2016, Marriott has become the world’s largest hotel company, spanning across 125 countries with more than 6,200 properties. Post-acquisition, shares of the company have surged 67.2% while the S&P 500 index gained 17.1%.Though headwinds persist in the form of lingering political uncertainty in key international markets and currency headwinds, Marriott is well poised to grow in the long term on the back of its continual expansion efforts and an unmatched portfolio of lodging brands.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderMarriott carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked stocks in the same industry include China Lodging Group, Limited (HTHT  -  Free Report) and Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.

499,HLT,"Marriott International, Inc. (MAR  -  Free Report) recently announced the opening of The StateView Hotel in the heart of North Carolina State University's Centennial Campus. Opened in collaboration with Noble Investment Group, the upscale hotel is a part of Marriott’s Autograph Collection Hotels — a distinctive collection of passionately independent hotels.Located on the tranquil setting of the shores of Lake Raleigh, The StateView provides a supreme outdoor experience and an inventive guest experience driven by high-tech technology as well as interactive spaces.Along with 164 guest rooms and suites, the hotel also features a fully equipped business center, innovative chef-driven bar and dining experience and more than 10,000 square feet of state-of-the-art meeting and function space for the modern traveler as well as local community.The StateView is thus a crucial component in the quickly expanding Centennial Campus of North Carolina State University, which is set to house 9 million square feet of top-notch commercial, residential, laboratory and research facilities, upon completion. Notably, the new hotel opening is in line with Marriott’s consistent efforts to expand its presence in the United States as well as international markets, given a steady rise in business and leisure travel.Meanwhile, Autograph Collection flaunts more than 110 luxury lifestyle hotels in nearly 30 countries and territories.In fact, after announcing the acquisition of Starwood Hotels & Resorts on Sep 23, 2016, Marriott has become the world’s largest hotel company. Currently, it has more than 6,200 properties across 125 countries and territories, under 30 brand names. Post-acquisition, shares of the company have also soared 66.8% while the S&P 500 gained 17%.Additionally, the company believes that the linking of three industry-leading guest loyalty programs — Marriott Rewards, Ritz-Carlton Rewards and Starwood Preferred Guest — would lead to an even larger loyalty community. Further, investments in technology for hotel bookings are likely to improve guest experience and thus boost occupancy.However, lingering political uncertainties in key international markets along with currency headwinds remain concerns for Marriott and most of the other hotel chains including Hyatt Hotels Corporation (H  -  Free Report), Hilton Worldwide Holdings (HLT  -  Free Report) and Wyndham Worldwide Corporation .Notwithstanding the headwinds, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s continual expansion efforts and an unmatched portfolio of lodging brands, raises optimism in the stock.

500,HLT,"With focus on augmenting its presence worldwide, Hyatt Hotels Corporation (H  -  Free Report) has large scale expansion and development plans in Asia-Pacific, Europe, Africa, Middle East and Latin America. These markets can help the company gain traction in the hospitality industry, thus boosting its business.In line with such expansion strategies, a Hyatt affiliate recently entered into a management agreement with ORIX Corporation to open a Hyatt Centric hotel and Hyatt House hotel in Kanazawa, Japan’s north coast in the Hokuriku region, in mid-2020.Notably, this will be Hyatt’s first joint development and the first Hyatt House hotel in Japan.Located in close proximity to the JR Kanazawa Station, the key stop on Japan’s newest bullet train route, the hotels will attract guests for both business and tourism purposes. Hyatt Centric Kanazawa will have roughly 250 guest rooms, while Hyatt House Kanazawa will offer 90 apartment-style suites suitable for extended stay. Both the hotels will provide various services and amenities catering to customers’ need and demand, allowing them to enjoy both the brands in one location.Notably, Japan aims to welcome around 40 million tourists annually by 2020. This is because the tourism industry of Japan is expected to grow around the time owing to the Olympics and Paralympics events in Tokyo. Various new projects are being undertaken by hotel developers and institutional investors in Japan as investments in hotels are likely to prove rewarding in the nation, as reported by CNBC. Thus, it is an opportune time for Hyatt to expand its presence in Japan.However, Hyatt might face tough competition from hotel chains like Marriott International, Inc. (MAR  -  Free Report), Wyndham Worldwide Corporation  and Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc. (HLT  -  Free Report) that are looking to expand in these untapped markets. Lingering political uncertainties in some key operating regions and currency headwinds might also restrict revenue growth.Meanwhile, year to date, shares of Hyatt have slightly underperformed its industry — recording a gain of 11% when compared with the industry’s 12.8%.Nevertheless, the company is poised to grow on a strong developmental pipeline along with consistent brand establishment and expansion strategies.Hyatt carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

501,HLT,"Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc. (HLT  -  Free Report) recently announced the opening of its new property in Los Angeles, CA, bringing together two of its upscale brands — Homewood Suites and Curio Collection.The 290-roomed dual-branded property — Homewood Suites by Hilton Los Angeles International Airport and H Hotel Los Angeles — marks the first hotel in the city for both these brands. Meanwhile, it is Homewood Suites’ fourth property in the greater Los Angeles County.Developed and owned by SVI Airport, LLC and managed by Interstate Hotels & Resorts, the property is located in close proximity to the city’s main beaches and attractions. Further, the hotel also offers a flexible meeting space, fitness centers, outdoor pool, food & beverage outlets, as well as an on-site convenience store and grocery shopping service.Being located close to one of the nation’s busiest airports enables Hilton’s new hotel to cater to both business and leisure travelers. Further, Los Angeles has been attracting a large number of tourists – the highest number in the country since the past six years – making it an extremely opportune time to open a property there.Lately, Hilton has been undertaking several dual-branded ventures throughout the United States, Canada, Mexico, South America, Europe and the Middle East, to better serve both travelers and developers. Dual-brand hotels offer larger and enhanced communal areas and amenities than what would be possible for standalone properties, benefiting both business and leisure travelers.Hilton’s newest property also participates in the company’s industry-leading guest loyalty program — Hilton HHonors — which serves millions of members worldwide. The program has proven to be an extremely valuable asset for the company, improving guest experience and thereby driving occupancy.In addition, Hilton’s scale, size, commercial platform and industry-leading brands continue to drive overall unit growth, taking a disproportionate share of the global hotel development activity.Meanwhile, we note that shares of the company have outpaced the broader S&P 500 Index post the spin-offs of Park Hotels & Resorts, Inc. (PK  -  Free Report) and Hilton Grand Vacations Inc. (HGV  -  Free Report) from Hilton on Jan 4, 2017. While the index has gained 12.1%, Hilton’s shares jumped 20.5% since the date. The transaction also transformed the company into a capital-light operating business focused on growing market share, units, free cash flow per share as well as preserving its strong balance sheet and accelerating return of capital. Thus, we are reasonably optimistic on this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company’s prospects in the long run, given its aggressive expansions strategies, asset-light model and industry-leading guest program.Another Key PickAnother stock worth considering in the same industry is China Lodging Group, Limited (HTHT  -  Free Report) with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

502,HLT,"The U.S. hotel industry is set to see continued growth albeit at a decelerating pace for the rest of the year. This is premised on a rise in business and leisure travel along with higher transaction volumes on the back of an improving economy, rising employment, higher real income, and increased household net worth.Even then, peaking supply growth is expected to put pressure on pricing power, thereby tempering the performance somewhat. Another major threat comes from home sharing companies, like Airbnb, Inc., that have made steady inroads into the industry and are grabbing share from giants.Thus, in order to survive in a tough economic environment, hoteliers are continuously devising ways to enhance guest experience and raise occupancy. Of these, offering loyalty programs is one of the best ways.It is to be noted that rewards’ members stay longer than nonmembers and generate more revenues for their franchisees. Also, apart from bracing against the popularity of Airbnb, hotel operators are emphasizing loyalty programs to persuade travelers to book rooms directly through their channels and limit the flow of commission dollars to online travel agents like Expedia Inc., TripAdvisor and The Priceline Group Inc.In fact, loyalty programs have started to play an essential part in determining customer preference for hotels and influence their stay frequency and spending — more than ever before. Consequently, despite the added costs associated with these programs, hoteliers are increasingly focusing on these.Top PlayersAs loyalty becomes a priority for the industry, hotels are doing away with traditional ideas and trying new strategies to lure both short and long-term business.Evidently, all the top players in the hotel space continue to make multiple enhancements to their loyalty programs to make them customer-centric. They do so to add value for guests and the overall system.Notably, Wyndham Worldwide Corporation’s  Wyndham Rewards offers one of the most generous reward program payouts in the industry. Recently, Wyndham became the first hospitality company to globally expand its loyalty program across vacation ownership and vacation rental properties.With over 52-million members, the company expects Wyndham Rewards to generate nearly a third of the incremental tours needed to hit its new owner growth target of 23%. Further, the company has formed an alliance with Caesars Entertainment Corporation (CZR  -  Free Report), which will unite two of the world’s leading hotel and casino loyalty programs.Markedly, post its acquisition of Starwood, Marriott International Inc. (MAR  -  Free Report) has linked industry-leading guest loyalty programs, namely Marriott Rewards, Ritz-Carlton Rewards and Starwood Preferred Guest. It also announced the matching of member status between the programs, thereby leading to an even larger loyalty community. Loyalty programs are Marriott's most powerful marketing platform and it continues to invest in marketing partnerships and innovations designed to provide a more rewarding experience to its guests.It is to be noted that Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (HLT  -  Free Report) has created one of the largest loyalty programs, Hilton Honors. With more than 63 million members, this network has created an extremely valuable asset for the company. In fact, about 57% of all occupancy per night takes place through this member program.In fact, the company recently entered into a partnership with American Express (Amex) in a bid to boost the program’s ability to drive demand. Slated to begin in January 2018, Amex will launch and market a portfolio of Hilton Honors credit cards in the country, which will aid in growing the program’s membership and deepen member engagement.Meanwhile, in first-quarter 2017, Hyatt Hotels Corporation (H  -  Free Report) launched a new loyalty program, World of Hyatt, which replaced its Gold Passport loyalty program. Notably, World of Hyatt is a platform for guest engagement. Given these enhancements, the company expects the program to build even higher levels of guest preference and help in sustaining market share gains.Choice Hotels International, Inc.’s (CHH  -  Free Report) loyalty program, Choice Privileges, is rapidly expanding and continues to drive guest to its franchisees’ hotels. The program recently surpassed 32 million members and has already added more than 2.5 million new members this year.In fact, as per a recent study conducted by Ideaworks Company last week, Wyndham Rewards is touted to be the most-rewarding loyalty program in the U.S. hotel industry with an average return of 16.7% in value on every dollar spent on a room booking, followed by Marriott Rewards and Hilton Honors.While Hilton has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), Wyndham, Marriott, Hyatt and Choice Hotels currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Bottom LineOver the past six months, the Zacks Hotels and Motels industry has fared better than the broader S&P 500 index. While the industry has gained 22.1%, the broader index has added only 8.4%.Going forward, hoteliers need to be smart enough to capitalize on the shifting trends and adapt to new consumer expectations.Given that loyalty programs are the key to better brand experience, hoteliers must continuously reengineer these to provide a more fulfilling experience. Loyalty will follow automatically.Also, as loyalty programs offer greater flexibility and personalization, these may incentivize repeat bookings and lead to long-term revenue growth.Thus, loyalty programs are likely to play a key role in moving the industry even higher than its current position at the top 31% among the 265 Zacks industries.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

The latest signing of this hotel in Rome follows the rising demand of luxury travel and endorses unstoppable growth of the brand in the European region.  W Hotels presently operates seven properties in the region with 10 new hotels in the pipeline. While W Tel Aviv is likely to be launched in early 2018, W Hotels in Madrid, Belgrade and Portugal's spectacular Algarve coast are projected to open in 2019, followed by Prague and Budapest in 2020. Also, W Hotels is scheduled to mark its entry in Marbella and Edinburgh in 2021, along with Rome.Meanwhile, it is to be noted that in addition to domestic lands, Marriott is consistently trying to expand its presence worldwide and capitalize on the demand for hotels in the international markets, especially in Asia, Latin America, Middle East and Africa.The company’s European pipeline has also grown consistently in the recent past and is expected to continue, going forward. By 2020, Marriott aims to expand its lead in the luxury and full-service segments in the region, have the largest portfolio in the upscale division and also win over millennials in the affordable lifestyle group.In fact, after announcing the acquisition of Starwood Hotels & Resorts on Sep 23, 2016, Marriott has become the world’s largest hotel company.

Of the six, four mark the brand’s entry into new countries while two of them increase its footprint in already explored lands.Notably, the Hyatt Regency brand is anticipated to debut in Algiers, Algeria in late 2018; Douala, Cameroon in late 2020; and Addis Ababa, Ethiopia in the summer of 2018. The brand will also open a hotel in Arusha, Tanzania in early 2019, marking Hyatt’s third property in the country. The Hyatt Centric brand will debut in Dakar, Senegal in the summer of 2019. Meanwhile, a Park Hyatt brand hotel will open in Marrakech, Morocco in 2019, which will be the company’s third property in the country.Moreover, as part of its long-term plan to expand in Sub-Saharan Africa, Hyatt will continue looking forward to further opportunities across countries including Rwanda, Kenya, Uganda, Mozambique, Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire.In fact, the company believes that there are significant development opportunities in Africa. Also, tourist and business travel is expected to rise with the launch of a Pan-African, visa-free passport next year along with enhanced connectivity and growth in the region’s airlines.Going forward, East Africa — one of Hyatt’s primary focus areas — is expected to largely benefit from a growing middle class, the government’s infrastructural investmentsand an escalating international recognition of the region’s stability. These contributed toward 11% growth in Sub-Saharan African tourism in 2016 itself. Further, per UNWTO World Tourism Barometer, as reported by Hyatt the first-half of 2017 witnessed a 14% rise in international arrivals in East Africa year over year, while intra-Africa travel rose nearly 13%.With the upsurge in tourism in the region, the demand for hotels is expected to improve, thereby making it an opportune time to invest in this space.However, the company could face tough competition from other hotel chains like Marriott International, Inc. (MAR  -  Free Report), Wyndham Worldwide Corporation  and Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc. (HLT  -  Free Report), who are also looking to expand into these untapped markets. Lingering political uncertainty in some key operating regions and currency headwinds might also restrict revenue growth.Notably, shares of Hyatt have underperformed its industry recording a gain of 13.3%, compared with the industry’s 20.1% growth in the past six months.Nevertheless, the company is well poised to grow in the near as well as long term, given a strong developmental pipeline along with consistent brand establishment and expansion strategies.Hyatt carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company.

Although the increasing supply growth is expected to limit occupancy levels, overall demand conditions in the United States is anticipated to remain positive on the back of firming group travel, going forward.In the meantime, Wyndham continues to generate room-rate gains in the domestic upscale and midscale segments with an increase in occupancy. The strong demand witnessed over the past two years is likely to increase pricing power, moving ahead.Wyndham Hotel Group also seeks to grow its worldwide management operations and distribution system as it looks for new development opportunities and tactical brand acquisitions globally.To this end, the company completed the buyout of Fen Hotels, significantly expanding its presence in Latin America. Before that, it had acquired Dolce Hotels and Resorts, a leading provider and manager of group accommodations across seven countries in Europe and North America.Notably, the acquisition of AmericInn is expected to strengthen Wyndham Hotel Group’s existing portfolio of more than 1,500 midscale hotels as well as significantly increase its footprint in Midwestern U.S. Also, management believes that investing in the midscale segment is most opportune at the moment as the global middle class is anticipated to more than double over the next 10 years.Spin-Off of Hotel GroupOn Aug 3, 2017, Wyndham announced its plan to spin off the company's hotel business — Wyndham Hotel Group — resulting in two separate publicly traded companies. The transaction is expected to be completed in the first half of 2018.In fact, the company believes that the spin-off of its Hotel Group business and the combination of Vacation Ownership segment with RCI is the best structure to unlock shareholder value and enable strong long-term growth across the businesses.Bottom LineWyndham’s shares have surged 57.3% over the past year compared with the industry’s growth of 29%.Yet, lingering political uncertainties in key international markets along with currency headwinds remain concerns for Wyndham as well as most of the other hotel chains including Marriott International, Inc.

The company is consistently trying to expand its presence worldwide and capitalize on the demand for hotels in both domestic and international markets.Most recently, The Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company, L.L.C — a wholly-owned subsidiary of Marriott — announced the opening of The Ritz-Carlton, Langkawi, in Malaysia.The hotel, which includes 70 guest rooms, 15 suites and 29 villas, offers amenities like exotic dining venues, fitness centers, swimming pools and spas. Additionally, incorporating tinctures of the local culture in a modern setting, the hotel marks the company’s first resort destination in Malaysia and the second property in the country.Notably, Marriott’s aggressive expansion strategies position the company well in terms of revenue growth. The company plans to significantly grow its global portfolio of luxury and lifestyle brands, targeting net room additions of 6% in 2017. Further, the acquisition of Starwood Hotels & Resorts on Sep 23, 2016, has made Marriott the world’s largest hotel.Moreover, given strong transient demand along with improvements in business and leisure travel, we believe Marriott is poised to grow in the near as well as long term.

510,HLT,"Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (HLT  -  Free Report) recently announced the opening of Hilton Huizhou Longmen Resort, the first Hilton property in China with natural hot springs.Developed by Guangzhou R&F Properties Co., Ltd and maintained by Hilton, the property is located in Yonghan Town of Longmen County and has easy access to the Guangzhou or Baiyun International Airport. Notably, the 366-guest roomed hotel marks a significant expansion of Hilton's resort footprint in Southern China.We note that the stock has rallied 30.3% in the last six months, significantly outperforming the industry’s gain of 28.2% and S&P 500’s growth of 10.3%.Strategic Expansion in ChinaThe opening of Huizhou Longmen Resort is in line with Hilton’s expansion policy. It is expected to boost the company’s brand portfolio, which comprises 14 world-class brands with more than 5,100 properties. The hotels and resorts, situated in about 103 countries and territories, have nearly 838,000 rooms. Hilton has a geographic diversity which lowers the effect of volatility in individual markets. Thus, the company is capable of capitalizing on the strong demand in China and is optimistic about driving net unit growth in the country.Per a recent report by Euromonitor International, China is the largest tourism source market in terms of spending. Largely because of the increase in GDP per capita and the rise of middle-class households, tourism expenditure is expected to rise 10.9% in the 2017-2022 period. Evidently, in a bid to cash in on the China market, Hilton is eyeing the Asia-Pacific region as well and is expected to deliver solid Revenue Per Available Room (RevPAR) growth in the global market.Focus on Enhancing Customer LoyaltyThe new hotel seems to be part of Hilton’s strategy to enhance customer loyalty, primarily because it is under Hilton Honors — one of the largest loyalty programs. With about 70 million members, this network has emerged as a valuable asset for the company. In fact, about 57% of all occupancy per night takes place through this membership program. The company is focused on making multiple enhancements to its loyalty program in order to make it more customer-centric, driving incremental value for guests and the overall system.To ConcludeRelentless expansion and efforts to fortify global presence make Hilton a major hotelier, which is continuously gaining momentum and is set to become the world's largest hospitality company.Additionally, Hilton has strong fundamentals and cash flow position, which are beneficial for shareholders. In order to return more to shareholders, the company has opted for a more capital-light operating business model backed by the spin-off of a portfolio of hotels and resorts as well as its timeshare business.Zacks Rank & Other Stocks to ConsiderHilton carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Other top-ranked stocks in the Consumer Discretionary sector are InterContinental Hotels Group PLC (IHG  -  Free Report), Choice Hotels International, Inc.

511,HLT,"Hospitality highflyer Marriott International, Inc. (MAR  -  Free Report) has exhibited outstanding price performance in 2017. Year to date, the stock has returned a whopping 65.1% compared with the industry’s gain of 27.8%.Further, Marriot delivered a ROE of 31.6% in the trailing 12 months compared with the industry’s 27.5%. This shows that the company has a more efficient profit generation and reinvestment capacity compared to peers.The third quarter earnings beat, upgraded guidance for 2017 and an encouraging view for 2018 makes us increasingly optimistic about the stock. Let’s see what the New Year holds in store for Marriot.Increased Travel Demand to Drive GrowthGlobal travel is estimated to increase at a 7% compounded rate over the next 10 years and international trips are expected to top $1.8 billion by 2030. We believe that Marriott is well positioned to take advantage of the projected growth.Given a steady rise in business and leisure travel, and higher transaction volumes, Marriott is well-poised to grow in 2018.  It stands to benefit from its strong global footprint and an unmatched portfolio of lodging brands.Acquisitions to Contribute SignificantlyThe Starwood acquisition completed in September 2016 is expected to be accretive to cash flow and earnings by 2018, and result in annual cost savings of at least $250 million on the back of lower operating and general & administrative expenses. Marriott intends to keep expansion rate at the same level as it was before the acquisition. This will effectively mean faster growth for the Starwood brands, moving forward.Also, the company is expected to reap the benefits of increasing accountability, quality assurance, and capital investments in acquired brands such as Sheraton, W and Aloft through 2018. Notably, the company has signed 3,500 new Sheraton rooms in the last 12 months alone, with representation from all continents. The momentum is expected to continue in 2018.With the Protea Hospitality Group buyout in 2014, the company became the largest hotel company in Africa and has nearly doubled its presence in the Middle East and Africa region. We believe thae these acquisitions will help the company to carry on its strategy of expanding its portfolio worldwide through 2018. Interestingly, even with 30 brands under its portfolio, the company has not ruled out further M&A activities.Marriott International Net Income (TTM) Marriott International Net Income (TTM) | Marriott International QuoteRobust Expansion Plans Marriott plans to significantly grow its global portfolio of luxury and lifestyle brands and anticipates gross room additions of 7% in 2018. This is likely to build economics, scale, and consumer preference for its brands.Also, with the increasing number of managed and franchised limited service hotels in Mexico, Colombia and Brazil, the company expects its distribution in the Caribbean and Latin American region to increase 75% by 2018.In August 2017, the company entered into a joint venture agreement with Alibaba to develop a travel storefront that leverages Alibaba's digital travel platform, retail expertise, and digital payment platform, Alipay. Through 2018, we expect this joint venture to aid in capturing a greater share of the growing Chinese travel market, increase membership of its loyalty programs and reduce distribution costs.Loyalty Programs to Support Customer AcquisitionMarriott has an industry-leading guest loyalty programs – Marriott Rewards, Ritz-Carlton Rewards and Starwood Preferred Guest. In 2018, the company aims to merge its loyalty programs into one to form an even larger loyalty community and provide a more rewarding experience to the guests.  Loyalty programs are Marriott's most powerful marketing platform and it continues to invest in marketing partnerships and innovations.Asset Sale to Provide Stable Growth ProfileWe expect regular asset sale to continue through 2018, further strengthening Marriott’s financial flexibility. The sale of assets helps the company to grow through management and licensing arrangements, instead of direct ownership of selective assets. However, Marriott continues to manage the properties post sale. A higher concentration of franchise fees reduces earnings volatility and provides a more stable growth profile.Upward Estimate Revisions for 2018Analysts have increased their estimates for the company for the next year, which makes the earnings picture favorable. Over the past 60 days, nine estimates have gone up compared with one downward revision for the next year. This trend has caused the consensus estimate to trend higher, going from $4.70 a share 60 days ago to its current level of $4.79 for the next year.Zacks Rank and Growth ScoreThe company has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and a Growth Score of B, indicating that it is an impressive choice for growth investors.Key PicksSome other top-ranked stocks in the hotels and motels space include Hilton Worldwide Holdings (HLT  -  Free Report), Choice Hotels International (CHH  -  Free Report) and Intercontinental Hotels Group (IHG  -  Free Report), each carrying a Zacks Rank #2.Long-term earnings per share growth rate for Hilton Worldwide, Choice Hotels and Intercontinental Hotels Group is projected to be 5%, 9.5% and 9.3%, respectively.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

512,HLT,"More Americans will hit the roads or take to the skies this Thanksgiving weekend, a number that would surpass the levels of the past 12 years. Traveling by car, train or plane is in the cards, courtesy of an uptick in personal income and steady wage growth. Upbeat consumer confidence and a healthier economy are also fueling the travel boom.

Another profitable investment options are hotel and resort companies. More travel will lead to increased hotel occupancy and in turn revenue per available room.Thanksgiving Travel to Hit 12-Year HighAccording to the American Automobile Association (AAA), about 50.9 million travelers are expected to travel 50 miles or more, the highest since 2005. Thanksgiving travel is anticipated to increase 3.3% from last year.About 89% or 45.5 million travelers are expected to travel by car, hinting at an increase of 3.2% over the last Thanksgiving weekend. Modes of transport including cruises, trains and buses are expected to make up 1.1% of all travel this Thanksgiving, serving around 1.48 million travelers.However, 3.95 million travelers are expected to opt for flights, which is 5% higher than the year-ago level. Flights are expected to account for 9.9% of all travel this Thanksgiving.Airports to Be Busy, Pre-Tax Profits SolidThe industry trade organization for U.S. airlines, Airlines for America (A4A) sounded even more optimistic. They expect about 28.5 million passengers to take to the skies over the 12-day Thanksgiving holiday period that stretches from Nov 17 to Nov 28, up 3% from 2016. On average, additional 69,000 travelers are expected to fly each day, compared to the same period last year. The trade organization expects Nov 26 to be the busiest, with an estimated 2.88 million passengers.A4A Vice President and Chief Economist John Heimlich said that “airline passengers continue to benefit from the highly competitive air-service landscape this holiday season, as low fares and increased availability of seats continue to make air travel widely accessible.”Collectively, all major airlines including Alaska, Allegiant, American, Delta, Hawaiian, JetBlue, Southwest, Spirit and United had posted a healthy pre-tax profit of around $14.7 billion during the first nine months of this year and operating revenues for the group jumped 3.8%.Will Travel Become Expensive?Airfares are expected to fall 23% this Thanksgiving compared to the previous year. For the top 40 domestic flight routes, average airfares may come in at $157 this year, according to AAA’s Leisure Travel Index.Gasoline prices during Thanksgiving are expected to reach $2.53 a gallon. Even though this is the highest since 2014, it is far below the all-time high of $3.44 in 2012. In fact, gasoline prices are expected to drop as the effects of hurricanes and other disruptions began to wane. This possibly explains why so many Americans are willing to travel by road. As the bulk of the travel is expected to be via road, rental car giant Avis Budget is poised to be among the biggest gainers.Meanwhile, average stay in a Two Diamond Hotel will cost 5% lower this year at $117. Conversely, the cost of a Three Diamond hotel is expected to increase 14% to $176 per night. Rise in prices, however, shouldn’t be a deterrent to travelers, thanks to the increase in wages and personal income.What’s Boosting Travel This Thanksgiving?Rise in income levels is driving the travel industry. Average hourly earnings increased 2.4% from October 2016 to October 2017.Personal income, in the meanwhile, increased by $66.9 billion, or 0.4%, in September, while disposable personal income that measures the total amount of money available for use after payment of taxes rose by $73.6 billion, or 2.1%, in the third quarter, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis.5 Stocks to Ride the Thanksgiving RushWith the rise in income levels, people are willing to spend more on travel this holiday period. As travel volumes are expected to shoot up, investing in travel and leisure companies seems profitable. Increase in travel will surely lead to an uptick in demand for air tickets and hotel rooms.

513,HLT,"Wyndham Hotel Group, one of the three business units of Wyndham Worldwide Corporation , recently announced its plans to open a dual-branded hotel in the Brickell district of Miami. This 445-room hotel will bring the company’s two brands — upper-upscale Wyndham Grand and select-service, lifestyle TRYP by Wyndham — under one banner.Owned by Brazilian developer Galwan and designed by Aquitechtonica, this latest hotel is anticipated to open in late 2019.The 41-story hotel will offer 200 rooms under Wyndham Grand and will mark the brand's fourth hotel in Florida, joining established resorts in Clearwater Beach, Orlando and Jupiter. Meanwhile, TRYP by Wyndham that will be featuring 245 rooms adds to the brands existing portfolio in Florida, which incorporates locations in Fort Lauderdale and St. Augustine.Notably, dual-branded hotels seem to be the latest trend among major hotel chains. Apart from helping the parent company to reduce costs, multiple hotel brands in one location offer tourists the access to a wide range of amenities. In fact, nearly 400 dual-branded hotels are now open or under construction in the United States. Given the benefits associated with it, the number is likely to grow at a swift pace over the next several years as tourists seek personalized experiences.Meanwhile, Miami continues to be one of the world's most desirable travel destinations with roughly 16 million visitors last year and anticipated increases for the years ahead. Consequently, making it an opportune time for Wyndham to open a dual-branded hotel in Miami.Notably, Wyndham boasts a significant presence in most of the hospitality markets in the United States and abroad. The company’s global portfolio consists of more than 8,300 hotels in 78 countries.On Aug 3, 2017, Wyndham announced its plan to spin off the company's hotel business — Wyndham Hotel Group — resulting in two separate publicly traded companies. The transaction is expected to be completed in the first half of 2018. The company believes that the spin-off of its Hotel Group business and the combination of Vacation Ownership segment with RCI is the best structure to unlock shareholder value and enable strong long-term growth across the businesses.In fact, this transaction is anticipated to increase the fit, focus and strategic flexibility of both the post spin-off companies, facilitate prospective capital raising and position them to better respond to developments in their respective markets.Over the past year, Wyndham’s shares have surged 47.4% compared with the industry’s growth of 27.4%. Yet, lingering political uncertainties in key international markets along with currency headwinds remain concerns for Wyndham as well as most of the other hotel chains including Marriott International, Inc. (MAR  -  Free Report), Hilton Worldwide Holdings (HLT  -  Free Report) and Hyatt Hotels Corporation (H  -  Free Report).Nevertheless, we expect this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company’s strong developmental pipeline, consistent expansion plans and large international exposure to continue driving growth in the long haul.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Zacks' Hidden TradesWhile we share many recommendations and ideas with the public, certain moves are hidden from everyone but selected members of our portfolio services.

This hotel company began trading in Dec 2013 and has a significant presence in major hospitality markets across the world.The company has an industry-leading guest loyalty program — Hilton Honors — which serves millions of members worldwide.Hilton’s geographic exposure in the U.S., solid transient business as well as its improving group business trends will continue to drive RevPAR. Notably, the spin-offs in Jan 2017 have made Hilton a fee-based, capital efficient, and resilient business, which should drive organic growth. However, lingering political uncertainties in some of the regions where the company operates and negative currency translation remains a concern.Investors should note that the consensus estimate for HLT has hardly witnessed any significant movement over the last 60 days. Meanwhile, HLT’s earnings have been mostly strong over the past few quarters. The company outpaced/met the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the past four quarters, with an average beat of 9.89%. Revenues also posted positive surprises in three of the trailing four quarters.Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc.

515,HLT,"Shares of JAKKS Pacific, Inc. (JAKK  -  Free Report) hit a 52-week low of $2.25 on Dec 27. The stock has declined a massive 54.4%, year to date in contrast to the industry’s gain of 42.4%.Currently, JAKKS Pacific faces quite a few challenges. Let’s have a look at the factors that have resulted in the new low for the stock.Challenging Retail EnvironmentThe company is bearing the brunt of declining demand for traditional toys. The retail environment for toys is marked by lower consumer confidence, especially in Europe, where the economic/political conditions are anticipated to be more tough post Brexit.In the United States, despite moderate improvement in economic growth, consumers are raising their discretionary spending only modestly as the surge in job growth is yet to translate into significantly higher wages.Consumer spending uncertainty remains a lingering concern because of higher health care costs and reduced credit availability. Therefore, customers are reducing non-essential purchases, thereby hurting JAKKS Pacific’s revenues.Lowered Guidance for the Full YearJAKKS Pacific had to lower its 2017 guidance owing to a bankruptcy filing by its partner and retailer, Toys ‘R’ Us. The company now expects to incur a net loss and record negative earnings per share for the full year.Also, though it continues to expect positive EBITDA for the year, the figure is anticipated to be lower year over year. Though the company expects Toys ‘R’ Us to be a healthier retailer 2018 onward, the near-term effects of the bankruptcy and consequent stalling of shipments will weigh on its performance.Margins to Stay Under Pressure The company is experiencing increased costs related to international expansion, development of new IP and acquisitions. These initiatives are adding to its expenses without any material impact on revenues. Unless the trend reverses, JAKKS Pacific’s margins will remain under pressure, despite several cost-containment efforts.JAKKS Pacific, Inc. Gross Margin (TTM) JAKKS Pacific, Inc. Gross Margin (TTM) | JAKKS Pacific, Inc. QuoteAnalysts Pessimistic As WellThe company has incurred losses in eight of the trailing 11 quarters. Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the bottom line has declined from earnings to loss for the current quarter as well as the current year in the past two months. Given the challenging retail environment for toys, which is hurting the company’s sales, we remain doubtful about notable improvement in the stock's performance.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderJAKKS Pacific has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Some better-ranked stocks in the Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector include Hilton Worldwide Holdings (HLT  -  Free Report), Choice Hotels International (CHH  -  Free Report) and Intercontinental Hotels Group (IHG  -  Free Report), each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Long-term earnings per share growth rate for Hilton Worldwide, Choice Hotels and Intercontinental Hotels is projected to be 5%, 9.5% and 9.3%, respectively.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - Q1 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 11X over.

516,HLT,"Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (HLT  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 numbers on Jul 26, before the opening bell.Last quarter, this leading global hospitality company pulled off positive earnings surprise of 35.71%. In fact, the company outpaced/met earnings estimates in three of the trailing four-quarters with an average beat of 9.89%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. QuoteFactors Likely to Affect Q2 ResultsHilton witnessed growth in its system-wide revenue per available room (RevPAR) in the first quarter, primarily owing to better-than-expected transient demand and strong group performance. We expect the trend to have continued driving RevPAR in the to-be-reported quarter, as well.System-wide RevPAR growth is projected to be in the band of 1—3% in the second quarter. However, the unfavorable calendar shift is likely to result in growth in the lower half of the range. Meanwhile, adjusted earnings are anticipated to be between 47 cents and 51 cents, while adjusted EBITDA (Earnings before Interest, Tax, Depreciation, and Amortization) is expected in the band of 490 million to $510 million.Notably, the spin-offs in Jan 2017 have made Hilton a fee-based, capital efficient, and resilient business, which should drive organic growth in the to-be-reported quarter.Resultantly, Hilton expects second-quarter results to be buoyed by strong unit development and tremendous growth in loyalty program given its scale, size, industry-leading brands and commercial platform. Also, the company’s new brands that have been developed at minimal cost have been faring quite well and are expected to propel the quarter’s top line.However, Hilton’s international presence makes it vulnerable to lingering political uncertainties and economic downturns in certain parts of the world. We believe unfavorable currency translations could hurt the top line in the to-be-reported quarter as well.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for Hilton this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Unfortunately, that is not the case here as elaborated below.Zacks ESP: Hilton has an Earnings ESP of -2.00%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is 49 cents, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged higher at 50 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Hilton currently holds a Zacks Rank #2, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company’s negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Notably, we caution you against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies to consider as our model shows they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Live Nation Entertainment, Inc. (LYV  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +31.25% and a Zacks Rank #3. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.SeaWorld Entertainment, Inc. (SEAS  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +5.88% and a Zacks Rank #3.Wyndham Worldwide Corporation  has an Earnings ESP of +1.33% and a Zacks Rank #3.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

517,HLT,"Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (HLT  -  Free Report) recently announced that its Home2 Suites by Hilton brand has opened Home2 Suites by Hilton Miramar Ft. Lauderdale.  This is the 200th property by Home2 Suites, which the company had planned to open by the end of 2017.Notably, in itsRoad to Home200, held in September, Home2 Suites had invited hotel journalists to predict which out of 385 pending locations would mark its 200th hotel. Given the rapid pace of launching new hotels, there were more than 60 locations that had chances of becoming the 200thproperty.We observe that the stock has rallied 28.8% in the last six months, significantly outperforming the S&P 500’s gain of 11%.Brand Portfolio Expansion as Key Growth DriverThe move appears to be a part of Hilton’s efforts to gain traction in urban and suburban locations. It is expected to significantly boost the company’s brand portfolio, which already consists of 14 world-class brands, comprising more than 5,100 properties with nearly 838,000 rooms in 103 countries and territories. Moreover, the portfolio continues to spread in the domestic market.The company eyes net unit growth of approximately 6.5% for 2017 and have more rooms under construction than any other hotel chain.Home2 Suites has an innovative and flexible construction model, which has already helped the brand enter major urban centers such as Los Angeles and Downtown Columbus, Ohio. Hilton, by capitalizing on the multi-brand building model, is also expanding its urban footprint in Chicago and downtown Columbia, which have high barriers to entry.Focus on Enhancing Customer LoyaltyThe new hotel also seems to be a part of Hilton’s bid to enhance customer loyalty, more so because Home2 Suites is a part of Hilton Honors, one of the largest loyalty programs. With about 70 million members, this network has emerged a highly valuable asset for the company. In fact, about 57% of all occupancy per night takes place through this membership program. The company is focused on making multiple enhancements to its loyalty program in order to make it more customer-centric, driving incremental value for guests and the overall system.Last WordsRelentless expansion and strategic vision to fortify its presence globally as well as domestically, makes Home2 Suites a significant brand for Hilton, which is continuously gaining momentum.Additionally, Hilton maintains strong fundamentals and cash flow position, which are beneficial to its shareholders. In order to return more to shareholders, the company has opted for a more capital-light operating business model backed by the spin-off of a portfolio of hotels and resorts, as well as its timeshare business.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderHilton currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Other top-ranked stocks in the Consumer Discretionary sectorare Marriott International, Inc. (MAR  -  Free Report), Choice Hotels International, Inc. (CHH  -  Free Report) and Clarus Corporation (CLAR  -  Free Report).

518,HLT,"Shares of leading global hospitality company, Wyndham Worldwide Corporation , have outperformed the Zacks categorized Hotels & Motels industry in the last six months. While the stock has surged 30.4%, the industry gained 12.8% in the said period.In fact, propelling the growth trajectory forward is Wyndham’s announcement of the acquisition of Minnesota-based AmericInn hotel brand and its management company, Three Rivers Hospitality, from Northcott Hospitality. As a result, AmericInn will be a part of Wyndham Hotel Group, which is one of the three hospitality business units of Wyndham.Inside the HeadlinesThe $170 million deal, which is subject to regulatory and government approval, and the satisfaction of other customary closing conditions, is a huge positive for Wyndham. The acquisition of AmericInn is expected to add 200 hotels across 21 states, predominately in the Midwestern U.S., Ohio Valley, and Mountain states. Moreover, AmericInn’s U.S. pipeline currently consists of 23 hotels, reflecting ongoing expansion efforts.Particularly, this agreement is expected to bolster Wyndham Hotel Group’s existing portfolio of more than 1,500 midscale hotels as well as significantly increase its footprint in Midwestern US. Also, management believes that investing in the midscale segment is most opportune at the moment as the global middle class is expected to more than double over the next ten years.Remarkably, Wyndham Hotel Group has the highest number of hotels in the world to its name now. Being a leading hotel brand franchisor and hotel management services provider, the company's global portfolio consists of more than 8,000 hotels across 79 countries. In fact, Wyndham Hotel Group's portfolio of brands will grow to 20 with the addition of AmericInn.Rationale BehindGiven the improving economic indicators in the U.S., the demand for hotels has started to grow. Meanwhile, Wyndham is generating room-rate gains in the domestic upscale and midscale segments with an increase in occupancy. The strong demand witnessed over the last two years is likely to increase pricing power in the near term.Wyndham Hotel Group seeks to grow its worldwide management operations and distribution system as it looks for new development opportunities and tactical brand acquisitions globally.Last year, it completed the buyout of Fen Hotels, significantly expanding its presence in Latin America. Before that, the company had acquired Dolce Hotels and Resorts, a leading provider and manager of group accommodations across seven countries in Europe and North America.Our TakeWe are particularly positive on the company’s prudent acquisitions, which strengthen its portfolio across all segments. This coupled with its strong developmental pipeline, consistent expansion plans and large international exposure should continue driving growth, going forward.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderWyndham Worldwide currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Better-ranked stocks in the Hotels & Motels Industry include Choice Hotels International, Inc. (CHH  -  Free Report), Extended Stay America, Inc. (STAY  -  Free Report) and Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc. (HLT  -  Free Report). While Choice Hotels sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Extended Stay and Hilton hold a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.In the trailing four quarters, Choice Hotels, Extended Stay and Hilton have pulled off an average positive earnings surprise of 5.02%, 21.11% and 9.89%, respectively.3 Top Picks to Ride the Hottest Tech TrendZacks just released a Special Report to guide you through a space that has already begun to transform our entire economy...Last year, it was generating $8 billion in global revenues.

519,HLT,"First-quarter 2017 ushered in good news for the U.S. hotel industry with solid demand supporting modest growth in both occupancy and average daily rate (ADR). Revenue per available room (RevPAR) also increased 3.4%.Rising employment, higher real income, and increased household net worth has reinforced consumer confidence and sentiment. This has resulted in a steady rise in business and leisure travel, and higher transaction volumes, which most likely continued in the second quarter.Negative sentiments related to traveling to and from the U.S., a decline in international inbound travel, and a strengthening dollar are acting as the major spoilers for the domestic hotel industry. Yet, it will be reasonable to take a favorable view of the lodging industry’s supply-demand fundamentals given the improving U.S. and global economic outlook.Particularly, confident consumers bode well for hotels despite the surge of new inventory in the marketplace. In fact, the Consumer Confidence Index climbed from May’s reading of 117.6 to 118.9 in June. We anticipate this positive sentiment to translate into higher consumer spending, which, in turn, should drive growth.Moreover, hoteliers are trying every trick in the book to adapt to changing consumer expectations and entice them with their diverse portfolio of travel offerings.Thus, though industry-wide headwinds continue to weigh on investor sentiment, hotel companies have good reasons to remain optimistic about this earnings season.What to Expect?The Zacks categorized Hotels and Motels industry belongs to the broader Consumer Discretionary sector. Per the latest Earnings Trends, as of Jul 12, a mere 5.7% of the Consumer Discretionary companies in the S&P 500 index have reported their results. Earnings and revenues for these companies have recorded year-over-year growth of 14% and 5.6%, respectively. In fact, they’re unblemished with earnings as well as revenue beat ratio of 100%.However, overall earnings for the sector in second-quarter 2017 are expected to be down 1.6% year over year while revenues are likely to surge 7.8%.While the readings suggest that the overall sector might not fare too well in this earnings season, there are still a few major hotel companies within the sector that are expected to reflect resilience. Therefore, this is the right time for you to select hotel stocks that have the potential to beat earnings in their upcoming second-quarter releases.In spite of the headwinds, these stocks are well positioned in today’s market environment. We believe, earnings beat should further help these stocks gain investor confidence, thereby paving the way for stock price appreciation.How to Screen the Outperformers?Choosing the most rewarding stocks within the hotel industry might be difficult unless one knows the trick to shortlist. One way to do it is by picking stocks that have the combination of a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold), and a positive Earnings ESP.  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Earnings ESP is our proprietary methodology for determining which stocks have the best chance of pulling a surprise in their next earnings announcement. It shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Our research shows that for stocks with this combination, the chance of a positive earnings surprise is as high as 70%.3 Prominent PicksFor investors seeking to apply this strategy to their portfolio, below are the three hotel stocks that may stand out this season:Our first choice is Wyndham Worldwide Corporation . This hospitality company is engaged in offering individual and business customers a range of hospitality products and services across various accommodation alternatives and price ranges through its premier portfolio of global brands.Wyndham posted a 2.70% positive earnings surprise in the previous quarter. Moreover, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters at an average of 2.64%.For the upcoming release, the company has an Earnings ESP of +0.67% and a Zacks Rank #3. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter’s earnings is pegged at $1.50.The company is set to report second-quarter results on Aug 3 before the opening bell.Next is Marriott Vacations Worldwide Corporation (VAC  -  Free Report), a developer, marketer, seller and manager of vacation ownership resorts and vacation club, destination club and exchange programs, principally under the Marriott and Ritz-Carlton brands and trademarks.Last quarter, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 3.39%. However, the trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise is a negative 1.95%.For the upcoming release, Marriott Vacations has a Zacks Rank #3 along with an Earnings ESP +3.94%. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter’s earnings is pegged at $1.27.The company is slated to report second-quarter 2017 results on Aug 3 before the market opens.Finally, we pick Hilton Grand Vacations Inc. (HGV  -  Free Report) — a timeshare company that develops, markets, sells, and manages timeshare resorts. It is a division of Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (HLT  -  Free Report).Last quarter, the company posted a 34.21% positive earnings surprise. It looks poised to beat expectations in the second quarter as well. The company carries a Zacks Rank #3 and has an Earnings ESP of +2.22%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter’s earnings is pegged at 45 cents.Hilton Grand Vacations is expected to report second-quarter results on Aug 2, after market close.Bottom LinePerked up investor confidence is sure to lead to greater demand, thereby boosting hoteliers’ profitability. We thus believe that a sneak peek at some possible outperformers in the hotel space backed by a favorable Zacks Rank, positive earnings ESP and strong fundamentals could be a great idea for investors to gain from this earnings season.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

520,HLT,"Given the improving economic indicators in the U.S., demand for hotels has started to grow. Going forward, though increasing supply growth is expected to limit occupancy levels, overall demand in the U.S. is anticipated to remain solid on the back of firming group travel.Leading hotelier, Hyatt Hotels Corporation (H  -  Free Report) is also undertaking various steps to cash in on this opportunity. Recently, the company unveiled its newest property – Hyatt Regency Lake Washington at Seattle’s Southport – which is the only waterfront hotel within 10 miles of Seattle-Tacoma International Airport.The 347-roomed hotel encompasses 60,000-square-feet of indoor and outdoor event spaces, a spa, and two food and beverage outlets, among other amenities. In fact, this property forms part of over 175 Hyatt Regency locations in more than 30 countries and also marks the brand’s third hotel in Seattle area.Meanwhile, it is to be noted that Hyatt is consistently trying to expand its presence worldwide and capitalize on demand for hotels in international markets, in addition to domestic lands. Expansion in these lucrative markets should help the company gain market share in the hospitality industry, thus boosting its business.The company aims to continue gaining market share globally on its solid brand portfolio, and innovative and exceptional personalized service to guests. Furthermore, its remodeled loyalty program as well as innovative offerings should boost occupancy.In fact, the extension of the Hyatt brand beyond traditional hotel stays, into the swiftly growing wellness space with the Miraval acquisition also bodes well. Going forward, the company aims to build a greater depth of proficiency in wellness and mindfulness that can be extended to the company’s hotel business.However, shares of Hyatt have underperformed the Zacks categorized Hotels & Motels industry in the last six months. While the industry has gained 12.7%, Hyatt has declined 0.4%. Additionally, earnings estimates for current quarter and current year have moved slightly down over the last two months, reflecting anxiety in analysts’ minds.Lingering political uncertainties in key international markets along with currency headwinds remain concerns for Hyatt as well as most of the other hotel chains including Marriott International, Inc. (MAR  -  Free Report), Hilton Worldwide Holdings (HLT  -  Free Report) and Wyndham Worldwide Corporation .Nevertheless, a strong developmental pipeline, consistent expansion plans and a differentiated brand portfolio should continue driving growth for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company.

521,HLT,"Hilton WorldwideHoldings Inc. (HLT  -  Free Report), is known for its scale, size, and commercial platform. Also, the company has fortified its global presence apart from expanding in the domestic market.In line with its expansion strategy, Tapestry Collection by Hilton recently added three hotels to its portfolio. The Troubadour New Orleans hotel was opened in, New Orleans while The Cotton Sail Hotel Savannah and Hotel Ballast Wilmington hotels are slated to open in Georgia and North Carolina, respectively, in 2018.Located in the Central Business District of New Orleans, The Troubadour has 184 guestrooms. Cotton Sail Hotel, with 56 guestrooms, will open in the heart of old Savannah’s National Landmark while the 272-room Hotel Ballast will be located in downtown Wilmington.Launched in January 2017, Tapestry Collection by Hilton has been gaining significant momentum. Further, the addition of the three hotels will not only add to the company’s brand portfolio but will also help it gain traction in key markets.Notably, on Jan 4, Hilton completed the spin-off of Park Hotels & Resorts, Inc. (PK  -  Free Report) and Hilton Grand Vacations Inc. (HGV  -  Free Report) resulting in three independent, publicly-traded companies. On the same day, the company put the previously announced 1-for-3 reverse stock split into effect. All these developments are expected to make Hilton a fee-based, capital efficient and resilient business, with enormous growth potential worldwide.Post the split, the company’s shares have rallied nearly 27.8% to date while the S&P 500 market gained 14.2%. However, macroeconomic fluctuations, unfavorable currency translations and competition from larger hoteliers like Marriott International, Inc. (MAR  -  Free Report) might dent Hilton’s top line.Nonetheless, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company can continue gaining traction with aggressive expansion plans.

522,HLT,"So far, 2017 has been welcoming for the U.S. hotel industry with moderate demand growth supporting increases in both occupancy and average daily rate (ADR). Resultantly, revenue per available room (RevPAR) witnessed a rise of 3.4% and 2.7%, respectively, in the first two quarters.This is further reflected in the industry’s stock-price performance. The Zacks Hotels and Motels Industry has fared better than the broader S&P 500 index over the past six months. While the industry gained 15.8%, the broader index has added only 7.5%.Rising employment, higher real income and increased household net worth has reinforced consumer confidence and sentiment. Thereby, resulting in a steady rise in business and leisure travel and higher transaction volumes, which are likely to continue. This, in turn, is expected to keep the momentum alive.However, peaking supply growth continues to be a meaningful downside risk and is anticipated to put pressure on pricing power, thereby tempering the performance somewhat. Then again, the so-called “Trump Slump” in travel along with macroeconomic concerns in several emerging economies might keep the hotel chain’s growth under check.Nevertheless, consumer and business spending are expected to keep the mood upbeat, suggesting that the U.S. economy will remain on solid footing, going forward. Also, as people are steadfast on spending time with loved ones and keep looking for unique experiences at all price points, hoteliers believe that their diverse portfolio of travel offerings can continue to deliver on that growing demand.  Overall, despite the ongoing economic and political uncertainty, economic fundamentals appear strong enough to support more modest growth in the hotel space in the short-to-medium term without any additional stimulus.Three Stocks to Bet OnGiven this scenario, we zeroed in on three stocks from the Hotels & Motels industry that are well positioned in today’s market environment and could see considerable upside, riding on the positive trends across the industry.The stocks below carry a favorable rank and can prove lucrative additions to your portfolio.Marriott International Inc. (MAR  -  Free Report) became the world's largest hotel company with the acquisition of Starwood. In fact, this buyout is likely to result in a bigger brand with increased scale and a robust development pipeline in the long run. Marriott’s rising North-American business, sizeable international exposure and an attractive brand-position are likely to continue driving growth. Its investments in technology for hotel bookings are also anticipated to improve guest experience, which in turn might boost occupancy.In the last six months, the stock has gained 17.6%. Additionally, Marriott has been seeing an upward trend in earnings estimate revisions. Over the past 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 and 2018 earnings have increased 2.4% and 2.1%, respectively. Also, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company delivered positive earnings surprises in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 9.11%. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, sales are projected to grow 32.9% and 5% on year-over-year basis, in 2017 and 2018, respectively. Meanwhile, earnings are expected to improve 11% in 2017 and 13.1% in 2018.Choice Hotels International, Inc. (CHH  -  Free Report) is one of the largest hotel franchise companies in the world. It has hotels, inns, all-suite hotels and resorts open and under development in countries across the globe under various brands. This Zacks Rank #2 company’s loyalty program, Choice Privileges, is rapidly expanding and continues to drive guest to its franchisees’ hotels.The stock has rallied 18.3% in the last six months. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 earnings inched up 1.4% in the last 60 days and 1.9% for 2018. Also, Choice Hotels pulled off positive earnings surprises in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 3.41%.Per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, sales are projected to grow by 7.8% in 2017 and 5.5% in 2018, on year-over-year basis. Earnings are anticipated to rise 16% and 10.6% in 2017 and 2018, respectively.Leading hospitality company, Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (HLT  -  Free Report) has transformed into a capital-light operating business with the spin-off of a portfolio of hotels and resorts as well as its timeshare business. Hilton’s scale, size, commercial platform and industry-leading brands continue to drive unit growth. Also, this Zacks Rank #2 company’s industry-leading loyalty program continues to boost occupancy.Interestingly, the stock was up 17.5% over the last six months. Upward estimate revisions further add to the optimism. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 and 2018 earnings have moved up 3.8% and 3.2%, respectively, over the last 60 days. Moreover, the company’s earnings surpassed the consensus mark in each of the last four quarters, with an average beat of 19.18%.Zacks’ Best Private Investment IdeasWhile we are happy to share many articles like this on the website, our best recommendations and most in-depth research are not available to the public.Starting today, for the next month, you can follow all Zacks' private buys and sells in real time.

523,HLT,"Hyatt Hotels Corporation (H  -  Free Report) has large-scale expansion and development plans in Asia-Pacific, Europe, Africa, Middle East and Latin America to gain further traction in the hospitality industry.Hyatt affiliate, Andaz recently announced the opening of Andaz Singapore, which marks the first Andaz hotel in Southeast Asia and the brand’s 17th opening.Offering 342 contemporary guestrooms, including 26 suites, Andaz Singapore is located in close proximity to the Changi Airport and Central Business District.Notably, Singapore’s tourism industry has seen solid growth in first-quarter 2017. According to the Singapore Tourism Board (STB), a leading economic development agency in tourism and one of the country’s key service sectors, Tourism Receipts (TR) grew 15% to $6.4 billion in the quarter.Moreover, for 2017, STB expects TR in the range of $25.1-$25.8 billion, reflecting 1% to 4% growth from last year. Thus, Singapore offers Hyatt a lot of scope for expansion.However, the company will face tough competition from hotel chains like Marriott International, Inc. (MAR  -  Free Report), Wyndham Worldwide Corporation  and Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc. (HLT  -  Free Report) that are looking to tap into such markets. Lingering political uncertainties in some key operating regions and currency headwinds might also impede revenue growth.Nevertheless, the company is poised to grow on a strong developmental pipeline along with consistent brand establishment and expansion strategies.Notably, year to date, shares of Hyatt have recorded a gain of 26.6%, outperforming its industry’s 17.1%. Currently, Hyatt carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

524,HLT,"Marriott International, Inc. (MAR  -  Free Report) has entered into a partnership with Samsung  and Legrand to introduce IoT rooms, which is expected to enhance guest experience.Powered by Marriott's Innovation Lab at its corporate headquarters, The IoT Guestroom Lab looks for concepts to revolutionize guest experience. The features range from intuitive lighting, voice-activated room controls to virtual assistants. They also offer more efficient designs and construction.The lab provides many responsive IoT systems, devices and applications that enrich communication and optimize hotel operations. With this partnership, Marriott aims to leverage mobile and voice-enabled technology to better serve guests.  It is to be noted that in today’s world of price comparison and shared economy, hotels are pushing their boundaries via digital innovation to retain customers. Basic functionalities such as hotel check-ins, shopping and booking capability through smart apps are becoming the norm. Thus, hoteliers will now have to leverage the power of mobile phones to take on-property experience to the next level. A confluence of technologies, including faster processing power, cloud computing and IoT, is thus set to enhance the mobile channel.Introduction of this smart technology is therefore in line with Marriott’s relentless effort to enhance guest experience across 30 of the company’s brands.Also, Marriott is working toward a future where hotel owners will have a seamless, end-to-end solution with minimal equipment, and customers will enjoy unified experience by accessing their own data and information, as well as accessible voice and mobile-optimized controls. Such systems are expected to improve hotel operations and strengthen personalized service to guests.Notably, Marriott, Samsung and Legrand will be analyzing feedback to the room over the next three months to continue innovation via IoT. Customers are expected to start enjoying the benefits of this technology over the next five years.We believe Marriott’s focus on a re-imagined technology strategy and differentiated offerings to provide unmatched travel experiences will continue to draw guests.Zacks Rank and Other Stocks to ConsiderMarriott carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

525,HLT,"On Nov 10, we initiated a coverage on Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (HLT  -  Free Report).The company exhibits solid long-term growth potential given various sales-building initiatives which can help counter near-term macro headwinds.Capital-Light Business ModelIn January 2017, Hilton completed the spin-off of Park Hotels & Resorts, Inc. (PK  -  Free Report) and Hilton Grand Vacations Inc. (HGV  -  Free Report), resulting in three independent, publicly traded companies. On the same day, the company put the previously announced 1-for-3 reverse stock split into effect. All these developments are expected to make Hilton a fee-based, capital efficient and resilient business, with enormous growth potential worldwide.Post the split on Jan 4, the company’s shares have rallied nearly 25.2% while the S&P 500 market gained 14.2%. In fact, the focus is expected to be on driving market share, units, free cash flow as well as maintain the company’s strong balance sheet and accelerating return of capital. Further, as Hilton’s unit growth is mostly financed by third parties, the company is capable of generating substantial returns on minimal capital investment.This asset-light model is expected to help shareholders receive high returns on invested capital. In fact, Hilton expects to return between $1 billion and $1.1 billion to shareholders through buybacks and dividends in 2017. This, in turn, reinstates our faith in the company’s strong fundamentals and cash flow position.Strong Loyalty ProgramHilton has created one of the largest loyalty programs, Hilton Honors. With about 70 million members, this program is an extremely valuable asset for the company. In fact, about 57% of all occupancy per night takes place through this program.Additionally, Hilton recently announced a partnership with American Express (Amex) in a bid to drive demand. Starting November, Amex launched and will be marketing a portfolio of Hilton Honors credit cards in the United States, which will help drive the program’s membership and enhance member engagement. The growth of card under this partnership should result inlicense fee growth for Hilton.Expansion StrategiesApart from expanding its presence in the domestic market, Hilton has fortified its global presence. The company’s scale, size, commercial platform and industry-leading brands continue to drive unit growth.In 2016, Hilton increased its system size by 6.6%, maintaining its position as the fastest growing global hospitality company on an organic basis.For 2017, the company projects 6.5% net unit growth. It has more rooms under construction in Europe, the Middle East and Asia Pacific than any other hotel chain.Notably, the company continues to make great progress with its luxury development strategy, anticipating double-digit growth over the next few years. Hilton’s new brands including Home2 Suites, Tru by Hilton, Tapestry Collection are also gaining momentum globally.Potential Headwinds to the Top LineIn the United States, RevPAR growth is being impeded by softer group performance and weakness in the oil and gas markets despite strong demand. In fact, the company continues to forecast U.S. RevPAR growth at the low end of its 1-3% system-wide range.Hilton’s considerable international presence also makes it vulnerable to the economic conditions in various regions. In the Middle East, political unrest and lower government spending continue to hurt tourism. Also, a cooling Chinese economy might hurt discretionary spending as well as travel. In addition, significant currency headwinds may continue to hurt results in the near-term.Nevertheless, we are reasonably optimistic on this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company’s prospects, given its aggressive expansions strategies, asset-light model and industry-leading guest program.Another stock worth considering in the same industry is Choice Hotels International, Inc. (CHH  -  Free Report), with the same Zacks Rank as Hilton. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Choice Hotels has witnessed its Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year’s earnings revising upward by 1.4% over the last two months.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

Per the latest Earnings Preview, 82.8% surpassed earnings estimates while 67.8% beat revenue estimates and 62.1% outpaced both the counts. Further, total earnings of these companies increased 25% from the same period last year on 10.7% higher revenues.The report projects an 18.3% year-over-year rise in total earnings for S&P 500 companies, with revenues likely to increase 7.7%. This compares favorably with the year-over-year increase of 13.4% for earnings in the fourth quarter but unfavorably with 8.6% year-over-year revenue growth in the last reported quarter.Consumer Discretionary Sector on Growth TrajectoryLike some other sectors, the widely diversified Consumer Discretionary sector is likely to put up a stellar show in Q1 earnings.Currently, the domestic economy is favorable for the consumer discretionary sector on increased demand for goods and services. According to the Fed’s latest forecast, the economy will grow at a reasonable rate of 2.7% in 2018. Unemployment is predicted at 3.8% for 2018. Moreover, high real disposable income and low inflation are resulting in improved purchasing behavior. The fourth quarter of 2017 saw the highest consumer spending in three years.Total earnings for the sector are expected to increase 7.2% in the first quarter, up from 0.8% in the last reported quarter. Revenues are projected to grow 6.8%, higher than 4.6% growth recorded in the preceding quarter. Even though margins are not  expected to grow for the sector in the first quarter, it compares favorably with 0.4% decline in the fourth quarter of 2017.Promising Gaming Industry Scenario The Zacks Gaming industry, under Consumer Discretionary, has performed well in the past year. The industry gained 24.1%, outpacing the S&P 500’s rally of 12.2%. We expect the industry to have grown in the first quarter on increasing demand for gaming services and rapid expansion of these service providers. Also, according to Research and Markets, the global casino gaming market is anticipated to witness a CAGR of 10.16% in the 2017-2021 period.Within this growing market, Boyd Gaming Corporation (BYD  -  Free Report) is the distinguished owner and operator of 22 gaming entertainment properties. The company is scheduled to report quarterly numbers on Apr 26, after market close. Over the past year, the company has gained 50.7% outperforming the industry.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter earnings is pegged at 34 cents, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 6.3%.

The company’s shares grew 21.1% in the past year, lagging the industry.MGM Resorts’ top line in the first quarter is expected to be driven by strong business model, extensive non-gaming revenue opportunities, high-quality assets and attractive property locations. Further, maximization of digital technology is likely to boost the company’s performance. (Read More: MGM Resorts Q1 Earnings: Macau Operations Hold Key).The consensus estimate pegs first-quarter earnings at 31 cents, reflecting a decline of 18.4% year over year.

However, with the recent Toys “R” Us liquidation, we expect the industry to grow at a much slower pace for quite some time.First-quarter results for the famous toymaker Mattel, Inc. (MAT  -  Free Report) will be affected, as a considerable portion of its revenues were generated from sales to Toys ""R"" Us. (Read More: Factors Setting the Tone for Mattel's Q1 Earnings). The company is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 numbers on Apr 26, after market close. Its shares have lost 37.1% in the past year, reflecting its sluggish performance.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at a loss of 37 cents, wider than a loss of 32 cents in the year-ago quarter.

Moreover, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of nearly $690.9 million, down 6.1% from the prior-year quarter.Mattel holds a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) and has an Earnings ESP of +0.64%, a combination that does not show a beat.U.S. Hotels Seem ComfortingThere are ample reasons why the U.S. hotel industry should continue to gain on both the top and bottom line. A strong economy, higher income and increased consumer confidence have driven demand for both leisure and business travel. The supply-demand environment in the United States has been favorable since 2010, with growth in demand outpacing supply growth. PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) expects demand (2.1% rise) to outpace supply (increase of 1.9%) in 2018. Moreover, per a report by Deloitte, the hotel industry is expected to sustain strong 5-6% growth throughout 2018.The Zacks Hotels and Motels industry has rallied 30.1% in the past year, outperforming the S&P 500.Hotel bigwig Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc.

This exceeds the company’s expected earnings in the range of 43-47 cents per share for the quarter to be reported.Hilton carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and an Earnings ESP of +3.09%, a combination that increases the odds of a beat. Also, the company has gained grew 40.2% in the past year.Another major hotelier Extended Stay America, Inc. (STAY  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 26, after market close.

527,HLT,"On Sep 26, we issued an updated research report on hospitality company, Wyndham Worldwide Corporation .Spin-Off of Hotel Group is a PositiveOn Aug 3, 2017, Wyndham announced its plan to spin off the company's hotel business – Wyndham Hotel Group – resulting in two separate publicly traded companies. The transaction is expected to be completed in the first half of 2018.Notably, the company believes that the spin-off of its Hotel Group business and the combination of Vacation Ownership segment with RCI is the best structure to unlock shareholder value and enable strong long-term growth across the businesses.In fact, this transaction is anticipated to increase the fit, focus, and strategic flexibility of the post spin-off companies, facilitate prospective capital raising and position them to better respond to developments in their respective markets.Prospects for its Other Two SegmentsWyndham derives a substantial chunk of revenues from its vacation ownership business – Wyndham Vacation Ownership (WVO) – which is one of the fastest evolving and profitable sectors in the hospitality industry.Presently, increasing the number of new owners is Wyndham’s most important strategic initiative at WVO. Along these lines the company is making great progress as WVO brought 10% more owners into the system in 2016 and is looking to increase new owner base by 23% in 2017.After the stipulated spin-off, WVO will become the world's largest publicly traded timeshare business with a portfolio of over 220 resorts, a strong sales and marketing platform and over $2 billion in gross timeshare sales. The company will also include RCI – the world's largest timeshare exchange company – along with its U.S. Vacation Rental brands.Meanwhile, Wyndham’s Destination Network business continues to see strong growth from its Vacation Rental brands with healthy increases in organic unit count, occupancy and price. In fact, the company’s performance has been particularly strong in Europe, where the company has been investing heavily in recruiting, services and improving guest experience to drive long-term growth.Wyndham’s strong loyalty program – Wyndham Rewards – offers great prospects as well. Currently, there are about 52 million members in Wyndham Rewards, an increase of 10% over prior year. Markedly, Wyndham Rewards members stay 12% longer than nonmembers and generate 64% more in revenue to Wyndham’s franchisees.The company has also formed an alliance with Caesars Entertainment, which will unite two of the world’s leading hotel and casino loyalty programs.Thus, going forward, the company’s diversified product portfolio, strong loyalty program and effective marketing efforts are expected to sustain its growth momentum.ConcernsBringing in new owners as part of WVO expansion strategy is proving to be costly and taking more effort as reflected in the company’s decreasing Volume per Guest. Owner tour flow is also getting dampened by the company’s focus on new owners as well as more targeted marketing efforts. Thus, as Wyndham starts to focus more on increasing number of owners, short-term effects on revenues and EBITDA may not be favorable.Meanwhile, a sluggish economy in Brazil, uncertainty in Africa, and macroeconomic headwinds in Venezuela and soft demand from oil-producing regions such as Texas may keep revenues under pressure. Wyndham also has a significant number of vacation rental properties in Europe, where the economic/political conditions are expected to be challenging post Brexit.Additionally, major currency headwinds are affecting most of the hoteliers including Hyatt Hotels Corporation (H  -  Free Report), Hilton Worldwide Holdings (HLT  -  Free Report), Marriott International, Inc. (MAR  -  Free Report), among others. This, in turn, might restrict Wyndham’s revenue growth.4 Stocks to Watch after the Massive Equifax HackCybersecurity stocks spiked on recent news of a data breach affecting 143 million Americans.

528,HLT,"Tru by Hilton — a new midscale innovative brand belonging to Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (HLT  -  Free Report) — recently announced plans of opening a 106-room hotel in Morrisville, NC. In collaboration with Parks Hospitality Group, the new hotel will be located in the Raleigh area at 350 Airgate Drive, in close proximity to the Raleigh-Durham Airport.Slated to be the brand’s first hotel in the state of North Carolina, Tru by Hilton Raleigh Durham Airport will provide guests with a range of amenities including a fitness center, food and beverage options and advanced technological facilities. The property will also participate in the guest loyalty program — Hilton Honors loyalty program — that serves a number of members worldwide.Tru by Hilton, with its relentless expansion effort has reached a rapid growing developmental pipeline within the hospitality industry. In fact, apart from the running four hotels, the company expects to open 10 hotels by the end of 2017. Additionally, 50 more hotels are slated for launch in 2018.Notably, Hilton’s scale, size, commercial platform and industry-leading brands continue to drive unit growth, taking a disproportionate share of the global hotel development activity.In January, Hilton completed the spin-offs of Park Hotels & Resorts, Inc. (PK  -  Free Report) and Hilton Grand Vacations Inc. (HGV  -  Free Report) resulting in three independent, publicly traded companies. On the same day, the company put the previously announced 1-for-3 reverse stock split into effect. All these developments are expected to make Hilton a fee-based, capital efficient and resilient business, with enormous growth potential worldwide.Post the split on Jan 4, the company’s shares have rallied nearly 18.4% while the S&P 500 market gained 10%.However, macroeconomic fluctuations, unfavorable currency translations and competition from larger hoteliers like Marriott International, Inc. (MAR  -  Free Report) might dent Hilton’s top line. This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company can counter the slump with aggressive expansion plans.

530,HLT,"Founded in 2008 by Brian Chesky, Joe Gebbia, and Nathan Blecharczyk, Airbnb is an app and website that connects people seeking lodging with renters who have listed their personal houses, apartments, guest rooms, etc., on either platform. Travelers can book accommodations around the world online or from a tablet or mobile phone.Airbnb is an easy way for people to monetize any extra living space they have. With over 3 million listings worldwide—including 1,400 castles—it operates in over 65,000 cities and 191 countries, the company has a total guest list of more than 150 million people.Airbnb as a LifestyleBack in 2014, Airbnb announced a huge, company-wide rebranding, indicating a desire to transition from a hotel service to a lifestyle brand. Since its inception, it has been easy to categorize the company as just another hotel option, taking on big industry names like Wyndham , Hyatt (H  -  Free Report), Hilton Worldwide (HLT  -  Free Report), and InterContinental Hotels (IHG  -  Free Report).But its brand upheaval demonstrates how Airbnb has the potential to be something much more. In a blog post, the company stated they want to possess a logo that will be seen on a variety of products, houses, and businesses, to make sure people understand that whoever owns it is a supporter of their ideal—but, more importantly, a supporter of their brand.Dubbed Bélo, its logo is a symbol of belonging. While it may look like a misshapen paperclip, Bélo is a “symbol for people who want to welcome into their home new experiences, new cultures, and new conversations.” Airbnb has also redesigned its website and app, which are now far cleaner than previous versions, and feature subtle animations and flashier imagery.Controversies to ConsiderAirbnb may present a legitimate challenge to the hotel industry, but the company is enveloped by controversy and regulatory issues in cities that are none too pleased with residents turning their homes into hotels, reflecting similar problems that plague companies like Uber.In San Francisco, critics have blamed Airbnb for the growing vacancy rates and the over $3,900 average monthly rent. Average home prices in the city recently hit the $1.1 million median mark, and San Francisco’s population has reached an all-time high, according to Paragon Real Estate Group.Despite the absence of a permit, which, according to law, one must have in order to rent for under 30 days, San Francisco residents are still illegally listing personal homes and apartments for less than the required number of days on Airbnb. And, legislation was approved in San Francisco last June that would require anyone listing available property on Airbnb or other sites to register the property with the city, most likely hindering a person’s ability to casually list a spare room for some extra cash going forwardThe company is also embroiled in a long-standing battle with New York City, where they face similar issues as in San Francisco. Last fall, the New York State Senate passed a bill that makes online apartment listings for stays shorter than 30 days illegal, which, not surprisingly, thwarts Airbnb in their goal to expand its market.Shortly after, Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed that bill into law, with politicians, local hoteliers, and affordable housing advocates hailing the decision as a victory. Some have calculated that the law has deleted roughly half of Airbnb listings in New York. “To avoid fees, hosts in large apartment buildings can only rent rooms or beds in their houses, not their entire apartment,” notes Travel + Leisure, while hosts who rent entire homes or row houses will not be affected.But Airbnb’s biggest challenge may have been dealing with the #AirbnbWhileBlack controversy, which was a recent protest movement against multiple instances of the company’s hosts apparently declining guests due to skin color. Airbnb admitted that a problem exists, and at the time, said it was trying to tackle the problem by educating hosts and guests, and by responding to concerns they raise.Commenting at the 2016 Fortune Brainstorm Tech conference, CEO Chesky said that “We were so focused on creating trust and safety that we took our eye off the ball on this other important issue,” Chesky said. “There were lots of things we didn’t think about when we, as three white guys, designed the platform.”IPO BuzzSince 2014, and regardless of its fight with certain cities, rumors have been swirling of Airbnb’s inevitable initial public offering, even though CEO Chesky said no to an IPO at that time. In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, Chesky said that “we will do it at a time when it benefits the company, when we have a good reason.”Airbnb’s last valuation clocked in at $31 billion—it’s worth only about $15 billion less than Marriot (MAR  -  Free Report)—thanks to its latest billion-dollar round of equity funding, making it the second most valuable U.S. startup behind Uber. This, as well as being a recognized name in the hotel industry and sharing economy, is helping raise buzz. Their popularity among venture capitalists (VCs) is helping increase hype, too.However, this new round of funding, in addition to a separate deal where investors are planning to buy $200 million in stock from Airbnb employees, could be seen as a move to relieve some of the pressure of filing for an IPO. Airbnb is adding significantly to its amount of available cash, allowing it to spend enough and continue its global expansion without going public.Airbnb is also reportedly watching fellow tech unicorn Spotify, and what IPO route the music streaming giant will take. According to The Wall Street Journal, Airbnb may want to mimic Spotify’s unconventional plans; Spotify is planning to list its shares directly on the New York Stock Exchange without raising a new round of funding (also read: Spotify is Likely Going Public Without an IPO: Will Other Tech Unicorns Follow?)This move benefits private companies who don’t need cash, “but want a way for employees, founders, and other shareholders to start trading their shares,” notes Business Insider.How Might an Airbnb IPO Perform?Thanks to Snap Inc.’s (SNAP  -  Free Report) very successful IPO last March, the spotlight is shining with renewed intensity on startups like Airbnb, and investors are wondering if the online hospitality marketplace will file for an IPO this year.Like other tech companies, Airbnb is a company for the digital age, and many are wanting to be the first ones to invest in its expected success. Billions of dollars have been invested in the digital sharing economy over the past few years—specifically, in companies whose platforms are apps and websites that connect a person selling an item or service with a consumer who wants to use that item or service.Particularly, Airbnb is popular because it is inexpensive to run; it doesn’t have to build or maintain hotels or hotel staff. The company is also easy to grow quickly, as there is no need for a physical office in every country, just consumers with a smartphone.Like any tech startup, Airbnb’s IPO will be a toss-up. Its valuation is impressive in and of itself, and will most likely be the driving factor for investors come time for a public entrance into the market. Airbnb needs to keep an eye on their increasing competition. Companies like Roomorama, Homeaway, and the Expedia (EXPE)-owned Housetrip all have a dedicated following of their own, and are all beginning to eat into the market share.Despite rival companies and regulatory issues, Airbnb has the potential to be one of the hottest upcoming IPOs. With billions of dollars in investments already, a thriving rebranding, and its rising popularity among travelers, Airbnb’s IPO is one to watch out for.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time. It’s a once-in-a-generation opportunity to invest in pure genius. Click for details >>

531,HLT,"A Marriott International, Inc. (MAR  -  Free Report) brand, Marriott Marquis, recently announced the opening of its hotel in Chicago, IL.In fact, Marriott Marquis Chicago is the brand’s first property in the city and also the largest Marriott hotel to open in North America in 2017.The 1205-roomed hotel is suitably located in the burgeoning entertainment and convention district of McCormick Square. Also, the property encompasses a huge event space, several meeting rooms, a Club Lounge, a fitness facility as well as food and beverage offerings.Notably, in addition to domestic markets, Marriott is consistently trying to expand its presence worldwide and capitalize on the demand for hotels in international markets. Going forward, the company also plans to significantly grow its global portfolio of luxury and lifestyle brands.

Post-acquisition, shares of the company have surged 53.5% while the S&P 500 index gained 14.7%, depicting the positive effect of the buyout.Moreover, given strong transient demand along with improvements in business and leisure travel, we believe Marriott is poised to grow in the near as well as long term. Investments in technology for hotel bookings are likely to improve guest experience too, thus boosting occupancy.Meanwhile, Marriott believes that linking of the three industry-leading guest loyalty programs — Marriott Rewards, Ritz-Carlton Rewards and Starwood Preferred Guest — would lead to an even larger loyalty community in the long run.Yet, lingering political uncertainties in key international markets along with currency headwinds remain concerns for the company as well as the other hotel chains like Hyatt Hotels Corporation (H  -  Free Report), Hilton Worldwide Holdings (HLT  -  Free Report) and Wyndham Worldwide Corporation .Nevertheless, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s continual expansion efforts and an unmatched portfolio of lodging brands raise investors’ optimism in the stock.

532,HLT,"On Sep 8, we issued an updated research report on Marriott International, Inc. (MAR  -  Free Report).Though the company has solid long-term growth potential but the risks from near-term headwinds might somewhat restrict its growth momentum.Acquisitions to Boost GrowthMarriott continues to rely on acquisitions in order to expand its footprint. After announcing the acquisition of Starwood Hotels & Resorts on Sep 23, 2016, Marriott has become the world’s largest hotel company, spanning across 125 countries with more than 6,200 properties.Post-acquisition, shares of the company have rallied 48.7% since the date while the broader S&P 500 index has gained 13.4% in the same time frame.Moreover, Marriott's distribution has more than doubled in Asia and the Middle East & Africa combined with the purchase of Starwood. Also, the company believes that the deal will be accretive to cash flow and earnings by the second year following closure and result in annual cost savings of at least $250 million on the back of lower operating, and general & administrative expenses.Also, Marriott became the largest hotel company in Africa with the Protea Hospitality Group buyout in 2014. This was followed by the acquisition of Delta Hotels and Resorts brand in 2015.Interestingly, even with 30 brands under portfolio, the company has not ruled out further mergers and acquisitions activities. Holding about 14%–15% market share in the United States alone, Marriott is well-positioned to capitalize on the existing growth potential.Solid Expansion PlansMarriott’s extensive portfolio and a strong brand position allow it to charge a premium room rate in the highly competitive lodging industry. Given its property locations, we believe that the company is well poised to benefit from the increasing market demand backed by stepped up business as well as leisure traveling.Notably, in addition to domestic markets, Marriott is consistently trying to expand its presence worldwide and capitalize on the demand for hotels in the international markets. Going forward, the company plans to significantly grow its global portfolio of luxury and lifestyle brands. In fact, it anticipates net room additions of 6% in 2017.Outside the United States, the hotel company is trying to expand its footprint, especially in Asia, Latin America, Middle East and Africa. Meanwhile, Marriott’s European pipeline has grown consistently in the recent past and is expected to continue, going forward.Further, it is to be noted that China is the largest source market for outbound travel now, with 700 million trips projected over the next five years. Thus, the company aims to broaden its offerings of guest amenities and services appealing to Chinese travelers in more hotels. In this regard, Marriott expects its new joint venture with Alibaba to aid in capturing a greater share of this growing Chinese travel market, thereby growing membership of its loyalty programs and reducing distribution costs.All in all, we expect the company’s continuous expansion plans to add immensely to the top line and boost its overall performance as well.Other ProspectsDigital innovations and social media are starting to play an increasingly important role in hotel bookings. Marriott too has rolled out guestVoice to measure guest feedback, introduced SPG Mobile check-in and check-out in North America, and achieved procurement and OTA cost savings.Additionally, post its Starwood acquisition, the company has linked industry-leading guest loyalty programs — Marriott Rewards, Ritz-Carlton Rewards and Starwood Preferred Guest — and announced the matching of member status between the programs, thus leading to an even larger loyalty community.These investments in technology for hotel bookings are likely to improve guest experience and thus boost occupancy in the long run.Most importantly, frequent share buybacks and continuous increase in quarterly dividend payments affirm the company’s optimistic outlook and growth prospects.Potential Headwinds to the Top LineDespite immense growth potential, a sluggish economy in Brazil is weighing on demand in the Latin American region. In the Middle East, political unrest and low oil prices also continue to hurt tourism.Meanwhile, in the domestic market, the company is facing increased competition in New York due to oversupply of hotels. Furthermore, soft demand in the oil producing regions is expected to continue hurting RevPAR (Revenue per Available Room).Also in Europe, economic/political conditions are expected to remain challenging post-Brexit. Given Marriott’s considerable presence therein, this might limit its business growth. Additionally, soft economic conditions in France and terror threats in some major locations are expected to hurt revenues of the company.Marriott’s considerable international presence also makes it highly vulnerable to fluctuations in exchange rates. In addition, significant currency headwinds are affecting most hotel companies across the world, including Hyatt Hotels Corp. (H  -  Free Report), Hilton Worldwide Holdings (HLT  -  Free Report), Wyndham Worldwide Corp. , etc. This volatility is expected to prevail in the near term.Currently, Marriott carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

533,HLT,"The improving economy in the United States has been favoring hospitality companies. In the next 10 years, global travel is estimated to increase at a compound rate of 7%. International trips are expected to reach 1.8 billion by 2030, which reflects growing demand for hotels.Leading hoteliers like Marriott International, Inc. (MAR  -  Free Report) and Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (HLT  -  Free Report) are striving to rake in profits from the competitive industry.Marriott and Hilton have a distinguished footprint across the globe along with a strong domestic presence. Marriott and its brands own more than 6,400 properties worldwide. Hilton currently has a portfolio of 14 world-class brands, comprising more than 5,100 properties with nearly 838,000 rooms in 103 countries and territories.The companies are focusing on the expansion of their global foothold and capitalize on the demand for hotels in the international markets.Let’s find out which stock is a better pick.Price PerformanceMarriot has had an impressive run on the bourse year to date, compared with Hilton. While Marriott has returned 61.2% year to date outperforming its industry’s26.4% rally, Hilton has lost 2.7%.Estimated Earnings & RevenuesArguably, earnings growth is of utmost importance for determining a stock’s potential as surging profit levels indicate strong prospects (and stock price gains).For the current year, Marriott’s earnings per share are expected to grow nearly 11%. Moreover, year-over-year sales growth for the current year is expected at 32.9%. However, Hilton’s current-year earnings and sales are anticipated to decline 29% and 22.1%, respectively. This provides Marriott an edge over Hilton.ValuationThe P/E ratio is considered for the evaluation of a stock. Typically, stocks with high P/E are overvalued, whereas those with low P/E are undervalued. However, this metric disregards the company's growth rate. Hence, an investor is likely to pick stocks which are trading at substantially lower PE multiples.Since we are considering two companies with different growth trajectories, price/earnings to growth (PEG) ratio will provide better valuation. The PEG ratio takes into account the companies’ individual growth paths.Although the companies’ PEG ratios indicate a stretched valuation compared with the industry, Marriot is in a favorable position. While the industry’s PEG ratio is 11.3, Marriott and Hilton have a PEG of 3.4x and 8.3x, respectively.Return on EquityMarriott delivered a return on equity (ROE) of 31.6% in the trailing 12 months compared with the industry’s gain of 6.2%. Hilton’s ROE is pegged at 27.3%. This indicates that Marriott reinvests more efficiently than its peers.Net MarginTraditionally, gross margin for hospitality companies is comparatively higher as majority of the expenses come from cost of operations. However, the sector’s profits are not very high which is evident from net profit margin or net margin. The industry’s trailing 12-month net margin is 4.6, while that for Marriott and Hilton are 6.3% and 0.3%, respectively.Clearly, Marriott’s cost savings have led to better margins whereas Hilton lags in terms of margin expansion.Final ThoughtsOur comparative analysis shows that Marriott has an edge over Hilton in terms of price movement, higher projected EPS growth, valuation, ROE and margins.Zacks Rank & Other PicksMarriott and Hilton carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Two top-ranked stocks in the Consumer Discretionary sector include Choice Hotels International, Inc. (CHH  -  Free Report) and Clarus Corporation (CLAR  -  Free Report). While Clarus sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Choice Hotels carries a Zacks Rank #2.

538,HLT,"Hurricane Irma has grown into a massive Category 5 storm that is now surging through the Caribbean towards Florida. Irma’s looming threat to the large tropical island area has already triggered evacuation measures and other hurricane-based precautions. The hurricane also helped to sink stocks with strong ties to the Caribbean tourism industry on Tuesday.Irma UpdateThe National Hurricane Center recently updated its assessment of Hurricane Irma and outlined details of the tropical storm’s likely path though the Caribbean.“Irma is a potentially catastrophic category 5 hurricane and will bring life-threatening wind, storm surge, and rainfall hazards to portions of the northeastern Leeward Islands beginning later today and the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico beginning tomorrow,” the NHC said in a statement on Tuesday.The center also issued hurricane watches for a portion of the Dominican Republic, Haiti, the southeastern Bahamas, and Turks and Caicos. Irma is set to hit these areas by Thursday and Friday.The new report also suggests that the rest of the Bahamas, Cuba, Florida, and the Keys are on watch for later this week.New #hurricane watches have been issued for the Turks & Caicos Islands, SE Bahamas & the north coast of #Haiti https://t.co/tW4KeGdBFb #Irma pic.twitter.com/uJmnbDnlY3— NHC Atlantic Ops (@NHC_Atlantic) September 5, 2017“However, it is too soon to specify the timing and magnitude of the impacts,” the NHC noted. “Elsewhere, it is too early to determine what direct impact Irma might have on the continental United States.”Irma is currently belting out 180 miles winds east of Antigua with a Northwestern trajectory. The storm is expected to remain a strong Category 4 or 5 hurricane in the coming days. Florida Governor Rick Scott declared a state of emergency for the entire state yesterday. He also called for all 7,000 National Guard members in the state to report for duty this Friday.The new Irma report prompted Governor Scott to continue his now-constant tropical storm watch and preparation updates to Florida residents on Twitter (TWTR  -  Free Report).#HurricaneIrma is now a Category 5.

539,HLT,"Hyatt Hotels Corporation (H  -  Free Report), the widely recognized global hospitality company, recently announced the official inception of Hyatt Regency Shanghai Global Harbor in Shanghai’s Putuo District. This is the seventh hotel in Shanghai under the Hyatt brand.Notably, this property is included in the list of 175 Hyatt Regency locations in more than 30 countries and also marks the brand’s third hotel in Shanghai.Hyatt Regency Shanghai Global Harbor is suitably located near the Zhongshan Park Commercial Area and the Jing’an Temple Commercial Zone, with a direct access to Metro Lines 3, 4 and 13. It is also in close proximity to The National Convention and Exhibition Center (Shanghai), Hongqiao Railway Station and Hongqiao.The 318-roomed hotel, including 26 suites, encompasses four destination restaurant and lounges along with dynamic indoor and outdoor event and meeting venues, among other amenities. These facilities are expected to cater to the needs of both business and leisure travelers.It is to be noted that Hyatt stands out for its strong global expansion strategies. In addition to domestic lands, Hyatt is consistently trying to expand its presence in the Asia-Pacific, Europe, Africa, Middle East and Latin America regions. Expansion in these lucrative markets should help the company gain traction in the hospitality industry.Interestingly, the company has experienced net room growth between 6% and 7% over nine consecutive quarters. With roughly 60 hotel additions expected, 2017 is set be another year of record openings.Moreover, the company aims to continue gaining market share globally on its solid brand portfolio, and innovative and exceptional personalized service to guests.

540,HLT,"On Aug 25, we issued an updated research report on Hyatt Hotels Corporation (H  -  Free Report).The company’s strong differentiated brand portfolio and offering of innovative and exceptional personalized service have helped it gain traction globally through both its managed and franchised hotels. As of Jun 30, 2017, the company's portfolio included 731 properties in 56 countries, operating under 13 premier brands.Meanwhile, shares of Hyatt have outperformed the industry year to date. The shares of the company increased 4.6% as compared with the industry’s gain of 1.2%.Additionally, the company’s earnings estimates have moved north in the current year, reflecting analyst optimism. Over the past month, current and next earnings estimates have gone up 10.2% and 6%, respectively. Moreover, Hyatt’s reported earnings have beaten the consensus estimate in the four trailing quarters with an average surprise of 85.36%.Key Growth DriversThe company’s strong developmental pipeline, consistent expansion plans, extensive international exposure and efforts to grow the Hyatt brand beyond traditional hotel stays are major growth drivers.Notably, in addition to domestic lands, Hyatt is consistently trying to expand its presence in the Asia-Pacific, Europe, Africa, Middle East and Latin America regions. Expansion in these lucrative markets should help the company gain traction in the hospitality industry.Interestingly, the company has experienced net room growth between 6% and 7% over nine consecutive quarters. With roughly 60 hotel additions expected, 2017 is set be another year of record openings.Also, the company continues to rapidly expand the Hyatt Place and Hyatt House brands globally, reflecting its robust momentum in the fast-growing select service category.Meanwhile, the acquisition of Miraval in January 2017 has extended Hyatt’s brand beyond traditional hotel stays into a swiftly growing space, namely, wellness, which goes well with high-end travelers. Though Miraval’s operations are likely to contribute meaningfully to Hyatt's overall earnings starting 2019, the initial response has been positive as well.Taking a cue from the Miraval acquisition, the company is increasingly focusing on private accommodations, another fast-growing travel segment. Hyatt believes that this category has the potential to add meaningfully to growth over time.Hyatt also intends to continue exploring new avenues apart from traditional hotel in order to evolve with changing tastes and preferences of guests.Meanwhile, the company is continuously devising newer plans to enhance guest experience and raise occupancy in order to survive in a tough economic environment.  In first-quarter 2017, Hyatt launched a loyalty program World of Hyatt — a platform for guest engagement. The company expects the program to attract customers and aid in sustaining its market share gains.ChallengesMacroeconomic concerns in several international markets might spell trouble for the company. In the Middle East, political unrest, lower government spending, new hotels and a tough oil market continue to hurt tourism. Additionally, the slowdown in the Chinese economy might continue to dent discretionary spending as well as travel.Meanwhile, in Europe, economic/political conditions are expected to be challenging after the U.K.’s exit from the 28-member economic bloc. Recent terror assaults in key European cities have also affected tourism. We note that this might limit Hyatt’s business growth, given its considerable presence in Europe.Given its significant international presence, Hyatt remains highly vulnerable to fluctuations in exchange rates, like other hotel companies including Marriott International, Inc. (MAR  -  Free Report), Hilton Worldwide Holdings (HLT  -  Free Report) and Wyndham Worldwide Corporation . In fact, the company has been witnessing a decline in international inbound travel owing to a stronger dollar.Hyatt currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

541,HLT,"Hyatt Hotels Corporation (H  -  Free Report) recently announced that its board of directors has raised its share repurchase authorization. In the same press release, the company discussed the sale of Hyatt Regency Monterey Hotel and Spa and, Avendra LLC.Enhancing Shareholder Value Doesn’t Indicate Lower Investment Opportunities  Hyatt’s board has approved the repurchase of up to an additional $750 million shares. Including the latest authorization, the company has approximately $864 million shares left to be repurchased under its existing repurchase authorization. It repurchased shares worth $700 million between Jan 1 and Nov 15, 2017.However, the company is not rewarding shareholders at the expense of business expansion. It has a solid cash position to explore profitable avenues too. The company continues to focus on investing in brand and sales building.In fact, recently Hyatt opened its first joint development hotel in Japan and is also set to double its Africa footprint by 2020.Asset Sale Improves Cash Position On Nov 9, Hyatt sold its 550-rommed Hyatt Regency Monterey Hotel and Spa for approximately $60 million. This resulted in a pre-tax gain of approximately $17 million. Notably, this property sale was one of the six asset sales planned by the company. Also, it will remain under a long-term franchise agreement within the Hyatt system.Hyatt also received net cash proceeds of approximately $217 million in Dec 11 from the sale of Avendra to Aramark Corporation. The asset sale fetched the company approximately $20 million in equity earnings from unconsolidated hospitality ventures.We note that these sales are in line with Hyatt’s efforts to strengthen its financial flexibility and focus more on core operation. The sale of assets is helping the company grow through management and licensing arrangements, instead of direct ownership of selective assets. However, Hyatt continues to manage the properties post sale. Notably, a higher concentration of franchise fees reduces earnings volatility and provides a more stable growth profile.Additionally, asset sales are helping Hyatt in terms of strengthening its liquidity. This also allows the company to protect its current liabilities with a combination of cash and liquid assets.The strategic decisions have helped the company’s shares rally 27.3% year to date, outperforming the industry’s gain of 20.8%. Hyatt currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).  Stocks to ConsiderA few better-ranked stocks in the industry include Marriott International (MAR  -  Free Report), Hilton Worldwide Holdings (HLT  -  Free Report) and Choice Hotels International (CHH  -  Free Report), each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

542,HLT,"Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc. (HLT  -  Free Report) continues to expand its upscale brand, Hilton Garden Inn, domestically as well as internationally.Currently, Hilton’s Garden Inn brand comprises over 740 hotels across 33 countries and territories catering to the needs of business and leisure travelers alike.In fact, the brand’s most recent round of hotel openings includes two new properties in the United States and two more across the globe.The first U.S. property is located in Louisville, KY, minutes away from downtown and near many of the city’s best attractions. This 150-roomed hotel also encompasses a fitness center, an indoor pool and a 24-hour business center. The second one is situated in Jacksonville, NC, near one of the nation’s top military training facilities. The property has 128 rooms and boasts of a 5,000-square-foot ballroom.Moreover, the two international locations include one in the center of Shangri-La, China, and another in the Kocaeli province of Turkey.Interestingly, the company is committed to grow its presence in China, going forward. This is because it is a key strategic market where Hilton boasts a robust pipeline that is double its current portfolio in ideal locations.Meanwhile, it is to be noted that all the new properties are part of the company’s industry-leading guest loyalty program - Hilton HHonors loyalty program - which serves millions of members worldwide. In fact, we expect the company’s performance to be buoyed by strong unit development and tremendous growth in its loyalty program, given its scale, size, industry-leading brands and commercial platform.Notably, in January 2017, Hilton completed the spin-offs of Park Hotels & Resorts, Inc. (PK  -  Free Report) and Hilton Grand Vacations Inc. (HGV  -  Free Report) resulting in three independent, publicly traded companies. On the same day, the company put into effect the previously announced 1-for-3 reverse stock split. All these changes are anticipated to make Hilton a fee-based, capital efficient and resilient business, having enormous growth potential worldwide.Post the split on Jan 4, the company’s shares have rallied nearly 9% while the S&P 500 market recorded a gain of 8%.However, Hilton’s international presence makes it vulnerable to lingering political uncertainties and economic downturns in certain parts of the world. Meanwhile, unfavorable currency translations and competition from larger hoteliers like Marriott International, Inc. (MAR  -  Free Report) might also hurt the top line.Nevertheless, aggressive expansion policies augur well for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company.

543,HLT,"Millions of Americans flocked to high-visibility locations on Aug 21 to catch a glimpse of the first solar eclipse in 99 years to cross the entire U.S. continent.Stock markets have historically gained momentum after such solar eclipses. Such a once-in-a-lifetime event provides great business opportunity to travel and leisure companies. This calls for investing in solid stocks from such areas.Stocks Rally on Solar EclipseLPL Financial senior market strategist Ryan Detrick stated that “history has shown us that since 1900, any time a total solar eclipse has been seen in the U.S., equity prices have gone up”. According to him, one year after the last 15 other total solar eclipses visible in the U.S., equity prices have gained an average of 17.2%. Stocks have, in fact, gained a whopping 39.6% after the eclipse in June 1954, while the markets rallied nearly 32% after one eclipse in June 1918.Detrick also figured out that the broader markets tend to rise an average 0.9% in the month following an eclipse, while it climbs 7.2% over the next six months. On a lighter note, he added that “it appears our biggest worry isn’t what stocks might do, but whether those glasses we bought online are officially approved by NASA!”Of course, there are other drivers that correspond with the solar calendar including robust quarterly earnings and economic conditions gaining traction at a steady pace. The Q2 earnings season has almost come to an end, with 474 S&P 500 members having reported quarterly results so far. Total earnings for these companies are up 10.6% from the same period last year on 5.6% higher revenues, with 74.9% beating EPS estimates and 68.4% surpassing the revenue mark (read more: No Shortage of Positive Retail Sector Surprises).Americans, in the meanwhile, have spent more in the spring driving the U.S. economy beyond the $19 trillion mark for the first time. Real gross domestic product rebounded in the second quarter and more than doubled from the preceding quarter (read more: US GDP Crosses $19TN for the First Time: 5 Best Gainers). Here is LPL’s full breakdown of past performance, post-eclipse:Date of EclipseS&P 500 (1-Month Return)S&P 500 (6-Month Return)S&P 500 (12-Month Return)06/08/19184.9%4.5%31.8%09/10/1923-5.6%4.5%10.6%01/24/1925-0.3%10.7%29.9%06/29/19278.5%20.5%22.6%08/31/1932-3.7%-17.4%32.7%02/04/19435%11.5%10.8%07/09/1945-3.5%22.1%20.1%06/30/19545.7%22.4%39.6%10/02/19590.4%-2.9%-6.7%07/02/19635.1%13.4%23%03/07/19700.0%-7.3%11.8%07/10/1972-1.3%10.5%-2.4%02/26/19794.9%11.2%16.7%07/22/1990-9.4%-6.8%7.8%07/11/19912.7%10.8%9.9%Average0.9%7.2%17.2%% Positive53.3%73.3%86.7% Solar Eclipse Gives Public Companies Hopes of Better BusinessAs the total solar eclipse bisected the United States on Aug 21, some of the firms are expected to benefit immensely. CEO and COO Larry D. De Shon of car rental company, Avis Budget Group Inc. (CAR  -  Free Report) said that eclipse helped push rental prices higher. Maven, the on-demand car sharing brand from General Motors (GM  -  Free Report), had offered a $10 discount code ECLIPSE for travelers to move towards the eclipse lookout point.  And with millions of Americans hitting the road to catch a glimpse of the once-in-a-century solar eclipse, such a move will surely lift the company’s margins.Financial and bank holding company, First Interstate Bancsystem Inc (FIBK  -  Free Report) has more than 120 offices in the states of Idaho, Montana, Oregon, South Dakota, Wyoming and Washington. These are some of the key states that experienced the total solar eclipse and with millions flocking to these states, the bank’s business will surely get a shot in the arm.Many brands also geared up to cash in on this rare event. Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd RCL aptly named its cruise Total Eclipse, where Bonnie Tyler sang “Total Eclipse of the Heart”. And for those who haven’t traveled, Discovery Communications Inc’s DISCA Science Channel gave live eclipse coverage all through the day.Solar Eclipse a Bonanza for Airlines, HotelsAirlines have largely benefitted from this once in a lifetime event, as many traveled to large parts of the country that are typically rural regions and don’t see much tourist traffic. In fact, Alaska Airlines (ALK  -  Free Report) organized for invitation-only flights for “astronomy enthusiasts” who wanted a sighting of the eclipse in the skies. Southwest Airlines (LUV  -  Free Report) also earmarked certain flights that helped travelers view the eclipse from high above the clouds.CNBC’s Eric Chemi noted that hotel bookings in some parts of the country, which were mostly along the eclipse path, skyrocketed 400%. Representatives from online marketplace and hospitality service, Airbnb declared that the site logged more than 40,000 guest bookings as of Jul 31.Many hotel chains like Marriott International Inc (MAR  -  Free Report) offered packages to commuters who head to cities in the path of the eclipse. The company reported that the number of rooms booked in 16 locations was up 60% from last year. Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc (HLT  -  Free Report) is another firm that tried to entice customers with special offers, while InterContinental Hotels Group PLC (IHG  -  Free Report), another large hotel chain, said last month that two of its three Nashville, Tennessee, hotels were sold out.Top 5 WinnersWith solar eclipse primarily being a boon for airlines, cruises and hotel industries, investing in fundamentally sound stocks from such areas seems prudent.

546,HLT,"Founded in 2008 by Brian Chesky, Joe Gebbia, and Nathan Blecharczyk, Airbnb is an app and website that connects people seeking lodging with renters who have listed their personal houses, apartments, guest rooms, etc., on either platform. Travelers can book accommodations around the world online or from a tablet or mobile phone.Airbnb is an easy way for people to monetize any extra living space they have. With over 3 million listings worldwide—including 1,400 castles—it operates in over 65,000 cities and 191 countries, the company has a total guest list of more than 150 million people.Airbnb as a LifestyleBack in 2014, Airbnb announced a huge, company-wide rebranding, indicating a desire to transition from a hotel service to a lifestyle brand. Since its inception, it has been easy to categorize the company as just another hotel option, taking on big industry names like Wyndham , Hyatt (H  -  Free Report), Hilton Worldwide (HLT  -  Free Report), and InterContinental Hotels (IHG  -  Free Report).But its brand upheaval demonstrates how Airbnb has the potential to be something much more. In a blog post, the company stated they want to possess a logo that will be seen on a variety of products, houses, and businesses, to make sure people understand that whoever owns it is a supporter of their ideal—but, more importantly, a supporter of their brand.Dubbed Bélo, its logo is a symbol of belonging. While it may look like a misshapen paperclip, Bélo is a “symbol for people who want to welcome into their home new experiences, new cultures, and new conversations.” Airbnb has also redesigned its website and app, which are now far cleaner than previous versions, and feature subtle animations and flashier imagery.Controversies to ConsiderAirbnb may present a legitimate challenge to the hotel industry, but the company is enveloped by controversy and regulatory issues in cities that are none too pleased with residents turning their homes into hotels, reflecting similar problems that plague companies like Uber.In San Francisco, critics have blamed Airbnb for the growing vacancy rates and the over $3,900 average monthly rent. Average home prices in the city recently hit the $1.1 million median mark, and San Francisco’s population has reached an all-time high, according to Paragon Real Estate Group.Despite the absence of a permit, which, according to law, one must have in order to rent for under 30 days, San Francisco residents are still illegally listing personal homes and apartments for less than the required number of days on Airbnb. And, legislation was approved in San Francisco last June that would require anyone listing available property on Airbnb or other sites to register the property with the city, most likely hindering a person’s ability to casually list a spare room for some extra cash going forwardThe company is also embroiled in a long-standing battle with New York City, where they face similar issues as in San Francisco. Last fall, the New York State Senate passed a bill that makes online apartment listings for stays shorter than 30 days illegal, which, not surprisingly, thwarts Airbnb in their goal to expand its market.Shortly after, Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed that bill into law, with politicians, local hoteliers, and affordable housing advocates hailing the decision as a victory. Some have calculated that the law has deleted roughly half of Airbnb listings in New York. “To avoid fees, hosts in large apartment buildings can only rent rooms or beds in their houses, not their entire apartment,” notes Travel + Leisure, while hosts who rent entire homes or row houses will not be affected.But Airbnb’s biggest challenge may have been dealing with the #AirbnbWhileBlack controversy, which was a recent protest movement against multiple instances of the company’s hosts apparently declining guests due to skin color. Airbnb admitted that a problem exists, and at the time, said it was trying to tackle the problem by educating hosts and guests, and by responding to concerns they raise.Commenting at the 2016 Fortune Brainstorm Tech conference, CEO Chesky said that “We were so focused on creating trust and safety that we took our eye off the ball on this other important issue,” Chesky said. “There were lots of things we didn’t think about when we, as three white guys, designed the platform.”IPO BuzzSince 2014, and regardless of its fight with certain cities, rumors have been swirling of Airbnb’s inevitable initial public offering, even though CEO Chesky said no to an IPO at that time. In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, Chesky said that “we will do it at a time when it benefits the company, when we have a good reason.”Airbnb’s last valuation clocked in at $31 billion—it’s worth only about $15 billion less than Marriot (MAR  -  Free Report)—thanks to its latest billion-dollar round of equity funding, making it the second most valuable U.S. startup behind Uber. This, as well as being a recognized name in the hotel industry and sharing economy, is helping raise buzz. Their popularity among venture capitalists (VCs) is helping increase hype, too.However, this new round of funding, in addition to a separate deal where investors are planning to buy $200 million in stock from Airbnb employees, could be seen as a move to relieve some of the pressure of filing for an IPO. Airbnb is adding significantly to its amount of available cash, allowing it to spend enough and continue its global expansion without going public.Airbnb is also reportedly watching fellow tech unicorn Spotify, and what IPO route the music streaming giant will take. According to The Wall Street Journal, Airbnb may want to mimic Spotify’s unconventional plans; Spotify is planning to list its shares directly on the New York Stock Exchange without raising a new round of funding (also read: Spotify is Likely Going Public Without an IPO: Will Other Tech Unicorns Follow?)This move benefits private companies who don’t need cash, “but want a way for employees, founders, and other shareholders to start trading their shares,” notes Business Insider.How Might an Airbnb IPO Perform?Thanks to Snap Inc.’s (SNAP  -  Free Report) very successful IPO last March, the spotlight is shining with renewed intensity on startups like Airbnb, and investors are wondering if the online hospitality marketplace will file for an IPO this year.Like other tech companies, Airbnb is a company for the digital age, and many are wanting to be the first ones to invest in its expected success. Billions of dollars have been invested in the digital sharing economy over the past few years—specifically, in companies whose platforms are apps and websites that connect a person selling an item or service with a consumer who wants to use that item or service.Particularly, Airbnb is popular because it is inexpensive to run; it doesn’t have to build or maintain hotels or hotel staff. The company is also easy to grow quickly, as there is no need for a physical office in every country, just consumers with a smartphone.Like any tech startup, Airbnb’s IPO will be a toss-up. Its valuation is impressive in and of itself, and will most likely be the driving factor for investors come time for a public entrance into the market. Airbnb needs to keep an eye on their increasing competition. Companies like Roomorama, Homeaway, and the Expedia (EXPE)-owned Housetrip all have a dedicated following of their own, and are all beginning to eat into the market share.Despite rival companies and regulatory issues, Airbnb has the potential to be one of the hottest upcoming IPOs. With billions of dollars in investments already, a thriving rebranding, and its rising popularity among travelers, Airbnb’s IPO is one to watch out for.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time. It’s a once-in-a-generation opportunity to invest in pure genius. Click for details >>

However, North American comparable company-operated house profit margins decreased 10 bps.
