"
9,CTXS,"""Avoiding behavioral risk"" is more than a Wall Street slogan to Vladimir ""Val"" de Vassal. It is a tactic he has raised to an art form as he aims to remove subjectivity from his hunt for top-performing growth stocks for two Glenmede mutual funds of which he's lead manager. Fueled in recent quarters by leading growth stocks like Apple (AAPL), Adobe Systems (ADBE) and Mastercard (MA), $4 billion Large Cap Growth (GTLLX) and $2.9 billion Large Cap Core (GTLOX) both outperformed the S&P 500 in calendar 2017 as well as over the three, five and 10 years ended Dec. 31.Only 10% of U.S. diversified stock funds with at least $100 million in assets racked up that four-way feat, which makes them winners of the 2018 IBD Best Mutual Funds Award.De Vassal and his team — including managers Paul Sullivan and Alex Attanasiu — have become adept at avoiding behavioral risk in their investment process. Instead, they focus on more than 80 objective yardsticks to measure each growth stock's worthiness. They wear blinders to block out less-meaningful information that can be distractions from data that mark growth stocks poised to advance. Emotions are a major part of behavioral risk, de Vassal says.De Vassal, age 58, talked with IBD about his strategy from his office in Philadelphia.Best Mutual Funds Monthly Performance ReportIBD: How do your growth-oriented mutual funds differ from rival growth funds?De Vassal: First, both funds use a similar process. The difference is the benchmark. For Core, it is the Russell 1000 Index. For Large Cap Growth, it is the Russell Growth. We control industry and sector exposures against those benchmarks.Our strategies are a blend of quantitative discipline based on underlying fundamental insights.IBD: How do you avoid letting emotions interfere with your hunt for growth stocks?De Vassal: We've built a library of factors, over 80, across the two strategies. In any sector, there are about 15 to 25 factors that we use to differentiate stocks. They're a combination of such things as valuation metrics, fundamental metrics and estimate revisions from sell-side analysts. We include some technical indicators as well.IBD: Give me examples of subjective metrics that you avoid.De Vassal: Subjective metrics that we do not use include the popularity of a company — its brand name — and nonquantifiable intangibles such as future products and profits that are not reflected in sell-side analyst earnings or revenue estimates. ... We want to remove behavioral risks that may have adverse effects on portfolio performance.IBD: Limiting downside risk plays a big role in your approach, right?De Vassal: We aim to win by avoiding negative earnings surprises and at the same time tilting more toward stocks that are more likely to have positive surprises.IBD: Basically, the difference between these two funds is that one focuses exclusively on growth stocks while Core Fund can own various types of stocks?De Vassal: In simplest terms, yes. And that means Large Cap Growth has much heavier concentration in technology stocks, for example.IBD: These funds are 2018 IBD Best Mutual Funds Award winners. What does it take to outperform so consistently?De Vassal: We have a very disciplined process. And both portfolios are well diversified. Performance isn't driven by being lucky or unlucky in one or two names. And we try to avoid losers, not just identify winners. We try to improve every year. This year we added two new stock selection factors. One is supply-chain data. The other is ESG (environomental, social and governance) momentum. We've been managing for some form of ESG strategy for over 15 years. We've found ESG momentum works better in some sectors, like consumer staples, consumer discretionary and technology, than in others.IBD: Do you see the iPhone as the key to Apple's future? Or do you see additional services like the App Store, Apple Music and Apple Pay, playing a bigger role?De Vassal: We look at fundamental metrics like return on invested capital. We look at valuation. We look at cash flow per employee. We look at sell-side analysts' earnings estimates, revenue estimates, cash flow estimates. We ask ourselves whether new products and services are causing analysts to increase their estimates. (A sell-side analyst works for an outside firm, not the fund.)We don't have a fundamental analyst kicking the tires on Apple. We look at what's happened in the past. Which (outside) analysts have been the most accurate, looking back nine quarters? Then we look at what they have to say.IBD: Avoiding emotion in your decisions is a key part of your search for growth stocks. What's an example of that?De Vassal: Growth Fund started its stake in Adobe Systems in October. The stock was attractively valued. Later that month they gave (positive) guidance and the stock shot up. We sold in November with a gain over 18%. When a stock moves, we're out because it's no longer attractive.IBD: Mastercard earnings per share growth has accelerated for three quarters. What's your view going forward?De Vassal: We bought it in June 2016. It's done well. It's a holding. We're comfortable with it. But it's not a position we would add to.IBD: You've got Visa (V) as well. Do you like it better?De Vassal: At this point, Visa looks a little more attractive. Mastercard outperformed over the past 12 months, so its valuation is up. Visa's is better. Visa is still a buy for us.IBD: IPG Photonics (IPGP) is another newcomer to Growth Fund. Do you still like it?De Vassal: We started this in August 2017. The valuation was reasonable. Cash flow yield was around 2.4%. Not that strong. But fundamentals were good. Revisions were fairly positive. Price momentum was fairly good. We think revisions are more likely to have positive surprises than negative surprises.IBD: You more than doubled your share count in TD Ameritrade (AMTD) recently. Why?De Vassal: It was September 2017 when we doubled. Its dividend yield was reasonable, and so were its profitability metrics. Analysts were raising their earnings and revenue estimates. It got good (share) price momentum. We've done well with it.IBD: Brick and mortar retailers aren't very popular these days. But you've got discounter Ross Stores (ROST). Why?De Vassal: We still consider it a buy. We've been underweight in consumer discretionary. But we're getting more neutral. Part of the reason is rebalancing the portfolio in industry groups. Looking at Ross' metrics, it's got a healthy combination of valuation, fundamentals and sell-side earnings revisions.IBD: Citrix Systems (CTXS) is in Core Fund. What's driving the speed up in its quarterly EPS growth?De Vassal: It has good profitability metrics. And we've seen more analysts covering the stock, which could lead to increased investors interest.IBD: What's driving the uptrend in CBRE Group (CBRE), which provides property management, loan servicing and origination services?De Vassal: This is one of the best ranked REITs based on our proprietary stock-ranking screens. In terms of metrics, we look at EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) and we look at the consistency of its risk-adjusted growth. Analysts are raising their estimates consistently.IBD: You've trimmed your exposure to Nvidia (NVDA). Does that mean you don't like it as much anymore?De Vassal: We cap a stock's maximum weighting at 2% of Core Fund and 3% of Growth. In contrast, benchmarks are too top heavy. They have too much exposure to the top names.We initially pursued Nvidia in Core in May 2016. The stock had an attractive valuation and improving fundamentals and estimate revisions. Its share price gained a lot, and it bumped our 2% limit so we had to trim it. It has continued up. It's no longer cheap, and it's not a position we would add to.IBD: What has driven the uptrend by F5 Networks (FFIV), which makes data center computing gear?De Vassal: Its valuation isn't cheap, but it's reasonable. Its fundamentals have been strong. Its return on invested capital and cash flow per employee have been favorable vs. its peers. It's got increased coverage from sell-side analysts. So there's a stronger likelihood for positive earnings surprises than some of its peers have.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE:Growth Stocks In Tech And Health Care: Fund Managers Like Their OutlookSee Which Stock The Best Mutual Funds Have Been BuyingU.S. Treasuries Led Bond Funds Higher As 10-Year Yield Tumbled To 2.8%You Need This Much Retirement Savings At Your Age And IncomeFour Ways You Can Cut Spending In Retirement — With Little Lifestyle Sacrifice

17,CTXS,"On Wednesday, Citrix Systems (CTXS) got a positive adjustment to its Relative Strength (RS) Rating, from 69 to 74. X IBD's proprietary RS Rating identifies market leadership by showing how a stock's price movement over the last 52 weeks compares to that of the other stocks in our database. History reveals that the best stocks typically have an RS Rating of at least 80 as they begin their biggest climbs. See if Citrix Systems can continue to show renewed price strength and clear that threshold. See How IBD Helps You Make More Money In StocksCitrix Systems broke out earlier, but has fallen back below the prior 88.09 entry from a consolidation. If a stock you're watching climbs above a buy point then falls 7% or more below the original entry price, it's considered a failed base. It's best to wait for the stock to form a new consolidation and breakout. Also keep in mind that the latest consolidation is a later-stage base, which makes it riskier to establish a new position or add shares to an existing one. Citrix Systems reported 13% earnings growth in the latest quarterly report. Sales increased 3%. The company earns the No. 8 rank among its peers in the Computer Software-Special Enterprise industry group. Atlassian (TEAM),  (MFGP) and Tyler Technologies (TYL) are among the top 5 highly rated stocks within the group.RELATED:Which Stocks Are Showing Improved Technical Action?Why Should You Use IBD's Relative Strength Rating?How Relative Strength Line Can Help You Judge A Stock

Over the next several days, the major averages could confirm a new market uptrend. But corrections often have short-lived rally attempts, followed by renewed selling. The next objective is for the key indexes to retake their 50-day moving lines, with the Nasdaq closest to that key level.Before the market open, investors will get January readings on the consumer price index and retail sales. The CPI will get close attention given the renewed inflation and Federal Reserve fears stemming from rising bond yields and accelerating wage gains. The CPI is expected to show a 0.1% monthly rise, or 0.3% excluding food and energy, according to Econoday.

Microsoft arguably is a buy. LogMeIn is setting up in a cup-with-handle base with earnings on tap Thursday. All are highly rated: Adobe Systems, Paycom and LogMeIn have best-possible 99 Composite Ratings. Workday has a 97 Composite Rating. The Composite Rating is an overall score for stocks based on a variety of fundamental and technical factors.

But is that buy point still valid? Microsoft erased an 11% gain from the entry during the market sell-off. Normally, a stock that round-trips a double-digit gain means that the entry no longer applies. But given the stock's relatively strong performance in the correction it would be understandable if investors bought it in a hypothetical confirmed market uptrend.Adobe stock edged up 0.7% to 193.48 on Tuesday, reclaiming a 186.37 entry on Friday. The stock hasn't closed below its 50-day line during the recent market correction.Workday advanced 0.9% to 116.63 on Tuesday after moving back above a 114.98 entry on Monday. Shares tested their 50-day line last Friday but rallied for a gain that day.Paycom shot up 5.2% to 88.90 on Tuesday, back above an 86.20 entry point.

""Their revolutionary product addresses this big problem — how to collaborate effectively in teams. It's no accident their stock ticker is TEAM.""Atlassian's Jira, the number one software tool for software developers, allows companies to plan, track and release their software by reporting real-time progress and issue tracking. The price point is low at around $7 per user in a medium size firm or just a $10 flat rate for teams up to 10 users and is popular with help desk and information technology specialists.The inexpensive price is a huge benefit in attracting users as Atlassian doesn't have an enterprise sales force. Instead it works with the ""land and expand"" model, according to Oliver. One user can easily download the software and get the rest of the team to follow, making the product viral at a company thanks to its user-friendly interface and flexibility, he says.Oliver says Atlassian is a very high margin company because most other software firms are spending nearly half their operating budget on sales and marketing.Atlassian has a market cap of $12.43 billion and 112,000 customers, ranging from online dating app Tinder to Domino's Pizza (DPZ) to the U.S. Defense Department.""The platform is very nimble and fits well into the new way people are developing products,"" Oliver said.Other Atlassian products include Confluence, a document collaboration service; Crucible, which uses peer review to find bugs in code; and HipChat, a company hosted group chat and video service. The company also hosts Atlassian Marketplace, which has over 3,500 applications built on Atlassian's offerings.Last year, the company bought Trello, which helps organize projects with visual boards, for $425 million.

The first one is ""plan, track and support,"" the second is ""collaborative and chats"" like Trello and the third is ""code, build and ship.""IBD'S TAKE: Atlassian is part of the Computer Software-Specialty Enterprise group, which is ranked No. 91 out of the 197 industry groups IBD tracks and includes VMware (VMW) and Citrix Systems (CTXS). Atlassian is also 17th on the IBD 50 list. Shares have more than doubled in the last year, though they recently fell out of buy range with the market downturn.Atlassian was founded in Sydney in 2002 by Mike Cannon-Brookes and Scott Farquhar using credit card debt to fund development. The company went public in December 2015 and now the pair have a cult following in their native Australia. Farquhar recently bought the most expensive house in the entire country.""These guys have created a unique culture where they attract really great employees and retain them,"" Oliver said. ""The competition for developer talent is very high.""McKesson (MCK) Chief Financial Officer James Beer was appointed as new CFO starting this month and Majek said the change poses no risk to the company.Last month Atlassian reported fiscal second-quarter results that beat views but gave weak guidance for the third quarter.Oliver said the company was ""completely unique"" but that doesn't mean that other tech firms are going to stand by and let Atlassian dominate the market space and future of collaborative work.Microsoft revamped its offering, which it calls Teams, last year to integrate its Office 365 apps. IBM's (IBM) IBM Collaboration Solutions has its own collaboration products, and privately held Slack's messaging and file sharing service has more than 6 million daily users. Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google Docs offers collaborative online work options.As competition heats up and Atlassian grows, the company is becoming a more valuable property.""Atlassian could become an acquisition target down the road,"" Oliver said, as companies get an influx of cash from the Trump administration's corporate tax reform.But the company isn't free of downside risks. Cybersecurity is a risk for tech firms and last year some HipChat passwords were exposed during a data breach. However, Atlassian has a cybersecurity team in place to deal with issues and asks users to report any problems. It has a Security Hall of Fame listing people who disclosed vulnerabilities.Oliver said it's yet to be seen if Atlassian can fend off competition while continuing to sustain its growth, but he thinks they are ""very well positioned.""Majek said its biggest risk is one of the things that makes the company unique, its current sales structure as it grows further.Majek said Wall Street is expecting a deceleration in growth in sales to 38% in fiscal 2018, then to 28% in fiscal 2019 and 25% in 2020.""Companies with that model struggle to pass the billion-dollar mark in sales,"" he said. ""Either they will have to grow a lot slower or get a sales team.""Shares of the company were down 1.3% near 48 in afternoon trades Friday.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Why 2018 Software M&A Is Likely To Pick Up, With SaaS Firms EyedStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth Stocks

31,CTXS,"It's hard to think of LogMeIn (LOGM) as an underdog anymore.This scrappy tech firm took on the likes of Cisco (CSCO), Microsoft (MSFT) and Citrix (CTXS) and pioneered remote access to desktop and handheld devices via cloud computing. Now it's turning its guns on targets like Salesforce.com (CRM), Oracle (ORCL) and Zendesk (ZEN).XEarly this year, it tripled in size overnight to become one of the world's top 10 Software-as-a-Service, or SaaS, companies based on revenue, thanks to its $1.8 billion merger with Citrix's GoTo business.""The company is well on its way to its three-year, post-acquisition targets, and we believe the cash flow opportunity still justifies a much higher stock price,"" JPMorgan analyst Sterling Auty wrote in a recent note to clients, after LogMeIn disclosed financial results for the third quarter. JPMorgan is a market maker in LogMeIn shares.Based in Boston, LogMeIn offers software tools for cloud connectivity and collaboration, secure device access, and remote customer support. For an increasingly mobile and global workforce, it offers products such as Join.me, for online meetings; GoToWebinar, for online seminars; GoToAssist, for online assistance; and LastPass, for online password management.Now LogMeIn is at that point where it's an established tech player, yet small enough with around $1 billion in annual sales to generate powerful growth.Thanks in part to a 23% annual pretax profit margin and 26% annual return on equity, LogMeIn ranks No. 1 out of 56 companies in IBD's enterprise software group. ServiceNow (NOW), Paycom Software (PAYC), Blackbaud (BLKB) and Salesforce round out the top five.Within its core markets, LogMeIn is growing fastest in what is known as the identity business. LastPass, a product that offers simple and secure access to apps, devices and data, is doing especially well.In an email interview with Investor's Business Daily, LogMeIn Chief Executive Bill Wagner described his company as a leader in serving small and medium businesses. LogMeIn also counts millions of individuals among its customers, as well as the largest technology providers such as Dell Technologies (DVMT) and HP Inc. (HPQ); the world's biggest telcos like Verizon (VZ) and Australia's Telstra; and familiar Silicon Valley growth names like Evernote and Dropbox.A key market where LogMeIn sees long-term growth opportunity is a realm known as Unified Communications and Collaboration. It's one that has emerged as traditional enterprise collaboration vendors such as Microsoft and IBM (IBM), as well as traditional enterprise communication vendors like Cisco, have made inroads into each other's turfs.""Prior to the (GoTo) merger, our popular Join.me product was a high growth disrupter in the collaboration market,"" Wagner said. ""Now we have products like GoMeeting, GoToWebinar, OpenVoice and Grasshopper, which essentially bolstered our annual (communications and collaboration) sales by an order of magnitude.""JPMorgan's Auty says LogMeIn built a successful franchise in remote access, then added several related high-growth businesses around that core, such as web conferencing. Yet he sees room for even more. Auty noted that LogMeIn hit a targeted $100 million in cost synergies a year ahead of plan, and revenue synergies are already starting to kick in. For example, LogMeIn consolidated 50% of data centers and is successfully cross-selling LastPass subscriptions to GoTo customers.Beyond software applications, Auty sees a ""larger opportunity"" in providing a cloud platform for companies tied to the Internet of Things.A LogMeIn spokesperson told IBD that the company's fledgling IoT efforts are centered on customer engagement and support. That could pit it directly against Salesforce's Service Cloud as well as Oracle and Zendesk.It's all showing up in the quarterly results. During the third quarter, LogMeIn logged triple-digit earnings and revenue gains, while cash flow from operations surged to $90.5 million, a hefty 33% of revenue. The company also raised guidance for profits and free-cash-flow margins for 2017 as a whole.Shares briefly shot to an all-time high of 129.52 but now sit 7% below that peak, undercutting a 121.35 entry they cleared in October. Still, they are up about 24% year to date, while the S&P 500 has risen 16% over the same period.Auty rates LogMeIn stock as overweight and upped his price target from 140 to 145.In February, CEO Wagner hinted at ""big ambitions"" while alluding to a next generation of cloud technologies.IBD'S TAKE: Software stocks and cloud players have a strong presence in the IBD 50 list of top growth stocks, where you can find new ideas for your investing watchlist.Just a handful of months later, the company acquired the Israeli firm Nanorep. An artificial intelligence, or AI, and machine learning expert, Nanorep already makes chatbots and virtual agents ""more human"" for hundreds of companies across the world, including Intuit (INTU), FedEx (FDX) and Vodafone (VOD), according to LogMeIn.The acquisition accelerates LogMeIn's efforts in the rapidly growing market for digital customer service — one that it expects to balloon from 3% of all customer service interactions in 2017 to 30% by 2022.Wagner told IBD that the $45 million Nanorep deal builds on his company's history of disruptive innovation.""We were an early innovator in the 'freemium' business model, a structure we relied upon for our organic growth in the early days of the company and one that has been copied by many other successful technology companies,"" Wagner said.That model, of converting free users to paid or premium subscribers, was successfully deployed by Join.me. It offered single-click, frictionless sharing of screens, showing up older rivals like Cisco's WebEx and Citrix's GoToMeeting. GoToMeeting is now part of LogMeIn's portfolio.Launched in October 2010, Join.me was recognized as the fastest-growing web-conferencing product less than five years later.LogMeIn is now looking to harness Nanorep's AI expertise across its entire, newly expanded suite of product offerings. With GoTo under its belt, the company says it supports 25 million users and 900 million conferencing minutes every month, as well as roughly 200 million customer engagements and 5 billion voice minutes every year.But as LogMeIn targets new markets, challenges await. Patent litigation could resurface and roil the stock, experts caution. Plus, upstarts like Splashtop and TeamViewer are moving into remote access, support and monitoring.Competition in this increasingly crowded space is expected to drive down prices, with only the strongest players likely to survive.Still, analyst expectations for future growth have marched up, notwithstanding LogMeIn's formidable annual 45% earnings growth rate and 46% sales growth rate over the past three years.Consensus estimates call for annual earnings of $3.28 per share in 2017, up from $2.03 in 2016 and from $1.66 in 2015. Earnings are seen climbing to $4.10 a share in 2018, according to Zacks Investment Research.Revenue is forecast at $1.02 billion in 2017, ballooning from $336 million in 2016 and from $272 million in 2015. It is seen rising to $1.17 billion in 2018.LogMeIn's free cash flow, a key valuation metric, has especially impressed industry analysts. Its free-cash-flow margin is now expected to be 30% for the year and to expand to more than 33% in 2019, said Matthew Hedberg of RBC Capital Markets.Investors and analysts await the strategic road map that Wagner is set to discuss at an event on Dec. 19.""We think the event could be a catalyst as management updates longer-term targets,"" Hedberg wrote on Oct. 26, calling LogMeIn a ""favorite idea"" for the rest of this year. He rates LogMeIn stock an outperform and hiked his price target from 140 to 143.RELATED:Could This IBD 50 Software Stock Be The Next Cloud-Transition Star After Adobe?Stocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth Stocks

The companies currently with the most overseas cash are Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Cisco Systems (CSCO), Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google and Oracle (ORCL). Many Wall Street analysts have speculated that cash brought back into the U.S. could be used for stock buybacks or acquisitions.Goldman Sachs in a report focuses on stocks with the highest overseas cash-to-equity cap ratio. The top seven companies, Goldman Sachs says, would be Cisco, NetApp (NTAP), Qualcomm (QCOM), Apple, Amgen (AMGN), Oracle and Microsoft.A bit further down would be Western Digital (WDC), Citrix Systems (CTXS), General Electric (GE) and Abbott Laboratories (ABT).Goldman Sachs forecasts that U.S. firms would repatriate $250 billion of their overseas cash in 2018, if a tax reform package is approved.IBD'S TAKE: Try out premium IBD features for free through Oct. 8.

42,CTXS,"MFS Mid Cap Growth Fund (OTCIX) is revving its engine, improving its performance relative to its peers and the S&P 500. The $2.3 billion fund topped 64% of its midcap growth rivals tracked by Morningstar Inc. over the 12 months going into Wednesday. It improved to 84% outperformance year-to-date and 91% in the past three months.Up 15.52% this year vs. 12.45% for its peer group and 9.47% for the big-cap bogey, manager Paul Gordon pins the improvement on the market rotating back toward the types of growth stocks favored by him and fellow managers Eric Fischman and Matthew Sabel. ""Last year as people started to gain additional confidence in the economy, a lot more cyclical lower valuation companies started to rally,"" Gordon said. ""They had an extreme rally after the Trump election. But that's typically not an area we invest in. We look for long-term, not short-term, valuation opportunities. This year has been a reversal of that trend, back toward secular growth companies.""Holdings that have notched nice gains this year include graphics chip maker Nvidia (NVDA), which is up 38% so far this year; chipmaker Monolithic Power Systems (MPWR), which is up 23%; and design-automation-software maker Cadence Design Systems (CDNS), which is up 40%.Nvidia is a member of the IBD 50 list of stocks with strong relative price strength and fundamentals. Gains have left Nvidia, Monolithic and Cadence share prices extended, outside their buy ranges for investors looking for optimal entry points.Other holdings that have posted good gains are still within buy ranges.Edwards Lifesciences (EW), a maker of heart valves and other vascular disease products, is a stock in which Gordon's fund has raised its share count in recent disclosures. It has a best-possible 99 Composite Rating from IBD.""This medical device company has a product that is a better way of doing traditional aortic valve replacement surgery,"" Gordon said. ""It tends to provide better medical results and safety. We think the runway is long for them to continue to increase (the number of) procedures to be done this way going forward.""IBD'S TAKE: In addition to Edwards Lifesciences' sterling 99 Composite Rating, it has four consecutive years of annual earnings per share growth. See how its easy-to-understand fundamental and technical data stack up against rivals' at IBD's Stock Checkup.LogMeIn (LOGM) is another stock in which the fund has been building its stake. Earnings per share for the maker of business and videoconferencing software rose 22%, 22% and 143% the past three quarters. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect second-quarter profit to rise a very good 90% to 93 cents a share.""They have a nice market share within a niche market,"" Gordon said. ""They recently purchased an asset called (GetGo, whose products include GoToMeeting and related offerings) from Citrix Systems (CTXS). I think they have an opportunity to improve that business. For Citrix, it was not part of their core business, so it did not get (maximum) attention within a bigger company. Now it is very complementary to what LogMeIn knows and does.""Software maker SS&C Technologies (SSNC) is up 36% so far this year. Gordon said, ""They provide back-office software for financial companies. They're taking share from in-house and other third parties. This company sold off last year at the height of (investors') fear about a decline in hedge-fund growth. But this stock has recovered.""Five Below (FIVE) offers trendy, high-quality brands that sell for $5 or less in its 500-plus stores. It plans to open 100 more in 2017-2018.""What we like about Five Below is that it is a bit of a combination of Dollar Store and off-price store, so it sells low-priced items that change seasonally and are attractive to customers because they (require) a bit of a treasure hunt. They're a fun place to shop for fairly cheap, consumable items. The total store opportunity for the company is fairly large. The returns on new stores are very high. So they are able to get great footage growth at high rates within their cash flow, and we think they should continue.""Shares are up 30% this year. IBD readers would recognize that on Wednesday afternoon they were trading a shade below their 52.80 entry point.Gordon summarizes the fund's strategy as ""focusing on secular growth companies in which we have high confidence of long duration of above-average earnings growth.""If the market is performing a Trump Dump — rotating away from lower valued cyclical stocks that could benefit from Trump policies — that should provide the fund with only a small additional tailwind. Gordon said, ""It might provide some opportunities, but only on the margin to find additional names to add to the portfolio.""Over the past 10 years the fund's average annual return of 6.13% topped only 31% of its direct rivals. Managers Fischman, Gordon and Sabel joined the fund in 2008, 2011 and 2014 respectively.RELATED:A Top Mutual Fund's Portfolio: Trump-Era Stock Plays, Plus Stocks To Like No Matter Who's PresidentMFS Aligns Management Teams On Growth Fund And Mid Cap Growth

54,CTXS,"A tail wind has kicked up this calendar year behind $7.5 billion American Century Growth Fund (TWCGX). That's nice news for investors holding the fund in retirement accounts and other portfolios. The fund's 9.93% gain this year going into Thursday topped 73% of the fund's large-cap growth rivals tracked by Morningstar Inc. That's a step up from the 67% of peers the fund outperformed over the trailing 12 months with a 16.40% return.Managers Gregory Woodhams and Justin Brown pick stocks individually and not based on sectors, but their sector weights show where they expect to find leaders. Technology was their top sector as of Jan. 31, with a 34% weighting. Consumer discretionary was next with 20%.Tech titans Alphabet (GOOGL), Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT) — the fund's first, third and fifth largest holdings — illustrate that appetite. Alphabet is up 7% so far this year. Apple is up 24%. Microsoft is up 5%. Together they account for about 14% of the fund's assets.Several top new buys as of Dec. 31 also belonged to the tech sector. Among those was chipmaker Broadcom (AVGO), which is up 25% so far this year. The stock has a highest-possible Comp Rating of 99.IBD'S TAKE: Broadcom is ranked No. 1 in the No. 37-rated Electronics-Semiconductor Fabless industry group. It has four quarters in a row of accelerating earnings per share growth. See how its additional easy-to-understanding fundamental and technical data stack up against rivals' at IBD's Stock Checkup.Another top new buy was Activision Blizzard (ATVI), which is up 39% this year. The video game stock is ranked No. 2 in IBD's Computer Software-Gaming group, thanks in part to traits like its very strong 97 Comp Rating. In addition, the stock is on the IBD 50 list of stocks with strong relative price strength and fundamentals.Tuesday was the stock's ex-dividend date, meaning that you had to own shares before that to be eligible for its dividend. Its dividend yield Monday was 0.6%.A negative: EPS growth has decelerated for two quarters, from 315% to 152% and 11%. Analysts see EPS falling 9% in the current quarter and 11% this year, and then rising 21% in 2018, in line with its three-year growth rate.Financials were just the fund's sixth-largest sector, with a modest 4% weighting. One of those was Citizens Financial (CFG), a top new buy whose EPS growth has accelerated for three quarters in a row.Still, the stock is down 3% this year after tumbling 13% off its March 1 high. That pullback along with the broad market reflects investors' concerns that Congress' failure to revise or kill ObamaCare is a sign that additional Trump initiatives, such as corporate and individual tax cuts and lighter regulatory burdens for banks, may not be as likely as investors had hoped.Shares of Citrix Systems (CTXS), yet another newcomer to the portfolio, surged March 13 on rumors of a company sale. The company's business software creates work spaces that provide access to desktops, apps, data and communications on any device, over networks and in the cloud.As IBD recently reported, Citrix has been pressured by activist investor Elliott Management to make changes. On Feb. 1, Citrix completed its spinoff of its GoToMeeting business, which then merged with LogMeIn (LOGM). GoToMeeting is a conferencing application that allows remote access to personal computers.Citrix shares are up 20% this year. The cloud computing company's most recent EPS report was for Q4, in January. It earned $1.61 a share on sales of $908 million. That topped consensus for EPS of $1.50 and revenue of $900.8 million. But the $1.61 was a decline of 3%.The company forecast 2017 EPS of $4.60-$4.65 and revenue of $2.81 billion to $2.84 billion. Both are well below consensus for $5.60 EPS and sales of $3.55 billion, but Citrix's guidance excludes GoToMeeting.VMware (VMW) is another new buy for the fund. The server virtualization leader is up 17% this year. EPS grew 0%, 4%, 12% and 13% the past four quarters.VMware paid $1.3 billion to buy Niciria, a software-defined networking company, three years ago. VMware said recently it expects $1 billion in sales of NSX, made possible by that acquisition. NSX lets companies update networks through software changes rather than the more costly path of replacing routers and switching hardware.NSX is a challenge to Cisco Systems' (CSCO) flagship networking software product, called Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI).In the consumer discretionary sector, bellwether Amazon (AMZN) and auto-parts chain O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY) were the fund's second- and seventh-largest holdings as of Jan. 31.Amazon has been trending mostly sideways since mid-February, hanging on to a 17% gain so far this year.O'Reilly is down 1% this year. RELATED:IBD's Best Mutual Funds 2017 Awards: New Crop Of WinnersFacebook, Alphabet Among Hot Tech Stocks American Century Growth Mutual Fund Likes

55,CTXS,"A downgrade of F5 Networks (FFIV) shows how internet companies continue to shake up the market for data-center infrastructure.Deutsche Bank downgraded F5 Networks to sell on Wednesday on views that Amazon.com (AMZN) and others are phasing out outside hardware suppliers as they use internal software to customize and control computer servers and, increasingly, other data-center infrastructure.The biggest cloud-computing service providers — Amazon Web Services, the fast-growing cloud-computing arm of Amazon; Microsoft (MSFT); and Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google operations — have pioneered open-source software concepts in data centers. They've lowered costs by running software on so-called ""white box"" servers and switches, often built by lesser-known suppliers.F5 Networks is the leading maker of application delivery controllers — electronic boxes that direct data traffic to computer servers.""Cloud load balancers from AWS, Microsoft and Google are likely to meaningfully improve in price/performance in 2017 vs. F5 Networks,"" said Vijay Bhagavath, the Deutsche Bank analyst who downgraded F5. For Intel (INTC), there's potential upside as Asian makers of white-box servers use its Skylake chips.Barclays, in a report on March 22, said there was ""bad news"" for ADC suppliers such as F5 Networks in a market-share report by research firm Gartner. The report showed that Amazon has ""expanded its homegrown ADC share, primarily at the expense of Citrix Systems (CTXS), F5 and Radware,"" said Barclays.IBD'S TAKE: Amazon stock rose 2.1% in the stock market today to a new all-time high of 874.32. Amazon is still in a buy range of clearing a buy point of 843.94. F5 Networks stock had neared a buy point of 148.44 before sliding 3.4% on Wednesday to 142.10.

56,CTXS,"Riding just one growth stock to big gains is always a challenge. But Will Danoff does it so often that Fidelity Contrafund has become a $107 billion behemoth that's returned an average annual 12.94% during his more than 27 years at the  helm.That puts Danoff's performance in the top 4.8% of U.S. diversified stock funds that have been around that long, according to Morningstar Inc. His mastery of the stock market (the S&P 500 trails Contrafund with an average annual 10.17%) has attracted a mountain of investor assets, making Contra Fidelity's largest actively managed fund and the third-largest actively run industrywide.And Danoff and Contra are at it again this year, proving once again that a big fund can outmaneuver more-nimble smaller funds. The fund's 9.61% gain through March 3 topped the S&P 500 as well as his peer's average.In a recent conversation with IBD, Danoff, 56, talked about the science of investing, lessons to be learned from the New England Patriots Super Bowl champs and investment opportunities he sees in the Trump era.  And, oh yeah, Danoff went over what he likes about several of his recent top holdings, including Broadcom (AVGO), Netflix (NFLX) and Amazon (AMZN).IBD: You're a Boston guy, Will. What did you think about the Super Bowl?Danoff: For me, sports is a lot like business. You know, how to build a team. How to find all-stars, who can put the ball in the end zone. There was a lot of psychology at work in that game. And it showed the importance of preparation.What the Patriots taught us is to keep looking forward. They don't dwell on their mistakes. And they made a fair number of mistakes in that game. (They were trailing 28-3 in the final minutes of the third quarter.) The lesson for investors is, they stayed focused on their goals.IBD: How is a game like investing in stocks?Danoff: The stock market is a very emotional beast. You get knocked over. But the important thing is to stand back up. Over and over, you try to do better. And the opportunities come. You just have to prepare for them.IBD: Will, for people who may not be familiar with the fund and are confused by its name — does it invest in weird stocks?Danoff: No, Contrafund is a capital appreciation fund with a growth bias. I think over time stock prices follow earnings per share. If a company can double its earnings over the next five years, most likely the stock will double its share price, plus or minus a little.IBD: Summarize what you look for in stocks.Danoff: I'm looking for companies that are well-positioned in their industry, run by experienced management teams who are enthusiastic about what they do, are honorable people who accept that industry as cyclical, so they make prudent capital allocation decisions.I've also found that investing with management that has a large ownership stake and therefore are on the same side of the table as shareholders is a good thing to do.IBD: How has experience made you fine-tune your investment approach?Danoff: I've seen over and over, you have to be careful. I have over time become more disciplined and sensitive to what I'm paying for earnings growth.There's no reward for degree of difficulty in investing. You don't have to be the first investor to find a good story. You can be cautious. If a stock has already doubled or tripled, it doesn't mean you've missed it. If it's going to double or triple again, it's probably still a buy. It's like sports matches. Who cares what happened on the last point scored? You're playing this point now.IBD: Let's talk stocks. In each case, I'm asking about your thesis as of your latest disclosure. HealthEquity (HQY) (which is up 7% so far this year) runs platforms where consumers can access tax-advantaged health care savings and check treatment options. You opened your stake in November and boosted it in December. Why the interest?Danoff: Influenced by (IBD founder) Bill O'Neil and others, I've been intrigued by opportunities in new companies to the market. Fidelity created a new global fund (Fidelity Insights Class) for Canadian investors, launched in the past few weeks, that let's me cast a wider net for small- and midcap companies.IBD: So you learned about HealthEquity while doing research for the Canadian fund?Danoff: Right. I asked analysts on that fund to bring small and midcap ideas because the new fund allows me to take smaller positions. HealthEquity is a provider of health savings accounts (HSAs), which is a growing sector in human resources. Companies that are growing 40% a year are attractive. The whole health care system is moving toward more consumer participation, which can help control health care costs. People went to a doctor, only paid a $5 or $10 copay, so they didn't hesitate to ask about every little ache. That's financially unsustainable. HSAs are part of the solution.IBD: Your long-term outperformance is notable, but 2016 was an off year. What are you expecting for this year?Danoff: Active management had a horrible year last year. But with the new administration and a cyclical orientation in the global economy and especially the U.S. economy, I think active management is going to do very well in the foreseeable future.Fundamentals will matter a lot more. The kind of research we do at Fidelity is going to matter a lot more. REITs, utilities, consumer staples are low growth and now relatively highly valued. Interest rates going up are going to create an OK tail wind for active fund managers.IBD: So you expect 2017 to be better for Contrafund?Danoff: Low interest rates, political uncertainty and decelerating growth in emerging markets propelled big, 'safe' groups to unsustainably high valuations (in 2016). These included integrated oil companies, telecommunications companies, utilities, REITs (real estate investment trusts) and consumer staples. These groups, which represented about a quarter of the S&P 500 the past year, could fall if interest rates continue to climb.The election of Donald Trump was a significant regime change and the new administration is expected to pursue pro-growth policies. I believe rates will rise this year, and that stock selection and earnings growth will play a much bigger role in stock performance in 2017.I believe that stocks follow earnings over time, so better companies that can grow earnings faster will do better than the rest of the market. I am confident that, with the help of Fidelity's global research team, I can find what I consider the best investments for the fund.IBD: What's your biggest take-away from the elections?Danoff: The election of Trump has changed the direction of fiscal policy. He'll pursue a more deregulatory agenda. He'll emphasize U.S. manufacturing. So I'm going to take a more pro-cyclical tilt, which will mean finding some growth cyclicals. Interest rates will continue to back up. What group will benefit from that? I'll be adding to my already heavy bet on financials.IBD: You've got 13 stocks that are on the IBD 50 list, which are leading growth stocks showing strong relative price strength and top-notch fundamentals.Danoff: It's just a coincidence. But let's face it. I'm paid to beat the market. I have to have stocks that are beating the market.IBD: Broadcom's earnings per share growth has accelerated. What's your thesis? (Shares are up 24% this year.)Danoff: Their management has done an excellent job acquiring smaller semiconductor companies and cutting costs, emphasizing the higher-margin, more differentiated products in the acquisitions. They generate a lot of free cash flow, which enables them to make more acquisitions.CEO Tan Hock has done an excellent job focusing on R&D. A stronger economy should be good for semiconductors. (Analysts') earnings estimates are increasing.IBD: Netflix's EPS growth has accelerated for three straight quarters after six quarters of declines. What's your view? (Shares are up 12% this year.)Danoff: CEO Reed Hastings from the beginning had a vision of how consumers don't want linear TV, they want shows when they want them. And he's done a great job of acquiring other people's content and now creating his own exclusive content. He's offering outstanding quality TV at a very reasonable price and in an easy-to-use format. That formula still has legs.IBD: How so?Danoff: He's finding that people in Brazil and Germany want to watch the same types of programs as people do in the U.S. So as he grows members overseas, he can leverage content costs. His pole position in internet TV and the franchise he's built justify Netflix's high valuation.IBD'S TAKE: Netflix is ranked No. 1 in IBD's Leisure-Movies & Related industry group. Check-out the stock's growth metrics in the easy-to-understand fundamental and technical data roundup at IBD's Stock Checkup.IBD: Amazon's quarterly EPS deceleration has been sharp. Are you concerned? (Shares are up 13% this year.)Danoff: I think the earnings slowdown is partly optics. To me, the innovation with Alexa (Amazon's interactive personal assistant) has been powerful. Amazon Web Services grew only 47% last quarter, but that's a $14 billion (annual) run rate. That's nicely profitable.Prime is a great service. It's gaining a lot of market share.Amazon has issues, but they're on them and I like how management has navigated and continued to grow. For a company to be innovating at $130 billion of revenue is really special. I wouldn't want to bet against them. How many $380-billion-market-cap companies grow 20% a year? And generate a lot of free cash flow? Yes, the stock bounces around. Given the high price-earnings ratio (around 170), maybe the stock will be volatile.IBD: You opened your current stake in Nvidia (NVDA) last March. You increased your stake nine-fold in July. What do you like there? (Shares are down 10% so far this year.)Danoff: They're the leader in GPU and graphics chips, which historically have been used in gaming, PC gaming, which has continued to grow. But in the last couple of years, companies that operate servers realized that strings of GPUs (graphics processing units) can power their computer needs more efficiently than regular CPUs, so now Nvidia's GPUs are being used in high performance data centers like Amazon Web Services' and the big social clouds like Facebook's and Microsoft's Azure (which is an enterprise-grade cloud computing program). So Nvidia has additional growth there.A third area of growth is in machine learning and in applications like IBM Watson and driverless cars, where computers need to process a tremendous amount of data quickly.The data-center and autonomous driving markets are growing fast. Nvidia is in the pole position. Their revenues are accelerating, their margins improving.IBD: Your current stake in Citizens Financial (CFG) began in December. Why did you start buying? (Shares are up 8% this year.)Danoff: Citizens is a much smaller position bought as part of a basket of banks. I can take my time seeing which I want to keep.IBD: You began your Applied Materials (AMAT) stake in May and increased your stake in June, July, November and December. What has your thesis been? (Shares are up 14% this year.)Danoff: Semiconductor stocks' performance is tied to an improving economy. And as semiconductor companies do well, they buy more of the semiconductor cap equipment that Applied Materials has.Applied is a leader in OLED technology — organic light emitting diode technology. In the past six months, we've seen orders in that subsector explode. Some people say OLED will only be used in premium smartphones. My bet is that the price will fall enough to expand OLED penetration to the midtier.IBD: What prompted you to trim your LogMeIn (LOGM) stake in November and December? (Shares are up 1% this year.)Danoff: They did a nice deal with Citrix (CTXS). Their videoconference business merged with Citrix in a tax efficient way. It will slow their growth, but it gives them a strong competitive position.It shows the importance of management thinking like owners. You can't predict the future, but you can say you trust management that you've been watching for three or four years. It's like hiring a veteran in football. You know he'll make tackles, won't drop passes. You try to fill your roster with folks you have confidence in.With LogMeIn management did a good deal and the story got better.IBD: You've been running Contrafund a long time. How do you avoid going stale?Danoff: One of the strengths of Fidelity is that we have a small army of young analysts, who haven't been beaten up by time. I like our mix of experience as well as young and enthusiastic analysts. You need youth to be current with what's happening in technology.RELATED:How Fidelity Contrafund Manager Will Danoff Played The DownturnWill Danoff Plus John Roth Equal Top-Performing Fidelity New Insights Fund

62,CTXS,"Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Cisco Systems (CSCO) and other technology companies could gain from President-elect Donald Trump's support of a one-time repatriation of U.S. companies' corporate profits held overseas — if the idea gets enacted by a still-Republican-held Congress.Trump has proposed a 10% repatriation tax on profits of U.S. corporate foreign subsidiaries, down from the statutory 35%. The top five overseas cash holders are Apple, Microsoft, Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL), Cisco and Oracle (ORCL).Trump's cash repatriation proposal ""could bring a flood of money back into the U.S. that would be available for dividends, share buybacks and possibly for capital investments,"" said Kevin Logan, an HSBC economist, in a research report. ""The tax revenue raised could be used to fund an infrastructure spending program, something that was advocated by both candidates during the presidential campaign.""Moody's Investor Service says Apple is on track to have $230 billion in overseas cash by the end of 2016, followed by Microsoft at $113 billion, Cisco at $62 billion, Oracle at $52 billion and Google at $49 billion. It projects that the top five will have $505 billion overseas by year-end, or 86% of their total cash, up from $441 billion in 2015.""We expect most companies would take advantage of a hypothetical tax reduction on permanently repatriated moneys to the maximum extent possible, but the devil is always in the details,"" Moody's analyst Richard Lane told IBD via email. "" Nevertheless, a hypothetical 10% tax on the $1.3 trillion offshore that we project for 2016 translates into $130 billion in tax revenue that could be invested in efficiency enhancing, domestic infrastructure investments.""More important than temporary, one-time tax relief, however, would be permanent tax reform that provides companies clarity to make long-term capital allocation decisions.""Trump has also proposed reducing the U.S. corporate tax rate to 15%, down from 35%, in an effort to keep companies from leaving for countries with lower rates.""Given the Republican control, there is a possibility of some tax relief to incent companies to bring foreign cash back to the U.S. offering an opportunity for them to invest, buyback stock and acquire assets,"" Abhey Lamba, a Mizuho Securities analyst, said in a report.Walter Pritchard, a Citigroup analyst, says a Republican-controlled House and U.S. Senate ""is not likely to block"" the 10% cash repatriation proposal. Republicans kept a narrow lead in the Senate and maintained a solid advantage in the House.Pritchard says Adobe Systems (ADBE), Autodesk (ADSK), Citrix Systems (CTXS), Red Hat (RHT) and VMware (VMW) are among companies that could bring back cash.""We believe the chances increase of a larger share repurchase or (lesser chance) dividend from these companies,"" Pritchard said in a research report.The biotechs with sizable overseas holdings include Amgen (AMGN), Medtronic (MDT) and Gilead Sciences (GILD), says a UBS research report. It says other companies with lots of overseas cash include Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Coca-Cola (KO).""While the specifics would depend on the ultimate legislation, we would expect that a significant amount of the overseas cash balances (perhaps 75% or greater) would be repatriated and used to continue to repurchase shares and pay dividends, but also to increase the pace of M&A and growth capex, of which the latter has been a missing component in the current cycle,"" UBS analyst Julian Emanuel said in the report.Among big tech stocks, Oracle was up 1.1% to 39.55 and Cisco added 1.2% to 31.36 at the close on the stock market today.

63,CTXS,"In a reversal of the far more typical pattern, analysts had a more cautious take on a tech company's earnings report than did investors, and early stock gains for the company in question, Citrix Systems (CTXS), were moderating by midday Thursday.Late Wednesday, the cloud software vendor posted a Q3 beat and raised its guidance for the year. Shares rose after hours and as much as 4.1% right at the open in the stock market today. But at the close, those gains had been whittled down to just 4 cents. At the close, Citrix stock stood at 86.34. The early rise briefly had Citrix stock hitting a possible buy point of 89.60 out of a flat base, but shares quickly fell.IBD'S TAKE: What stocks are being bought or sold heavily by institutional investors, the big boys who can move stocks? That is a fast-changing metric, but you can stay up to date by following IBD's Stocks on the Move. At the time of this writing, Citrix and Netflix were among the six stocks on the ""Up"" list.UBS analyst Brent Thill maintained his sell rating on Citrix, which he says continues to lag VMware (VMW) in the virtualization software market. In a research note Thursday, he noted that Citrix posted flat product licensing revenue vs. Q3 2015, ending a four-quarter growth streak.""We continue to have questions around how much margin upside remains before increased levels of investment are needed to help drive growth back into the core business,"" Thill wrote.Citrix last November announced it would spin off its GoTo family of online collaboration and communication products into a separate company, pushed by activist investor Elliott Management. In July, the company announced that the business would merge with collaboration software maker LogMeIn (LOGM). The spinoff is on track to happen in Q1 2017.Thill and William Blair analyst Jason Ader, who maintained a market perform rating on Citrix stock, both liked the company's momentum and what Ader called ""solid joint wins"" in its partnership with Microsoft (MSFT). Citrix is leveraging Microsoft's Azure cloud services with its desktop virtualization software, looking to give customers more computing flexibility at lower costs.""Overall, we are encouraged by the results of the restructuring effort, the rebound in the core business, and the margin expansion story,"" Ader said in a research report. ""At the same time, we are concerned that the migration of an increasing number of applications to off-premises (cloud), SaaS-based models creates more structural headwinds than tailwinds to the business.""Needham analyst Scott Zeller kept a buy rating on Citrix stock, saying its core (non-GoTo) business outperformed in Q3, but he said in a research note that the company's 2017 guidance ""may have been mixed, in that it only guided for 'core' CTXS.""RELATED:LogMeIn Price-Target Hiked On 'GoTo' Synergies

64,CTXS,"LogMeIn's (LOGM) reverse-merger with the GoToMeeting business of Citrix (CTXS), expected to close in early 2017, will produce marketing and operating synergies, says Needham & Co., which hiked its price target on LogMeIn stock.Needham analyst Scott Zeller raised the price target to 114 from 98.IBD'S TAKE: Citrix stock has flat-lined since the LogMeIn deal was announced. LogMeIn belongs to the Internet-Network Solutions group, where Gigamon has the highest Composite Rating. Gigamon is No. 3 in the IBD 50 list of growth stocks, behind NetEase and Ubiquiti Networks. LogMeIn rose 0.1% to 89.61 in the stock market today. Shares broke out of a flat base at an 86.10 buy point on Sept. 1, so remain within buy range, though investors are urged to be cautious in this volatile market. LogMeIn stock jumped 20% in July on the GoTo deal and is up 33% for the year.LogMeIn and the Citrix unit agreed to merge in late July. Both companies provide technology applications for the workplace, including remote login, help desk remote control, and collaboration software. Citrix's GoTo software targets large companies, where LogMeIn has focused on medium-sized firms.""We believe ""newco"" will seek efficiencies in operating expenses as well as having a common platform (LogMeIn's Gravity) in order to drive free cash flow,"" said Zeller in a research report Friday.Citrix shareholders will end up owning 50.1% of the combined company, and LogMeIn shareholders will own the rest. LogMeIn CEO Bill Wagner will run the company, and its board will be comprised of five directors from LogMeIn and four appointed by Citrix""Another potential surprise may be the ""big data"" analysis capabilities LogMeIn uses on its individual customers to track behavior. If applied constructively to GoTo, there is a chance our 8% revenue growth is conservative,"" added Zeller.RELATED:Gigamon Upgraded As Pioneer And Share-Taker, As Cisco LoomsNetEase Has New Hit Mobile Game In 'Yin And Yang Shi'Citrix Downgraded; 'Likely Buyback Will Do Little to Increase Value'

""This is now the 18th straight quarter of 20%-ish year-over-year revenue growth, and did we mention acceleration?"" he said in a report.Alphabet stock rose 4.2% to 791.34, closing just above a 791.05 entry point after rising as high as 803.94.Ford Motor sent a signal that the long auto industry bull market is over, as U.S. auto sales stall, and higher incentives hit profit margins. The No. 2 U.S. automaker's Q2 earnings per share and revenue rose, but EPS growth was weakest in five quarters, sales growth was the slimmest in three quarters, and Ford cited ""downside risk to global growth."" Offering further evidence of slowing, auto parts maker Lear (LEA) missed on sales and warned on 2016 revenue, while Gentherm (THRM) earnings missed. Volkswagen (VLKAY) Q2 sales edged up 1.7%, but its net profit plunged 57% vs. a year early as it struggled to recover from an emissions test cheating scandal involving diesel-engine models.Ford stock fell 8.5%.The Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged after its two-day policy meeting, as expected. Policymakers said ""near-term economic risks ... have diminished,"" suggesting a baby step to raising rates, and some analysts said it opened the door, slightly, to a September rate increase. But after the Fed meeting and weak GDP data, investors pushed back their expectations for the next hike beyond the next 12 months.The U.S. economy rose at a 1.2% annual rate in Q2, less than half of what Wall Street expected, after Q1's downwardly revised 0.8% pace. Consumer spending was very strong, climbing 4.2%.But residential investment fell, even as separate reports show new- and existing-home sales hitting multiyear highs. Business investment contracted for a third straight quarter. With oil prices falling back toward $40 a barrel, corporate spending may remain weak going forward.U.S. crude oil futures tumbled 5.9% to $41.60 a barrel, hitting three-month lows as the crude tumbled 13.9% for July. U.S. crude and gasoline supplies rose again, according to the Energy Information Administration, which also reported higher U.S. production. The number of U.S. oil rigs in operation rose for a fifth straight week, suggesting further production gains. But a glut of gasoline and refined products, suggesting less refinery demand for crude ahead. Meanwhile, Exxon Mobil (XOM), Chevron (CVX) and ConocoPhillips (COP) reported weaker-than-expected results.Mobileye (MBLY) reported Q2 EPS jumped 70% to 17 cents, while revenue grew 51% to $83.5 million. Both topped views. The maker of driver-assistance systems said that its relationship with Tesla Motors (TSLA) is ending. That news sent Mobileye down 8% on Tuesday, but the stock pared losses for the week to 3.4%. Tesla rose 5.6%.Boeing (BA) reported its first quarterly loss in years due to various charges, but it wasn't as deep as feared. Free cash flow was better than expected on big jet deliveries. Northrop Grumman (NOC) reported modest earnings and sales growth that topped views, but weaker tech services revenue hurt margins. Raytheon (RTN) beat views and raised profit guidance. General Dynamics (GD) topped on earnings and raised EPS guidance, but Q2 revenue missed.McDonald's earned $1.45 a share, beating analysts' expectations for $1.38. Total revenue fell 3.6% vs. a year earlier to $6.265 billion. Analysts had expected $6.27 billion. Global same-store sales, excluding currency effects, rose 3.1% vs. estimates for about 3.6%. U.S. same-store sales rose just 1.8%. Management said they were ""not immune"" to consumer unease -- be it over finances, the election or, in general, ""an unsettled world"" -- that may have hurt other restaurants during the quarter.Shares fell 8.3% to 117.60 for the week, tumbling through their 50-day and 200-day moving averages -- and a 124.18 buy point.Stifel Nicolaus downgraded a large number of restaurant stocks, while Jefferies predicted a U.S. recession would hit the sector. Top-rated Texas Roadhouse (TXRH), which reports earnings in the coming week, fell 6% on Wednesday. But the steakhouse chain found support at its 50-day line and closed the week down 2.3%.United Technologies (UTX), maker of Pratt & Whitney brand aircraft engines, Otis elevators and other products, reported second-quarter earnings per share and revenue that beat estimates and raised its Q3 EPS estimate. Its stock hit a one-year high at 108.49, above a 107.07 buy point. Caterpillar's (CAT) Q2 EPS and revenue both fell as the mining and construction equipment giant deals with an energy and mining downturn. Its stock hit a roughly one-year high at 84.29, rising above an 80.89 entry point. Chemicals giant DuPont (DD), which is merging with Dow Chemical (DOW), crushed earnings estimates but was light on revenue. Shares rose to 69.87, the highest point since mid-December, triggering its 69.50 buy point. Meanwhile 3M (MMM), which makes tapes, adhesives, medical supplies and other products, also reported higher EPS and lower revenue, beating estimates on both. But its shares fell 1.1%.Analog Devices (ADI) agreed to buy Linear Technology (LLTC) in a cash-and-stock deal worth around $14.8 billion to create a microchip-industry giant. The deal is expected to close within the first half of 2017. Meanwhile, Oracle (ORCL) said it would buy cloud-services provider NetSuite (N) in a $9.3 billion deal. Oracle's Larry Ellison is the leading shareholder of NetSuite. Meanwhile, Citrix Systems (CTXS) will merge its Go To Meeting unit with LogMeIn (LOGM). Citrix was already planning to spin off Go To Meeting.Verizon Communications acquired struggling the core assets of Yahoo for nearly $6 billion, including $1.1 billion in stock compensation costs. ""Despite the massive execution challenges ahead, the Yahoo acquisition demonstrates that Verizon recognizes its own limitations as a consumer brand,"" said research firm The Diffusion Group. Verizon reported Q2 revenue that missed views and in-line EPS, and added fewer wireless postpaid phone subscribers than expected.T-Mobile US (TMUS) in Q2 added 646,000 postpaid phone subscribers, topping Sprint (S) at 173,000 and Verizon's 86,000. AT&T (T) lost 160,000 postpaid phone subscribers. T-Mobile's earnings fell 40% but still beat expectations. Revenue rose nearly 13% to $9.2 billion. ""TMUS revenue growth continues to significantly outpace peers,"" said Matthew Niknam, a Deutsche Bank analyst, in a report.Under Armour (UA) met top-line and bottom-line expectations when it reported per-share earnings of a penny, down 75% from the prior-year Q2, and 28% revenue growth to $1 billion. The Nike (NKE) rival announced several assertive plans, including its takeover of the FAO Schwarz space in Manhattan, as well as a partnership with Kohl's (KSS). But shares tumbled 7.9% for the week.Amgen (AMGN) beat and raised, but its stock slipped as its growth continued to be driven by price increases rather than volume. Celgene (CELG), meanwhile, jumped as only a third of its growth was price-driven, making up for a hit earlier in the week when its drug Revlimid failed a lymphoma trial. AbbVie (ABBV), Merck (MRK) and Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) also rose on solid reports. AstraZeneca (AZN) was the biggest winner stock-wise when it jumped 9% Thursday on rumors that Swiss pharma Novartis (NVS) was thinking of acquiring it. The biggest loser was Gilead Sciences (GILD), which trimmed its guidance as its hepatitis C franchise continued to decline.Meanwhile, top-rated medical device companies Edwards Lifesciences (EW) and orthopedics giant Zimmer Biomet (ZBH) each hit new highs after beating estimates and raising guidance. Big Cap 20 stalwart Boston Scientific (BSX) hit a 10-year high after it reported its strongest quarter of sales growth in nearly a decade.

Action in the NYSE indexes was quieter, but the new-high list once again showed nice breadth. Leaderboard name Edwards Lifesciences (EW) jumped 6.09 to 114.44. Late Tuesday, the heart-valve maker reported a strong second quarter beat and raised its third-quarter and full-year guidance. Edwards is…
"
75,CTXS,"Jerry Dodson's Parnassus Endeavor Fund (PARWX) proves that you can have your socially responsible cake and eat it too.The $1.5 billion mutual fund favors companies that provide employees with ""outstanding workplaces."" So do the five other funds at Parnassus Investments, which Dodson founded in 1984. That includes things like offering workers profit-sharing, time off for working parents, paid time off for volunteer work, fair treatment and clear communication.The investment team at Parnassus, which has $16.5 billion under management, also screen out companies engaged in the extraction, exploration, production, manufacturing or refining of fossil fuels.None of those criteria have prevented Endeavor from outperforming its peers or the broad market in the past 10 years.It is the top-performing environmental, social and corporate-governance (ESG) fund over the 10 years ended June 30, with an 11.57% average annual return in that decade, says Morningstar Inc. The S&P 500 averaged a 7.42% yearly gain in that span.The fund also ranks in the top 1% of all large-cap growth mutual funds in that period and the top 2% over the past five years.And it is an IBD Best Mutual Funds 2016 Awards winner, glowing in three categories — U.S. equity funds, growth funds and large caps. It outperformed the S&P 500 over the one-, three-, five- and 10-year periods ended Dec. 31.Through Q2, it was ahead of roughly 42% of all U.S. diversified stock funds so far this year.Dodson's affinity for ESG investing has deep roots. He founded Parnassus Investments at the age of 41 with those goals in mind. Earlier work was a harbinger of what was to come: A political science major as UC Berkeley, he got his MBA from Harvard Business School in 1971, then went on to work for a nonprofit outfit that helped minority-owned businesses. He helped organize Continental Savings of America, becoming the president and CEO of the S&L, which developed an innovative product for depositors to invest in solar energy projects.Dodson is lead manager on Parnassus Fund (PARNX) and Parnassus Asia Fund (PAFSX) and sole manager of Endeavor. From his office in San Francisco, 73-year-old Dodson talked with Investor's Business Daily about the ins and outs of his investment approach and how he began to use social screens.IBD: You're juggling two tough tasks: You not only use ESG criteria, you also run a concentrated portfolio. Which is tougher?Dodson: You know, the hard part was getting the philosophy and tweaking it with simulations, which was done over many years. Once we understood the strategy would work, the size of the portfolio just followed.You'll be surprised that we took advice from a journalist (about the size and strategy). I was social friends with Milton Moskowitz, who was writing a news story that started as a book. It was about the 100 best places to work.I looked at the returns of the 50% to 60% that were publicly traded ... and thought I should start a fund based on that. Milton thought I should stick with 100 companies. I disagreed. He said I'd screw it up.Anyway, it took years (of looking for fundamental metrics that correlated to good stock performance). It took about two years of back-testing on paper, then five more years of running the portfolio (before opening it to the public).IBD: Aside from ESG criteria, it looks to me as if you seek large-cap companies with wide moats or strong competitive advantages, and quality management teams that act in the best interests of shareholders. Have I got it right?Dodson: That's it, succinctly.IBD: Information technology is your largest sector, with a 50% weighting as of March 31. Is that a typical exposure to tech?Dodson: It's usually been our largest sector, but not 50%. Normally it's around 30%. The reason is that we know the sector well. Silicon Valley is down the road from us and more and more right here in the city.Also, in terms of workplace, technology companies seem a step ahead in providing a good environment. Google -- Alphabet (GOOGL) now -- has generous maternity leave, a gym where you can work out, days off for doing charitable events.Compared to, say, the steel industry, workplace issues score stronger at tech companies.IBD: Speaking of Alphabet, it's been trending sideways since late April. Do you still like the stock?Dodson: We started buying at 525 in December 2014. Now it's up to (the low 700s). We think it will make more gains. But you're right, it's been pretty flat. We regard it as a long-term holding. It's got a great moat and a good social story.IBD: Why do you think it has more room to run?Dodson: Primarily because of its moat, and it's looking to develop new products. It has a huge cash stake, a talented workforce. Its search engine gives them (revenue and earnings) stability. I don't know what new ideas they're working on, but I know they're looking for new products and they'll find something.IBD: In general, you emphasize some ESG criteria more than others, right?Dodson: We are more focused on the workplace, how a company treats employees. Then the environment. Workplace is a component of ""social.""IBD: How is workplace part of ""social""?Dodson: The word ""social"" covers a lot. For us, it means how a company treats its employees. It can mean safety record, privacy policy, relationship to the community where the company operates, diversity programs and good, clear, honest communication.IBD: Do you ever invest in a stock because its E, S or G features are very attractive, even though its financial performance is not so bright?Dodson: In the past we've done that. I did it before Endeavor Fund, with Parnassus Fund (PARNX). The stock was Control Data (a supercomputer company). They would hire former prisoners, do great social things. But the business strategy was just OK. We invested, and it was one of the worst mistakes I ever had. It cured me of picking for environmental or social reasons alone.IBD: Let's talk about individual holdings as of your latest disclosure. Citrix Systems' (CTXS) earnings per share rose 51% and 82% the past two quarters. A lot of people think the enterprise software developer, specializing in desktop virtualization, lost its focus. It's in a reorganization that has involved layoffs of staff and contractors. How does this situation look to you?Dodson: The reason we invested was because of their GoToMeeting app (which is being spun off). GoToMeeting is similar to Citrix's XenApp. You can be thousands of miles away from your server, doing applications, and you can use it on your smartphone or laptop, and it delivers it safely on your mobile device. That's what makes them successful. People want applications, this company delivers them where you want.IBD: Your stake in Applied Materials' (AMAT) is up. Are you satisfied with their progress?Dodson: It was in the doldrums when we initiated a position in May 2009 at 11.22. Equipment used to make semiconductors tends to be volatile. Sales and earnings are very cyclical. We tried to buy at a time when the stock had fallen off, then ride it up. Now it's (rising). We believe Applied will benefit from significant order growth with its leading etch and deposition tools.IBD: Ciena's (CIEN) earnings per share have slowed from 625% growth three quarters ago to 50% growth and a 3% decline the past two frames. Everything OK there?Dodson: We've owned it quite a while. It's more volatile than we expected. It makes communication glass wires, equipment that moves impulses, whether they are voice or data, along transmission lines. Earnings have been lumpy because any time you have an equipment maker, it has ups and downs. We've held it through cycles. It's more volatile than we expected. But we like the company, and we think it has more upside.IBD: Why do you own C.H. Robinson Worldwide (CHRW)? It's not a tech story. And revenue has declined three quarters in a row.Dodson: It's a freight forwarder, focusing on trucking. You're right. It hasn't done well. That's primarily because shipping has not picked up as much as anticipated. The economy is growing (at an annualized rate of) 2% or less. To get trucking and freight forwarding growing, the economy has to grow more. So it's a play that the economic recovery will accelerate. But our average cost is 55. The stock is in the mid-70s, so we've done well.IBD: Charles Schwab's (SCHW) EPS grow has accelerated for two quarters, but share price has been weak. What's your play here?Dodson: We're tied in to them. We pay Schwab if customers come in through them.But the key? A lot of brokerage firms, including Schwab, collect interest on margin loans. With interest rates so low, they don't make much. But if interest rates increase, then there's a huge earnings increase for Schwab. It's in the mid-20s now. It would go to the 40s.If our economy gets better, rates will go up and Schwab will take off.IBD: Intel's (INTC) EPS growth is speeding up. Where's the growth for their computer chips coming from?Dodson: They make chips for personal computers, smartphones and other applications. They also make chips for servers. Those sales are going up.They've been trying for years to get into the mobile (devices) market. They finally have semiconductors going into the iPhone. They're trying to get more into communications and other growth areas. With this Apple (AAPL) chip and other missions, that's what we're banking on to move Intel higher.IBD: Procter & Gamble (PG) is the classic defensive stock. But revenue per share has declined for eight quarters. Is this what you want?Dodson: You're right about revenue declining. They've got these amazing brands: Crest, Tide, Gillette, Head & Shoulders. But they need a new growth engine. We're looking at it. Does it have growth ahead? We haven't reached a conclusion.IBD: IBM (IBM) EPS is down four straight quarters. Sales are down 16 frames in a row. Why invest in it?
"
76,CTXS,"Dodson: My only defense is that Warren Buffett owns a lot more than I do. I first bought it at the end of 2013. I expected it to turn around as they cut emphasis on hardware. At some point, growth in (consulting and) software will offset declines in hardware. But it hasn't happened yet. At 10.7 times (forward) earnings, we believe share price is on the bargain table.IBD: Is Buffett selling?Dodson: No. We look when there's a filing, but we've seen no sign of (Buffett selling). I'm sure he's having the same regrets I have.IBD: W.W. Grainger's (GWW) EPS and sales finally notched gains after declining for two quarters. But shares are not making headway.Dodson: Grainger makes everything under the sun (for maintenance). This in some sense is a play on the overall economy. If the U.S. economy can grow fast enough, Grainger will do well because its products touch almost every sector of the economy.IBD: Gilead Sciences' (GILD) EPS and revenue growth have slowed in recent quarters. Do you still like this stock?Dodson: I was expecting sales to increase quite a bit for their hepatitis C product. But they had to cut prices because of competition. Both AbbVie (ABBV) and Merck (MRK) make therapies for hep C. Gilead is a great lab. They will develop new therapies. In time, the company should do well.IBD: This fund began with a different name. Why the name change, Jerry?Dodson: The way we pick stocks hasn't changed. We started out as the Workplace Fund. We had good performance early on, but the name Workplace Fund was not getting the attention we thought it should.People on our staff said we got strange reactions from brokers and advisors, who weren't sure what the name meant. ""Why not pick a more general name?"" they said. They said that would get more shareholder money, more acceptance.IBD: And why is the fund concentrated?Dodson: Primarily because I can't find enough companies that are undervalued that meet the workplace and social criteria.IBD: The fund has 25 names. How typical is that?Dodson: We would like to have 35 to 40 names. We're looking for more. The last couple years we went down to 25 or so.IBD: The fund had an 11% cash weighting as of May 31. Was that because it's hard to find your kind of stocks?Dodson: That's correct. I try to stay as fully invested as possible.IBD: Jerry, make my day: Before running this fund, did you run a totally non-PC fund -- you know, one that only invests in ammo, tobacco, oil?Dodson: Before Endeavor, I managed each of six (including one that no longer exists) other Parnassus funds prior to finding a manager for each of them. I founded Parnassus Investments in 1984. Prior to that, I worked for six years as president of a small bank in San Francisco. Before that, I spent four years as a foreign service officer with the Department of State, serving in Panama and Vietnam.IBD: What was your investment style before you embraced ESG?Dodson: We've embraced ESG since the firm was founded. It was one of our founding principles.IBD: What got you into ESG?Dodson: My personal philosophy had always revolved around ESG, but I wasn't sure it could be used as a business philosophy. At Continental, I started a program to allow savers to put their money into special savings accounts that would be lent out for solar energy installations. Much to my pleasant surprise, the program was very popular.It convinced me that there was a market out there for investors who wanted to make a positive impact with their money. This led to the founding of Working Assets Money Fund (1983-1984), which took ESG factors into account in investing in money market securities.This, in turn, led to the formation of Parnassus Investments.I took the ESG from my experience, then added the value-oriented philosophy of Benjamin Graham, whose writings I admired. These two strains formed the basis of the Parnassus investment philosophy.IBD: How did you come up with the Parnassus name?Dodson: I lived on a street near Parnassus Avenue in San Francisco. I looked up the mythology around Mount Parnassus in Greece and discovered it was the site of the Oracle of Delphi. I liked the image of the oracle often going against the prevailing wisdom. It fit my contrarian, value-oriented investment philosophy.IBD: Since you're 73, do you have plans to retire?Dodson: I plan to retire as chief executive officer in 2018 at 75. However, I plan to stay on indefinitely as manager of Endeavor until I find someone well-qualified to take over.

Declining production, along with fires in Canada and terrorism in Nigeria, have combined to double the price of crude since February.Among IBD 50 stocks, 37 were higher and 13 were lower. The best performer was Thor Industries (THO), which reported better-than-expected earnings but missed slightly on revenue. It gapped up on big volume for a nearly 6% gain.How Does Thor Industries earnings and revenue growth measure up with other leading stocks?The Dow was helped by advances for its two energy components, Chevron (CVX) and Exxon Mobil (XOM). They rose 2% apiece on the strength of oil prices.But Verizon (VZ) was also a big contributor to the Dow's outperformance, popping by more than 2%. Verizon CFO Fran Shammo said at an industry conference that an acquisition of Yahoo (YHOO) would fit nicely into the company's strategy. It also expects a per-share hit to Q2 earnings of 5 to 7 cents because Verizon's recent labor strike required it to pay managers overtime and hire lots of contractors, while new installations lagged.

86,CTXS,"F5 Networks (FFIV) could be a buyer, not a seller, and might use its sizable cash-on-hand to acquire a data center security  provider, says Pacific Crest Securities.Some analysts have speculated F5 Networks itself could be sold, amid its slowing revenue growth. F5 Network stock has clawed back 7% in 2016 after falling 25% in 2015. But F5 Networks stock was down 1.5%, near 106, in early trading in the stock market today.Brent Bracelin, an analyst at Pacific Crest,  downgraded F5 Networks stock on Tuesday to sector weight.“Going forward, we see an increasing probability that M&A will have a greater role in defining (F5 Network’s) ‘third act,’ particularly given that F5 has excess cash reserves of $1 billion and robust operating cash flows that exceed $600 million annually,"" he wrote in a research report.Seattle-based F5 is the leading maker of application delivery controllers (ADCs) -- electronic boxes that direct data traffic to computer servers. ADCs optimize server workloads in corporate and telecom data centers, helping speed up websites and communication networks.F5 Networks has made some small security-related acquisitions, including Defense.Net, a provider of cloud-based security services that help protect websites from large-scale distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, as well as Israel-based Versafe, a maker of software that protects Web applications from malware, fraud and phishing attacks.F5 Network’s closest rival in application-based data center security is Imperva (IMPV), analysts say.The so-called perimeter firewall market -- the main type of firewall -- is a crowded field, with Check Point Software Technologies (CHKP), Cisco Systems (CSCO) and Palo Alto Networks (PANW) among the vendors.Another concern is that F5’s revenue growth might not rebound in 2016, Bracelin said.“The Shasta appliance refresh cycle will not drive a return to double-digit product growth, at least not for any quarter this year, and that there is increasing execution risk with a higher probability of M&A within cloud security,” he added.F5 competes with Citrix Systems (CTXS), as well as Radware (RDWR) and A10 Networks (ATEN).

88,CTXS,"After Citrix Systems (CTXS) beat Wall Street's Q1 forecast -- and raised its full-year outlook -- investors sent Citrix stock flying as much 12% higher Thursday to 90, a 16-year high.RBC Capital and Needham analysts hiked their price targets, though neither upgraded their ratings.Citrix stock eased but was still up nearly 5%, near 84, in early afternoon trading in the stock market today.After Wednesday's close, the enterprise software developer, specializing in desktop virtualization, said Q1 adjusted earnings rose 81% to $1.18 per share, where analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected 92 cents. Revenue rose 8.5% to $826 million, well beyond analysts' $789 million consensus.With its 93 IBD Composite Rating, Citrix is the highest-ranked issue in IBD's Computer Software-Specialty Enterprise industry group. Shares of the largest company in the group by market value, VMware (VMW), were down a fraction. Thursday morning, Citrix and CA (CA) traded places, with Citrix now No. 2, with a $12.9 billion market cap, vs. CA's $12.8 billion. CA stock was up more than 1% Thursday afternoon.Analysts Thursday were impressed with gains so early in Citrix' reorganization process that included laying off 1,000 employees and contractors in December and January. But they're waiting for Citrix to fully execute, most significantly waiting for Citrix to spin off its GoToMeeting line into a freestanding, publicly traded company before year-end.""The ongoing restructuring at CTXS ... (including) headcount reductions and product card rationalization, many expected these disruptions to impact top-line growth,"" said Needham analyst Scott Zeller in a Thursday research note.He hiked his price target on Citrix stock to 96 from 90.RBC analyst Matthew Hedberg raised his price target from 80 to 90. He said that Q1 license revenue grew the most in 11 quarters, and total revenue growth was the best in eight.""Another solid quarter, as outperformance has been marked over the last three quarters thanks to the operational initiatives introduced last year and the focus on the core strategy of the secure delivery of apps and data,"" he said in a Thursday research note.Citrix said it may file a Form 10 registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the GoTo spinoff before the end of Q2.

89,CTXS,"Apparently not too distracted by its reorganization, the highest-rated issue in IBD’s Computer Software-Specialty Enterprise industry group, Citrix Systems (CTXS) boosted its Q1 earnings faster than analysts had expected.Reporting after the market close, the maker of cloud management software said Q1 adjusted earnings rose 81% to $1.18 per share, where Wall Street expected 92 cents. Revenue rose 8.5% to $826 million, while analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had modeled $789 million.Citrix stock was up nearly 7% in after-hours trading, following the company's Q1 earnings release. Shares closed up a fraction, at 80.56, in the stock market today, just 4% off a four-year high of 84.17, hit on Oct. 28.""I am very pleased with our performance this quarter on both the top line and bottom line,"" Citrix CEO Kirill Tatarinov said in the company's earnings release. ""The progress we made in refocusing the company -- simplifying our portfolio and sharpening our message -- is starting to pay off.""We are seeing a strong improvement in our operating margin, and our focused strategy has made it easier for our field teams and channel partners to execute; consequently, we saw improvement in the top line. It gives us a measure of confidence that we are on the right path, and it gives us opportunities to solidify our leadership position in our core areas.""Q1 marks Citrix's fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit earnings growth following three quarters of 2%-to-7% growth. Profits have outperformed sales, up by only single-digit percentages, now for seven straight quarters.Last week, Robert W. Baird analyst Steven Ashley reiterated an outperform rating with an 85 price target on Citrix stock. He said Baird had surveyed 96 Citrix channel partners and got back mixed results, “consistent with management’s guidance that factored in normal (Q1) seasonality and allowed for possible disruptions from reorganizational activity.”“We continue to believe prospects for improved channel performance are underappreciated,"" Ashley said.The company's reorganization included the layoff of about 1,000 employees and contractors in December and January, the pending spinoff of Citrix’s GoTo lines and a $200 million annual reduction in other operating expenses. In February, Kevin Parker, former CEO of Deltek, was named chairman of the GoTo spinoff, expected to be completed late this year.The third-largest in IBD’s Computer Software-Specialty Enterprise industry group, Citrix boasts a $12.45 billion market cap, half the size of the largest, VMware (VMW), but barely smaller than CA (CA).However, VMware carries an IBD Composite Rating of 47, compared with CA’s 54 and Citrix’s 92, meaning Citrix is outperforming  92% of all S&P 500 stocks based on earnings, sales, institutional ownership and other fundamental metrics.

90,CTXS,"Stocks reversed from small gains Thursday to close in the red as sellers took control of a session dominated by earnings reports.The Dow Jones industrial average led the downside with a 0.6% loss, the S&P 500 gave up 0.5%, and the Nasdaq edged nearly 0.05% lower. Volume was mixed in the stock market today, slightly higher on the NYSE but lower on the Nasdaq, according to preliminary figures. Losers topped winners by a 5-3 margin on the NYSE; decliners just outpaced advancers on the Nasdaq.The biggest losers included transportation, retail and homebuilder stocks. Oil drillers also lagged, as West Texas intermediate crude slid 2% to $43.26 a barrel. United Continental (UAL) slumped 10% to a two-month low in turbulent trade. The airline on Wednesday reported Q1 earnings and sales that fell 19% and 5%, respectively.On the Dow, Travelers (TRV) gapped down and sank 6%, closing well below its 50-day moving average in heavy turnover. The insurance giant reported Q1 revenue that beat, but earnings that missed consensus estimates.Mellanox (MLNX) gapped down and plunged 12% in massive volume. Shares fell below their 50-day line and undercut a 47.79 buy point of a cup with handle. The chip designer announced Q1 profit and sales that topped views, but its Q2 revenue outlook came in below estimates.Apparel makers and drug stocks outperformed. Among apparel makers, Under Armour (UA) gapped up and leapt 7% to a four-month high, clearing a 34.33 buy point of a cup with handle in fast trade. The sports apparel and athletic shoe maker reported Q1 results that beat forecasts.On the IBD 50, Citrix Systems (CTXS) surged as much as 12% to a 16-year high before easing to close with a 4% gain. The stock cleared an 84.27 buy point in brisk trade, but closed slightly below the entry. RBC Capital and Needham raised their price targets on the software maker, whose Q1 results late Wednesday crushed forecasts.Economic news was mixed. Jobless claims fell for a second week, by more than 2% to 247,000, well below views for 265,000 claims. The Conference Board's leading economic indicators index climbed 0.2% in March, up from a 0.1% dip in February but below projections for a 0.5% increase.
"
91,CTXS,"Stocks reversed their opening gains Thursday and backed into mild losses, as mixed economic news and earnings reports energized busy early trade.The Dow industrials, Nasdaq and S&P 500 dipped 0.3% each. Volume jumped 20% on the NYSE and was up 5% on the Nasdaq, relative to action at the same time Wednesday. Rising volume suggests that funds and other institutional investors are driving a large share of trade.Today's stock market received mixed economic news before the open. Jobless claims declined for a second week, the Labor Department reported, snubbing consensus expectations for an increase and holding close to lows not seen since 1973.At 10 a.m. ET, the Federal Housing Finance Agency reported its February Housing Price Index rose 0.4%, in line with consensus estimates and with the agency's revised figures for January.Leading economic indicators improved in March, the Conference Board reported, putting its Leading Economic Index up 0.2% for the month. That was a turnaround from February's 0.1% decline but far below expectations for a 0.5% increase.Europe's market may have exerted some influence on early action. The European Central Bank left its current economic stimulus program unchanged, which was widely expected by markets. In press conference comments following the announcement, ECB President Mario Draghi said the bank was prepared to use ""all instruments available"" to see that eurozone inflation returns to target levels of just below 2%. ECB estimates in March put 2016 inflation at 0.1%. Europe's markets trimmed some early losses after the conference. Leading benchmarks in Paris and Frankfurt were down less than 0.5%, and London's FTSE 100 was off 0.7%, in afternoon trade.A heavy docket of earnings reports drove a large share of early trade. At the high and low ends of the Dow, American Express (AXP) rose more than 2%, while Verizon (VZ) shed more than 2%, both after reporting Q1 results.Citrix Systems (CTXS) and Under Armour (UA) rose more than 7% each and battled for the best spot on the S&P 500.At the bottom of the index, earnings results sent Alliance Data Systems (ADS) down 7%, and Mattel (MAT) and United Continental Holdings (UAL) 6% lower.Israel-based chipmaker Mellanox Technologies (MLNX) pared losses to 11% after dropping 14% in opening trade. The company announced better-than-expected revenue and adjusted earnings late Wednesday, but management trimmed the Q2 revenue guidance to below the consensus forecasts. The loss sent shares below their 50-day in very heavy trade, and erased the stock's gains above a 47.70 buy point -- tripping two sell signals. The stock recovered to just above that buy marker.Citrix Systems topped the IBD 50 list. Its big-volume, gap-up gain sent shares easily to a new high, leaving it extended 8% above an 80 buy point in a six-month cup with handle. Because of the gap up breakout, aggressive investors could consider the stock in buy range through about 90 -- about 5% above the low end of this morning's gap up move.Also on the IBD 50 list, Pool (POOL) gained more than 1% after a strong, across-the-board first-quarter beat. Management lifted its full-year earnings guidance, reporting that warmer weather led to an early start of this year's pool season. Shares are ticking off new highs, extended almost 9% above an 84.63 buy point in a flat base.Sprouts Farmers Markets (SFM) dropped 5% in heavy trade at the starting bell. The stock has been unable to muster momentum above a 27.95 buy point and is now pulled back for a test of support at its 50-day moving average.

92,CTXS,"Large-cap growth mutual funds outperformed large-cap value funds over the past decade. But they had to overcome a lead that the value-oriented funds initially held for several years.Large-cap growth funds did not take the lead decisively until the third quarter of 2013.Before that, when large-cap value funds outperformed, many of them got a tailwind from investors seeking the relative safe haven of funds holding stocks that paid dividends. Many funds like that are value-oriented.Overall, during the past 10 years large-cap growth funds averaged an annual return of 6.80%, according to Morningstar Inc.Large-cap value funds averaged a 5.39% yearly gain.If you had invested $10,000 on March 31, 2006, in a cross section of large-cap growth funds, after a decade your money would have ballooned into $19,504.The same amount invested in a cross-section of large-cap value funds would have grown to $17,259.That difference would have added a higher octane to your retirement plan's gas tank.In that decade, the now-$1.4 billion Parnassus Endeavor Fund (PARWX) was the best-performing large-cap growth fund with $100 million or more in assets.It racked up an 11.17% average annual gain vs. just 7.17% for the S&P 500.What is it that revs Parnassus Endeavor's engine? Here are some of the keys.Managed by Jerome Dodson throughout that period, the fund had 91% of its shareholders' money at work in U.S. stocks as of March 31, 2016.

94,CTXS,"Well-trained, open-water swimmers learn to alter their techniques in order to deal with rough conditions. This means, among other things, sacrificing some symmetry and efficiency in order to flow with and punch through the chop.Stocks attempting to build bases in difficult markets show similar adaptations. One common result: the base-on-base pattern.From an investor's standpoint, a base-on-base can be an exercise in frustration. A stock forms a base, breaks out, then immediately falls back into a second consolidation. An ideal base-on-base sees the low of the second consolidation just touch the high point of the prior base.In reality, the stacked patterns can seem messy and disorderly.  But they generally are an indicator of a strong stock, struggling to advance against a stubborn market. This is one of the reasons why the M in CAN SLIM stands for market conditions. Stocks fighting a weak market are clearly trying to swim upstream.Rather than showing the typical 20%-plus gain that separates distinct bases, leading stocks in choppy markets may rise only a few percentage points before pulling back. Often, they will form a flat base after a breakout from a cup, and use that as a platform from which to advance.When a base dips well into a prior base, this is generally called a base-beside-a-base pattern. It is still a valid structure, but doesn’t normally carry the firepower of a base-on-base. Facebook (FB) has staged an awkward base-beside-a-base pattern since November, yet is still advancing in price. Universal Display (OLED) and Prestige Brands Holdings (PBH) offer somewhat more tidy examples.In some cases, particularly in consolidating markets, a new base will dive back below the low of the prior base. This decline resets the stock’s base count. The new base is considered a first-stage formation, suggesting that the stock may have additional room to advance. Priceline Group (PCLN) and Citrix Systems (CTXS) demonstrate recent base resets.Constellation Brands (STZ) has traded tightly for a fourth straight week, and the recent price movement rests just at the high of its prior base. If it holds for another week, the pattern becomes a flat base-on-base.Maybe the best recent example comes from Edwards Lifesciences (EW). A leading maker of heart valve replacements, Edwards has stacked up a series of base-on-base and base-next-to-a-base patterns beginning early last year. Its first breakout – from a cup-with-handle base in July 2015 – rose for less than two weeks before turning down into another cup-with-handle (1).Investors would not have wanted to hold through this 21% deep consolidation. But the trick is to keep the stock on a watch list. Those who jumped in at this second breakout, in late October, took a little longer ride, rising about 8% in less than six weeks. Then, another consolidation. Shares corrected 13%, cleared an 80.95 handle buy point in heavy trade Feb. 2 (2), then dropped 6.9% below the pivot -- stopping just short of a sell rule (please see a daily chart at Investors.com). Edwards retook the buy point in a three-day run up in mid-February.The stock rose 11% in two weeks before stalling into a flat consolidation. Unlike the prior consolidations, this pattern dipped only 7% and held comfortably above its 10-week moving average. The breakout this time around was a killer: up 17% in powerful trade on April 4 after positive trial results on its Sapien heart valve.True to character, shares rose another 7% over the next three weeks, then pulled back for what may well become another consolidation. But stay tuned....

105,CTXS,"U.S. diversified large-cap mutual funds have slightly outperformed small-cap funds over the past decade, but have surrendered nearly all of their once-big lead.The lead between the two categories swung back and forth several times. Understanding that seesaw action can help you with future buy and sell decisions in the diversified portion of your portfolio that includes mutual funds and ETFs.And that can boost the octane of your retirement accounts.Overall, large-cap funds averaged a yearly gain of 6.18% between the end of 2005 and March 24, 2016. Small-cap funds averaged a 5.50% annual return, according to Morningstar Inc.Large-caps funds topped small caps in most quarters during the market meltdown from late 2007 through early 2009. Seeking safer ground, investors rotated into large caps, whose larger size and financial heft made them more likely to survive the market downturn.As the recovery picked up pace, small caps often outperformed.But large caps held off the charge by small caps in most of 2014 and again since mid-2015.If you had invested $10,000 in the average large-cap fund on Dec. 31, 2005, by March 24 of this year it would have grown into $19,328. That is just $67 more than the end result for the same amount invested in the average small-cap fund.Over those 10 years plus this year-to-date, $1.4 billion Parnassus Endeavor Fund (PARWX) was the top-performing large-cap portfolio with $100 million or more in assets. The fund racked up an 11.09% average annual gain. Its yearly return over the past three years has been 14.26%.Endeavor is one of the IBD Best Mutual Funds 2016 award winners, and a top-five fund in IBD's large-cap category.The fund had 96% of its money at work in U.S. stocks as of Feb. 29.Fifty-seven percent of manager Jerome Dodson's stocks were giant- and large-cap stocks. Another 36% were midcaps.Technology was by far Dodson's largest sector, with a 51% weighting.Industrials and financial services were Dodson's next two biggest sectors, with 19% and 14% weightings respectively.Citrix Systems (CTXS) is one of Dodson's tech names. The software developer is up 11% from its Feb. 11 closing low. That leaves the stock just below breakeven for the year.As cloud-based Web apps proliferate, customers turn to Citrix for security and management solutions.Earnings per share growth has accelerated for three quarters, growing 2%, 20%, 39% and 51% in the past four stanzas.The stock has IBD's Composite Rating of 93. The Composite Rating combines IBD’s five stock-performance ratings, including EPS and Relative Strength ratings.Applied Materials (AMAT) is another of Parnassus Endeavor's tech holdings. The semiconductor equipment maker is up 8% so far this year.Demand for displays is driving growth for the firm.First-quarter 2016 revenue was $2.3 billion. That was a 4% decline from a year earlier, but better than analysts industrywide had expected. EPS growth was down 4%, but also beat analyst estimates.Applied Materials has an 84 Comp Rating.C.H. Robinson Worldwide (CHRW) is one of the fund's industrials. Shares are up 19% so far this year.The stock has posted seven quarters of double-digit EPS growth after a six-quarter EPS decline streak.Boasting a 90 Comp Rating, Robinson is a third-party logistics firm that provides freight transportation services and logistics solutions.BMO Capital Markets reportedly downgraded Robinson earlier this month stock to ""market perform"" from ""outperform,"" but increased its price target to $74 from $72.

107,CTXS,"Super Tuesday was equally super for the stock market, as stocks ended with big gains in higher volume.Stocks strengthened after the February ISM manufacturing index came in better than expected, at 49.5, even though the index still showed contraction for the fifth straight month. Meanwhile, U.S. consumers’ six-month economic outlook for the nation fell to its lowest level in more than two years, according to a fresh reading from the IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index.The Nasdaq surged 2.9%, the S&P 500 gained 2.4%, and the Dow Jones industrial average rose 2.1% in the stock market today.Winners topped losers on the NYSE by a 5-to-1 margin. The ratio was nearly 3-to-1 on the Nasdaq.Money flowed out of bonds and into stocks, as the 10-year Treasury yield jumped 9 basis points to 1.82%.Ross Stores (ROST) rose more than 2% during the regular session but slipped 2% in after-hours trading despite reporting better-than-expected earnings and sales. Adjusted earnings of 66 cents a share topped views by 2 cents and rose 10% from a year earlier. Sales rose 7% to $3.25 billion vs. the consensus estimate of $3.21 billion.During the regular session, banks did most of the heavy lifting. Among super-regional banks, SVB Financial (SIVB) jumped nearly 7%, while Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB) rose 6%. In the money-center group, Citigroup (C) and Morgan Stanley (MS) were big winners, rising about 6% each.In the retail sector, Dollar Tree (DLTR) paid a visit to its 50-day moving average Tuesday but reversed higher after a soft start. Shares rose more than 2%. The stock is still in a buy range from a prior 8o.14 buy point. Before the open, the retailer reported its third straight quarter of declining earnings growth, but sales jumped 117% to $5.36 billion, helped by its merger last year with Family Dollar. Annual earnings growth at Dollar Tree is expected to rise more than 20% in both its current fiscal year and the next fiscal year.Elsewhere, AutoZone (AZO) gained 2%. Before the open, the company reported another quarter of solid growth, helped by upbeat industry trends and higher margins.Inside the IBD 50, Citrix Systems (CTXS) outperformed, rising 6%. It's not near a buy point yet, however, as it works on the right side of a first-stage base.At the New York Mercantile Exchange, West Texas Intermediate crude oil for April delivery settled at $34.40 a barrel, up 65 cents, or 1.9%.

Banks, steel and computer-related stocks led the upside in the stock market today. Solar stocks, gold miners and utilities lagged.On the economic front, the February ISM manufacturing index beat forecasts at 49.5, but showed contraction for a fifth consecutive month. Construction spending jumped 1.5% in January, above views for 0.5%.Apple (AAPL) led the Dow with a 4% surge in volume slightly higher than usual. The stock regained its 50-day moving average for the first time since Dec. 10. It's still well below its converged 200-day line and 25% off its 52-week high.

The iPhone maker is fighting a court order in a legal dispute related to the Dec. 2 shooting in San Bernardino, Calif.JPMorgan (JPM) rose 4% and Chevron (CVX) 3%.

109,CTXS,"Be careful about whom you listen to on Wall Street. Not one of the 30 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters came close to predicting the non-GAAP earnings of $1.66 per share Citrix Systems (CTXS) reported late Wednesday for the fourth quarter. The consensus stood at $1.19, and the highest estimate was $1.22.""What I hear is a little different than what I see,"" Executive Chairman Bob Calderoni told analysts on the company's earnings conference call late Wednesday. ""The things I see are pretty good. ... The things I hear, I don’t believe.""What Calderoni sees is a reorganized, more profitable software developer, Citrix, extending the versatility of Microsoft (MSFT) operating systems in the cloud with desktop virtualization, server and networking software known as XenApp, XenDesktop, XenMobile, ShareFile and NetScaler.Investors had driven Citrix stock down 3.4% Wednesday to 65.90, near recent lows and 21% off its three-year-plus Oct. 28 high at 84.17. But Citrix gapped up early Thursday on the report, and shares rose more than 8% in early trading in the stock market today, near 71.50.EPS minus items rose 51% from Q4 2014. Revenue rose 6% to $905 million vs. the $877 million analysts expected.What Calderoni sees are ""the competitive wins turning in our favor,"" he said. ""We see that in the win-loss data, we see that in the results,"" including a growing backlog.What he sees in the current Q1 is $785 million to $790 million in revenue, with the $787.5 million midpoint 3.5% better than Q1 2015. He sees Q1 EPS minus items of 91-93, the midpoint up 41.5%. What he hears may be the 90-cent EPS on $786 million estimated by analysts for Q1.For 2016, Citrix guided adjusted EPS to $4.65 to $4.75, the midpoint up 8.3% from 2015's $4.34,  on sales of $3.315 billion at the midpoint of a tight range, up only 1%.Cash flow from operations  in 2015 reached $1.03 billion from $846 million in 2014, and the company now has about $2 billion in cash and liquidity, COO and CFO David Henshall told analysts. The company spent about $802 million repurchasing 11.4 million shares in 2015, at an average price of $70.38 per share, strengthening the stock's market price. The board added $400 million to Citrix's authorization to buy back more stock, in addition to $33 million remaining from earlier authority, the company said.""This was another step in the right direction for Citrix as the company delivered solid results, and importantly, healthy guidance with a bigger buyback for the bulls to hang their hat on,"" FBR Capital Markets analyst Daniel Ives told IBD. ""The company clearly has growth challenges ahead, but ramping margins, free cash flow and expanding its product tentacles are key to the Street with a new CEO now at the helm.""He maintained his outperform rating and 83 price target for Citrix stock.Not everyone was as upbeat as Ives.""CTXS closed 86 transactions worth over $1 million (each, up from 58 in Q3 and 90 in Q4 2014), 20% of which included the company’s full Workspace Suite offering (which also accounted for 20% of Workspace Services license revenue vs. 9% in Q4 2014),"" Evercore ISI analyst Kirk Materne wrote in a research note Thursday. ""Notably, this segment turned in +1% year-on-year license growth and appears to be showing some early signs of stabilization under the new, refocused strategy.""He maintained a hold rating with a 72 price target.""The hard decisions have been made; that’s behind us,"" Henshall said on the call. ""Now it’s all about execution,"" including spinning off the GoTo family of businesses as a freestanding publicly traded company owned by Citrix shareholders, currently underway, and the narrowing focus on Citrix's core XenApp products. The U.S. is leading other global regions in implementing the renewed focus, including improved compensation opportunities for Citrix sales partners, the executives said.As for Kirill Tatarinov, the new CEO hired from Microsoft Business Solutions, he'd been on the job just 2-1/2 days by the time he was introduced to analysts Wednesday. He begged off when an analyst asked for his vision of what Citrix will look like in two or three years.He spoke of ""mobilitiy and secure delivery of apps and data. ... Cloud is another driver. It’s now unstoppable as people build out more data centers serving clouds. (That's) what propels this company to the future and its next phase of greatness.""But he asked for ""two more days"" before he volunteers what Citrix will look like in 2018.

122,CTXS,"Biotech Dynavax Technologies (DVAX) soared Thursday, even as the market overall crashed, after its hepatitis B vaccine beat GlaxoSmithKline's (GSK) standard product in a late-stage clinical trial.Dynavax said that its vaccine, Hepislav-B, showed a 95.4% rate of peak seroprotection, in contrast with only 81.3% for Glaxo's Engerix-B. Dynavax focused especially on patients with diabetes mellitus, who don't respond well to current vaccines and treatments. In the study, the seroprotection rate for Hepislav-B was 90%, as opposed to Engerix-B's 65.1%.The study also showed that the two vaccines had similar safety profiles. A number of adverse events occurred in both arms, mostly autoimmune-related, but Dynavax said that they were not related to vaccinations.Dynavax said that it will file for U.S. approval of Hepislav-B by the end of this quarter. Dynavax had already tried and failed to win approval in 2013, but the company says that it's now addressed all the issues that the FDA raised at the time.Dynavax stock was up nearly 30% in afternoon trading on the stock market today, near 27.50.William Blair analyst Katherine Xu raised her price target on Dynavax stock to 45 from 42 while maintaining her outperform rating.""We maintain our estimate for a Heplisav launch in the United States in third quarter 2016 in the full adult population, with $600 million in peak sales eight years into launch,"" Xu wrote in her research note. ""We expect potential approval in Europe to occur in 2019 after post-marketing studies to expand the safety database.""RBC Capital Markets analyst Simos Simeonidis was also positive on approval prospects but expressed slight concern about safety.""(The) autoimmune debate/overhang (was) not completely put to rest,"" Simeonidis wrote in his research note. ""There was an imbalance of new-onset autoimmune events in the trial: 8 in Heplisav arm vs. 1 in Engerix arm.

But Toronto-based ToolBox Solutions should provide SPS with enough analytics tools to grow revenue from grocery stores and pharmacies for years to come.Minneapolis-based SPS Commerce disclosed the $22.9 million purchase of ToolBox on Wednesday, before the market open, in the midst of the stock market tumble. It had closed 2015 last Thursday near 70, 10% off an Oct. 12 high. On the first trading day of 2016, it fell 3.4%, then 1.5% Tuesday. It closed down 3.2% Wednesday after its morning announcement.SPS Commerce stock was trading down nearly 2% as of early afternoon in the stock market today, although it had fallen more than 1% Thursday morning.Needham analyst Scott Berg said Thursday in a research note that the purchase price at 3.8 times ToolBox's estimated 2016 revenue is ""in line for pure Software-as-a-Service-based software vendors that are marginally profitable.""SPS said ToolBox may improve earnings by the first quarter of 2017. It said ToolBox should add about $1.45 million in sales in the current Q1 2016 but may take $300,000 off of adjusted earnings. For all of 2016, SPS said ToolBox should add $6 million in revenue and negatively impact adjusted EBITDA by about $800,000, as SPS absorbs $1.4 million in amortization expenses related to the purchase.SPS software serves about 60,000 customers in more than 60 countries throughout retailers' supply chains, including manufacturers, suppliers and distributors. Needham's Berg said: ""The ToolBox analytics solutions are similar to SPSC's current Collaboration Analytics offering but add specific subvertical strength in grocery, convenience stores and pharmacy stores.""Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect SPS to report earnings per share up 17% to 21 cents for Q4 when it releases 2015 performance Feb. 3, on revenue up 19% to $42.2 million.

Shares in the data center gear maker are down 23% in 2015.Unlike RBC Capital, which last week speculated that F5 Network's cash hoard and lower valuation could attract a buyer, perhaps from private equity, Nomura analyst Jeffrey Kvaal makes no mention of possible M&A.""The company now has $16 per share in cash on its balance sheet. This is despite F5's propensity for aggressive share repurchases,"" wrote Kvaal, who lowered his price target to 90. ""The company has used almost all of its free cash flow to repurchase shares. Since their peak in fiscal 2007, F5's shares outstanding have fallen from 85 million to 71 million.""He says F5 Networks should add debt to repurchase even more shares and boost EPS growth.""We believe F5 has an opportunity to make more efficient use of its balance sheet by issuing debt, buying back significantly more stock and initiating a dividend. Management has resisted such actions, given that it considers itself a growth company. The company stated it would consider a recapitalization event should its product refresh fail to reignite growth. We think the earliest opportunity to reach such a conclusion would be in late 2017.""F5 Networks is the leading maker of application delivery controllers (ADCs) — electronic boxes and software that direct data traffic to computer servers. ADCs optimize server workloads in corporate and telecom data centers, helping speed up websites and communication networks. F5 Networks bundles security and other software with its data center hardware. F5 competes with Citrix Systems (CTXS), Brocade Communications Systems (BRCD) and A10 Networks (ATEN).Follow Reinhardt Krause on Twitter @IBD_RKrause.

125,CTXS,"Cash-rich F5 Networks' (FFIV) falling stock makes the data center gear maker an attractive takeover target, speculates RBC Capital in a research report.Seattle-based F5 is the leading maker of application delivery controllers (ADCs) — electronic boxes that direct data traffic to computer servers. Its stock is down 23% since July 31, when it touched an 11-month high — and near all-time high — of 135.20. F5 Networks stock was up more than 1% in early trading in the stock market today, near 104.F5 has surfaced other times as a potential buyout candidate, with some of tech's biggest names — including IBM (IBM) and Cisco Systems (CSCO) — said to be interested.Bears say that F5 will not regain double-digit revenue growth, despite its push into security products. F5, though, is sitting on $1.2 billion in cash and has no debt, RBC analyst Mark Sue says in the report. He says that F5 generates free cash flow — net cash from operations minus capital expenses — in excess of $500 million a year.""External investors are starting to sniff around F5's low (price-earnings) multiple and strong cash generation,"" Sue wrote. ""If anything, we see a leveraged re-cap, possible privatization or even a management buyout as increasing possibilities.""ADCs optimize server workloads in corporate and telecom data centers, helping speed up websites and communication networks. F5 bundles security and other software with its data center hardware. F5 competes with Citrix Systems (CTXS), Brocade Communications Systems (BRCD) and A10 Networks (ATEN).""Investors are saying the ADC market is slowing, security is too competitive, and thus the business should be run for cash and F5 should join others as a dividend payer,"" Sue said. He says that F5 could make its own acquisition.""F5 is eager to do M&A, but private valuations are still too high for security companies, and F5 has a mixed track record,"" he wrote.Follow Reinhardt Krause on Twitter @IBD_RKrause.

"
129,CTXS,"If investors got everything they wanted from Citrix Systems' (CTXS) decision to spin off the GoTo family of businesses, why did Citrix stock fall like a dead weight Wednesday morning?Perhaps because analysts can see more clearly now the work and time still required to achieve their goals.Shares tumbled 8% after the morning bell in the stock market today, after the CEO late Tuesday announced that Citrix would spin off its GoTo family of businesses into its own publicly traded corporation, designed as a tax-free deal for investors, unlike an outright sale might have been.Citrix is a leading enabler of the migration to cloud computing by selling software as a service.Citrix is ""on the right track, but the path is still uphill,"" wrote Pacific Crest Securities analyst Rob Owens in a research note issued after the disclosures.""Overall, we view management's operational announcements as necessary for the future of the business, but see increased near-term execution risk and continued lackluster growth. We remain on the sidelines.""Owens reiterated a ""sector weight"" rating without a price target.Shares were trading down 9% at 71.32 by early afternoon, about 14% off a three-year high near 84 set Oct. 28.With a healthy Composite Rating of 91, Citrix is a member of IBD's Computer Software-Specialty Enterprise industry group, third in market capitalization behind VMware (VM) and CA (CA). VMware market value is about $24 billion with CA at about half that size. Citrix's market value stands at $10.9 billion.The uphill path will require the layoff of about 1,000 employees and contractors outside the GoTo family separation — that is happening this month and in January, Citrix said — and the reduction of other Citrix operating expenses by $200 million in the next 18 months, most of which will occur in 2016.Also, ""to achieve this focus (on Citrix's core software virtualization businesses), the company will end investment in certain other products and programs, in some cases moving technologies into strategic products, in other cases providing an orderly end-of-life to noncore products,"" the company said.""The evaluation of all products, technologies, offerings and programs is ongoing, and will focus on enterprise readiness, ability to drive customer value, and growth and profitability prospects.""The surviving Citrix, with roughly $2.6 billion in sales, will include the application virtualization, network management and performance management software businesses handling XenApp, XenDesktop, XenMobile, ShareFile and NetScaler products.The spinoff will be composed of GoToAssist, GoToMeeting, GoToMyPC, GoToTraining, GoToWebinar, Grasshopper and OpenVoice, products with combined sales of about $600 million for the 12 months that ended Sept. 30, the company said.The company plans to fold underlying Bytemobile technologies into the NetScaler platform, while winding down Bytemobile, Podio and WorkspacePod.Currently, Citrix is ""too broad and complex,"" Bob Calderoni, the interim CEO of Citrix, told analysts after Tuesday's announcement. Calderoni succeeded 14-year CEO Mark Templeton in July. He'd been under pressure from activist investor Elliott Management.Immediately following the separation, Citrix shareholders will own shares in two publicly traded companies.Citrix has been studying the reorganization since midyear and has retained Goldman Sachs and Qatalyst Partners as financial advisers.""Upon review, it is clear to us that the GoTo family of products is best suited to grow and operate as a stand-alone business,"" said Calderoni in the announcement. ""This separation will create a leading, pure-play SaaS (software-as-a-service) company that will have a targeted focus with the flexibility to invest in its portfolio of products.""It will also allow Citrix to refocus and amplify investment in our core mission to enable secure and reliable delivery of apps and data for the modern enterprise. We look forward to a seamless transition for our employees, customers, partners and other key stakeholders.""Chris Hylen, senior vice president and general manager of the Citrix Mobility Apps business unit, will serve as CEO of the spinoff company. Calderoni said that a CEO for Citrix will be announced ""in the not too distant future."" Candidates are being vetted currently.After the announcement, responding to a securities analyst who wondered if the new CEO would be hamstrung by being required to spin off the GoTo family, Calderoni said his successor's job would be easier.""The worst CEO job to have is to be the head of a company that is spread too wide and too thin,"" said Calderoni. ""We're setting up the company very well. It will be focused, and it'll be profitable . .. . Investment dollars are hard to find when you're trying to feed too many things.""Bhavan Suri, a William Blair analyst, anticipated the spinoff in a research note last week.""We estimate the GoTo assets to contribute approximately 57 cents EPS in 2016 (assuming 6.5% sales growth and 18% operating margin on a stand-alone basis),"" Suri wrote. ""This would result in an implied stock price of $14.26 and is based on a forward-looking price-to-earnings ratio of 25 times, which we believe is reasonable, given that we suspect the company could not find a buyer for the segment (excluding ShareFile) at 4.5 times 2016 revenue.""The software maker said in July that it expects full-year adjusted earnings of $3.65 to $3.75 a share, where analysts had modeled $3.56.Acknowledging the ""disruption"" that spinning off GoTo products will cause, Citrix is now guiding net revenue growth of 1% to 2%, an adjusted operating margin ""of at least 28%,"" and adjusted earnings of $4.40 to $4.50 per share for the fiscal year ending Dec. 31, 2016.For the current fiscal 2015, analysts polled by Thomson Reuters anticipate adjusted EPS of $3.88 on revenue of $3.25 billion, with revenue increasing to $3.4 billion in 2016. The company says that 2017 revenue likely will grow 4% to 5%; the company is targeting an adjusted operating margin of ""at least"" 30% by then.""Citrix is still a very relevant IT player,"" said FBR analyst Daniel Ives in a research note, ""and now it all comes down to leveraging that position into tangential growth opportunities within the data center and cloud computing shift, with all eyes on rekindling growth on its core desktop/cloud franchise. We maintain our outperform rating.""Citrix peer VMWare's stock was down 2.6% in early afternoon trade Wednesday. CA Technologies was up 3.9% on a dividend increase and increased share buyback program.

"
224,CTXS,"But it wasn't just that, some said, as Red Hat also disappointed with its billing numbers. Oppenheimer's Brian Schwartz noted that although currency changes affected valuations by 8%, billing growth of 9% still fell short of expectations.
"
225,CTXS,"""Billings (at) 9% is not enough to excite investors and it is the slowest growth for them in eight quarters with tougher year-to-year billings comparisons lying ahead,"" Schwartz said.

Sales are also expected to reach $2.03 billion to $2.04 billion, slightly ahead of views and up 14% from 2015 at the midpoint.

228,CTXS,"While Schwartz was concerned about billing figures for Red Hat, other analysts said it may not be worth worrying about.

""Overall, we believe Red Hat is one of the best-positioned infrastructure providers in software, with strong execution, a product portfolio that is well-aligned with prevailing technology trends, solid and consistent growth, and continued operating leverage.""Jason Ader, an analyst at William Blair, echoed a similar tone in his research note to clients.""Red Hat looks optimally positioned to take advantage of the larger trend toward enterprise adoption of open source software and hybrid cloud technology, in our view,"" Ader wrote.Red Hat's rivals include Oracle (ORCL), Intel's (INTC) Wind River Systems, Symantec (SYMC), Check Point Software Technologies (CHKP), CA (CA) and Citrix Systems (CTXS).Follow Russ Britt on Twitter @IBD_RBritt and on Facebook.

254,CTXS,"F5 Networks (FFIV), a maker of application delivery controllers (ADCs), has continued its winning ways under new CEO Manuel Rivelo, boosting revenue and profit by capitalizing on high demand for new software and security services to guard against digital data breaches. The Seattle-based company, whose client base ranges from the U.S. government to Facebook (FB), is the No. 1 seller of ADCs. The electronic devices direct traffic to corporate computer servers and data centers, helping to make websites and communication networks faster and more efficient.F5 has in recent years expanded its ties with customers by also selling them security products and services, and continues to do so under Rivelo. Demand in this arena is mounting amid a torrent of headlines about major organizations suffering cyberattacks that resulted in costly data breaches. In recent months alone, cybercriminals have infiltrated systems at Harvard University, health insurer Anthem (WLP), and the U.S. government's Office of Personnel Management.F5 competes with Citrix Systems (CTXS), Brocade Communications Systems (BRCD) and A10 Networks (ATEN). The company is part of IBD's Internet-Network Solutions group, which also includes Rackspace Hosting (RAX), Akamai Technologies (AKAM) and Equinix (EQIX).""It's just going to keep growing and growing,"" U.S. Global Investors trader Mike Matousek told IBD, referring to demand for data security. He said investors are increasingly interested in companies such as F5 because they are continuously hearing that organizations fear the worst when it comes to cybersecurity and view as vital their ongoing investments in the latest technology to thwart breaches.Investors See Opportunity""So there's more opportunity here,"" Matousek said. ""There's a lot of potential ahead.""F5's stock is up about 14% over the past year. The company in July posted fiscal third-quarter revenue of $483.6 million, up 10% from a year earlier, and GAAP net income of $93.2 million, up 8.7%. On a per-share non-GAAP basis, earnings rose 5% to $1.67.The sales trajectory is expected to continue. For the quarter ending Sept. 30, F5 set a revenue goal of $500 million to $510 million.A company executive told IBD that F5 does not break out the percentage of its product revenue generated by its security business. But during the company's earnings call in July, F5 executives said software sales, which are often linked with security services, have more than doubled over the past three years and now make up about a third of revenue. Customers, the company said, are moving more of their systems into the cloud, via software, and need accompanying security protections.Rivelo, a former Cisco Systems executive, officially took the helm at F5 on July 1. But he began leading the company after his promotion, from executive vice president of strategic solutions to CEO, was announced last spring. He replaced John McAdam, who had been F5 Networks' chief executive for about 15 years.Rivelo was not available to comment for this article, but during the earnings call he said F5's security business will remain ""a major growth driver"" for the company.Given the spate of highly publicized cyberattacks, he added, ""more customers from an increasing diverse pool are approaching F5 for our ability to secure applications, manage user policy and access, and mitigate application attacks across traditional data centers, and public and private clouds.""Rivelo said in F5's third quarter alone it established major new business relationships on the security front with a branch of the U.S. government and ""a prestigious medical research group,"" among others.New Global Sales ChiefCFO Andy Reinland told investors recently that security ""continues to be key for us. And we're going to continue to incentivize the sales force to really push that."" This week F5 named John DiLullo to lead global sales, reporting to Rivelo.James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management and an observer of companies affected by cyberattacks including banks, said in an interview that ""it is hard to see where the threat ends.""He said regulators of various industries and leaders of major governments around the world are increasingly paying attention to cybersecurity and likely will over time join forces to create stronger global security standards. This, he said, should make it easier for companies and governments to work together to combat cybercriminals.Should all of that materialize in coming years, Paulsen said, it could help more companies get beyond playing catch-up on the security front and instead make investments to continuously stay ahead of criminals. This, he said, could ultimately minimize the number of high-profile breaches. But it would not diminish the need for high-level security services.Looking For Acquisitions""It's never going to go away,"" he said of the threat of attacks. ""They aren't going to just shut this down, but the good guys are going to get better and better at this.""Toward that end, F5 said it is on the lookout for acquisitions that can fortify its suite of products and help drive more growth.""We look for a nice technology tuck-in that we can bring in, integrate the code into the platform, and then offer it as part of a platform solution,"" Rivelo said at an August conference. ""We do aggressively look at companies ... We look at them every week.""He said sellers' pricing expectations are currently a bit lofty. ""In general, right now it's a little heated,"" Rivelo said of the M&A market. But if F5 finds an appealing and affordable target, ""we'll bring it on board to accelerate our roadmap and our vision.""

357,CTXS,"VMware (VMW) received a downgrade and price target reduction Monday from an analyst who anticipates that the enterprise software company will face growth headwinds in the second half of 2015 and next year.

358,CTXS,"Piper Jaffray downgraded F5 Networks on views that earnings growth will slow from the mid-20s to the mid-teens and uncertainty over a new CEO's strategic steps. F5 Networks stock was down 2.5% in afternoon trading in the stock market today, near 120.50. Shares of Seattle-based F5 Networks are down about 8% in 2015, but F5 has a good IBD Composite…
"
359,CTXS,"Manny Rivelo, incoming chief executive of F5 Networks, has a tough act to follow, but he has brought a new way of thinking at the company. Under John McAdam, F5's CEO since 2000, the company grew to $1.7 billion in 2014 revenue, up from $100 million when he took the reins. McAdam is retiring June 30, but will stay on as board chairman.
"
360,CTXS,"Seattle-based F5 Networks (FFIV) is the No. 1 seller of application delivery controllers, which direct data traffic to computer servers. ADCs optimize server workloads in corporate and telecom data centers, helping speed up websites and communication networks.
"
361,CTXS,"Rivelo knows what it takes to grow scale in the IT industry, having worked at Cisco Systems (CSCO) for 19 years before joining F5 as vice president of security and strategic solutions in 2011. Cisco grew into a $44 billion company by the time Rivelo had departed. Its 20-year CEO, John Chambers, is retiring in July.
"
362,CTXS,"At Cisco, Rivelo's responsibilities spanned both engineering and sales.
"
363,CTXS,"Rivelo already has helped put in place strategies that aim to keep F5 a leader in information technology, as cloud computing drives big changes in corporate data centers. F5 is pushing into corporate security and subscription-based software, aiming to sell ADC-as-a-service.
"
364,CTXS,"""Manny has really driven strategy (amid) a very disruptive technology environment,"" McAdam told IBD. ""He brought a focus on software solutions, subscriptions and made us think about things we tended not to think about.""
"
365,CTXS,"F5's hardware business is still healthy, as customers upgrade to a new generation — ""big IP"" — of ADCs that handle higher data traffic. Building up F5's software business, though, is key.
"
366,CTXS,"For several years now F5 has sold software-based, or virtual, ADCs that run on low-end servers in data centers.
"
367,CTXS,"In November, F5 unveiled a cloud strategy called ""Silverline,"" that at first will focus on security products. The Silverline service is similar in concept to infrastructure-as-a-service, or IaaS, by which client companies rent computers and data storage via the Internet. Rivelo says F5's Silverline customer will be able to buy its software security products and eventually ADC software.
"
368,CTXS,"""If we're able to execute on our strategy, that subscription business will become material in a couple of years and we'll have a long tail of revenue coming from that,"" Rivelo said in an interview.
"
369,CTXS,"For shareholders, one question is whether Rivelo can keep F5's revenue growth in the double digits, or at least above the IT industry average. Many large companies are spending less on their own IT equipment, choosing instead to rent computing and data storage resources via the Internet.
"
370,CTXS,"F5's revenue growth has slowed to the midteens from blistering 30%-40% growth in 2010-11. F5 stock was a big winner in 2009 and 2010, but it touched its all-time high in January 2011 — above 145. Shares touched a three-year high above 136 in December and are now trading near 128.
"
371,CTXS,"With analysts expecting consolidation among IT hardware and software companies, another question is whether F5 will be a buyer, a seller or stay on the sidelines. Bernstein Research speculated this year that data storage system maker EMC (EMC) could target F5. And Cisco, which makes a ton of acquisitions, is also a potential buyer.
"
372,CTXS,"Rivelo says one of F5's strengths is its many partnerships across the IT industry. Partners include Cisco, VMware (VMW) and more recently in the public cloud, IaaS leader Amazon Web Services, part of Amazon.com (AMZN). It's also teamed with Ericsson (ERIC) and Alcatel-Lucent (ALU).
"
373,CTXS,"Rivelo says F5 Networks may be better off staying independent, rather than being acquired by a bigger company. Besides the EMC speculation by Bernstein in March, F5 seems to surface as a rumored takeover target roughly every other year. The company's market valuation exceeds $9 billion.
"
374,CTXS,"""Part of our value is that we're sort of (technology) agnostic,"" he said. ""We think we're in a good position to help our customers and grow our business.
"
375,CTXS,"""If we were acquired, the (product) integration would be much more vertical, and our solution set could be more limited in the market because of the vertical integration an acquirer would want. Being independent is probably the right approach as we move forward.""
"
376,CTXS,"F5 Networks competes with Citrix Systems (CTXS), Brocade Communications (BRCD) and A10 Networks (ATEN). Aside from F5's security push, analysts have been upbeat on its prospects in software-defined networking, or SDN, which centralizes control of network security, storage systems and servers connected to networks.
"
377,CTXS,"SDN targets communications networks and tasks usually performed by routers and other specialized hardware. SDN, which many analysts saw as a threat to F5's core business, has turned into a sales channel opportunity for F5, with partners such as Cisco and VMware.
"
378,CTXS,"Many large companies are interested in a public-private hybrid cloud model — running the most important business apps on their own servers behind a private corporate firewall and accessing public IaaS providers as needed.
"
379,CTXS,"Rivelo says F5 Networks is focused on the hybrid-cloud segment.
"
380,CTXS,"""Our strategy is to drive a hybrid set of solutions,"" he said. ""We see the modernization of the private data center as a combination, or a mix, of hardware and software, making applications more agile using a software-defined architecture.

436,CTXS,"F5 Networks soared in 2014 and looks poised for another strong run this year. Demand is mounting for its security products as clients do more business via digital means and require heightened protection from hackers.Though not solely a security provider, Seattle-based F5 (FFIV) says that it is well-positioned to meet increasing needs on that front, needs amplified in 2014 by a range of breaches, from a cyberattack on banking giant JPMorgan Chase (JPM) to the infamous attack on Sony (SNE) and release of its executives' internal emails.Cooper Werner, F5's senior vice president of finance, told investors recently that the percentage of the company's product revenue tied to its security business reached 36% in the fiscal year ended Sept. 30. It marked a 41% year-over-year jump.""Obviously, this is probably the biggest driver to our overall growth,"" Werner said while speaking at an investor conference hosted by Barclays in December.In its latest completed fiscal year, F5's revenue climbed 17% to $1.73 billion. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters project top-line growth of 13% for the current fiscal year.Upselling SafetyF5, whose clients include big online operators such as Facebook (FB) and Pandora Media (P), is the leading seller of application delivery controllers. ADCs are electronic devices that, in a nutshell, efficiently direct traffic to corporate computer servers and data centers, enhancing the work processed in these areas and boosting website and communication network speeds.Werner said that F5 has worked to deepen business relationships with its ADC clients by also offering them data-center security products and services.In short, F5 views security ""as a natural extension of its ADC offerings, to help applications perform efficiently"" and make them ""more secure,"" as UBS analyst Amitabh Passi summed it up in a research note to clients.With demand now surging for data center protections, F5 finds itself at the center of what many observers expect will prove a long-running trend.""All it takes is a read of the headlines to see why demand for data security is on the rise and will continue to rise,"" BMO Private Bank Chief Investment Officer Jack Ablin told IBD.""I think that is the next frontier,"" Ablin said. He added that companies staking their ground now stand to be well-positioned to capitalize on the secular trend.F5's stock surged nearly 44% in 2014. It finished the final trading day of the year at $130 per share. It currently trades near 128.F5 is the No. 3 company by market cap after Equinix (EQIX) and Akamai Technologies (AKAM) in the Internet-Network Solutions industry group, which ranks No. 38 out of 197 groups that IBD tracks. The next largest players in the category are Rackspace Hosting (RAX) and SolarWinds (SWI). With an IBD Composite Rating of 98, F5 is one of the highest-rated companies in the Internet-Network Solutions group, topped only by Rackspace and SolarWinds, each of which gets a 99.A global survey by PricewaterhouseCoopers found that information security breaches skyrocketed in 2014, leaping 48% from 2013 to 42.8 million detected incidents. Total financial losses attributed to security compromises jumped 34% over 2013, the PWC survey said.""The rise in security incidents would account for some of this increase in financial losses, of course. But another explanation might be that today's more sophisticated compromises often extend beyond IT to other areas of the business, and financial losses may now include remediation of more customer impacts and not just operational disruptions,"" PricewaterhouseCoopers said in a report. Companies and organizations ""must remain vigilant and agile in the face of a continually evolving threat landscape.""GBT Capital Management Chairman Gary Townsend told IBD that cyberattack concerns are deepening and spreading across sectors, making security a top priority for companies of all sizes. ""One needs to be concerned about it everywhere,"" he said. ""No one is immune from attack.""Demand OutlookDeutsche Bank analysts said in a December note that their recent checks on F5 suggested ""no incremental slowdown in demand"" for the company's services, indicating that results for the quarter that ended Dec. 31 are likely to be strong. The analysts cited ""an expanding order pipeline"" for application and cloud-based security products from Fortune 500 companies.Depending on the traffic level and the number of servers needed to manage it, F5 charges between $50,000 and $300,000 for its ADCs. Competitors include Citrix Systems (CTXS) and A10 Networks (ATEN). F5 also sells virtual ADCs that run in clients' data centers as opposed to on F5's own hardware.Analysts on average anticipate that F5 will report earnings per share of $1.49 for the quarter that ended Dec. 31, which would be up 22% year over year, on sales of $467 million, which would be up 15%. The Deutsche Bank analysts anticipate that the momentum will continue. ""We see 2015 as a positive year,"" they wrote. The analysts have a buy rating on F5, with a $150 price target.Brent Bracelin, an analyst at Pacific Crest Securities, recently raised his price target on F5 to $162 from $153 and kept an outperform rating. In a December research note, Bracelin cited F5's ""increasingly strategic positioning in security headed into the new year.""Acquisitions have augmented F5's growth. In 2014, the company bought Defense.Net, a provider of cloud-based security services. And in 2013, it acquired Versafe, whose software guards Web applications from malware and fraud. Analysts anticipate more deals to come, providing an additional reason to expect growth.Speaking at the Barclays conference in December, Edward Eames, F5's executive vice president of business operations, said that the company could continue on the M&A path, with a focus on small, add-on deals.""I think we're very happy with the small technology purchase — and then fold that into the company and add it into our product line,"" Eames said.""And that's definitely the strategy we have going forward. So I don't think we'd be looking for larger M&A,"" he said. ""But yes, security, cloud — perhaps services and subscription around the two, as well — would all be focus areas, and we are continuing to look.""

437,CTXS,"What's the next step for Docker, one of Silicon's Valley's hottest startups?It's not an initial public offering — at least not this year, apparently. The well-funded, lean company says that it's in no rush to go public.While buoyed by success among Internet and cloud computing companies, Docker is still improving its ""container"" software technology. Docker's software makes it easier to develop business apps for cloud computing services. The container approach packages apps for distribution over the Internet.Amazon.com's (AMZN) Amazon Web Services (AWS) and rival cloud services units from Google (GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT), among others, have integrated support for Docker's software.""Containers are the darling technology for the cloud, whether it's Google or AWS,"" said Al Sadowski, an analyst at 451 Research. ""The idea is like a shipping container. They're all the same size, all the same measurements. You just plug the app in. It's more efficient with less overhead.""Docker's software runs on Linux, an open-source operating system. It's free to software developers, who are key to driving the adoption of emerging technologies. Docker aims to make money from technical support, training, its own cloud-based services and specialized versions of its software.Need To Convince Big UsersAnalysts say that one of Docker's first goals is to make its container software more popular among big companies and other enterprise customers. Cloud computing enables companies to share business resources with customers and suppliers via the Internet. Some large firms have been slow to adopt cloud-based services due to concerns that their data centers could be vulnerable to cyberattacks. One of Docker's challenges is to convince enterprise customers that running cloud-based container software poses no security issues.""The next step for Docker as a company is to add additional security, building out management tools, and storage management — making containers easier to use and easier to manage, like virtual machines are today,"" said Dave Bartoletti, a Forrester Research analyst.Virtualization technology leader VMware (VMW) might have reason to worry over Docker's rise, say some Wall Street analysts. EMC (EMC) spun off VMware in 2007, retaining an 80% stake. VMware's virtualization software is widely used in corporate data centers. The software enables computer servers to run different operating systems and apps, and share workloads.Linux-based containers are virtualization technologies, explains Gartner analyst Lydia Leong. But she says that Docker's app containers are not a replacement for VMware's software.""Docker is especially well-suited to new application development projects,"" Leong said. ""Containers are fast, efficient and lightweight, but they will not replace existing virtualized apps any time soon.""But Docker can help companies build, test and deploy new containerized applications faster, with the freedom to run on a wide range of cloud and (data center) server platforms.""Leong says that companies might stick with VMware-based solutions for security reasons.Getting More AttentionWall Street, though, is keeping an eye on the privately held Docker.""Emerging container technologies could pose a threat to vendors such as VMware and Citrix Systems (CTXS),"" said William Blair analyst Jason Ader in a recent research report. ""Microsoft's statement that it will support Docker containers in its future Windows Server platform release is a major development. Containers offer compelling advantages over virtual machine-based architectures that include faster deployment times.""Backers of OpenStack, a cloud computing software platform with wide support, also plan to support Docker technology. OpenStack supporters position the open-source software as an alternative to VMware.In a research note, Nomura Securities analyst Rick Sherlund called Docker ""a growing competitive threat to VMware."" Yet, Sherlund says, many corporate information technology departments are not ready to deploy container tech.Forrester's Bartoletti says that VMware has a ""bull's-eye"" on its back if it doesn't respond. He says that open-source Linux leader Red Hat (RHT) might, to a lesser extent, also see Docker's popularity raise strategic questions.VMware has paid attention. In December, VMware said that it would integrate Docker tech into its server virtualization software.In September, Docker said that it had raised $40 million from private investors, raising its total venture capital funding to near $65 million, analysts say.Docker isn't the only new player in container technology. One rival is San Francisco-based CoreOS. Gartner's Leong says that Docker is well ahead of other startups.

440,CTXS,"F5 Networks' (FFIV) fiscal Q1 EPS is expected to rise 22% with revenue up 15%, as analysts expect upside from F5's push into computer security products.Seattle-based F5 is slated to report December-quarter earnings after the market close on Wednesday.The data center gear maker is expected to earn $1.49 per share, up from 1.22 in the year-earlier quarter, estimate analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. Analysts are modeling revenue of $467.3 million, up from $370.3 million.F5 is the No. 1 seller of ADCs, electronic boxes that direct data traffic to computer servers. Application Delivery Controllers optimize server workloads in corporate and telecom data centers, helping speed up websites and communication networks. Analysts expect F5 to get a boost from security products sold to large companies. F5 bundles security and other software with its data-center hardware.Phone companies and government agencies are also among F5's customers.""Telco remains a wild card and typically represents 20% to 25% of sales in a quarter,"" Tim Long, a BMO Capital Markets analyst, said in a research report.William Blair analyst Jason Ader, in a research note Tuesday, said his firm's survey of 44 value-added resellers found that enterprise spending accelerated in Q4 following a prolonged period of underinvestment and that ""feedback on F5 remained strong, with resellers reporting vigorous data center activity, product refreshes and growing security attach rates.""F5 stock rose 43% in 2014, and it ranks No. 41 in the latest IBD 50 listing of top-performing stocks over the past 12 months.F5 stock edged up a fraction in early trading in the stock market today, near 127, but shares are down 2.5% this year. The stock is trading below its 128.40 November breakout.IBD's Internet-Network Solutions group ranks No. 39 out of 197 industry groups. Besides F5, it includes Rackspace Hosting (RAX), Akamai Technologies (AKAM), Equinix (EQIX)and SolarWinds (SWI).For the current quarter, fiscal Q2, analysts estimate F5 will report EPS growth of 20% on revenue growth of 14%.""March tends to be seasonally weaker,"" said Mark Sue, an analyst at RBC Capital, in a research report.Amid currency weakness in Europe and Japan, exchange rates are expected to be a factor for a wide range of companies reporting earnings and might affect guidance by F5 and others, analysts say.F5 competes with Citrix Systems (CTXS), Riverbed Technology (RVBD) and A10 Networks (ATEN). Aside from F5's security push, analysts have been upbeat on its prospects in software-defined networking, or SDN, which centralizes control of network security, storage systems and servers connected to networks.

443,CTXS,"OpenStack could soon be the software that runs the non-Amazon cloud.Open-source software available for free, OpenStack helps corporate IT departments manage data centers packed with computer servers.OpenStack has also gained popularity as a tool to connect data centers to public clouds, where computing resources are shared via the Internet.But Amazon.com's (AMZN) Amazon Web Services (AWS) is by far the biggest provider of infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS). And it uses its own software, not OpenStack.Still, OpenStack has gained popularity among enterprises that want to use multiple cloud platforms.For investors, the question is: which companies will gain the most from OpenStack's rise as a cloud operating system?""There's a big roster of household name IT vendors that are backing OpenStack — Intel (INTC), IBM (IBM), Cisco Systems (CSCO), Dell and HP (HPQ) — a lot of companies have placed a bet,"" said Al Sadowski, an analyst at 451 Research.Worries over whether OpenStack could handle large business workloads have eased. So OpenStack seems primed for wide adoption, though there are open-source rivals such as Citrix Systems' (CTXS) CloudStack, points out James Staten, a Forrester Research analyst.""The concerns now are less about the platform itself and who is influencing its development,"" Staten told IBD. ""The concerns instead are about who takes OpenStack successfully to market and begins to lead through market power. That's a key theme worth watching in 2015.""Rackspace, NASA DevelopedRackspace Hosting (RAX) and government space agency NASA co-developed OpenStack in 2010, aiming to make the software a cloud computing standard. Rackspace's main business has been hosting websites. Rackspace stepped up investments in OpenStack in 2012 and 2013, but its revenue growth slowed as companies lingered in testing OpenStack's capabilities.Rackspace now supports multiple cloud platforms and has become less dependent on OpenStack near term.""While Rackspace continues to develop solutions on the OpenStack platform, management is providing managed cloud solutions across multiple technologies,"" wrote James Breen, a William Blair analyst, in a research report last month.The OpenStack ecosystem is growing, says 451 Research. The market research firm says that OpenStack-related revenue will rise to $3.49 billion in 2018 from $890 million in 2014.""All OpenStack needs to do is get to the same reliability and resiliency as the computing platforms it's replacing,"" Sadowski said. ""It's clear, though, that OpenStack is gaining mindshare and marketing power.""Early backers hoped that OpenStack would slow the march of AWS. Oppenheimer analyst Tim Horan estimates that AWS revenue will jump 40% to roughly $5 billion in 2015. Even so, ""OpenStack is starting to mature as enterprises shift legacy IT workloads to cloud environments,"" Horan said.Expedia (EXPE), Walt Disney (DIS), Time Warner Cable (TWC), Wells Fargo (WFC) and BMW are among recent OpenStack adopters, says 451 Research. Earlier users included eBay's (EBAY) PayPal, Best Buy (BBY) and Fidelity Investments.To attract corporate customers, OpenStack supporters positioned the open-source software as an alternative to VMware 's (VMW) software, widely used in data centers to make servers more efficient.Red Hat (RHT), the leading provider of Linux open-source server software and a VMware rival, has lined up behind OpenStack.But pushing its own cloud platform is still VMware's top priority, analysts say. With partners such as the privately held Mirantis, VMware sells software that helps its customers use OpenStack for building so-called ""private"" cloud data centers that are accessible by branch offices, clients and others.Analysts say that most enterprises are interested in a public-private hybrid cloud model — running the most important business apps on their own servers behind a private corporate firewall and accessing public IaaS providers as needed.Many tech vendors are focused on providing tools for hybrid clouds. Rackspace aims to provide managed services in the hybrid cloud market rather than struggle vs. much bigger IaaS firms AWS, Microsoft (MSFT) and Google (GOOGL).Positioned As Cloud Concierge""Rackspace continues to remain technology agnostic even as the company's OpenStack is increasingly attractive as a platform for public cloud,"" said Barclays analyst Sandeep Gupta in a report. ""As AWS, Microsoft and Google continue to put pressure on pricing, we wouldn't be surprised if Rackspace positions itself as a cloud concierge to a hybrid cloud environment.""Many tech suppliers aim to use OpenStack to bridge private and public clouds.""The strong leaders in OpenStack today are a mix. Hewlett-Packard and Red Hat are clearly strong voices in the community, as is SuSE, Mirantis, Internap (INAP) and arguably Cisco Systems due to their recent moves,"" said Forrester's Staten. ""Rackspace still has a strong voice, IBM to a lesser degree, as they are really only focusing on it for their private cloud initiatives.""IBM last year acquired cloud-service firm SoftLayer for $2 billion. HP has said that it'll spend $1 billion over the next two years on products and services around OpenStack.451 Research says that Europe-based OVH and startup Blue Box have gained traction with OpenStack customers. Some companies are using acquisitions to gain a foothold in cloud computing services and OpenStack. EMC (EMC), another cloud company, acquired Cloudscaling in October, Cisco bought Metacloud in September and Red Hat purchased eNovance in June.Lydia Leong, an analyst with research firm Gartner, agrees that OpenStack has gained momentum. The OpenStack Foundation, with more than 430 members, has regularly rolled out improved versions of the software.""OpenStack is gaining more traction than it had before as the product starts to become more useable,"" Leong told IBD. ""The primary beneficiaries are those that sell (software) distributions, such as Red Hat, HP and Mirantis.""

444,CTXS,"Following a rebound year, F5 Networks touts security products as the main engine that will keep its revenue growing at double-digit rates.One question on Wall Street, though, is whether F5 Networks' (FFIV) security push will expand from the data center, where F5's application delivery controllers (ADCs) give it the inside track to win add-on business, to corporate firewalls that sit between private networks and the Internet.F5 Networks is the No. 1 seller of ADCs, electronic boxes that direct data traffic to computer servers. ADCs optimize server workloads in corporate and telecom data centers, helping speed up websites and communication networks. It has not been big in firewalls.The so-called perimeter firewall market — the main type of firewall — is about $7 billion a year, says research firm Infonetics. But it's a crowded field, with Check Point Software Technologies (CHKP), Cisco Systems (CSCO), Palo Alto Networks (PANW) and Juniper Networks (JNPR) among the suppliers of firewall security products.Seattle-based F5 Networks says that it's sticking with a focus on data center security as opposed to firewalls, despite speculation otherwise.""The perimeter is going away,"" F5 CEO John McAdam said at the company's annual investor meeting last month. ""The cloud is going to change everything. We think being in the data center and understanding applications is a major advantage.""Cloud computing enables companies to share business resources with customers and suppliers via the Internet.Protects Against DDoS AttacksF5 in May acquired Defense.Net, a provider of cloud-based security services that help protect websites from large-scale distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks that make servers unavailable to users. In 2013, F5 Networks bought Israel-based Versafe. Its software protects Web applications from malware, fraud and phishing attacks.F5's security-related acquisitions go back to 2004 and likely are not done, analysts say. But F5 Networks has a checkered track record overall with acquisitions. One that never panned out as expected was its 2007 purchase of network storage vendor Acopia Networks.""Their M&A strategy appears to be focused on (smaller) tuck-ins, though there is always a possibility of a larger deal,"" said UBS analyst Amitabh Passi.At F5 Networks' investor day, McAdam said, ""We don't have a budget as such for M&A. We have a lot of cash, and we'll use the cash if we think we can basically get technology that's probably on our road map. ... Two areas that we've been more focused on than anything are security, No. 1, and service provider (telecom companies), No. 2.""In its fiscal year, which ended Sept. 30, F5's revenue rose 17% to $1.73 billion. In the current fiscal year, analysts polled by Thomson Reuters model sales growth of 13% followed by 12% growth in fiscal 2016.McAdam called security ""probably our biggest growth driver for the next five years.""Some analysts are cautious.""While opportunities for F5 in security are encouraging, we think they are already discounted into consensus expectations and reflected in the current evaluation,"" Frederick Grieb, an analyst at Nomura Securities, wrote in a research report.F5's stock has shot up more than 45% in 2014.Jayson Noland, an analyst at R.W. Baird, said in a research report that F5 is making its name in security. ""Our channel discussions are generally positive on F5's security offerings,"" he wrote, ""though the company is not typically considered a primary security supplier.""F5's ADCs cost $50,000 to $300,000, depending on how many servers and how much traffic they handle. F5 competes with Citrix Systems (CTXS), which has a security-related pact with Palo Alto Networks, as well as Radware (RDWR) and A10 Networks (ATEN) .F5 Networks also sells software-based ADCs, or virtual ADCs, that run on low-end servers in data centers rather than on its own hardware. F5 has expanded into data center security by selling software modules from Versafe and Defense.Net that run on its ADCs.""F5 seems to be making a push toward more license/subscription revenue with both its core ADC platforms and security,"" said Barclays analyst Ben Reitzes in a research note.Brent Bracelin, an analyst at Pacific Crest Securities, this month raised his price target on F5 stock to 163 from 153, ""to factor in the company's opportunity to continue expanding its security business in fiscal 2015. Overall, security software that is bundled with ADC appliances has increased to 36% of revenue from 30% last year.""In ADC security, F5 competes with Imperva (IMPV) and Verizon Communications (VZ), which sells a cloud-based Web application firewall.Imperva could be a more formidable rival if it's acquired by the likes of Hewlett-Packard (HPQ), EMC (EMC) or Oracle (ORCL), speculates Jonathan Ho, analyst at William Blair.""Imperva and F5 are the leaders in data-center web-application firewalls today,"" Ho told IBD in an email. ""The WAF secures Web servers and is a completely different product than a perimeter firewall.""He says software modules that provide threat detection capability put F5 Networks in competition with Juniper and Fortinet (FTNT), more so than Check Point and Palo Alto Networks.""While F5 is a newer player, I see them as having distribution advantages since they have a broad (sales) channel, large installed base and established credibility,"" Ho said. ""As a smaller company, Imperva has a sole focus on security and a narrower set of products.""

Citrix Systems (CTXS) and Riverbed Technology (RVBD) have gained market share selling software-based, or ""virtual,"" ADCs that run on low-end servers in data centers. In the hardware ADC market, F5 also competes with A10 Networks (ATEN), which went public in March, as well as Radware (RDWR).
"
516,CTXS,"One big rival, Cisco Systems (CSCO), exited the ADC market in late 2012. While Cisco has steered its customers to Citrix, F5 has offered Cisco customers special deals, including trade-in credits, to buy ADCs.
"
517,CTXS,"F5 has also rolled out bigger, more advanced versions of its ADCs. F5's electronic boxes cost from $50,000 to $300,000, depending on how many servers and how much traffic they handle.

518,CTXS,"""It took a while, but the product cycle appears to be kicking into gear for F5,"" said RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Sue, who says that replacement of Cisco ADCs boosted F5's fiscal Q2 results.

522,CTXS,"In fiscal Q2, F5 reported winning major security deals from a large telecom company and a financial services company.

523,CTXS,"Still, some analysts are cautious, given slowing corporate IT spending. F5's federal government sales are a concern.

524,CTXS,"UBS analyst Amitabh Passi, who has a neutral rating on the stock, forecasts revenue growth as moderate to ""low double digits"" by fiscal Q4. Nomura analyst Stuart Jeffrey, who also has a neutral rating, expects growth as moderate to ""lower teens"" in 2015 and 2016.
"
525,CTXS,"One worry for IT companies in general and ADC suppliers in particular is that customers such as Facebook (FB) and Google (GOOGL) are building warehouse-sized data centers using their own computing architectures. The Internet companies aim to use low-cost, ""white box"" servers, open-source software and new technologies such as SDN.
"
526,CTXS,"And Internet cloud-data centers have been designed with ""in-house load balancing solutions"" that direct data traffic to server farms, rather than more costly, branded ADC hardware from F5 and others, Gelblum says.

527,CTXS,"But F5's push into security could give it a bigger role in data centers as threats mount for government agencies, e-commerce sites and financial services, says Deutsche Bank analyst Brian Modoff.F5 Networks is hiring. That's a good sign for a company whose growth slowed markedly in 2013.The company added 115 new employees in fiscal Q2 and expects to hire another 100-plus this quarter. Many are salespeople.""We're hiring because we are seeing demand overall as an opportunity,"" John McAdam, the data center gear maker's CEO, said during a fiscal Q2 earnings call on April 23. ""I think you'll see us doing (more hiring) in the future because it would be crazy not to do that.""In the quarter ended March 30, Seattle-based F5 Networks (FFIV) posted its best quarterly revenue growth in two years as sales rose nearly 20% to $420 million.F5's core business involves Web traffic management. It sells application delivery controllers (ADCs) that direct data traffic to computer servers. ADCs optimize server workloads in corporate and telecom data centers, helping to speed up websites and communications networks.""After a weak 2013, the application delivery market appears to be staging a comeback,"" Citigroup analyst Ehud Gelblum said in a report.The ADC market was flat in 2013 at almost $1.6 billion, though F5's sales rose 8%, says Citigroup. It estimates that the ADC market will grow 12% on average from 2014 to 2017. F5 holds more than 40% of the market for hardware-based ADCs, analysts say.While F5 is the biggest maker of ADCs, competition has intensified.

529,CTXS,"Sanjay Poonen likes to move fast.
"
530,CTXS,"Since joining VMware as general manager of the company's end-user computing group in August, Poonen has overseen a flurry of developments. He helped roll out a new version of the company's desktop virtualization software and helped the company jump into the mobile management service market with an intent to buy AirWatch, a mobile management service company, in January for $1.54 billion.
"
531,CTXS,"Poonen joined VMware (VMW), the world's top maker of virtualization software, after serving as president of the mobile division for SAP (SAP), a global multibillion dollar enterprise software company.
"
532,CTXS,"He recently met with IBD to discuss the company's new initiatives.
"
533,CTXS,"IBD: VMware is the leader in virtualization software for servers, which lets companies save money by running multiple applications on one server. What's the difference between that and desktop virtualization software?
"
534,CTXS,"Poonen: Imagine you have 10 half-full glasses of water and you pour all that water into one big jug and then pour it out as people need it. That is what you do with server virtualization. You avoid buying half-empty servers. You have a single server and you virtualize processes inside that. So you have saved on hardware. That's the principle of server virtualization.
"
535,CTXS,"It's the same thing with a desktop. Rather than install software on every person's desktop, you put this in for thousands of people across the world.
"
536,CTXS,"You can put a lot of computational power on the server, and it works really fast. That is the essence and principal of desktop virtualization.
"
537,CTXS,"You don't have to have this software on your desktop or laptop.
"
538,CTXS,"The other issue is security breaches. The less data you have on there, the more you can control from the server, but you don't have to give up the ease of use that people want.
"
539,CTXS,"IBD: VMware launched a new version of its desktop virtualization software in April. How does it differ from last year's version?
"
540,CTXS,"Poonen: The industry has been looking for a unified approach to roll out (software applications to) desktops. Our new product brings desktop virtualization and application delivery in one unified platform. It's a new way to drive adoption.
"
541,CTXS,"IBD: Who are VMware's rivals in desktop virtualization?
"
542,CTXS,"Poonen: We were a late bloomer in desktop virtualization (started in 2007). Citrix Systems (CTXS) has been in that space, but they have kind of sputtered in their growth and innovation. We are the newer kid on the block with a more innovative, modern approach.
"
543,CTXS,"IBD: Why acquire Desktone, a leading producer of desktop-as-a-service software, in October?
"
544,CTXS,"Poonen: My first priority (at VMware) was to make an innovative play into cloud computing for desktops. That is desktop-as-a-service. Desktone had built their entire stack on our technology. They are the leaders and coined the term desktop-as-a-service. It's for business users who want access to their data, apps and content anywhere, anytime.
"
545,CTXS,"It's just like accessing Google Gmail. You go to a (website) and get your mail. It's $35 per user per month, practically $1 per day. It's cheaper than the price of coffee.
"
546,CTXS,"IBD: Is DaaS the same as cloud-based computing, which lets companies store and access data over the Internet?
"
547,CTXS,"Poonen: Cloud computing is the notion of doing everything as a service, not in your data centers, but in the private and public cloud. Desktop-as-a-service is the same concept for desktops and applications. So rather than having all of your software installed, you go to a (website) and get all of your desktop applications.
"
548,CTXS,"IBD: Does VMware have any DaaS rivals?
"
549,CTXS,"Poonen: Amazon.com (AMZN) announced their WorkSpaces product a month after (VMware acquired Desktone). So as they say, imitation is the best form of flattery. It's nice when a large vendor endorses our vision of desktop-as-a-service. Most of what we have seen of their product will play in the lower end of the market. It's priced the same, but it's significantly less in functionality.
"
550,CTXS,"In December, Cisco Systems (CSCO) launched its desktop-as-a-service offering. It's a revamped branding and reoffering of Desktone.
"
551,CTXS,"Cisco is a strategic partner. In February, we announced a strategic partnership with Google (GOOGL). Its Chromebook is layered with Desktone's desktop-as-a-service, so we have tremendous momentum on our own and with leading partners.
"
552,CTXS,"IBD: Why buy AirWatch?
"
553,CTXS,"Poonen:: It's important to be where the world of end users is going. We had a really good cloud computing story with data centers and desktop-as-a-service, but we didn't have a mobile story.
"
554,CTXS,"We were winning desktop (virtualization) deals at an increasing pace against Citrix, but AirWatch was running away with mobile deals.

615,CTXS,"Dividends have been the consistent source of income for investors seeking regular returns during both bull and bear markets. According to a study, dividends accounted for an average 52% of the total returns over the past seven decades.This is especially true as these stocks offer the best of both these worlds — safety in the form of payouts and stability in the form of mature companies that are less volatile to large swings in stock prices. The companies that offer dividends generally act as a hedge against economic uncertainty and provide downside protection by offering outsized payouts or sizable yields on a regular basis (see: all the Large Cap ETFs here).Q2 Dividends Payout Hits Record Overall, the S&P 500 companies declared a record $124 billion in dividend payouts during the second quarter, up 11% from $112 billion in the year-ago quarter. About 89 firms hiked their payouts versus 67 firms a year ago, while 332 have maintained their dividends versus 347 in the same period last year. Notably, 43 companies have retained the ‘aristocrat’ status of 25 years of consecutive dividend raises. This is primarily thanks to a strong economy, solid earnings, historic tax cuts and results from the second round of Federal Reserve stress tests.Among the special attractions were Citrix Systems (CTXS  -  Free Report), which declared a dividend for the first time with a payout of 35 cents, and Dr Pepper Snapple , which announced a special dividend of $103.75 due to merger activity. Lam Research (LRCX  -  Free Report), Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE  -  Free Report), Wynn Resorts (WYNN  -  Free Report), Ralph Lauren (RL  -  Free Report) and Starbucks (SBUX  -  Free Report) were among the firms that hiked dividend payouts (read: 4 Dividend Growth ETFs to Watch as Global Dividends Top).The trend is expected to continue in the coming months as most large companies have huge cash piles on their balance sheet and are in a position to increase payouts to shareholders. Additionally, the new tax law encourages the companies to bring their overseas cash back home at much more reduced rates and distribute parts of it to their shareholders. Per Bloomberg, an additional 75 companies will boost dividend payouts this quarter.Investors should also note that a company which consistently increases its dividend has stronger fundamentals, suggesting rising cash flows, good liquidity and a strong balance sheet.How to PlayGiven this, investors could tap growing dividends in the form of ETFs. Below, we have highlighted five popular dividend ETFs that offer excellent dividend growth potential, any of which could be a solid pick for investor in the long term: Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF (VIG  -  Free Report)This is the largest and most popular ETF in the dividend space with AUM of $27.8 billion and average daily volume of about 797,000 shares. The fund follows the NASDAQ US Dividend Achievers Select Index, which is composed of high quality stocks that have a record of raising dividend every year. It holds 182 securities in the basket, with none accounting for more than 4.3% share. The fund charges 8 bps in annual fees and has a Zacks ETF Rank #3 (Hold) with a Medium risk outlook (read: Tariff Threats Become Reality, Add 6 ETFs to Your Arsenal).iShares Select Dividend ETF (DVY  -  Free Report)This fund provides exposure to the high dividend-paying U.S. equities with a 5-year history of dividend growth. It follows the Dow Jones U.S. Select Dividend Index and holds 99 securities in its basket with each accounting for less than 2.4% of assets. The ETF has AUM of $17.1 billion and average daily volume of more than 716,000 shares. It charges 39 bps in fees per year from investors and has a Zacks ETF Rank #3 with a Medium risk outlook.SPDR S&P Dividend ETF (SDY  -  Free Report) With AUM of $15.6 billion and average daily volume of 548,000 shares, this fund provides a well-diversified exposure to 112 U.S. stocks that have been consistently increasing their dividends every year for at least 20 years. This can be done by tracking the S&P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats Index. Each firm accounts for less than 2.3% of assets. The fund charges 35 bps in fees and has a Zacks ETF Rank #3 with a Medium risk outlook.Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (SCHD  -  Free Report)With AUM of $7.5 billion, this product offers exposure to the 105 high-dividend yielding U.S. companies that have a record of consistent dividend payments supported by fundamental strength based on financial ratios and ample liquidity. This can be easily done by tracking the Dow Jones U.S. Dividend 100 Index. The fund is well spread across components, with none holding more than 4.81% of assets. It charges 7 bps in annual fees and trades in solid volume of more than 1 million shares a day. It has a Zacks ETF Rank #2 (Buy) with a Medium risk outlook.iShares Core Dividend Growth ETF (DGRO  -  Free Report)This fund provides exposure to companies having a history of consistently growing dividends by tracking the Morningstar US Dividend Growth Index.

The courses will include designing, deploying, administering and managing HPE servers, data centers and converged systems among others.Arrow Electronics with the assistance of the resources from HPE looks to educate customers with the knowledge related to HPE’s host of products and solutions, that will in turn be positively impacting the profit margin of the customers.We believe the collaboration with HPE will be beneficial for Arrow as the latter will be introduced to the vast customer base of HPE, part of which might be interested in Arrow Electronics’ electronic components and enterprise computing products.Hence, this partnership is anticipated to assist Arrow Electronics in expanding its customer base, which will eventually boost its top line in the long run. Notably, in first-quarter 2018, the company’s revenues were up 14.4% on an adjusted basis to $6.876 million.Arrow Electronics, Inc. Revenue (TTM) Arrow Electronics, Inc.

617,CTXS,"Synopsys, Inc. (SNPS  -  Free Report) recently announced that a host of its solutions has been selected by Arbe Robotics for its patented imaging radar meant for advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous vehicles.Arbe Robotics’ imaging radar has a high resolution and offers a “wide 100-degree field of view” even in difficult conditions such as heavy rains, fog or extreme darkness. The chipset is enabled to support safe autonomous driving level 4 and 5 via capturing a detailed image of the size, location and speed of any object within a range of 300 meters of the vehicle.The company has adopted Synopsys’ “DesignWare ARC EM Safety Island, EV6x Embedded Vision Processor with Safety Enhancement Package (SEP), Ethernet Quality-of-Service (QoS) Controller IP, STAR Memory System, STAR Hierarchical System and STAR ECC Compiler for its new 4D high-resolution imaging radar system-on-chip (SoC).”The ASIL D Ready features of Synopsys’ IP are suitable for the strict safety requirements of ADAS. Additionally, “safety documentation, including failure modes, effects, and diagnostic analysis (FMEDA) reports” are anticipated to quicken the pace of the chip’s ISO 26262 Certification.Notably, in May, Synopsys unveiled the industry’s first ASIL D Ready embedded vision processor IP for applications in ADAS and autonomous vehicles. It provides critical hardware features for safety along with maintenance of high performance. We believe this will provide the company with first mover’s advantage in the market, eventually driving revenues.Synopsys, Inc. Revenue (TTM) Synopsys, Inc. Revenue (TTM) | Synopsys, Inc. QuoteSafety First for ADASDiscussions regarding ADAS and autonomous vehicles often veer toward the reliability and safety-oriented issues of the vehicles. In March, one of Uber Technologies’ autonomous vehicles killed a pedestrian in Arizona, while undergoing test driving.Following this incident, the governor of Arizona suspended Uber from test driving autonomous cars in the state for an indefinite period. Reportedly, this mishap led NVIDIA (NVDA  -  Free Report), the manufacturer of hardware for Uber’s technology, to stop testing of its own self-driving vehicles on roads.Notably, NVIDIA is currently using NVIDIA DRIVE Constellation, a virtual reality (VR) based autonomous vehicle simulator that enables the virtual testing of autonomous vehicles in diverse conditions. Hence, safety remains a major concern for the companies dealing with autonomous driving and ADAS.Synopsys’ IP solutions are equipped with self-checking safety monitor, error correcting code (ECC) and programmable watchdog timer. Also, the lockstep feature enables rapid detection of runtime faults and system failures and addresses the need for real-time networking between the connected devices.We believe that such initiatives on Synopsys’ part will eventually increase its client bases, thereby boosting its top line in the long run. These will also aid the company in competing against peers like Cadence Design Systems Inc (CDNS  -  Free Report).Zacks Rank and Stock to ConsiderSynopsys currently has a Zacks Rank#3 (Hold).A better-ranked technology stock is Citrix Systems, Inc.

618,CTXS,"Synopsys, Inc. (SNPS  -  Free Report) has been gaining from recent product launches, client acquisitions and buyouts. The company has an average trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 7.8%.With expected long-term earnings per share growth rate of 10% and a current market cap of $13.3 billion, it seems to be a stock that investors should retain in their portfolio right now.Let’s take a look at the factors aiding the company’s performance.Increased adoption of Synopsys’ products, as well as strength in hardware segment and IP are aiding the company’s growth, as evident from its second-quarter fiscal 2018 revenues that jumped 14.2% year over year to $776.8 million.Synopsys, Inc. Revenue (TTM) Synopsys, Inc. Revenue (TTM) | Synopsys, Inc. Quote Notably, the company is gaining traction from acquisitions. In January 2018, Synopsys acquired Kilopass Technology, a provider of one-time programmable (OTP) non-volatile memory (NVM) IP with applications in automotive, mobile, industrial and Internet of Things (IoT) areas. The buyout is expected to help Synopsys in offering a wide portfolio of efficient IP solutions.Synopsys is also reaping the benefits of acquiring Black Duck Software, a provider of solutions related to security and management of open source software. Black Duck’s brand recognition as well as cross-selling options are proving to be accretive to the company’s top line.Nevertheless, the company’s escalating costs and expenses, which are thwarting margins, make us increasingly cautious about its near-term profitability. Additionally, uncertainty regarding the timeline for realization of acquisition synergies remain headwinds.Moreover, the company faces stiff competition from peers like Cadence Design Systems (CDNS  -  Free Report), which might result in lower prices and profits for Synopsys.Furthermore, the company has customer-concentration risk, as a small number of customers account for significant portion of its revenues. This could be risky, as loss of a single customer could affect its operating performance significantly and thereby jeopardize results.However, Synopsys' improving top line along with shareholder-friendly initiatives like the recent announcement of buying back $165 million worth of common stocks under an accelerated share repurchase (ASR) program make this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock worth retaining in the portfolio.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked technology stocks include The Ultimate Software Group, Inc.

After adjusting for currency impact, revenues increased 32.1% to $183 million.Red Hat stated that strong performance from the emerging technologies was partially offset by moderate growth in middleware offerings. The ongoing transition of workloads, from traditional physical deployments to container environments, was blamed for weakness in middleware growth.Training & services revenues (12.5% of revenues) advanced 27.1% from the year-ago quarter to $102 million. When adjusted for currency impact, revenues increased 24% to $99.6 million.The top-line growth in the services business was primarily driven by strong consulting demand for Ansible and OpenShift.Cross-Selling a Key CatalystRed Hat inked 65 deals worth more than $1 million in the quarter, which increased 48% year over year. Among these deals, 5 were worth more than $5 million. Only one deal was worth more than $10 million.Moreover, the company renewed all of the 25 largest deals at more than 120% of prior deal value.Mid-market deals valued more than $250k increased 138% on a year-over-year basis from 21 deals to 50 deals, with notable growth in Ansible and OpenShift. The partnerships with global systems integrators are a major driver in the mid-market segment.Red Hat’s Linux Container platform, OpenShift, continues to gain strong traction. The platform was selected by more than 100 new customers. Also, median revenue per customer increased in the quarter.Red Hat has expanded its partnership with Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report), which will enable enterprise developers to run container-based applications across both Microsoft Azure and on premise environments.Moreover, the company also extended its collaboration with International Business Machines (IBM  -  Free Report) to combine OpenShift and IBM Cloud Private with a number of IBM’s software and cloud solutions.Further, Ansible crossed 1,000 subscribers in the quarter, up almost 70% year over year.Management noted that 71% of the deals included one or more components from the company’s application development and emerging technologies offerings. Top verticals within the deals greater than $1 million were other mainstream sectors such as healthcare, hospitality and transportation.

Management authorized a new program worth $1 billion that replaces the old program, under which the company had spent $751 million worth of shares.At the end of the first quarter, total deferred revenue balance was $2.4 billion, up 19% year over year.GuidanceFor fiscal 2019, Red Hat forecasts revenues in the range of approximately $3.375-$3.410 billion, down from previous guidance range of $3.425-$3.460 billion, primarily due to the negative impact from a strong U.S. dollar.Moreover, weakness in middleware, primarily due to ongoing workload shifting from legacy physical deployments to container environments, is expected to hurt top-line growth this fiscal.Non-GAAP operating margin is anticipated to be 23.9%. Red Hat now expects fiscal non-GAAP earnings between $3.44 and $3.48, better than previous guidance range of $3.38-$3.41 per share. This is primarily due to lower effective tax rate.Operating cash flow is expected to be in a range of $1.035-$1.045 billion.Moving to the second quarter outlook, Red Hat projects revenues in the band of $822-$830 million, while non-GAAP earnings are expected to be 81 cents per share.Non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be 23%.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderRed Hat carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Citrix Systems (CTXS  -  Free Report) is a stock worth considering in the same sector, as it sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

The last few years have witnessed a series of breakthroughs in cloud computing, predictive analysis, artificial intelligence (AI), self-driving vehicles, digital personal assistants and Internet of Things (IoT), consequently setting the stage for strong growth in the software industry.Moreover, continued enterprise investment in big data and analytics along with the ongoing adoption of Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) presents significant growth opportunity for industry players.Notably, the cloud offers a flexible and cost-effective platform to develop and test new applications and the deployment time is also much shorter as compared with legacy systems.Additionally, the increasing need to secure cloud platforms, amid growing incidences of cyber attacks and hacking, continues to drive demand for cyber security software.Further, as enterprises continue to move their on-premise workload to cloud environments (emergence of hybrid cloud), application and infrastructure monitoring have gained utmost importance. This is creating more demand for performance management monitoring tools that are not only scalable but also suitable for cloud-based environments.Industry Returns PositiveRobust demand for software and continuing innovations have been the key catalysts to consistent earnings and impressive sales growth. These are mainly behind investor confidence instilled in the Computer Software industry’s growth prospects.The Zacks Computer Software Industry, within the broader Zacks Computer And Technology Sector, has outperformed both the S&P 500 and its own sector over the past year.One-Year Price PerformanceWhile the stocks in this industry have collectively gained 34.1%, the Zacks S&P 500 Composite and Zacks Computer And Technology Sector have rallied 13.7% and 19.2%, respectively.We believe the near-term growth prospects are bright given increased spending by enterprises on software procurement.Stretched Valuation a ConcernHowever, the Computer Software industry’s valuation looks stretched at the moment. One might get a good sense of the industry’s relative valuation by looking at its price-to-earnings ratio (P/E), which essentially shows how much an investor is willing to pay for each unit of earnings.Notably, a lower P/E ratio is always better.The industry currently has a forward 12-month P/E ratio of 26.65, which is close to the highest level over the past year.The space also looks expensive when compared with the market at large, as the forward 12-month P/E ratio for the S&P 500 is 17.14 and the median level is 18.28.Price-to-Earnings Ratio (F12M) Moreover, a comparison of the group’s P/E ratio with that of its border sector ensures that the group is trading at a huge premium. The Zacks Computer And Technology Sector’s forward 12-month P/E ratio of 19.71 and the median level of 20.50 for the same period are way below the Zacks Computer Software Industry’s respective ratios.Price-to-Earnings Ratio (F12M) Improving Earnings Outlook to Drive OutperformanceNevertheless, strong industry fundamentals and expectations of solid top-line growth should help Computer Software stocks continue generating positive shareholder returns in the near future.Investors would also be eager to watch whether this group has the potential to perform better than the broader market in the quarters ahead. One reliable measure that can help investors understand the industry’s prospects is the earnings outlook for its member companies. Empirical research shows that a company’s earnings outlook significantly influences the performance of its stock.One could get a good sense of a company’s earnings outlook by comparing the consensus earnings expectation for the current financial year with the last year’s reported number, but an effective measure could be the magnitude and direction of the recent change in earnings estimates.The consensus earnings estimate for the Zacks Computer Software industry of $3.13 per share reflects solid year-over-year improvement. Moreover, the trend in earnings estimates revisions have been favorable of late.Price and Consensus: Zacks Computer Software IndustryLooking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are gaining confidence in this group’s earnings potential.The consensus EPS estimate for the current fiscal year has been revised 2.6% upward since Mar 31, 2018.Current Fiscal Year EPS Estimate Revisions Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Solid ProspectsThe group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates continued outperformance in the near term.The Zacks Computer Software industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #63, which places it at the top 25% of more than 256 Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Our proprietary Heat Map shows that the industry’s rank has continuously improved over the past five weeks.Long-Term Growth Prospects StrongThe long-term (3-5 years) EPS growth estimate for the Zacks Computer Software industry appears promising. The group’s mean estimate of long-term EPS growth rate has remained steady since March 2018 to reach the current level of 11.89%. This compares to 9.8% for the Zacks S&P 500 composite.Mean Estimate of Long-Term EPS Growth Rate Computer Software’s long-term growth prospects are alluring. Growing adoption of hybrid cloud computing models, rapid usage of AI and machine learning tools, the proliferation of wearables & self-driving vehicles and increasing automation of the application development process bode well for the industry.Moreover, the growing usage of Internet of Things (IoT) at home, in office, for cars and every other conceivable place is also an incredible business driver. These factors are expected to drive top-line growth that has gained significant momentum since the end of 2016.  Moreover, another indication of solid long-term prospects is the improvement in the group’s gross margin. Bottom LineThe role of software is evolving. Apart from running devices and applications, its usage is expanding in managing infrastructure. Moreover, the industry is significantly benefiting from the ongoing cloud transition.SaaS companies are expected to register strong top-line growth due to a higher percentage of recurring revenues, subscription gross margin and a lower churn rate. Moreover, strong spending by enterprises is a positive.Moreover, software companies are poised to benefit the most from Trump's repatriation policy. This enhanced liquidity is expected to boost their appetite for strategic acquisitions.Despite stretched valuations, investors can build positions in the Computer Software industry based on the above-mentioned factors as well as strong earnings outlook.Here, we list four stocks that have been witnessing positive earnings estimate revisions and carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).(You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.)ANSYS, Inc. (ANSS  -  Free Report): The stock of this Pittsburgh, PA-based engineering simulation software and services provider has jumped 45.1% over the past year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current-year EPS has increased 1.9% over the last 60 days.Price and Consensus: ANSS Citrix Systems, Inc. (CTXS  -  Free Report): The consensus EPS estimate for this Fort Lauderdale-based virtualization, networking and cloud computing solutions provider has moved 8.2% higher for the current year, over the last 60 days. The stock has rallied 32.4% over the past year.Price and Consensus: CTXS Cadence Design Systems, Inc. (CDNS  -  Free Report): The stock of this San Jose-based electronic product designing solutions provider has jumped 31.8% over the past year. The consensus EPS estimate for the current year has been revised 3.8% upward over the last 60 days.Price and Consensus: CDNS Adobe Systems, Inc. (ADBE  -  Free Report): The stock of this San Jose, CA-based software solutions provider has gained 77.9% over the past year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current-year EPS has been revised 3.6% upward over the last 60 days.Price and Consensus: ADBE Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geopolitics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks Research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

621,CTXS,"Shares of Intuit Inc. (INTU  -  Free Report) have been gaining solid momentum, of late, and even crafted a 52-week high of $210.85 yesterday. One of the major reasons behind this could be the company’s outstanding third-quarter fiscal 2018 results. Also, encouraging fourth-quarter and full-fiscal outlook drove its shares higher.Notably, the company has gained approximately 10.5% since it reported fiscal third-quarter results on May 22. The stock has outperformed its industry in the year-to-date period. Intuit has rallied 32.6% in the said period, while the industry has gained 17%.The company’s results in the last reported quarter benefited from a number of reasons. Management was particularly positive about a successful tax season backed by performance of the DIY category and higher average revenue per return. The company also managed to gain some additional share in the DIY market. Additionally, the shift in its product mix toward the higher end of the company’s product line was also a positive.Intuit has an impressive earnings surprise history, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 37.8%. Backed by the impressive results, the company issued upbeat outlook for the fourth quarter and full fiscal.Factors Driving Intuit’s Robust Quarterly PerformancesThe company has two main products — QuickBooks which offer financial and business management online services and desktop software to small businesses, and TurboTax which offers income-tax preparation products and services. Notably, Intuit has been witnessing solid year-over-year growth for the past several quarters in its QuickBooks subscriber base, which is driving Small Business segment revenues.It should be noted that about 29 million small businesses in the United States depend on third-party companies to deal with their financial and accounting related preparation. With its rich product portfolio, Intuit has capitalized well on this opportunity which is well reflected in its previous quarterly results.For fiscal 2018, the company expects QuickBooks online subscriber base of 3.27-3.37 million. Per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, the company will end the fiscal fourth quarter with a subscriber base of 3.223 million, marking 45.2% year-over-year improvement.The year-over-year increase in online subscriber base will continue to drive revenues, going forward. The innovative features being launched by the company will also aid the top line.The company’s Consumer Tax segment revenue has been benefiting from strong adoption of its Turbo Tax products.Intuit’s continued focus on bringing in innovative and easy-to-use TurboTax products for different users has helped it add new customers. The company, during the last earnings conference call, stated that its TurboTax Live offering witnessed success in the first season and is likely to be accretive to the company’s Consumer business, moving ahead.The recently-launched Turbo offering that provides a snapshot of a user’s financial health also witnessed healthy adoption, which is yet another catalyst for expansion of the company’s business beyond tax.Furthermore, its TurboTax products derive high margins which are likely to cushion Intuit’s bottom-line results.A Buy Rated StockIntuit carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and flaunts a VGM Style Score of A. We note that our VGM score highlights the determining elements in a stock that can push the stock price higher. We can essentially filter out the negatives and focus on the positives which drive its price.Consequently, we believe the stock has huge potential to surge higher and therefore, investors should consider it for near-term opportunities.Some Other Stocks Worth ConsideringSome other top-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are Adobe Systems Incorporated (ADBE  -  Free Report), Cadence Design Systems, Inc. (CDNS  -  Free Report) and Citrix Systems, Inc. (CTXS  -  Free Report), all sporting a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The long-term expected EPS growth rates for Adobe, Cadence Design and Citrix Systems are 16.2%, 12% and 9.1%.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 19X over. Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we're willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation.See Them Free>>

622,CTXS,"Liquidity of a stock is an important yardstick that investors often ignore. It primarily indicates a company’s capability to meet debt obligations by converting assets into liquid cash and equivalents.These stocks have always been in demand due to their potential to provide maximum returns. However, one should exercise caution before investing in such stocks. While a high liquidity level may imply that a company is meeting its obligations at a faster rate than its peers, it may also indicate that the company is failing to use its assets efficiently.Hence, one may consider the efficiency level of a company in addition to its liquidity to identify potential winners.Measures to Identify Liquid StocksCurrent Ratio: It measures current assets relative to current liabilities. This ratio is used for measuring a company’s potential to meet both short- and long-term debt obligations. Thus, a current ratio — also known as working capital ratio — below 1 indicates that the company has more liabilities than assets. However, a high current ratio does not always indicate that the company is in good financial shape. It may also mean that the company has failed to utilize its assets significantly. Hence, a range of 1 to 3 is considered ideal.Quick Ratio: Unlike current ratio, quick ratio – also called “acid-test ratio"" or ""quick assets ratio"" – indicates a company’s ability to pay short-term obligations. It considers inventory excluding current assets relative to current liabilities. Like the current ratio, a quick ratio of greater than 1 is desirable.Cash Ratio: This is the most conservative ratio among the three, as it takes into account only cash and cash equivalents, and invested funds relative to current liabilities. It measures a company’s ability to meet its current debt obligations using the most liquid of assets. Though a cash ratio higher than 1 may point to sound financials, a higher number may indicate inefficiency in cash utilization.So, a ratio greater than 1 is desirable at all times but may not always appropriately represent a company’s financial condition.Screening ParametersIn order to pick the best of the lot, we have added asset utilization, which is a widely used measure of a company’s efficiency, as one of the screening criteria. Asset utilization is the ratio of total sales over the past 12 months to the last four-quarter average of total assets. Though this ratio varies across industries, companies with a ratio higher than their respective industries can be considered efficient.In order to ensure that these liquid and efficient stocks have solid growth potential, we have added our proprietary Growth Style Score to the screen.Current Ratio, Quick Ratio and Cash Ratio between 1 and 3 (While liquidity ratios of greater than 1 are desirable, significantly high ratios may indicate inefficiency.)Asset utilization greater than industry average (Higher asset utilization than the industry average indicates a company’s efficiency.)Zacks Rank equal to #1 (Only Strong Buy-rated stocks can get through). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.  Growth Score less than or equal to B (Back-tested results show that stocks with a Growth Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 handily beat other stocks.)These criteria have narrowed down the universe of over 7,700 stocks to only 11.Here are five of the 11 stocks that qualified the screen:Sunnyvale, CA-based Mellanox Technologies Ltd. (MLNX  -  Free Report) is a leading supplier of semiconductor-based, interconnect products to world-class server, storage, and infrastructure OEMs servicing Fortune 500 data centers, the world's most powerful supercomputers, and mission critical embedded applications.

624,CTXS,"Have you been paying attention to shares of Intuit (INTU  -  Free Report)? Shares have been on the move with the stock up 10.2% over the past month. INTU hit a new 52-week high of $210.13 in the previous session. Intuit has gained 32.5% since the start of the year compared to the 9.8% move for the Computer and Technology sector and the 18.3% year-to-date return for its peer group.What's Driving the Outperformance?The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises, having beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on May 22, 2018, Intuit reported EPS of $4.82 versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.67 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 2.91%.For the current fiscal year, Intuit is expected to post earnings of $5.53 per share on $5.93 billion in revenues. This represents a 25.4% change in EPS on a 14.51% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $6.52 per share on $6.51 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 17.96% and 9.88%, respectively.Valuation MetricsIntuit may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for INTU? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.Intuit has a Value Score of D. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are A and B, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of A.In terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 37.8X current fiscal year EPS estimates. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 44X versus its peer group's average of 25.6X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 2.33. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.Intuit Inc. Price and Consensus  Intuit Inc. Price and Consensus | Intuit Inc. QuoteZacks RankWe also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Intuit currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Intuit passes the test. Thus, it seems as though INTU shares could still be poised for more gains ahead.How Does Intuit Stack Up to the Competition?Shares of Intuit have been soaring, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? Some of its industry peers are also looking good, including Sapiens International Corporation N.V. (SPNS  -  Free Report), Verint Systems (VRNT  -  Free Report), and Citrix Systems (CTXS  -  Free Report), all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least #2 and a VGM Score of at least B, making them well-rounded choices.The Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 19% of all the industries we have in our universe, so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for INTU, even beyond its own solid fundamental situation.

626,CTXS,"Last week, Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) announced that it was buying GitHub, checking the feasibility of an underwater data center and exciting new stuff at the electronic entertainment expo. Here are the details-The Huge GitHub PurchaseMicrosoft’s $7.5 billion GitHub purchase is a very big deal because open source prospects have increased hugely in the last few years. And GitHub is the platform hosting the largest open source community of 20 million members with its storage, collaboration and communication tools.The platform functions through three processes: forking, which allows any user to copy a repository to his own account to develop the idea (GitHub has 57 million repositories); pull request, which is a request to the original owner to accept the change if desired; and merge, which allows the owner to accept the change by the click of a button after also checking the member’s credentials and past work done on the platform.GitHub charges through a subscription model that includes unlimited public repositories for all plans. Private repositories cost $7, $12, $22 and $50 a month for Micro, Small, Medium and Large plans including 5, 10, 20 and 50 private repositories, respectively (for individuals). Teams are charged $25, $50, $100 and $200 for Bronze, Silver, Gold and Platinum plans that include 10, 20, 100 and 200 repositories, respectively. Users can add additional storage and bandwidth, each at $5 for a 50 GB pack.Businesses are charged $21 per user per month. GitHub Enterprise (hosted on a company’s own servers, AWS, Azure, or GCP) starts at $2,100 per 10-user seat pack per year, which includes maintenance, upgrades and technical support at no extra cost. And still, GitHub has yet to make a profit, which is why it needs a bigger partner that can provide it with funds and additional resources, while also helping it to market the business and enterprise segments.That’s where Microsoft comes in with its deep pockets, huge sales team and enterprise focus. CEO Satya Nadella was very clear about the rationale for the deal. He said that software was increasingly getting into non technological sectors at an unprecedented rate such that these sectors were hiring 25% more developers than the technology sector.Microsoft wanted to capitalize on this trend. It isn’t hard to understand that these people would need a platform on which to communicate and collaborate. Microsoft could merge some of its tools into the GitHub platform and market them jointly to its huge enterprise customer base.There are some trust issues as some older developers remember Microsoft’s past, when it was the bitterest critic of the open source platform and used its might to ensure that its own paid platform continued to dominate. But as the new GitHub CEO Nat Friedman has said, the company is determined to regain that trust. As developers understand that the success of the acquisition depends on its remaining open source and as independent as it is today, these problems will be automatically resolved.The Second Underwater Data CenterMicrosoft is sinking a data center called Northern Isles into the North Sea off the Scottish coastline in an attempt to lower cooling costs in the second phase of trials as part of what it calls Project Natick. Natick is a research project studying the efficiency of data centers. In the first phase, a smaller data center was put on the sea floor off the California coast for 105 days with the goal of seeing whether it was possible to operate such a submerged data center.In this phase, Microsoft is going to study the logistics and cost of operating such a data center, as well as its impact on the environment, including the effect of heating up the waters and disturbing surrounding wildlife. A data center uses just 2% of the energy it receives with the rest dissipated as heat that because of its nature, can’t be transported or put to other use.The experimental data center is medium sized at 12.2 meters in length and 3.18 meters in diameter, containing 12 racks housing 864 servers. It has a capacity of 27.6 petabytes, which Microsoft says is as much storage space as five million movies and packing as much power as thousands of high-end PCs.

627,CTXS,"If you are still holding on to shares of Symantec Corporation (SYMC  -  Free Report) in your portfolio, it is time you dump those as chances of favorable returns in the near term appear bleak.Similar to wise buying decisions, offloading certain underperformers at the right time helps maximize portfolio returns. Symantec has witnessed a significant price decline in the year-to-date period, and negative earnings estimate revisions for the current quarter and the fiscal. Further, the company’s Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) only reflects its innate weakness.Notably, the stock has lost 24.4% of its value in the year-to-date period, substantially underperforming the 17% rally of its industry it belongs to.Let’s take a look at factors behind this plunge.Investigation Woes Pulling Share Price DownThe plunge particularly came after the company, during the fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 earnings conference call, reported that its board’s audit committee is making an internal investigation into the concerns voiced by an ex-employee. The company did not divulge details on the nature of the investigation, however, Symantec stated that it isn’t related to any security breach or concern regarding products and systems.Lack of clarity on the probe announced, along with executives’ refusal to take questions post the earnings conference call, has resulted in a plunge of more than 27% in Symantec’s shares since May 10 to till day.Later, on May 14, this cyber-security provider held another press meet and stated that the probe relates to the reporting of certain non-GAAP accounting measures, which includes executive compensation too, public disclosures including commentary on the company’s historical financial results, certain forward-looking statements, stock trading plans and retaliation.We believe this information is inadequate to gain investors’ confidence. The ongoing investigation may throw light on some serious issues which might severely cost the company in the near future. Therefore, it is wise to wait and watch for some time for better visibility of the stock.Dismal Outlook Dims Near-Term ProspectsSymantec’s weaker-than-expected outlook for the first quarter as well as fiscal 2019 makes investors cautious about its near-term performance. Also, the company expects non-GAAP operating margin for fiscal 2019 in the range of 30-32%, which reflects a substantial decline from the fiscal 2018 level of 34.7%. The reduction in margins is mainly due to continued shift of business model to ratable revenues, and increased investment in sales and marketing capacity.Downward Estimate RevisionFollowing the company’s fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 results and investigation revelation, the stock has witnessed sharp downward estimate revision. For fiscal 2019, we have seen 14 estimates moving south in the past 60 days. This trend has caused the consensus estimate to trend downward from $1.82 to $1.57.Additionally, for the current quarter, Symantec has seen 11 downward estimate revisions, dragging the consensus estimate down to 33 cents per share from 41 cents per share, in the past 60 days.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the computer-software industry space are Cadence Design Systems, Inc. (CDNS  -  Free Report), Aspen Technology, Inc. (AZPN  -  Free Report) and Citrix Systems, Inc. (CTXS  -  Free Report), all sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

630,CTXS,"SAP SE (SAP  -  Free Report) is one technology company that continues to display strength in several areas. Adding the stock to your portfolio should not be a disappointment. Shares of the enterprise-application software provider have gained 7.2% over the past year, outperforming the 5.9% growth of its industry.Earnings estimates for SAP have exhibited an uptrend, reflecting optimism in the stock’s prospects.

Let us delve deeper into the other factors that make this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock a lucrative pick. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.What Makes the Stock an Attractive Pick?Q1 Results, Upbeat GuidanceSAP reported first-quarter 2018 IFRS earnings per share of €0.59 (71 cents), reflecting a surge of 37% on a year-over-year basis. The year-over-year improvement can primarily be attributed to a notable increase in operating profit.Total revenues, on IFRS basis, for the quarter were €5.26 billion ($6.42 billion), almost flat year over year. A flourishing cloud business, along with robust improvement of support revenues, aided top-line growth during the quarter.New cloud bookings — a key indicator of sales success in cloud business — were up an impressive 25% (at constant currency) to €245 million in the reported quarter. The company's customer experience solutions witnessed triple digit year-over-year growth in new cloud bookings. During the quarter, Jaguar Land Rover, Coca-Cola, and Unilever were added to SAP's customer experience solutions client base.On the back of the completion of the acquisition of Callidus Software and stellar operating profits recorded in the first quarter, SAP raised guidance for 2018. The company anticipates non-IFRS total revenues to come in the range of €24.8-€25.3 billion at constant currency (cc), up from the previous range of range of €24.6-€25.1 billion. This represents growth of 5.5-7.5% year over year. The contribution of Callidus Software is expected to be around €200 million.Additionally, non-IFRS operating profit for 2018 is estimated to be in the band of €7.35-€7.5 billion, up from €7.3-€7.5 billion, reflecting year-over-year growth of 8.5-11%. Callidus is expected to provide €10 million.Strong Growth ProspectsThe company’s Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2018 earnings of $5.19 reflects year-over-year growth of 3.4%. Moreover, earnings are expected to register 10.8% improvement in fiscal 2019. The stock has a long-term expected earnings per share growth rate of 7.21%.Valuation Looks RationalThe company currently has a trailing 12-month Price/Earnings (P/E) ratio of 22.08. This is quite low compared with the current P/E for the industry that is pegged at 475.00. Its lower-than-market positioning indicates that there is room for an upside in the quarters ahead.Growth DriversSAP’s Cloud and Software businesses have been consistent growth drivers for quite some time. Impressive growth in S/4HANA and other Cloud initiatives has supported the company’s top line.Its human capital management applications have also added to revenues driven by accelerated adoption of SuccessFactors Employee Central. These are expected to continue being beneficial to the company.SAP concluded the acquisition of Callidus Software Inc. for $2.4 billion, on Apr 5, 2018. The company had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Callidus on Jan 30, 2017.The terms of the deal represent a purchase price of $36 per share. The buyout not only gives SAP access to new sales analytic and customer engagement tools but also bolster its foothold in $46 billion cloud-based customer relationship management (“CRM”) market.SAP anticipates the deal to be neutral to its non-IFRS earnings for 2018 and accretive to 2019 non-IFRS earnings.The company plans to consolidate its vibrant SAP Hybris cloud portfolio, part of its Cloud Business Group with CallidusCloud product assets.With the buyout of Callidus, SAP will boost its strength in front-office and back-office software, consequently increasing operational efficiencies.Other Stocks to ConsiderAmazon.com, Inc.

631,CTXS,"Have you been paying attention to shares of Citrix Systems (CTXS  -  Free Report)? Shares have been on the move with the stock up 1.4% over the past month. CTXS hit a new 52-week high of $108.97 in the previous session. Citrix Systems has gained 23.6% since the start of the year compared to the 9.1% move for the Computer and Technology sector and the 17.7% year-to-date return for its peer group.What's Driving the Outperformance?The stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises, having beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on April 25, 2018, Citrix Systems reported EPS of $1.29 versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.05 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 3.17%.For the current fiscal year, Citrix Systems is expected to post earnings of $5.27 per share on $2.91 billion in revenues. This represents an 8.66% change in EPS on a 3.01% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $5.79 per share on $3.01 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 9.87% and 3.45%, respectively.Valuation MetricsCitrix Systems may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for CTXS? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.Citrix Systems has a Value Score of D. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are B and B, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of B.In terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 20.6X current fiscal year EPS estimates. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 19.5X versus its peer group's average of 25X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 2.28. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.Citrix Systems, Inc. Price and Consensus  Citrix Systems, Inc. Price and Consensus | Citrix Systems, Inc. QuoteZacks RankWe also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Citrix Systems currently has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Citrix Systems fits the bill. Thus, it seems as though CTXS shares could have a bit more room to run in the near term.How Does Citrix Systems Stack Up to the Competition?Shares of Citrix Systems have been moving higher, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? Some of its industry peers are also impressive, including Sapiens International Corporation N.V. (SPNS  -  Free Report), Intuit (INTU  -  Free Report), and CACI International (CACI  -  Free Report), all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least #2 and a VGM Score of at least B, making them well-rounded choices.The Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 26% of all the industries we have in our universe, so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for CTXS, even beyond its own solid fundamental situation.

632,CTXS,"Guidewire Software, Inc. (GWRE  -  Free Report) delivered third-quarter fiscal 2018 non-GAAP earnings of 5 cents per share, comparing favorably with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 1 cent per share. However, it was much lower than the year-ago figure of 16 cents per share.The company posted revenues of $140.5 million, which increased 14% from the year-ago quarter. The figure also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $137 million and was above the guided range. The increase can primarily be attributed to growth in Services revenues and Maintenance revenues.Notably, the company is transforming to a subscription based model from a term license based one, which might hurt the top line in the near term. This is because term license revenues include advance payments while subscription-based revenues are a bit delayed.Nevertheless, management is extremely optimistic about the several cloud-based products launched in the quarter, at a time when the P&C insurance industry is moving steadily toward adoption of cloud solutions.Guidewire stock has gained 35.2% year over year, substantially outperforming the 21.4% rally of the industry it belongs to.Revenue DetailsThe company has three main segments namely Maintenance, License, and Other and Services.Maintenance revenues amounted to $18.7 million, up 11% year over year. Further, the same from Service increased 50% from the year-ago quarter to $71.4 million. However, License and Other revenues decreased 15% from the year-ago quarter to $50.4 million.Management stated that a substantial majority of second-quarter revenues were from subscription based products (accounted for approximately 50% of total revenues). Backed by the strong performance of subscription products, management continues to expect subscription sales in the range of 30-40%, for fiscal 2018.Perpetual revenues in the third quarter came in at $5.7 million. Perpetual licenses revenues are now expected to be approximately $9-$10 million in fiscal 2018 primarily due to new Latin America activity.With regard to maintenance revenues, higher perpetual revenues and the enhanced timing of sales increased the range of this segment to $76-$77 million, up $0.5 million at its mid-point. However, growth of the Maintenance revenues that are part of subscriptions will be negatively impacted while the change in the company’s business model is in progress because of the delayed revenue recognition from the subscription based products.Per management, the license revenues will have a negative impact in fiscal 2018. The sales process might be a bit stretched due to the time taken by customers to choose between on-premise and cloud delivery options. Perpetual license revenues facing a decline will be a further drag to the license and other revenues. Transition to cloud-based subscription sales will also impact license and other revenues.Meanwhile, services revenues were better than expected in the quarter. The segment is anticipated to improve performance in the near term on the back of proper implementation of InsuranceNow.Additionally, management is optimistic about the completion of the Cyence buyout. Notably, Cyence determines the economic impact of a cybercrime via a software platform, which is built on cyber-security related data science. The integration of Cyence would imply that the company would be able to provide an entire life cycle to the insurance products starting from designing to transaction management.Operating DetailsIn third-quarter fiscal 2018, non-GAAP gross profit came in at $77.5 million, down 4% from a year-ago quarter. Non-GAAP gross margin was 55.2% compared with 65.1% in the year-ago quarter. The decrease was owing to higher investments in lower margin services revenues and cloud operations. Further, payment shift of a Tier-1 term customer negatively impacted gross margins.Total non-GAAP operating expenses came in at $75.2 million during the quarter, up 19% year over. The increase can primarily be attributed to higher research and development and sales and marketing expenses along with the recent acquisitions of Cyence and ISCS.Non-GAAP operating margin was 1.6% compared with 13.8% in the year-ago quarter. The marginal decline due to the negative impact of higher mix of low-margin services revenues and shift in investments to the cloud based model.Balance SheetThe company had cash and cash equivalents and investments of $994.3 on Apr 30, 2018 as compared with $569.5 million in the previous quarter.Cash flow from operations in the third quarter was $20.2 million and free cash flow was $19 million.GuidanceFor fourth-quarter fiscal 2018, revenues are expected to be in the range of $234-$240 million. The Zacks Consensus estimate is pegged at $239.6 million. License and other revenues are expected to be in the range of $141-$147 million. Maintenance revenue is anticipated to be in the range of $19-$20 million.  Services revenues are projected to be in the range of $71-$75 million.Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be between $78 million and $84 million, while non-GAAP net income is anticipated to be within $58.8-$63.2 million.Non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be between 72-77 cents. The Zacks Consensus estimate is pegged at 74 cents.Guidewire raised fiscal 2018 guidance. The company now expects total revenues to be in the range of $647-$653 million (previously $644-$650 million band), representing an increase of 26- 27% year over year.

The notes carry an interest rate of 5.875% and will mature on Jun 15, 2026, subject to customary closing conditions.JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, BofA Merrill Lynch, Wells Fargo Securities and a few others are acting as joint book-running managers for the purpose. The offering is made under the company’s shelf registration statement.CDK Global is looking to utilize the net proceeds from the offerings for general corporate purposes, strategic acquisitions and working capital.We believe these notes will provide financial flexibility to the company and propel long-term growth. Nonetheless, escalating interest expenses due to increased debt burden may dampen its profitability.Notably, CDK Global exited third-quarter 2018 with $461.4 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. The company's total debt principal outstanding was $2.09 billion as on Mar 31, 2018. Consequently, raising funds through this public offering will be beneficial for the company.Further, CDK Global expects to improve liquidity and strengthen balance sheet through prudent investment decisions. Moreover, the senior notes offering will lower the company’s cost of capital, consequently strengthening balance sheet and supporting growth.To ConcludeThe company’s share price movement has been quite unfavorable. In the past year, its shares have returned just 5.1%, underperforming the industry’s growth of 31.4%.CDK Global reported mixed third-quarter results and lowered its fiscal 2018 guidance. Although the bottom line managed to surpass the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny, the top line missed the same.The company also reduced fiscal 2018 revenue guidance to 2.5-3% from 3-4%, mainly due to lower-than-expected advertising revenues.  The company also reduced GAAP earnings per share for fiscal 2018 to $2.67-$2.72 per share.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderCDKGlobal currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Aspen Technology, Inc. (AZPN  -  Free Report), NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report) and Citrix Systems, Inc. (CTXS  -  Free Report) are stocks worth considering in the broader technology sector. All the three stocks sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

634,CTXS,"Microsoft Corp ((MSFT  -  Free Report) put all speculations to rest by confirming the GitHub acquisition in after-hours trading, yesterday. The transaction, which involves Microsoft stock, is valued at approximately $7.5 billion.On Jun 3, Bloomberg had reported that Microsoft is in advanced talks to acquire the open-source software development platform giant, GitHub. Notably, the company was last valued at $2 billion in 2015.Shares of Microsoft have returned 40.2% in the past year, outperforming the industry’s rally of 30.1%. This outperformance can primarily be attributed to the company’s rapidly expanding efforts in AI and IoT based developments. Undisturbed focus on Azure remains a key catalyst.Why is Microsoft Interested?GitHub offers an open-source platform for coding enthusiasts and software developers. The platform brings developers together to work on projects without compromising on each other’s code. Founded in 2008, the “social coding” platform, which boasts of 28 million developers, has hosted around 80 million repositories, as of March 2018.The San Francisco-based GitHub has an impressive list of customer base which totalled more than 1.8 million organizations and businesses, as of March 2018. Companies like Airbnb, SAP, IBM, Google, PayPal, Walmart, Spotify, to mention a few, have leveraged GitHubs’s platform.The GitHub-Azure integration will further reinforce Microsoft’s commitment to its cloud-computing future as it aims to compete against the likes of Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) and fellow tech giants.The tech powerhouse also stated that it projects the acquisition to be accretive to non-GAAP operating income in fiscal 2020. Investors should note that Microsoft expects the buyout to dilute adjusted earnings by roughly 1% in fiscal years 2019 and 2020.Slowly but steadily, Microsoft is embracing the concept of open source (free software where code is written by software developers from all around the world) after being averse to it initially. The company has come a long way in its stance on the open-source database subject.Ever since Satya Nadella took over as the CEO of Microsoft in 2014, the company has been coming to terms with the concept in an impressive way. Around 2016, the company started to support the Linux operating system, an open source operating system on its cloud computing platform Azure.Microsoft is also committed to reorganize the company around its cloud-computing businesses and its Office business, instead of Windows. Last quarter, the company witnessed revenue figures of $26.82 billion, topping the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $25.71 billion. Furthermore, Microsoft’s Intelligent Cloud unit revenues, which comprise its rapidly growing Azure segment, climbed roughly 17% to reach $7.79 billion. Azure revenues alone soared 93%, after skyrocketing 98% last quarter.The acquisition is likely to boost collaborative coding and consequently, is expected to bode well for innovations in software development.Going forward, Microsoft anticipates GitHub acquisition to aid the company in becoming more future-oriented by encouraging more developers to create services and apps. This in turn will aid Azure compete better against other computing giants by being more appealing to customers.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderMicrosoft currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Aspen Technology, Inc. (AZPN  -  Free Report) and Citrix Systems, Inc. (CTXS  -  Free Report) are stocks worth considering in the same sector. Both the stocks sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

635,CTXS,"On Monday, the Nasdaq hit a fresh record high for the first time in almost three months. A rally in tech and consumer discretionary stocks ensued, indicating that investors are choosing to ignore trade tensions and geopolitical conflicts. Instead, markets are focusing on strong economic fundamentals following last Friday’s strong jobs report.The major catalyst to the day’s gains was a surge in shares of Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report), which hit an all-time high. Analysts believe that this is further evidence of upbeat sentiment about the economy. With investors choosing to show confidence in a sector which has had a turbulent ride this year, this seems to be the best time to invest in tech stocks that are part of the Nasdaq.   Apple, Amazon, Microsoft Power Broader GainsThe Nasdaq gained 0.7% on Monday, finishing at a record level for the first time since Mar 12. One of the major drivers of the day’s gains was a surge in shares of Apple. The iPhone maker’s stocks gained 0.8% to hit an all-time high. Gains were primarily attributable to the enthusiastic response to the company’s WWDC 2018 keynote. Shares of Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) also contributed to the day’s gains, increasing 1.5% to hit a record high. Microsoft Corporation’s (MSFT  -  Free Report) shares also gained 0.9% to hit a new record. These gains came after the software giant revealed that it was buying software developer GitHub for $7.5 billion. As a result, the Nasdaq failed to hit an intraday high by only around 0.5%.Investors Focusing on Economic FundamentalsStocks had surged last Friday following encouraging data from the Department of Labor. The economy added 223,000 jobs in May even as unemployment plummeted to an 18-year low. Additionally, wage gains remained limited, curbing fears about surging inflation which had caused losses in February.Investors continued to focus on the positive sentiment that this report spurred on Monday. Analysts are of the opinion that the surge in shares of Apple was an expression of confidence in the state of the U.S. economy.In choosing to focus on strong fundamentals, investors ignored a spate of headwinds that dampened sentiments recently. These include trade tensions with China and geopolitical concerns emanating from the discord with North Korea and the political situation in Italy.Our ChoicesFresh evidence of the United States’ robust economic health has pushed investors toward riskier assets over the last two trading days.

637,CTXS,"Investors may consider allocating their assets in stocks with a favorable liquidity position for big returns. Liquidity indicates a company’s capability of meeting debt obligations by converting assets into liquid cash and equivalents.Liquid stocks have always been in demand as these are believed to have the potential to boost portfolio returns. However, one should exercise caution before investing in such stocks. While a high liquidity level may imply that the company is meeting its obligations at a faster rate than its peers, it may also indicate that the company is failing to use its assets efficiently.Hence, one may consider the efficiency level of a company in addition to its liquidity to identify potential winners as this combination is indicative of underlying financial strength.Measures to Identify Liquid StocksCurrent Ratio: It measures current assets relative to current liabilities. This ratio is used for measuring a company’s potential to meet both short- and long-term debt obligations. Thus, a current ratio — also known as working capital ratio — below 1 indicates that the company has more liabilities than assets. However, a high current ratio does not always indicate that the company is in good financial shape. It may also mean that the company has failed to utilize its assets significantly. Hence, a range of 1 to 3 is considered ideal.Quick Ratio: Unlike current ratio, quick ratio – also called “acid-test ratio"" or ""quick assets ratio"" – indicates a company’s ability to pay short-term obligations. It considers inventory excluding current assets relative to current liabilities. Like the current ratio, a quick ratio of greater than 1 is desirable.Cash Ratio: This is the most conservative ratio among the three, as it takes into account only cash and cash equivalents, and invested funds relative to current liabilities. It measures a company’s ability to meet its current debt obligations using the most liquid of assets. Though a cash ratio higher than 1 may point to sound financials, a higher number may indicate inefficiency in cash utilization.So, a ratio greater than 1 is desirable at all times but may not always appropriately represent a company’s financial condition.Screening ParametersIn order to pick the best of the lot, we have added asset utilization, which is a widely used measure of a company’s efficiency, as one of the screening criteria. Asset utilization is the ratio of total sales over the past 12 months to the last four-quarter average of total assets. Though this ratio varies across industries, companies with a ratio higher than their respective industries can be considered efficient.In order to ensure that these liquid and efficient stocks have solid growth potential, we have added our proprietary Growth Style Score to the screen.Current Ratio, Quick Ratio and Cash Ratio between 1 and 3 (While liquidity ratios of greater than 1 are desirable, significantly high ratios may indicate inefficiency.)Asset utilization greater than industry average (Higher asset utilization than the industry average indicates a company’s efficiency.)Zacks Rank equal to #1 (Only Strong Buy-rated stocks can get through). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.  Growth Score less than or equal to B (Back-tested results show that stocks with a Growth Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 handily beat other stocks.)These criteria have narrowed down the universe of over 7,700 stocks to only 11.Here are five of the 11 stocks that qualified the screen:Sunnyvale, CA-based Mellanox Technologies Ltd. (MLNX  -  Free Report) is a leading supplier of semiconductor-based, interconnect products to world-class server, storage, and infrastructure OEMs servicing Fortune 500 data centers, the world's most powerful supercomputers, and mission critical embedded applications.

Further, the figure rose 10% from the year-ago quarter.Revenues increased 4.4% year over year to $12.463 billion and marginally surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $12.421 billion. Acquisitions contributed 120 basis points (bps) to revenue growth in the quarter.Strength witnessed in company’s Security and Applications segments drove year-over-year growth.

This was driven by growth in software and solutions services.Almost 32% of the revenues were recurring in nature gaining 2% from the year-ago quarter.Revenues from subscriptions represent 55% of the company’s software revenues.Recurring software and subscriptions generated $5.6 billion deferred product revenues, which surged 29% from the year-ago quarter.Geographically, Americas, EMEA and APJC reported revenue growth of 2%, 9% and 7% on a year-over-year basis, respectively. Total emerging markets grew 7% and the BRICs plus Mexico climbed 12%.In terms of customer segments, enterprise increased 11%, while service provider dropped 4%.

Cisco has realigned Product segments into four distinct categories — infrastructure platform, applications, security, and other.Cisco Systems, Inc. Revenue (TTM) Cisco Systems, Inc. Revenue (TTM) | Cisco Systems, Inc. QuoteWireless, Switching Witnessed GrowthInfrastructure Platforms (57.5% of third-quarter revenues) comprise Switching, NGN routing, Wireless and Data Center solutions. Revenues inched up 2% from the year-ago quarter to $7.16 billion.The year-over-year increase was primarily due to robust growth across switching, wireless and data center business. Switching revenues increased witnessed strong growth across campus and data center. Adoption of new campus switch, Cat9K was impressive.Further, wireless revenues grew on the back of company’s Wave 2 offerings and Meraki solution. Robust demand for the HyperFlex data-center solution drove data center’s double digit growth.However, continued weakness in service provider which led a slowdown in enterprise routing business remained a headwind during the quarter.Management stated that the subscription-based Catalyst 9000 switching platform has been adopted by more than 5,800 customers, up 2,700 sequentially. Moreover, results benefited from the continuing customer shift to 100 gig architectures. Additionally, rapid adoption of multi-cloud infrastructures was a key catalyst.Cisco’s ACI solution continues to witness traction. The company believes that ACI customers are gaining from increased business agility owing to network automation, simplified management and improved security features of the product. Management remains optimistic on the newly introduced ACI SDN offering.AppDynamics Drive GrowthApplications (10.5% of third-quarter revenues) consist of Collaboration portfolio of Unified Communications (“UC”), Conferencing and TelePresence, Internet of Things (“IoT”) and application software businesses such as AppDynamics and Jasper. Revenues increased 19% from the year-ago quarter to $1.31 billion.In the quarter, Cisco integrated its Cisco Spark with Webex Platform which enhanced Webex Meeting and enabled it to introduce Webex Teams, further strengthening the company’s collaboration portfolio.Collaboration revenues rose primarily driven by growth across AppDynamics, UC infrastructure and TelePresence endpoints.Security Remains StrongSecurity (4.7% of revenues) climbed 11% to $583 million. The results were noticeable as deferred revenues surged 38% from the year-ago quarter.Strong growth can be attributed to solid demand witnessed by web security, unified threat and advanced threat solutions.Cisco’s AI-driven Talos intelligence platform blocks 20 billion threats per day. The company is striving to leverage machine-learning to deploy security platforms to mitigate online risks on a real-time basis.Other ProductsOther Products segment (2% of revenues) contains service provider video, cloud and system management and various emerging technology offerings. Revenues fell 6% to $249 million.A positive development pertaining to the sector is the recent divestiture of a portion of company’s previously acquired NDS video assets. This move is likely to mitigate the sluggishness persistent in this segment.Operating DetailsNon-GAAP gross margin contracted 40 bps from the year-ago quarter to 63.9%. Management claims that the decrease can be attribute to higher memory pricing. This is anticipated to persist in the near term.Non-GAAP operating expenses during the quarter came in at $4.05 billion, up 5.7% year over year. Non-GAAP operating expenses, as percentage of revenues, expanded 40 bps to 32.5%.As a result, non-GAAP operating margin contracted 80 bps to 31.5%.Balance Sheet and Cash FlowCisco exited the third quarter with cash & cash equivalents and investments balance of almost $54.43 billion down from $67.97 billion in the prior-year quarter.

Furthermore, the company paid a cash dividend of 33 cents per share. Cisco Systems, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Cisco Systems, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Cisco Systems, Inc. QuoteGuidanceFor fourth-quarter fiscal 2018, revenues are expected to grow 4-6% on a year-over-year basis. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $12.71 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 4.8%.Non-GAAP earnings are anticipated between 68 cents and 70 cents per share.

The newly acquired company is set to join Collaboration Technology Group (“CTG”) of Cisco. Accompany’s robust enterprise AI capabilities will strengthen Cisco’s collaboration portfolio.We believe that company’s expanding footprint in the rapidly growing security market holds promise. Security solutions of Cisco are likely to witness traction, going forward. The company’s extended partnerships with the likes of Aon, Allianz and Rackspace are likely to boost security segment growth.However, weakness in the switching and routing is a headwind. Moreover, ongoing transition to subscription-based model will continue to hurt the top line. Arista’s (ANET  -  Free Report) recent intention of manufacturing switches that connect campus networks is likely to hurt Cisco as it holds a dominant position in that market.Zacks Rank and Other Stocks to ConsiderCisco currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Other top-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are Cadence Design Systems (CDNS  -  Free Report) and Citrix Systems (CTXS  -  Free Report), both sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

644,CTXS,"The liquidity of a company often indicates whether its business is going in a profitable direction. It primarily indicates a company’s capability to meet debt obligations by converting its assets into liquid cash and equivalents. These stocks have always been in demand due to their potential to provide maximum returns.However, one should exercise caution before investing in such stocks. While a high liquidity level may imply that the company is meeting its obligations at a faster rate than its peers, it may also indicate that the company is failing to use its assets efficiently.Hence, one may consider the efficiency level of a company in addition to its liquidity to identify potential winners.Measures to Identify Liquid StocksCurrent Ratio: It measures current assets relative to current liabilities. This ratio is used for measuring a company’s potential to meet both short- and long-term debt obligations. Thus, a current ratio — also known as working capital ratio — below 1 indicates that the company has more liabilities than assets. However, a high current ratio does not always indicate that the company is in good financial shape. It may also mean that the company has failed to utilize its assets significantly. Hence, a range of 1 to 3 is considered ideal.Quick Ratio: Unlike current ratio, quick ratio – also called “acid-test ratio"" or ""quick assets ratio"" – indicates a company’s ability to pay short-term obligations. It considers inventory excluding current assets relative to current liabilities. Like the current ratio, a quick ratio of greater than 1 is desirable.Cash Ratio: This is the most conservative ratio among the three, as it takes into account only cash and cash equivalents, and invested funds relative to current liabilities. It measures a company’s ability to meet its current debt obligations using the most liquid of assets. Though a cash ratio higher than 1 may point to sound financials, a higher number may indicate inefficiency in cash utilization.So, a ratio greater than 1 is desirable at all times but may not always appropriately represent a company’s financial condition.Screening ParametersIn order to pick the best of the lot, we have added asset utilization, which is a widely used measure of a company’s efficiency, as one of the screening criteria. Asset utilization is the ratio of total sales over the past 12 months to the last four-quarter average of total assets. Though this ratio varies across industries, companies with a ratio higher than their respective industries can be considered efficient.In order to ensure that these liquid and efficient stocks have solid growth potential, we have added our proprietary Growth Style Score to the screen.Current Ratio, Quick Ratio and Cash Ratio between 1 and 3 (While liquidity ratios of greater than 1 are desirable, significantly high ratios may indicate inefficiency.)Asset utilization greater than industry average (Higher asset utilization than the industry average indicates a company’s efficiency.)Zacks Rank equal to #1 (Only Strong Buy-rated stocks can get through). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Growth Style Score less than or equal to B (Back-tested results show that stocks with a Growth Style Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 handily beat other stocks.)These criteria have narrowed down the universe of over 7,700 stocks to only 13.Here are six of the 13 stocks that qualified the screen:Based in Fremont, CA, Lam Research Corporation (LRCX  -  Free Report) supplies wafer fabrication equipment and services to the semiconductor industry.

645,CTXS,"Shares of Symantec Corporation (SYMC  -  Free Report) recovered part of last Friday’s losses, yesterday, after the company announced a conference call to discuss the ongoing investigation, post market close, which investors believe, will throw light on its internal probe.It should be noted that the company, during the fourth-quarter 2018 earnings conference call, had announced that its board’s audit committee is making an internal investigation into concerns voiced by an ex-employee. The company did not divulge details on the nature of the investigation, however, it stated that it isn’t related to any security breach or concern regarding products and systems.Lack of clarity on the probe announced, along with executives’ refusal to take questions post the earnings conference call, resulted in a plunge of more than 33% in Symantec’s shares, last Friday, eroding almost $6 billion of the company’s market cap in a single day.However, the stock recovered 9.6% yesterday, following the company’s conference-call announcement. Though Symantec did not reveal much about the internal probe, its announcement reinstated investors’ confidence, reflected by the stock’s 2% improvement, at the after-hour trading.Notably, the stock has underperformed the industry in the year-to-date period. The industry, to which it belongs to, has gained 12.9%, while Symantec has lost 23.7%. The cyber-security provider noted that the probe relates to the reporting of certain non-GAAP accounting measures, which includes executive compensation too, public disclosures including commentary on the company’s historical financial results, certain forward-looking statements, stock trading plans and retaliation.Nevertheless, investors heaved a sigh of relief when Symantec mentioned that it “does not anticipate a material adverse impact on its historical financial statements” at this time.However, we believe its too early to predict what picture the investigation would paint, going forward. This is expected to throw light on serious issues which might severely cost the company in near future. Therefore, it is wise to wait and watch for some time for better visibility of the stock.Symantec currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the same space are PTC Inc.

The company has a long-term expected EPS growth rate of 15%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current quarter revenues is pegged at $251.52 million, representing a year-over-year growth of 37.72%.Robust AdoptionStrong product portfolio including the likes of FlashArray, FlashStack and FlashBlade business segments aid Pure Storage top-line. In the last reported quarter, the company added more than 500 new customers, bringing the total base to 4500 organizations and reflecting an increase of 50% from the year-ago quarter.Additionally, the company’s data platform for cloud is gaining traction. Per a ResearchandMarkets report, cloud storage market is anticipated to grow at a CAGR of 29.73% from $25.17 billion in 2017 to reach $92.49 billion in 2022. The company is well poised to capitalize on the opportunity.Pure Storage continues to focus on three major aspects, namely increasing cloud customer base, solidifying the position of its next generation workload related core data infrastructure and tapping large enterprises as they “cloudify” their on-premise IT infrastructure.Partnerships and Collaborations: Key CatalystCisco’s tie-up with the company’s FlashStack has significantly accelerated overall converged infrastructure and integrated systems markets. FlashStack is well-positioned for the future as the company continues to invest with its partners in full stack automation and simplicity.Management is optimistic about scalable storage solutions in an era when the world is typically being driven by big-data, artificial intelligence (“AI”) and data analytics-based information.Pure Storage strengthened its partnership with NVIDIA, a dominant player in AI related computation, to expand product offerings. The company recently released AIRI in collaboration with NVIDIA.The company claims AIRI to be a first-of-a-kind AI ready infrastructure. AIRI will cut short the time required for data to generate valuable insights significantly, consequently accelerating innovation.Per Gartner, 80% of enterprises are anticipated to deploy AI within 2020, which enhances the prospects of AIRI.Improving Cash PositionPure Storage recently announced plans of offering $450 million of convertible senior notes in a private placement. The interest rate, conversion rate and certain other terms of the notes are yet to be determined. Interest on the notes will be paid semi-annually and mature in 2023, subject to customary closing conditions.The enhanced capital deployment reflects Pure Storage’s strong balance sheet and confidence in long-term business prospects. The company exited the year ended Jan 31, 2018 with cash and cash equivalents of $183.7 million.The company has a strong balance sheet, which will help it in capitalizing on investment opportunities and pursuing strategic acquisitions, further improving growth prospects. Moreover, the senior notes offering will lower its cost of capital, consequently strengthening balance sheet and supporting growth.Positive free cash flow for the full-year ended Jan 31, 2018 was reported for the first time in the company’s history at $7.7 million, compared with ($61.2 million) fiscal 2017. This can be attributed to strong performance in the quarter and employee stock purchase worth $11.5 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018.Underlying RisksThe aforementioned points will enable Pure Storage to remain afloat in difficult times. However, the company continues to face intense competition due to the presence of major players such as Amazon Web Services (“AWS”) and Microsoft Azure in cloud storage.Zacks Rank and Key PicksPure Storage carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks trading at 52-week high include Citrix Systems, Inc (CTXS  -  Free Report), NetApp, Inc.

With the acquisition, OPTIS’ feature-rich virtual reality (VR) platform will complement ANSYS offerings to help automotive manufacturers supply safer driverless vehicles. Safer navigation will be ensured by development of futuristic camera, lidar and radar.The buyout of 3DSIM, a leading additive manufacturing simulation technology provider, will help ANSYS to foray into 3D metal printing and access the industry's only complete additive manufacturing simulation workflow.Acquisitions like 3DSIM and OPTIS are not only enabling ANSYS to bring innovative solutions to the market but are also aiding it to enhance foothold in the competitive simulations market. However, its margin is expected to remain under pressure as ANSYS continues to invest on product development.Zacks Rank & Key PicksANSYS carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks worth considering in the computer-software industry are PTC Inc.

649,CTXS,"Have you been paying attention to shares of Citrix Systems (CTXS  -  Free Report)? Shares have been on the move with the stock up 14% over the past month. CTXS hit a new 52-week high of $104.88 in the previous session. Citrix Systems has gained 19% since the start of the year compared to the 2.9% move for the Computer and Technology sector and the 10% year-to-date return for its peer group.What's Driving the Outperformance?The stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises, having beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on April 25, 2018, Citrix Systems reported EPS of $1.29 versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.05 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 3.17%.For the current fiscal year, Citrix Systems is expected to post earnings of $5.3 per share on $2.9 billion in revenues. This represents a 9.28% change in EPS on a 2.82% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $5.84 per share on $3.01 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 10.27% and 3.67%, respectively.Valuation MetricsCitrix Systems may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for CTXS? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.Citrix Systems has a Value Score of D. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are B and A, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of B.In terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 19.8X current fiscal year EPS estimates. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 18.8X versus its peer group's average of 23X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 2.18. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.Citrix Systems, Inc. Price and Consensus  Citrix Systems, Inc. Price and Consensus | Citrix Systems, Inc. QuoteZacks RankWe also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Citrix Systems currently has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Citrix Systems passes the test. Thus, it seems as though CTXS shares could still be poised for more gains ahead.How Does Citrix Systems Stack Up to the Competition?Shares of Citrix Systems have been soaring, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? Some of its industry peers are also solid potential picks, including EPAM Systems (EPAM  -  Free Report), CACI International (CACI  -  Free Report), and Baidu (BIDU  -  Free Report), all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least #2 and a VGM Score of at least B, making them well-rounded choices.The Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 23% of all the industries we have in our universe, so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for CTXS, even beyond its own solid fundamental situation.

650,CTXS,"Liquidity indicates a company’s capability of meeting its debt obligations by converting its assets into liquid cash and equivalents. Companies with a favorable liquidity position have always been in demand as they are believed to have the potential to boost portfolio returns.However, one should exercise caution before investing in such stocks. While a high liquidity level may imply that the company is meeting its obligations at a faster rate than its peers, it may also indicate that the company is failing to use its assets efficiently.Hence, one may consider the efficiency level of a company in addition to its liquidity to identify potential winners.Measures to Identify Liquid StocksCurrent Ratio: It measures current assets relative to current liabilities. This ratio is used for measuring a company’s potential to meet both short- and long-term debt obligations. Thus, a current ratio — also known as working capital ratio — below 1 indicates that the company has more liabilities than assets. However, a high current ratio does not always indicate that the company is in good financial shape. It may also mean that the company has failed to utilize its assets significantly. Hence, a range of 1 to 3 is considered ideal.Quick Ratio: Unlike current ratio, quick ratio – also called “acid-test ratio"" or ""quick assets ratio"" – indicates a company’s ability to pay short-term obligations. It considers inventory excluding current assets relative to current liabilities. Like the current ratio, a quick ratio of greater than 1 is desirable.Cash Ratio: This is the most conservative ratio among the three, as it takes into account only cash and cash equivalents, and invested funds relative to current liabilities. It measures a company’s ability to meet its current debt obligations using the most liquid of assets. Though a cash ratio higher than 1 may point to sound financials, a high number may indicate inefficiency in cash utilization.So, a ratio greater than 1 is desirable at all times but may not always appropriately represent a company’s financial condition.Screening ParametersIn order to pick the best of the lot, we have added asset utilization, which is a widely used measure of a company’s efficiency, as one of the screening criteria. Asset utilization is the ratio of total sales over the past 12 months to the last four-quarter average of total assets. Though this ratio varies across industries, companies with a ratio higher than their respective industries can be considered efficient.In order to ensure that these liquid and efficient stocks have solid growth potential, we have added our proprietary  Growth Style Score to the screen.Current Ratio, Quick Ratio and Cash Ratio between 1 and 3 (While liquidity ratios of greater than 1 are desirable, significantly high ratios may indicate inefficiency.)Asset utilization greater than industry average (Higher asset utilization than the industry average indicates a company’s efficiency.)Zacks Rank equal to #1 (Only Strong Buy-rated stocks can get through).  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Growth Style Score less than or equal to B (Back-tested results show that stocks with a Growth Style Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 handily beat other stocks.)These criteria have narrowed down the universe of over 7,700 stocks to only nine.Here are five of the nine stocks that qualified the screen:Based in Fremont, CA, Lam Research Corporation (LRCX  -  Free Report) supplies wafer fabrication equipment and services to the semiconductor industry.

The strong portfolio is helping MobileIron to rapidly penetrate into the Enterprise Mobile Management (“EMM”), Cloud Security, Desktop Security and the Internet of Things (“IoT”) market. In the quarter under review, the company’s EMM services were selected by Cordaan, an Amsterdam healthcare provider.The company’s products particularly, MobileIron Cloud and MobileIron Access enjoy steady demand from federal governments worldwide. Previous contract wins from the Slovenian railways and the Public Health Agency of Sweden is likely to bode well for the company.Furthermore, in its latest report ""Crisp Vendor Universe 2018 for Workplace & Mobility"", German research firm Crisp Research AG named MobileIron as the “Leader in the Unified Endpoint Management (UEM) segment.”During the quarter, the company’s MobileIron Bridge platform was selected by German Red Cross of Rhineland-Palatinate to manage laptops and smartphones running Windows 10 centrally. Additionally, MobileIron Core, will enable Rhineland-Palatinate to delete corporate data from employee devices after they discontinue their services, or block access.MobileIron continues to gain from its product selections by wireless carriers like Verizon Communications and T-Mobile.The company’s app distribution, analytics, and security offerings along with Google Cloud's Orbitera commerce platform furnished an integrated software solution which ensures an end-to-end solution beginning from purchase to deployment. Customized solutions will empower both the customers and suppliers with a seamless and secured cloud experience.Notably, company’s MobileAccess platform has been integrated into Concur, Tableau, Workday, Facebook, Microsoft’s Office 365, Octa, One Login, Paint and DropBox. Further, the integration with Google Cloud will aid customer wins, which remains a key top-line growth driver.What Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Our proven model shows that MobileIron is unlikely to beat earnings this quarter.

(CTXS  -  Free Report) has announced a restructuring program in a bid to expedite the transformation to a cloud-based subscription business, increase strategic focus as well as improve operational efficiency.The program will witness removal of some full-time positions and consolidation of facilities.. However, layoffs outside the United States will be subject to local law and consultation requirements.The company expects to incur around $60-$100 million pre-tax restructuring charges from the program. The same is inclusive of roughly $55-$70 million related to employee severance costs and around $5-$30 million, associated with consolidation of leased facilities and other expenses pertaining to the plan. The company hopes to complete most the restructuring activities during fourth-quarter 2017 and fiscal 2018.Notably, Citrix has been struggling on the bottom-line front for quite some time now. Apart from other headwinds limiting the bottom-line growth, frequent management changes at the company do not seem to bode well as far as investors’ confidence in the stock is concerned.Very recently, Citrix  announced appointment of Mark J. Ferrer as Executive Vice President and Chief Revenue Officer. In addition, the company reported a change in board composition by roping in Dr. Ajei S. Gopal. Gopal is the President and CEO of ANSYS Inc. (ANSS  -  Free Report).Additionally, Citrix has been making frequent changes to the designation of CEO. Earlier in July, the company had appointed David J. Henshall as new President and CEO, thus recruiting four CEOs in a row in less than two years.Such recurrent management changes apart, Citrix’s bottom line has been hurt by considerable steep costs. Declining revenues from products and licenses also throw a severe challenge to the company.  In light of Citrix’s cost-cutting and restructuring efforts, it remains to be seen whether its actions increase profitability and find favor with shareholders.Citrix Systems, Inc.

663,CTXS,"Citrix Systems Inc. (CTXS  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Jan 31 after the market closes.Last quarter, the company recorded a positive earnings surprise of 17.3%. Moreover, it has surpassed estimates in each of the preceding four quarters with an average beat of 8%.Let’s see, how things are shaping up for this announcement.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Citrix is likely to beat estimates this quarter on the back of its perfect combination of the two key ingredients:Zacks ESP: Citrix has an Earnings ESP of +0.52%, representing the difference between the Most Accurate estimate — pegged higher at $1.61 per share — and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.60. A positive Zacks ESP indicates a likely earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Citrix has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which incresaes the predictive power of ESP as stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 have significantly higher chances of an earnings beat.Conversely, the Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.Citrix Systems, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Citrix Systems, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Citrix Systems, Inc. QuoteWhat is Driving This Better-than-Expected Earnings?Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) revenues are again expected to grow strong in the fourth quarter like the last three quarters. This in turn will boost the company’s top line in the period as well. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter SaaS revenues stands at $48.42 million, higher than $45.81 million reported in the previous quarter.Moreover, a centralized management of employee desktops will provide greater security, control and cost savings, which might further aid results in the quarter.The company’s efforts to expand product portfolio are also impressive.Its strong customer base is another positive. Also, the merger between LogMeIn (LOGM  -  Free Report) and Citrix's GoTo business, completed last February, is likely to be value accretive in the quarter to be reported.Additionally, the company’s endeavors to reward shareholders through dividends and share buybacks are encouraging. In November 2017, the company’s board of directors cleared a share buyback program worth more than $2 billion. It can buyback up to an additional $1.7 billion of the company's common stock under the new authorization.The company’s attempts to reduce its debt levels are also impressive. This is evident from the fact that the ratio of its long-term debt-to-equity (expressed as a percentage) stands at 69. This compares favorably to the figure of 82.9% for the S&P 500 Index.However, high costs may hurt the bottom line in the fourth quarter as in the previous one. Additionally, foreign exchange movements are quite a drag on the company’s results in the soon-to-be-reported period.Other Stocks to ConsiderInvestors also interested in other stocks worth considering from the broader Computer and Technology sector may check out the following companies with the right combination of elements to beat on earnings in their respective quarters:Apple Inc.

664,CTXS,"Nokia Corporation (NOK  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 financial numbers on Feb 1.Last quarter, the company reported earnings (non-IFRS) per share of €0.09 (approximately 11 cents) that surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 6 cents. In the year-ago period, the company had reported earnings of €0.04 (5 cents) per share.Net sales declined year over year to €5.5 billion (approximately $6.5 billion). However, the top line outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.41 billion but fell short of the year-ago figure of approximately $6.57 billion. This was because revenues were hurt by the Nokia Networks’ disappointing performance.Let’s see how things shape up for this announcement.Factors Likely at PlayThe disappointing performance of Nokia’s primary division, the Networks unit, is likely to hurt results in the fourth quarter. Weakness in the Ultra Broadband Networks’ subgroup is likely to result in Nokia’s flagship division’s poor performance in the soon-to-be-reported quarter. The company also expects segmental results in the final quarter of 2017 to be hurt primarily due to competition in the Chinese market.Furthermore, the top line in the fourth quarter might be hampered by adverse foreign currency movements since the company operates globally. However, Nokia’s revenues are likely to benefit from payments in the quarter, following a favorable verdict in a payment-related dispute with BlackBerry (BB  -  Free Report).Additionally, Nokia’s technology segment is likely to perform well in the soon-to-be reported quarter, thereby aiding results.Nokia Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Nokia Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Nokia Corporation QuoteEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Nokia is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here as elaborated below.Zacks ESP: Nokia has an Earnings ESP of -14.29%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at 9 cents, 2 cents below the Zacks Consensus Estimate. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. Zacks Rank: Nokia has a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company’s negative ESP acts as a spoiler.We caution against all Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderInvestors interested in the broader Computer and Technology sector may consider the following companies as they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Harris Corporation (HRS  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.11% and a Zacks Rank of 2.

We expect an update on the issue on the fiscal second-quarter conference call. Reduction in engineering, selling & administrative expenses are also expected to boost the bottom line.However, the company’s Communication Systems segment might struggle in the quarter, due to reduced sales of legacy international tactical radios.Harris Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Harris Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Harris Corporation QuoteWhat Does Our Model Indicate?Our proven model too shows that Harris Corp. is likely to beat on earnings in the to-be-reported quarter because it has the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase its odds of an earnings surprise.Zacks ESP: Harris Corporation has an Earnings ESP of +0.11%.

666,CTXS,"The U.S. telecommunications industry had a disappointing 2017. Cut-throat pricing competition resulting in lower ARPU (average revenue per user) and margins, massive investment for upcoming 5G wireless network and fiber optic buildout resulting in low free cash flow and intense competitive pressure shifted investor’s focus toward other growth-oriented industries in an overall bull market in 2017.However, the situation has been showing signs of easing from fourth-quarter 2017 as most of the major telecommunications stocks have done well since then. The momentum is likely to continue in 2018 albeit at a slow pace. Several positives have appeared for this industry in the last quarter of 2017.Major PositivesPresident Donald Trump’s proposed policy changes have made the overall economic outlook fairly bullish. The two pro-growth agendas of Trump, namely, significant cut in corporate tax and deregulation are major catalysts to the U.S. economy.  Trump has stated that he wants to do away with nearly 75% of all governmental regulations during his term as the President. We believe that the telecom industry will be one of the major beneficiaries of this policy change.On Dec 14, 2017, in a landmark decision, the U.S. telecom regulator Federal Communications Commission (FCC) repealed the Net Neutrality laws that it had imposed under the Obama regime. There is little doubt that the ISP industry will be the major beneficiary after FCC dismantling Net Neutrality. The current FCC's less-restrictive regulatory attitude may also pave the way for new merger and acquisition deals between ISPs and online digital media companies.The proposal to reduce corporate tax rate from 35% to 20% faced by telecom carriers would be immediately accretive to cash flow. Trump’s tax proposal will result in a huge windfall for telecom operators. The carriers can utilize this money for 5G network R&D and its deployment.  The telecom industry is highly capital-intensive in nature. Therefore, the immediate expensing of investment in all tangible, intangible and real property (other than land) would significantly benefit telecom carriers. This would encourage telecom operators to increase investment for capital expenditure. Major proposals such as a pledge to spend $1 trillion in infrastructure projects over a period of 10 years coupled with the above-mentioned policy changes are likely to spur higher consumer spending.Performance So FarPer the latest Zacks Earnings Trend report, only 53 S&P 500 members have reported fourth-quarter earnings results as of Jan 19. Total earnings for these companies are up 11.7% from the same period last year on 7.5% higher revenues, with 81.1% beating EPS estimates and 75.5% beating revenue estimates. The proportion of companies beating both EPS and revenue estimates is 62.3%.The Q4 earnings season is on track and is expected to be very good. Four important points can be inferred from the results thus far. First, the +11.7% earnings growth for the 53 index members compares is about the same as the +11.9% growth in Q3 and modestly below the 4-quarter average of +12.8%. Second, the +7.5% revenue growth for these 53 index members represents a notable acceleration in growth momentum. Third, the 81.1% proportion of the companies beating EPS estimates in Q4 is the highest we have seen from these 53 index members in other recent periods. Fourth, the 75.5% of the companies beating revenues is similarly the highest we have seen from this group of companies in recent periods. (Read More: Q4 Earnings Season: Strong Growth, But Weak Quality)In the telecom space, so far, national wireless behemoth Verizon Communications has reported Q4 results. The result was a mixed bag. While the top line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate, the bottom line lagged the same. Nevertheless, the carrier has witnessed significant net addition of postpaid wireless subscribers with reduced churn rate.How to Make a Selection?With the existence of a number of industry players, finding the right stocks that have the potential to beat earnings estimates could appear a difficult task, however, our proprietary methodology makes it fairly simple for you. One way to narrow down the list of choices during the earnings season is to look at stocks that have the combination of a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP.Earnings ESP is our proprietary methodology for identifying stocks that have high chances of surprising with their next earnings announcement. It shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Our research shows that for stocks with this combination, the chances of a positive earnings surprise are as high as 70%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Our ChoicesRelying on the above methodology, we have zeroed in on five telecom stocks that are likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this earnings season.Harris Corp. (HRS  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.11% and a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank  stocks here. The company is scheduled to report results on Jan 30. It has an average positive earnings surprise of 2.80% in the last four quarters and a long-term (three-five years) earnings growth rate of 6.00%.Vocera Communications Inc. (VCRA  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +15.32% and a Zacks Rank #3. The company is scheduled to report results on Feb 8. It has an average positive earnings surprise of a whopping 44.86% in the last four quarters and a substantial long-term (three-five years) earnings growth rate of 17.75%.Extreme Networks Inc. (EXTR  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +7.69% and a Zacks Rank #3. The company is scheduled to report results on Feb 7. It has an average positive earnings surprise of a whopping 27.54% in the last four quarters and a substantial long-term (three-five years) earnings growth rate of 17.00%.Plantronics Inc. (PLT  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.69% and a Zacks Rank #3. The company is scheduled to report results on Jan 30. It has an average positive earnings surprise of 5.85% in the last four quarters and a substantial long-term (three-five years) earnings growth rate of 15.00%.Citrix Systems Inc. (CTXS  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.52% and a Zacks Rank #3. The company is scheduled to report results on Jan 31. It has an average positive earnings surprise of 7.97% in the last four quarters and a long-term (three-five years) earnings growth rate of 5.33%.Bottom LineWhile the U.S. telecom industry offers several growth catalysts in the long term, buoyed by favourable economic and industry-related factors, we believe investor’s should also take care of any near-term fluctuations due to growing competition and increasing saturation of the U.S. wireless market. However, a number of companies in the space have fared well. Picking some outperformers from the space, backed by a solid Zacks Rank and a positive Earnings ESP, could lead investors to gain this earnings season.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

667,CTXS,"On Dec 26, we issued an updated research report on Citrix Systems, Inc. (CTXS  -  Free Report). The stock has been downgraded to a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) from a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Going by the Zacks proven model, the Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) are likely to underperform the broader market over the next one-three months.Reasons Behind the DowngradeHigh costs are limiting the company’s bottom-line growth and the fourth quarter is likely to be no different in this regard. Additionally, declining revenues from products also pose a severe challenge to the company. Moreover, frequent management changes do not bode well for the company and have potential to shake investors’ confidence in the stock. Notably, in July, the company made a change at its helm, replacing Kirill Tatarinov with David J. Henshall as its chief executive officer (CEO). Henshall’s appointment implies that Citrix has had four CEOs in less than two years.The company’s results are also liable to be affected by foreign exchange movements as it continues to foray into non-U.S. markets.Shares of Citrix Systems have underperformed the industry it belongs to in a year. The stock has declined 3.3% against the industry’s gain of 33.9% over the same period. The company’s VGM Score of C also raises concerns. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of all these three scores.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the same space are Nuance Communications, Inc.

669,CTXS,"The technology sector is poised to hog the spotlight as we head into the busiest week of the Q3 earnings cycle.According to the latest Zacks Earnings Preview, 87 S&P 500 members or 24.7% of the index’s total membership have reported quarterly results as of Oct 20. Of these, approximately 71.3% of the companies posted positive earnings surprises, while 70.1% beat top-line expectations. Earnings of these companies grew 9.4% from the comparable period last year, while revenues were up 7.3%.The trend this earnings season indicates that we will finally see back-to-back five quarters of earnings growth after five straight quarters of decline. The report projects that earnings for the S&P 500 index will improve 2.6% from the year-ago period, while total revenues will be up 5%.Tech Stocks Continue to OutperformTechnology is one of the four sectors which are expected to report strong earnings growth in the third quarter. The other three are Oil/Energy, Industrial Products and Construction.Various technology giants, including Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report), Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) and Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), are scheduled to report quarterly numbers this week. Per the report, total earnings for the tech sector are projected to be up 9.9% on 7.1% higher revenues for the third quarter.We note that the technology sector has been a strong performer on a year-to-date basis. The sector is benefiting from increasing demand for cloud-based platforms, growing adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions, Augmented/Virtual reality devices, autonomous cars, advanced driver assisted systems (ADAS) and Internet of Things (IoT) related software.Not All Companies Poised to ShineThough the overall tech sector is poised to shine in the quarter to be reported, this does not ensure earnings beat for all companies in the space. It should be noted that a company’s earnings outperformance is dependent on the overall business environment as well as management’s ability to implement operating and strategic plans.In other words, a company may perform dismally despite a favorable business environment if it fails to capitalize on the opportunities due to lack of execution.Notably, our research shows that when a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) stock is combined with a positive Earnings ESP, the chance of beating earnings estimates is high.

Acquisitions have been one of the key strategies of CA to enhance its IT management, software and services portfolio.  Acquisitions have fortified its position in virtualization, automation, assurance in the cloud computing environment. We believe the diversity of the company’s products and increased efficiency offered by such buyouts will entice customers across sectors, lending stability to its business model. Furthermore, CA’s “go to market” sales strategy helps generate sales while simultaneously slashing costs. However, heightening competition from Oracle, International Business Machines and HP Inc., as well as adverse currency translations continue to be hurdles, and are expected to dent margins and sales in fiscal 2018.

With the company making significant investments to expand its product portfolio, costs are likely to flare up. Personnel expenses are expected to shoot up as well, hurting the bottom line. In addition to this, Citrix System’s results in the to-be-reported quarter are liable to be affected by foreign exchange movements as it continues to foray into non-U.S. markets.

670,CTXS,"Citrix Systems Inc. (CTXS  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 25, after the market closes.In the second quarter of 2017, the company had delivered a positive earnings surprise to the tune of 4%. It also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in terms of revenues.However, things do not look bright for the company in the quarter under review. In fact, the negative sentiment surrounding the stock can be gauged from the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter, which moved down 12.6% over the last 90 days.Moreover, shares of Citrix Systems have struggled lately, underperforming the Zacks Software industry on a year-to-date basis. The stock has been down 7.3%, as against the industry’s rally of 29%.Lets delve deep to find out the factors likely to impact Citrix Systems’ third-quarter results.We expect high costs to hurt the company’s bottom line in the third quarter of 2017. With the company making significant investments to expand its product portfolio, costs are likely to shoot up. Personnel expenses are expected to be high as well, hurting the bottom line. Moreover, Citrix System’s results in the to-be-reported quarter are liable to be affected by foreign exchange movements as it continues to foray into non-U.S. markets.Markedly, the company expects net revenues in the band of $685-$695 million. Earnings per share (on an adjusted basis) are projected in the range of $1.02-$1.05. Both figures compare unfavorably to those reported a year-ago.Revenues from products and licenses are expected to be soft in the quarter under review, thus hurting the top line. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter’s revenues from products and licenses is pegged at $203 million, 3.8% lower than the reported figure in the second quarter of 2017.Amid the gloomy scenario, revenues from Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) are expected to be strong in the quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter SaaS revenues is pegged at $43.6 million, 5.1% higher than reported figure in the second quarter.Given this backdrop, investors would keenly await Citrix Systems’ third-quarter results under its new chief executive officer (CEO) — David J. Henshall – appointed in July 2017. Notably, Henshall has succeeded Kirill Tatarinov, who had joined Citrix from Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report). The appointment of Henshall implies that Citrix has had four CEOs in less than two years. In fact, these frequent changes at its helm have contributed to the stock’s underperformance.We believe that the company’s third-quarter results would be an indicator to whether the appointment of Henshall yields the desired results as Citrix expects to increase its profitability and find favor with shareholders.What Does Our Model Say?Our proven model too does not show that Citrix Systems is likely to beat earnings in this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

Comparatively, the number of job additions in August was 237,000, revised later to 228,000.Economists attributed lower number of job additions in September to small-business sector losing jobs in the wake of hurricanes Harvey and Irma.

The stock has depreciated 12.4%, as against the industry’s rally of 25.1% in the same period.  Apart from other headwinds that is limiting bottom-line growth, the frequent management changes at Citrix also do not seem to bode well as far as investors’ confidence in the stock is concerned.

675,CTXS,"Per the latest Earnings Outlook, the Q2 earnings season has crossed the half-way mark already, with 286 of the S&P 500 members or 68.8% of total market capitalization having reported quarterly results till Jul 28.Out of the companies that have reported their quarterly numbers, approximately 74.5% posted positive earnings surprises, while 69.2% beat top-line expectations. According to the report, earnings of these companies are up 11.3% from the same period last year, while revenues have increased 6.1%.The trend this earnings season indicates that we will finally see back-to-back four quarters of earnings growth after five straight quarters of decline. The report projects that earnings for the S&P 500 index will improve 9.2% from the year-ago period, while total revenue will be up 5%.The earnings reporting cycle for the second quarter is in full swing, with results of over 1000 companies, including 130 S&P 500 members scheduled to be out this week. Out of these, a number of tech companies are slated to report quarterly figures over the next few days. So far, the earnings scenario for the overall sector has been pretty impressive.Technology Stocks Continue to OutperformAlthough the Q2 earnings growth is broad based, majority of the contribution is coming from three sectors, Technology being one among them. The other two solid performing sectors are Finance and Energy.Per the latest Earnings Outlook, 66.1% of the sector’s market cap in the S&P 500 index has already reported, as of Jul 28.

Earnings of these companies are up 18.8% from the same period last year, while revenues increased 8.4%.We note that the technology sector has been a strong performer on a year-to-date basis. The sector is benefiting from increasing demand for cloud-based platforms, growing adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions, Augmented/Virtual reality devices, autonomous cars, advanced driver assisted systems (ADAS) and Internet of Things (IoT) related software.However, this does not ensure earnings beat for all companies in the space. It should be noted that a company’s earnings outperformance is dependent on the overall business environment, as well as management’s ability to implement operating and strategic plans.In other words, a company may perform dismally despite a favorable business environment if it fails to capitalize on the opportunities due to lack of execution.Let’s see what’s in store for these software stocks, all of which are scheduled to release quarterly numbers on Aug 2.CA Inc.

676,CTXS,"Motorola Solutions, Inc.(MSI  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results on Aug 3, after the market closes.In fact, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 28% in the previous quarter. It has also outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the last four quarters with an average beat of 16.62%.Notably, Motorola Solutions has an impressive track record with respect to earnings that is reflected in its price performance for the last one year. While the stock has surged 33.7%, its industry gained only 1% in the same period.However, our quantitative model does not conclusively show earnings beat for Motorola Solutions this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen, which is not the case here, as you will see below:Zacks ESP: Motorola Solutions has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 99 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Motorola Solutions has a Zacks Rank #2, which increases the predictive power of ESP.

Price and EPS Surprise  Motorola Solutions, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Motorola Solutions, Inc. QuoteFactors Likely at PlayThe company’s efforts to expand its product portfolio are encouraging. In fact, its performance has been boosted by the acquisition of Airwave Solutions, which was completed last year. Moreover, the Airwave Solutions buyout is anticipated to drive second-quarter revenues. Also, the acquisitions of Spillman Technologies and Interexport are expected to augment the top line.Motorola Solutions projects revenues in the to-be-reported quarter to improve in the band of 2% to 3% on a year-over-year basis. Adjusted earnings per share are expected to be in 98 cents to $1.03 range.We are also impressed by the company’s efforts to reward investors through dividend payments and buybacks. Nevertheless, we believe that costs related to the abovementioned acquisitions will hurt the bottom line.Moreover, adverse foreign currency movements might hamper results in the quarter. The company’s high debt levels also remain a concern.Stocks to ConsiderInvestors interested in the broader Computer and Technology sector may consider the following stocks, since our model shows that these companies also possess the right combination of elements to come up with an earnings beat this time.Citrix Systems (CTXS  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.18% and a Zacks Rank #3.

677,CTXS,"Equinix Inc. (EQIX  -  Free Report) is set to report second-quarter 2017 results on Aug 2. Last quarter, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 16.95%. Notably, the stock outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate over the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 20.96%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayEquinix is a global provider of network-neutral data centers and internet exchange services for enterprises, content companies, systems integrators, and network service providers. The company operates across various geographical regions and its increasing popularity among major tech industry players looking for data management will likely drive revenues in the second quarter.Acquisitions have been a major growth driver for Equinix and helped it expand data center capacity in many of its key markets since 2003. We anticipate the company’s buyouts of Telecity Group, Bit-isle and Nimbo, to boost the top line in the quarter.Expansion in important markets and consolidation of facilities in existing ones have been important parts of Equinix's core strategy. We believe that the company’s focus on offering upgraded technology to attract clients will bolster its revenues and profitability in the to-be-reported quarter.However, we remain slightly cautious about the huge capital outlays, which may dent Equinix’s second-quarter profitability. It should be noted that Equinix had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $4.938 billion, while the total debt principal outstanding was $9.27 billion as on Mar 31, 2017. Growing debt burden will affect the company’s profitability in the quarter as interest expense would go up.Moreover, increasing competition from established internet data center operators, such as AT&T (T  -  Free Report), Level 3 Communications, COLT and Verizon, will affect product pricing, thereby thwarting margins.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Equinix is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in its upcoming release. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Unfortunately, this is not the case here as elaborated below.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Equinix is 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at $3.41. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Equinix carries a Zacks Rank #3. Though a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 increases the predictive power of ESP, the company’s ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Equinix, Inc.

678,CTXS,"Cirrus Logic Inc. (CRUS  -  Free Report) is set to report first-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Aug 2. Last quarter, the company recorded a positive earnings surprise of 23.73%. Notably, the stock outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 40.85%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this quarter.Factors to ConsiderCirrus Logic is a premier supplier of high-performance analog circuits and advanced mixed-signal chip solutions. The company delivered better-than-expected fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results.  The year-over-year comparisons on both earnings and revenue front were also favorable.Continued investments in the audio segment have helped Cirrus Logic to come with innovative products time to time. This helps the company in attracting new customers and brings in additional revenues. We expect this factor to positively impact the company’s to-be-reported quarter results as it did in the earlier quarters too. Additionally, synergies from acquisitions and expansion in the LED market are anticipated to drive the fiscal first-quarter results.Nonetheless, sluggish economic growth, as well as IT spending may affect its fiscal first-quarter performance. Moreover, the company faces competition from the likes of Texas Instruments Inc. (TXN  -  Free Report) and STMicroelectronics, which also remain a concern for the to-be-reported quarter results.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Cirrus Logic will likely beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for Cirrus Logic is 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 54 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Cirrus Logic carries a Zacks Rank #3. Though this increases the predictive power of ESP, the company’s ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.Conversely, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Cirrus Logic, Inc.

679,CTXS,"We expect cybersecurity company, Symantec Corporation (SYMC  -  Free Report), to beat expectations when it reports first-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Aug 2.Last quarter, the company posted a negative earnings surprise of 75%. Notably, Symantec has a mixed record of earnings surprises in recent quarters. The stock has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate twice, missed the same in one occasion and came in line with the other, over the trailing four quarters. It has an average negative earnings surprise of 13.8%. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Symantec is likely to beat on earnings because it has the right combination of the two key components.Zacks ESP: Symantec currently has an Earnings ESP of +16.67%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at 14 cents, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate comes in lower at 12 cents. A favorable Earnings ESP serves as a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Symantec currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). It should be noted that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings. Conversely, stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.The combination of Symantec’s Zacks Rank #2 and a positive ESP make us reasonably confident of a positive earnings beat.Symantec Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Symantec Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Symantec Corporation QuoteWhat's Driving the Better-than-Expected Earnings?Symantec has been clocking solid returns, and in the year-to-date period it has gained approximately 29.9%, outperforming 22.3% growth recorded by the industry, which it belongs to.We believe that the company will continue to benefit from strong demand for cybersecurity solutions. It should be noted that the financial well-being, brand image, and reputation of enterprises and governments are always exposed to the risk of cyber threats. Consequently, cybersecurity has become a mission-critical, high-profile requirement.With rapid technological advancement, organizations are increasingly adopting the “bring your own device” (BYOD) policy to enhance employee productivity, with anytime/anywhere access. This trend, in turn, calls for stricter data security measures.Moreover, various independent research firms had forecast strong demand in 2017. Gartner had predicted that the worldwide Information Security spending would reach $90 billion in 2017, marking 7.6% growth from the 2016 level of approximately $83.6 billion.We believe that Symantec must have capitalized on this opportunity. We anticipate that this might be well reflected in the company’s results in the quarter to be reported.Furthermore, the company’s mobile and cloud security products are gradually gaining market acceptance. The storage and server management business provides recovery solutions and heterogeneous storage-end server platforms. We believe that these innovative products and solutions will have helped Symantec win customers in the last quarter, thus increasing its business volume.Other Stocks that Warrant a LookHere are some other companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these also have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Salesforce.com Inc.

680,CTXS,"Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and Citrix Systems, Inc. (CTXS  -  Free Report)  may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Citrix Systemsis seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings—with the most up-to-date information possible—is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for CTXS in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at 86 cents per share for CTXS, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of 85 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for CTXS, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of 1.18% heading into earnings season.Citrix Systems, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Citrix Systems, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Citrix Systems, Inc. QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market.

681,CTXS,"Citrix Systems Inc. (CTXS  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results on Aug 2, after the market closes.Last quarter, the company recorded a positive earnings surprise of 13.33%. The company surpassed estimates in each of the last four quarters with an average beat of 12.22%. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Citrix is likely to beat estimates this quarter on the back of its perfect combination of two key ingredients.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, stands at +1.18%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is pegged higher at 86 cents than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 85 cents. A favorable Zacks ESP serves as a leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Citrix currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 have significantly higher chances of beating earnings.Conversely, the Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.What is Driving the Better-than-Expected Earnings?Citrix completed the spin-off and merger of its GoTo products with LogMeIn, Inc. (LOGM  -  Free Report) in Feb 2017. We expect these constant product enhancements to be value accretive for the company in the second quarter too. Besides, a centralized management of employee desktops will provide greater security, control and cost savings. This in turn might aid results in the quarter.Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) revenues are expected to repeat its success story by boosting the top line this quarter as well. However, adverse foreign currency movements might hamper results in the second quarter.The company expects net revenues in the band of $685--$695 million for the second quarter. Earnings per share (on an adjusted basis) for the quarter are projected in the range of 97 cents--$1.00. Citrix Systems, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Citrix Systems, Inc.

682,CTXS,"Nokia Corporation’s (NOK  -  Free Report) second-quarter 2017 earnings per share of €0.08 (approximately 9 cents) beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 4 cents. In the year-ago period, the company had reported earnings of €0.03 (4 cents) per share.Net sales declined year over year (on a comparable combined company basis) to €5.6 billion (approximately $6.18 billion). The top line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.98 billion but fell short of the year-ago figure of approximately $6.31 billion. This was because revenues were hurt by the Nokia Networks’ disappointing performance. Also, weakness in the Ultra Broadband Networks subgroup contributed to the soft results posted by Nokia’s flagship division.Quarterly adjusted gross margin was 41.7% in the reported quarter compared with 38.9% a year ago. Operating margin increased 430 basis points (bps) to 10.2% on a year-over-year basis.In fact, at quarter-end, Nokia’s net cash from operating activities was €1,309 million against - €616 million at the end of the year-ago quarter.Segmental RevenuesIn the Nokia Networks segment, total revenue was approximately €4,971 million (around $5,467 million), down 5% year over year. The division includes three reportable sub-units like Ultra Broadband Networks (which includes Mobile Networks and Fixed Networks operations), Global Services (which includes the Global Services business group) and IP Networks and Applications (which includes the IP/Optical Networks and Applications & Analytics operations). Notably, the decline in the Ultra Broadband Networks’ sub-group by 8% to €2,165 million hurt the segmental sales.In fact, net sales declined in all regions, apart from Asia Pacific (5%) and Middle East and Africa (5%), which led to the segment’s below-par performance. The same declined by 16% in Latin America, 7% each in North America and Greater China, and 10% in Europe.However, segmental gross margin improved 150 bps to 39.1% in the reported quarter. Also, quarterly operating margin was 8.2% compared with 6% a year ago.The Nokia Technologies segment’s quarterly total revenue was €369 million (approximately $406 million), up 90% year over year. Segmental gross margin was 95.4% compared with 96.4% in the year-ago quarter. Operating margin expanded significantly to 62.3%.Segmental results were aided by Nokia’s licensing and business partnership deal with Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report). Following the deal, Nokia received an upfront cash payment from Apple in the reported quarter.In Group Common and Other segment, net sales increased 14% to €307 million (approximately $338 million). Segmental gross margin was 17.6%, down 170 basis points. In fact, this division incurred an operating loss in the quarter under review.Nokia Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Nokia Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Nokia Corporation QuoteOutlookNokia officially took control of rival Alcatel-Lucent in Jan 2016, and continues to expect annual cost savings of €1.2 billion in full-year 2018, excluding Nokia Technologies.For 2017, capital expenditure outlook for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company is approximately €500 million. Non-IFRS tax rate is now expected in the range of 25% to 30% in 2017 (old guidance: 30% to 35%). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. The company anticipates net sales in its primary networks division to decline in 2017, which is in line with the primary addressable market. However, the market conditions are expected to be more challenging than expected earlier.Consequently, the primary addressable market for Nokia’s main unit is now expected to decline in the band of 3% to 5% as opposed to the earlier projection of a fall in the low-single digits. Segmental operating margin is still forecasted to be in 8% to 10% range.Our Key Releases Coming upInvestors interested in the Computer and Technology sector will now look forward to the second-quarter earnings reports of Harris Corporation (HRS  -  Free Report) and Citrix Systems (CTXS  -  Free Report).
