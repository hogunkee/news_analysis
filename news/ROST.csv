0,ROST,"Top-rated retailer Ross Stores (ROST) as well as IBD 50 names Twitter (TWTR), TAL Education (TAL) and Momo (MOMO), scored new highs Friday. The latter three are well-extended past proper buy points.But Ross Stores is still in buy range from its handle entry at 84.67. Ross flashed a sell signal from a prior 82.91 entry when it fell 7.8% below the buy point. A key IBD sell rule says to always cut losses at 7% or 8% from your purchase price. Sometimes, a loss can be cut sooner than that.Despite a strong move for the stock in the past 10 years, Ross's latest breakout is still early stage, because the stock reset its base count when it made a big consolidation last year. The low undercut the low of the prior base, shaking enough sellers out to reset the base count. The breakout on Nov. 17 was first stage.Bright Horizons Family Solutions (BFAM) also made the new highs list. The stock looks poised for its third straight gain Friday. It cleared a 105.14 buy point Wednesday in higher volume. It's still within the 5% buy zone, although the market faces some risk.As of Thursday's close, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq showed five distribution days each. Meaningful losses for the major stock indexes in higher volume are a sign of institutional selling. The number of distribution days should always be monitored closely when the market is in a confirmed uptrend — like now.The financial sector also delivered some new highs. Small-cap Cadence Bancorp (CADE) popped above a 30.60 buy point Friday. It's plenty liquid with an average daily volume of more than 1 million shares. It also sports a Composite Rating of 95, which points toward plenty of positive traits from a fundamental perspective. Umpqua Holdings (UMPQ) also hit a new high as it tries to clear a flat base with 24.83 buy point.RELATED:Retail And E-Commerce Stocks And Industry NewsBanks And Financial Stocks News And Analysis

Fueled in recent quarters by leading growth stocks like Apple (AAPL), Adobe Systems (ADBE) and Mastercard (MA), $4 billion Large Cap Growth (GTLLX) and $2.9 billion Large Cap Core (GTLOX) both outperformed the S&P 500 in calendar 2017 as well as over the three, five and 10 years ended Dec. 31.Only 10% of U.S. diversified stock funds with at least $100 million in assets racked up that four-way feat, which makes them winners of the 2018 IBD Best Mutual Funds Award.De Vassal and his team — including managers Paul Sullivan and Alex Attanasiu — have become adept at avoiding behavioral risk in their investment process. Instead, they focus on more than 80 objective yardsticks to measure each growth stock's worthiness. They wear blinders to block out less-meaningful information that can be distractions from data that mark growth stocks poised to advance. Emotions are a major part of behavioral risk, de Vassal says.De Vassal, age 58, talked with IBD about his strategy from his office in Philadelphia.Best Mutual Funds Monthly Performance ReportIBD: How do your growth-oriented mutual funds differ from rival growth funds?De Vassal: First, both funds use a similar process. The difference is the benchmark. For Core, it is the Russell 1000 Index. For Large Cap Growth, it is the Russell Growth. We control industry and sector exposures against those benchmarks.Our strategies are a blend of quantitative discipline based on underlying fundamental insights.IBD: How do you avoid letting emotions interfere with your hunt for growth stocks?De Vassal: We've built a library of factors, over 80, across the two strategies. In any sector, there are about 15 to 25 factors that we use to differentiate stocks. They're a combination of such things as valuation metrics, fundamental metrics and estimate revisions from sell-side analysts. We include some technical indicators as well.IBD: Give me examples of subjective metrics that you avoid.De Vassal: Subjective metrics that we do not use include the popularity of a company — its brand name — and nonquantifiable intangibles such as future products and profits that are not reflected in sell-side analyst earnings or revenue estimates. ... We want to remove behavioral risks that may have adverse effects on portfolio performance.IBD: Limiting downside risk plays a big role in your approach, right?De Vassal: We aim to win by avoiding negative earnings surprises and at the same time tilting more toward stocks that are more likely to have positive surprises.IBD: Basically, the difference between these two funds is that one focuses exclusively on growth stocks while Core Fund can own various types of stocks?De Vassal: In simplest terms, yes. And that means Large Cap Growth has much heavier concentration in technology stocks, for example.IBD: These funds are 2018 IBD Best Mutual Funds Award winners. What does it take to outperform so consistently?De Vassal: We have a very disciplined process. And both portfolios are well diversified. Performance isn't driven by being lucky or unlucky in one or two names. And we try to avoid losers, not just identify winners. We try to improve every year. This year we added two new stock selection factors. One is supply-chain data. The other is ESG (environomental, social and governance) momentum. We've been managing for some form of ESG strategy for over 15 years. We've found ESG momentum works better in some sectors, like consumer staples, consumer discretionary and technology, than in others.IBD: Do you see the iPhone as the key to Apple's future? Or do you see additional services like the App Store, Apple Music and Apple Pay, playing a bigger role?De Vassal: We look at fundamental metrics like return on invested capital. We look at valuation. We look at cash flow per employee. We look at sell-side analysts' earnings estimates, revenue estimates, cash flow estimates. We ask ourselves whether new products and services are causing analysts to increase their estimates. (A sell-side analyst works for an outside firm, not the fund.)We don't have a fundamental analyst kicking the tires on Apple. We look at what's happened in the past. Which (outside) analysts have been the most accurate, looking back nine quarters? Then we look at what they have to say.IBD: Avoiding emotion in your decisions is a key part of your search for growth stocks. What's an example of that?De Vassal: Growth Fund started its stake in Adobe Systems in October. The stock was attractively valued. Later that month they gave (positive) guidance and the stock shot up. We sold in November with a gain over 18%. When a stock moves, we're out because it's no longer attractive.IBD: Mastercard earnings per share growth has accelerated for three quarters. What's your view going forward?De Vassal: We bought it in June 2016. It's done well. It's a holding. We're comfortable with it. But it's not a position we would add to.IBD: You've got Visa (V) as well. Do you like it better?De Vassal: At this point, Visa looks a little more attractive. Mastercard outperformed over the past 12 months, so its valuation is up. Visa's is better. Visa is still a buy for us.IBD: IPG Photonics (IPGP) is another newcomer to Growth Fund. Do you still like it?De Vassal: We started this in August 2017. The valuation was reasonable. Cash flow yield was around 2.4%. Not that strong. But fundamentals were good. Revisions were fairly positive. Price momentum was fairly good. We think revisions are more likely to have positive surprises than negative surprises.IBD: You more than doubled your share count in TD Ameritrade (AMTD) recently. Why?De Vassal: It was September 2017 when we doubled. Its dividend yield was reasonable, and so were its profitability metrics. Analysts were raising their earnings and revenue estimates. It got good (share) price momentum. We've done well with it.IBD: Brick and mortar retailers aren't very popular these days. But you've got discounter Ross Stores (ROST). Why?De Vassal: We still consider it a buy. We've been underweight in consumer discretionary. But we're getting more neutral. Part of the reason is rebalancing the portfolio in industry groups. Looking at Ross' metrics, it's got a healthy combination of valuation, fundamentals and sell-side earnings revisions.IBD: Citrix Systems (CTXS) is in Core Fund. What's driving the speed up in its quarterly EPS growth?De Vassal: It has good profitability metrics. And we've seen more analysts covering the stock, which could lead to increased investors interest.IBD: What's driving the uptrend in CBRE Group (CBRE), which provides property management, loan servicing and origination services?De Vassal: This is one of the best ranked REITs based on our proprietary stock-ranking screens. In terms of metrics, we look at EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) and we look at the consistency of its risk-adjusted growth. Analysts are raising their estimates consistently.IBD: You've trimmed your exposure to Nvidia (NVDA). Does that mean you don't like it as much anymore?De Vassal: We cap a stock's maximum weighting at 2% of Core Fund and 3% of Growth. In contrast, benchmarks are too top heavy. They have too much exposure to the top names.We initially pursued Nvidia in Core in May 2016. The stock had an attractive valuation and improving fundamentals and estimate revisions. Its share price gained a lot, and it bumped our 2% limit so we had to trim it. It has continued up. It's no longer cheap, and it's not a position we would add to.IBD: What has driven the uptrend by F5 Networks (FFIV), which makes data center computing gear?De Vassal: Its valuation isn't cheap, but it's reasonable. Its fundamentals have been strong. Its return on invested capital and cash flow per employee have been favorable vs. its peers. It's got increased coverage from sell-side analysts. So there's a stronger likelihood for positive earnings surprises than some of its peers have.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE:Growth Stocks In Tech And Health Care: Fund Managers Like Their OutlookSee Which Stock The Best Mutual Funds Have Been BuyingU.S. Treasuries Led Bond Funds Higher As 10-Year Yield Tumbled To 2.8%You Need This Much Retirement Savings At Your Age And IncomeFour Ways You Can Cut Spending In Retirement — With Little Lifestyle Sacrifice

Since early December, he said, shares of the department stores he covers had charged roughly 24% higher — excluding JCPenney — compared to a roughly 1% gain for the S&P 500.And he said that first-quarter same-store sales might have been weak due to bad weather in March and April and an earlier Easter holiday.

25,ROST,"Wall Street expects the April jobs report to show the economy added 191,000 new jobs last month as the unemployment rate fell to 4% for the first time since 2000. Yet for stock market investors on edge over Fed rate-hike plans, wage growth is the key number. There's a good chance it will surprise on the upside.Economists expect average hourly wage growth of 2.7% from a year earlier, same as in March. Yet a host of large companies including CVS Health (CVS), Starbucks (SBUX) and Target (TGT) have announced wage hikes rolling out this spring that may start to show up in Friday's report.This year is beginning to look lot like 2016, when wage gains accelerated into summer after Walmart (WMT) hiked its base wage to $10 an hour. Then Target, Costco (COST) and others followed. Walmart's minimum wage hike to $11 an hour has contributed to the same kind of dynamic early this year. Target subsequently hiked its base pay to $12 an hour and CVS to $11 an hour.And as those companies hike wages, their competitors are being pressured to do the same. In March, Kroger (KR), Dollar Tree (DLTR) and Ross Stores (ROST) all said they're raising wages for employees, and their stocks sold off amid worries about profit margins.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseWhat's different from 2016 is that now the jobless rate is nearly a percentage point lower, meaning more competition for workers. On top of that, numerous companies announced wage hikes in the wake of tax reform.The likely combination of low and falling unemployment with accelerating wage gains would fit perfectly with the Phillips curve theory that has long guided Federal Reserve policy. For investors, the key point is that most Fed policymakers still seem confident that inflation pressures won't lag too far behind wage pressures, as businesses pass along a portion of their higher wage bills.To some extent, it's already happening as the Fed's favored gauge of core inflation hit 1.9% in March.

26,ROST,"Deep discount retailer Dollar Tree (DLTR) fell short of fourth-quarter forecasts across the board and gave weak guidance, sinking shares Wednesday. The dollar store is the latest discount chain to sell off after reporting earnings. Costco (COST), meanwhile, pulled ahead of revenue expectations in the afternoon.X Estimates: Profit to grow 37% to $1.90 per share in Q4 as revenue rises 14% to $6.4 billion. Consensus Metrix expects 2.8% same-store sales growth, including 4% comps from flagship Dollar Tree stores and 1.5% comps from Family Dollar locations.Results: EPS of $1.89 on revenue of $6.36 billion. Same-store sales increased 2.4%, including 3.8% growth at Dollar Tree and a 1% gain at Family Dollar.Outlook: Q1 EPS of $1.18 to $1.25, below consensus for $1.32, on revenue of $5.53 billion-$5.63 billion, below consensus of $5.65 billion, with combined same-store sales up by low single digits. Full-year EPS of $5.25-$5.60, below consensus for $5.95, on revenue of $22.7 billion-$23.12 billion, below consensus for $23.41 billion, with combined same-store sales up by low single digits.Stock: Shares plunged 14.5% to 89.25 on the stock market today, tumbling below their 200-day moving average for the first time since late August. Heading into earnings, the stock had hit resistance at its 50-day moving average after breaching the key level in early February. Dollar General (DG) fell 4.3% Wednesday and Five Below (FIVE) dropped 3.6%.Analysts have pointed to dollar stores' resilience against online stores of Amazon's ilk, thanks to their reach into more rural areas and potential consumer benefits from tax reform.But several discount retailers have had a rough earnings season. Off-price apparel retailer Ross Stores (ROST) plunged 6.4% as a cautious outlook overshadowed solid fourth-quarter EPS and sales. Target (TGT) sold off Tuesday after reporting weak holiday earnings and profit guidance, not long after Walmart (WMT) crashed in late February for the same miss-and-warn report.IBD'S TAKE: Buying or holding a stock can be risky heading into an earnings report. Here's an earnings options strategy that can help you cash in on post-earnings stock gains, while minimizing the risk from a weak quarter.Estimates: Earnings to rise 24% to $1.45 per share on 10% sales growth to $32.71 billion. Core same-store sales, minus gas and the impact of foreign exchange, are expected to rise 5.5%, per Consensus Metrix. Including those elements, analysts are expecting comp growth of 7.5% globally.Results: Diluted earnings of of $1.59 a share on $32.995 billion in revenue, including membership fees. But minus a 17-cent per-share benefit from changes in the tax laws, Costco earned $1.42 per share, short of views.Excluding gas and foreign exchange, comps grew 5.4%.  Including gas and foreign exchange, comps rose 8.4%.Stock: Costco initially rallied, but then turned fractionally lower. The stock closed down 2.1% to 187.36 during the regular session. The stock has a flat base with a 199.98 buy point as it bobs around its 50-day line.Results from the membership-based wholesaler come amid a backdrop of battling among the major retailers: namely, Walmart and Amazon. Both are working hard to get products to shoppers faster, and Walmart's Sam's Club, a rival to Costco, has joined forces with Instacart to offer same-say delivery.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN: Best Chinese Stocks To Buy And WatchRetail & E-Commerce Stocks And Industry NewsStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

32,ROST,"Among Carillon Scout Mid Cap Fund's (UMBMX) holdings, such stocks as Abiomed (ABMD), Arista Networks (ANET) and Comerica (CMA) are providing enough lift to keep the fund ahead of its midcap blend fund peers and within shouting distance of the S&P 500.X The fund is down 0.37% this year as of Feb. 28 vs. a 0.87% decline by its midcap blend peers tracked by Morningstar Direct and a 1.83% gain by the S&P 500.But it's the fund's longer-term performance that catches the eye. It's outperformed both its peers the S&P 500 in the past one, three, five and 10 years ended Dec. 31. It rose 24.02%, and an average annual 14.17%, 16.35% and 11.13% in the past three, five and 10 years.Former Air Force B-52 bomber crew member Patrick Dunkerley and his co-managers oversee the top performing mutual fund. In an interview with IBD, Dunkerley credited the strong showing to his investment team, their disciplined investment process that combines fundamental, marco economic and technical analysis, as well as a flexible valuation approach.IBD: You not only beat peer midcap funds in the past 1, 3, 5 and 10 years, but you also beat the S&P 500 in that period, one of only 16 mid cap funds to do so. What's behind the strong performance in both short term and long term?Track Top Stocks And Market Trends With Free IBD NewslettersPatrick Dunkerley: We are fortunate to have performed well over many years and different time periods. We seek to generate good risk-adjusted returns as measured against our benchmark, the Russell Midcap Index.  I credit our team members, including our team chemistry plus our disciplined investment process for this sustained performance.Co-managers Derek Smashey and John Indellicate have been with us since inception in 2006, and co-manager Jason Votruba joined us in 2013, along with senior analysts Craig West following health care and Eric Chenoweth following energy and utilities, who joined us in 2016 and 2017 respectively.Our investment process is unique because we incorporate both top-down macroeconomic and company specific analysis, with an emphasis on quality stocks, and a flexible valuation approach, which changes depending if market conditions are bullish or bearish.IBD: The biggest exposure has been to tech, consumer cyclical, financial services and industrials. What do you see the source of performance in the balance of this year? What macro trends are affecting your decisions?Dunkerley: Healthy leading indicators, good credit availability, adequate money supply growth, and an upward slope to the U.S. Treasury yield curve all support our bullish equity view at the moment, but increased volatility seems likely given the market sentiment is adjusting to higher interest rates.  From a sector point of view, we are sticking with investments in cyclical companies for now, with an emphasis on technology, financials — including banks and insurance companies that benefit from higher interest rates, industrials, materials, and energy as strong U.S. and global growth is lifting earnings.The consumer discretionary sector is enjoying a new tailwind, with retail sales coming in stronger than expected, and more earnings performance likely as the U.S. tax cuts and wage increases stimulate growth.  We believe stock selection is important so we own deep discounters such as Ross Stores (ROST), or other retailers than can blunt the effect of online competition.  In addition, consumer companies offering unique experiences such as Live Nation Entertainment (LYV) benefit as millennial consumers seek entertainment, such as live concerts.We believe U.S. inflation will increase and the dollar should continue to be soft if risk-on investor sentiment prevails in 2018.Our position in gold miner Newmont Mining (NEM) helps to insulate the portfolio from a gradually declining U.S. dollar, and should capture benefits from an improving gold price due to curtailed capital spending in the gold mining industry. The company pays a 1.4% cash dividend yield, and has unhedged exposure to the gold price.Stronger defense spending funded by the recent federal budget should help companies like Harris (HRS), a leader in military radios. In addition, companies like Hexcel (HXL) and Xylem (XYL) are profiting from global growth in aircraft demand and the need for better water treatment, respectively.We expect equity markets to rise further, but, if credit conditions turn bearish due to an overly aggressive Federal Reserve, then we would become more defensively positioned.  This will eventually happen, but it's not happening at the moment and we believe bullish conditions for U.S. equities are intact, despite the recent volatility in the markets.IBD: Where are we in the small cap, mid cap and large cap cycle of outperformance/underperformance?Dunkerley: We think mid caps are set up for competitive performance with the other capitalization categories. For the trailing 10 years ended Dec. 31, 2017, U.S. midcaps and small caps have outperformed their large-cap cousins, as measured by the various Russell indexes, with midcaps generating the best returns over that time period.  This midcap outperformance is consistent with longer-term historical data dating back to 1979, although we would caution that mid caps do not outperform in every time period.For example, last year, the large caps outperformed.  But, given the long-term historical outperformance of U.S. midcaps, they deserve a premium valuation and currently they do trade at a slight premium to large caps, based on forward looking (estimated) price-to-earnings ratios.  We believe the recent outperformance of large caps was driven by a valuation discount that was too wide.  But that discount has narrowed.IBD: Do you buy only midcap companies or will you buy large caps and small caps as long as they don't lift or lower the average market cap above or below midcap?Dunkerley: We seek to buy stocks within the market capitalization range of our benchmark, the Russell Midcap Index, with particular emphasis on companies with greater than a $2 billion market capitalization as they are often more liquid.IBD: What's your process for buying stocks? Do you start with screening for fundamentals?Dunkerley: We believe an active approach can outperform the benchmark by choosing higher-quality stocks, and by employing both top-down and bottom-up portions of our research process.  We follow over 150 economic indicators on a weekly basis, and we employ a toolbox approach to valuation, utilizing different tools during a bull market cycle to measure upside potential of a stock, while paying more attention to downside valuation risk during bear markets.We believe a good understanding of the macroeconomic picture helps us to more effectively position the portfolio sector weights, which are important.In addition, our bottom up research checklist helps us to identify the fundamentally strong companies with favorable financial characteristics, undervaluation, good business models, effective management, and that are free from serious litigation risks.IBD: How big a role does technical analysis play in your selection process?Dunkerley:  We do look at charts, particularly as an aid for timing of trades, or to help better understand the fundamental picture at a company.  Some of the ""cheapest"" stocks in the long run, in other words the best long-term investments from my experience, are found making new highs.We don't have to be the first to buy or sell a stock in order to be successful, as significant moves up or down can often be long lasting.  So quite often, the market will ""discover"" a stock as evidenced by strong price action seen in the chart. We just have to do the fundamental work to make sure the investment is sustainable. We also buy stocks that are experiencing price corrections if we think they have the quality characteristics we seek, so we are not exclusively buying stocks near highs.IBD's TAKE: Many of the top performing stocks in the past were trading at new price highs and above-average P-Es before they made the biggest gains of their run-ups. IBD: What are your sell rules?Dunkerley: Our process is to sell a stock due to a negative change in the fundamentals, problematic valuation, if we find a better investment alternative, or to manage our portfolio characteristics. One advantage of active management is the ability to seek to sell stocks with weakening fundamentals before the bad news is fully reflected in the stock price, so we strive to act decisively when our thesis changes.IBD: Do you spend much time talking with company management or do balance sheet and earnings report tell you what you need to know?Dunkerley: We believe the numbers reported by companies are one of the most important clues in securities analysis, determining the quality of the business, spotting trends, and evaluating the effectiveness of management. Good investment practice involves a thorough understanding of the cash flow statement and balance sheet, in addition to the income statement. We believe too many investors ignore the former and emphasize the latter, and this causes problems particularly during bear markets.However, we also like to invest with good management teams, and our investment team meets with various company managements nearly every week, or sees them at conferences in order to better size up their strategies and abilities.We also read conference call transcripts to deepen our understanding of the businesses and better understand the strategy of management, in addition to face-to-face meetings.Finally, competitive dynamics are always important and we seek to own companies we perceive as having a sustainable advantage so they can better protect profits and grow, such as a unique products or strong industry position, new product cycle, or management skill.  But we don't exclude commodity businesses that we think are experiencing an upcycle in fundamentals.IBD: Do you have a standard size, steps or range for beginning positions?Dunkerley: We often ramp a new position to at least 50 basis points (half of 1%) of the portfolio fairly quickly.IBD: Your portfolio is quite diversified with 154 stocks and 18% in the top 10 and no stock account for more than a little above 3%. How do you manage your winners?Dunkerley: We let winners run when it seems prudent to do so, although we often trim the position if we think the upside move is overdone. Our forward-looking valuation tool, the discounted earnings model helps us to gauge upside potential in a stock, primarily during bull markets.We build these for each stock we invest in, it's part of our fundamental analysis. So if we notice a stock discounting too much of its future potential, we will often trim it down or swap into another stock. This is another advantage of active management over passive, when properly executed.IBD: What strategy do you have for lagging stocks that were put into the portfolio with expectations of superior gains but become a drag on portfolio performance?Dunkerley: Our sell discipline is well defined, and has helped us to outperform our Russell Midcap benchmark by controlling downside risk. We will sell or trim a stock when we detect fundamental deterioration in the business outlook, or if we determine that high valuation is an outsized risk. Each of our team members covers one or more sectors of the market, and we emphasize looking at the downside risks all of the time, but especially prior to each quarterly earnings report.So we do a lot of work detecting and analyzing downside risk factors in the stocks we own. It's an ongoing project, and we seek to avoid complacency regarding the fundamentals or the valuation. Keeping tabs on stocks we already own is the majority of the work we do typically.IBD: Turning to a few of your top holdings, DXC (DXC) has run up 50% since last April and is trading at all-time highs near 103, with a market cap of $29 billion. What do you like about the Hewlett Packard Enterprise spinoff? Sales are down and it's expected to post its first profit in five years. And does the stock have more room to run, or is it getting too rich — and its market cap too big?Dunkerley: A clearer picture of the earnings history can be found under the former ticker CSC. On a GAAP basis, the company was profitable four out of the past five years.  The top end of the market capitalization range of the Russell Midcap Index is currently near $40 billion, so a $29 billion market cap company is a midcap company as currently defined by Russell.We think the stock is cheap at under 7X total enterprise value to EBITDA if you look two years out, and Mike Lawrie, the CEO there has a great track record of delivering earnings progress, and positive shareholder actions such as special dividends and spinoffs.  If they successfully spinoff the government technology services business, that will be the second time he has accomplished a spinoff since 2015, back when it was named Computer Sciences and they spun off CSRA, another government services technology business.They also paid a $10.50 per share special dividend that year, so a repeat in 2018 of a special dividend would be sweet, but we can't forecast that.This is not a rapid top-line growth situation, it is more about rationalizing the business and managing it more efficiently, so margins can expand.  The recent merger with Hewlett-Packard Enterprise Services gives Lawrie a bigger platform to work with. This is one of the best CEOs in America today, we think. So this is an investment in good management execution in what is a competitive technology services industry. We have owned this stock for many years and it has performed terrifically for shareholders.IBD: Abiomed has also run up, but it continues to post big earnings increases. What's the potential for this stock and what are the risks?Dunkerley: For the long term, we think Abiomed has great prospects.  They have a strong competitive position in small heart pumps for cardiac surgeries. We think the available possible total market (TAM) for these pumps could be as much as an estimated 500 thousand units globally over time, although we don't expect Abiomed to capture all of that market, as few companies ever do that and competition almost always surfaces at some point.We estimate their unit volumes just passed the 24,000 annualized run rate, so there is a long potential runway to this story. Their products are life savers in the hands of a well-trained cardiac surgeon, and they are expanding overseas.The risks in a stock like this are usually competition, which is developing slowly, high statistical valuation that can lead to a correction in the stock, or some type of unexpected flaw in the technology, or poor execution. Since their devices are approved and used in the U.S., Japan, and Germany, among others, and they have great sales and profit momentum, we view the latter risk as low. The stock has had a great run so it could be a better one to buy on pullbacks.IBD:  Atmos Energy (ATO) is 12% off its high and looking for a bottom. What's your thinking on this stock's prospects at this point?Dunkerley: This is a quality utility company, serving the lower-risk market of regulated gas utility service, with a service footprint in eight states including a large presence in Texas.  Regulated utilities offer a better safety profile in our opinion than many industries, so we have owned them in size from time to time when the cycle is right, such as when we expect interest rates to be stable or falling.Atmos has an excellent safety record, which helps them to gain favor with state regulators, and that has driven better than average earnings growth. They also maintain a conservative balance sheet, which we like.Atmos may be one of the few utilities that keeps a chunk of their tax savings from the recent corporate tax cuts, due to potential favorable treatment in Texas, where 70% of their assets are located. However, that is a developing situation and will depend on political outcomes, never a certainty.The main concern with the stock now is the direction of interest rates, which have moved higher.  So Atmos has moved down with the utility sector. Our weighting in utilities is underweight currently vs. the benchmark due to our outlook for higher interest rates.IBD: What happened to Arista Networks that it's 22% off its all-time high after beating earnings estimates? How do you handle a stock like this?Dunkerley: Arista is a share taker in the fast-growing switch market for cloud infrastructure. However after a big run-up, the stock has pulled back, possibly due to what we perceive as conservative guidance by management. We think Arista's advantages are in their software and management expertise, so we are confident in their long-term outlook. Enterprises are rapidly shifting workloads to the cloud and Arista's networking software was built for this environment.IBD: What's your favorite stock at this point, the one with potential to deliver the strongest performance?Dunkerley: For the near to intermediate term, I would have to go with DXC Technologies, our largest holding due to its low valuation and potential operating margin improvement, the potential for a spinoff, and or another special dividend. The global macroeconomic background is favorable for technology companies at the moment, with decent economic growth in many areas of the world, a change from a few years back.Finally, technology spending is a capital expenditure which we think can do well in the middle to late part of an economic cycle, since we believe companies are more likely to spend on technology systems when they feel better about their financial prospects. The recent corporate tax cut in the U.S. helps reinforce our point of view on this, we believe.  However, for the long-term, Abiomed may have the greatest upside potential due to reasons previously mentioned.IBD: Where did you serve in the Air Force, and are there any aspects of serving in the military that translate well to money management?Dunkerley: I served in B-52 bomber units, and was stationed in Maine and California. Military service is good at fostering teamwork and communications skills, and the ability to perform under stress. I enjoyed my time of service and learned a great deal.RELATED:Look Who's Replacing This Top Fidelity Manager During His LeaveWhat's The Stock Market Doing Now?

50,ROST,"In Wall Street's eyes, retailers not named Amazon (AMZN) stunk in 2017, until they didn't, buoyed toward the end of the year by holiday hopes and anticipated corporate tax-cut benefits.X Now that the eggnog and bubbly have worn off and we're beginning to see which stores really felt the Christmas spirit, what can we expect from a sector challenged by a massive cultural shift in the way people shop? Does 2018 spell more doom for your neighborhood mall, or a turning point for brick-and-mortar shops?The ""retail Armageddon narrative can moderate in 2018 as better holiday season results demonstrate that a good balance of bricks & clicks can yield growth,"" wrote Baird analysts.But if Macy's (M) and J.C. Penney's (JCP) solid November-December results – but crummy stock reaction – tell us anything, it's that not everyone has faith that one good retail Christmas can translate into continued momentum through the brand new year.""It's amazing – everybody is so short-sighted,"" NPD Group retail analyst Marshal Cohen told IBD, adding that the holidays have ""nothing to do with the success of 2018. (It's) a statement into the consumer psyche at the time.""The key festive season can account for up to 30% of some retailers' revenue for the entire year, per National Retail Federation calculations. Retail Metrics says December same-store sales are up 10.3% as of Monday, better than consensus for 7.2% comps.But thanks to aggressive discounting and year-round promotions, selling a lot of goods doesn't necessarily translate to a lot of profit for stores.And that ""false read on good news"" could lead to a ""lot of bad news and challenging news come February,"" said Cohen, as shoppers close up their wallets after chucking out the tree and taking down the lights.""Nowadays, you could be so far in the hole that a good holiday is just going to basically break you even,"" he told IBD. ""And does it mean good momentum going into the next? No. You're as good as your last sale was.""Expect more consolidation and store closures. In fact, commercial real estate services giant Cushman & Wakefield estimates more than 11,000 closures this year, a jump from last year's 9,000 shuttered storefronts.So far in 2018, Macy's has already named 11 more of the 100 stores it's in the process of closing. And Sears Holding (SHLD) on Thursday announced a deathblow to over 100 Kmart and Sears stores, as the storied department store chain, once the nation's largest retailer, continues to cling on for life.But closing a few doors isn't a bad thing, per se, in this ""over-stored"" America filled with dead malls and an abundance of shops and half-hearted foot traffic. Savvy brick-and-mortar retailers are instead beefing up their digital side in order to take on Amazon, as well as each other.""The market shouldn't ignore all traditional retailers and fawn all over Amazon and other digitally native companies,"" wrote Jefferies retail analyst Randal Konik in a Tuesday report. He said that brick-and-mortar stores' efforts to shutter stores and improve their e-commerce operations ""should lead to profit margin stabilization and improving (free cash flow) over the next 12 months.""Even department stores, despite all the murmurs about the death of the mall, should be fine.Konik sees potential headwinds for Macy's and J.C. Penney this year, ""given the success click-to-brick players have had in apparel/accessories,"" but also highlighted the steps department stores have taken to adapt, such as Kohl's (KSS) partnership with Amazon.""We keep waiting for the shoe to drop on a couple of retailers, the J.C. Penneys and the Sears,"" Cohen said. ""But you know, again, if they can make it through '15 and '16, they can certainly make it through '17.""But there's a lot of debt coming due in the next two to three years, Retail Metrics head Ken Perkins told IBD in December. It's ""hard to imagine a retailer being able to grow their business enough to grow a cash flow strong enough to pay off high debt levels.""Who's most likely to run into trouble this year? Mid-size specialty chains, predicts Cohen.Wal-Mart (WMT) gets its fair share of kudos for focusing on its digital operations, starting with the acquisition of Jet.com in 2016 and continuing with the pickup of a handful of online players such as ModCloth, Bonobos, Moosejaw and ShoeBuy last year. That, combined with its forward-looking tests – in-fridge delivery, anyone? – and competitive measures have given it decent Street cred against Amazon.Off-price retailers such as TJX (TJX) should do well, say experts, who mostly still have faith in the ""treasure hunt"" vibe that stores like Ross Stores (ROST) and Burlington Stores (BURL) emanate. In the clothing space, few things appear more Amazon-proof to research firm Cowen than a bargain bin filled with the promise of discounted brand names.Cowen analyst Oliver Chen hails T.J. Maxx and Marshalls parent TJX as his ""best idea"" for the year, and believes off-pricers as a whole will continue to grab market share from department stores and other full-price peers. He holds an outperform rating and recently increased price target of 88 on TJX.""In a challenging retail environment where most retailers are seeing traffic declines, off-price is driving traffic gains,"" wrote Jefferies' Konik, who has a hold rating on TJX and Ross Stores. ""This has led to strong, consistent comparable sales performance and well-controlled inventories in the channel, as their wide and shallow inventories rapidly turn to give shoppers something new and fresh to discover with every visit.""But Konik offers a word of caution. He sees an ""imminent"" threat in Amazon, and says off-price retailers' lack of a proper online presence – irregular inventory and e-commerce listings don't exactly go hand in hand – ""will eventually take a toll.""Smart-speaker/AI technology could be the next big thing to upend regular old commerce.Research firm Magid says voice-enabled commerce and artificial intelligence tools have ""the potential to disrupt and disintermediate retail and manufacturing.""That may leave retailers out in the cold if manufacturers go directly to consumers. In fact, packaged goods companies ""will either merge or forward integrate and acquire retail, as they realize a voice-controlled world is really, really bad for them,"" predicted L2's Scott Galloway in late December.Cowen's Chen believes voice recognition, which should reach 25%-30% penetration, will be the next mobile phone. ""Retailers will need to interject themselves into the smart and connected home and find ways to make their brands relevant to frequent audio interaction despite the challenges of lack of visual cues,"" he said in a Dec. 26 note to clients.Chen also predicts that ""previously unlikely consolidation will occur,"" and that Wal-Mart and Target (TGT) ""will undergo a cycle of M&A in order to develop customer capabilities similar to AMZN.""Loup Ventures even believes Amazon will acquire Target, calling it the ""ideal offline partner for Amazon"" because of its ""shared demographic and manageable but comprehensive store count.""Analysts tend to have mixed emotions about Target, pegging it either as a distant third wheel in the Amazon-Wal-Mart war, or a contender making some smart moves. NPD's Cohen falls into the latter camp, highlighting Target's recent acquisition of same-day delivery company Shipt, its holiday performance and private-label successes in apparel.""I think Target is going to be a huge winner,"" he said.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:How Private Labels Could Be Amazon, Target's Next Cash CowRetail And E-Commerce News And Stocks To WatchAmazon Holds Prime Position With Record 60 Million Subscribers

51,ROST,"Futures for the S&P 500 index rose modestly Wednesday morning. Retail stocks and groups were market leaders Tuesday, with Macy's (M), Kohl's (KSS) among the big winners, with Wal-Mart (WMT) moving closer to a buy. Meanwhile, Apple (AAPL) was a big laggard, dragging down chip stocks such as Micron Technology (MU) and Broadcom (AVGO), while Facebook (FB) continues to struggle.X What's more surprising is that this is not a one-day phenomenon. Left for dead for much of the year, retailers have come roaring back, especially during the holiday shopping season. Meanwhile, Apple, chips and FANG stocks have been lackluster to down.S&P 500 index futures rose 0.2% vs. fair value. Nasdaq 100 futures and Dow futures climbed nearly 0.2% vs. fair value.The Retail-Department Store group rose 3.5% on Tuesday, leading all 197 industries tracked by IBD. Macy's climbed 4.6% and Kohl's 6%. Retail-Apparel/Shoes/Accessories popped 1.8%, Gap (GPS), Ross Stores (ROST), Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF) among the strong performers. Triggering Tuesday's move: Holiday retail sales rose the most since 2011, according to Mastercard Advisors.But since the Thankgiving holiday, the S&P Retail Index has climbed 6%, IBD's Department Store group has popped 22% and the Retail-Apparel/Shoes/Accessories industry has rallied 17%.Retailers aren't offering many potential buy points. Wal-Mart is a big exception, rising 1% Tuesday to just 1% off a new entry. But most retail stocks are already extended — like Gap, Five Below (FIVE) and Ollie's Bargain Outlet (OLLI) — or rebounding from a long slump like Kohl's.Will retail continue to outperform? On the upside, unemployment continues to drift lower while wage gains appear to be picking up, especially for blue-collar workers. The Trump tax cuts also could give a modest boost to discretionary income. On the downside, brick-and-mortar retailers may have bested expectations, but many are still fighting an uphill battle in e-commerce, where Amazon dominates and Wal-Mart is a serious player.Meanwhile, Apple has fallen 3% over that span. So has Facebook. (As for Facebook's FANG peers, Netflx (NFLX) lost 4%, Alphabet (GOOGL) 1% and Amazon (AMZN) up 2%.)The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index has sunk 5%, while IBD's Semiconductor-Equipment group has skidded 11%.Much of Apple's loss came Tuesday, with the tech titan falling 2.5% as some analysts cut iPhone X demand estimates.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:The Big Picture: Did Options Flash A Warning Sign?Wal-Mart, Apple Lead These 4 Dow Giants Just Below Buy PointsFANG Stocks: Will They Show Their Teeth In 2018?How To Invest In The Stock Market: Start With A Simple Routine

108,ROST,"Here's your Investing Action Plan for Tuesday: what you need to know as an investor for the day ahead.XAfter last week's department-store slump, more retailers are gearing up to report. And even though Home Depot (HD), TJX (TJX), Coach (COH), Urban Outfitters (URBN) and Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) compete in separate categories — home improvement, off-price clothing, handbags, millennial apparel, athletic goods — there's little doubt that online behemoth Amazon and the broader shifting retail landscape are, to some degree, impacting them all.Analysts see the home-improvement retailer's Q2 per-share profit rising 12% to $2.21 on 5% revenue growth to $27.8 billion, according to Zacks Investment Research.Look for possible talk on the earnings call about Sears Holding's (SHLD) recent decision to sell Kenmore appliances on Amazon (AMZN). Home-improvement retailers such as Home Depot and Lowe's (LOW), which are big appliance sellers, sold off initially on that news. The sector generally has been  seen as having more of a buffer from the power of the e-commerce giant — but Amazon's foray into groceries, fashion and a host of other areas are enough to give retailers the jitters every time it makes a move.Shares dipped 0.4% to 154.26 in Monday's stock market trading. Home Depot, a Dow industrials component, is in a flat base with a 160.96 buy point.The T.J. Maxx and Marshalls parent is expected to report flat year-over-year EPS of 84 cents and 6% revenue gains to $8.32 billion.Off-price stores are another group that have, in the past, been labeled ""Amazon-proof"" as department stores struggle to adapt to a digital-first shopping environment. But growth has slowed for TJX and other off-price chains. Look for signs of continued resilience or potential chipping in its report. Off-price peer Ross Stores (ROST) reports later in the week.Shares fell 2.1% to 69.58. The stock is still trying to recover from a sharp sell-off that started in May.Purse and accessories maker Coach is seen growing profit by 9% to 49 cents a share while sales are expected to dip 0.7% to $1.15 billion.Handbag brands are in the midst of expanding their fashion houses, with Coach completing its $2.4 billion acquisition of Kate Spade last month, and competitor Michael Kors (KORS) announcing in late July that it's gobbling up luxury shoe brand Jimmy Choo.Coach, Kors and others have had to tangle with discounting at department stores as they try to maintain an image of accessible luxury.Cultivating demand with millennial and Gen Z consumers also appears to be a priority for Coach: Pop star Selena Gomez is the latest face of the brand.Shares rose 0.7% to 47.90, near three-year highs.Speaking of young people, Urban Outfitters is projected to report a 44% profit decline to 37 cents a share on a 3% sales dip to $864 million.Specialty teen-apparel retailers have been particularly hard-hit in recent years, as younger consumers gravitate toward experiences and clothing sales remain soft. In early June, Urban Outfitters said that its same-store sales for the second quarter, which it is set to report on Tuesday, were then already ""high-single-digit negative.""Cowen has long forecast that Amazon will unseat Macy's (M) as the nation's largest apparel retailer this year.Urban Outfitters shares fell 0.2% to 17.73, still near recent eight-year lows.Consensus is for 23% EPS growth on nearly 11% sales gains to $2.18 billion.The athleticwear and sporting-goods retailer — which carries Nike (NKE), Under Armour (UAA), Adidas (ADDYY) and other popular brands — was just one company whose stock took a hit in late June on news that Nike would be selling some of its footwear on Amazon.Dick's shares rose 2.7% to 34.91, but are near their worst levels since early 2012.Hibbett Sporting Goods (HIBB) and Foot Locker (FL) report later this week.Here's one company reporting Tuesday that's not like the others listed here. Wall Street expects China-based automotive online platform BitAuto (BITA) to post 22 cents EPS on $278.25 million in revenue, according to Yahoo Finance estimates.While still off its 2014 peak, the stock hit a two-year high on Monday, up 6.4% to 39.28.Rival Autohome (ATHM) reported strong results last week.RELATED:Giants Of China's Internet, U.S. Retail Lead Investing Action Plan J.C.

110,ROST,"Sears Holdings (SHLD) shot up Thursday after announcing that it is selling Kenmore appliances via Amazon.com (AMZN), including Alexa-enabled smart appliances, a team-up that comes after years of struggle to compete against the e-commerce giant.XBut the news also triggered a broad sell-off in home improvement chains Home Depot (HD) and Lowe's (LOW), along with Best Buy (BBY). All three are big sellers of appliances.""This marks the broadest distribution of Kenmore, America's most trusted home appliance brand, outside of Sears branded stores and related online retail platforms,"" Sears said in a statement. Terms of the deal weren't disclosed.The move follows Sears' deal in January to sell its Craftsman line of tools to Stanley Black & Decker (SWK) and comes amid questions about Sears' future, after warnings earlier this year about its ability to continue as a going concern.Meanwhile, Amazon is expanding its reach in traditional brick-and-mortar retail and agreed to acquire Whole Foods Market (WFM) last month.Sears shares were up 10.6% to 9.60 in the stock market today, near session lows after spiking to 10.76 in the morning. The stock vaulted above its 200-day moving average for the first time in two months.Amazon rose 0.2% to 1,028.70, hitting a fresh record high earlier.Home Depot sank 4.1% on the news, crashing through the bottom of its current consolidation to a three-month low. Lowe's dived 5.6%, plunging through its 200-day line to a six-month low. Home improvement chains had been seen as Amazon-proof, or at least-resistant, but the e-commerce giant's reach continues to expand.Electronics retailer Best Buy lost 3.9% to 53.96. Best Buy was hit earlier this month on news that Amazon is setting up a nascent rival to Geek Squad.Appliance maker Whirlpool (WHR) lost 3.4%.The Sears-Amazon deal follows news late last month that athletic apparel giant Nike (NKE) would sell directly on Amazon's site. Nike shares spiked on that news, along with a solid earnings report.As they try to adapt to an increasingly connected form of shopping, retailers like Sears, Macy's (M) and J.C. Penney (JCP) have struggled to match the online convenience provided by Amazon. The danger posed by the e-commerce giant has escalated as it moves further into fashion and furniture.Value retail chains like TJX (TJX), Burlington Stores (BURL) and Ross Stores (ROST) also threaten the department stores' sales and traffic.Kenmore Smart connected room air conditioners, integrated with Alexa, are now available, with plans to expand the full product line onto Amazon. Kenmore, Sears Home Services and Innovel Solutions will provide delivery, installation, and other extended warranties.The collaboration with Amazon is ""perfectly aligned with our omni-channel strategy,"" said Tom Park, president of the Kenmore, Craftsman and DieHard brands at Sears.""This collaboration is the first of its kind for Kenmore,"" he said in the announcement, ""broadening its accessibility to the next generation of American families outside of Sears branded retail channels.""CFRA analyst Efraim Levy wrote that news of the Amazon-Sears deal could ""slow or even reverse some appliance market share gains"" for Home Depot and Lowe's, as he believes the home-improvement retailers have gained from Sears' loss of customers.But he said he still believed Home Depot and Lowe's were ""Amazon-resistant,"" given their customer assistance and growing focus on professional customers.RELATED:Nike Breaks Out As Analyst Sees Accelerating Growth

111,ROST,"Amazon's (AMZN) Whole Foods (WFM) acquisition, the launch of Prime Wardrobe, and Nike's (NKE) decision to sell directly on the e-commerce site have shaken up the grocery and broader retail space, but recent sell-offs could actually prompt ""more investable"" opportunities in retail, says one analyst.X ""Although it may take time for investors to be willing to re-enter the space, we believe this may actually have made the 'winners' within our retail/brands coverage (which have already been coping through the Amazon threat) more investable,"" wrote Instinet analyst Simeon Siegel on Monday, arguing that apparel ""is no 'deader' than it was two weeks ago.""Who are the Amazon-resistant names on his list? Ulta Beauty (ULTA), TJX (TJX), Ross Stores (ROST), Nike and Signet Jewelers (SIG). Ralph Lauren (RL) is also seen potentially benefiting.""With fewer 'safe havens' across the broader consumer landscape, multiple premiums around anything thought to be 'safe' will likely be reinforced,"" he said.Amazon closed down 1% at 993.98 in the stock market today. Ulta finished 1.8% higher, TJX added 1%, Ross gained 0.7%, Nike rose 0.8%, and Signet climbed 3.2%.And while Amazon's foray into ""try before you buy""-style at-home shopping with Prime Wardrobe treads further onto department store and apparel retailers' turf, Siegel wonders if the offering could actually be a boost for brands, given the number of store closures happening on the brick-and-mortar level.The additional distribution provided by Amazon, of all places, could help offset lost distribution at department stores, he said.IBD's TAKE: Meanwhile, Amazon chief Jeff Bezos and other tech heads met with India Prime Minister Narendra Modi ahead of Modi's meeting with President Trump on Monday. For the latest on FANG stocks, check out IBD's hub on all things Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google. Nike, Under Armour (UAA), Adidas (ADDYY), PVH (PVH), Ralph Lauren, and Hanes Brands (HBI), which have wide wholesale distribution to department stores ""could stand to gain the most from syncing up with the Amazon machine, as the site's success could provide a new form of wholesale distribution, offering some protection from the structural challenges facing the current establishment,"" Siegel added.Furthermore, he said wider apparel distribution on Amazon would actually help to bolster full-price retail and thereby protect off-pricers like TXJ and Ross Stores.RELATED:Wal-Mart Is Not Mulling A Rival Bid For Whole Foods: ReportHere's The Latest Group Having An Amazon-Induced Anxiety Attack

The S&P 500 dropped 0.7%, while the Dow Jones industrial average drifted down 0.3%. Preliminary data showed volume on both exchanges coming in higher than Monday's levels.West Texas intermediate crude dropped to just above $43 a barrel as oil sloughed off another 2%, undercutting a May low to settle at its lowest point since November. But a move that would've sent oil-related stocks crowding the lowest slots on the Dow and S&P 500 barely even registered.   Chevron (CVX) and Exxon Mobil (XOM) dropped less than 1%.  Oil stocks posted only five of the day's 20 worst losses among S&P 500 stocks.General Electric (GE) was the Dow's worst performer, down 2% in weak trade.  Apple (AAPL) tumbled 0.8%, and all four of the FANG stocks ended lower, despite a price target increase for Netflix (NFLX).Medicals, drugmakers and biotechs posted a strong session. Merck (MRK) and Pfizer (PFE) easily topped the Dow industrials, up 1.5% and 1.4%, respectively.  IBD 50 stock Regeneron Pharmaceutical (REGN) and Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) led both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100. (Biotechs and drugmakers took the day's top seven gains among Nasdaq 100 stocks.)Regeneron surged 5% to reach a 17-month high, despite Novartis (NVS) reporting its RTH258 macular degeneration drug had outperformed Regeneron's Eylea in a head-to-head clinical trial.

Management downplayed how much of that benefit came from the acquisitions of Moosejaw and ModCloth during the quarter, saying most of that was organic growth at Walmart.com.""The acquisitions have received a lot of attention, but our plan in e-commerce is not to buy our way to success,"" said Wal-Mart CEO Doug McMillon on the earnings call. ""The majority of our growth is and will be organic. The acquisitions are helping us speed some things up.""CFO Brett Biggs later added that plans were in the works to ramp up online-segment growth and drive in-store traffic. Gross merchandise volume rose about 69%, including acquisitions, he said, calling it ""extraordinary growth.""Globally, Wal-Mart's e-commerce growth had already accelerated to 29% in Q4 from 20.6% in Q3, 11.8% in Q2 and 7% in Q1 a year ago.As rival Target is in the midst of revving up its own digital engine, Wal-Mart has moved aggressively, acquiring Jet.com last year as well as Shoebuy this year, in addition to Moosejaw and ModCloth. It is also reportedly in talks to acquire menswear label Bonobos.""The positive impact of Jet.com on the online business is significant, with our view that the level of acceleration will continue to widen the gap between Wal-Mart and its brick-and-mortar competitors,"" said Moody's Lead Analyst Charlie O'Shea via email.And Cowen's Oliver Chen sees Wal-Mart, which now offers two-day shipping for $35 purchases and discounts for picking up online items in store, gnashing its teeth to gain turf online.""Competitive weapons vs. Amazon should include training and development of 225,000 associates and 100 training academies, 90% of the United States is within 10 miles of a store, and online grocery is available at 670 locations,"" he wrote. Chen has an outperform rating and 83 price target on the stock.Shares of Wal-Mart rallied 3.2% to a two-year high of 77.54 on the stock market today.

Retailers, energy plays and some hot growth stocks led the market amid earnings reports and higher oil prices. But solar stocks tumbled on weak SunPower (SPWR) guidance. REITs struggled as investors sought growth names -- and worried about store closures.Alibaba reported revenue of $4.84 billion, beating the Wall Street consensus estimate of $4.53 billion. Revenue rose 59% in local-currency terms, the best gain since Alibaba's September 2014 IPO. EPS rose 33% to 74 cents, beating the consensus of 63 cents.JD.com reported revenue of $9.8 billion, slightly above the consensus and up 42% in local currency. It reported earnings per share of 4 cents, double the 2 cent consensus, but its Q3 revenue estimate fell short of projections. Both companies showed strong growth in mobile users.Alibaba stock soared 16% for the week, breaking out of a base to their highest level since January 2015. JD.com leapt nearly 13%.Next week, messaging giant Tencent (TCEHY), perhaps Alibaba's biggest Chinese rival, reports earnings. So do mobile gaming portal NetEase (NTES) and flash e-commerce seller Vipshop (VIPS).IBD'S TAKE: With the market at record highs, many growth names large and small are breaking out. To get an in-depth look at Alibaba, Acacia and other top-rated stocks -- and how they fare vs. rivals -- go to IBD Stock Checkup to develop your watch list.Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih hinted at a production freeze, which could come at a meeting on the sidelines of the International Energy Forum next month. But Russia's energy minister said he didn't see a reason for renewing talks. The International Energy Agency said the oil glut has disappeared, but it warned of weaker demand on a ""dimmer macroeconomic outlook"" in 2017. OPEC said Saudi Arabia pumped a record amount of crude oil in July, and the cartel left its 2017 demand outlook unchanged at 95.41 million barrels per day. The Energy Information Administration said that U.S. stockpiles rose by 1.1 million barrels to 523.6 million for the week ended Aug 5. And U.S. production fell by 0.2% to 8.44 million barrels, a second straight week of declines.U.S. oil rigs in operation rose by 15 to 396 in the week ended Aug. 12, Baker Hughes said. That's the seventh straight weekly gain and the highest level since late February.Still, U.S. crude oil prices closed the week at $44.49 a barrel, up 4.4%.Wal-Mart Stores, looking to keep pace with Amazon, agreed to buy Jet.com for $3.3 billion. Wal-Mart has sizable online sales, but growth has been decelerating. Wal-Mart also will put Jet.com CEO Marc Lore in charge of all of Wal-Mart's e-commerce operations, though Jet.com will remain separately. Lore previously founded Quidsi, parent of Diapers.com, before Amazon bought it.Wal-Mart stock rose 0.2%, hitting a 14-month high during the week.Solar stocks after SunPower cut its 2016 guidance and inverter-supplier SolarEdge (SEDG) cited a slowdown at U.S. installers. For Q2, SunPower's Q2 revenue growth and adjusted loss topped estimates. But SunPower sees Q3 revenue of just $700 million to $800 million vs. the consensus for $1.13 billion, as demand for utility-scale solar projects tumbles. And SunPower also cut its 2016 view to $2.8 billion-$3 billion, missing analysts' view for $3.3 billion.SolarEdge's $124.8 million in fiscal Q4 sales missed analysts' expectations for $129.4 million, but 44 cents EPS minus items beat by a nickel. The midpoint of current-quarter sales guidance for $130 million-$139 million trailed the consensus at $137 million, and EPS missed by a penny.SolarCity (SCTY), which has agreed to a takeover deal by Tesla (TSLA), topped analysts' Q2 projections for adjusted loss and revenue. But its current-quarter view for $155 million-$168 million in revenue lagged the consensus for $174.6 million.SunPower stock crashed 28% to a 3-year low.Chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA), involved in everything from gaming to autonomous driving and AI, rose 8.3% for the week to a fresh high after the Tesla partner reported $1.43 billion in sales and 40 cents earnings per share. That topped the consensus for $1.35 billion and 37 cents, and was up 24% and 700%, respectively, vs. last year. Nvidia sees current-quarter sales at $1.68 billion, plus or minus 2%, beating analysts' model for $1.45 billion.With China, telecoms and data centers spending heavily for higher-speed connections, makers of fiber optic components are seeing huge demand.Hot IPO Acacia Communications said Q2 revenue rose 101% to $116 million, and adjusted earnings soared 305%. Lumentum (LITE) and Inphi (IPHI) also reported stronger-than-expected figures. NeoPhotonics (NPTN) sales growth fell short due to sluggish demand for older parts, but production of 100-gigabit gear is ramping up. IBD's 14-company Telecom-Fiber Optics industry group hit a 15-year high Thursday and ranks No. 10 out of 197 groups.Acacia rose 41% Friday and nearly 50% for the week, blasting to new highs. Lumentum rose more than 4% and Inphi 16%, also to new highs. NeoPhotonics climbed 2.6% to 14.01, clearing a 13.85 buy point on Friday.Related:IBD'S TAKE: Acacia Communications is among several tech leaders that have risen 20% past a buy point, putting them in profit-taking zone. But when you should you sell these top stocks? IBD's latest Tech Leaders column explains when to hold onto winning stocks, and how those rules apply to Acacia, Weibo and others right now.Recent IPO Twilio (TWLO), a communications software firm, reported a narrower than-expected non-GAAP loss. Q2 revenue jumped 70% to $64.5 million, vs. Wall Street estimates of $58.2 million, although sales from its top customer, Facebook (FB)-owned WhatsApp, fell 8% year over year. Twilio's full-year guidance edged consensus estimates.Twilio shares surged 28% for the week, hitting a new high.Medpace Holdings (MEDP) soared 20% to 27.79 in Thursday's debut after pricing at 23, the high end of its expected IPO range. Shares edged up 0.9% to 28.04 on Friday. Medpace provides outsourced clinical development services for drug and medical device companies.Specialty drugmakers ended what had been a strong Q2 season for the drug industry on a more ambiguous note. Allergan (AGN), freshly divested of its generics business, beat expectations slightly but trimmed its sales guidance. Shares fell 1.7% for the week. Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX) missed Q2 numbers but affirmed its guidance as it reorganized. It said its deal with Walgreens (WBA) was finally turning profitable and that it was willing to sell $8 billion worth of non-core assets. The stock soared 25% Tuesday, but pared weekly gains to 13.5% on a report that Valeant could face criminal charges of defrauding insurers.Medivation (MDVN) reported a ho-hum quarter, but profit will likely be flat until an expected market expansion for its drug Xtandi in Q4. Shares rose 4.4% to 66.02, a 14-month high and just barely in buy range from a 63.04 entry. Jazz Pharmaceuticals (JAZZ) missed EPS estimates and lowered guidance, partly due to a change in tax reporting and partly due to higher costs. Its stock dropped 9.3%. Mylan (MYL) beat its profit estimate slightly and affirmed its guidance, with its controversially high-priced EpiPen making up for light generic drug sales. Mylan closed the week unchanged.Walt Disney (DIS) topped Wall Street estimates late Tuesday and said it had bought a 33% stake in streaming company BAMTech. As it vies to remain competitive in digital, the media conglomerate plans to launch an ESPN-branded over-the-top service, but it will not include current ESPN content. Q3 EPS rose 12% to $1.62 on 9% revenue growth to $14.28 billion. Shares were up about 1% for the week, but failed to hold above their 50-day line.Southwest (LUV) cut its third-quarter unit revenue outlook and said it expected higher unit costs due to 2,000-plus flight cancellations in July after a single router failure blacked out much of its technological infrastructure. The guidance came as Delta Air Lines (DAL) spent much of the week trying to recover from some 2,000 of its own flight cancellations caused by an outage early Monday. American Airlines (AAL), meanwhile, forecast an improvement in its Q3 unit revenue.Southwest and Delta shares fell 3.5% while American Air climbed 1.4%.Macy's (M) and Kohl's (KSS) reported lower sales, while Macy's also had declining earnings and said it would cut 100 stores. But they both topped forecasts after weeks of bad news from consumer stocks such as Ford (F) and McDonald's (MCD). So Macy's and Kohl's skyrocketed 16.7% and 14.3%, respectively for the week. Nordstrom (JWN) and JCPenney (JCP) topped on earnings and missed on revenue, with their shares also soaring for the week. But overall, retail sales were flat in July -- and down 0.3% excluding autos -- according to the Commerce Department. Home Depot (HD), Lowe's (LOW), Wal-Mart and Ross Stores (ROST) are among the retailers reporting this coming week.The IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index rose to a 14-month high in August, climbing 2.9 points to 48.4. That's still below the neutral 50 level.

139,ROST,"Burlington Stores (BURL) shares are rocketing to a new high Monday after the off-price retailer ramped-up second-quarter comp and earnings guidance. Other hot off-pricers -- namely, TJX (TJX) and Ross Stores (ROST) -- also got a nice lift.New Jersey-based Burlington now sees 28-30 cents in Q2 earnings per share and 4.2%-4.5% in same-store sales growth, up from prior outlook for 20-23 cents EPS and 2.5%-3.5% comps.The stock leapt 8.5% to close at 73.58 on the stock market today, remaining well above its 50-day line after shares found support at the key level in late May. Burlington has been trading above its 200-day line since mid-February.Meanwhile, TJX shares broke out, rising 1.9% to 79.26, which is also the 79.26 entry point from a flat base. TJX hit 79.47 intraday, an all-time high. The stock has been building a flat base since the start of April, with shares occasionally dipping below their 50-day moving average.IBD's TAKE: Burlington Stores is one of the top stocks in the Retail-Apparel/Shoes/Accessories group. But are its fundamentals off-price or at a premium? Find out at IBD Stock Checkup.And shares of Ross closed up 1.3% to 58.95. The stock, which cleared a 55.74 buy point earlier this month, is close to its all-time high of 59.68 on March 18.The off-price sector is one of the few hot spots in retail. NPD Group said last week that off-price customers now represent two-thirds of all consumers and make up three-quarters of clothing purchases across all retail channels.""Off-price is second only to the online channel in terms of growth rate,"" said NPD Chief Industry Analyst Marshal Cohen in a Thursday press release.Meanwhile, specialty discounters Five Below (FIVE) and Ollie's Bargain Outlet (OLLI).Five Below, which caters to teens, shot up 5.4% to 49.90, hitting its best levels since the end of 2013.Ollie's Bargain Outlet, a close-out and excess inventory retailer, rose 3.8% to 25.70. The stock is moving off its 50-day line after finding support there in recent days. Ollie's is in a double-bottom base with a buy point of 26.65.

140,ROST,"It's important to know the cup-without-handle base and cup-with-handle base, two classic stock chart patterns.Chartists also need to make sure they're familiar with a related structure, which IBD has dubbed the saucer base.As you might guess, the saucer is a shallower pattern than the cup. You might see a correction of about 12% to 20%, while a typical cup can run as deep as 35%. However, longer saucers may show a deeper decline that runs into the 25%-35% range too.See Full Series On Smart Chart ReadingSometimes a stock will tack on a handle to its saucer base. Other times it's in a hurry, and the stock breaks out to new highs without sketching a handle.What about length? A proper saucer takes at least seven weeks to develop. You also could have saucers that are a year long or more.For a good example of a saucer base, check out Ross Stores' (ROST) action in 2010.The Pleasanton, Calif.-based discount clothing and home goods retailer began to etch the saucer in mid-June 2010, as it slid toward its 10-week line (1). You could also view the saucer as starting in late April, and that would give roughly the same left-side high for the pattern.Ross established a bottom for this saucer in August 2010, and then it proceeded to build the base's right side. The pattern featured a correction of 16% -- or 17%, if you viewed the pattern as starting in late April.Ross appeared to add a handle to its saucer in late September and early October (2). However, volume wasn't strong as the stock moved past that handle pattern. A better interpretation is just to view Ross' consolidation as a simple saucer.In mid-to-late October, the stock edged past a 56.72 handle buy point and out of that saucer (the weekly chart reflects a 2-for-1 split in December 2011). In the Nov. 1 IBD, Ross held an 88 Composite Rating, a 97 EPS, 74 Relative Price Strength Rating and an A grade for SMR.Then in the week ended Nov. 5, big volume kicked in, and Ross really charged ahead (3). Sometimes volume can kick in a bit late with a breakout, but the move still works out.Note this breakout occurred not long after the Sept. 1, 2010, follow-through day that signaled a fresh market uptrend. That means if you bought the stock, you benefited from a positive general environment.Ross rose 144%, building new bases along the way, until it peaked at 70.82 in August 2012.(Editor's Note: This story originally published in the Jan. 24, 2013, edition of IBD.)

159,ROST,"The economy added 164,000 jobs in April as the jobless rate fell to 3.9%, the lowest since 2000. Yet wage growth, the key number for stock market investors on edge about more Fed rate hikes, surprised on the downside, coming in at 2.6%.The jobs and wage data slightly lowered odds of four Fed interest-rate hikes in 2018, which should be positive for the stock market. The data didn't initially provide much of a boost. The Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite opened moderately lower after the jobs data, but the major market indexes staged a midmorning rally, fueled by Apple (AAPL). The Nasdaq led the way into positive territory, soon followed by the Dow Jones and S&P 500.Wall Street expected 191,000 new jobs, 4.0% unemployment and a 2.7% annual rise in average hourly wages. Yet the undershooting on two of three key jobs metrics may make the job market look less robust than it is.First, job gains in the prior two months were revised up by a combined 30,000, leaving the 3-month average at a rock-solid 208,000.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseFurther, Jefferies economist Thomas Simons noted that wage growth is sometimes depressed in months that the Labor Department's survey of businesses doesn't include the 15th of the month, which occurred in April. If that's the case, wage growth could take a leap in May. However, March's wage gain was also revised down, from 2.7% to 2.6%.Jim Baird, chief investment officer for Plante Moran Financial Advisors, noted that other gauges of wage growth have pointed to stronger gains. The Employment Cost Index released last week showed that private-sector wages and salaries grew 2.9% from a year ago in March.After the jobs data, the 10-year Treasury yield eased to 2.935% while the 2-year yield, which more closely tracks Fed rate expectations, held around 2.49%. The narrow spread between long-term and short-term interest rates may reflect concerns that the Fed will hike rates too much in the near term as the economy gets a boost from tax-cut and spending stimulus, leading to an economic letdown.The stakes have increased for each jobs report as inflation has picked up close to the Fed's target 2% and interest rates have hit multiyear highs. The combination of low and falling unemployment with accelerating wage gains would fit perfectly with the Phillips curve theory that has long guided Federal Reserve policy. For investors, the key point is that most Fed policymakers still seem confident that inflation pressures won't lag too far behind wage pressures, as businesses pass along a portion of their higher wage bills.To some extent, it's already happening as the Fed's favored gauge of core inflation hit 1.9% in March. Meanwhile, Wall Street has bumped up odds for a fourth rate hike this year to about 40%. Still, the Fed signaled on Wednesday that it won't be overly concerned if inflation rises a bit above 2% for a few months.There's good reason to expect a further pickup in wage growth in coming months. A host of large companies including CVS Health (CVS), Starbucks (SBUX) and Target (TGT) have announced wage hikes rolling out this spring that may start to show up in Friday's report.This year is beginning to look lot like 2016, when wage gains accelerated into summer after Walmart (WMT) hiked its base wage to $10 an hour. Then Target, Costco (COST) and others followed. Walmart's minimum wage hike to $11 an hour has contributed to the same kind of dynamic early this year. Target subsequently hiked its base pay to $12 an hour and CVS to $11 an hour.And as those companies hike wages, their competitors are being pressured to do the same. In March, Kroger (KR), Dollar Tree (DLTR) and Ross Stores (ROST) all said they're raising wages for employees, and their stocks sold off amid worries about profit margins.What's different from 2016 is that now the jobless rate is nearly a percentage point lower, meaning more competition for workers. On top of that, numerous companies announced wage hikes in the wake of tax reform.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:No Fed Rate Hike, But Here's Why The Dow Jones Can't Get A Head Of SteamIf You Like Apple, You'll Love These 6 Market-Beating Stock PlaysThe 'Apple Of Oil' Near Buy Point Ahead Of Earnings After The CloseAmazon, These 5 IBD 50 Stocks Share This Winning Growth TraitHere's Why Anyone Can Time The Stock Market BottomLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

160,ROST,"Wage growth will likely accelerate in the March jobs report and beyond, with hawkish implications for the Fed interest-rate outlook. Goldilocks is on her way out.Wall Street economists expect the monthly employment report out at 8:30 a.m. ET to show a gain of 175,000 jobs. The unemployment rate should dip to 4%, the lowest since December 2000. Average hourly wage growth should tick up to 2.7% on an annual basis from a so-so 2.6% in February.Expect the improvement in wage growth to be the start of a trend for two reasons.First, dozens of major employers announced wage hikes over the past few months, but few came early enough to show up in February's jobs report. Walmart (WMT) and CVS Health (CVS) hiked their minimum wages to $11 an hour. Six months after raising its minimum wage to $11, Target (TGT) said last month that it will pay all current associates at least $12 an hour starting this spring.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseSecond, wage growth receded in the spring of 2017, rising just 2.2% at an annual rate from March through June. As those months that saw depressed pay gains drop off, replaced by months with firmer growth this year, the annual rate will trend higher.Take a closer look at Walmart's wage changes. Before its pay hike announced in January 2018, Walmart hadn't raised its base wage in nearly three years. That's a big deal. When Walmart hiked its minimum wage for all current associates to $10 an hour in February 2016, that wage hike was contagious.Walmart is big enough to put upward pressure on wages for other employers. Target and Costco (COST) were among those who quickly hiked pay shortly after that 2016 move. Average hourly earnings growth rose to 2.8% that July before momentum flagged.Walmart's 2016 wage hike came when the jobless rate was nearly 5%. Now it's around 4%, so competition for workers has intensified. At least for workers on the lower end of the wage spectrum, pay hikes appear to be broad-based. Starbucks (SBUX), Kroger (KR), Dollar Tree (DLTR) and Ross Stores (ROST) all have said they're raising pay. Meanwhile, dozens of banks, including Bank of America (BAC) and Wells Fargo (WFC) hiked their minimum wage to $15 an hour for tellers.As wage gains accelerate and the jobless rate moves below 4% in coming months, Fed policymakers may lean toward four interest-rate hikes in 2018, not just three. Fed models assume that inflation will follow wage growth higher. There's reason to be skeptical. For example, Kroger said last month that it will use the bulk of its tax cut to offset the cost of higher wages and lower prices.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN: Check Out These 4 Dow Jones Stocks; One Is Near A Buy PointBoeing, GE, United Tech Fall As China Hits Aviation But 737 Orders Roll InHow To Invest In A Late-Stage Bull Market As FANG Stocks SlumpStocks To Watch: These Stocks Just Got Added To IBD 50, IPO LeadersTop Stock LGI Homes Breaks Out To Buy Zone On Strong Growth

161,ROST,"Don't be fooled by the weak job growth or higher-than-expected unemployment in March. Better wage growth and less labor-market slack mean the stock market won't get much of a reprieve from Fed rate-hike fears.The good news: The surprisingly weak 103,000 job gain throws a bit of cold water on the notion that the economy is overheating. Yet a hawkish shift by the data-dependent Federal Reserve will continue to remain a risk for investors with every wage and inflation report. The consumer price index coming out on Wednesday is the next one to watch. UniCredit Research expects the core CPI, excluding food and energy, to rise 2% from a year ago vs. 1.8% in February.Following the report, Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite initially moved higher, then relapsed in late morning trade on the stock market today. The Dow Jones, S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite were all down 1% or more.Before the report, stock market futures were deep in the red in reaction to President Trump's threat to strike back at China even harder, with tariffs on an additional $100 billion in imports.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe 10-year Treasury yield slipped about 5 basis points to 2.78% as stocks fell and the jobs and unemployment data surprised on the soft side. Odds of four Federal Reserve rate hikes this year, one more than expected, eased to about 26% after the report, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool.Average hourly wages rose 8 cents to $26.82 an hour, lifting the annual gain to 2.7%, in line with expectations.Wall Street economists expected a 175,000 job gain, 4.0% unemployment and 2.7% average wage growth.Still, job growth has averaged a solid 202,000 the past three months, including revisions. A balmy February likely shifted some seasonal job employment forward, depressing March job creation.Harm Bandholz, chief U.S. economist at UniCredit, pointed out that jobless rate actually did decline in March — if you don't round to the tenths — from 4.14% to 4.07%. Over the past 12 months, the labor force has increased by 125,000 per month, on average, well below the pace of job creation. ""Looking forward, we continue to expect the jobless rate to fall towards 3.5% by the end of the year.""Employers also have been increasing work hours, further evidence of less slack. On a weekly basis, the average wage rose 3.3% from a year ago in March, the best gain in seven years.Investors should expect the improvement in hourly wage growth to be the start of a trend for two reasons.First, dozens of major employers announced wage hikes over the past few months, but few came early enough to show up in February's jobs report. Walmart (WMT) and CVS Health (CVS) hiked their minimum wages to $11 an hour.

162,ROST,"The favored Fed inflation gauge, the core personal consumption expenditures price index, rose 0.2% on the month and 1.6% from a year ago in February, the Commerce Department reported Thursday.Core inflation came in a tad hotter than the 1.5% annual rate expected. Including food and energy prices, the PCE price index rose 0.2% on the month and 1.8% from a year ago vs. expectations of 0.2% and 1.7% increases.After the report, Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 index futures rose a little more, while the 10-year Treasury yield was little changed around 2.77%.If the inflation data stay tame, and core PCE inflation remains well below the Fed's 2% inflation target, the U.S. central bank probably won't hike its key interest rate four times this year. At last week's Fed meeting, policymakers' projections saw core inflation rising to 1.9% this year as the Fed hikes three times.Policymakers are getting more confident that inflation will start to firm. Their projections point to 2.1% core inflation in 2019, just above their target.The Fed still believes in the Phillips curve, which predicts rising wage growth as unemployment falls. Before too long, wage pressures put upward pressure on consumer prices.So far, official measures haven't detected a pickup in wages. The Labor Department reported weaker-than-expected 2.6% annual average hourly wage inflation in February. But faster wage growth should begin to show up this spring, reflecting recently announced wage hikes from Walmart (WMT), Target (TGT), CVS Health (CVS) and Starbucks (SBUX) that didn't happen soon enough for the latest jobs report.As those companies hike wages, their competitors are being pressured to do the same. Earlier this month, Kroger (KR), Dollar Tree (DLTR) and Ross Stores (ROST) all said they're raising wages for employees, and their stocks sold off amid worries about profit margins.The competitive environment facing Kroger from Walmart and Amazon (AMZN) via its Whole Foods division, among others, offers at least some reason to doubt whether wage pressure will feed through to higher prices. Kroger said on Thursday that it will use one-third of its tax cut to boost shareholder returns, but the other two-thirds will go to higher wages and lower prices.Still, inflation is likely to remain near the top of investors' concerns this year. Fed policymakers expect to hike rates another three times in 2019 and two more in 2020, which is far more than financial markets think can or should happen.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Inflation And The Fed Rate-Hike Outlook: What You Need To KnowStock Market Today: Track Market Trends And The Best Stocks To WatchWill Techs Drive Stock Market Into Bear Territory?

168,ROST,"Gap (GPS) and Ross Stores (ROST) both topped first-quarter forecasts after the close Thursday, joining Wal-Mart (WMT) in providing some relief to the beleaguered retail sector.Estimates: Earnings per share are expected to fall 9% to 29 cents, with revenue dipping 1% to $3.39 billion.Results: EPS of 36 cents on revenue of $3.44 billion. Same-store sales rose 2%, and were up 8% at Old Navy, down 4% at Gap and down 4% at Banana Republic.Outlook: First-half EPS is now seen down by mid-single digits, better than its prior forecast for a drop in the high-single digits. Full-year sales are seen ""slightly below"" a range of ""flat to up slightly"" vs. consensus views for a 0.4% uptick.""We've made substantial improvements in product quality and fit, and our increasing responsive capabilities are enabling us to better react to trends and demand,"" said CEO Art Peck in a statement.Stock: Gap rallied 3.5% late. Shares closed down 1.6% at 23.19 on the stock market today and have plunged 13% from a week ago.Estimates: A 10% bump in EPS to 80 cents, as revenue rises 6% to $3.27 billion.Results: EPS of 82 cents on revenue of $3.3 billion. Same-store sales rose 3%.Outlook: Q2 EPS of 73-76 cents, below views for 78 cents, as comp sales rise 1%-2%. Full-year EPS is now seen at $3.07-$3.17, with the midpoint below views for $3.15.""We achieved respectable growth in both sales and earnings during the first quarter despite the uncertainty and volatility in the external environment,"" said CEO Barbara Rentler in a statement. ""Operating margin of 15.2% exceeded our expectations due to above-plan sales and merchandise margin.""Stock: Ross rose 3.7% late. Shares finished 0.7% lower at 61.07, and rival TJX (TJX) ticked down 0.4% to 74.48.Retailers like the Gap have suffered as consumers opt to make purchases online and at discount retailers like Ross and TJX, whose Q1 sales and profit forecasts reported this week nonetheless weren't up to Street expectations.Macy's stock crashed last week on disappointing results, and Sears Holdings' (SHLD) CEO said some of its suppliers are trying to exploit the doom-hype surrounding the company to work out better deals for themselves. There are still some bright spots in retail, with Wal-Mart, L Brands (LB) and Children's Place (PLCE) rallying on strong results.For the discounters, physical space has maintained its appeal in part due to what the industry calls the in-store ""treasure hunt"" — that is, when customers walk in looking for a bargain and find a deal they didn't expect.And TJX on Tuesday said it is looking to home goods, which CEO Ernie Herrman said are less vulnerable to weather fluctuations. Home goods have been ""a driver"" for the company, he said, as they have for other retailers.Off-price chain Burlington Stores (BURL), for instance, has reduced its dependency on coats for its sales in part by sprucing up its home and beauty product lines.RELATED:Home Depot Is One Retailer That Isn't Falling Apart: Earnings StrongWal-Mart Targets Amazon, Pulls Away From Rivals Online; Stock At 2-Year HighTarget's Big Q1 Beat Offers Some Hope, But There's Still This Scary ThingMacy's Doesn't Know How To Fix Its Stores, Hopes Something Will Work

170,ROST,"TJX (TJX), the parent of T.J. Maxx, Marshalls and HomeGoods, disappointed investors with a first-quarter revenue and profit guidance miss early Tuesday, but shares started creeping back up during the call as management announced plans to introduce a new home-decor concept, Homesense, to American shoppers and expressed bullishness in the face of broader retail combustion.""Home is a driver for TJX,"" said CEO Ernie Herrman in response to an analyst query, adding that the company's home businesses have been ""a little stronger than apparel."" He also alluded to home goods being less susceptible to the impact of poor weather, which weighed on comparable sales during the quarter.""We think nobody can replicate the fashion and the quality level we have at our home businesses,"" he said on the call. ""We think strategically this is not a short-term vision.""Herrman was fairly mum about the details, but said that there would be an ""extremely visible difference"" between Homesense and its American sister, HomeGoods, that would propel customers to shop at both stores.While Homesense shares the same name as TJX's home-goods stores in Canada and Europe, spokespeople told Investor's Business Daily that the U.S. Homesense would be different.In Canada, the self-described ""home fashions off-price"" store can be found as stand-alone locations or as superstores, in which a HomeSense is teamed up with a Winners or Marshalls store, according to the HomeSense site. There are currently 106 stores across 10 Canadian provinces.The U.S. concept is slated to debut toward the end of the summer, said Herrman.While TJX's Marshalls and T.J. Maxx locations in the U.S. logged flat comparable sales, HomeGoods comps grew 3% during the April-ended quarter, better than FactSet views for 2.4% growth.Aware of the broader troubles of the retail sector, management brushed off the threat of e-commerce and Amazon (AMZN). People are still shopping for clothes at TJX-owned stores, was the message.Herrman said Q2 is ""off to a solid start,"" with inventory in a good position, and later added that the company is ""still gaining apparel market share in the U.S.""Shares of TJX tumbled 4.1% to 73.76 on the stock market today after falling to a six-month low of 73.17 earlier. On May 10, TJX tried to break out of a consolidation resistance area. But shares have sold off since then in the wake of grim news from other retailers. Off-price rival Ross Stores (ROST), which reports earnings on Thursday, was down 1.4%.In Q1, TJX's profit rose 8% to 82 cents on 3% revenue growth to $7.78 billion, vs. consensus for 79 cents a share and $7.88 billion in sales. Same-store sales rose 1%, below some estimates.Management sees Q2 EPS of 81-83 cents vs. 84 cents a year earlier. Analysts had expected 92 cents. TJX sees full-year profit of $3.71-$3.78, up 5%-7%, also below views. The company said currency effects and wage increases weighed on its guidance.Off-pricers like TJX and Ross enjoyed a reputation for being untouchable by Amazon, thanks to the in-store treasure-hunt nature of bargain-rack shopping. But Tuesday's weak sales and guidance raised concerns that status may be under threat as the rest of retail suffers a face-melting sell-off.Macy's (M), Kohl's (KSS), J.C. Penney (JCP), Nordstrom (JWN) and Dillard's (DDS) plunged last week amid grim results and a growing fear that department stores don't know how to stop the bleeding. Macy's and Dillard's have hit their lowest levels in more than five years, while J.C. Penney is at record lows.And Sears Holdings' (SHLD) CEO has resorted to blasting vendors in a blog post, in a bid to un-smear the long-ailing retailer's name in the press. That's sent Sears shares tumbling 12.3% on Monday.RELATED:Home Depot Is One Retailer That Isn't Falling Apart: Earnings StrongMacy's Doesn't Know How To Fix Its Stores, Hopes Something Will WorkHere's One More Thing Amazon May Be KillingWhat To Expect From Target, Wal-Mart In The Wake Of Mall Meltdown

Revenue rose to $5.61 billion.Outlook: Dollar General reaffirmed its EPS estimates and raised its full-year sales growth target to 5%-7%, with the midpoint above the consensus of 5.5%, up from a prior view of 4%-6%. It now sees 1,290 new stores this fiscal year, up from a prior view of 1,000, after getting regulatory approval in April to acquire a ""small-box"" retailer. Management also expects to relocate or remodel 750 stores this year, down from an earlier view of 900.""Our same-store sales improved as we moved past the delay in income tax refunds and the timing shift of the later Easter holiday,"" said CEO Todd Vasos in a statement. ""We continue to execute on our focused strategy and implement our operating initiatives which we believe will improve customer traffic and transactions.""Stock: Shares rose 6.5% to 78.19 in the stock market today, gapping above the 200-day line.Rival Dollar Tree (DLTR) climbed 3.7%, rising above its 50-day and 200-day averages. Dollar Tree is working its way through a long consolidation. Last week, Dollar Tree gave weak Q2 and full-year guidance after missing Q1 earnings views and meeting sales estimates.Estimates: Earnings per share of 14 cents, a 17% jump, with revenue of $231 million, climbing 20%.Results: EPS was 15 cents, up 25% as revenue rose 21% to $232.9 million. Same-store sales climbed 2.6%.Outlook: Five Below sees Q2 EPS of 24-27 cents vs. estimates of 22 cents, with revenue of $273 million to $280 million vs. estimates of $265 million. Five Below raised its full-year guidance. It sees EPS of $1.59-$1.64 vs. views of $1.62. It expects revenue of $1.227 billion to $1.242 billion from its March estimate $1.21 billion to $1.23 billion. It now sees full-year same-store sales up 3%-4%.Stock: Shares rose 2.8% to 53.40 in late trading after spiking more than 6% initially. The stock closed up 1.2% to 51.91. Five Below had been trying to break out of a long cup-with-handle base with a 52.73 buy point but has been pulling back in the last few sessions.Once seen as more resistant to the Amazon (AMZN) effect that has been ravaging most retailers, discounters have run into problems of late. One key factor is Wal-Mart (WMT) putting renewed pressure on prices.Late Wednesday, Ollie's Bargain Outlet (OLLI) beat Q1 forecasts but gave mixed guidance. Ollie's Bargain shares shot up 6.1% to 43.65 Thursday to a new high.Two weeks ago, off-price chain Ross Stores (ROST) was also cautious with its forecast after topping Q1 views, joining TJX (TJX) with weak estimates.

E-commerce sales growth is now expected to be in the 50% range vs. 40%.Stock: Shares jumped in late trade, up as much 6% and well over the 300 mark after the closing bell. Shares rose 4.5% to 293.04 on the stock market today, retaking their 289.37 buy point earlier, after Wednesday's dive sent shares below their 50-day moving average.IBD'S TAKE: Ulta Beauty logged same-store sales growth of 16.6%, 16.7%, 14.4% and 15.2% in the most recent four quarters. There are reasons why Ulta and other specialty beauty retailers haven't succumbed to the ""Amazon effect,"" say experts.The retail sector looks cringe-worthy and investors are looking for bright spots. Those have typically come in the form of off-price chains like TJX (TJX), Ross Stores (ROST) and Burlington Stores (BURL) (the latter of which is popping Thursday on results), and beauty specialists like LVMH (LVMUY)-owned Sephora and Ulta Beauty.Meanwhile, Amazon.com (AMZN)-related worries and poor same-store sales growth at department stores are wreaking their usual havoc on the sector this quarter.RELATED:Why Ulta Beauty Shares Fell Out Of Buy Range Ahead Of EarningsAnother Wild Ride From Ulta Beauty After Earnings?

On Thursday, Facebook had its fifth anniversary. Facebook went public at 38 a share on May 18, 2012. Shares popped to 45 moments after trading began, but closed near the IPO price. Then it spent more than a year below 38. Finally, it broke out in powerful fashion in July 2013. From that 32.61 buy point, Facebook has soared 354% to Thursday's close of 147.94.IBD'S TAKE: Facebook is a standout company and stock. But it's only ranked sixth in IBD's Internet-Content group. To see which stocks are the group's top performers and how they stack up vs. Facebook and objective criteria, check out IBD's Stock Checkup.It seems obvious in hindsight that Facebook would thrive, even when its stock was underwater for 14 months. But it wasn't. Yahoo (YHOO) fell behind to Google in search, and Google couldn't catch up in social media with its ill-fated Google+. Facebook, like many other internet firms, had to deal with a massive shift to mobile, where ads paid out less. That meant Facebook had to spend more to make less.However, Facebook executed brilliantly. As mobile became its dominant form, additional users and ads translated into massive revenue and earnings growth yet again. Its Instagram purchase — a month before its IPO — turned out to be a boon, especially in battling upstart Snapchat, the main unit of recent IPO Snap (SNAP).On its anniversary, Facebook kept busy. Facebook reached a deal Thursday to live-stream 20 Major League Baseball games. It'll stream a game every Friday for the rest of the season, starting on May 19 with the Colorado Rockies vs. the Cincinnati Reds. Facebook already has a pact with Univision to stream some MLS soccer games.Facebook and other streaming sites are making a big push to cover sports. Amazon recently forged a deal to air the NFL's 10 ""Thursday Night Football"" games next season. Amazon is replacing Twitter, which had those rights in the most recent season.Facebook rebounded from its 50-day moving average on Thursday in above-average volume, though trading cooled from Wednesday. It was solid action at a key support level. But with the current market uptrend under pressure, investors should be cautious about stepping in.RELATED:The Big Picture: 3 Technical Signs That Favor The BullsSalesforce.com Beats Profit, Revenue Views, Tweaks Full-Year OutlookApplied Materials Hails 'Tremendous Momentum'; EPS Growth Tops 100% Again

175,ROST,"X President Trump's political woes sent the S&P 500 index, Dow Jones industrial average and Nasdaq composite tumbling, but not for long. But Alibaba (BABA) and other China internet stocks rallied on generally upbeat reports. Dow retailers Wal-Mart (WMT) and Home Depot (HD) had strong results, but many other retailers are struggling. Dow tech giant Cisco Systems (CSCO) sold off on its weak guidance.An ongoing stream of damaging media reports took their toll on President Trump, raising concerns that he'll be too distracted or too weak to push tax cuts through this year, if at all. The Dow industrials and S&P 500 fell 1.8% on Wednesday. The Nasdaq composite tumbled 2.6%. But stocks slashed losses on Thursday and Friday, with the Dow and S&P 500 off 0.4% and the Nasdaq 0.6%. Credit Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN) and the other FANG+ stocks, along with Alibaba (BABA) and other Chinese internets.Alibaba's Q1 EPS rose 37% to 63 cents, but missed the consensus by 3 cents as tax expenses and spending on its entertainment and cloud computing businesses ramped up. Revenue jumped 60% to $5.61 billion, beating views. The Chinese e-commerce giant also OK'd a $6 billion buyback. Shares rose 0.5% Thursday after falling 5% early, then rose to a record high on Friday. On Wednesday, archrival Tencent (TCEHY) reported EPS surged 57% in local currency to 22 cents, beating by a penny, as revenue popped 55% $7.18 billion. Tencent stock hit new highs.On Tuesday, internet portal Sina (SINA) and its majority-owned social messaging site Weibo (WB) reported stronger than expected earnings. Weibo reported daily active users of 154 million, up 28% vs the year earlier. Weibo shares soared 25%, Sina 22%.Specialty online retailer Vipshop (VIPS) reported in-line earnings, better-than-expected revenue and solid guidance, but shares tumbled 10.3%.Baozun (BZUN), an Alibaba-backed provider of e-commerce services for brand partners, reported EPS that just met views. Shares dived 12% on Wednesday, but were up 8.6% for the week.Target (TGT) earnings fell 6% while sales dipped 1% to $16.02 billion, but those were not as bad as feared. Comps skidded 1.3% but better than the expected 3.7% tumble. Shares rose Wednesday but finished the week up just 0.4%, still close to five-year lows. Meanwhile, Wal-Mart Q1 profit unexpectedly ticked up 2% to $1 a share, surprising Street estimates for a 2% dip, though 1.4% sales growth to $117.54 billion just missed. Still, U.S. same-store sales rose, unlike Target and many other retailers. The megastore credited organic growth at Walmart.com for its 63% boost in U.S. online sales, although it also acquired two e-commerce properties, Moosejaw and ModCloth, during the quarter. Wal-Mart shares rose 4.1% to a two-year best.Cisco Systems (CSCO) adjusted fiscal third-quarter earnings rose 5% to 60 cents, beating views by 2 cents. Revenue fell 1% to $11.94 billion, above estimates but the sixth straight year-over-year decline as the networking giant transitions from sluggish switch and router hardware to software and security. Current-quarter revenue guidance was far short of forecasts, in part because of concerns that President Trump's economic and tax agenda has stalled.Cisco shares fell 6.7% for the week.Home Depot (HD) reported first-quarter earnings that beat estimates, making it one of the few retailers that isn't cracking under the weight of e-commerce, discounts, discounters, too many stores and not enough traffic. The home-improvement chain hiked its full-year EPS forecast, which was still below expectations. Home Depot shares hit a record high Tuesday but dipped 0.4% for the week. Rival Lowe's (LOW), which reports next week, lost 0.3%, but in buy range.The semiconductor equipment manufacturer's second-quarter profit rose 132% while sales climbed 45% to $3.55 billion, both better than expected. It was the third straight quarter of triple-digit earnings growth for Applied Materials (AMAT). For the current quarter, Applied gave EPS and sales targets above the consensus. Applied Materials jumped early Friday, but closed up just 0.4%.RELATED:Applied Materials Hails 'Tremendous Momentum'; EPS Growth Tops 100% AgainSalesforce.com said fiscal Q1 adjusted earnings were 28 cents a share, up 17% vs. a year earlier, with revenue rising 25% to $2.39 billion.

Ross rose Friday, paring its week loss to 2%.Computer-aided design software firm Autodesk (ADSK) saw its stock surge 14.7% to record levels Friday after it beat Wall Street's targets for its fiscal first quarter ended April 30.

An unconfirmed report that the online giant is seeking to break into the drug-dispensing business weighed on Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA), CVS Health (CVS) midweek. But it may not be smooth sailing for the online giant in this competitive space, Mizuho Securities analyst Ann Hynes wrote that the established players have access to discounted drugs that Amazon is unlikely to beat and already offer drug delivery by mail. Plus, the regulatory and infrastructure hurdles to building out a pharmacy business are high. Amazon is also said to be in talks with Dish Network (DISH) over a wireless partnership. Word of a deal is awaited.The race toward an autonomous driving future continues to heat up. On Tuesday, BMW Group, Intel (INTC) and Mobileye (MBLY) announced a partnership with Delphi Automotive (DLPH) to bring self-driving kits to multiple automakers.

177,ROST,"XStock futures reversed lower Thursday morning as Brazil's political and market turmoil adds to Trump-related selling following New York's worst day of 2017.The Justice Department late Wednesday named a special prosecutor to take over the Russia-Trump probe and Cisco Systems (CSCO) plunged on weak guidance. Meanwhile, fellow Dow component Wal-Mart (WMT) gets a chance this morning to show if it can hold its own against Amazon.com (AMZN).That comes after the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite suffered their worst losses in months, following reports that President Trump pressured then-FBI chief James Comey to drop his investigation of short-lived National Security Advisor Mike Flynn.Bank stocks were big losers, with Citigroup (C) falling 4% and Bank of America (BAC) 5.9%. Citigroup dropped below an aggressive buy point. Bank of America plunged through its 50-day line.The DOJ late Wednesday named ex-FBI Director Richard Mueller to take over the investigation of links between Russia and President Trump's associates in the 2016 campaign.At minimum, Trump's escalating political troubles suggest that the president will struggle to pass tax cuts or other pro-growth initiatives. Stocks had soared on hopes for that agenda but soured Wednesday.Meanwhile, Brazil stock futures tumbled overnight following new audio disclosures linking President Temer to a massive corruption scandal underway. Huge protests took place Wednesday night vs. Michel Temer, who was vice president until his predecessor, Dilma Rousseff, was impeached for her ties to the same broad scandal. The iShares MSCI Brazil Capped ETF (EWZ) plunged 15.6% in the premarket after falling 3.2% Tuesday.S&P 500 index futures fell 0.3% vs. fair value reversing from gains of roughly 0.4% overnight. Dow futures were down 0.4% vs. fair value. Nasdaq 100 futures sank more than 0.4%.Over in Asia, investors continued the worldwide selloff. Japan's Nikkei sank 1.3% and Australia's ASX/S&P 200 retreated 0.8% Thursday. The Shanghai composite retreated 0.45%. European markets were lower in intraday action, with the U.K.'s FTSE down 1.4%, Germany's Dax 0.9% and France's CAC-40 1%.After Wednesday's market close, networking giant Cisco Systems reported better-than-expected earnings while revenue edged past views, though it fell vs. a year earlier for a sixth straight quarter. But Cisco sees larger-than-expected EPS and sales declines in the current quarter. Shares crashed 7.5% in premarket trading. Cisco had fallen 1.4% to 33.82 on Wednesday, better than the general market and not far from a 34.63 buy point.Looking ahead, Wal-Mart will report first-quarter earnings early Thursday. Wal-Mart has spent heavily to step up its online game, buying Jet.com last year and adding some niche e-commerce firms in 2017. The retail giant even stole a march on Amazon, cutting its minimum online order for free shipping to $35 earlier this year. That spurred Amazon to reverse its policy and cut rates twice, from $50 to $35, and then to $25.Wal-Mart is expected to report a 2% EPS decline to 96 cents, according to Zacks Investment Research, with sales up 1.5% to $117.63 billion.

179,ROST,"The major indexes showed flattish action Tuesday as sellers pounded discount retail names (think the likes of TJX (TJX) and Ross Stores (ROST)) and buyers lifted the top names in the Chinese internet, e-commerce and social media space (think Sina (SINA), Momo (MOMO), Weibo (WB), JD.com (JD) and Alibaba (BABA)).At 1:30pm ET, the Dow Jones industrial average rose minimally while the Nasdaq composite added 0.2% and notched a new all-time high of 6163.The S&P 500 was virtually flat. However, both the Dow industrials and the 500 continue to ride on the north side of their 50-day lines, a good sign.On April 24, as seen in the Market Pulse table embedded within IBD's daily Big Picture column, the current outlook for equities got an upgrade from ""Uptrend under pressure"" to ""Uptrend resumes."" The uptrend was confirmed all the way back on June 30 of last year.Among industry groups, many of the worst performers in IBD's 197 group rankings came from the retail sector, including leisure goods, jewelry, apparel and shoes, and discount and variety.Volume is running slightly higher on both main exchanges vs. the same time Monday. Breadth is negative on both the NYSE and the Nasdaq, with declining stocks outweighing rising ones by a roughly 7-to-5 ratio.In the Chinese web space, Sina staged an impressive breakaway gap, rushing past an 85.34 buy point in an eight-month base, following sterling Q1 results (earnings of 50 cents a share vs. a 4-cent loss in the year-ago quarter, revenue up 49%). Shares jumped more than 18% to 99.61 in a whale of volume. The average turnover is 781,000 shares; at 12 p.m. New York time, more than 6 million shares had already exchanged hands.One could have also bought Sina ahead of the Q1 results when the stock popped up above an 80 early buy point, 10 cents above the Feb. 23 intraday high. From that day, Sina created a nice 10-week flat base with a 14.5% drop from head to toe.For now, Sina is extended well past the traditional buy point as well as the opening price near 89. One could see if it stages a light pullback in modest volume over the next few weeks and see if it gives investors a second chance to buy near Tuesday's opening price. Otherwise, wait for a new base to form, or a first and second test of the 10-week moving average. Check out a long weekly chart of Sina, and you'll see that the latest long base is likely a second-stage one after years of bottoming out in price, from 147 in 2011 to a low of 31.92 in early 2015. That's the classic sign of a bottoming base. A MarketSmith chart allows you to easily look at historical time frames.Alibaba, up nearly 2% to 123.69 and a new high, will report Q1 results after the close Thursday. Expect earnings to rise 40% to 66 cents a share, which would mark an acceleration from increases of 24%, 39% and 30% in the prior three quarters. Alibaba's Q1 growth could be getting some help from an easy year-over-year comp; in Q1 2016, profits actually declined 4% to 47 cents a share.Meanwhile, financial software firms are quietly making nice moves. Most of these are in the small-to-midcap range.The stock initially cleared a cup with handle at 104.67 in February. The initial breakout was slow, but Alibaba did not trigger any defense-type sell signals. The stock's breakout gain has now exceeded 17%. Alibaba has a float of 1.02 billion shares and a market value of $314 billion. SS&C Technologies (SSNC), Pegasystems (PEGA) and Jack Henry (JKHY) also show good relative strength and decent Composite Ratings, as seen in IBD Stock Checkup.SS&C, up more than 1% to 37.65 in heavy turnover, has gained more than 10% since clearing a six-month cup-type base with a 34.29 buy point on Feb. 16. In early April, the stock showed a fine test of support at the 50-day moving average, promoting a new entry point near 35.On April 27, the expert in management software for banks and money managers extended its streak of double-digit EPS and revenue growth to eight quarters.Q1 profit jumped 19% to 44 cents a share as revenue climbed 26% to $407.7 million. One would prefer to see EPS growth be stronger than revenue growth. Interestingly, SS&C's revenue has grown faster than the bottom line for seven quarters in a row.Also in the same financial software group, Guidewire Software (GWRE) is producing a new base and is edging past a 62.78 handle buy point on a long, saucerlike base. While the 68 Rating is just mediocre, that's typical for stocks that form bases stretching for nine months to a year or more.Back to the retail sector, TJX gapped down more than 3% to 74.11 in volume that is running more than four times usual levels. The operator of TJMaxx, Marshalls and Home Goods deep-discount stores reported an 8% increase in fiscal Q1 earnings to 82 cents a share, better than the 4%-to-5% gains seen in the prior three quarters.But TJX's revenue growth slowed to 3%, down from gains of 8%, 10%, 7%, 7% and 6% in the prior five quarters.TJX is now well below its 50- and 200-day moving averages. The big-cap play had broken out of a somewhat odd-looking double-bottom base at 79.26 in mid-July last year, but gained only 5.5% before turning tail.A true CAN SLIM leader will have the gusto to rally as much as 20% to 25% past a proper buy point in a good base (be it a cup with handle, double bottom, or flat base) before making a significant dive in price.RELATED:How To Sell At The Top: Do You Know How To Spot Market Distribution?This Chinese Social Media Play Has More Than Doubled In 2017; Where Is The Next Buy Point?How To Find Great Stocks: What Are The Elements Of A Super Cup Base?How To Use Charts I: What Is The Bottoming Base Pattern?How To Use Charts II: Why Do Flat Bases Work For Some Great Winners?How Are Retail Groups Faring?

180,ROST,"Amazon (AMZN) is frequently touted as one of the greatest threats to the traditional brick-and-mortar retail industry. But it is off-price stores, not the mega e-commerce giant, that is seen reaping a billion-dollar gain from department store closings this year, as Macy's shutters over 60 locations and JCPenney closes the doors on 138 stores.""Of the roughly $1.6 billion of sales freed up from the J.C. Penney's (JCP) and Macy's (M) store closures, we believe off-price retailers are in a position to capture up to $1 billion dollars of these sales over the next 12 months (based on locations within 30 miles of the named store closings),"" wrote Wedbush analyst Morry Brown in a Monday research note.The biggest off-price winner by same-store sales growth? Burlington Stores (BURL). The chain is positioned to gain the most comp action, since it has the most overlap with department store exits, said Brown. That is followed by T.J. Maxx and Marshalls parent TJX (TJX) and then by Ross Stores (ROST).But by dollar amount, TJX will likely come out the major gainer. Wedbush sees the closings presenting a $549 million opportunity for TJX, and a $207 million and $196 million opportunity for Ross Stores and Burlington, respectively.Consumers could easily take their shopping online if the nearest Macy's or JCPenney shutters. But there's a strong likelihood that they'll take their business to the nearest off-pricer — and Wedbush says its projections might be on the low end, even taking Amazon and online retailers into account.""While a scenario in which off-price siphons off roughly 50% of abandoned sales from the JCP/M door closings would appear to be a fair scenario, we note historical precedent suggests this analysis could prove conservative, even accounting for online market share gains,"" wrote Brown. ""Since 2007, department store sales losses and off-price sales gains have closely tracked each other, with off-price revenues more than overtaking department store share losses.""IBD'S TAKE: The rapidly changing retail landscape can be tough to track. For the latest in the space, bookmark IBD's retail and e-commerce sector news hub. What becomes of the full-price landscape down the road?""Presumably, much of the full price business eventually moves online, through some combination of: (1) Amazon, (2) smaller niche e-commerce retailers or (3) vendor's owned websites,"" said Brown.TJX, Ross Stores and Burlington Stores edged up 0.1%, 0.2% and 0.3%, respectively, on the stock market today. Macy's lost 1% while J.C. Penney gained 0.7%. Amazon climbed 1% to 907.35, beyond the 5% chase zone from a 860.96 entry.RELATED:Death Stalks Retail Stocks, But Hope Lives OnAs 'Amazon Effect' Barrels On, Here's How Big Box Retailers Are Faring OnlineWal-Mart's 4th E-Commerce Deal In 4 Months May Cost $300 Million

""Clearly the off-price channel continues to be among the chosen shopping destinations for consumers, and we believe TJX is well positioned to continue to gain share.""TJX profit and revenue for the period grew 10% each to 76 cents a share and $7.54 billion, respectively. Analysts had expected 71 cents a share on $7.28 billion in revenue.TJX recorded 7% same-store sales growth at outlets open more than a year.

Trump also vowed ""massive tax relief for the middle class.""Six Dow components, including General Electric (GE), Boeing (BA) and United Technologies (UTX) have backed a border-adjustment tax. Retailers and apparel firms, including Dow stocks Wal-Mart (WMT) and Nike (NKE) are strongly opposed, while Dow automaker General Motors CEO Mary Barra said Tuesday that a border tax would be ""problematic.""Trump also said he would push for $1 trillion in infrastructure spending, via public and private sources. That seems to measure up to his Monday pledge for ""big"" infrastructure boosts, but he didn't spell out the timing of any such initiative. With tax reform and ObamaCare among the other big issues facing his administration and Congress, a report last week said infrastructure may be pushed back to 2018.Steel, concrete, construction and other infrastructure firms were big winners after Trump's election, but they've swung up and down in recent weeks as investors try to figure out what will actually occur, and when.In Asian trading Wednesday, Japan's Nikkei index rose 1.4% as the yen on bets that the Fed will raise rates.China's Shanghai composite advanced 0.3%.

200,ROST,"Home Depot (HD) reports first-quarter earnings Tuesday morning, and archrival Lowe's (LOW) will announce Q1 financial results early Wednesday, after dismal results from top chains like Macy's (M), Nordstrom (JWN), Kohl's (KSS) and Gap (GPS) sparked deep sell-offs in most retail and consumer stocks last week.But top home improvement retailer Home Depot and peer Lowe's are insulated from some of the retail woes because they're closely associated with the housing market, which continues to show healthy growth. And home repairs are a high priority for consumers, especially in springtime.Consensus is for Home Depot to record a 17% increase in earnings per share to $1.36 on a 7.1% hike in revenue to $22.37 billion. If it meets EPS expectations it would be the 12th quarter in a row of double-digit profit growth on a year over year basis.

The S&P 500 and Dow moved back above their 50-day moving averages on Monday as Apple rose on Buffett's stake, but then fell back as near-term Fed rate hike buzz took hold, pushing up the dollar. Thanks to Friday gains, the S&P 500, Dow and Nasdaq are slightly higher for the week.While some stocks broke out -- Salesforce and Lowe's -- older breakouts struggled. Facebook (FB) closed just below a buy point Thursday, though it regained its entry point on Friday. McDonald's (MCD) fell below its late March entry area.Minutes from the Federal Reserve’s April meeting showed policymakers are close to raising benchmark interest rates again next month, surprising Fed watchers who priced in an increase later in the year. But before raise rates for a second time, the Fed wants to see signs growth is picking up in Q2, along with stronger labor markets and inflation heading for the 2% target.New York Fed President William Dudley said the next day a rate hike in the June-July timeframe is reasonable, unless the economy stumbles. He said a June rate hike is ""definitely live."" Other policymakers made similar comments.

The lowered expectations also reflected lower spending on information technology overall.Well aware of the trends, Cisco is diversifying into newer, higher-growth segments such as software, data centers, security, wireless and the Internet of Things market.Cisco stock rose 5.4% for the week.The Energy Information Administration reported a domestic stockpile increase of 1.3 million barrels vs. a 3 million barrel decline expected by analysts.

But sales dropped 5% to $16.2 billion, missing estimates. Same-store sales grew 1.2%, short of predictions for a 1.6% gain.

Sonic (SONC) said it would miss its own fiscal Q3 same-store sales target, triggering an 8.65% weekly stock loss. The reports, which followed a weak May 11 sales outlook from Wendy’s (WEN), intensified fears about burger competition as both value and upscale offerings spread. Wendy’s stock fell 2.8%. Shake Shack (SHAK), which popped on solid results earlier this month, slid 6.9%. McDonald’s lost 4.9%.Campbell Soup (CPB) and Hormel (HRL) reported disappointing quarterly results, perhaps indicating that sluggish consumer spending is spilling over into the foods group.

210,ROST,"Retail-focused ETFs slumped Wednesday amid disappointing results from Fossil Group (FOSL), Walt Disney (DIS) and Macy's (M).Adding to retailers' woes, an analyst downgraded Ross Stores (ROST), and a federal judge blocked the $6.3 billion merger of Staples (SPLS) and Office Depot (ODP).Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR (XLY) dropped 2.0% on the stock market today, snapping a three-session win streak.SPDR S&P Retail (XRT) stumbled 4.4% to its lowest level since late February.Both exchange traded funds have big stakes in the hard-hit stocks.XLY holds 88 stocks, counting Walt Disney as its third-largest holding at nearly 7% portfolio weighting.XRT holds 97 equal-weighted stocks, including Office Depot, Staples and Ross Stores.Disney dropped 4% after its fiscal Q2 report missed analyst targets. Management noted a decline in ESPN subscribers and ad revenue.Fossil Group crumbled 29% to a 52-week low, as quarterly earnings and revenue fell more than expected. The company said challenges in the retail environment and in its wholesale channels had intensified.Macy’s likewise dropped to its lowest point in the past year, giving up 15%, after delivering mixed first-quarter results and lowering full-year guidance below expectations.Meanwhile, office supplies retailers Staples and OfficeDepot ended their planned merger deal after a federal judge granted an injunction against the combination, citing antitrust concerns. Staples plunged 18%, and Office Depot sank 41%.Discount retailer Ross Stores also got whacked, losing 5% after a Piper Jaffray downgrade on downside risk in a weakening consumer environment.Despite these woes, the consumer discretionary sector holds a better profit outlook than its peers.Consumer discretionary is one of three S&P sectors projected to have positive earnings growth for Q1, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. Its 20.2% estimated EPS growth rate tops the 10 S&P 500 sectors.For the full year, EPS growth is forecast at 12.5% -- far outpacing other sectors and the 0.2% average for the S&P 500.On the IBD Leaderboard, SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) rose for a second straight day, climbing 0.9%.

212,ROST,"What does it take to survive in a top job in a competitive, bottom-line industry? Win, baby! Long term.Larry Puglia has been at the helm of $30.7 billion T. Rowe Price Blue Chip Growth Fund (TRBCX) since mid-1993 and has been sole manager since May 1997.In that span, the fund has racked up a 9.97% average annual gain through April 29 vs. 9.02% for the S&P 500, says Morningstar Inc.Over the past three and five years through April 29, his fund's performance tops 94% and 97% of its direct rivals, respectively.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Six-Month LeadersThe fund captures an A+ 36-month Performance Rating from IBD, which means that its performance is among the top 5% of all mutual funds in that time.And the fund is an IBD Best Mutual Funds 2016 Awards winner, shining in three categories — U.S. equity funds, growth funds and large-caps.Puglia is himself among the tops in sheer longevity. He ranks 20th out of 558 managers of U.S. stock mutual funds that have had a single skipper.But he is not immune to market volatility: Year-to-date through April 29, the fund was down 5.64%, topping just 21% of its peers.Puglia, 55, spoke with IBD from his office in Baltimore about how he invests.IBD: What types of markets does your fund struggle in, Larry?Puglia: We like to think we can perform well in most environments. When I first started to work with Tom Broadus (co-manager of Blue Chip from mid-1993 until leaving the fund on May 1, 1997), he warned me that your investment style will sometimes be out of sync (with the market). Your job, he said, is to recognize that and lose as little as possible.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Categories' PerformanceWe paid a price for having less technology during the height of the tech bubble. But we were able to offset that ... when the market clobbered tech companies with very high valuations as the tech bubble burst.But our rolling three-year performance numbers have been solid against both the growth benchmark and the S&P 500. Our rolling five-year numbers have outperformed the benchmark 93% of the time. Sometimes things that seem unpopular -- like Amazon (AMZN) in 2013 and part of 2014 -- can reward you if you're right in your long-term analysis.IBD: What does ""Blue Chip"" in your fund's name say about your overall approach?Puglia: As we've talked about before, Paul, blue chips are those with leading market positions and seasoned management, and we pay close attention to management's ability to allocate capital. We've learned over time that if you have a great business that throws off superior returns, but management doesn't know how to reinvest wisely, the business is soon ""worsified,"" as I think Warren Buffett said.Having strong returns -- returns on invested capital, returns on equity -- is another characteristic we look for. And because there are vagaries to book accounting measures, we've always looked at free cash flow as an important measure for profitability. As a result, we tend to own the leaders or No. 2 companies in industries.Home Depot (HD) is important to us, but so is Lowe's (LOW). We're willing to own the No. 1 or No. 2 names in market share, especially if both are high-quality companies and well-managed.IBD: You're fairly reluctant to own smaller stocks. What are the exceptions?Puglia: We have been willing to own midcaps or some rapidly growing companies. We've owned Amazon and O'Reilly (ORLY) over a decade and Facebook (FB) as a private placement, the only one in our fund. Some view it as an early-stage growth company, but we view it as a company with a unique leadership position in an area growing rapidly.We owned Genentech before it was acquired by Roche (RHHBY), so we're willing to own rapid growers. But we try to discern as early as we can that they will have durable growth.IBD: Is Ross Stores (ROST) a play on a slow-growth economy in which consumers are careful about their spending? Or would this be an attractive stock even if the economy were growing gangbusters?Puglia: Historically, Ross and TJX Cos. (TJX) have been dominant in off-price retail. They've done well in most economic environments. Some of that is due to the fact that they are well below their saturation points in number of stores in the U.S. and especially internationally.In a slow-growth economy, other retailers have to unload overstock. They make fashion misses. So Ross and TJX get more pack-away inventory -- they take unwanted merchandise off other retailers' hands, pack it away and sell it at good margins over time.IBD: PayPal (PYPL) is still trying to get back to where it went public. Where does this fit into your strategy?Puglia: This is an example of where we started our conversation. This is a high-quality but emerging blue chip.They are leading in their area of expertise. But because it was born (went public) early in its gestation, it has certain frailties. If certain other payment companies wanted to gang up and hurt PayPal, they could succeed somewhat.But instead, PayPal has a collaborative relationship with Visa (V), where we also have a position.And PayPal has broadened itself. They bought Venmo, a consumer-to-consumer network (that lets users transfer money to each other). It's growing rapidly. And it cornered Braintree, which can process debit and credit transactions (for many devices, and is used by online and mobile firms such as Uber and Airbnb).IBD: Which do you like more about Amazon -- what it is now, or what it has the potential to become?Puglia: In the last three to four years, they've invested heavily in building out their network of warehouses, distribution centers and related inventory management capabilities. They've also built out their free-delivery ability and more rapid delivery to attract more Prime members, who spend over twice as much as other customers and have higher retention rates.We've felt that the company should be valued on free cash flow, and that's going to move up dramatically because the third-party business (selling and distributing products for third-party sellers) and Amazon Web Services (AWS) should grow very rapidly. And both have much higher margins than their core retailing business, which is doing fine. And we feel the third-party business and AWS’ margins would improve over time.The real story is that the third-party and AWS businesses should pull their composite gross margin up very dramatically. That's happened, and we think it will continue.But predicting free cash flow for them is tricky because if they build, say, two more distribution centers, that can absorb a lot of free cash flow.Another way to think about the company is that AWS is, in our minds, worth well over half of the company based on our analysis of growth in that business. People don't appreciate that.IBD: Are you bothered by Broadcom's (AVGO) slowdown in earnings-per-share growth?Puglia: The growth rate is slowing temporarily because we're coming out of a big downturn.Now, Broadcom's acquisition of Avago is going to be accretive to earnings over time. Avago management has shown the ability to improve the profile of their product set. There's talk that they might sell parts of the business and what we'll end up with is a higher-quality business.When they're finished with restructuring, they will look like Texas Instruments (TXN) but trade at a lower multiple.Just in the last year, we came back into both of these names (Broadcom and its now-subsidiary Avago).IBD: O'Reilly Automotive is a cyclical play because people want to fix cars in a slow-growth economy rather than buy new ones. It's also a secular play because they're taking share in the repair-shop market. Is there a third element you like?Puglia: They are really extraordinarily well-managed. They key success factor is being able to distribute product to a mechanic or repair shop in a short time frame. They need parts within minutes, within the hour. And O'Reilly has distribution nodes and warehouses that can get product to repair shops in a very short time.That took a lot of investment and expertise.AutoZone (AZO) is also moving aggressively into the do-it-for-me market. They've been in the do-it-yourselfer market. Both companies have performed well and are taking market share. They're well-managed and have room to penetrate the total addressable market. And these are businesses that are less likely to be disintermediated by Amazon. Home Depot and Lowe's are the same.IBD: Does Constellation Brands' (STZ) growth come from acquisitions?Puglia: The reason it's grown in the last 12 to 24 months is their fortuitous and smart acquisition of Corona and Modelo and Pacifico and other Mexican specialty beers that were spun out as a result of mergers elsewhere in the industry.They have a wine business that has been a slower grower. But they've acquired Prisoner Wines and other specialty wines. They're smart in wines, and that business is poised to grow.IBD: Some people love to doubt Facebook (FB). You like the stock, right?Puglia: Yes, we're constructive. While it is inevitable that growth will slow, it is being sustained at a very high level.The stock has been robust because they've managed the transition to mobile devices much better than people thought they could. That will constitute their next leg of (share-price) growth: having that transition understood.Also, they've made several acquisitions in recent years that are not well understood (by many investors). Instagram now has 400 million users. What's App now has 800 million users, up from 500 million. And Messenger has a ton of users. As those businesses are monetized, they'll provide a new level of growth layered onto their core business, which is already seeing rapid growth due to video, for example.They'll earn in the $4s -- call it $4.50 per share in calendar 2017. They could be pushing a $6 number in calendar '18.IBD: Can Alaska Air (ALK) keep flying high despite the cost of the Virgin America (VA) takeover?Puglia: This is an interesting situation. Some of the most difficult decisions are when we have a high-quality company like Alaska, with the best balance sheet of any major airline, and then they make an acquisition and pay more than we would like. But they didn't have much flexibility because JetBlue (JBLU) was trying to buy Virgin too.Less appreciated is that Alaska gets important gates in Newark, LaGuardia, Kennedy and Dulles. Those are important airports, especially in relation to the West Coast.We hate strategic deals when you pay too much. But the more we look at it, the more we think it will be accretive.IBD: If you had a mentor, who was it?Puglia: I've had several. My father as a businessman who invested on his own over about 50 years. He had a growth-at-a-reasonable price style. He lived through the Depression, so he liked firms with earnings and cash flow. That influenced me.He also had an eye for new growth areas. He had seen new industries created, like TV and copying machines. And he never invested in gold. He always said, ""It can't innovate, it can't grow."" That focus on looking for companies that compound and grow has been a great influence.Jack Laporte (who ran New Horizons Fund (PRNHX) from 1987 until 2010) taught me that a few winners can make a big difference in growth investing. They can offset many losing stocks.And I mentioned Tom Broadus (who ran and co-ran Blue Chip from June 30, 1993, through May 1, 1997, with a 21.64% average annual return topping 95% of its peers, and whose Oct. 31, 1985-March 1, 1994, tenure atop Equity Income generated a 14.98% average annual gain, topping 86% of its peers) taught me to make sure that the managers of companies we're interested in really follow through on things they say they're going to do.And I learned from Brian Rogers (T. Rowe Price chairman and chief investment officer, who ran Equity Income (PRFDX) from 1985 to 2015), even though he is a value investor.Rogers once said to me that consistent thought and action were important. The most grievous mistakes he had made were trades he knew he should have made (but hadn't). He taught me to make sure my portfolio reflected my best thinking. Now, several times a week, I review why I own every single name. If I don't believe in a holding, I reduce or end it. That's especially valuable for growth investors. If a growth name is not compounding, that is dangerous.

216,ROST,"One of Burlington Coat Factory's biggest obstacles in recent years might have been right there in the retailer's name: coats. There was a bit too much emphasis on coats, many believed, and not enough on T-shirts, dresses, table linens, fragrances, makeup and other things that exist outside the business of cold winters — in essence, the sales opportunities for retailers in the other three seasons.But after being taken private a decade ago and public again in 2013, the off-price chain — now called Burlington Stores (BURL) — has tried to turn that perception around. Perhaps most importantly, Burlington has put more effort into expanding and improving its home, beauty and women's sportswear items, which can work better as gifts and draw more store traffic in the non-winter months. ""And now obviously they don't call themselves Burlington Coat Factory,"" RBC analyst Brian Tunick told IBD. ""So that should be some signal to you and the shoppers that they used to make (all) of their profits in the holiday quarter, and they would live and die by the cold winter.""In years past, coats made up nearly a third of annual sales, according to RBC, but the company says that as of 2015 they were down to 6%. And as larger rivals Ross Stores (ROST) and TJX (TJX) pick away at ailing higher-end department stores, investors appear to believe that Burlington Stores has ample room to do the same as it adds more types of products to its racks and shelves. ""Those are businesses that help 'de-weatherize' the company,"" Tunick said. In the process, over the past year, shares of Burlington, whose roots trace back to the 1920s, have outperformed off-price rivals and specialty retailers that have been increasingly worn down by Amazon.com (AMZN) and discount wars. Burlington's stock price has more than doubled since the end of 2015, compared to the 22% gain for Ross Stores and the 7% gain for TJX. Burlington's stock has a solid IBD Composite Rating of 79 as of Thursday, coming off higher levels seen earlier.Those gains also come as more customers, particularly those who are low-income or with finances still fragile after the recession, choose value over brand name when they shop. ""(Burlington) stands to benefit from a secular shift in consumer demand to the off-price format in both the long-term and near-term,"" Guggenheim analyst Robert Drbul said in a November research note.
"
217,ROST,"Unlike higher-end stores, off-price stores like Burlington, Ross and TJX get a bit more protection from Amazon due to the experience of actually shopping at their stores. In that so-called ""treasure hunt,"" shoppers walk in, don't entirely know what they're going to buy, stumble upon a marked-down item, buy it, and come back hoping to be pleasantly surprised again.""Our assortments are broad and shallow,"" the company said in a written statement. ""In other words, we don't like to have more than six of any particular style in a store. If you see it, you better buy it or it won't be there the next time you come in.""That experience, for now, is difficult to duplicate online. Burlington and TJX get less than 1% of their sales from their websites, while Ross doesn't even have an e-commerce operation, Tunick said. Even as Burlington broadens the treasure hunt for home, women's, accessories and footwear lines, the expansion is still well behind that of other off-price rivals, leaving the company room to grow more, RBC notes.Burlington's store count at the end of 2015 was around 40% of Ross' and around a fifth of TJX's, making it ""significantly underpenetrated throughout the United States compared to its peers"" TJX and Ross, Drbul said in the research note.Burlington, however, also has a large men's tailored clothing area and other ""special occasion"" wear, as well as Baby Depot, which sells baby clothing and other supplies — areas intended to keep the chain different from rivals. The company's still-large supply of coats and other winter-wear — RBC in August forecast that 56% of Burlington's earnings per share for 2016 would come from the fourth quarter — also help to set it apart, even as it puts more of a focus elsewhere. Those segments keep the average store sizes of Burlington bigger than its rivals. But average store sizes and inventory have begun to shrink as the company moves away from selling so many coats. The company in the past few years has also begun using ""pack away"" inventory, in which a retailer purchases products on the cheap and sells them later, giving it more flexibility with the vendors from which Burlington buys excess goods.IBD'S TAKE: While malls become miniature ghost towns, off-price retailers are still largely gaining in store traffic. Elsewhere in the discount retail space, discount grocery stores are also largely insulated from e-commerce. Burlington's buying model, the company said, also makes the chain more flexible when retailers cancel orders due to events like warmer winters, backups at ports and hurricanes — all of which have happened in recent years.But even as the company tries to make its profits less winter-dependent and works to draw more high-quality vendors, analysts say Burlington has work to do in shedding its ""coat factory"" reputation. Seemingly around-the-clock discounting in the retail space, along with Burlington's store sizes, could still weigh on sales and margins. And Burlington, for now, still depends a lot on the winter, and even that's not a guarantee.""Last winter was the warmest winter ever,"" Tunick said, after a harsh cold snap in 2013 and 2014, and some massive snowstorms in the 2014-15 winter. ""So no one quite knows,"" he added.Still, Burlington's store makeover and broader product offerings could help customers stick around, rather than flock to higher-end stores, if the economy improves and states boost minimum wages. Low gas prices and cheap groceries could also free up more room for spending. And amid erratic weather patterns, more giftable items in the fragrance and bath-and-body categories could help prop up the company if future winters stay warmer. And analysts like the company's prospects under President-elect Donald Trump. If Trump cuts taxes, that helps. But if he hacks away at international trade deals, Burlington would still be in decent shape, given that much of what the company sells is bought from third-party vendors, as opposed to having a whole lot of those items sourced directly from a country like Mexico. The company declined to speculate on how a Trump administration might affect business. But other analysts felt that the company could stay comfortable regardless of who had won the office in the November election. Cowen analyst John Kernan wrote in a research note in October that Burlington was well positioned due to its plans to offset payroll increases with ongoing expense-control programs, as well as the potential for rising lower and middle incomes to help build its customer base.Kernan also wrote that Burlington had a ""modest exposure to global trade issues and foreign exchange rate fluctuations."" Shares of Burlington gapped up in late November and have remained above the 80 level since then. On Monday, shares were up marginally to 85.49.RELATED: How Instagram, Twitter Beauty Selfies Are Changing The Face Of RetailWhich Retailer Will Win Christmas This Year?

221,ROST,"T.J. Maxx and Marshalls parent TJX (TJX) could outperform Macy’s (M) domestically in 2017, says Credit Suisse.While the firm said it remains cautious on the off-price sector, noting its high square-footage growth amid the entry of new competitors, it also noted the industry's improved sales productivity.“If current trends continue, we expect that sometime in 2017 that TJX's domestic annualized sales (for Marmaxx and HomeGoods) will exceed that of Macy's -- the largest department store in the U.S, by sales,” wrote Credit Suisse analyst Michael Exstein.This is important, he explains, because department stores ""create legitimacy"" when it comes to the brands and price points offered for a significant chunk of the products stocked by off-price retailers.“This raises significant strategic questions of what happens next for the off-price industry,” he said. “How do they sustain their value proposition as the gap in sales and, in turn, customer reach narrows further between themselves and department stores? How long will the vendor community tolerate the high returns enjoyed by off price as they continue to function strictly as a conduit from vendor to retail customer?”TJX shares closed up 1.3% at 78.62 and are now extended above their 78.49 buy-range ceiling.The company also announced Tuesday that it had bumped up its quarterly dividend by 24%, to 26 cents per share, and plans to buy back $1.5 billion to $2 billion in shares in fiscal 2017.Macy's shares rose less than 0.1%.Of the off-price companies in its coverage -- TJX, Ross Stores (ROST), Burlington Stores (BURL) and Stein Mart (SMRT) -- Credit Suisse said the group's collective share price index rose 23% in 2015, ahead of the 18% decline of its mall anchor index and the S&P 500's 13% gain last year.So far this year, its off-price index has gained at close to the same pace as mall anchors.RELATED:Ross Stores: A No-Nonsense Retailer Free From Amazon’s ClutchesMacy’s Downgraded As Amazon Poses ‘Increasing Threat’

222,ROST,"Lululemon Athletica (LULU) is getting some love from analysts ahead of its fourth-quarter earnings report, as the company's too-sheer yoga pants and controversial founder's comments of yesteryear are becoming a distant memory.The yoga apparel company's profits are seen edging up almost 3% to 80 cents a share when it reports results Wednesday. Analysts expect revenue to grow 15% to $693.4 million.Shares fell 0.6% to 60.52 in the stock market today, just above their 50-day line at 60.48. Lululemon Athletica logged a 17% EPS decline and 14% revenue rise in its previous quarter.Lululemon has a devoted following, but its offerings face mounting competition not just from athletic peers Nike (NKE) and Under Armour (UA), but also from a swath of other companies looking to capitalize on the ""athleisure"" apparel style that remains in vogue.Outlook for the year ahead will guide Lululemon's shares following the earnings report.""Sentiment is bullish ahead of 4Q, but a conservative 1Q guide could drive (near-term) downside given its recent run,"" wrote Morgan Stanley analyst Kimberly Greenberger in mid-March. ""Any pullback creates a buying opportunity, as we see upward EPS revisions and a strong year ahead.""Greenberger, who calls Lululemon the investment bank's ""favorite turnaround story,"" has an overweight rating and 68 price target on the stock.Three years ago, Lululemon had to deal with a recall debacle involving a crop of yoga pants that exposed more than consumers were hoping for. Later in the year, Lululemon founder Chip Wilson told Bloomberg that some women's bodies just ""don't work"" for the pant, a comment that many perceived as a slam on heavier customers. Wilson resigned from Lululemon's board a little over a year ago.Analysts are now looking past all that.""The logistics issues of 2Q '15 and 3Q '15 will be fully behind the company by 2016,"" wrote Sterne Agee CRT analyst Sam Poser, who rates the stock a buy with a 68 price target.

226,ROST,"Shares of Coca-Cola (KO), one of Warren Buffett's ""Big Four"" investments, touched an all-time high Tuesday as consumer stocks continued to show strength amid the recent market volatility.Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) has 400 million shares, or a 9.3% stake, in Coca-Cola. American Express (AXP), IBM (IBM) and Wells Fargo (WFC) are the rest of Berkshire's top four stock holdings.Coca-Cola shares closed down 0.1% at 45.24 on the stock market today after rising as high as 45.56 earlier.

Growth over the last three quarters has improved from -14% to -8% and -6% last quarter. Wall Street consensus is for the company's EPS this quarter to be flat on a year-over-year basis; it's expected to then return to growth, posting a 3% increase next quarter.The company on Feb. 18 said that it was raising its quarterly divided to 35 cents a share from 33 cents, prompting RBC Capital analyst Nik Modi to say in a report that Coke is about to kick off a long-term bull run that could last three to eight years.Coke joins other consumer stocks, such as McDonald's (MCD), Home Depot (HD), Domino's Pizza (DPZ) and and Ross Stores (ROST), which are all trading in record high territory.McDonald's rose to a new high close at 124.61 on Feb. 1.

230,ROST,"Look up ""sad mall"" or ""dead mall"" online and you're likely to be confronted with images of desolate, shuttered shopping centers that have been left for dead. Overgrown plants crack through abandoned storefronts; crumbled tile litters broken-down escalators. It's a common-enough phenomenon that entire photography projects revolve around the state of the country's retail centers.Is this what 2017 holds for American shoppers?Not quite, but the upcoming year isn't exactly going to be a cakewalk, either. The hundreds of collective store closures (from Macy's (M), Wal-Mart (WMT) and others, combined) and bankruptcies (Sports Authority, Sports Chalet) in 2016 are enough to make even the most devoted shopaholic wonder if the future of commerce is one big Amazon.com (AMZN) screen.""It's going to be a year of transition and a year of reckoning and a year of awakening for retailers,"" said Marshal Cohen, NPD Group's chief industry analyst.Retail sales excluding autos and gasoline rose 4% from Nov. 1 to Dec. 24, according to MasterCard's SpendingPulse. That suggests a stronger-than-expected holiday season, perhaps reflecting more optimistic consumers. But while digital sales continued to boom, with Amazon grabbing an ever-larger e-commerce share, brick-and-mortar locations faced declining traffic. And those trends are likely to intensify into the new year.The big discounts offered at apparel stores this holiday season echoed prior sales-heavy years, particularly 2015's. While retailers generally went into this important shopping period claiming that inventories were lean, stores feel they have no choice in an already cutthroat environment.""Consumers have been trained that if they hold out, they will get a promotion,"" said Morningstar analyst Bridget Weishaar. ""The other problem is that it's a really overcrowded space with no barriers to entry. A lot of retailers are choosing to compete on price.""IBD'S TAKE: What's holding Amazon back from becoming a major player in beauty? For an in-depth look, read: ""Why Amazon Has Been Powerless Against Beauty Stores.""Retail Metrics President Ken Perkins said that outside of a few busy hours on the weekends, Holiday 2016 was ""somewhat eerily quiet"" at the mall.During store checks, his research firm observed but a ""handful of people"" at Foot Locker (FL), Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF) brand Hollister, American Eagle Outfitters (AEO) and Macy's. L Brands' (LB) Bath & Body Works ""always seems to have a buzz,"" he said, but even Apple (AAPL) stores seemed less bustling than in years' past.""Each year it feels like that lull is a bit deeper and deeper,"" said Perkins.Some of the lag can be attributed to holiday promotions being pushed up earlier in November, said NPD's Cohen, spreading out the spending. But the perhaps greater problem is the lack of product innovation and uniqueness on shelves, he said.In other words, there's not enough new, fun stuff to buy — for other people or for self-gifting purposes.NPD, which tracks the November-December shopping period week by week, said in its latest report that as of the week ending Dec. 10, dollar sales in the first six weeks of the holiday retail season were lagging the prior-year period by 4%.Brick-and-mortar traffic fell about 10% at stores through Dec. 17, according to Prodco Retail Traffic Index.One saving grace for brick-and-mortar locations: Christmas Eve — also the start of Hanukkah this year — was on a Saturday, while Dec. 26 was also a day off.The issues that faced retailers in 2016 are likely to continue to face them in 2017, without much abatement. Perkins highlighted the ongoing shift to online and mobile spending, a consumer taste for experiences instead of products, high promotional activity and a ""hollowing out"" of the middle class that leaves less disposable income on the table.And, of course, Amazon's insistent gains. On top of Prime shipping and Prime Video, the company's smart-home device, Alexa, can help Prime members place orders.""(Alexa) cuts retailer out of the equation for consumers that are pressed for time,"" he said.Upper-tier malls — the kind that house Tiffanys (TIF) and Louis Vuittons and Shake Shacks (SHAK) — are expected to continue to perform well enough. But the average mall might still see some individual stores close up shop, say experts, unless they go out of their way to attract more foot traffic.""Mid-tier malls are going to need to step up their game"" with restaurants, movie theaters and lifestyle stores, said NPD's Cohen, adding that ""the food court won't be good enough.""Simon Property Group (SPG), a major mall operator, has tumbled 24% over the last five months, sinking Wednesday to the lowest level in nearly 16 months.That young people are doing more mobile shopping and are craving experiences is no surprise. But how retailers respond may foreshadow the brick-and-mortar industry's fate.Wal-Mart (WMT) investments (which include its e-commerce efforts) may weigh on short-term income growth but lead to foreseeable rewards in the future, said Perkins, whose store checks found that Wal-Mart has been ""one of the busier stores"" this season.In 2017, the top-performers list should feature some familiar names, by Perkins' estimate. Home Depot (HD) and Lowe's (LOW) are ""two of the strongest performers in retail."" He also sees off-price trio TJX (TJX), Ross Stores (ROST) and Burlington (BURL) continuing to do well, as well as Ulta Beauty (ULTA), which is ""obviously a standout player.""Home improvement, off-price and beauty all involve some element of in-store necessity: looking for just the right part, digging through bargain racks and trying on new makeup brands are usually best done in person.Department stores have had a choppy year, though Nordstrom (JWN) frequently gets a shout-out from analysts for being an ""omnichannel"" retailer that knows how to engage its customers across platforms. And unlike Macy's or Kohl's (KSS), which compete ""with Amazon and everyone else on the internet,"" says Morningstar's Weishaar, Nordstrom has differentiated itself by catering to more affluent shoppers with a highly curated selection.""If you go to Amazon and type in 'red dress,' you're going to get literally hundreds of pages of results to sift through that (are) not useful,"" she said. ""If you go to Nordstrom, you're going to get 10 (products in line with) your price points and brands.""Even so, Nordstrom was recently handed a downgrade from JPMorgan after the department store's management team said brick-and-mortar levels hadn't been that bad since 1972.In the future, being omnichannel might not be enough, particularly in a world increasingly populated by Alexa and Google Home devices.Retail ""omnipresence"" is key, said NPD's Cohen.That is, instead of simply giving customers a way to buy products both in-store and online, it would behoove retailers to latch onto shoppers before, during and after the transaction, he said. Educate them and anticipate their needs ahead of potential transactions, allow them different ways to buy, then stay in touch via product reviews or other methods following the purchase.The goal, said Cohen, is ""that the store becomes the epicenter for the entire process.""RELATED:Amazon's Top Selling Holiday Products Came From ...

236,ROST,"The biggest stock market winners of the past century typically showed strong profit growth for at least three years before beginning their big advances, according to IBD research.Annual earnings growth is so important that it has its own letter -- ""A"" -- in IBD's CAN SLIM investing system acronym.To find the stocks with the potential for the greatest price gains, look for companies with annual profit growth of at least 25% over three to five years. Such companies typically boast new products or services that take market share or create new markets, as Apple (AAPL) did with its iPhones, Mac computers and iPads.Full-year earnings estimates are also key, as they can flag up-and-coming growth companies.“It’s the combination of strong earnings in the last several quarters plus a record of solid growth in the recent years that creates a superb stock, or at least one with a higher probability of success during an uptrending general market,” IBD founder William O’Neil wrote in “How to Make Money in Stocks.”Annual earnings-per-share figures can be found in minicharts throughout IBD, including the IBD 50 and Stock Spotlight. The data can also be found in IBD Stock Checkup at Investors.com.Lately, few companies have been able to post robust EPS growth because of the sluggish economy. As a result, many slower-growing defensive stocks had replaced growth stocks in the IBD 50 earlier this year. They include real estate investment trusts such as CoreSite Realty (COR) and big cap stocks like Ross Stores (ROST), which tend to perform better in slow-growth environments.But pockets of strong growth remain. A select number of IBD 50 stocks with strong annual earnings growth are listed in the accompanying table. They include Facebook (FB), which enjoys three- and five-year earnings and sales growth rates of more than 50%.Of course, not all stocks that meet the A in CAN SLIM will turn into winners. It's also important to consider criteria such as sales growth, return on equity, and profit margins before buying a stock. And in all cases, investors should wait for each stock to form a proper base and clear its buy point in strong volume before buying.Strong profit growth that's accompanied by weak sales growth could be a sign that a company is cutting costs to boost profits. Or, if sales growth exceeds profit growth and margins are shrinking, it may mean the company’s costs are too high or its products are facing tough competition.

Volume in the stock market today edged up 1% on the NYSE but dipped 6% on the Nasdaq compared to Tuesday, according to preliminary data.Defensive stocks such as steelmakers and miners led the gains, but solar stocks also fared well, led by SolarEdge Technologies (SEDG), which popped 8% in heavy volume and retook its 10-week and 40-week moving averages.The Israel-based company, which went public in March last year, has posted strong sales and profit growth in recent quarters.

The stock jumped more than 8% and retook its 50-day line Feb. 18 after posting a much better-than-expected 21% gain in profit for the fiscal fourth quarter that ended in January.While the overall chip sector remains weak, chip designers, manufacturers and equipment makers have been showing strength.Ross Stores (ROST) led the IBD 50 higher, climbing nearly 3% in heavy volume following a better-than-expected quarterly earnings report. However, the company's guidance for the current year trailed analysts' forecasts due in part to concerns about the economy.Meanwhile, Monsanto (MON) led the S&P 500 lower, plunging 8% after the provider of corn and other crop seeds slashed its 2016 outlook due to a strong dollar, stiffer competition and lower commodity prices.Broadcom (AVGO), Smith & Wesson (SWHC), Trina Solar (TSL) and Kroger (KR) are among companies scheduled to report quarterly earnings Thursday.Economic data due Thursday include factory orders for January, revised Q4 productivity figures, the Institute for Supply Management's index of service sector activity for February, and initial jobless claims for the week ended Feb. 27.

241,ROST,"Core consumer prices, excluding food and energy, rose 0.2% in February, but the annual inflation rate held steady at 1.8%, undershooting expectations, the Labor Department reported on Tuesday.X The soft inflation reading could slightly lower odds of a fourth Fed interest-rate hike in 2018. After the report, Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures extended gains, with the major averages opening modestly higher on the stock market today. The 10-year Treasury yield pointed lower.The overall consumer price index rose 0.2% on the month and 2.2% from a year ago, matching expectations.The Fed is expected to hike rates three times this year, with quarter-point moves, as the economy looks headed for relatively strong growth and the jobless rate could sink to a multidecade low. Fed policymakers expect that wage pressures will rise as unemployment falls, leading companies to pass on some of their higher wage bills in the form of price increases.So far, official measures haven't detected a pickup in wages. The Labor Department reported weaker-than-expected 2.6% annual average hourly wage inflation in February. But faster wage growth should begin to show up this spring, reflecting recently announced wage hikes from Walmart (WMT), Target (TGT), CVS Health (CVS) and Starbucks (SBUX) that didn't happen soon enough for the latest jobs report.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

Last week, Kroger (KR), Dollar Tree (DLTR) and Ross Stores (ROST) all said they're raising wages for employees, and their stocks sold off amid worries about profit margins.The competitive environment facing Kroger from Walmart and Amazon.com (AMZN) via its Whole Foods division, among others, offers at least some reason to doubt whether wage pressure will feed through to higher prices. Kroger said on Thursday that it will use one-third of its tax cut to boost shareholder returns, but the other two-thirds will go to higher wages and lower prices.Yet even doves on the Fed are beginning to sound more hawkish. ""Although last year we faced a disconnect between the continued strengthening in the labor market and the step-down in inflation, mounting tailwinds at a time of full employment and above-trend growth tip the balance of considerations in my view,"" Fed Governor Lael Brainard said last week.Bottom line: Inflation is going to remain a concern for Wall Street throughout 2018.The soft inflation reading came as medical care services inflation was unchanged in February, after January's 0.6% monthly gain, and prices for medical care commodities including prescription drugs slipped 0.3%.Meanwhile, prices for food away from home rose 0.2%, while the cost of food consumed at home fell 0.2%, more evidence of the competition from Amazon in the grocery arena.Outside of energy, inflation is showing up in transportation services, whose prices rose 1.0% on the month and 4.5% from a year ago.

242,ROST,"If the February jobs report out Friday morning comes in as strong as Wall Street expects, it will set financial markets up for another Fed interest-rate scare later this spring.X Here's the reason: Economists expect the new jobs data to match January's 2.9% hourly annual wage gain — the best since 2009. That's even though that surprising data point appeared inflated by a dive in the work week that disproportionately reduced hours for low-wage workers. But even bigger pay gains are likely coming this spring, reflecting recently announced wage hikes from Walmart (WMT), Target (TGT), CVS Health (CVS) and Starbucks (SBUX), which won't show up yet in the February jobs report.And as those companies hike wages, their competitors are being pressured to do the same. This week, Kroger (KR), Dollar Tree (DLTR) and Ross Stores (ROST) all said they're raising wages for employees, and their stocks sold off amid worries about profit margins.Wall Street also expects that the jobless rate dipped to 4.0% in February for the first time since 2000, as the economy added a robust 205,000 jobs.Use IBD's MarketSmith For Free Until March 11

Start NowThe combination of low and falling unemployment with accelerating wage gains fits perfectly with the Phillips curve theory that has long guided Federal Reserve policy. As far as investors are concerned, the key point is that most Fed policymakers still seem pretty confident that inflation pressures won't follow too far behind wage pressures, as businesses pass along a portion of their higher wage bills.That's why an interest-rate scare is looking increasingly likely, even if a legitimate inflation scare doesn't materialize.Yet the competitive environment facing Kroger from Walmart and Amazon.com (AMZN) via its Whole Foods division, among others, offers at least some reason to doubt whether wage pressure will feed through to higher prices. Kroger said on Thursday that it will use one-third of its tax cut to boost shareholder returns, but the other two-thirds will go to higher wages and lower prices.Kroger gave weak profit guidance as it forecast smaller profit margins, sending shares crashing 12% on Thursday.Walmart's minimum-wage hike to $11 an hour was its first for new, entry-level workers since 2015, when it raised its minimum wage to $9 an hour. Then, in early 2016, Walmart hiked pay for all current associates to a minimum of $10 an hour, leading Target, Costco (COST) and others to raise their own wages. The point is that wage hikes can come in bunches. It didn't really happen last year, when wage growth hit a bit of a lull. But it does appear to be happening in 2018.If it does, Wall Street will continue to bump up odds for a fourth rate hike in 2018.

244,ROST,"The U.S. economy added 313,000 jobs in February, while the unemployment rate held at 4.1%, the Labor Department said on Friday.X Average hourly wages rose 4 cents to $26.75 an hour, up a tame 2.6% from a year earlier. That missed consensus expectations of 2.9% rise. January's wage gain, originally reported as a 2.9% rise, was revised down to 2.8%.Wall Street expected a gain of 205,000 jobs and 4.0% jobless rate.December and January payrolls were revised up by a combined 54,000.After the jobs report, the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq 100 futures moved significantly higher on the stock market today. The S&P 500 index, which closed a point below its 50-day moving average on Thursday, reclaimed that key level at Friday's open.The 10-year Treasury yield rose a few basis points to 2.9% but the jobs and wage data didn't substantially bolster the case for the Federal Reserve to add an extra interest-rate hike in 2018.Despite the blowout jobs number, the data may give stocks a tad more running room before Fed hike expectations begin to bite, but investors shouldn't take too much comfort.While the data don't show that Goldilocks-type wage gains are history, bigger pay gains are likely coming this spring, reflecting recently announced wage hikes from Walmart (WMT), Target (TGT), CVS Health (CVS) and Starbucks (SBUX), which don't show up yet in the February jobs report.And as those companies hike wages, their competitors are being pressured to do the same. This week, Kroger (KR), Dollar Tree (DLTR) and Ross Stores (ROST) all said they're raising wages for employees, and their stocks sold off amid worries about profit margins.The retail sector added 50,000 jobs, while construction employment surged 61,000 and manufacturers hired a net 31,000.The likely combination of low and falling unemployment with accelerating wage gains would fit perfectly with the Phillips curve theory that has long guided Federal Reserve policy.

253,ROST,"Ross Stores (ROST) will raise its minimum hourly wage for eligible employees to $10 from $9 in the second quarter to attract stronger talent, the off-price retailer said Tuesday, matching Wal-Mart’s (WMT) plans for a hike to $10 this year.The planned increase, discussed on Ross’ Q4 earnings call, echoed similar moves from retailers last year, when Wal-Mart raised wages to a minimum of $9 per hour. After Wal-Mart's pay hike, retailers like Ross, off-price rival TJX (TJX) and Target (TGT) followed.The planned pay hike also weighed on Ross’s full-year earnings per share guidance of $2.59-$2.71, which missed forecasts for $2.75. Comparable-store sales are seen rising 1% to 2%. For Q1, the company sees EPS of 69-72 cents, lower than views for 76 cents.The dimmer forecast comes amid broader fears of a recession, more aggressive off-price offerings from Macy’s and Nordstrom, and pressures for better accommodations for labor across the industry.“As we enter 2016, we continue to face our own challenging multiyear comparisons in an increasingly uncertain and volatile macroeconomic and retail environment,” Ross CEO Barbara Rentler said in a statement.“As a result, while we hope to do better, we believe it is prudent to maintain a somewhat cautious outlook when forecasting sales and earnings for the coming year.”Q4 earnings per share rose 10% to 66 cents, topping by 2 cents. Sales increased 7% to $3.25 billion, edging past views for $3.21 billion. Comps rose 4%.Those results came despite tough holiday promotions from rivals. The Midwest continued to be Ross’s strongest performer, while its largest region, California, outpaced the company’s average.Shares were up 0.75% after hours in the stock market today. The stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 96, having cleared a consolidation in January but fizzling in the days after.

Revenue shot up 117% to $5.37 billion, thanks to the company’s Family Dollar takeover, but still missed estimates for $5.41 billion.For the year, the company guided for $3.35-$3.65 a share in earnings, below forecasts for $3.76 a share. The midpoint of targeted revenue of $20.76 billion-$21.11 billion is a hair above current estimates for $20.93 billion.Dollar Tree shares closed up 2.2%.

The last monthly gain for both indexes came in November.Friday's payroll report for February is the big economic news scheduled for the week.

263,ROST,"The off-price channel continues to show strength as TJX (TJX) posted fourth-quarter results that comfortably topped expectations and announced a dividend hike and share buyback. Separately, big-box retailer Target (TGT) missed views but its same-store sales and better-than-expected guidance were enough to reassure Wall Street.TJX's Q4 earnings rose 6.5% to 99 cents per share, a nickel above views. Revenue grew 8% to $8.96 billion, ahead of forecasts for $8.73 billion. Same-store sales rose 6%, with positive comp growth in all segments. TJX is the parent company of T.J.

The only question is who will show up draped in Michael Kors.Kors and other fashion houses like Coach (COH) and Kate Spade (KATE) have had a rough go of it lately, but Kors' holiday-quarter results exceeded expectations, sending its stock back on the road to stardom with a nearly 24% pop on Feb. 2. And IBD's apparel manufacturer's industry group is climbing the ranks.Kors shares closed Friday up 0.2% at 56.58. That's still a long way off from its all-time high of 101.04 two years ago on Feb. 28, 2014, but Hollywood, like Wall Street, loves a comeback story.Jennifer Lawrence will probably show up in Dior again, but after the Academy Awards -- and the after-parties -- it's a fair bet that celebs are probably rocking a comfy chic look the morning after.And consumers looking to dupe their favorite ""just got out of SoulCycle"" look might head to Ross Stores or TJX (TJX) for off-price brand names.Ross has been looking better than some of its struggling retail peers, particularly those in the department-store category.

Now, Ryanair has got its sights set on the business set as it hopes to gain share of that market.Shares dipped 0.4%.

No, not Donald Trump.They've all recently rallied off their lows but are at various stages of trending higher.SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) is 5% below its 52-week high. PowerShares QQQ (QQQ) is next, with an 8% gap. Small-cap iShares Russell 2000 (IWM) is 16% shy of the mark.SPY has been making lower highs and lower lows in the past year.

Investors seem to feel more optimistic about job growth and manufacturing at home and less bothered by the picture of disarray abroad.SPY set a 2016 high of 202.81 Friday, a nice turnaround for the largest U.S. exchange traded fund.Last month, it was down about 15% from its 52-week high. It's now trading 5% off that level.Here's a look at five top IBD 50 stocks that have contributed to its comeback:PayPal (PYPL) stock seems ready to bolt to new highs, a positive sign. The company is a lead player in the electronic payments industry. It has grown earnings 16% annually over the past three years and sales 18%.But company officials are no doubt looking in the rearview mirror. Wall Street banks are getting more aggressive about making inroads in the mobile payments field.Ross Stores (ROST), the biggest discount apparel retailer, has been described as a retail pick that could hold up even in a recession.  The stock is trading near its highest levels since December 2013.Ross has eight straight quarters of earnings and sales growth under its belt. But the company's latest full-year guidance lagged expectations on plans to hike wages and amid retail uncertainties.Edwards Lifesciences (EW) makes treatment for cardiovascular diseases, including heart valve disorders. Global sales of aortic valve products could exceed $5 billion, according to the company. The medical company has six quarters of double-digit earnings growth. Its stock is trading near multiyear highs as well.AT&T (T) touched a 52-week high Friday. The telecom stock, a defensive play, has held up amid a young market uptrend. Its 5% yield makes AT&T a coveted stock among income investors. Growth has been accelerating in recent quarters, thanks in part to its 2015 takeover of DirecTV.Reynolds American (RAI) is also trading near a new 52-week high. The cigarette maker brandishes four consecutive quarters of accelerating sales growth. Earnings grew 9% on average over the past three years.The stock yields 3.2%, making it a nice dividend play.

Macy's said it is ""premature"" to provide more details, but according to Reuters it indicated during the conference call that it hopes to have executed some real estate transactions by year's end.The retailer had been facing pressure from activist investor Starboard Value to explore its real estate options.Fourth-quarter per-share earnings fell 14% to $2.09, excluding items, easily surpassing forecasts by 20 cents. But revenue fell more than 5% to $8.87 billion, just edging past views for $8.83 billion.Same-store sales on an owned-plus-licensed basis fell 4.3% during the quarter, a lower decline than expected.Macy's shares closed up 3% on the stock market today.""We are encouraged by the way the business responded going into 2016, and we believe we are well positioned to stabilize sales levels this year as we lay the foundation for enhanced shareholder value and sustained, long-term profitable growth,"" said CEO Terry Lundgren.

It sees a 2% total sales decline, due to the 40 store closings in 2015, below expectations for 2% growth in revenue.As more shoppers turn to lower-cost merchandise from off-pricers like Ross Stores (ROST) and TJX (TJX), Reuters reported that Macy's also laid out plans during the conference call to test out its off-price Backstage stores within approximately 15 Macy's locations this year.Retailers were faced with warmer-than-expected weather -- and as a result, piling inventory -- during the holiday quarter.

268,ROST,"Today's IBD 50 list includes four highly-rated retailers that have shown strength lately, while giants like Wal-Mart (WMT) have been losing ground.The world's largest retailer cut its full-year forecast Thursday and now sees sales coming in about flat, dashing hopes that recent initiatives would spark faster growth.Meanwhile, consumers continue to watch their budgets closely, and that's helping discount clothiers Ross Stores (ROST), Five Below (FIVE) and deep discounter Dollar General (DG) outperform the market.At the high end of the retail spectrum, shares of luxury clothing and accessories brand Michael Kors (KORS) popped 24% on Feb. 2 after it reported quarterly earnings and sales growth that easily beat Wall Street estimates.The chain is well positioned to weather the current market uncertainty and rising competition from online retailers such as Amazon.com (AMZN), Morningstar and others say.""They're one of the best"" traditional brick-and-mortar retailers, Morningstar analyst Bridget Weishaar told IBD recently, referring to Ross.Ross doesn't tout luxury brands or even have an online shop. But it's outperformed rivals in part by purchasing ""packaway"" inventory -- goods bought at a low price and packed away for months or years for later sale, no matter what the current fashions are.Shares have formed a deep first-stage base with a 56.78 buy point. Ross, which which will report fourth-quarter results on March 1, closed down 0.2% Friday.Teen apparel discount chain Five Below is expected to report robust holiday sales when it announces Q4 earnings next month. On Jan. 7, the company raised its guidance for the nine-week period ended Jan. 2.CEO Joel Anderson said at the time in a written statement that, ""given our holiday performance, we are raising our net sales outlook for the fourth quarter to a range of $323 million to $326 million and are narrowing our earnings per share guidance range to 75 cents to 76 cents.""That's up from Five Below's earlier outlook for EPS of 74-76 cents on $318 million-$323 million in revenue. Shares lost 0.2% Friday.Deep discount general merchandise retailer Dollar General has seen earnings and revenue growth fall off in recent quarters, though the company continues to show remarkable stability.That led Morgan Stanley to raise its rating on Dollar General on Feb. 16 from equal-weight to overweight.Its shares have a 93 IBD Composite Rating, meaning it's outperformed 93% of all stocks in recent quarters on key metrics such as sales and profit growth. Dollar General slipped 0.8% Friday.The outlier in the group, Michael Kors, is a leader in the luxury clothing, accessories and footwear category.In its Feb. 2 fiscal Q3 earnings announcement, Kors reported a 7.4% rise in EPS to $1.59 on a 6.2% increase in revenue to $1.397 billion. Both were an upside surprise to Wall Street.The company forecasts fiscal 2016 sales of $4.65 billion, easily topping analyst consensus for $4.42 billion.Chairman and CEO John Idol said in the earnings statement, ""As we look ahead, we are excited about our upcoming Spring collections that embody design innovation and underscore Michael Kors fashion leadership.""

269,ROST,"Stock indexes in the U.S. were mixed in early afternoon trade Friday as volume picked up from the previous session.The Nasdaq reversed from early losses to ante up a 0.4% gain. The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average were down 0.1% and 0.3%, respectively. Volume was running higher in the stock market today, which is normal on an options expirations day.Blue chips were mostly down. American Express (AXP) posted the best price gain in the Dow, up 1% as it headed toward a fifth up day in a row. Bloomberg News reported this week that the company plans to cut costs by $1 billion over the next two years.In the IBD 50, a list of the best stocks in fundamentals and technicals, the discount stores were hesitating. Ross Stores (ROST) and Dollar General (DG) each fell about 1% in above-average volume. Five Below (FIVE) was down moderately in slow trade.The discount stores are somewhat defensive. Aggressive growth investors would like to see those kind of retail stocks leave the computer-generated IBD 50 in favor of more aggressive plays. However, it isn't clear whether conservative stocks are ready to step aside for growth stocks.Many growth stocks are badly damaged. For example, analysts expect Under Armour (UA) to crank up earnings growth 25% this year and 28% next year. That would be an improvement over 2015's 11% earnings growth and a return to the five-year growth rate of 26%.However, Under Armour remains under its 200-day line and is 23% off its high.

273,ROST,"Several of the largest sector and industry ETFs have been mauled by the bear recently.Alerian MLP (AMLP) sits 45% below its 52-week high, putting it firmly in bear market territory. It invests in energy-focused master limited partnerships, typically midstream, pipeline companies.IShares Nasdaq Biotechnology (IBB) is trading 34% off its old high.Then there's Utilities Select Sector SPDR (XLU), a defensively oriented exchange traded fund.Think of it as your bear pepper spray for tough markets. It's worth considering an overweight to utility companies, especially since the broad-market ETF such as SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) that you may already own only has a 3% stake in the sector.XLU has gained 5.7% year to date through Feb. 17 vs. a 5.4% loss for SPY.So far in 2016, AMLP stumbled 18% and IBB tumbled 21%.Meanwhile, XLU hit a new 52-week high of 47 last week as the broad market was sinking. It has a Relative Strength Rating of 85, which means it is outgunning 85% of the stocks and ETFs in the IBD database.That momentum helped it earn a place on the elite IBD Leaderboard, becoming the first ETF to do so.Leaderboard holds stocks with stellar technical and fundamental factors, which offer investors the most potential for the biggest gains. Only three other stocks made that list Thursday -- AT&T (T), Ross Stores (ROST) and Reynolds American (RAI).XLU led these peers with a 2% gain on the stock market today. Along the way, it reclaimed a 46.24 buy point and formed a new handle area with a 47.10 entry. Shares are in a buy range.The $7.62 billion ETF last broke out of a base, on Oct. 24, 2014. Investors who jumped on that opportunity pocketed a 12% gain if they sold when XLU peaked at 49.78 three months later.Keep in mind that while breakouts from sound bases often lead to substantial gains, breakouts can fail. So among wise investors' sell rules are those that will help them cut any losses short.XLU offers broad exposure to 29 high-yielding utility companies in the S&P 500. As such, it has a large- and midcap skew.Top holdings include NextEra Energy (NEE), Duke Energy (DUK) and Southern Co. (SO)The utilities sector is one of the steadiest segments of the market.""This fund has been less volatile than the broader market because of the sector's generally stable cash flows and lower sensitivity to economic cycles,"" Robert Goldsborough, a Morningstar analyst, wrote in a recent report.However, the sector could get hurt if the Fed stays on track with its proposed four interest-rate hikes this year.""Higher rates generally make fixed-income instruments more attractive on a relative basis and make bond-like equities, such as utilities companies, less attractive,"" Goldsborough said.XLU has a 0.14% expense ratio and a 3.5% yield.It's the top-performing utility ETF year to date.

274,ROST,"The prospect of many oil-producing nations -- such as Saudi Arabia and Russia -- agreeing to oil production quotas buoyed the market for a second straight session. But would such a cap be a longer-term elixir for the market?While waiting for the answer to that $64 zillion macro question, investors like Tony Dong and Michael Gura, co-managers of $380 million Victory Munder Multi-Cap Fund (MNNAX), are navigating through the market's volatility while positioning themselves for better days.Limiting downside damage and getting off to a fast start in the next rally would help their fund return to the outperformance that it racked up in 2014, when the fund topped 94% of its large-cap growth peers tracked by Morningstar Inc.So far this year, going into Tuesday, the fund was down 12.26%, the same as its direct rivals' average and behind the S&P 500's 8.51% setback.To boost its prospects, the fund changed its name, dropping its old Growth Opportunities moniker, on Oct. 28. The fund also replaced its Russell 1000 Growth Index benchmark with the Russell 3000 Index.""The changes were made to better reflect the fund's ability to invest across market capitalization ranges, including large-, mid- and small-capitalization stocks, as well as its focus on a core growth style of investing,"" Victory Capital Management Chief Marketing Officer Caroline Churchill told IBD.Some of that intent, as well as an aim to cope with current volatility, is visible in changes to the portfolio's profile over a longer span, the 12 months ended Dec. 31. And some of those changes likely resulted from market action, not strategic shifts.The fund's tech weighting fell to 14.4%, down 12 percentage points. Its industrials weighting tumbled to 7.35%, down 5.7 percentage points.Tech and industrials tend to be sensitive to GDP growth, suggesting in part a pullback by the managers and in share prices in sectors that could be hurt more by a slowdown.Among individual holdings, the fund has several names that look like defensive plays for their durable revenues in a soft economy and for their dividends.Ross Stores (ROST), which has an IBD Composite Rating of 97 -- very strong on a scale that tops out at 99 -- is a discount apparel, accessories, footwear and home fashions chain poised to benefit if consumers get a firmer grip on their purse strings in a stingy economic environment.The stock gapped back up above its 10-week line on Tuesday after slipping below last week.

278,ROST,"The stock market is in a confirmed uptrend. But $41.5 billion T. Rowe Price Growth Stock (PRGFX) is still way off its late-2015 high (it's down 10.36% this year going into Tuesday), like a lot of growth-oriented mutual funds. So what's the fund doing to position itself for the future and to resume the outperformance charted by helmsman Joe Fath since he took the tiller a little more than two years ago?After becoming manager in early 2014 and then reshaping the portfolio to reflect his strategy, Fath guided the fund to a 10.85% gain in 2015. That topped 96% of its large-cap growth rival mutual funds tracked by Morningstar Inc. Its peer group averaged a 3.60% gain. The S&P 500 edged up 1.38%.It will be increasingly hard to find growth in 2016, Fath said in his year-end commentary. Durable growers will be crucial to good performance. And he wants to use market volatility to find good growers whose price gets knocked too low -- relative to their long-term prospects.Eight of his top-10 holdings as of Dec. 31 have strong Composite Ratings from IBD of 80 or higher.He's already seeing gains out of names like Ross Stores (ROST). The apparel, accessories, footwear and home-fashions discounter is up 5% since its Jan. 20 low.

281,ROST,"The bigger the debt, the harder it is for borrowers to dig out of the hole. The same often holds true for companies too.""Rule 1 for all competent investors and homeowners is never ever borrow more than you can pay back. Excessive debt hurts all people, companies and governments,"" IBD founder and Chairman William O'Neil wrote in ""How to Make Money in Stocks.""IBD uses the long-term debt-to-equity (LTD-to-E) ratio to determine if a company is showing too much borrowing risk. The ratio is simply a company's long-term debt divided by shareholders equity, multiplied by 100 to get a percentage figure.A ratio of 100% or more implies that a firm is borrowing at an aggressive pace to fuel its expansion. It could also indicate a company is overreaching and not growing in a disciplined manner. By the same token, if a company's LTD-to-E ratio is falling year to year, it might be worth a second look. ""A corporation that's been reducing its debt as a percentage of equity over the last two or three years is worth considering,"" O'Neil wrote. ""If nothing else, interest costs will be sharply reduced, helping to generate higher earnings for share.""So when comparing two stock candidates for purchase, assuming they are in the same industry and all else being equal, pick the company with the smaller LTD-to-E ratio.Some industries require heavy spending to grow, so it may be natural for companies in those industries to borrow heavily. Firms in the telecom, heavy construction, and oil and gas exploration fields tend to carry heavier debt. Yet in other industries, the best-run companies may carry zero long-term debt. So be sure not to compare stocks from different industries. Do an apples-to-apples comparison.A company may take on debt for various uses. For instance, a business that is growing via acquisitions may need cash to fund those purchases, with the idea that the buys will help it expand going forward. Or a telecom company wants to build more towers to reach its ultimate goal of growing its subscriber base.In a study of the greatest stock market winners, IBD found that many of them didn't have much debt.The accompanying table shows current leaders with outstanding EPS and RS ratings, priced at least $20 a share, and an average daily volume of at least 1 million shares. Facebook (FB), New Oriental Education (EDU), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Ross Stores (ROST), show zero to low single-digit debt ratios.Constellation Brands (STZ), Extra Space Storage (EXR), Hawaiian Holdings (HA) and Verizon Communications (VZ) occupy the higher end. Beer and wine maker Constellation has made a number of acquisitions over the past few years and is planning to expand its Nava brewery in northeast Mexico. Verizon has been spending on wireless spectrum space to build out its wireless network.Companies can finance future investments in new products, services or plants and equipment by issuing new shares as well. This too can dilute shareholder value in the long run.

323,ROST,"Ross Stores (ROST) lost some ground in the stock market today, despite topping Q1 sales and profit views late Thursday.
"
324,ROST,"Will it stop the highly rated off-price retail operator's business from staying on the growth path?
"
325,ROST,"Analysts see the company's strong value proposition continuing to resonate with bargain-hungry shoppers, and Ross is highly rated by IBD.
"
326,ROST,"Ross stock slid in afternoon trading on Friday, closing down more than 4%. Shares of rival off-price discount operator TJX Cos. (TJX) were down slightly as were shares of giant discounters Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) and Target (TGT).
"
327,ROST,"Why was Ross stock down after a Q1 beat? The reason is tied to its earnings forecast for Q2, which was below analysts' views, according to various reports:
"
328,ROST,"Ross is being ""somewhat cautious regarding 2Q given the macroeconomic environment, the likelihood of an increased promotional environment and the company's difficult comparison after years of solid results, says Stifel Nicolaus about the off-price retailer's below-consensus current-quarter forecast,"" a Dow Jones & Co. wire report stated.
"
329,ROST,"Ultimately, the investment bank sees the guidance being ""likely a case of underpromise, overdeliver,"" it added.

"
332,ROST,"Comments in reports following Q1 results suggest Ross' business is seen remaining strong.
"
333,ROST,"Why?
"
334,ROST," 1. Ross' value proposition should continue to play well with consumers.
"
335,ROST,"In a report reviewing recent retail Q1 reports, Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics, noted that Ross Stores turned in an ""impressive quarter,"" beating earnings expectations and posting same-store sales ahead of views on higher traffic and a higher average ticket.
"
336,ROST,"""Ross joined TJX, which reported a 5.0% comp earlier this week, in highlighting the strength of the off-price segment,"" Perkins noted. ""With most of the lower and middle income groups feeling squeezed economically over the past six years they remain a tremendous value proposition for the majority of American consumers.""
"
337,ROST,"Ross, he added, has not turned in a decline in same-store sales since the fourth quarter of 2008.
"
338,ROST," 2. The company's strong track record is seen continuing amid healthy off-price retail trends.
"
339,ROST,"Nomura analyst Robert Drbul was also impressed with Ross' Q1 results, he said in a report following Thursday's results.
"
340,ROST,"Because of the ""significant beat"" in Q1, he raised his 2015 earnings per share estimate for Ross to $4.87 from $4.80.
"
341,ROST,"""Given Ross Stores' impressive (results) ... on the back of the 5% comp increase at TJX announced earlier in the week, we believe that the momentum in off-price is far from over and that this channel will continue to grow share at the expense of other retail formats.""
"
342,ROST,"Ross, he added, is one of the ""leading players"" in the off-price industry, offering brand name apparel and accessories for 20%—60% off full-price retail.
"
343,ROST,"Drbul believes the company should continue to benefit from ""very positive secular dynamics"" through its exposure to the ""favorable"" off-price channel.
"
344,ROST,"He noted over the past eight years, revenue in the off-price channel has grown at a faster rate than national apparel sales, and Ross has only posted a negative annual same-store three times since 1989.
"
345,ROST,"""We view the off-price channel favorably because it can thrive in both strong and weak consumer environments, benefiting from 'trade down' when the consumer is under pressure,"" Drbul noted.
"
346,ROST," 3. Ross is ready to flex its muscles against new rivals.
"
347,ROST,"Cowen and Co. analyst Oliver Chen was also upbeat on Ross' prospects in a report out Friday. He was impressed with management's comments regarding new entrants into the off-price retail market, including Macy's (M) which will open pilot locations of its off-price store concept, Macy's Backstage, in the fall.
"
348,ROST,"Management believes it has ""the strong skill set"" to compete with new entrants into the off-price category, Chen noted.
"
349,ROST,"""We were encouraged to hear management's) perspective that new entrants will more likely expand the total pie of the off-price segment at the expense of other retail formats, rather than take share from off-price incumbents (TJX, ROST),"" said Chen in the report.Ross Stores (ROST) lost some ground in the stock market today, despite topping Q1 sales and profit views late Thursday.Will it stop the highly rated off-price retail operator's business from staying on the growth path?Analysts see the company's strong value proposition continuing to resonate with bargain-hungry shoppers, and Ross is highly rated by IBD.Ross stock slid in afternoon trading on Friday, closing down more than 4%.

350,ROST,"The subscriber-only Stock Checkup tool at Investors.com is one of the premier validation tools available to investors. Why? You can quickly see if the stock passes muster from a fundamental and technical perspective.The ""A"" in the CAN SLIM acronym stands for ""annual earnings."" While strong quarterly earnings growth is good to see when evaluating a stock, a steady track record of annual earnings growth is also important.It’s easy to get a handle on a stock’s annual earnings with Stock Checkup. Scroll down a bit to the Fundamental Performance area. In the Annual Earnings area, a company’s three-year EPS growth rate is shown. Curious how many consecutive years of annual earnings growth a company has? You’ll find that here too. Finally, the annual earnings estimate for the company’s current fiscal year is shown.A green dot next to the number means the company passes muster. A yellow dot is neutral, and a red dot is a fail.A general rule of thumb is to look for firms with an annual earnings growth rates of 20%. In a study between 1980 and 2000, the median annual growth rate of all outstanding stocks at their early emerging stage was 36%.In the large-cap space, several top-rated names in IBD’s database will have sub-20% growth rates, but don’t automatically dismiss them if they pass muster in all other fundamental areas. An annual earnings growth rate of 10%-15%, for example, is quite respectable for a large cap.When it comes to consecutive years of annual earnings growth, look for firms showing at least two to three years of growth. IBD 50 name Ross Stores (ROST) shows eight straight years of annual earnings growth stretching back to 2007. The same goes for NetEase (NTES).When it comes to a company’s annual earnings estimate for the current fiscal year, 20% is a very good benchmark for a high-growth name. You may accept a smaller growth rate for mature large-cap companies.SmartSelect Ratings are shown at the top of Stock Checkup. Annual earnings are factored into the calculation for the Earnings Per Share (EPS) and Sales+Profit Margins+Return on Equity (SMR) ratings.In the EPS Rating, a company’s annual earnings are looked at alongside recent quarterly profits. In the SMR Rating, return on equity helps separate well-managed firms from poorly managed ones. It is derived by dividing annual net income by average shareholders' equity over the past two years.

351,ROST,"A Day 5 follow-through in both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq on Tuesday gives IBD readers the proverbial ""green light"" to deploy capital in fresh new leaders.Question is, how bright is that ""green light?""Indeed, every IBD-style growth investor should know these two things: 1) not all follow-throughs are the same; and 2) the success and breadth of the breakouts by high-quality stocks ultimately determine the quality of a follow-through.Right off the bat, this new uptrend is hampered by a much smaller pool of stocks that are towering in both EPS and sales growth as well as price strength. The small list of stocks making Inside Your Weekly Review reflects this clearly.Nevertheless, the market's rally can heat up. Spring always follows winter. In 2016, watch to see if a comeback in crude oil prices, better-than-expected fourth-quarter results, or other positive external events help provide a spark.Keep a close eye on how this Weekly Review list changes. Does it grow in size in weeks to come? If yes, that's positive.In the Jan. 22 edition, just 36 names made the stringent screen. Only companies scoring an 85 for both EPS Rating and RS Rating and trading within 15% of their 52-week highs make the cut. The Jan. 15 list showed 37 stocks.A quick scan of today's YWR shows that quite a few different industry sectors get represented, but only by a handful of stocks or less. These companies are true leaders in their specific industry niches.You won't find many stocks hailing from the medical sector in today's list, but Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) (90 EPS, 89 RS) made the grade. It's fallen in recent days, but still trades not so far from a 580 high that it hit in a recent breakout. No one has yet come up with a better system of robotic surgery.Ross Stores (ROST) truly excels in buying excess inventory from department store chains and selling the merchandise at deep discount in a clean, well-lit atmosphere. The stock is not far from a 55.74 handle buy point. Fiserv (FISV), O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY) and Public Storage (PSA) also are tops in their fields.

352,ROST,"The $11.2 billion MFS Growth Fund (MFEGX) is looking seaworthy these days.The large-cap growth portfolio outperformed 96% of its peers tracked by Morningstar Inc. (MORN) over the turbulent past three months by losing less than its rivals did on average. It also topped the S&P 500, losing 4.85% vs. the benchmark's 6.22% setback.And the fund ranked in the top 6% and 11% of its peer group over the past 12 months and 10 years. Co-manager Eric Fischman has been at the helm since April 2002. He was joined by Matthew Sabel in April 2014.“We are long-term focused,” Sabel told IBD last summer. “We’ve held many of our names a long time ... . We may make some cyclical bets, but we really focus on secular growth stories.”Facebook (FB) was a top holding as of Dec. 31. The stock was up as much as 2% in early trading Tuesday, posting a new high before reversing to a 1% loss on the day as the market sold off. It cleared a 110.75 buy point Friday.On Jan. 6, Facebook put its Oculus Rift virtual-reality headset on sale. On Jan. 25, SunTrust Robinson Humphrey maintained its buy rating on the stock, but cut its price target to 120 from 125. On Jan. 27, Facebook reported Q4 adjusted earnings per share of 79 cents, up 46%, topping analysts' consensus estimate for 68 cents. It was the second straight quarter of accelerating EPS growth.Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), which is on IBD's Leaderboard, opened lower Tuesday but is holding above a 260.28 buy point of a double-bottom base, which it cleared Friday.The stock is well within buy range, only 2% above its entry. Volume has been coming in strong, a positive sign as the stock makes new highs.
"
353,ROST,"ICE benefits from volatile markets like the current one because its exchanges feature derivatives that many investors buy and sell to offset market gyration risks. Earnings are due Thursday before the open. Q4 EPS is seen rising 16% to $3.01 a share.Ross Stores (ROST) also slipped early Tuesday, but it is still in a buy range, less than 2% past a 55.74 cup-with-handle buy point, which it cleared on Friday in slightly above-average volume. Volume accelerated on Monday.Ross Stores is the biggest U.S. discount apparel chain. The stock held up better than most in the market's recent pullback. The retailer's three-year profit growth rate is 12%. EPS for fiscal Q3 rose 13%, beating Wall Street estimates. The company reiterated its fiscal Q4 guidance, but said it faces challenges due to ""uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment.""Starbucks (SBUX) stayed above its 50-day moving average early Tuesday after gapping above the line Friday in heavy volume.For now, the stock is working on a flat base with a 64.10 buy point. Signs of institutional support at the 200-day line emerged on Jan. 20 when the stock closed in the upper half of its intraday range in heavy volume after a soft start.The specialty coffee retailer runs roughly 23,000 stores in 70 countries. CEO Howard Schultz recently told the Wall Street Journal that the chain plans to open 500 stores annually over the next five years in China. Schultz thinks China could become his largest market.On Jan. 21, Starbucks reported that fiscal Q1 EPS rose 15% to 46 cents on a 12% sales increase to $5.37 billion. Views were for 45 cents on $5.39 billion.

354,ROST,"It doesn't have an online shop. It doesn't promise luxury brands. And its fluorescent lighting and long, uninterrupted racks of merchandise aim in no way to replicate the glossy feel of a Bloomingdale's or Macy's.But Ross Stores (ROST) is widely considered a solid, if not particularly flashy, find as other retailers struggle against the Web tide, and as shoppers increasingly take their business to off-price channels.""They are so well positioned. They’re one of the best,"" Morningstar analyst Bridget Weishaar said of Ross, adding that the off-price industry overall has hit the ""sweet spot of pricing and distribution.""Ross is also a safe bet in this  increasingly hostile world for retailers, where online giants like Amazon (AMZN) are swallowing market share away from conventional brick-and-mortar stores by the plateful.The realities of the modern retail landscape reflect a consumer base that is increasingly drawn by Amazon's gravitational pull and the appeal of ordering things online. Last summer, Cowen had predicted that Amazon would topple Macy's (M) as America's No. 1 apparel retailer by 2017.""In 2016, we believe investors can't ignore Amazon, the growing giant in the retail world,"" Cowen & Co. analyst Oliver Chen said in a recent note to clients. ""We suggest buying companies who can offer an 'un-Amazon-able' brand proposition.""Ross appears to have done just that. It is included in that brief list of companies impervious to Amazon's market-share grab, along with off-price retail rival TJX (TJX), upscale furniture retailer Restoration Hardware (RH), Victoria's Secret parent L Brands (LB) and beauty-product vendors Sally Beauty Holdings (SBH) and Ulta (ULTA).The distinction is notable for this unassuming chain of off-price stores, since the rest of the retail field has been working hard to fend off the creeping advance of e-commerce.Macy's has turned each and every store into a mini-fulfillment center in order to expedite online shipping orders. Nordstrom (JWN), known for its tech spending, has set aside $1.5 billion, or 35% of its $4.3 billion five-year capital plan, for tech and supply chain investments.Even TJX has an e-commerce presence, though it remains a relatively small one. In general, selling items online isn't easy for off-pricers that have a revolving door of merchandise.""Such a potpourri is not necessarily conducive to traditional online (shops),"" said Cowen's Chen.Visitors to Ross's website won't see any online offers, and no way to peruse its inventory outside of a physical store. Could its lack of an e-commerce segment hurt the company down the road?""I don’t think it’s a big issue right now,"" said William Blair analyst Daniel Hofkin. ""Could it become a big issue over time? Sure, it could. At this time, they don’t feel it could be profitable.""An online shop would bring greater access to shoppers.""I think it merits exploration because the reality is, with the prevalent use of mobile phones, it’d be nice for them to tap into that device that everybody has,"" said Chen. But with a selection of mostly low-ticket items, ""the main issue is shipping costs.""Hofkin highlighted one benefit that TJX has seen from its online efforts; it is reaping incremental traffic from customers who stop by stores to make returns and wind up picking up a few things while they're there. That happens about 70% of the time, he said.But shoppers are likely to want to visit Ross stores in person, even stopping by brick-and-mortar locations as often as once a week, said Chen.""It’s about the treasure hunt -- that isn’t something that you can replicate online,"" he said.Ross also retains other advantages.Unseasonably warm weather late last year prompted an inventory pileup for many stores, which in turn prompted heavy discounting as cold-weather gear didn't leave shelves as quickly as hoped. Other retailers' inventory management was ""appalling"" last year and over the holiday season, said Morningstar's Weishaar.But Ross is not expected to shoulder the same burden from winter's toasty start as its department-store brethren -- in fact, weather woes for other companies can translate to cheap buys for off-pricers, which often source from overstocked suppliers.""(It can) allow (Ross) and TJX to buy some excess merchandise in the marketplace at substantially better prices, which can support future sales and margins,"" William Blair's Hofkin said via email. ""(Ross) also likely has less weather exposure, given its larger (California) and sunbelt presence.""Between 20%-25% of Ross Stores are located in California, he said.Analysts also highlight Ross's buying strategy. The company purchases a lot of ""packaway"" inventory, i.e. basics that can be bought at a low price now but then sold seasons later, regardless of what's in fashion.While high inventory levels aren't generally regarded as a positive for most retailers, Ross' 48% packaway level doesn't trouble Wall Street. Morgan Stanley's Kimberly Greenberger called it a ""strategic advantage"" and wrote in November that packaway ""typically provides (Ross) customers with the greatest value and produces the highest merchandise margin, enhancing financial returns.""How does Ross rate against its primary rival, TJX, the parent of T.J. Maxx, Home Goods and Marshalls? Both are broadly well-regarded. Both have been outperforming their retail peers.The TJX customers, though, tend to come from from a wider range of household incomes, and they generally spend more per visit than the average Ross customer. TJX products also have higher price points. T.J. Maxx, for example, stocks a selection of high-end items more in line with what one might find at Saks Fifth Avenue, including $600 Versace watches and Fendi purses that go for a ""discounted"" price that is still nearly $3,000.Ross also is a domestic play. As of the end of its most recent quarter, the company had 1,276 Ross Dress for Less locations in 34 states, the District of Columbia and Guam, plus 172 DD's Discounts across 15 states. Conversely, TJX operates stores in Canada, Europe and most recently Australia, with its 2015 acquisition of Trade Secret.Ross shares are up roughly 13% over the last 12 months, in stark contrast to its broader category, IBD's Retail-Apparel/Shoes/Accessories industry group, which has fallen 16%.Ross's third-quarter earnings for the period ended Oct. 31 grew 13% to 53 cents a share, topping views by three cents. Revenue growth of 7% to $2.78 billion pulled ahead of forecasts for $2.77 billion.Management is ""solid as a rock,"" said Cowen's Chen. ""I think they have good strategies that are balanced.""What kind of speed bumps could Ross encounter in the future?Wage increases could put pressure on margins, noted several analysts. But the minimum wage hike in California -- which is now $10 an hour as of the start of 2016 -- could also help Ross, said Chen, as the lower-income shopper now has more money in his or her pocket.And deeper discounts at Macy's and other department stores could also lure in bargain hunters as competition for shoppers heats up.Ross declined to provide comment for the story. Its executives generally do not grant media interviews, said a Ross spokesperson.""There’s a certain degree of privacy because in the industry you don’t want to reveal too much to your competitors,"" said Chen, ""and because there’s competition for goods and competition for how you should change your store to capture share.""
"
355,ROST,"A combination of the ""reverse wealth effect,"" U.S. political uncertainty, a strong dollar and a challenged China market led Cowen & Co. to downgrade luxury retailers Tiffany & Co. (TIF), Restoration Hardware (RH) and Swiss-based Compagnie Financiere Richemont.""We see risk the reverse wealth effect will slow high-end consumer spending in 2016 due to the S&P 500's negative start to the year (-6% YTD) and -1% return in 2015 after 3 straight years of (positive double-digit) gains,"" wrote Cowen's Oliver Chen. Plus, increased talk about raising taxes for the wealthy during the election cycle could curb high-end spending.Chen also said that the stronger U.S. dollar should continue to hit foreign tourism spending; he cited concern ""for the ripple effects to global luxury spending"" as a result of the economic slowdown in China.Cowen downgraded Tiffany to market perform and cut its price target to 70 from 75, on ""near-term caution that volatile tourism flows and global macro challenges will not be offset by TIF's improved & innovative product."" However, he noted that he still had faith in Tiffany's global long-term story.Restoration Hardware also received a downgrade to market perform ""on risk to 2016 estimates from a slowdown in high-end consumer spending, continuing promo pressure indicating a more challenged environment & likely lack of valuation upside."" The upscale furniture seller also discounted aggressively in December and January. Chen said that the company still has ""significant runway,"" however.""In our view, the biggest source of risk to 2016 could likely come from slowing revenue as the affluent consumer pulls back on home spending due to the reverse wealth effect, political uncertainty with the US presidential election, and late-cycle housing recovery,"" he wrote.Another downgrade to market perform was handed to Richemont, the parent company of Cartier, Montblanc, Piaget and other luxury brands, on exposure to Hong Kong, the U.S. and ""weakness in watches."" Richemont trades on the SIX Swiss Exchange.""We continue to prefer stocks positioned to benefit from a healthier low-end consumer in '16,"" wrote Chen.Last month, he upgraded off-price retailer Ross Stores (ROST) to outperform from market perform, calling it a ""prudent retail holding in 2016"" and an ""un-Amazonable"" retail stock. Amazon (AMZN) continues to present a challenge to many traditional brick-and-mortar retailers as they try to adapt to the shift to online and omnichannel shopping.Tiffany shares closed up 1.4%. Restoration Hardware shares fell 3.5%. Respective rivals Signet Jewelers (SIG) rose 4% while Williams-Sonoma (WSM) ended flat. Amazon lost 2.1%, extending losses after tumbling 7.6% on Friday on a big earnings miss.

That makes Campbell and Ross…
"
357,ROST,"Warmer weather, online shopping and heavy discounting have made retail a tough space to be in right now, but at least five stocks on the IBD 50 list are bucking the trends.Ulta Beauty (ULTA) has held off Amazon (AMZN) better than its retail peers, partly because of the experiential nature of buying beauty products and partly because of the dedicated customer loyalty that companies like Ulta and Sephora have built, according to analysts.Notably, specialty beauty retailers have the benefit of not being in a seasonal industry, say experts, which means that they are not subject to the promotional pressures that department stores and clothing retailers face.Ulta, a member of IBD's Retail-Specialty industry group, has risen 35% over the last year. The group has collectively lost 6%.Nike (NKE) and Under Armour (UA) have also fared well amid a struggling retail backdrop as ""athleisure"" continues to make its way out of the gym and into offices and even major fashion houses.Health and wellness trends -- think juice bars, cleanses and the much-anticipated SoulCycle (SCYL) IPO -- have worked in both companies' favor, and Under Armour's push into wearable technology has inserted itself into the tech conversation alongside Fitbit (FIT) and the Apple (AAPL) Watch.Nike's stock has climbed 31% and Under Armour has grown 17% since Jan. 29, 2015. Shares of the Apparel-Shoes and Relating Manufacturing group and Apparel-Clothing Manufacturing have risen 5% and declined 15%, respectively.Both companies are not the only two activewear companies on the list. Foot Locker (FL), which carries both Nike and Under Armour in its stores, also made the cut.Starbucks (SBUX), for its part, isn't afraid of a slowdown in China. The java giant is expanding assertively into the country, with a goal of operating 3,400 stores there by 2019.Starbucks missed Q1 revenue and guided Q2 below consensus estimates when it reported on Jan. 21, but CEO Howard Schultz expressed enthusiasm about bringing Starbucks' mobile-order-and-pay feature to Chinese consumers. He anticipates that it will be a ""runaway success.""Domestically, its mobile efforts have yielded success, with over a fifth of all U.S. transactions now made via smartphone.Starbucks shares have grown 36% while IBD's Retail-Restaurants group has tumbled 15%.Ross Stores (ROST) doesn't even have an e-commerce presence, but the chain of off-price stores has been labeled ""un-Amazonable"" by Cowen analyst Oliver Chen, citing the appeal of the ""treasure hunt"" experience that compels shoppers to visit brick-and-mortar stores.Amid a shift to off-price retailers, analysts agree that there's room for square-footage growth as Ross expands into other regions stateside.Ross Stores' stock has risen 20% over the last year, compared to the Retail-Apparel/Shoes/Accessories group, which has declined 14%.A number of other consumer stocks abound on the IBD 50 list, including energy-drink maker Monster Beverage (MNST), discounters Five Below (FIVE) and Dollar General (DG), and baby-clothing merchant Carter's (CRI).RELATED:Why Under Armour’s Market Share May Be Bigger Than You ThinkThink We’re In A Recession?

366,ROST,"When the economy is entering a recession, stocks in consumer staples, health care and telecoms ""are the best places to hide,"" said Barclays' Jonathan Glionna, who names tobacco giants Philip Morris International (PM) and Reynolds American (RAI) and drug giants Merck (MRK) and Pfizer (PFE).Meanwhile, he includes General Electric (GE) among the stocks to buy for a recovery.He doesn't see a recession in the near term, but there are red flags such as the collapse of oil prices, the 10% retreat in the S&P 500 so far this year and slowing growth in global No. 2 economy China.In a report Monday, Glionna joined a growing number of analysts providing lists of recession-resistant stocks. But he took a slightly different tack from others, offering two lists: a Recession Playbook and a Recovery Playbook.Among other top picks on his Recession Playbook are Campbell Soup (CPB), Coca-Cola (KO), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Procter & Gamble (PG) and Hormel Foods (HRL).Philip Morris stock closed up 0.3% Tuesday, and Reynolds American, the maker of Camel cigarettes, added 1.3%. Merck gained 0.7%, and Pfizer rose 1.9%. Campbell Soup climbed 1.7%, while Johnson & Johnson and Procter & Gamble ended flat.Glionna said of his Recovery Playbook: ""The best performing sectors in previous periods of economic recovery -- using the exit of a recession as indicative of a recovery -- have been energy, materials, industrials and consumer discretionary.""Among stocks on that list: Ford Motor (F), General Electric, General Motors (GM), Harley-Davidson (HOG) and Viacom (VIA).Ford ended down 2%, and GM lost 2.8% Tuesday. GE ticked up 0.4%. Harley-Davidson fell 1.5%, and Viacom plunged more than 21% on worse-than-expected results for the December-ended quarter.Meanwhile, Cowen analysts put out their own list of recession stocks Tuesday, saying, ""We believe stocks that appeal to the low-end consumer and have minimal global exposure appear well-suited to weather an economic downturn.""Among their top picks: off-price clothing retailer Ross Stores (ROST) and Wal-Mart Stores (WMT).Ross Stores climbed 2.25%, and Wal-Mart fell 1.6%.

377,ROST,"Black Friday. Cyber Monday. Super Saturday. The annual retail running of the bulls is a treacherous terrain of sharpened elbows and trigger-happy mouse clicks for shoppers trying to get the best deal possible.The stakes are even higher for the stores themselves: The National Retail Federation has said that sales in November and December can account for anywhere from 20%-40% of a retailer's yearly sales. Perhaps fortunately for department stores like Macy's (M), Kohl's (KSS) and others, there's nowhere to go but up this Christmas.""Given the fact that last year was so horrible, the comps are easy,"" said Morningstar analyst Bridget Weishaar.As weather, inventory issues, heavy discounting and e-commerce giants like Amazon (AMZN) weighed, Macy's reported a 4.7% same-store sales decline in November and December of last year. Kohl's Q4 2015 comps edged up a mere 0.4%. Overall, last year's holiday retail sales disappointed with only 3% growth, said the NRF, less than expected.Holiday 2016 should prove to be a little less dire. The NRF predicts a 3.6% retail gain in November and December to $655.8 billion; online sales are seen rising 7%-10% to $117 billion. And retailers are feeling bullish. Target (TGT), Macy's and Nordstrom (JWN) all raised guidance going into the all-important shopping season.Predictably, online sales continue to eat into brick-and-mortar market share. Traditional stores are again gearing up to do battle with Amazon and friends.Wal-Mart (WMT) is pushing up its ""Cyber Week"" deals from Monday to Friday so that they start essentially the minute Thanksgiving Day is over. Target's ""10 Days of Deals,"" which include both in-store and online promotions, already started on Saturday.""If you look at the companies that reported earnings, it's e-commerce that's driving a significant amount of the growth,"" said Weishaar. ""What's unique in it is mobile is becoming a higher penetration of the digital section, so that would be something new. I don't think a lot of the companies have figured out how to convert the sales on mobile.""Shopping via smartphone is the next frontier. Thanksgiving Day and Christmas are projected to be the biggest mobile-shopping days of the year, said Adobe.One consequence of a ramp-up in retail digital wars, however, is that fewer people head into brick-and-mortar shops.Retail Metrics head Ken Perkins says the industry could see a ""significant slowdown"" in Black Friday foot traffic.Traffic fell in the mid-single to high-single-digits on Black Friday 2015, and retailers could see an equal or even greater decline this time around, he said, particularly as other shopping events during the year dilute the impact of the post-Thanksgiving sales day.Besides Cyber Monday and Super Saturday, the menu of existing shopping holidays has grown to include Amazon's Prime Day and even China-based Singles Day, among others.Foursquare's data are a little more optimistic; the company predicts a 3.5% year-over-year slide in Black Friday foot traffic, which would be ""far less severe"" than the prior year's figures.""The importance of Black Friday from a traffic (perspective) to brick-and-mortar stores is going to continue to decelerate,"" said Weishaar. ""With more people shopping online, the one specific day becomes less important.""IBD'S TAKE: Adobe data indicate that Black Friday sales will be the ""biggest ever,"" growing 11.3% from last year to $3.05 billion in sales. For a look at what else is happening this week, check out IBD's Investing Action Plan. Broadly speaking, inventory levels are cleaner in Q4, which translates to more targeted, strategic discounting instead of promotional wars, said Weishaar. But even in the absence of ""everything must go""-type sales, that doesn't mean that consumers shouldn't expect to see a whole lot of deals floating around.Which retail names will be winners this year?Instinet analyst Simeon Siegel pointed out in a recent note that execs at various retailers have alluded to a challenging, promotional holiday season. But there are gems to be found.""Although the election triggered a surprising sense of hope (and short squeezes), we believe much uncertainty remains and would rather buy quality companies that have lagged,"" he wrote, calling out Ulta Beauty (ULTA) as his top pick and noting that the recent Lululemon Athletica (LULU), HBI and Kate Spade (KATE) sell-offs look ""interesting.""Still shining is the off-price sector, as consumers remain hesitant about paying full retail for products and stores have a tough time escaping the ""always-on-sale"" cycle. Athletic wear also continues to dominate street fashion.Nike (NKE), TJX (TJX) and Ross Stores (ROST) remain Siegel's long-term choices.Holiday shoppers, unconcerned about the fate of retail stores, will continue to like what they like.Millennials, who favor experiences over tangible goods, may not be retailers' favorite customers. But PwC research found that the teen set, Generation Z, likes ""stuff — and shopping in stores.""""To them, stuff matters,"" said the report. ""Stuff like personal electronics, clothes, shoes, and toys. Which is what they're hoping to receive this holiday season.""RELATED:Black Friday Is The New Cyber Monday: Wal-Mart Pushes Up Sale

408,ROST,"With stocks on track for their worst January since at least 2009, breakouts have been few and far between. But for a stock to break out, it has to form a base first.Here’s a look at five IBD 50 stocks that are building bases: Facebook (FB), Starbucks (SBUX), Ulta Beauty (ULTA), Foot Locker (FL) and Edwards Lifesciences (EW).Facebook earns a highest-possible IBD Composite Rating of 99. The social networking giant reports quarterly earnings after the close on Wednesday.Shares are trading about 12% below a consolidation buy point of 110.75. Last week, shares were able to find support at the key 200-day line. Facebook rose 0.3% on Tuesday.Starbucks, which has a 96 Composite Rating, also found support at the 200-day line last week. Shares are trading 8% below a 64.10 buy point. Starbucks rose 1.6% Tuesday.Last Thursday, the coffee giant beat quarterly earnings expectations but missed revenue views and issued weak guidance. Still, Starbucks says it’s bullish on its expansion in China.Ulta Beauty reported better-than-expected quarterly results in early December. The beauty products retailer has a 97 Composite Rating.Ulta stock is building a flat base with a 188.58 buy point and is trading 5% below the pivot. Shares are looking to retake the 50-day line in Tuesday’s session. Ulta rose 2%, above its 50-day.Foot Locker is trying to retake its 200-day line, but looks to be hitting resistance there. Shares are trading 14% below a consolidation buy point. They're up 2.6% today.The shoe retailer has a 93 Composite Rating.Edwards Lifesciences has a 94 Composite Rating. When the heart valve maker issues its quarterly results next week, earnings are projected to have risen 17%.Shares were able to retake the 50-day moving average just a few sessions after finding support at the 200-day line. The stock is now just 3% below an 83.53 flat-base buy point. But the stock fell 4 cents to 80.16.O’Reilly Automotive (ORLY), Ross Stores (ROST) and Campbell Soup (CPB) are among other IBD 50 members working on bases.While breakouts provide buying opportunities, the current market environment warrants a cautious outlook.

409,ROST,"Major averages faded badly and were near session lows in late-afternoon trading Monday, held hostage by the oil market once again.Stocks started to bleed around the time that oil started its descent. The Nasdaq fell 0.1%, a far cry from an early 1.7% intraday gain. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial fell by the same amount.Volume on the NYSE was tracking slightly higher than Monday's levels in the stock market today. Nasdaq volume was lower.In economic news, the latest data from the IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index showed that Americans are still modestly pessimistic about the economy.Once again, oil- and gas-related groups were among the worst performers as oil reversed lower. Benchmark WTI crude oil was down 3.5% to $30.30 a barrel.Among the day's gainers, Chuy's (CHUY) broke out in heavy volume, rising 5%. It's still in a buy range from a 35.86 buy point, but the market hasn't been kind to technical breakouts in recent weeks. Chuy's is also on the speculative side, with an average daily dollar volume of around $10 million.Stamps.com (STMP) gained nearly 4%. After an orderly pullback, it's finding support at its 10-week moving average for the first time after gapping out of a base in November.Solid performers in the Nasdaq 100 included Starbucks (SBUX). Shares rose nearly 2% on news that the company plans to open 500 new stores in China every year for the next five years. Also in the Nasdaq 100, Ross Stores (ROST) was off session highs but still rose around 2%. It's just below a 55.74 handle buy point. The retailer is also an IBD 50 component.Nasdaq 100 bellwethers Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Facebook (FB) benefited from positive comments from Credit Suisse earlier in the session but, just like the broad market, gave back early gains.On the downside, Alcoa (AA) cratered 9.5%. Late Monday, it reported adjusted earnings of 4 cents a share, better than expected, but sales came up short amid plunging aluminum prices and China's economic woes.Connect with Ken Shreve on Twitter: @IBD_KShreve and on Facebook.

414,ROST,"Techs joined the Trump rally while banks, defense and some of last week's other big winners held their gains. Fed chief Janet Yellen expects a rate hike ""soon,"" while OPEC output talks revived and Warren Buffett booked a flight on airline stocks. Retail results and outlooks were mixed heading into Black Friday.The Nasdaq rose 1.6% for the week, briefly hitting an all-time intraday high Friday, as big-cap techs such as Apple (AAPL) and Alphabet (GOOGL) recouped some losses. The Dow industrials, after the prior week's postelection spike to a record high, rose just a fraction. The S&P 500 rose 0.8%, also close to record highs. Bank stocks moved sideways or higher as Treasury yields dipped initially but then rose again. Some fiber-optic, chip and cybersecurity stocks broke out.Fed chief Janet Yellen said that a rate hike would be ""appropriate relatively soon."" She stressed the risks of delaying a move but also didn't sound like the central bank would follow up with a series of tightening steps. Yellen said she intends to serve out her term through January 2018, despite criticism from President-elect Trump during the campaign. Meanwhile, economic data were strong. Jobless claims tumbled to a 43-year low, housing starts spiked to a nine-year high and retail sales were robust heading into the key holiday shopping season. Consumer inflation hit a 2-year high, though it remains relatively low.RELATED:Fed's Yellen: Rate Hike 'Soon,' Will Serve Full TermTech unicorn Snap, owner of the popular short-duration photo and video site Snapchat, reportedly filed for a confidential IPO. Snap declined to comment and the SEC, as the name implies, keeps such filings, for the time being secret. But it's widely reported that Snap will go public early in 2017 and will be looking for a gaudy valuation of roughly $25 billion. Alibaba (BABA), Yahoo (YHOO) and some of the big VC firms are among those that have invested more than $1 billion in the company, a rival to Facebook (FB), Facebook's Instagram, Twitter (TWTR) and other social media sites. It's the first of the really big unicorns — startups valued at $1 billion-plus — to reportedly file for an IPO.

421,ROST,"After the Great Recession, as declining equity prices pulled the stock market down, dividends became a bigger part of total returns. That enabled dividend stock mutual funds to outperform the S&P 500 for the first part of the past 10 years.But the ongoing bull market — which is more than six and a half years old — has given growth stocks and mutual funds that focus on them a new head of steam.Growth stocks in the form of the S&P 500 have generally outperformed dividend stock funds since early 2012.And their success has enabled them to post a better average annual return than dividend funds over the entire past 10 years.The S&P 500 has notched a 7.04% yearly average gain over the decade, going into Monday.The index's current 12-month dividend yield is 2.18%, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices.Dividend funds tracked by Morningstar Inc. have gained an average of 5.65% a year for their investors in that decade.Their 12-month dividend yield is 2.05%.If you had invested $10,000 in a typical dividend mutual fund on Sept. 30, 2005, it would have grown to $17,471 by Dec. 11 of this year.It would have blossomed into $20,327 in the S&P 500 over the same period.A small number of those funds specialize in stocks with rising dividends or that aim to boost their dividends.Among those, the $746 million Ave Maria Rising Dividend Fund has the top average annual return over the decade. Its average yearly gain is 7.98%.But in this volatile year, when the S&P 500 is down 0.27%, Ave Maria has slid 7.06%.It now has a dividend yield of 1.26%.Among its top holdings is Lowe's (LOW), which has an IBD Composite Rating of 97.The Composite Rating combines IBD's five stock-performance ratings, including Earnings Per Share and Relative Strength Ratings, with 99 being the highest.The stock, whose dividend yield is 1.5%, is up 9% this year. Its earnings per share rose 13%, 15% and 36% the past three quarters.Ross Stores (ROST), also an Ave Maria holding, has a Comp Rating of 89.The discount retail chain's stock is up 14% this year.

Maxx, Home Goods and Marshalls, logged better-than-expected same-store sales growth of 5%, up from 2% in the same period last year, led by robust customer traffic that has eluded other chains.""It has consistently been one of the best performing retailers since the Great Recession taking advantage of consumers' increasing desire to maximize every dollar by selling top national brands at significantly discounted prices,"" wrote Ken Perkins on Tuesday.Earnings notched up over 1% to 86 cents per share, 2 cents above forecasts. Revenue rose over 5% to $7.75 billion, topping views for $7.73 billion.TJX shares gapped up 3.9% to 68.18 in the stock market today.""We are delighted that strong customer traffic drove our entire consolidated comp and was the primary driver of our comp increases at every division,"" said CEO Carol Meyrowitz in a statement. ""Our excellent traffic gains and strong performance across our apparel, accessories and home categories, demonstrate that our brands globally are offering the right values and merchandise mix.""Traffic continues to be up in the current quarter, she said, asserting confidence that TJX will grow to a ""$40 billion-plus"" company.But guidance for the crucial holiday quarter and for fiscal 2016 fell short of expectations, as the company accounted for foreign exchange rates, pension costs, TJX's wage initiative and its $57 million acquisition of Australian off-price retailer Trade Secret, among other items, which all weighed on EPS growth by 9%.For Q4, management expects 2%-3% comp growth and 91-93 cents in diluted per-share earnings, vs. analysts' 98 cents per share.For the year, TJX expects 4%-5% in same-store sales growth and $3.26-$3.28 diluted per-share earnings, below consensus estimates for $3.32 a share.Off-price retailers are seen continuing to outperform, according to RBC Capital Markets analyst Brian Tunick, who two weeks ago outlined his reasoning for the sector's growth potential.Meanwhile,Wal-Mart (WMT), which also reported Tuesday, logged its fifth consecutive quarter of positive U.S. same-store sales but Q3 results were mixed.Target (TGT) and Ross Stores (ROST) also report this week.Wal-Mart shares were up 3.5%.

"
486,ROST,"Strong quarterly results from Wal-Mart and TJX helped ease concerns Tuesday that U.S. consumers are in full retreat, though they continue to shy away from clothes shopping and hunt for the best deals.
"
487,ROST,"TJX (TJX) topped estimates and raised its guidance going into the all-important holiday quarter, and the off-price retailer doesn't appear to be burdened by the same inventory and pricing issues that plague full-price peers.In contrast to Macy's (M) and Nordstrom's (JWN) weak results and forecasts last week, TJX lifted its full-year same-store sales growth estimate to 4%-5% from a prior outlook for 3%-4% growth. Q3 earnings edged up over 1% to 86 cents per share, topping by 2 cents, and revenue grew over 5% to $7.75 billion, vs. views for $7.73 billion.""It's a broader reflection of core middle- and lower-income consumers, which makes up 70% of the population,"" Retail Metrics' Ken Perkins told IBD. ""They are looking for value.""TJX shares climbed 3.85%, and Wal-Mart gained 3.5%.Fourth-quarter and full-year guidance fell short of expectations, however, as the company accounted for a variety of factors — including its late October acquisition of Australian off-pricer Trade Secret — that should weigh on EPS growth by 9%.Meanwhile, Wal-Mart (WMT) saw a 14% drop in Q3 EPS to 99 cents, topping by a penny. Revenue dipped 1.3% to $117.4 billion, missing views, but U.S. comps grew for the fifth straight quarter amid turnaround efforts.Shift In Spending HabitsA ""healthy U.S. consumer backdrop,"" cleaner stores and upgraded staffing, among other factors, will likely drive holiday demand at Wal-Mart, noted Cowen & Co.'s Oliver Chen, who has a market perform rating on the stock.But Wal-Mart still faces competition from Amazon (AMZN), said Perkins, and the big-box retailer is also feeling the heat from dollar stores like Dollar General (DG) and Dollar Tree (DLTR).Weighing on traditional retailers and department stores is a shift in spending habits. Perkins pointed to off-pricers' post-recession success as a reason why Macy's, Nordstrom and other companies are pursuing the discount space themselves, with offshoots like Macy's Backstage, Nordstrom Rack and Saks Off Fifth, among others.And in an increasingly cutthroat shopping environment that pits brick-and-mortar shops against Amazon and other online shopping destinations, the battle is being fought on several fronts.But shoppers also aren't as interested in apparel, say both Perkins and Morningstar analyst Bridget Weishaar. Those dollars are going into a variety of different areas, including home goods and bigger-ticket items such as automotive needs.Outside of cheaper products, another advantage that off-pricers like TJX and Ross Stores (ROST) have is faster and higher inventory turnover, giving it a flexibility that makes it more akin to fast-fashion favorites Forever 21 and Zara than Macy's or Nordstrom.""The ones that are outperforming right now are the ones that are most responsive to what consumers want,"" Weishaar said.Traditional retailers have a six- to nine-month lead time for orders, she explained, while off-pricers can buy merchandise much closer to the start of each season. This helps to ""weatherproof"" against factors such as, say, a warmer fall that keeps shoppers enjoying the changing foliage instead of shopping for snow boots.When asked about the impact of warm weather — which several other retailers have blamed in recent earnings reports — TJX CEO Carol Meyrowitz said that she'd ""rather not talk about weather,"" focusing instead on her team's performance.""That's all about execution and delivering the right product to the right stores at the right time,"" she said on the post-earnings call. ""Every year, we learn and we get better at weatherproofing our business. It just comes back to the model — we keep ourselves very flexible.""For department stores, improving lead time is easier said than done, said Perkins. ""It's like trying to turn around a battleship.""The good news for shoppers, at least, is that Santa's likely to deliver plenty of discounts for the holidays.Perkins said he expects the promotional environment to be ""comparable, if not even steeper"" and potentially more aggressive than last year's holiday quarter, as retailers try to get rid of leftover inventory from the fall.Weishaar was even less optimistic: ""It's going to be horrible. It's going to be one of the worst we've seen in a long time.""
"
488,ROST,"Never mind ""Let It Snow."" Heading into the crucial holiday shopping season, retailers are more likely singing ""Let It Go"" from the movie ""Frozen"" as they try to shake off disappointing quarterly earnings results and a bad week that collectively sank merchant stocks.Nordstrom (JWN), Macy 's (M), J.C. Penney Co. (JCP) and Kohl's (KSS) were among those that reported the week of Nov. 9, with Nordstrom and Macy's turning in weak results and discounted forecasts, and J.C. Penney and Kohl's shares falling despite beating consensus views.An October retail sales data miss — a worse-than-expected 0.1% gain — didn't help either, though Amazon (AMZN) and other e-commerce sellers notably logged a 7.1% rise from the previous year as consumers continue to do much of their shopping online. Cowen & Co. predicted in July that Amazon would knock out Macy's as the top U.S. apparel retailer by 2017.Even much-lauded off-pricers haven't been immune to the pummeling that retail stocks were subjected to over the past week. Shares of TJX (TJX), the parent company of T.J. Maxx, Marshalls and HomeGoods, lost 12% over the past week.In a possible sign of things to come, Q3 same-store sales at Nordstrom's off-price arm, Nordstrom Rack, fell 2.2%.""This type of miss from Rack is surprising to us, and we acknowledge the Rack's off-price slowdown could be a negative indicator for TJX,"" wrote Cowen & Co. analyst Oliver Chen on Friday.But he added that TJX, which reports Tuesday, could ""offset some secular weakness"" based on a few factors, including the strength of the company's sourcing and buying teams, home goods offerings and international reach.The company is expected to report a slight earnings dip of 1% to 84 cents a share. That would mark the third straight quarter of earnings deceleration and a swing from earnings gains of 7%, 8% and 15% in the three preceding periods.Revenue is seen rising 5% to $7.73 million, which also would reflect a slowdown.With a 75 IBD Composite Rating, TJX is the highest ranking member of IBD's Retail-Apparel/Shoes/Accessories group, which ranks a feeble 144 out of 197 groups.Peers in the group include Ross Stores, Foot Locker (FL), L Brands (LB) and American Eagle Outfitters (AEO).Fellow off-pricer Ross Stores (ROST) gapped down ahead of its Thursday earnings release, losing 11% for the week. Analysts expect over 6% EPS growth to 50 cents on 6% sales growth to $2.77 billion.And what about the big-box retailers?Target's (TGT) earnings are seen accelerating, with a predicted 59% climb to 86 cents a share on a 1% revenue dip to $17.57 billion. Shares retreated 6.9% last week.And Wall Street expects Wal-Mart (WMT) earnings to slide 15% to 98 cents a share on a 1% revenue decline to $117.79 billion. Shares slid 4%.""We believe retail is in a state of transition as brands wrestle with how to compete against growing & dynamic pureplay online retailers,"" wrote Chen.RELATED:Retail Sales Weak, Except For Amazon, EcommerceMacy's Stock Selloff Could Be Tip Of Iceberg4 Reasons TJX, Off-Price Retailers Will Keep Surging.

540,ROST,"The U.S. economy added 156,000 jobs in September, coming in modestly below expectations of 168,000, the Labor Department said Friday. The jobless rate rose to 5.0%.The 151,000 job gain initially reported in August was revised up to 167,000, but the prior month was revised down by 23,000 (from 275,000 to 252,000).The report is unlikely to shift the Federal Reserve's December timetable for hiking its key interest rate. A hike in November — just before the election — is seen as doubtful. But markets have been on edge lately about the possibility of faster-than-expected hikes in 2017, with the 10-year Treasury yield closing at a four-month high on Thursday.Do You Use An Online Broker? Now's the chance to tell how well your needs are met. IBD's annual investor survey on brokers' performance is underway. Click to take the survey now. Stocks opened modestly higher but closed lower with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq both losing 0.3%.Average hourly earnings rose 0.2% from September and 2.6% from a year ago, just off the 2.7% cycle high for hourly wage growth marked in July.In recent months, companies have been raising wages and talking about rising, if still moderate, wage pressures. JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Starbucks (SBUX) and Wal-Mart (WMT) have hiked their minimum wage. Wendy's (WEN), Ross Stores (ROST), Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) and others have said they're paying more as they compete for top talent, incentivize performance and keep up with minimum wage laws.The workweek ticked higher to 34.4 hours after sinking over the summer, suggesting a bit less slack in the labor force than indicated by the August report. Along the same lines, the household survey showed that 444,000 people entered the workforce last month, increasing the participation rate to 62.9%. The rise in the jobless rate, up from 4.9% in recent months, came because more people joined the workforce than reported having jobs, even though the latter number grew by 354,000.IBD'S TAKE: How can you tell if a jobs report is too hot, too cold, or just right? Markets may react negatively or positively on the day of the report, but the key for investors is to stay abreast of the market's prevailing trend. Visit IBD University for a primer on how to time the stock market and read The Big Picture column every day.A weaker-than-expected report isn't likely to trouble the Fed, since most policymakers think that the U.S. is close to full employment — the point at which job gains only need to match the net additions to the workforce, or else wage and inflation pressures will intensify.John Williams, president of the San Francisco Federal Reserve, laid out that case that monthly job gains should slow back in August: ""The current pace of job gains is well above what we need, which I put to be somewhere around 80,000 a month, although estimates range from 50,000 to around 100,000.""Williams added: ""We should expect the pace of job gains to slow, and no one should be alarmed when it does.""With two more jobs reports after this one before the Fed meets Dec. 13 and 14, some economists are saying that it would take three weak reports in a row to derail a year-end hike.RELATED:The Goldilocks Economy Is Shrinking When It Comes To Jobs

"
543,ROST,"Wall Street economists expect Friday's jobs report to show that the economy added 180,000 jobs in August as the jobless rate dipped to 4.8%.That would be a solid gain, but not likely strong enough to prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates at its September meeting, especially after Thursday's surprisingly weak ISM manufacturing index.Other details also will be key: What happened to the workweek, which averaged 34.5 hours in the latest report? Did wage growth rise from July's 2.6% annual rate?If anything, wage growth is likely to surprise on the upside. Since the start of July, JPMorgan Chase (JPM) tellers and Starbucks (SBUX) baristas got a significant bump in pay, while Wendy's (WEN), Ross Stores (ROST), Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) and others have said in corporate earnings calls that they're paying more as they compete for top talent, incentivize performance and keep up with minimum-wage laws. While these are anecdotal reports, federal taxes withheld from paychecks, the broadest gauge of the health of the job market, are growing at the fastest rate in nine months.So what would it take to prompt the Fed to action later this month, instead of waiting until December for the next hike, as markets currently expect?""It will have to be a real blockbuster to trip a September move,"" says Dan North, chief economist at trade credit insurer Euler Hermes North America.What qualifies as a blockbuster? In North's view, that might mean 250,000 new jobs, ""plus strong wage growth, increased hours, increased participation.""Wages, hours and participation all provide a signal as to how much slack remains in the labor market. If those elements of the report signal weakness, North figures an addition of 290,000 jobs in August would be needed to provoke the Fed to act at its next meeting.IBD'S TAKE: With wage growth picking up, investors may want to focus on companies with a strong enough position in their markets to withstand labor inflation without suffering a hit to profit margins. Read this Investor's Corner on studying profit margins and check out IBD Stock Checkup to see how your stocks rate.Some Fed policymakers have said that the economy is close to full employment. At that point, the theory suggests, employment growth that exceeds growth in the labor force will increase upward pressure on wages.In a report this week, Wells Fargo Chief Economist John Silvia and colleagues estimated that any job growth above 95,000 per month now reduces labor market slack. That's lower than it's been because of the slower growth of the potential labor force as baby boomers retire.""A slowdown (in job creation) may very well be needed to avoid overheating and cause the Fed to tighten policy faster than expected,"" the Wells Fargo team wrote.
"
544,ROST,"August's 151,000 job gain missed expectations and slowed from July. But the headline figure still looks decent, or even better for Wall Street because it means the Federal Reserve can take its time before raising interest rates.Yet a look below the surface reveals something entirely different: This was the worst jobs report since 2010.If the data are accurate, the economy is in much worse shape than commonly believed. Yet before going into the ugly details, consider some contrary signals:Since the start of July, JPMorgan Chase (JPM) tellers and Starbucks (SBUX) baristas got a significant bump in pay, while Wendy's (WEN), Ross Stores (ROST), Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) and others have said in earnings calls that they're paying more as they compete for top talent, incentivize performance and keep up with minimum-wage laws. While these are anecdotal reports, federal taxes withheld from paychecks, the broadest gauge of the health of the job market, are growing at the fastest rate in nine months.Now here's what's wrong with the latest jobs report. The problem isn't primarily that job growth has decelerated, it's that wage gains also slowed and the average workweek is now shorter than at any time since the economy was still getting back on its feet in 2011 (unless you count two blizzard-hit months in the winter of 2013-14 when the workweek was equally short).IBD'S TAKE: Despite what the jobs report says, wages have been trending higher, and that's likely to continue as the economy nears full employment. Investors may want to focus on companies with a strong enough position in their markets to withstand labor inflation without suffering a hit to profit margins. Read this Investor's Corner on profit margins and check out IBD Stock Checkup to see how your investments rate.The most important number in each report isn't the net number of new jobs. It's a number that combines the total number of jobs in the economy, the length of the workweek and the average hourly wage. Here's the shock: Aggregate weekly payrolls, essentially the sum total of private-sector pay earned in a week, grew just 3.5% from a year ago in August, the weakest gain since September 2010. (The 3.5% gain matched the level seen in that unusually stormy December of 2013.)The biggest culprit was the length of the average workweek, which was revised down in July from 34.5 hours to 34.4 hours, then fell to 34.3 hours in August. Here's what that means when combined with the modest deceleration in job creation: The total number of hours worked in the economy rose just 1.1% from a year ago, the smallest increase since July 2010. By comparison, total hours worked have grown at least 2.3% vs. a year ago in each of the past five years' August jobs reports.Meanwhile, after average hourly wages grew just 0.1% in August, the annual rate of increase slowed from an upwardly revised 2.7% in July to just 2.4% last month.Despite the added jobs, the paltry wage growth last month and the drop in hours meant that aggregate pay fell 0.2% in August from July.The bottom line is that, if these details reflect reality, the purchasing power of American consumers has gotten pinched. That could help explain why fast-food chains like McDonald's (MCD) have seen sales growth slow, while retailers like Target (TGT) saw a decline in same-store sales. It's also possible that companies facing margin pressures amid tough competition and higher wages have curtailed work hours.Still, the Labor Department data are subject to revision, unlike the tax data that are signaling a faster rise in aggregate pay, so it doesn't make sense to jump to negative conclusions.RELATED:Slower August Job Growth Will Keep The Fed On Hold In SeptemberAs Companies Step Up Wage Hikes, Tax Receipts Get A Lift

545,ROST,"Did department stores Macy's (M) and Nordstrom (JWN) move their earnings out of the doldrums and back onto the growth track in the third quarter?Investors will learn the answer when the two top department stores kick off retail earnings season and report quarterly results this week. If analysts' expectations are on target, both companies will see their earnings decrease.So far, the signs aren't good, analysts say. The department store group saw their shares get hammered on Monday as several negative reports came out on the segment.Macy's shares tumbled after Citigroup lowered its price target on the retailer. Deutsche Bank also issued a negative report on Macy's and other mid-tier department store operators Kohl's (KSS) and Dillard's (DDS), noting they ""may be about to limbo underneath what is already a very low bar as they report potentially very underwhelming Q3 results and Q4/holiday guidance.""Macy's shares closed down 5.4% on the stock market today.JPMorgan also issued a negative report on several department stores on Monday noting Macy's, Dillard's, Kohl's and Nordstrom have ""too much cold-weather inventory,"" among other things. Nordstrom shares closed down 4.7% on Monday.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Macy's to see earnings decline 13% from a year earlier to 53 cents a share when it reports third-quarter results on Wednesday before the opening bell. That comes on top of a 20% drop in the second quarter.They see a 1.6% decline in sales to $6.1 billion, following a 3% decrease in the second quarter, to mark the third straight quarter of year-over-year earnings declines.Macy's is generally regarded as a well-run chain, with a strong sales channels, but it has reported lower year-over-year revenue in five of the last seven quarters.The sales trend comes as spending has been shifting from traditional shopping-mall department stores and apparel chains toward experiences and non-tangible goods such as wireless services and entertainment, amid ever-growing competition from Amazon (AMZN) and other online players.Investor's Business Daily's department store industry group ranks retailers No. 192 out of 197 industry groups.Macy's has recently undertaken a number of initiatives to propel growth, including entering the lucrative off-price retail arena, where it would compete with operators such as TJX Cos. (TJX) and Ross Stores (ROST). In September, Macy's debuted its new off-price retail brand, Macy's Backstage, with three New York City metro area stores and three more set to open in 2015.Nordstrom is also generally regarded as a well-run chain with a strong omnichannel presence. The company has fared particularly well with its growing chain of Nordstrom Rack off-price stores.Nordstrom is expected to see earnings slip 0.7% vs. a year earlier to 72 cents a share when the high-end department store operator reports third-quarter results on Thursday after the close. That would follow a 2% decline in adjusted earnings in the second quarter and mark the fourth-straight quarterly drop in earnings.Analysts expect the upscale department store operator to see a 7.4% rise in revenue to $3.4 billion. That would follow a 9% gain in sales in the second quarter.On Oct. 1, Nordstrom announced that it closed the sale of its credit card portfolio to TD Bank USA for $2.2 billion. The agreement also makes TD Bank the exclusive U.S. issuer of Nordstrom-branded Visa and private-label consumer credit cards.In connection with the closing, Nordstrom's board authorized a special cash dividend and an additional $1 billion share repurchase program. The company said it would pay a special cash dividend of $4.85 a share on Oct. 27, to shareholders of record on Oct. 12.Follow Marilyn Much on Twitter @IBD_MMuch.

561,ROST,"Off-price retailers such as TJX (TJX) and Ross Stores (ROST) have been among the brightest spots in retailing during recent years, and the sector should continue to outperform in the foreseeable future.
"
562,ROST,"That was the conclusion of analyst Brian Tunick of RBC Capital Markets in a detailed report that put TJX and Burlington Stores (BURL) at the top of his most favored list of off-price retailers, with outperform ratings.
"
563,ROST,"The top four off-price retailers — TJX, Ross Stores, Burlington Stores and Nordstrom's (JWN) Nordstrom Rack, which touts more stores than its traditional department-store counterpart — collectively gained 9% market share from midtier department stores and $12 billion of added sales since 2008, he noted, while their operating margins surpassed those of department stores.
"
564,ROST,"Among the reasons why he thinks share gains can continue:
"
565,ROST,"1. Off-price still holds only 15% of domestic apparel sales, so the stores have room for more gains.
"
566,ROST,"2. Off-price has come a long way from its ""bottom fishing"" days, when stores carried many overruns, end-of-season merchandise and damaged goods. Merchandise is fresher and more fashion forward, and includes a number of upscale brands featured in department stores, Tunick noted.
"
567,ROST,"3. Off-price retailers are actively targeting millennials with digital marketing tools, including Facebook (FB) photo-sharing site Instagram.
"
568,ROST,"4. TJX is becoming a ""meaningful global retailer,"" Tunick added, citing store expansion plans outside the U.S. that could help push the company's total revenue above $40 billion in five years. Revenue is expected to hit a little more than $30 billion this fiscal year, ending in January.
"
569,ROST,"But off-price retailers will face increasing competition from department stores fighting back with off-price concepts of their own. Macy's (M), for one, is opening ""Backstage"" stores.

617,ROST,"Burlington Stores (BURL) easily topped second quarter estimates, driving its shares up Thursday to an all-time high.The off-price women's, men's and children's apparel retailer reported a 105% increase in Q2 earnings per share minus one-time items to 39 cents on a 10% hike in revenue to $1.26 billion. Analyst consensus was for 30 cents EPS and $1.24 billion sales.Sames-store sales grew 5.4% and gross profit margin improved 40 basis points to 39.6%. Burlington Stores also took advantage of favorable interest rates to re-price a major loan at a lower rate.""We believe we are well positioned for the fall season,"" CEO Tom Kingsbury said in a written statement.For Q3, Burlington expects adjusted EPS of 30-32 cents, just below forecasts for 33 cents. The company expects sales to climb 7.1%-8.1%, implying $1.318 billion, roughly in line with views for $1.317 billion. It sees sales at comparable stores rising 2.5%-3.5% in Q3.Burlington shares closed 3.1% higher at 80.85 the stock market today, after hitting a record 83.41 intraday. The stock has soared from a May 18 low of 51.19 after EPS growth over the last three quarters rose from 3% to 39% and 105% last quarter.IBD'S TAKE: Burlington Stores stock has risen more than 50% in three months and it's extended above buy range. But several quality stocks are near buy points, including two retailers. To find that list, as well as stocks actually breaking out, take a trial of IBD's Marketsmith.Burlington joined ""Dress for Less"" apparel retailer Ross Stores (ROST), which reported strong earnings on Aug. 18. Ross Stores hit a record high on Aug. 19 but has drifted lower this week, including a 0.7% loss Thursday.But their off-price peer TJX (TJX), which operates T.J. Maxx, Marshalls and other brands, reported a disappointing outlook for both Q3 and the full year with its Q2 results on Aug. 16. Shares fell below their 50-day line and are still trading above or below that key level. TJX edged up 0.3% Thursday.More broadly, deep discount variety stores Dollar Tree (DLTR) and Dollar General (DG) both missed forecasts Thursday. Dollar Tree slid 9.9% and Dollar General plunged 17.6%.Among big-box discount giants, Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) reported solid results as earnings dipped a penny from last year but topped estimates.

"
618,ROST,"Shares of TJX (TJX) -- the parent of off-price stores T.J. Maxx, Marshalls and HomeGoods -- tumbled Tuesday on disappointing guidance for both the third quarter and full year, but at least one analyst believes the Street is being entirely too dramatic about the light outlook.The company upped its 2017 outlook to $3.39-$3.43 in per-share earnings vs. prior targets for $3.35-$3.42, and raised full-year same-store sales guidance to 3%-4%, up from 2%-3%.That still missed current Wall Street estimates for $3.48 in earnings per share, and current-quarter guidance for 83-85 cents a share is well short of consensus for 90 cents in the third quarter.Analysts nevertheless sound positive on the stock.""We would be aggressive buyers on overblown weakness,"" wrote Cowen analyst Oliver Chen, who sees continuing momentum in the second half of the year ""on better weather (and) plentiful inventory in channel."" He rates TJX an outperform.Likewise, RBC Capital Markets analyst Brian Tunick wrote prior to TJX's conference call that despite below-model guidance, ""we believe the company is guiding appropriately conservatively given the commentary that Q3 is off to a strong start.""Outlook notwithstanding, TJX turned in a solid second quarter, with 84 cents in earnings per share, up 5%, on 7% revenue growth to $7.88 billion.Analysts had expected 81 cents earnings per share on $7.85 billion in sales.Total same-store sales grew 4%. Chief Executive Ernie Herrman sounded bullish in prepared remarks, and said that third-quarter comps were ""almost entirely driven by customer traffic,"" and that its apparel and home businesses ""performed well.""RBC's Tunick said that TJX's second-quarter results ""speak to continuing profitable share gains."" He is neutral on the stock.TJX gapped down 5.8% at the close to 77.97 on the stock market today, falling below a 79.26 buy point cleared last monthIBD'S TAKE: The off-price sector has generally outperformed brick-and-mortar retailers, and shares of TJX closed Monday still firmly in buy territory after breaking out of a flat base with 79.26 entry in mid-July.

619,ROST,"JPMorgan Chase (JPM) tellers, Starbucks (SBUX) baristas and Wal-Mart (WMT) cashiers have all received a significant bump up in pay in recent months, and the latest round of earnings calls from Corporate America shows that they have plenty of company.In recent weeks, Wendy's (WEN), Ross Stores (ROST), Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) and others have said they're paying more as they compete for top talent, incentivize performance and keep up with minimum wage laws.The broad upward pressure on wages is still fairly modest, but it appears to be picking up, based on the latest Treasury data on federal income and employment taxes withheld from paychecks. In the past four weeks through Aug. 19, withheld taxes rose 4.7% from a year earlier, the fastest pace since the start of November.The data, which are roughly consistent with 2% growth in aggregate hours worked and 2.7% higher wages, still don't qualify as robust. By comparison, withheld taxes rose about 5.5% from a year earlier during the first half of 2015, and growth exceeded 7% for most of 2006.Yet the upward trend is worth watching, both because it could signal stronger consumer activity and because it could shift the Federal Reserve's view of the economy and the interest-rate outlook.IBD'S TAKE: With wage growth picking up, investors may want to focus on companies with a strong enough position in their markets to withstand labor inflation without suffering a hit to profit margins. Read this Investor's Corner on profit margins.Still, a continued acceleration in income growth isn't a sure thing. After weak productivity gains in recent years, companies are doing their best to do more with less by driving efficiencies, from managing inventory better at Wal-Mart to adopting self-pay kiosks at some Wendy's franchises.Here's what companies have been saying about labor costs:RELATED:Wal-Mart CEO: Sam's Club Shoppers Can Skip CashierFast Food Prices Have Never Risen So Fast Vs.

In this box, you'll see two funds highlighted.These will be two of the market's 40 best funds, as determined by ownership of market leaders, highest average Composite Ratings and performance relative to the S&P 500.In the week of Aug. 22, IBD showcased two funds with excellent long-term performance: American Century Growth Investors (TWCGX) and Fidelity Contrafund (FCNTX).

See anything interesting?You'll find Ross Stores (ROST), which has since more than tripled after a breakout in mid-October of 2011. Ametek (AME), a maker of motors, power meters and transducers, was still within buying range from its recent push from a cup with handle before going on a long, steady run through the next two years. Since late 2015, Ametek has been in base-building mode, consolidating its big gains.Cosmetics name Estee Lauder (EL) also appeared within the top 10 holdings of the Columbia Mid Cap Growth Fund, also featured on the same day. The stock went on to build a number of bases amid a slow yet steady rally.As you scan through these top funds' holdings, you might feel vindicated by seeing names you may already have identified.

622,ROST,"Stocks continue to grind sideways, while the latest run of retail earnings, including Home Depot (HD) and Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) didn't offer much clarity on consumers. Cisco Systems (CSCO) offered job cuts and a weak outlook. But Chinese internet stocks continue to deliver robust earnings, while oil made a strong advance.The major averages moved sideways, closing little changed. The Nasdaq rose 0.1%, grinding out its eighth straight weekly gain. The S&P 500 fell less than one point and the Dow lost 0.1%. Several Federal Reserve officials made hawkish hints, insisting a September hike was in play. While markets doubt that, the comments did have an effect. Energy stocks were strong as oil prices rallied. Retailers generally rose, led by Wal-Mart and Ross Stores (ROST), though TJX Cos. (TJX) was among the losers. Cisco Systems cut jobs and its outlook. Tencent (TCEHY) led a slew of  top-rated China internet stocks reporting earnings.Brent crude futures, the international benchmark, rose above $50 a barrel. Meanwhile, U.S. crude prices shot up 9.1% for the week to $48.52 a barrel. Buzz about a new push for an oil production freeze among OPEC and large non-OPEC producers helped lift prices. But Saudi Arabia is raising production to meet domestic demand, and Iran hasn't made a decision on joining the informal freeze talks in September.Meanwhile, U.S. crude stockpiles fell for the first time in four weeks, with gasoline supplies also down. But U.S. production rose. The number of U.S. oil rigs in operation rose for an eighth straight week to a six-month high.Cisco Systems said it will slash 5,500 jobs, or 7% of its workforce, as it continues to shift from hardware to software and services. Cisco topped fiscal Q4 views while sales edged higher. But Cisco's current-quarter EPS and revenue targets were below forecasts. Cisco stock on Monday had its highest close since late 2007, but it went on to fall 1.1% for the week.IBD'S TAKE: While Cisco revenue barely rises, fiber-optic component makers are booming amid strong demand from telecoms, internet giants and China. Acacia Communications shares have skyrocketed since their May IPO. Learn what Acacia CEO Raj Shanmugaraj has to say about the so-called fiber optic ""super cycle"" in a recent IBD interview.Wal-Mart earned $1.07 a share, a penny below a year earlier but beating views. Revenue increased slightly as U.S. same-store rose again and e-commerce growth picked up. The brick-and-mortar retail giant emphasized digital marketing after buying Jet.com this month for $3.3 billion, as it tries to fend off Amazon (AMZN), Alibaba (BABA) and other online retailers.Rival discounter Target (TGT) beat profit views, but sales fell short as Apple (AAPL) product sales fell 20%. Target cut full-year EPS guidance, citing a ""challenging environment"" in the back half of the year.Wal-Mart shares hit a 14-month high on Thursday, but closed the week down 1.5%, back below the 50-day line, while Target lost 7.5%.IBD'S TAKE: Investors should focus on the true leaders.

But Home Depot raised its full-year EPS view as it still benefits from a housing ""tailwind."" Meanwhile, smaller rival Lowe's (LOW) missed on the top and bottom lines.

Its U.S. shares rose 8.3%, hitting fresh highs.NetEase reported revenue of $1.47 billion, up 96% in local currency year over year, as EPS rose 91% to $3.67. NetEase stock hit a high early in the week, but it fell Thursday after the results. It rose 1.9% for the week.China is now the world's largest online game market, but NetEase and Tencent have opportunities to expand further. China has the world's largest internet user population, at 686 million, yet the market is still estimated to be only about half penetrated, vs. roughly 90% for the U.S.In the previous week, Alibaba and JD.com, China's two largest e-commerce retailers, both posted double-digit growth in revenue and earnings that topped estimates.Some youth-oriented apparel chains reported strong results.Children's Place (PLCE) posted a smaller-than-expected loss and a slim revenue gain. Children's Place also raised its full-year EPS outlook to $4.60-$4.70 from an earlier outlook of $4.17-$4.27. Shares rose 4.4%, hitting a record high.American Eagle Outfitters (AEO) delivered a 35% quarterly EPS jump, while sales' 3% gain edged past views. Same-store sales rose just 3% though.

The conference saw a record 6,000 in attendance and featured news that Intel is partnering with longtime rival ARM Holdings (ARMH) to make some of its mobile and Internet of Things chips.The Justice Department said it would phase out its use of privately run prisons, arguing that the government is better equipped for the job. Private prisons ""do not provide the same level of correctional services, programs and resources; they do not save substantially on costs ... they do not maintain the same level of safety and security,"" Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates said in a memo. GEO Group (GEO) plunged nearly 40% on Thursday, and Corrections Corp. of America (CXW) 35%, both hitting multiyear lows.Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS), Foot Locker (FL) and Hibbett Sports (HIBB) all beat quarterly earnings views, though Hibbett's sales fell short.

"
625,ROST,"Retailers will have to keep prices low and the online offers flowing. As shoppers guard their wallets, could this situation mean further gains for off-price stores like Nordstrom (JWN) Rack and TJX's (TJX) T.J. Maxx and Marshalls?

"
627,ROST,"The group expects November and December sales to grow 3.7% to $630.5 billion, a slowdown from last year's 4.1% growth, though higher than the 10-year average of 2.5%.
"

"
634,ROST,"Separately, off-price retailers should continue to grab market share from the full-price sector, ""given the secular preference of consumers,"" said Sourcing Journal founder Edward Hertzman, according to a Cowen & Co. report from Wednesday.
"
635,ROST,"Cowen's report says, ""Rather than gain share from one another, Hertzman sees continued growth at the various segments of off-price: a) high-end off-price stores incl. Saks OFF 5th and (Nordstrom) Rack, b) larger-scale incumbents where brands are key like (TJX's) T. J. Maxx (and) Marshall's, and c) price-conscious budget off-price stores incl. Ross (ROST) and Burlington (BURL) Coat Factory.""
"
636,ROST,"While Nordstrom is not exclusively an off-pricer, Rack has proven to be complementary to the main business, leading 1 million Rack shoppers back to the full-line or online Nordstrom store. Rack brought in 4 million new shoppers in 2014.

With the economy on their minds, he expects families to spend ""prudently and deliberately.""The group expects November and December sales to grow 3.7% to $630.5 billion, a slowdown from last year's 4.1% growth, though higher than the 10-year average of 2.5%.""Price, value and even timing will all play a role in how, when, where and why people shop over the holiday season,"" said Shay. ""Retailers will be competitive not only on price but on digital initiatives, store hours, product offerings and much more.""E-commerce sales are seen rising 6%-8% to as much as $105 billion, says the NRF.Brick Retailers Fire Mortar At AmazonBrick-and-mortar retailers have long been vying with the likes of Amazon (AMZN) and other retailers in the digital shopping space. Target (TGT) expanded its price-match policy to Target.com merchandise, starting last week, and will now price-match Amazon, Costco (COST) and 27 other retailers online. The big-box retailer is hiring 70,000 seasonal workers.The NRF predicts the hiring of a total of 700,000-750,000 seasonal workers this holiday season, ""in line with last year's 714,000 new holiday positions.""The Off-Price Is RightSeparately, off-price retailers should continue to grab market share from the full-price sector, ""given the secular preference of consumers,"" said Sourcing Journal founder Edward Hertzman, according to a Cowen & Co. report from Wednesday.Cowen's report says, ""Rather than gain share from one another, Hertzman sees continued growth at the various segments of off-price: a) high-end off-price stores incl. Saks OFF 5th and (Nordstrom) Rack, b) larger-scale incumbents where brands are key like (TJX's) T. J. Maxx (and) Marshall's, and c) price-conscious budget off-price stores incl. Ross (ROST) and Burlington (BURL) Coat Factory.""While Nordstrom is not exclusively an off-pricer, Rack has proven to be complementary to the main business, leading 1 million Rack shoppers back to the full-line or online Nordstrom store. Rack brought in 4 million new shoppers in 2014.But Macy's (M) new off-price concept, Macy's Backstage, is likely to cannibalize sales at the mainline stores, believes Hertzman, since there is a smaller price difference between Macy's full-price and off-price offerings.Cowen analysts see ""particularly strong growth opportunity for TJX"" and are positive on Nordstrom's off-price offshoot.For the holidays, Hertzman expects ""yet another promotional holiday season"" and sees shoppers gravitating toward electronics.Nordstrom shares closed up 1.5% in the stock market today. TJX shares rose 0.5%. Ross stock rose 1.8% and Macy's shares finished up 0.7%.Millennials' Online SpendingAccording to a report out Thursday from eBay (EBAY) spinoff PayPal (PYPL), millennials — a prized consumer group — are likeliest to want to use online credit to buy clothing and accessories, electronics and mobile devices through the end of 2015.The 20- and early 30-somethings make up PayPal Credit's fastest growing segment, it said.Follow Elaine Low on Twitter @IBD_ELow.RELATED:Retailers See New Things In Store For Online ShoppersAfter Amazon Prime Day, Retail Sales Take Apple PauseNordstrom, Macy's Look To TJ Maxx To Stay In Vogue

"
682,ROST,"Retailers hit a rough patch in March as severe winter weather, an economic speed bump and merchandise delays resulting from the West Coast port disruptions dragged down results, leading to the month's sales gains falling below views.
"
683,ROST,"Even amid the headwinds, L Brands (LB), Stein Mart (SMRT), Cato Corp. (CATO) and PriceSmart (PSMT) came shining through with same-store sales that sailed past views, according to data out Thursday.
"
684,ROST,"March sales at stores open at least a year rose 0.5% vs. a year earlier, according to Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics. Analysts expected a 1% gain.
"
685,ROST,"The results were weighed down by a big miss from warehouse club giant Costco Wholesale (COST), Perkins says. The company saw March same-store sales slide 2% from a year earlier, short of views for a 0.3% decline.
"
686,ROST,"That was the typical top retail performer's first decline in monthly same-store sales since August 2009, Perkins says.

688,ROST,"Costco's core U.S. same-store sales, ex gas and the effects of foreign exchange rates, were up a ""much healthier"" 4%, said Perkins. Still, they were below views for a 5.5% gain.
"
689,ROST,"""Costco was a huge drag on the month,"" Perkins told IBD. ""Part of that was attributable to them having lower year-over-year gas prices, and foreign currency translations also weighed on their sales.""

692,ROST,"Consumers weren't in the mood to buy seasonal goods like patio furniture and bathing suits or apparel when they were ""freezing,"" he said.
"
693,ROST,"But Jacksonville, Fla.-based Stein Mart and Charlotte, N.C.-based Cato, located in the South, where the weather was better, posted double-digit gains in March same-store sales, he adds.
"
694,ROST,"""Weather clearly played a big role overall (on the March results), both positive and negative,"" Perkins said.
"
695,ROST,"Another factor weighing on March sales was a slowdown in the economy in the first quarter, he adds. Perkins notes retailers also missed sales opportunities because of delays from late shipments due to the West Coast labor dispute.
"
696,ROST,"""Overall I would not read too much into the March numbers,"" Perkins said. ""The jobs market stands on pretty solid footing, and with warmer temperatures I would expect May, June and July sales to show significant improvement from the first quarter.""
"
697,ROST,"April Outlook
"
698,ROST,"This month is apt to be weak, Perkins says, mainly because the early Easter this year, on April 5, pushed holiday-related sales into March.
"
699,ROST,"The month's standouts are L Brands (which owns Victoria's Secret), value-priced apparel seller Cato and regional discount retail operator Stein Mart.
"
700,ROST,"L Brands posted a 9% increase in same-store sales for March, topping views for a 5.8% gain. The company's same-store sales for the month ""were positively impacted"" by the earlier Easter this year by about 3% to 4%, it said in a press release.
"
701,ROST,"Cato saw a 12% rise in the month's sales, sailing past estimates for a 3.8% gain. Cato also got a lift from the early Easter shift, the company said in a press release. But it expects April sales will be ""unfavorably impacted"" by the shift.

703,ROST,"Major apparel retailer Gap (GPS) posted a 2% rise in March same-store sales, well ahead of an estimate for a 0.5% gain.

739,ROST,"Shares of TJX (TJX) gapped up to a new all-time high after the off-price retailer came out ahead of second-quarter forecasts, raised full-year comp and EPS guidance, and sounded optimistic about the upcoming holiday season.The parent of T.J. Maxx, HomeGoods and Marshalls said that its earnings grew almost 7% to 80 cents a share, 4 cents above estimates. Revenue rose 6.5% to $7.36 billion vs. views for $7.25 billion. Currency headwinds had a 4 percentage point negative impact on consolidated Q2 net sales and a neutral impact on Q2 EPS, said the company.Fueled by customer traffic, consolidated same-store sales rose 6%.""It was great to see that comp sales were entirely driven by customer traffic — our fifth consecutive quarter of sequential traffic improvement — and that we had strong sales across all of our divisions,"" said CEO Carol Meyrowitz in a statement.Domestic T.J. Maxx and Marshalls same-store sales collectively rose 4% in Q2, while HomeGoods comps climbed 9%. Abroad, TJX Canada comps jumped 12%, while TJX Europe comps rose 5% on a constant currency basis.

The boost reflects strong Q2 results and ""a higher comp store sales growth assumption for the second half of the year, largely offset by expected additional foreign currency headwinds and higher supply chain costs than originally planned.""But the ramped-up outlook remains below Wall Street expectations for per-share earnings of $3.32 for the year.TJX anticipates 3%-4% in consolidated same-store sales growth for the year, up from earlier guidance for 2%-3% comp growth.For Q3, the company expects 80-82 cents in per-share earnings, below current views for 89 cents a share. Foreign exchange headwinds are anticipated to be ""significantly greater than originally planned due to the continued decline of the Canadian dollar.""Cowen & Co. analyst Oliver Chen wrote Tuesday that he remained ""incrementally encouraged"" by the health and momentum of the off-price model, based on factors like TJX's same-store sales and full-year guidance boost in the face of currency headwinds.E-commerce, global sales and square footage growth remain ""significant growth drivers,"" he added.Follow Elaine Low on Twitter: @IBD_ELow.RELATED:TJX, Ross Stores Q2 EPS And Revenue Seen Decelerating.

Sales rose 23%, as the top line continued an accelerating trend of growth.Analysts noted strength in its industrial and automotive markets.Apple (AAPL), a tech leader that could be viewed as a consumer stock too, is another high-tech stock that's found a home in the Big Cap 20. The stock is near new highs, extended from its breakout past 119.85 last month.In the medical sector, drugmakers Biogen Idec (BIIB), Pharmacyclics (PCYC) and Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX) have rallied in recent weeks and account for some of the best percentage gains in the Big Cap 20 over the past couple of weeks.UnitedHealth Group (UNH) and Cigna (CI) are part of a broad rally in HMO stocks.While those medical leaders are extended, Mylan (MYL) is setting up in a base with a 59.70 buy point.However, its shares fell moderately after the close Monday, when the company reported Q4 earnings of $1.05 a share, an increase of 35%.

894,ROST,"Holiday hiring is in full swing, and this year — like last year — the biggest employment gains are expected in a handful of retail sectors, according to the Pew Research Center.In November, clothing companies and department stores accounted for more than half of retail job gains, adding 121,600 and 114,700 jobs, respectively, noted Pew Research in a report issued Friday.Last year, nearly a third of the retail-job surge over the holidays occurred in clothing/accessories stores, with 202,400 jobs added from October through December. Department stores followed with 177,400 new jobs.Retail payrolls typically rise 3% to 4% between October and December, Pew said. Some 626,200 retail jobs were added in November and December last year, for a 4.1% gain over the earlier year.Other big holiday hirers are general merchandise stores and sporting goods, hobby, book and music stores, Pew said.Macy's (M) announced in late September that this year it would hire seasonal associates for about 86,000 positions at its Macy's and Bloomingdale's stores and in other parts of the company, up about 3.6% from 2013, with 10,000 of the jobs based in fulfillment centers that support online ordering and other aspects of Macy's ""omnichannel"" selling strategy.This holiday shopping season is broadly shaping up stronger than expected so far in terms of retailer revenue, despite some reports of a lackluster Black Friday. Sales at stores open at least a year rose 5% year over year in November, according to a Retail Metrics index, while forecasts had called for just a 3.4% rise.Considering factors such as earnings growth and stock market gains, Ross Stores (ROST) and TJX (TJX) are the highest-rated stocks in IBD's retail-apparel group, which is ranked 34 out of 197 industry groups in stock market performance. Nordstrom (JWN) and Macy's are the highest-rated stocks in the retail-department store industry, though the sector itself is ranked relatively low.What happens after all that holiday hiring? What goes up must come down. Retail payrolls typically fall 5% to 6% between December and February, Pew's research noted. Last year, the retail sector shed 888,000 jobs in the two months after December. That was more than the number hired over the holidays, as some retailers with disappointing results laid off staff or closed poorly performing stores.""If history is any guide, retail payrolls will rise again this month before dropping sharply after the New Year,"" wrote Pew Research's Drew DeSilver.Sectors that don't much change their hiring policy over the holidays are nonseasonal grocery and drug stores and building materials and garden supply stores, which hit their peak payrolls in summer.Related: Costco, Gap Lead Solid November Holiday Start.

1023,ROST,"It's important to know the cup-without-handle base and cup-with-handle base, two classic stock chart patterns.Chartists also need to make sure they're familiar with a related structure, which IBD has dubbed the saucer base.As you might guess, the saucer is a shallower pattern than the cup. You might see a correction of about 12% to 20%, while a typical cup can run as deep as 35%.Sometimes a stock will tack on a handle to its saucer base. Other times it's in a hurry, and the stock breaks out to new highs without sketching a handle.What about length? A proper saucer takes at least seven weeks to develop. You also could have saucers that are a year long or more.For a good example of a saucer base, check out Ross Stores ' (ROST) action in 2010.The Pleasanton, Calif.-based discount clothing and home goods retailer began to etch the saucer in mid-June 2010, as it slid toward its 10-week line. (1)You could also view the saucer as starting in late April, and that would give roughly the same left-side high for the pattern.Ross established a bottom for this saucer in August 2010, and then it proceeded to build the base's right side. The pattern featured a correction of 16% — or 17%, if you viewed the pattern as starting in late April.Ross appeared to add a handle to its saucer in late September and early October.  (2) However, volume wasn't strong as the stock moved past that handle pattern. A better interpretation is just to view Ross' consolidation as a simple saucer.In mid-to-late October, the stock edged past a 56.72 handle buy point and out of that saucer (the weekly chart reflects a 2-for-1 split in December 2011). In the Nov. 1 IBD, Ross held an 88 Composite Rating, a 97 EPS, 74 RS and an A grade for SMR.Then in the week ended Nov. 5, big volume kicked in, and Ross really charged ahead. (3)Sometimes volume can kick in a bit late with a breakout, but the move still works out.Note this breakout occurred not long after the Sept. 1, 2010, follow-through day that signaled a fresh market uptrend. That means if you bought the stock, you benefited from a positive general environment.Ross rose 144%, building new bases along the way, until it peaked in August 2012.
