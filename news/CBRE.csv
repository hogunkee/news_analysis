8,CBRE,"""Avoiding behavioral risk"" is more than a Wall Street slogan to Vladimir ""Val"" de Vassal. It is a tactic he has raised to an art form as he aims to remove subjectivity from his hunt for top-performing growth stocks for two Glenmede mutual funds of which he's lead manager. Fueled in recent quarters by leading growth stocks like Apple (AAPL), Adobe Systems (ADBE) and Mastercard (MA), $4 billion Large Cap Growth (GTLLX) and $2.9 billion Large Cap Core (GTLOX) both outperformed the S&P 500 in calendar 2017 as well as over the three, five and 10 years ended Dec. 31.Only 10% of U.S. diversified stock funds with at least $100 million in assets racked up that four-way feat, which makes them winners of the 2018 IBD Best Mutual Funds Award.De Vassal and his team — including managers Paul Sullivan and Alex Attanasiu — have become adept at avoiding behavioral risk in their investment process. Instead, they focus on more than 80 objective yardsticks to measure each growth stock's worthiness. They wear blinders to block out less-meaningful information that can be distractions from data that mark growth stocks poised to advance. Emotions are a major part of behavioral risk, de Vassal says.De Vassal, age 58, talked with IBD about his strategy from his office in Philadelphia.Best Mutual Funds Monthly Performance ReportIBD: How do your growth-oriented mutual funds differ from rival growth funds?De Vassal: First, both funds use a similar process. The difference is the benchmark. For Core, it is the Russell 1000 Index. For Large Cap Growth, it is the Russell Growth. We control industry and sector exposures against those benchmarks.Our strategies are a blend of quantitative discipline based on underlying fundamental insights.IBD: How do you avoid letting emotions interfere with your hunt for growth stocks?De Vassal: We've built a library of factors, over 80, across the two strategies. In any sector, there are about 15 to 25 factors that we use to differentiate stocks. They're a combination of such things as valuation metrics, fundamental metrics and estimate revisions from sell-side analysts. We include some technical indicators as well.IBD: Give me examples of subjective metrics that you avoid.De Vassal: Subjective metrics that we do not use include the popularity of a company — its brand name — and nonquantifiable intangibles such as future products and profits that are not reflected in sell-side analyst earnings or revenue estimates. ... We want to remove behavioral risks that may have adverse effects on portfolio performance.IBD: Limiting downside risk plays a big role in your approach, right?De Vassal: We aim to win by avoiding negative earnings surprises and at the same time tilting more toward stocks that are more likely to have positive surprises.IBD: Basically, the difference between these two funds is that one focuses exclusively on growth stocks while Core Fund can own various types of stocks?De Vassal: In simplest terms, yes. And that means Large Cap Growth has much heavier concentration in technology stocks, for example.IBD: These funds are 2018 IBD Best Mutual Funds Award winners. What does it take to outperform so consistently?De Vassal: We have a very disciplined process. And both portfolios are well diversified. Performance isn't driven by being lucky or unlucky in one or two names. And we try to avoid losers, not just identify winners. We try to improve every year. This year we added two new stock selection factors. One is supply-chain data. The other is ESG (environomental, social and governance) momentum. We've been managing for some form of ESG strategy for over 15 years. We've found ESG momentum works better in some sectors, like consumer staples, consumer discretionary and technology, than in others.IBD: Do you see the iPhone as the key to Apple's future? Or do you see additional services like the App Store, Apple Music and Apple Pay, playing a bigger role?De Vassal: We look at fundamental metrics like return on invested capital. We look at valuation. We look at cash flow per employee. We look at sell-side analysts' earnings estimates, revenue estimates, cash flow estimates. We ask ourselves whether new products and services are causing analysts to increase their estimates. (A sell-side analyst works for an outside firm, not the fund.)We don't have a fundamental analyst kicking the tires on Apple. We look at what's happened in the past. Which (outside) analysts have been the most accurate, looking back nine quarters? Then we look at what they have to say.IBD: Avoiding emotion in your decisions is a key part of your search for growth stocks. What's an example of that?De Vassal: Growth Fund started its stake in Adobe Systems in October. The stock was attractively valued. Later that month they gave (positive) guidance and the stock shot up. We sold in November with a gain over 18%. When a stock moves, we're out because it's no longer attractive.IBD: Mastercard earnings per share growth has accelerated for three quarters. What's your view going forward?De Vassal: We bought it in June 2016. It's done well. It's a holding. We're comfortable with it. But it's not a position we would add to.IBD: You've got Visa (V) as well. Do you like it better?De Vassal: At this point, Visa looks a little more attractive. Mastercard outperformed over the past 12 months, so its valuation is up. Visa's is better. Visa is still a buy for us.IBD: IPG Photonics (IPGP) is another newcomer to Growth Fund. Do you still like it?De Vassal: We started this in August 2017. The valuation was reasonable. Cash flow yield was around 2.4%. Not that strong. But fundamentals were good. Revisions were fairly positive. Price momentum was fairly good. We think revisions are more likely to have positive surprises than negative surprises.IBD: You more than doubled your share count in TD Ameritrade (AMTD) recently. Why?De Vassal: It was September 2017 when we doubled. Its dividend yield was reasonable, and so were its profitability metrics. Analysts were raising their earnings and revenue estimates. It got good (share) price momentum. We've done well with it.IBD: Brick and mortar retailers aren't very popular these days. But you've got discounter Ross Stores (ROST). Why?De Vassal: We still consider it a buy. We've been underweight in consumer discretionary. But we're getting more neutral. Part of the reason is rebalancing the portfolio in industry groups. Looking at Ross' metrics, it's got a healthy combination of valuation, fundamentals and sell-side earnings revisions.IBD: Citrix Systems (CTXS) is in Core Fund. What's driving the speed up in its quarterly EPS growth?De Vassal: It has good profitability metrics. And we've seen more analysts covering the stock, which could lead to increased investors interest.IBD: What's driving the uptrend in CBRE Group (CBRE), which provides property management, loan servicing and origination services?De Vassal: This is one of the best ranked REITs based on our proprietary stock-ranking screens. In terms of metrics, we look at EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) and we look at the consistency of its risk-adjusted growth. Analysts are raising their estimates consistently.IBD: You've trimmed your exposure to Nvidia (NVDA). Does that mean you don't like it as much anymore?De Vassal: We cap a stock's maximum weighting at 2% of Core Fund and 3% of Growth. In contrast, benchmarks are too top heavy. They have too much exposure to the top names.We initially pursued Nvidia in Core in May 2016. The stock had an attractive valuation and improving fundamentals and estimate revisions. Its share price gained a lot, and it bumped our 2% limit so we had to trim it. It has continued up. It's no longer cheap, and it's not a position we would add to.IBD: What has driven the uptrend by F5 Networks (FFIV), which makes data center computing gear?De Vassal: Its valuation isn't cheap, but it's reasonable. Its fundamentals have been strong. Its return on invested capital and cash flow per employee have been favorable vs. its peers. It's got increased coverage from sell-side analysts. So there's a stronger likelihood for positive earnings surprises than some of its peers have.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE:Growth Stocks In Tech And Health Care: Fund Managers Like Their OutlookSee Which Stock The Best Mutual Funds Have Been BuyingU.S. Treasuries Led Bond Funds Higher As 10-Year Yield Tumbled To 2.8%You Need This Much Retirement Savings At Your Age And IncomeFour Ways You Can Cut Spending In Retirement — With Little Lifestyle Sacrifice

25,CBRE,"The Hudson Valley Mall, nestled on a picturesque hilltop in Kingston, N.Y., looks like a pleasant place to spend an afternoon — from the outside. Inside, it just feels empty.Until recently, the 765,000-square-foot structure was best known for its infamous past as the scene of a Columbine-inspired shooting in 2005, when a local gunman fired off 60 rounds from an assault rifle. J.C. Penney (JCP)shuttered its store in 2015, and Macy's (M) closed its doors last year. Smaller retailers followed, and as of Feb. 2016, 33% of the mall space — not including anchor stores — sat vacant, according to Bloomberg data.The property, which was appraised at a value of $87 million in 2010, sold for $9.4 million in January to Hull Property Group, an Augusta, Ga.-based operator that has spent the last decade bringing distressed malls back to life. The company, which owns 29 malls across the U.S., sticks to a proven script that includes negotiating tax incentives with local governments, demolishing excess space, and reversing public perceptions that the property is struggling.""If the grim reaper hasn't come yet, then he's circling pretty good,"" said Jim Hull, managing principal of the company, describing the properties he targets.Buying malls on the cheap leaves Hull with plenty of money for aesthetic improvements, such as raising the ceilings and removing kiosks in a bid to create long sight lines and a sense of open space. Other tactics include hanging sheetrock over empty storefronts and ending leases with down-market tenants in hopes of attracting more upscale retailers.Hull is one of a small crowd of operators bucking the conventional wisdom that there are simply too many malls and that only those catering to wealthy shoppers will survive the death of legacy retailers. While operating strategies vary, most are shopping for older malls in places with no other enclosed shopping center within 50 to 100 miles.Such older properties have some inherent advantages. Many were built as the surrounding community was sprouting, so the original developers had their pick of the best locations. Despite the rise of e-commerce, people still come to malls to participate in the social aspect of shopping — especially in suburban or exurban places with few large gathering places.Andy Weiner, president of Houston-based RockStep Capital, paid $28 million when he bought the Bonita Lakes Mall in Meridian, Miss., in May, a fraction of the $85 million it cost to build when it was completed in 1997. Weiner, who has acquired about 6 million square feet of mall space over the last two decades, says his mission is ""to make small town America better."" His company is now working to revive the facility by upgrading the movie theater and bringing in the nontraditional tenants — a community college, say, or a government office — that mall operators are increasingly courting in hopes of increasing foot traffic. Over the longer term, Weiner is betting that he can make money by passing on discounted rents to retail tenants.""If you own it at 20 cents on the dollar, you can provide tenants with very profitable stores, because you can give them cheap rents,"" he explained.Time Equities, a New York-based real estate firm, has long invested in strip malls, said Ami Ziff, director of retail at the company. Over the past five years, the rise of the dead-mall narrative led the company to start hunting for contrarian opportunities. It bought its first enclosed mall in 2010 and its fifth in Zanesville, Ohio, earlier this year. By the end of 2017, Ziff said, the company would like to own 10.Like other operators buying on the cheap, Ziff's team makes small improvements — replacing old signage, adding murals, and upgrading the nursing stations in the women's bathrooms — and bets that a mall can still be a shopping and entertainment hub.""We want to be in markets where the mall is still one of the more interesting things to do on the weekend,"" Ziff said.Some malls struggle because they simply can't access credit, said George Good, executive vice president in CBRE Group's National Retail Investment Group. As department stores close and large mall operators retrench around their best assets, many lenders have decided to stop financing lower-quality properties. In many cases, owners that can't get a new loan will look to sell at a discount, or let the mall go into foreclosure.""It's almost a self-fulfilling prophecy,"" said Good.Not every struggling mall is a good candidate for a refresh. In bigger markets with stiffer retail competition, developers have considered more radical strategies for failed malls, such as turning them into office buildings, medical centers, and hotels with mixed results. The City of Charlotte, N.C., bought a closed mall in 2012 and demolished it, kicking around plans to build a mixed-use development, or perhaps a Major League Soccer stadium on the site. Nothing has come to fruition, though, and last year the city issued a call for proposals on a listing service that specializes in such distressed properties as landfills and abandoned chemical plants.Still, the vicious nature of the retail business makes plenty of opportunities for investors.""We think there are somewhere between 100 and 200 malls out there that fit the general criteria"" for a rehab, said Chris Maguire, chief executive officer at Cypress Equities, a Dallas-based investor that bought a 40-year-old regional mall in Flagstaff, Ariz., earlier this year. ""They need capital, but there's cash flowing, so you just sit and wait.""RELATED:Seeking E-Commerce Shoots Among Retail's Brick-And-Mortar DeclineWho's Driving The Housing Recovery Now?

26,CBRE,"While the suburbs might never regain the kind of broad appeal in America that they had half a century ago, there's more evidence of a renewed exodus from the city to the suburbs, largely driven by affordability.Last year, commercial real estate company CBRE Group (CBG) reported that only about 30% of millennials in the U.S. — those born between 1980 and 1995 — live in cities, while ""the other 70% do not appear to be rushing to move downtown,"" but instead were part of a migration from urban areas to the suburbs. And this week Realtor.com said its analysis of data from 2010 to 2017 finds that ""households in the suburbs grew 7.9% nationally, compared with 6.6% growth in urban areas.""""Rising home prices and inventory shortages in urban centers have made affordable suburban home prices more appealing for buyers,"" said Jonathan Smoke, chief economist for the real estate listings and data website, in the report's news release.Prompted by its analysis showing that 50% of those planning to buy a home in the U.S. this spring prefer suburbs, Realtor.com came up with what it calls America's suburban  hot spots: the neighborhoods most notable for their ""increasing prices, fast home sales, and tough competition among buyers."" It's conclusion? ""America's most sought-after suburban neighborhoods are often the exurbs of its fastest-expanding metros.""""Suburbs are traditionally viewed as meccas for young families, willing to trade in shorter commute times and urban night life for better schools and larger homes,"" said Smoke. ""But the relationship between the suburbs and urban areas is far more intertwined.""Tops among suburban hot spots is Northeast Denver, in the 80239 ZIP code and next to Rocky Mountain Arsenal National Wildlife Refuge. Realtor.com said the median home price ""jumped 27% last year,"" which makes it ""the fastest-growing suburban neighborhood"" — but that still gets you a 50% savings compared with city prices.Next is Dallas' Wylie neighborhood in the 75098 ZIP, which the website touts as having been ""named one of the safest cities in the U.S."" and also as offering a savings of 26% over the city.Third is Dublin in the San Francisco Bay Area's 94568 ZIP code, which the site says offers ""a rare pocket of (relative) affordability"" by saving you 22% over an urban locale, and it has top-rated schools besides.Absent from the list of hot spots are any neighborhoods in the Northeast or upper Midwest. With the exception of the San Jose, Calif., suburb of Milpitas, the rest of the top 10 are in the South, with three in Florida alone.To determine what qualified as a suburb, Realtor.com looked at population densities in the ZIP codes of the country's 50 largest metropolitan areas. It then rated their hotness by the growth in the number of households between 2010 and 2017; the growth in listing prices from 2010 to the end of 2016; how often home listings in those areas were viewed; and the number of days for-sale homes remained on the market. It restricted the ZIP codes to only one for each metro area.MORE ABOUT HOMEBUYING:U.S. Homebuyers' Break-Even Point Just Got A Little More DistantSurvey Finds That The Most Affordable Major Housing Markets Are In AmericaTrending Home Improvement Projects For 2017's Housing MarketHomebuying Cheaper Than Renting In Most Of U.S., But For How Long?

28,CBRE,"If they were anywhere else in Beijing, the five young women in cowboy hats and matching red, white and blue costumes would look wildly out of place. But here at the city's biggest international property fair — a frenetic gathering of brokers, developers and other real estate professionals all jockeying for the attention of Chinese buyers — the quintet of wannabe Texans fits right in. As they promote Houston town houses (""Yours for as little as $350,000!""), a Portugal contingent touts its Golden Visa program and the Australian delegation lures passers-by with stuffed kangaroos.Welcome to ground zero for the world's largest cross-border residential property boom. Motivated by a weakening yuan, surging domestic housing costs and the desire to secure offshore footholds, Chinese citizens are snapping up overseas homes at an accelerating pace. They're also venturing further afield than ever before, spreading beyond the likes of Sydney and Vancouver to lower-priced markets including Houston, Thailand's Pattaya Beach and Malaysia's Johor Bahru.The buying spree has defied Chinese government efforts to restrict capital outflows and shows little sign of slowing after an estimated $15 billion of overseas real estate purchases in the first half. For cities in the cross hairs, the challenge is to balance the economic benefits of Chinese demand against the risk that rising home prices spur a public backlash.""The Chinese have managed to accumulate very large amounts of wealth, and the opportunities to deploy that capital in their own market are somewhat restricted,"" said Richard Barkham, the London-based chief global economist at CBRE Group (CBG), the world's largest commercial property brokerage. ""China has more than a billion people. Personally, I think we have just seen a trickle.""While a dearth of government statistics makes it difficult to gain a comprehensive view of cross-border real estate investments, most industry projections point to a surge in Chinese purchases. Ping An Haofang, an online real estate platform owned by China's second-largest insurer, says its $15 billion first-half estimate, derived from market data, nearly matches the figure for all of 2015.Fang Holdings, the country's most popular property website, predicts overseas buying on its system will increase 130% this year, while transactions through September at Shenzhen World Union Properties Consultancy, China's largest broker for new-home sales, were already 50% above last year's level. The country overtook Canada as the largest source of residential purchases in America last year after an estimated $93 billion of buying from 2010 to 2015, according to a May report by the Asia Society and Rosen Consulting Group.It adds up to the world's biggest-ever wave of overseas residential property investment, according to Susan Wachter, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School who specializes in real estate markets. While Japan had a similar boom in the 1980s, it was mainly focused on commercial buildings, Wachter said.Today's Chinese buyers have a long list of reasons to flock overseas. The yuan's slump is eroding their purchasing power, while returns on local financial assets — including stocks, bonds and wealth-management products — are shrinking as the $11 trillion economy slows.Chinese real estate, meanwhile, has grown increasingly out of reach after a speculative boom sent domestic home prices to all-time highs. Residential property values in Shenzhen, Beijing and Shanghai all jumped more than 30% in the year through September, according to the National Bureau of Statistics.""Properties in Shanghai are ridiculously expensive,"" Chen Feng, 38, said as he evaluated prospects at a property fair in Shanghai in September, lured by television commercials for the event the night before. ""With the amount of money it takes to buy a small apartment here, I can buy a building of apartments in many places in the world.""That line of reasoning is nothing new, of course. Sydney, Vancouver, Hong Kong, London and a handful of other cities have long been popular destinations for Chinese buyers.The difference now is that those traditional hot spots are starting to lose their appeal, due to soaring prices and new measures to deter an influx of overseas money. In Hong Kong, the government enacted a 30% tax on foreign property owners this month after Chinese demand pushed home values toward record highs.The risk of similar measures in other cities can't be ruled out as politicians including President-elect Donald Trump tap into local discontent over rising living costs, according to CBRE Group's Barkham.Chinese buyers have responded by branching out to cheaper cities. In the U.S., they're increasingly searching for properties in Houston, Orlando and Seattle, which displaced San Francisco in the first quarter as the third-most-viewed U.S. market on Juwai.com, a Chinese search engine for offshore real estate.At the national level, countries in Southeast Asia have grown more popular. Juwai.com's queries on Thailand are surging at a 72% annual rate, helping it surpass Britain as one of the top five most-targeted destinations worldwide earlier this year.In Pattaya Beach, Chinese investors have snapped up 20% of the luxury condos on offer from Kingdom Property over the past year. The properties offer Gulf of Thailand views for as little as $120,000, or less than a quarter of what buyers would pay for a typical apartment in central Shanghai, according to Han Bing, a 30-year-old anchor in Chinese television shows who doubles as a sales agent for the Bangkok-based developer.""It's a cool bargain for a retirement plan,"" Han said.In the Malaysian state of Johor, across the northern border of Singapore, major Chinese builders including Country Garden Holdings, Greenland Holdings and Guangzhou R&F Properties are developing new projects. Country Garden agents handed out fliers for the firm's $37 billion Forest City development at the Beijing property fair in September, advertising permanent property rights, zero inheritance taxes, long-term residence visas and high-quality hospitals.One challenge for Chinese investors is getting money out of a country that caps individuals' foreign-currency purchases at $50,000 a year. While that limit hasn't always been strictly enforced, the yuan's slump is prompting policymakers to clamp down. This year, they've banned the use of friends' currency quotas, curbed on the cross-border activities of underground banks and asked lenders to reduce foreign-exchange sales.Still, alternative routes abound. Many business owners finance their homes through offshore trading companies, while some Chinese developers allow clients to pay for overseas units in yuan. Foreign-currency mortgages also play a role, helping to fund more than 80% of China's international property purchases, according to an estimate by Fang Holdings based on user searches and surveys.""Where there's a will, there's a way,"" said David Ley, a professor at the University of British Columbia who wrote a book on the flood of wealthy migrants from East Asia in the 1980s and 1990s.This year's purchases could be just the tip of the iceberg. Chinese holdings of global real estate, including commercial properties, will probably swell to $220 billion by 2020 from $80 billion in 2015, according to Juwai.com.As the first generation born after China's opening in the late 1970s approaches middle age, many of them want an overseas base for family members to travel, study and work. Chinese parents with children at foreign schools have been a major source of demand, accounting for an estimated 45% of cross-border buying, according to Fang Holdings.Zha Liangliang, a 31-year-old owner of commercial wheat farms in China's eastern Jiangsu province, said he purchased a $587,000 apartment in Sydney in August and plans to add five more before sending his children to high school in Australia. He's flying to the country this month to view homes and farmland, hoping to buy before the yuan weakens any further.For some investors, it's never too early to pull the trigger. Richard Baumert, a partner at Millennium Partners Boston, tells the story of a 33-year-old Chinese man who purchased a luxury home for his future children in August, convinced they're destined to attend one of the city's prestigious universities.The buyer shelled out $2.4 million for the property, Baumert said, unfazed by the fact that he's single and it could be two decades before he has kids old enough for college.MORE ABOUT HOMEBUYING:Return Of The Single Female HomebuyerAmerica's Foreclosure Activity Flares UpBest Homebuying Markets For Millennials

29,CBRE,"Landlords on Manhattan's Fifth Avenue are sitting on a record amount of open space as retailers balk at committing to expensive new leases in one of the world's most prestigious shopping districts.The availability rate on the famed strip, home to Saks (SKS) Fifth Avenue and Tiffany & Co.'s (TIF)flagship store, jumped to 15.9% in the third quarter, up from about 10% a year earlier, according to Cushman & Wakefield. The rate has climbed steadily this year, surpassing the prior peak of 11.3%, set in the fourth quarter of 2014.The rise of empty storefronts isn't limited to Fifth Avenue. It's part of a Manhattan-wide space glut as retailers -- buffeted by e-commerce, tepid demand for luxury goods and a strong dollar that's eroded tourist spending -- push back against rents that have soared to records. Leasing costs have increased in tandem with property values in the past five years, outpacing gains in merchandise sales and making it impossible for retailers to run profitable stores at many locations, according to Richard Hodos, a vice chairman at brokerage CBRE Group (CBG).""Property trades are being based on achieving ever-higher rents, and nobody ever really looks at what retailers can afford to pay,"" Hodos said. ""In some cases, rents need to come down 30% or more for rents to be at levels where retailers are able to make sense of them again.""Retailers are being squeezed across the U.S. In 2016, malls and other types of shopping venues have been hit by 280 major-brand store closures, totaling 12.8 million square feet (1.2 million square meters), data from Reis (REIS) show. Another real estate research firm, Green Street Advisors, estimates that several hundred malls around the country will cease operations over the next decade.Shoppers continue to shift their spending from stores to computers and smartphones. Online sales in the U.S. are expected to reach $398 billion this year, up 16% from 2015, according to research firm eMarketer.On the stretch of Fifth Avenue from 49th to 60th streets, which commands the world's highest rents, landlords are asking an average of $3,213 a square foot, up from $2,075 a square foot in 2011, Cushman data show. In the tourist-heavy Times Square area, rents stand at $2,104 a square foot after tripling over a four-year period.The brokerage's retail availability rate takes into account vacancies as well as stores occupied by merchants that plan to leave when their leases expire. Retailers that signed leases at high prices in the past several years and are seeking a tenant to sublease their space are also included, according to Steve Soutendijk, an executive director at Cushman.""Tenants that signed at the absolute top of the market are looking to mitigate their exposure,"" he said.At 667 Madison Ave., a 24-story tower two blocks from Central Park, Michael Kors Holdings (KOR) is looking to sublease about 5,000 square feet of retail space at the base of the building, according to a person familiar with the plans. The store, with 22-foot ceilings, was the company's largest when it opened in 2012, the New York Times reported at the time.Four years later, the London-based fashion house is struggling to pay the rent, said the person, who asked not to be identified because negotiations aren't public. Michael Kors is seeking a tenant to take over the space on a lease that runs through 2023, the person said.A spokeswoman for Michael Kors declined to comment. Representatives for the company's landlord, Hartz Group, didn't respond to calls and emails seeking comment.Property owners with space to fill are starting to lower their expectations, according to Cushman's Soutendijk. Asking rents in some of Manhattan's prime shopping districts, including Soho and Times Square, have declined over the course of 2016, Cushman data show.""I think a lot of landlords are ready to make deals,"" Soutendijk said. ""Everybody understands there is too much space in the market. We are not in a state of equilibrium.""Buyers of real estate during the recent boom years may not have much room to maneuver. To justify paying record prices for buildings -- and the debt that financed the acquisitions -- owners are under pressure to get the highest rents possible, according to Patrick Smith, a vice chairman of the retail brokerage at Jones Lang LaSalle (JLL).""Typically, a building that has been capitalized over the past three years is very rent-sensitive,"" he said.Landlords who hold out for the right tenant can be left hanging on to empty space for years. A partnership of developer Thor Equities and General Growth Properties, the second-largest owner of U.S. malls, bought 530 Fifth Ave. in 2014. During a conference call with analysts that year, General Growth Chief Executive Officer Sandeep Mathrani highlighted the property's large, vacant block as an opportunity to attract new retailers.No new retail leases have been signed at the property since the acquisition, though three tenants are close to agreements, according to a person with knowledge of the plans. The prospective occupants are in the health-and-beauty and sporting-goods businesses, and will likely pay less in rent than what the building owners had originally aimed for, said the person, who asked not to be identified because negotiations are ongoing.Representatives for Thor and General Growth declined to comment on plans for the property. The building sits between 44th and 45th Streets, several blocks south of Fifth Avenue's most-sought-after addresses. The availability rate in the area has climbed to 29%, Cushman data show.Manhattan's empty storefronts will eventually be absorbed, according to Smith of Jones Lang. The way space is used may change to focus more on the experience than just the merchandise -- for example, Lululemon Athletica (LULU) offers yoga classes in its stores -- but New York will always be a magnet for retailers and shoppers, he said.""Will Fifth Avenue, which has been a multigenerational place to shop and has evolved over many, many decades, continue to be a successful place? Absolutely,"" Smith said. ""Will it look the same? No.""MORE ABOUT RETAIL PROPERTY:J.C.

30,CBRE,"Not very long ago, it was fashionable to ask if millennials would ever crawl out of their parents' basements and into a realty agent's office. Enthusiasm for that view, which had gained wide exposure by 2012, lost steam as mortgages got easier to come by and millennials kept insisting that no, actually, they do want to own a home.A flurry of recent reports should further dispel the notion that millennials are allergic to homeownership.Half of U.S. homebuyers are under 36, Zillow reports, based on a survey of 13,000 respondents, and first-time buyers account for 47% of purchases. First-timers make up 52% of prospective buyers planning home purchases in 2017, according to the results of another survey, published by Realtor.com. When the company conducted the same survey last year, it found that only 33% of prospective buyers were first-timers.Millennials, it seems, are poised to take a bigger share of the U.S. housing market.This is mostly a matter of basic math and common sense.First-timers have always made up a large share of home purchases, and their median age has hovered around 33. Back in the days when serious people were afraid that young people, burdened with student debt and enamored of city living, had quit on homeownership, the oldest millennials simply hadn't yet reached the age at which most Americans have historically bought their first homes.Now, millennials are aging into the prime years for first-time homebuying, and evidence is mounting that they're becoming the dominant force in the U.S. housing market.Last month, the Urban Institute pointed out that mortgages to first-time homebuyers had recovered to 2001 levels, while repeat purchasers continue to do home renovations or wallow in the post-housing-crisis doldrums. (That analysis excludes cash buyers and includes boomerang buyers -- foreclosure victims re-entering the market — as first-timers.) Meanwhile, the credit bureau TransUnion reports that 60% of first-time homebuyers in the fourth quarter of 2015 were between the ages of 20 and 39.So why did anyone believe young people were done with homeownership?In the years following the global financial crisis, which began with easy credit, it was hard to qualify for mortgages. Millennials carry more student debt than older Americans, though it's hard to say how much that keeps them from buying a home. American households are likelier to be found in rental housing than at any time in the past 50 years, and the trend away from homeownership has shown up among the young.But millennials, despite all you read about what they like and hate and will buy and won't buy, are people, and people in America have a long history of favoring the benefits conferred by homeownership -- stability, price appreciation, and tax credits among them.Their biggest roadblock to homeownership may not be personal preference or personal finance. According to a recent analysis by Fannie Mae economists, a bigger obstacle is single-family landlords, who have snapped up a massive slug of starter homes in recent years, turning millennial homebuyers' likely targets into rental properties.That may explain another finding from the Zillow survey: As a group, millennials have skipped past traditional starter homes, buying first homes that are about as large and as expensive as the homes purchased by members of older generations.Millennials showed up in the housing market later than some people expected. Now they're making up for lost time.RELATED:Millennials' Mass Migration To Cities Is An Urban Myth, CBRE SaysThe Best Homebuying Markets For Millennials Are In Midlevel MetrosDown-Payment Picture Appears Brighter Than Homebuyers Think

31,CBRE,"The smell of fresh-cut grass on an autumn afternoon. A marching band belting out its fight song. The stadium creaking under the weight of 100,000 beer-soaked fans. The stimuli of college football look, sound, and smell like big money to television networks, apparel makers, and vendors of all kinds. Now landlords have joined the game as well.Over the last two decades, property managers have discovered that renting off-campus beds to college students can be a great business. It makes sense: College enrollments have boomed, but funding for on-campus housing hasn't. Private landlords stepped into the void, developing new, luxurious units, complete with golf simulators and resort-style swimming pools.More recently, investors have come to see student housing as a hedge against a recession. It's a safe place to park capital, the theory goes, since young people go to college whether the economy is good or bad. The safest student housing, from an investors' perspective, is found near big-time college football schools, which enjoy broader brand recognition than other universities.""There's a perceived value -- and probably a real value,"" said Jeanette Rice, head of investment research for the Americas at commercial real estate firm CBRE Group (CBG).According to CBRE data, 50 out of 68 off-campus student housing complexes that changed hands during the first half of 2016 served students whose schools field football teams in the NCAA's Division I -- the highest level of competition. Thirty-four of those asset sales involved apartments near schools that belong to the so-called power conferences, which generally have the top-ranked teams.Investors also paid higher prices for apartments located near these football powerhouses, based on the average capitalization rates, which represent expected rental income as a ratio of purchase price. The cap rate for student housing complexes near non-Division I schools was 6.4%; the cap rate for apartments near schools participating in Division I power conferences was 5.5%. In layman's terms, investors paid more and earned lower yields for the privilege of renting to Gators, Longhorns, and Wolverines.A good football team isn't the only reason such schools enjoy strong reputations, stable enrollment, and therefore, a steady supply of renters for off-campus housing. In most state university systems, schools with large athletic departments are also those with stronger academic reputations and research facilities. But CBRE discovered that being close to a top football program definitely helps.""Those schools are getting students from a broader geography, and they're getting better students,"" Rice said. That means more overall demand for housing and most likely, a student body with greater ability to pay higher rents.The same operating principle has long led single-family landlords to target properties within walking distance to big, public universities, said Dennis Cisterna, chief revenue officer at Investability Real Estate, a marketplace for buying and selling rental homes. Compared to older tenants, college students can be transient and prone to destructive behavior. The trade-off for exposure to collegiate high jinks is that proximity to campus lets landlords access a steady supply of new renters.""If someone drops out of Ohio State or decides to go to a new school, there's always going to be a flock of new students,"" Cisterna said.Small landlords, like large property managers, relish turning on the television on Saturday afternoon and seeing a stadium full of tenants.RELATED:Investors Flock To Safe, Steady Student Housing PlaysWhy These Landlords Are Scoring Profits On College StudentsThree REITs Unfazed By Prospect Of Higher Interest Rates

32,CBRE,"The red-hot growth in home prices across the U.S. West is starting to slow in some cities as sticker shock and low inventory put off weary buyers.Denver, Los Angeles and Austin, Texas, have seen gains in real estate values moderate after years of double-digit increases, according to Zillow. A slowdown in the tech epicenter of San Francisco is becoming even more pronounced, with the median home value in August rising less than 1% from a year earlier.The five-year surge in real estate demand across the West is starting to take its toll in some areas as buyers become more reluctant to purchase a home that would eat up a large chunk of their monthly earnings. With job growth still robust, house hunters are pushing outward from core cities to get more for their money.""Homebuyers are starting to see a bit of price fatigue and are starting to step back and think twice about making that purchase,"" said Svenja Gudell, chief economist at Seattle-based Zillow Group (Z). ""Prices have grown so much over the last few years as part of the recovery that many markets are well beyond their initial 2006 or 2007 peak, so homes are now more expensive than they've ever been.""Western cities have led the nation's recovery from last decade's recession with record-setting economic growth and a boom in jobs, particularly in the technology industry, leading to a surge in housing demand. In the past five years, home values have soared 71% in Denver, 66% in San Francisco and 54% in Austin, Texas, Zillow data show. Nationwide, the gain was 22%.The prices have gotten too heated for many buyers in Denver, which has seen a slowdown since the beginning of the year, said Wade Perry, a managing broker at Coldwell Banker Devonshire in the area.""Buyers are starting to push back and say, 'I'm not going to pay that much for that house,' "" Perry said.The median home value in Denver rose 10% in August from a year earlier to $353,300, according to Zillow. While that's still one of the top increases in the country, it's down from an almost 16% surge in the same period of 2015.In Austin, which, like Denver, has benefited in part from a spreading tech industry and an influx of well-paid workers, the median climbed 8.1%, compared with 12% growth a year earlier. Los Angeles's growth slowed to 6.9% from 7.5%, while in San Diego it decelerated to 4% from 6.3%.For San Francisco, where the median home value has soared to $1.1 million, the increase was just 0.6% after a 15% jump in August 2015. The city's price gains have made it the most overvalued housing market in the U.S., UBS Group said in a report this week.Still, there's no letup in some other Western tech-heavy markets, such as Portland, Ore., where home values soared 20% in August, compared with 13% a year earlier. In Seattle, the 15% gain outpaced the roughly 14% increase the year before.Nationwide, the median home value climbed 5.1% in August — up from 4.6% a year earlier.A slowdown in home-price appreciation would be a healthy change, said Patrick Carlisle, chief marketing analyst at Paragon Real Estate Group in San Francisco.""The cooling of a desperately overheated housing market to something closer to normal is not bad news,"" he said. ""The huge increases in housing prices have created enormous social stresses in the area, as well as leading some of our local high-tech companies and would-be startups to look at locating elsewhere.""The overheated markets are pushing some buyers to shift their house hunt to the suburbs, fueling faster appreciation in outlying areas than in the neighboring boom cities, Zillow data show. In the Denver suburb of Arvada, for instance, the median home value in August soared 13% from a year earlier. It jumped almost 14% in Englewood, a short light-rail ride from downtown.Ben and Nicole Irwin began looking for homes in the area last year and soon discovered the Denver properties that they liked cost $500,000 to $600,000. The couple ended up paying $390,000 for a three-bedroom house in Arvada, where they were attracted to good public schools, a charming old town and the city's proximity to the Red Rocks Amphitheatre, a popular outdoor concert venue.""To get the size house we wanted, it would have been out of our price range,"" said Ben Irwin, a 37-year-old communications manager for the city of Boulder. ""We found that we could get those kinds of houses for $150,000 to $200,000 less"" outside of Denver.In Austin, where home prices are higher but sales are down, surrounding towns ""have seen incredible appreciation"" as buyers seek out affordability in the city's outskirts, said Dave Murray, a broker at DMTX Realty.Murray, a real estate agent in the area since 1984, said he's shocked when he drives into previously undeveloped suburban areas ""and there's an entire master-planned community and a thousand homes that have popped up in the last two to three years.""Similar trends are playing out in the San Francisco Bay Area, where Oakland is booming while San Francisco slows, and San Diego, where prices are gaining faster in suburbs such as Chula Vista and Escondido.Rent growth is also tapering off in many Western cities, in part because of a spate of construction in downtowns that added thousands of new apartments to the market. In San Francisco, hiring slowed in the first half of the year and housing prices have hit a level that fewer people are willing to pay, Carlisle said.The city's median rent rose 2.5% in August, compared with a 17% increase a year earlier, according to Zillow. In Austin, rents climbed 2.6%, less than the 8.4% increase the year before, while Denver's growth slowed to 4.4% from 12%. Similar slowdowns were seen in Los Angeles, Phoenix, San Diego, Salt Lake City, Portland and Seattle.It isn't for lack of demand that prices are slowing in core Western cities, said Lawrence Yun, chief economist at the National Association of Realtors.""The tapering off in the downtown areas is due to the fact that it's very pricey and people are seeking more affordable areas,"" Yun said. ""If somehow the downtown area were to see any price decline, there would be a rush of buyers coming into downtown again.""RELATED:Millennials' Mass Migration To Cities Is An Urban Myth, CBRE SaysFewer Vacant Homes In U.S., But 3 Out Of 4 Belong To Investors Homebuyers Getting More Anxious About Affordability, Redfin SaysUnearth Hidden Gems With Rich Yields In The New Real Estate Sector

76,CBRE,"While it's a generally held view in real estate circles that millennials are being drawn toward urban cores to work and live, leaving the suburbs to stagnate, the reality appears more complex.Recent patterns of millennial migration suggest just the opposite, says recent research by commercial real estate company CBRE Group (CBG). Looking at the most recent U.S. Census data, CBRE's analysis says about 30% of millennials -- in this case defined ""roughly"" as born between 1980 and 1995 -- reside in cities. But, it adds, ""the other 70% do not appear to be rushing to move downtown.""Among the midrange set of millennials age 25 to 29, for example, 426,000 went from suburbs to cities in 2014 while 529,000 did the opposite. And for those age 20 to 24, CBRE said, the suburban migration ""was even more pronounced"" -- though it acknowledged that ""some were returning to childhood rooms or basements in their parents' homes.""It found even more evidence for urban outflow among older millennials and the youngest members of Generation X -- those 30 to 44: 1.2 million of them left cities for suburbs while 540,000 headed in the opposite direction.CBRE's analysis also examined office market data to detect any evidence there to support a dramatic urban migration by millennials -- who now outnumber baby boomers as America's biggest generation and are also its largest segment of the workforce.In comparing cities with suburbs, it measured the zones' net absorption of office space -- the amount occupied at the end of a year minus the amount occupied at a year's start -- to their net rentable area and concluded that ""downtown office markets nationwide have significantly outperformed their suburban counterparts less than one-third of the time since the year 2000.""Downtown markets did, however, do a little better after the Great Recession -- outperforming the suburbs in two of the years from 2010 to 2015. But the first half of this year shows 64% of suburbs as outperforming.So what accounts for the common wisdom that holds that cities are surging while suburbs are sinking? CBRE speculates that ""media stories and observations from certain high-profile cities have likely propped up the narrative."" (Hello, San Francisco, New York and D.C.!) And those few post-recession years when cities actually did outperform suburbs likely also contributed.CBRE's researchers also theorize that, while there are grounds for millennials' reputation as metrocentric, what many of them are looking for is the best of both worlds: places with a mixed-use ""urban feel"" but with ample living space. In slang terms, ""hipsturbia"" or the ""urban burbs.""In terms of making investment decisions, however, the report cautions that ""each market has its own dynamics,"" and while ""there is some truth to the idea of a resurgent urban core, it is also fair to say that the death of the suburbs and millennials' love of the cities have been greatly exaggerated.""Related:Why Talented Millennials Are Turning To The Smaller Tech HubsBig-City Millennials Are Under-Saving On First-Home Down PaymentsThe Best Homebuying Markets For Millennials Are In Midlevel Metros

77,CBRE,"While competing developers focus on pricier single-family homes, Jim Clarke is building town houses for cash-strapped millennials. And the units are going fast.Almost a third of Robertson Brothers Homes' projects are for town houses, compared with zero a few years ago, said Clarke, president of the closely held builder, based near Detroit. The 37-home Sherman Oaks development opened for sales a year ago, walking distance from the thriving downtown in Royal Oak, Mich., and it's almost sold out. Now the company is starting three more projects, Clarke said.""Millennials are underserved,"" he said. ""The only way to get affordable housing built in a lot of these areas is by attaching it.""Town houses, which are often less expensive than detached single-family homes because they're smaller and more densely packed, are making a comeback in the U.S. as young people, saddled with student debt, look for an affordable path to homeownership. Starts for attached homes increased to 28,000 in the second quarter, the highest level since the fourth quarter of 2007, according to recent data from the Commerce Department. In the past four quarters combined, town house construction jumped 26%, more than double the growth for detached properties.First-time homebuyers accounted for 33% of all sales in June, up from 30% in May and the largest share since July 2012, according to the National Association of Realtors.""It's a hint that we can see builders growing the entry-level space,"" said Robert Dietz, chief economist at the National Association of Home Builders. ""This is the single-family experience in a slightly more affordable development.""Homebuilders during much of the recovery have been appealing to wealthier buyers with bigger houses, partly because land and labor costs have been rising — a trend that's left many first-time buyers on the sidelines. In the second quarter, town houses accounted for almost 13% of single-family starts, up from a low of less than 9% in 2011.In the next few years, town house construction is likely to surge past the 16% peak reached during the last boom, in 2007, Dietz said. Small builders working locally will probably lead the charge, he said.Andy and Chad Baker, 37-year-old identical twins, are getting ready to build 30 town houses on 1.5 acres just east of downtown Nashville, Tenn. They're knocking down three single-family houses to make way for the project, which will have homes of about 1,700 square feet with two-car garages.""It's the middle ground, literally and figuratively, for a lot of millennials,"" Andy Baker said. ""They want to be close to the downtown, so being a few miles away is the best of both worlds. You have some green space but you don't have the parking hassles.""The typical U.S. town house has less than 2,000 square feet, compared with about 2,500 square feet for a detached house, Dietz said.Clarke, the Michigan builder, said many of his buyers couldn't afford a single-family home close to the action in downtown Royal Oaks. A detached home in the area would be about $100,000 more expensive than the $280,000 his town houses go for, he said.""You're giving up your yard,"" Clarke said, ""but what you're getting is that you're walking distance from the restaurants and bars.""RELATED:Millennials' Mass Migration To Cities Is An Urban Myth, CBRE SaysHomebuilders Have Designs On Millennial HomebuyersHomebuyers Are Waging Multiple Bidding Wars At Once, Redfin Says  
"
78,CBRE,"Stacey Smith and her husband looked at about three dozen homes in the San Francisco Bay Area and lost a bidding war before finally purchasing a four-bedroom house in June for $1.5 million — 40% more than the asking price.Their search wasn't in Silicon Valley or San Francisco. It was just across the bay in Oakland, which has supplanted its pricier and better-known neighbors to become the region's most heated real estate market.""Something we had to wrap our head around really quickly was the fact that we were automatically going to bid at least 30% over asking,"" said Smith, a 50-year-old strategy consultant who moved from San Francisco in search of more space for her family's three kids. ""It's the new normal.""Oakland's housing market is still soaring, even as growth cools in San Francisco, where million-dollar median home prices have left buyers searching for more-affordable alternatives. The East Bay city had California's highest annual appreciation of home values and the biggest rent growth of the 50 largest U.S. cities as of June, according to data compiled by Zillow.Despite persistently high crime rates and political turmoil, Oakland is attracting residents for its relative affordability, vibrant cultural scene, diverse population and urban environment within commuting distance to San Francisco. Companies such as Uber Technologies are moving in — helping to fuel a 43% jump in office rents in two years — while big investors including Blackstone Group (BX) and Boston Properties (BXP) are putting money into residential projects in the city.""Oakland is the hottest residential real estate market in the Bay Area,"" said Kenneth Rosen, chairman of the Fisher Center for Real Estate and Urban Economics at the University of California, Berkeley. ""It's still expensive, but it's more affordable"" than San Francisco.Oakland home values soared 16% in June from a year earlier to a median $616,300, the biggest gain of California's major cities, according to Zillow. The median monthly rent jumped 15%, the most in the U.S., to $2,846 in the same period. That was almost triple the 5.5% growth in San Francisco, and more than five times the nationwide increase.Houses are selling fast — and far above list prices. The average home in Oakland sold for 17% more than asking in the second quarter, according to data from Paragon Real Estate Group measuring properties that didn't go through a price reduction first. That compared with 9% for San Francisco and 5% in Silicon Valley's Santa Clara and San Mateo counties. Oakland homes were on the market an average of 20 days, fewer than the 34 days in San Francisco.""Most markets would be pleased if they averaged asking price, or 1% or 2% over asking price,"" said Patrick Carlisle, chief market analyst at Paragon. ""To see things averaging 9% to 17% over asking price is virtually unheard of. It's the highest I've ever seen.""The median home price in Oakland has soared 178% since 2011, almost double the gain in San Francisco, Paragon data show.Oakland is still struggling with a reputation for social and political unrest. Its police department is operating without a chief after three departed, one after another, in the span of about a week in June amid a sex scandal involving officers and a teenage prostitute. It's also an epicenter of social protests, including those connected to the Black Lives Matter and Occupy Wall Street movements.The troubles aren't deterring newcomers, city officials say.""It's not slowing growth in the way that it used to five or 10 years ago,"" said Marisa Raya, an economic analyst in Oakland's office of economic and workforce development. ""But we are certainly seeing a lot of political activism around the superfast rent growth.""Oakland voters will consider ballot measures in November to strengthen rent control and issue bonds for affordable housing.Blackstone has teamed with CityView, a property company started by former U.S. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Henry Cisneros, to build a 423-unit apartment complex in Oakland. The $175 million project at 3093 Broadway, due to be finished in 2018, is the first development in the city for the world's largest alternative-asset manager.Jon Gray, Blackstone's billionaire head of real estate, said he thinks Oakland may become the next Brooklyn — a comparison that has frequently been evoked in recent years as the city comes into its own as a hot spot after previously being overshadowed by its glitzier neighbor.""We very rarely do ground-up development, so this project reflects our strong confidence in the transformation under way in Oakland,"" Gray said in an e-mail.Boston Properties, the largest publicly traded U.S. office owner, signed a letter of intent to invest in a 25-story residential development in Oakland's Temescal neighborhood, Chief Executive Officer Owen Thomas said on a July 27 earnings conference call.""Given the high cost of multifamily product in the San Francisco market, we believe we can deliver high-quality units that are approximately at a 20% discount to San Francisco rents in a location that is a 16-minute transit ride from the Embarcadero BART Station in downtown San Francisco,"" he said on the call. Arista Joyner, a spokeswoman for the company, declined to comment further.Oakland's job growth also is showing signs of outpacing its neighbor, with listings up 16% since April, compared with a 1% decline in San Francisco, according to LinkUp, a job-search engine based in Minneapolis. Among the companies setting up shop is San Francisco-based Uber, which last year bought the old Sears (SHLD) building in Oakland's urban core and is renovating it, with plans to open in late 2017.The city is home to consumer-products maker Clorox (CLX); Kaiser Permanente, a nonprofit health insurer and hospital chain; and internet-radio service Pandora Media (P).The rate for top-quality office space in the city has grown 43% in the second quarter compared with two years earlier, while San Francisco's rent is up 20% in that time, according to data from real estate brokerage CBRE Group (CBG).The influx of companies is helping to prop up housing prices. Even as the technology industry slows, there are still ""many, many buyers"" in Oakland, said Carla Buffington, a real estate broker at Pacific Union in the city.""We're seeing a majority of properties selling with multiple offers,"" Buffington said.

79,CBRE,"The Runway Playa Vista in Los Angeles recently added a Whole Foods Market (WFM), a movie theater, and upscale shops and restaurants -- retail center staples intended to attract affluent shoppers, condo-buyers and tech companies to the mixed-use development. The next big tenant slated to move in, however, is a little different: A 32,000-square-foot doctors' office, where the Cedars-Sinai Health System plans to house outpatient services including obstetrics, gynecology and pediatrics.While urgent-care centers have been strip-mall staples for decades, the chance to catch dinner, a movie and a surgical procedure under the same roof is new -- and coming soon to a mall near you. The reason is commerce: Mall operators are looking for tenants that trade in entertainment and services to replace the brick-and-mortar retailers slowly being strangled by Amazon.com (AMZN) and its online competitors. Rents, particularly at older malls, are a bargain.The health care industry, meanwhile, is moving away from centralized campuses to bring services closer to patients at a time when two key demographics are entering prime years for consumption. Boomers are hitting an age when they can expect to use more health care services; millennials are starting families and beginning to make doctors appointments for their kids.Put those factors together, and voila: You can get your blood pressure checked just steps from the steakhouse.Chris Isola, vice president in the health care service group for CBRE (CBG), says the idea of putting medical clinics in malls is one that landlords are just starting to come around to. ""I think from Cedars' perspective, that's how you capture the younger demographic,"" he explains. ""The challenge is convincing the landlord of a highly desirable center that there should be a medical clinic. It's like, 'This is why you should put Cedars here and not break up the space for five or six boutiques.' ""Gauging just how rapidly health care companies are absorbing retail space is difficult, because the industry is composed of regional and local players, many of which are using only small amounts of space. CoStar Group (CSGP), a commercial real estate data and analytics firm, has begun tracking health care companies as retail tenants only in recent years, making it hard to measure the industry's footprint. But the consensus among observers is that it's the wave of the future.""It's a big part of demand growth for retail space,"" said Hans Nordby, managing director for Portfolio Strategy at CoStar. ""Ten years from now we aren't going to think anything about it. It will be like, I went to the strip mall, I saw the doctor, and then I bought a pair of shoes.""Cedars-Sinai isn't the only health care provider to take a large space in a retail mall. Others include Prime Healthcare Services, which operates a 23,500-square-foot ambulatory care facility at the Plymouth Meeting Mall outside Philadelphia. Last year, UCLA Health put a dozen doctors in a new medical office at the Village at Westfield Topanga, a high-end mall in Woodland Hills, Calif.Then there's Vanderbilt University Medical Group, which occupies the entire second level at the 100 Oaks Mall in Nashville, Tenn., where patients can pick up a pager when they check in at a clinic, then browse the outlet shops on the lower level while they wait. It used to be that only restaurants would give you a pager to let you know when your table was ready. Now it means the results of your CT scan are in.As this transformation has begun to take shape, strip malls seem to be more popular than traditional malls because they offer medical tenants an appealing prospect: parking spaces directly in front of their stores so the elderly and infirm don't need to cover large distances, let alone navigate stairs or escalators.While outpatient facilities and doctors offices make the move from hospitals and medical suites to the mall, about one-third of the 7,200 urgent-care centers in the U.S. are already there, said Steve Sellars, president of the Urgent Care Association of America. The industry is adding a few hundred new urgent-care centers a year, leading operators to try out new locations. Care Here!, a Brentwood, Tenn.-based health and wellness company, even opened a walk-in clinic in the Nashville airport.For the health care companies, softness in the retail market has helped them negotiate favorable leases, including improvement allowances. Medical facilities also look good financially as tenants, with credit profiles that stack up well compared with nail salons and fast-food restaurants.Still, there's a learning curve on both sides, said Sarah Bader, leader of the global health and wellness practice at the architecture firm Gensler. Many landlords are still coming to grips with the idea that medical clinics won't scare off other businesses, and health care companies are just learning how to use retail space to build stronger relationships with their customers.  In some cases, landlords had promised existing tenants they wouldn't rent to a doctor's office or dialysis center, and will need to renegotiate leases to get permission.""When you go to Starbucks (SBUX), you know it's a Starbucks,"" she said. ""It's been a challenge, because health care systems aren't particularly brand-savvy clients."" Bader has been working with such companies as Chicago's Northwestern Memorial Hospital to create a design manifesto for its growing retail footprint. ""You want people to know that whether they're having an operation or going to the pediatrician, they're in the same health system.""Related:U.S. Shopping Malls Beset By Debt Are Facing An AccountingREITs Preparing For Spotlight Teach Money Managers How They Work

80,CBRE,"Developers Steven Shores and Marc Pollack found a way to stand out from the crowd rushing to build apartments in Atlanta's ritziest neighborhood: They're putting their 315-unit project in Buckhead on hold.""We found ourselves wondering if it makes sense now to move forward on a project when four or five others are on the exact same schedule,"" said Shores, whose company, Pollack Shores Real Estate Group, will wait a year, then reassess its plan for the luxury building. ""We are in it for the long term. There's no reason we can't hold off temporarily.""Apartment developers are starting to tread more carefully as cracks appear in the five-year-old boom that sent rents soaring to records across the U.S. Construction concentrated in fast-growing urban markets has left cities from New York to Denver and San Francisco with a surplus of high-end units. Rent growth has already tapered off in some areas, and lenders are getting more selective about the projects they fund.Builders went upscale to preserve profits squeezed by rising land and labor costs. Now they'll need to work harder to find renters willing to pay a premium for trendy locations and frills such as rooftop pools and fire pits. About 30% of the apartment units under construction are in cities, compared with 15% in the previous decade, according to multifamily-data firm MPF Research.""Everybody fell in love with these markets and wanted to build -- but you can't build forever, it doesn't work that way,"" said Ryan Severino, chief economist at research firm Reis. ""The apartment market is losing steam.""The second quarter was the fifth straight in which construction exceeded net gains in occupancy, according to a report Reis issued early this month. With almost 200,000 units completed over the past 12 months, ""2016 is set to challenge records for construction figures, if not break them,"" the firm said.Apartment owners are the worst performers among real estate investment trusts this year. A measure of multifamily landlords has lost 0.3%, compared with a 12% gain for the broader Bloomberg REIT index. Equity Residential (EQR), the biggest U.S. apartment REIT, cut its revenue forecast when new leases in New York and San Francisco fell short of expectations because of an increase in supply in those cities.Effective rents in San Francisco, where apartment construction is at a record high, rose 2.6% in the second quarter after climbing 9.6% a year earlier, data from Axiometrics Inc. show. In Manhattan, deal sweeteners such as a free month were included in 13% of new leases in May, up from 1.6% a year earlier, according to a report by appraiser Miller Samuel Inc. and brokerage Douglas Elliman Real Estate.Smaller cities also are awash in high-end supply. In Denver, one of the nation's most robust economies, rents rose 4% in the second quarter from a year earlier, down from 11.2% growth for the same period in 2015, according to Axiometrics. Houston, reeling from the oil slump, will get 27,575 new units this year, more than any other U.S. city. Effective rents there, up 3.8% a year ago, dropped 1.4% in the second quarter.In Austin, Texas, where technology jobs are driving up wages, 12,130 units will be delivered over the next 12 months, the most since 1985, said Robin Davis, manager of data firm Apartmenttrends.com. The 1,124 apartments under construction downtown would expand that area's rental market by about 31%.Developer Mike Lynd has shelved a midrise building planned for suburban Austin with 325 units, and a tower of more than 30 stories in Houston. Lenders have started tightening underwriting, and land costs in Austin have doubled in three years, ""choking off the ability to add supply to Austin in a big way,"" he said.Average rents downtown, which increased 1.2% in the first quarter, would have been flat if not for the recent debuts of some of Austin's most-expensive buildings, Davis said.""The number of units coming online is at such a high price tag,"" she said. ""The central core is going to take time to absorb these units.""At one of those properties, Lynd's The Bowie, renters are being offered as much as eight weeks free for some floor plans. One-bedroom prices start at $2,000 a month, and amenities include a 36th-floor pool deck billed as the highest in Texas. The tower -- which opened a year ago and is 82% full -- is leasing out about 19 units a month, a pace Lynd said he's pleased with because the high rents limit demand. Financing approval for the project was based on a lease-up rate of 20 apartments a month, he said.Federal banking regulators in December urged commercial lenders to be vigilant in monitoring and managing risk and reinforced earlier warnings about competitive pressures and rapid growth in some lending markets.""Bad loans tend to happen in good times because of competition and the ease of capital liquidity -- it tends to be at this point in the cycle that banks and lenders increase their risk appetite,"" Richard Taft, deputy comptroller for credit risk at the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, said in a phone interview.Rising interest rates or a decline in rental income would make it harder for borrowers to refinance when loans come due in a few years, said Sam Chandan, dean of the Schack Institute of Real Estate at New York University.""The possibility that rent growth will lose some momentum is not being taken into careful account by every lender in the market,"" Chandan said. ""If there was only one lender in the market, they wouldn't need to push the envelope. Competition is good, but right now it is particularly intense.""So far, borrowers have given commercial lenders no reason to panic. The delinquency rate for bank-held multifamily loans was 0.26% in the first quarter, the lowest since 2005, data from the Mortgage Bankers Association show. The share of loans at least 90 days late was as high as 4.71% in 2010. And banks getting more choosy may already be resulting in a trail-off of construction. Permits to start work on multifamily buildings have fallen 12% since January, Census Bureau data show.""Lenders are a little cautious because they think we've had our run and it's possible we've peaked,"" said Michael Riccio, senior managing director for debt and structured finance at CBRE Capital Markets, which brokers and originates commercial loans.Shores, the developer who's delaying the Atlanta building, said there are still opportunities to build. His company is moving ahead with a project in the city's fast-growing Midtown neighborhood.""We are, in selected markets, seeing a wave of supply come, so that we're just being cautious -- we're not stopping development,"" he said. ""We are making sure we have the best sites and best equity partners who have a longer-term focus.""

In Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA), revenue rose 6% in local currency but declined 5% when converted to U.S. dollars.CBRE guided full-year earnings in a range of $1.90 to $1.95 a share vs. consensus of $1.95. The company's shares closed slightly higher at 38.66 on Tuesday. Shares jumped 2.3% at the open of the stock market today. The stock set a high of 39.33 on April 2.The Q1 results come less than a month after CBRE announced plans to buy Johnson Controls' (JCI) workplace solutions unithttp://news.investors.com/business/033115-745827-cbre-acquiring-johnson-controls-workplace-solutions-business.htm for $1.475 billion.The Johnson Controls unit will operate as part of CBRE's Global Corporate Services business.

136,CBRE,"As the tech industry gets a firmer foothold on the amount of office space it's leasing, highly skilled tech workers are making tracks for jobs in smaller markets where it's cheaper to live, and this is having a dramatic effect on the value of commercial real estate, a new report says.In the past five years, high-tech companies' involvement in major office leases grew from 11% to 18% in the U.S., which is the largest stake of any industry, says the study from CBRE released June 30. In its annual ""Scoring Tech Talent"" report, the commercial real estate services and investment firm still gives its highest marks to technology hubs like the San Francisco Bay Area; Washington, D.C.; and Seattle for depth and breadth of talent and opportunities, but it sees momentum shifting to outliers like Charlotte, N.C.; Nashville, Tenn.; and Oklahoma City.The report ranks the top 50 U.S. and Canadian technology markets by ""their ability to attract and grow tech talent."" The 13 metrics by which CBRE measures them include the supply and concentration of tech talent; prospects for job growth; education levels; and expectations for increased rents for offices and homes.A big factor in the growth of tech talent in those markets was ""the robust entrance of millennials into the labor pool,"" said the report's author, Colin Yasukochi, in statement released with the report. Along with large populations of millennials, the top markets are also home to a high ratio of well-educated workers and of colleges that are turning out tech talent.But while a metropolitan area like Los Angeles might score high in the sheer number of tech graduates it produces (with 12,679 in 2014, L.A. trailed only New York and Washington, D.C.), migration by those grads is shifting the momentum to markets where living might be cheaper, or more appealing in other ways such as quality of life. For instance, renting in Los Angeles takes an even greater chunk out the average tech worker's wage than it does in San Francisco. L.A., with a 27.6% rent-to-earnings ratio, is behind only New York City, at 33.2%, and Long Island, barely higher at 27.7%.Compare that to Nashville, where the average rent takes 17.3% of the average tech wage, or Charlotte, where it's 13% -- less even than in Detroit (13.9%), which was so notoriously crippled by the housing meltdown of a decade ago. The lowest rent-to-earnings ratio among the markets that CBRE surveyed was Oklahoma City's, and at only 12% that might go a long way to explaining that metro's tech-talent growth rate of 59%.Likewise, Oklahoma City has the most rock-bottom cost for office rentals, with annual asking rent at $16.94 per square foot. That's just under Detroit's $17.54.New York City is at the top of that column at $75.35, with the San Francisco Bay Area next at $59.59. After that, rents drop precipitously, with Vancouver, B.C., in third at $39.93. Those also in the $30-plus range include Washington, D.C.; Boston; L.A.; Toronto; Miami; Austin, Texas; San Diego, Calif.; and Seattle.What does all that mean for commercial real estate? While tech capitals like the Bay Area and New York have seen office rents double in the past five years, smaller cities are now seeing accelerating demand, says the CBRE report. It notes that Nashville ""has the lowest vacancy rate of the top 50 tech-talent markets.""And for residential properties, CBRE sees ""a profound impact"" from ""the in-migration of talent to these tech markets"" because ""even among the most expensive markets, tech wages are able to cover the high cost of living.""Related:The Best Homebuying Markets For Millennials Are In Midlevel MetrosAmazon's Biospheres Aim To Change The Workplace NaturallyBig-City Millennials Are Under-Saving On First-Home Down Payments

138,CBRE,"The first thing online clothing reseller ThredUp did after clinching a new round of funding last year? Hunt for strategic warehouse space to get the goods to its customers as fast as possible. Amazon.com (AMZN) has spoiled consumers for anything less.Within six months, ThredUp's chief executive, James Reinhart, had signed leases on two additional warehouses. The newest facility, outside Atlanta, is now being filled with inventory. The 150,000-square-foot space is ThredUp's gateway to the southeastern U.S., an operations hub where the secondhand clothes are received, inspected, sorted, stored on racks, and then packaged and shipped out the back door.The new need for speed means retailers need more warehouses in more locations. Early on, ThredUp had only one warehouse, in California. ""It took forever to get stuff to the East Coast,"" said Reinhart, 37. ""It used to suck for that customer.""Over the past year, prime warehouse rents are up 9.9% across the U.S. and up by double-digit amounts in some large urban areas, according to a recent report. In some cities, surging demand has helped set off a speculative-building boom unlike anything in recent memory. In the first three months of the year, warehouse developers in the Chicago area broke ground on more speculative projects than in any quarter during the past two decades, according to Ryan Bain, a vice president at CBRE Group (CBG). There are currently 28 warehouse users in the market for 18 million square feet of space, triple the available supply, Bain said.E-commerce alone is responsible for 20% of the current demand, according to Eric Frankel, an analyst at Green Street Advisors, helping to drive the spike in construction despite retail sales growth that has been slower than in previous economic expansions. Space close to population centers has become an especially hot commodity as startups compete for space with such shippers as FedEx (FDX) and traditional retailers like Macy’s (M) pursue the dream of same-day delivery.Much of the warehouse craze is a reaction to a single player. Amazon has built a massive network of distribution centers as the muscle behind its re-education of the American consumer. Shoppers have gotten used to short shipping times when ordering from the retail giant's vast inventory of goods, forcing traditional retailers to build out online platforms and the capability to ship to consumers directly from brick-and-mortar stores.“For the past 30 years, supply chains have been cost centers,” said Karl Siebrecht, chief executive of Flexe, a 3-year-old company that styles itself as the Airbnb of warehouse space. “Amazon came in and turned supply chains into a growth weapon. Now the whole retail industry is trying to keep up.”The dynamic has helped turn a mundane corner of real estate into a hot property.“They are boring,” said Anthony Pricco, a principal at the Chicago-based builder Bridge Development Partners, of his company’s buildings. “We do tours with our capital partners, and after the third one their eyes start to glaze over. But cash flow is sexy, and these things tend to do pretty well.”In Dallas, a handy location for reaching customers in the fourth-largest U.S. metro area, as well as for shipping to customers elsewhere in the fast-growing state, more than 14 million square feet of warehouse space is under construction on spec, according to CBRE. That number doesn’t include build-to-suit construction, in which the user of the space hires a developer to build a site to its specification. In the Kansas City area, speculative builders completed 3 million square feet of space after building just 155,000 square feet in 2012.From the beginning, ThredUp's Reinhart looked to cut down on shipping times, but it's expensive to build that kind of distribution network. Previously, retailers set up one or two large centers in the middle of the country to store and ship their products. Now they're looking for smaller spaces in more places. Reinhart's chief operating officer viewed 20 buildings in the Atlanta area before picking the one ThredUp would lease. Problems ranged from lack of internet access to a dearth of public transportation for workers.""Finding really good space is always a challenge,"" said Reinhart, who is already analyzing data in a search of his next location.Amid the growth, a new model of the modern warehouse has emerged. In decades past, when distribution centers were used to ship pallets of boxes to brick-and-mortar stores, ceilings topped out at around 24 feet. Go back further and the standard warehouse was a brick building near a seaport or railyard, the kind of structure developers are currently remodeling as startup office spaces and luxury lofts.These days, some developers are building warehouses with 40-foot clearances to accommodate tall racks of shelves from which workers can pick products to fulfill customer orders. Some new construction comes with 2,000 parking spaces, or more, to accommodate the armies of workers brought on during the holiday rush.“For 50 years, the warehouse development business was simple. You would build one exit farther out on the Interstate, and then you would just buy the next farmer’s land,” said Philip Hawkins, chief executive of DCT Industrial Trust (DCT), a Denver-based builder. Tenants were focused on price per square foot and didn’t mind driving a few extra miles, Hawkins said. Today they want to be closer to city centers, where large tracts of land can be harder to come by, driving up costs.Optimistic companies overextended themselves in the last economic cycle, leaving many in dire condition when growth screeched to a halt. In the current building boom, developers are doing a better job of matching new supply to existing demand, said Sam Chandan, president of Chandan Economics, a provider of real estate data and analysis. Still, developers now building spec projects could end up holding unwanted properties if the economy were to cool down.“A big piece of this is that there’s just more packages moving around,” Chandan said. “But if you’re starting a construction project now, you run the risk of being done at the worst possible time.”Related:Starbucks, Nike Lead IBD 50 Stocks Outsmarting Crummy Retail SpaceBrick-And-Mortar Retail Doing Solid Business, Mall Landlords SayUnder Armour's Huge New Warehouse Said To Top Amazon

139,CBRE,"Wedding season is here. But couples aren't the only ones who need to decide whether it's time to put a ring on it. Companies should worry about getting engaged, too.To their employees, that is. A big chunk of American workers have checked out from their jobs -- and are thinking about ending the relationship.That's troublesome for employers. Study after study shows that companies with engaged workforces outperform their competitors. Conversely, low morale saps the bottom line. If people don't like their jobs, they're less productive or quit. And replacing them is expensive.Fortunately, employers don't have to set aside two months' salary and get down on one knee to engage their workers. They simply need to change the way they interact with them -- and give them more control over their work environments.According to a recent Gallup survey, 51% of employees are not engaged in their jobs -- that is, they're not involved in, enthusiastic about or committed to their work. Seventeen percent are ""actively disengaged.""Such employee dissatisfaction is costly. Replacing an entry-level employee can cost 30% or more of her annual salary. Actively disengaged employees cost the U.S. economy $370 billion annually in lost productivity.Executives can start to recoup some of those losses by spending less time behind their desks. Over half of employees who strongly believe their managers are ""open and approachable"" are engaged at work, according to Gallup. That's far above the national average engagement rate of 32%.Managers who take time to cultivate relationships with employees deliver tangible results. A study of 3,000 companies conducted by the University of Pennsylvania found that spending 10% of revenue on team development increases productivity by 8.5%. That's double the gain in productivity that accompanies a similar investment in capital improvements.Employers should use those newly flowering relationships to set clear, shared goals with their workers. Two-thirds of employees whose managers help them set such goals report being engaged at work.Indeed, companies that help employees set goals are four times more likely to rank among the top 25% of businesses in terms of company performance, according to Deloitte analysts.Yet only half of U.S. workers say that their managers are currently following through.Companies can keep employees focused on their goals -- and easily recognize staff for achieving them -- by showcasing key metrics on data dashboards for all to see. Companies like Eventbrite and Etsy, for instance, use big screens to display real-time analytics on sales, social media engagement, customer satisfaction and more.Finally, forward-thinking companies should allow their employees to pursue those goals where and how they want to. And that means offering a wide range of environments suited to different kinds of work.For instance, employees might choose private areas to focus on individual assignments but transition to shared, yet still defined, spaces to interact one-on-one with their coworkers. Some may wish to get their creative juices flowing and regenerate in public spaces or outdoors. Open environments -- or a glass-walled ""aquarium-style"" conference room -- may be necessary to facilitate collaboration and yield fresh new ideas for solving problems.Such flexibility makes workers happier. Employee satisfaction jumps 10% to 15% when companies allow them to choose from a variety of work environments, according to a study of 20,000 workers conducted by real estate services firm CBRE.Happy employees are productive employees. Yet many executives seemingly can't be bothered with employee engagement issues. A 2015 study found that 98% of CEOs review employee engagement surveys just once a year and don't go over them with their employees. Over 70% left employee engagement to the human resources department exclusively.Companies are hemorrhaging talented people and billions of dollars simply by being indifferent to their employees. Smart managers can stanch this flow by making more of a commitment to their workers. Doing so will re-engage them with their work -- and turn potentially messy breakups into happily-ever-afters.

141,CBRE,"Office subleasing, an early indicator of past downturns, is at its highest level since 2010. The amount of available space from subleases in the city jumped to 1.9 million square feet (176,500 square meters) last month, a 46% increase from the end of the third quarter, according to a report from Cushman & Wakefield. Twitter (TWTR), Intuit (INTU), and Zenefits are among tech companies putting excess space on the market.“It’s the beginning of the change,” said Kenneth Rosen, chairman of the Fisher Center for Real Estate and Urban Economics at the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley. “We’re very early in the correction process. It’s going to take several years to play out, and we don’t know how deep it will be.”A five-year frenzy for San Francisco office space may be cooling as venture-capital investments decline and tech firms slow their hiring from a breakneck pace. The extra space is a warning sign that the growth rate for some companies was unsustainable, Rosen said. Some startups took more space than they needed in the hopes of expanding later, while others are moving to less-expensive areas or shifting staff to other buildings in the city.A pullback would be a marked shift for one of the hottest U.S. real estate markets. San Francisco had the lowest metropolitan office-vacancy rate at the end of last year, at 5.9%, according to CBRE Group (CBG). The San Francisco Bay area was No. 2 in the country for office investment in 2015, behind New York, the brokerage’s data show.“A lot of the startups aren’t doing as well as the money behind them would like them to do, so they’re cutting off the flow of funds for a number of these companies,” said Robert Sammons, regional director of research at Cushman & Wakefield in San Francisco. “These companies are having to make corrections in their business plans.”The largest share of space on the market is from companies that are contracting or consolidating, according to Cushman & Wakefield. As of the end of last year, about 55% was from the technology industry.An increase in subleasing preceded office-market downturns following the 2008 financial crisis and the dot-com bust in the late 1990s, said Colin Yasukochi, director of research and analysis at CBRE in San Francisco.The trend isn’t entirely negative. Some companies that leased space in the early stages of the boom can rent it out at a profit. Others may be expanding and moving into bigger offices, an indicator of growth.Subleasing also opens up more affordable space at a time when rents are near record highs. The space on the market for sublease has asking rents about 17% below those of regular leases, according to Cushman & Wakefield.“If you’re looking to move to San Francisco, the increase in subleasing availability is a sign that there’s still space available,” said Drew Murrell, citywide revenue manager in the division of budget and analysis at the San Francisco Controller’s Office.Twitter is subleasing 50,000 square feet at its 1355 Market St. headquarters, according to Matt Hart, executive managing director at Savills Studley, a tenant brokerage.A spokeswoman for Twitter declined to comment. The social-media company, which said in October that it would cut as much as 8% of its staff, has lost 67% of its market value in the past year.Companies such as Intuit are banking space that they’re renting with plans for expansion but don’t yet need. The software firm is subleasing two floors at 22 Fourth St. “that we have in our portfolio for future growth,” said spokeswoman Diane Carlini.Zenefits, which occupies four floors at 303 Second St., is subleasing space to move workers to adjacent floors, said Jessica Hoffman, a spokeswoman. The human-resources software startup, facing investigations over compliance with state rules, said last month that it would cut about 250 jobs.A big chunk of the subleasing space on the market comes from Charles Schwab (SCHW), which is subletting about 300,000 square feet as it combines its two San Francisco offices into one while boosting staff in other states, including Colorado and Texas, said Sarah Bulgatz, a spokeswoman for the financial-services firm.More than 1 million square feet in additional sublease space will likely be available this year, said Hart of Savills Studley. He said that he’s more concerned about a shift in tenant demand.“Many startups that were hiring 10 to 20 employees per month have adjusted to a net zero to three employees per month,” Hart said.Jobs in San Francisco’s tech industry, which includes Internet, software-publishing and data-hosting companies, increased by an annual rate of 5.1% in January, half the 10.5% growth in the same period the year before, according to Amar Mann, a regional economist at the Bureau of Labor Statistics.Anemic initial public offerings and falling valuations for some tech companies are leading to a decline in the early-stage investments that help fuel office demand. Venture-capital investments fell 32% in the fourth quarter from the previous three months to $11.3 billion, according to a January report from PricewaterhouseCoopers. Bay Area companies releasing IPOs dropped to 26 in 2015 from 35 the year before, Savills Studley data show.“We’re going to have a correction in the job market in San Francisco over the next several years,” said Berkeley’s Rosen. “We had an economy that was growing based on the availability of capital rather than the fundamental performance of some of the companies.""Related:More Commercial Investors Home In On Multifamily Sector, Study SaysChic Co-Working Spaces Now Drawing A Corporate CrowdCrowdfunding Tests NYC’s Commercial Property Market.

145,CBRE,"WeWork, the shared-office company valued at $15 billion, has cultivated a chic vibe to attract the freelancers and startup workers that helped launch the co-working movement. That means hip interior design (some offices have wallpaper created by the Beastie Boys' Mike D) and free micro-roasted coffee and craft beer (the company gave out 90,000 glasses during a single month last year).Now that youthful ambiance is helping attract the olds. General Electric (GE) moved 20 workers from its new energy business, Current, into a WeWork space near Boston's South Station this year as GE readies its new Boston headquarters. Other recent WeWork tenants include business consultancy KPMG, pharmaceutical giant Merck (MRK), and British news publication the Guardian -- companies that have been around for an average of 155 years.The moves mean traditional employers can rub shoulders with the young tech set. KPMG rents about 75 desks at a WeWork in Manhattan, which it splits between workers who provide business services to startups, and another team that advises corporate clients on technological innovation. Silicon Valley Bank (SIVB), which rents space at 16 co-working offices across the country, including with Galvanize in San Francisco and Centrl Office in Portland, Ore., says the move allows its bankers to work alongside the tech startups it courts as clients. “People literally open the door and say, 'We need to open [a] bank account,'” said Mark Gallagher, who leads the bank’s Boston technology practice.It's also a useful way to manage real estate costs, according to workplace strategy experts. “Anyone doing it now is a pioneer,” said Julie Whelan, head of occupier research for CBRE. “I can’t see that it won’t become a norm, based on how companies have worked to change their footprints in recent years.”It costs the typical U.S. company upward of $12,000 a year for each worker it provides office space, according to CBRE Group (CBG). Co-working spaces can be more expensive than traditional office space on a per-square-foot basis but make it easy for companies to move in and out, letting execs focus more on expanding their businesses than managing their real estate operations. ""If I go and find a space with a five-year lease and build it out, it might take me five years to recoup my expenses,"" said Brent Harrell, president of HeritageBank Mortgage, an Atlanta-based lender who recently moved a team of four mortgage bankers into an Industrious co-working space.Employees tend to like it, too. The homebuilder Lennar (LEN) rents space from Industrious in Chicago and Minneapolis so it can hold meetings near downtown construction projects and because the stylish offices help with recruiting, said Peter Chmielewski, vice president of development for the builder's multifamily arm. In a September report published in the Harvard Business Review, workers in shared offices reported that they were ""thriving"" so much that researchers “had to look at the data again.” The results, the researchers theorize, are largely because the workers tend to have a greater sense of purpose. They’ve opted into a workspace instead of showing up at a site designated by their employer, which tends to produce a community effect that makes them feel empowered.A stylish or flexible workplace doesn't necessarily require a co-working membership. Most employers are more comfortable adopting aspects of co-working than sending employees to shared offices, said Phil Kirschner, senior vice president at JLL (JLL), who consults with employers on workplace strategy. That could mean trading assigned desks for access to a variety of shared spaces. ""(They've) given up a desk and gained a floor,"" Kirschner said.Co-working companies, however, are welcoming the corporate interest. WeWork has raised $1 billion from investors to fuel expansion around the world, and renting space to large companies that need lots of desks is a good way to expand quickly. Thirty percent of WeWork's 45,000 members work for companies that rent more than 10 desks, and large employers make up its fastest-growing market. ""You’re going to see people dip toes in,"" said WeWork Chief Operating Officer Artie Minson. ""People go back to their drab, soulless office and say, I sort of wish I could have stayed there.""Serendipity Labs, which opened its first co-working space in Rye, N.Y., in 2013, says corporate employees make up 45% of members at its two U.S. locations, including workers from PepsiCo (PEP), Microsoft (MSFT), and Heineken International. The company is seeking to open 200 shared offices in the next three years, mostly in suburban locations, to appeal to companies with national footprints, founder John Arenas said. To fuel its rapid growth, Arenas is selling franchises to hotel operators and other hospitality companies. Not every corporate employer wants the kind of hip, downtown spaces associated with co-working, Arenas said.“Instead of having a bro-out Thursday night party, we’re having a Tesla test-driving event,” Arenas said. “We have different members. They can afford a car.”Related:Creative Offices Become The Norm And Get SmarterWhy Rental Rates At Biotech Labs Are SkyrocketingFood Feeds Real Estate Development In Edgy Areas

147,CBRE,"San Francisco's office market is famous for the number of tech companies gobbling up space. Leading the charge have been hometown favorites Salesforce.com (CRM) and Twitter (TWTR), as well as expanding Silicon Valley-based neighbors LinkedIn (LNKD) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL).Some 36% of all office stock in the Bay Area is occupied by tech firms, and they accounted for 60% of all office leasing activity in the first three quarters of 2015, said commercial real estate services giant CBRE Group (CBG) in a report published on Thursday.That strong demand for space has pushed office rents to ""near dot-com peaks"" and kept vacancies tight, CBRE said. San Francisco's office market benefited the most, with average asking rents growing 129% since early 2009, to $70 per square foot as of the third quarter.But with concerns swirling over further potential corrections in tech valuations, could San Francisco's booming tech-fueled office market be on the brink of a dot-com-like crash?Maybe not, but a high concentration of young tech outfits in late stages of venture-capital financing pose risks, CBRE said in its report, noting that those founded in the last 10 years take up nearly as much space as tech firms older than that.Riding Unicorns' FortunesConcerns are especially focused on their high valuations —$1 billion or more — and whether in the current slowing environment additional funding may dry up.As Colin Yasukochi, director of Bay-area research and analysis at CBRE, told IBD: ""If they receive less money, they will probably need fewer employees and less real estate. It could potentially have an impact on the office market in San Francisco Bay.""The tech industry has historically been volatile and cyclical. Any downturn would have an impact on the Bay Area,"" he added.And San Francisco would be the hardest hit. Citing research from venture-capital tracker CB Insights, CBRE says 40 of the 60 fast-growing Bay Area tech firms in late stages of private funding and valued at $1 billion or more — referred to as ""unicorns"" by venture capitalists — are in San Francisco.The Bay Area is host to nearly half of the 144 unicorn firms tracked nationally by CB Insights, the largest concentration in the U.S.""It's a big valuation for a private company,"" Yasukochi said of the $1 billion threshold. ""If the values are viewed as too high, it may be hard to raise additional funds. And it may be difficult to go public if valuations are higher than the public markets justify. And so the concern we have, from a real estate perspective, is how that impacts their growth and needs for additional real estate.""'There Is Concern'San Francisco's office real estate could feel the pinch in the next several months or quarters, he says.Of the 40 unicorns in San Francisco, ride-sharing company Uber Technologies holds the highest valuation, at $51 billion, followed by vacation rental's Airbnb at $25.5 billion, says CB Insights.Others highly valued are Pinterest at $11 billion and Dropbox at $10 billion.""It's not a comment on any specific company. Many of these companies are financially strong and doing well,"" Yasukochi said. ""It's just that the (venture capital and stock) markets are telling us that there is concern about these companies as a group.""San Francisco's 40 unicorns account for 16% of the city's tech-occupied space and 4.9% of overall office occupancy, CBRE says.Among other well-known tech outfits taking up space in San Francisco are Zynga (ZNGA), Yelp (YELP), Square (SQ) and Splunk (SPLK).

"
163,CBRE,"The way Hessam Nadji describes it, the apartment construction boom taking place in the U.S. is heavily tilted toward a select number of large urban markets such as New York, Los Angeles, Seattle, Houston and Denver.
"
164,CBRE,"About half of the 240,000 or so apartment units expected to be built this year are concentrated in 10 cities, says Nadji, senior executive vice president of real estate services provider Marcus & Millichap (MMI). The other half are spread over the rest of the country.
"
165,CBRE,"Anyone concerned that the feverish construction pace will eventually lead to an oversupply of apartment units is really talking about an oversupply of higher-end apartments in a relatively small collection of big cities, Nadji says.
"
166,CBRE,"""Some of the metro areas might be getting overbuilt, but the market as a whole is not getting overbuilt,"" he told IBD.
"
167,CBRE,"Why is this important to Nadji?
"
168,CBRE,"It's because his firm makes most of its money providing brokerage, advisory, financing and research services to clients in the apartment market — not just in big cities but throughout the U.S. and Canada.
"
169,CBRE,"Clients Small And Large
"
170,CBRE,"A bustling business in that sector has helped Marcus & Millichap deliver double-digit earnings growth and a stock price that touched a record high of 49.88 on Monday.
"
171,CBRE,"Although Marcus & Millichap also serves retail, office, industrial, hotel, self-storage, senior housing and other commercial real estate sectors, its No. 1 product is apartments. In that market, most of its work involves helping owners of apartment properties get the best bang for the buck when they are ready to sell.
"
172,CBRE,"About 90% of its revenue comes from comparatively small deals — those in the $1 million to $10 million range. The rest comes from $10 million to $20 million ""hybrid"" deals, where clients might include institutional investors and developers; and high-end deals of $25 million or more that mainly involve institutional clients, real estate investment trusts (REITs), foreign investors and pension funds.
"
173,CBRE,"In its core $1 million to $10 million market, Marcus & Millichap's clients are broken up pretty evenly between passive investors who work full-time jobs and professional investors.
"
174,CBRE,"""We dominate the private client segment of the commercial real estate market — passive investors who own commercial real estate on the side,"" Nadji said.
"
175,CBRE,"He reckons that Marcus & Millichap has a 12.5% to 13% share of the market for $1 million to $10 million apartment deals in the U.S. and that no other player has a double-digit share.

These deals don't involve the kinds of expensive luxury properties that you read about in San Francisco or Manhattan. But they do cover pretty much everything else in the rest of the U.S., from sprawling apartment complexes in suburban markets to quaint old brick buildings near downtown.

182,CBRE,"The company uses a combination of technology and research to create and analyze reports that reflect ""the most current and reliable inventory out there,"" he says. ""It ultimately ends up with us getting a listing to sell or refinance. We treat the whole business as a long-term, relationship-based model — getting to know the building and owner.""
"
183,CBRE,"Nadji's firm, along with plenty of others in commercial real estate, has benefited from a number of favorable macro and lifestyle trends.
"
184,CBRE,"""We have a positive market backdrop in terms of real estate fundamentals,"" he said. ""There was a gradual improvement from 2011 to '13 coming out of the recession, and it really picked up momentum in 2014.""
"
185,CBRE,"Meanwhile, more younger people — and even some older adults — are opting to rent in urban areas rather than buy homes in the suburbs the way they used to, he says.
"
186,CBRE,"""There's a demographic shift of young people who want to stay flexible and nimble, which means renting,"" Nadji said. ""There's also pent-up demand among older adults who prefer the urban lifestyle and are selling their homes to live closer to the center city.""
"
187,CBRE,"Another favorable trend is that developers are more savvy than they used to be regarding when and where to build properties, says Ron Witten, president of Witten Advisors, a Dallas-based apartment research and advisory firm.
"
188,CBRE,"""The industry's history has sensitized everyone to worry about overbuilding,"" he told IBD. ""At this point, there may be brief periods of oversupply, but the markets are pretty efficient now, and we certainly are not expected to see chronic overbuilding like we saw in decades past.""
"
189,CBRE,"Marcus & Millichap's financial results reflect these positive trends. Since its initial public offering in October 2013, the firm has grown year-over-year revenue at least 16% in each of its five full quarters as a publicly traded company. Earnings growth has been even more robust.
"
190,CBRE,"Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Marcus & Millichap to post full-year earnings of $1.65 a share for 2015, up 30% from the previous year. Earnings are seen rising 13% to $1.87 in 2016.

196,CBRE,"The overall growth in the commercial real estate market is expected to be modest, though steady as she goes.
"
197,CBRE,"""The commercial real estate market is on a positive, upward-trending environment across all property types,"" George Ratiu, director of quantitative and commercial research for the National Association of Realtors, told IBD. ""The economy continues to improve and more people are finding employment.""
"
198,CBRE,"Wages, adjusting for inflation, were up over 2% in the first quarter, he adds. He says the higher wage gains and job increases have helped lift consumer confidence.
"
199,CBRE,"""We're seeing a consumer environment that is more optimistic and has a little more disposable income,"" he said. ""That drives consumption, which indirectly drives commercial real estate. As consumers spend more, they tend to do so in retail stores.""
"
200,CBRE,"Ratiu says demand for retail space has been increasing and merchants have been more willing to open stores and expand.
"
201,CBRE,"As e-commerce spending picks up, he adds, and ""becomes more mainstream,"" there's been more demand for warehouse and distribution space, a trend that has resulted in the industrial sector being ""very healthy"" with declining vacancies.
"
202,CBRE,"Separately, the NAR released its forecast for the commercial real estate market on Tuesday.
"
203,CBRE,"Rent Outlook 2015-2016
"
204,CBRE,"It expects office rents will increase 3.4% this year and 3.7% in 2016. Average retail rents are expected to rise 2.6% this year and 3.1% in 2016. Annual industrial rents should rise 3.1% both this year and in 2016, the NAR estimates.
"
205,CBRE,"It expects national office vacancy rates to decrease 0.1% over the coming year as the demand for office space slowly improves. The vacancy rate for industrial space is seen as slipping 0.3% and the vacancy rate in the retail space is expected to fall 0.4% as ""manufacturing output increases and low gas prices and slight income gains boost consumer spending,"" the report said.
"
206,CBRE,"Commercial real estate tracker Reis (REIS) forecasts that asking rents in all three commercial sectors will rise nationally at a higher rate year-over-year in 2015 than in 2014 and 2013. It forecasts that office rates will rise the most, by 3.3% to $30.94 per square foot; retail rates will rise 2.5% to $20.18 per square foot; and industrial rates will increase 2.7% to $5.70 per square foot.
"
207,CBRE,"Still, Lawrence Yun, chief economist for the NAR, remains cautious: ""Commercial rents have risen at a moderate pace across the board for several quarters now and vacancy rates have been on a gradual decline. The commercial real estate sector is on the path to recovery, but subpar economic growth, lack of financing available to small investors and the industry trend towards squeezing more employees into existing spaces will keep demand from meaningful acceleration,"" he said in Tuesday's report.
"
208,CBRE,"He's more upbeat about the future. He expects the economy to ""slowly pick up in upcoming quarters after severe winter weather, a widening trade gap and port disputes on the West Coast dragged on gross domestic product growth in the first quarter,"" according to the NAR forecast.
"
209,CBRE,"""Similar to last year, economic growth will likely rebound as the year progresses, although perhaps not as robustly as what was seen in 2014,"" said Yun. ""However, as long as jobs are being added at a respectable pace, gradual increases in demand for commercial spaces and leasing projects should continue.""
"
210,CBRE,"Adds Ryan Severino, senior economist for Reis: ""If I had to describe the commercial real estate market, I would say it's getting better in the aggregate, but I wouldn't characterize it as being a strong market. There are pockets of strength in different properties and metro areas. But outside of apartments, we haven't had a major recovery in any of the major property types in general.""
"
211,CBRE,"He says that as long as the economy continues to recover and the labor market continues to improve, he sees ""no reason why rents should not continue to grow.""
"
212,CBRE,"The commercial real estate market's prospects bode well for CBRE Group (CBG) and JLL (JLL), the two largest companies by market cap in IBD's Real Estate-Development/Operations industry group.
"
213,CBRE,"For office space, the best markets, and clear ""outperformers,"" with the highest rents are Northern California and Seattle, says Severino.
"
214,CBRE,"Is High-End Retail Healthy?
"
215,CBRE,"In retail, he adds, the high end of the market is doing really well, a trend that's reflected at the metro level. Those markets with the highest rents and lowest vacancies are ""expensive coastal markets"" like the New York metro area and Northern and Southern California, he says.
"
216,CBRE,"""In every metro area we're looking at, prices continue to go up, pretty much across the board,"" added Rick Sharga, executive vice president at Auction.com. ""The one sector we're a little cautious about is the industrial sector.""
"
217,CBRE,"He says there may be a little ""weakness"" in the industrial sector because of the slowdown in energy production due to falling oil prices.
"
218,CBRE,"In the retail sector, new retail outlets tend to be smaller in terms of square footage, but they're not necessarily cheaper in terms of rent per square foot, Sharga says.
"
219,CBRE,"The basic drivers of higher rents in the office sector, he adds, are limited supply with little new construction and growing demand.
"
220,CBRE,"Markets with the lowest vacancy rates and highest rental rates in the industrial sector are markets with a lot of commercial trade and port traffic, such as Orange County, Calif., Los Angeles, Miami and Palm Beach, Fla., says Ratiu.
"
221,CBRE,"Office Space: A Trophy Room
"
222,CBRE,"Prime office space goes for a premium. According to JLL research, so-called ""trophy"" office rental rates have hit historic highs.
"
223,CBRE,"The trophy buildings are the premium office towers that make up the skylines in North American cities. They have architectural significance, are modern buildings of the highest quality and they capture the highest rents in the office space, Julia Georgules, vice president of office research at JLL, told IBD.
"
224,CBRE,"""Because these are the top buildings in a market, they generate the highest demand,"" she said. ""They set the tone as market movers, driving trends on both the occupier and investor side.""
"
225,CBRE,"They include the Empire State Building in New York and the Hyatt Center in Chicago.
"
226,CBRE,"Rental rates in the trophy buildings cost 77% more than the office space in other buildings in the skyline. In the first quarter, average rates in trophy buildings were $57.97 per square foot vs. $32.70 per square foot in other buildings, she says.
"
227,CBRE,"JLL expects the lack of availability for space in these buildings, amid high demand, to result in rental rates increasing at an annual rate of 15% to 18% by year-end 2015, says Georgules.
"
228,CBRE,"How are higher commercial real estate rents affecting existing tenants?
"
229,CBRE,"""Be prepared to experience some increased rental prices when your lease ends,"" said Sharga. ""It's still usually better for the landlord or building manager to keep good occupants than to have to re-market and supply new ones. Because the rent goes up, don't be afraid to ask for some improvements. That will make the value of the property to go up anyway. It's a tight market for tenants, especially in some of the hotter markets.""Driven by an improving economy and a now-brighter jobs picture, the commercial real estate market is expected to stay on the growth path with rents edging up and vacancy rates falling.Further lifting the prospects for higher rents are slightly higher wage gains, a boost for spending at retail, and a shrinking office-space supply.The overall growth in the commercial real estate market is expected to be modest, though steady as she goes.""The commercial real estate market is on a positive, upward-trending environment across all property types,"" George Ratiu, director of quantitative and commercial research for the National Association of Realtors, told IBD. ""The economy continues to improve and more people are finding employment.""Wages, adjusting for inflation, were up over 2% in the first quarter, he adds. He says the higher wage gains and job increases have helped lift consumer confidence.""We're seeing a consumer environment that is more optimistic and has a little more disposable income,"" he said. ""That drives consumption, which indirectly drives commercial real estate. As consumers spend more, they tend to do so in retail stores.""Ratiu says demand for retail space has been increasing and merchants have been more willing to open stores and expand.As e-commerce spending picks up, he adds, and ""becomes more mainstream,"" there's been more demand for warehouse and distribution space, a trend that has resulted in the industrial sector being ""very healthy"" with declining vacancies.Separately, the NAR released its forecast for the commercial real estate market on Tuesday.Rent Outlook 2015-2016It expects office rents will increase 3.4% this year and 3.7% in 2016. Average retail rents are expected to rise 2.6% this year and 3.1% in 2016. Annual industrial rents should rise 3.1% both this year and in 2016, the NAR estimates.It expects national office vacancy rates to decrease 0.1% over the coming year as the demand for office space slowly improves. The vacancy rate for industrial space is seen as slipping 0.3% and the vacancy rate in the retail space is expected to fall 0.4% as ""manufacturing output increases and low gas prices and slight income gains boost consumer spending,"" the report said.Commercial real estate tracker Reis (REIS) forecasts that asking rents in all three commercial sectors will rise nationally at a higher rate year-over-year in 2015 than in 2014 and 2013. It forecasts that office rates will rise the most, by 3.3% to $30.94 per square foot; retail rates will rise 2.5% to $20.18 per square foot; and industrial rates will increase 2.7% to $5.70 per square foot.Still, Lawrence Yun, chief economist for the NAR, remains cautious: ""Commercial rents have risen at a moderate pace across the board for several quarters now and vacancy rates have been on a gradual decline. The commercial real estate sector is on the path to recovery, but subpar economic growth, lack of financing available to small investors and the industry trend towards squeezing more employees into existing spaces will keep demand from meaningful acceleration,"" he said in Tuesday's report.He's more upbeat about the future. He expects the economy to ""slowly pick up in upcoming quarters after severe winter weather, a widening trade gap and port disputes on the West Coast dragged on gross domestic product growth in the first quarter,"" according to the NAR forecast.""Similar to last year, economic growth will likely rebound as the year progresses, although perhaps not as robustly as what was seen in 2014,"" said Yun. ""However, as long as jobs are being added at a respectable pace, gradual increases in demand for commercial spaces and leasing projects should continue.""Adds Ryan Severino, senior economist for Reis: ""If I had to describe the commercial real estate market, I would say it's getting better in the aggregate, but I wouldn't characterize it as being a strong market. There are pockets of strength in different properties and metro areas. But outside of apartments, we haven't had a major recovery in any of the major property types in general.""He says that as long as the economy continues to recover and the labor market continues to improve, he sees ""no reason why rents should not continue to grow.""The commercial real estate market's prospects bode well for CBRE Group (CBG) and JLL (JLL), the two largest companies by market cap in IBD's Real Estate-Development/Operations industry group.For office space, the best markets, and clear ""outperformers,"" with the highest rents are Northern California and Seattle, says Severino.Is High-End Retail Healthy?In retail, he adds, the high end of the market is doing really well, a trend that's reflected at the metro level. Those markets with the highest rents and lowest vacancies are ""expensive coastal markets"" like the New York metro area and Northern and Southern California, he says.""In every metro area we're looking at, prices continue to go up, pretty much across the board,"" added Rick Sharga, executive vice president at Auction.com. ""The one sector we're a little cautious about is the industrial sector.""He says there may be a little ""weakness"" in the industrial sector because of the slowdown in energy production due to falling oil prices.In the retail sector, new retail outlets tend to be smaller in terms of square footage, but they're not necessarily cheaper in terms of rent per square foot, Sharga says.The basic drivers of higher rents in the office sector, he adds, are limited supply with little new construction and growing demand.Markets with the lowest vacancy rates and highest rental rates in the industrial sector are markets with a lot of commercial trade and port traffic, such as Orange County, Calif., Los Angeles, Miami and Palm Beach, Fla., says Ratiu.Office Space: A Trophy RoomPrime office space goes for a premium. According to JLL research, so-called ""trophy"" office rental rates have hit historic highs.The trophy buildings are the premium office towers that make up the skylines in North American cities. They have architectural significance, are modern buildings of the highest quality and they capture the highest rents in the office space, Julia Georgules, vice president of office research at JLL, told IBD.""Because these are the top buildings in a market, they generate the highest demand,"" she said. ""They set the tone as market movers, driving trends on both the occupier and investor side.""They include the Empire State Building in New York and the Hyatt Center in Chicago.Rental rates in the trophy buildings cost 77% more than the office space in other buildings in the skyline. In the first quarter, average rates in trophy buildings were $57.97 per square foot vs. $32.70 per square foot in other buildings, she says.JLL expects the lack of availability for space in these buildings, amid high demand, to result in rental rates increasing at an annual rate of 15% to 18% by year-end 2015, says Georgules.How are higher commercial real estate rents affecting existing tenants?""Be prepared to experience some increased rental prices when your lease ends,"" said Sharga. ""It's still usually better for the landlord or building manager to keep good occupants than to have to re-market and supply new ones. Because the rent goes up, don't be afraid to ask for some improvements. That will make the value of the property to go up anyway. It's a tight market for tenants, especially in some of the hotter markets.""

246,CBRE,"When it comes to providing financial services to the commercial real estate industry, HFF has been on a winning streak. Through its subsidiaries, Holliday Fenoglio Fowler and HFF Securities, HFF (HF) provides commercial real estate and capital markets services to both the users and providers of capital in the commercial real estate sector.The company offers clients a fully integrated national capital markets platform including debt placement, investment sales, equity placement, investment banking and advisory services, loan sales and commercial loan servicing. It operates out of 22 offices around the U.S. and has 732 associates, including 286 transaction professionals.Its clients are owners of various property types, including offices, retail, industrial, senior living and multihousing properties.Among its recent transactions is the acquisition financing for the purchase of 12 apartment communities totaling 4,635 units in Texas, Georgia and Colorado.Working on behalf of the borrower, Strata Equity Group, HFF placed 12 separate fixed-rate loans totaling $494.88 million with Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.'s Capital Markets Execution Program.Property Is HotHFF has been cashing in on the growing demand for its services as the commercial real estate market keeps up its strong momentum in terms of sales and investments.It has logged at least double-digit earnings growth in all but one of the past eight quarters. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect it to keep up the double-digit-growth streak for the 2015 full year.Why the strong gains? Analysts see a number of growth drivers.""The number of transactions in commercial real estate continues to grow at a healthy clip,"" William Blair analyst Brandon Dobell told IBD. ""More and more buildings are being sold every year and the building values are also rising. Commercial real estate as an asset class continues to attract institutional capital. Pension funds, life insurance companies, endowments, private equity (and others) over the past 10 years have gradually increased their allocations of money they manage to commercial real estate.""Dobell says the long-term trend of money managers increasing their allocations to commercial real estate has been ""amplified"" in the past four or five years by the economic recovery.He says that as the economy has recovered property fundamentals including rents and occupancy rates have gradually improved in the commercial real estate sector, while low interest rates and a healthy credit market have made it easier for borrowers to finance or refinance property transactions.Adds George Ratiu, director of quantitative and commercial research for the National Association of Realtors: ""Investors have been hungry for commercial properties for several reasons. One is the fact that with economic fundamentals improving, prospects for commercial building is improving.""Capital availability has seen a solid rebound from the lows of the financial crisis and there are a lot more players in the capital markets,"" he said. ""With a full spectrum of capital originators back in the market, there's significantly more capital available. That's driven investment sales higher.""Productivity ImprovingDobell says that HFF has been ""taking market share"" in a growing commercial real estate market by continuing to grow its head count and increasing the ""productivity"" of their transaction professionals.HFF, he adds, has been growing the number of associates by about 10% a year over the past several years through a combination of recruiting and internal promotions.And the productivity of the individual brokers has been improving for a long time, he says, which helps generate more transactions and more revenue every year and illustrates that HFF's focus on providing a relatively narrow range of services is generating repeat customers and referrals.Hiring 'Producers'JMP Securities analyst Mitch Germain says a ""significant amount"" of the company's growth is tied to hiring. He estimates it has hired over 100 ""producers"" over the last four years.HFF's competitors include the CBRE Capital Markets arm of CBRE Group (CBG) — the world's largest commercial real estate services and investment firm — and commercial real estate services firm JLL (JLL).""What's unique about HFF is they don't lease assets and are not a landlord,"" said Germain.HFF's services include debt placement, in which it offers clients access to a complete range of debt instruments, including construction and construction/mini-permanent loans, as well as adjustable- and fixed-rate mortgages.It also provides investment sales services to commercial real estate owners who are looking to sell one or more properties or property interests.Through its licensed broker-dealer subsidiary HFF Securities, it offers private equity, investment banking and advisory services.""Part of the reason they're successful is they've stayed very true to what they want to do,"" adds Dobell. ""They don't sway from doing one thing very well, which is transaction advisory.""HFF boasts a high retention rate for its senior transaction professionals, who have an average tenure of 12.8 years. The average production tenure for the top 25 senior transaction professionals, compiled by initial leads during the last five years, was 14.8 years, according to the company's 2014 year-end filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.""Substantially"" all of HFF's revenue is in the form of capital markets services fees that are collected from clients, usually negotiated on a transaction-by-transaction basis, the filing says. It also earns fees from commercial loan-servicing activities.HFF turned out an impressive first quarter. Earnings surged 150% from a year earlier to 25 cents a share, sailing past consensus views. Revenue jumped 24% to $94.3 million.Debt placement production volume soared 49% from a year earlier to $7.84 billion. Investment sales production volume increased 19.1% to $5.61 billion. Loan sales popped 599% to $255.6 million.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters see full-year 2015 earnings climbing 24% to $1.99 a share. They expect a 10% gain in 2016.""I expect the improving economy will continue to drive growth in the commercial real estate markets,"" said Ratiu.HFF stock has risen 14% since the start of the year.What's the draw for investors?""People recognize this is a relatively straightforward way to invest in the ongoing growth in commercial real estate,"" said Dobell. ""From a company-specific perspective, investors believe these guys run the company well. They're good at what they do and they put the customer first, which keeps customers loyal, and when they have too much cash on the balance sheet they give it back in the form of a dividend to shareholders.""Dobell says employees own about 25% of the company's shares.HFF is a part of IBD's Finance-Mortgage & Real Estate Services industry group. It leads the group with an IBD Composite Rating of 96 out of a possible 99. The group also includes Essent Group (ESNT), which has a Composite Rating of 95, and CoreLogic (CLGX) — the group's largest name by market cap — with a Composite Rating of 92.

247,CBRE,"The regulator of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae plans to ease annual restrictions on their apartment mortgage business to prevent a lending slowdown, according to two people familiar with the matter.
"
248,CBRE,"The government-controlled companies, which buy and guarantee mortgages, are on track to reach a $30 billion annual cap in their multifamily business in the third quarter. The Federal Housing Finance Agency intends to tell the companies this week how it will loosen the limits it set in January, the two sources said.Without an easing of the restrictions, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FMCC) could have to hold back business in the second half of the year, resulting in higher costs to borrowers and less available multifamily credit. Fannie might also have to slow sales of loans to investors. The firms have begun demanding wider interest rate spreads in an attempt to reduce their pace of business.""Our sense is that the current situation is unsustainable as the lack of market clarity will ultimately have an impact on multifamily credit availability,"" said Isaac Boltansky, a policy analyst at Compass Point Research & Trading.Housing officials in the last month discussed several options for relaxing limits, including raising caps by $5 billion for each firm, said one of the sources, and they have considered broadening criteria to exempt more mortgages from the limit.FHFA spokeswoman Stefanie Johnson declined to comment.Lending SurgeFannie and Freddie's apartment business surged fourfold through April from a year ago, spurred by low interest rates and rental-unit demand. Freddie financed $10 billion in multifamily loans in Q1, just behind rival Fannie with $10.4 billion.The FHFA would be in uncharted territory if it makes changes to the mortgage limits midyear rather than in January, said Lisa Pendergast, an analyst at Jefferies Group.""It would be unusual for them to think about raising the caps now, but on the other hand, by summer, they could hit the ceiling,"" she said. ""They may have to shut down origination if that happens.""Increasing RatesFannie and Freddie began tapping the brakes by boosting their costs of borrowing, which may cause business to move to private lenders, says Willy Walker, CEO at Walker & Dunlop (WD), one of the firms' biggest multifamily lending partners.""Freddie and Fannie got ahead of themselves, and now they're trying to temper themselves by raising their rates,"" Walker said.Freddie increased the cost on its 10-year mortgage four times in April, according to Walker & Dunlop data. Freddie's floating-rate loan cost 62 basis points more by the end of the month, the firm said.Fannie also made its loans more expensive. Spreads on its 10-year mortgage rose a total of 45 basis points in late March through April.Commercial mortgage lending is booming as demand for rental units fuels multifamily construction. Total lending surged 49% in Q1 from last year, according to Mortgage Bankers Association data. Multifamily mortgages lifted 71%.""Everyone in this market will do more this year,"" Jeffery Hayward, head of multifamily lending at Fannie Mae, said in an interview.CBRE Group (CBG) said last week that the firm's multifamily lending backed by the agencies has been robust. CBRE CFO James Groch warned on the company's April earnings call that business could taper off toward the end of the year unless the caps are raised.A slowdown in multifamily agency mortgages would be a positive development for the private market, according to Lea Overby, an analyst at Nomura Holdings.

259,CBRE,"Growth investors should seek to buy stocks in the early stages of their advances, but buying soon after an initial public offering carries risks.IBD research shows that the market's biggest winners racked up much of their gains not long after going public, such as Google (GOOGL) did soon after its IPO of August 2004. That's because companies with new products, services or technologies tend to have their best periods of growth in their earlier years.But usually it pays to wait a bit, because most stocks retreat after an initial post-IPO spike. Facebook's (FB) stock jumped and tumbled after its May 2012 IPO, with investors having to suffer through a 15-month correction before the stock got back to its IPO price of 38 a share.The lesson? Wait for the IPO to consolidate and build a base.Normally, a proper base takes a minimum of five weeks to form.But IPO bases can be shorter than normal and more volatile than normal.CBRE Group (CBG), a property manager and loan originator for commercial real estate, went public on June 10, 2004, and began forming an IPO base in early August.The buy point was at 20.10, or 10 cents above the left-side high of a three-week base that featured tight trading, with weekly ranges of less than 10%.The calm trading was unusual for a new issue and gave the base some constructive action.The stock cleared the buy point Sept. 3 in heavy volume. In the next five months it sped up its 10-week line, pausing along the way to shape a series of bases.It hit a peak of 42.74 three years later, in the week ended July 20, 2007, representing a gain of 631%.At the time of its breakout, CBRE's fundamentals were weak but improving, as is the case with many new stocks that have little track record.But investors who looked at IBD's industry group rankings would have sensed that something was happening, as the real estate operations group had jumped to No. 6 out of 197 from 91 in just six weeks. This was the early stages of the property boom that sent CBRE and many other real estate stocks soaring.For more on IPO stocks, see IBD's IPO Analysis column, which appears every Tuesday and Thursday and features stocks that have gone public in the past three years.These stocks are selected from a computer-generated screen that picks out the best new issues based on key fundamental and technical criteria.

"
286,CBRE,"In the commercial real estate recovery, the U.S. office market has lagged other sectors such as apartments and industrial.But it has been rebounding as the economy improves and adds jobs. A lot of the strength has been driven by high tech. Where tech companies are on the move, office fundamentals are strengthening.Take San Francisco. Twitter (TWTR) was one of the first in. And with new space being taken by tech companies such as Salesforce.com (CRM), Dropbox and Splunk (SPLK), among others, the city has become one of the strongest U.S. office markets.Commercial real estate brokerage Marcus & Millichap (MMI) ranks it No. 1 on its National Office Property Index for 2015, a forward-looking survey released this week.The index sorts markets by improvements expected in 2015 based on factors such as new office supply, employment growth, and vacancies and absorption.Close behind San Francisco are tech hot spots San Jose, Calif., and Seattle, which bumped New York for third place due largely to Amazon's (AMZN) expansion in its hometown. San Jose kept its No. 2 spot as tech firms such as Google (GOOGL) and LinkedIn (LNKD) continue to take up huge blocks of space in the area.""The tech markets are absolutely holding their strength, no doubt about it,"" said Alan Pontius, national director of commercial property groups at Marcus & Millichap. ""Tech is not limited to Silicon Valley/San Jose at this point.""U.S. office leasing activity is increasingly focused in the high-tech sector, concurs commercial real estate services giant CBRE Group (CBG).Tech Takes 1 Of 5 Big LeasesIn CBRE's latest office-market study, also out this week, it noted that high tech accounted for 19% of the largest U.S. lease transactions in 2014, up from 13.6% in 2013.""What jumps out to me is how much market share high tech has taken for leasing activity,"" said Sara Rutledge, CBRE's research and analysis director.She says high tech has become an important driver in rising office-market fundamentals in ""all regions"" of the country.""In the Midwest, high tech accounted for 14% of the leasing activity in 2014,"" she said, making tech the No. 2 leasing sector there after health care and life sciences.While Marcus & Millichap sees San Francisco's office market improving most this year, Pontius views it also as ""absolutely the best"" office market in America today.""Supply and demand fundamentals are simply the strongest,"" he said. ""You're talking about the U.S. capital for technology.""Marcus & Millichap notes that tech firms now occupy significant space in San Francisco's financial district along with South of Market, the Mission District and South Beach area. Salesforce recently committed to 710,000 square feet in the renamed Salesforce Tower in the South of Market district, it noted.Office-using sectors added 407,100 jobs in the U.S. in 2014, a 2.4% gain over 2013, to 17.2 million, says CBRE. It's 2 million more office jobs than at 2009's cyclical low.They're not all high tech, of course. ""Both employment and leasing activity is broadening to other office-using services such as financial services and other business services,"" Rutledge said.CBRE says Los Angeles and Dallas/Fort Worth each saw more than 40,000 new office jobs last year, in varied fields.According to Marcus & Millichap's office report, six Florida markets show improving strength this year. Miami moved up the index four places to No. 7, and Tampa-St. Petersburg six notches to No. 24. Other rising office markets include West Palm Beach, Orlando, Fort Lauderdale and Jacksonville.The reason: little new office construction has occurred in the Sunshine State in more than five years, while population growth and homebuilding has outpaced the national average, Pontius says.""You're seeing a pickup in office demand with no pickup in supply,"" he said. Retirees and other newcomers ""need services,"" he said, such as health care, legal, insurance, mortgages and banking.Nationwide, net absorption of office space in 2014 — some 52.7 million square feet — was the highest since 2007, CBRE noted. But CBRE expects that rate to moderate over the next few years to around 42 million square feet annually, closer to the historic average.Space Race: Use Less Of It Besides coming off a high mark in 2014, another reason may be the secular trend in the way office space is designed and used.""Demand is positive but users of office space tend to use less space per worker than they used to,"" said Jeanette Rice, CBRE's head of Americas investment research.Even with that dynamic, CBRE says, demand for office space nationwide is outpacing supply, which means vacancy rates will continue to fall, pushing rents up.Office vacancies in 2014 reached their lowest level since 2008, CBRE said, ending the year at 13.9%. The lowest vacancy rate in the U.S. was in Manhattan's Midtown South area, at 5.5%, followed by downtown San Francisco at 6.6%.Manhattan, home of Wall Street and a center for financial services, has also attracted lots of tech companies in expansion mode, such as Google and Amazon. Samsung plans to lease as much as 1 million square feet of additional space, Marcus & Millichap notes.Amid lackluster government employment, Washington, D.C. dropped two rungs in Marcus & Millichap's 2015 office index. More than 20% of the D.C. metro area's office stock will sit empty this year, Marcus & Millichap said.Energy capital Houston also is coming under pressure, but for another reason: the steep fall in oil prices and its impact on local employment at a time when a lot of new office supply is entering the market.There's no doubt oil's drop creates ""a degree of pause,"" said Pontius. So far this year in Houston, 1.3 million square feet of existing office space has been put on the market for subleasing, Rutledge of CBRE says. That brings available office sublease space to 2.7% of the total office market. At that point, it ""starts to impact the overall rental rate (downwards),"" she said.Despite new office supply in some markets, such as Houston, San Francisco, San Jose and New York, very little new office supply is expected nationwide. New office construction nationwide will amount to no more than 1% of existing office supply, Pontius says.""That is statistically almost nothing,"" he said. ""So you have time for the demand side to impact absorption and leasing. We expect a rising trendline on the demand side as the job market continues to expand.""

287,CBRE,"When the National Association of Realtors begins tallying its 2015 study data on how much money international homebuyers spend in the U.S., one thing you can likely bet on is that China will widen its lead vs. the rest of the world.You can also expect a rise in the prices that foreign buyers pay, experts say, as well as more international investment outside of the usual gateway cities New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Miami and Washington, D.C.China will be the center of attention when the NAR starts tallying its 2015 survey, which spans the 12 months ending in March.Although Canada ranks first in terms of the number of purchases involving U.S. homes by international buyers, China took the lead in dollar volume a couple years ago and continues to expand its lead.It's not just the residential real estate market where China has become a top player. Chinese investors also have made a big move in commercial real estate developments such as office buildings, medical facilities and tech centers.""The investments from China are exponentially increasing each year in terms of real estate. It's very much a growing trend,"" said Scott Picken, founder and CEO of Wealth Migrate, an online global real estate investment marketplace.That's certainly been the case in terms of U.S. homes purchased by Chinese investors. The NAR estimates that Chinese investors spent about $22 billion on U.S. homes in its 2014 study (which covers the 12 months through March 2014), or roughly 24% of the total dollars spent by international buyers. It was up from $12.8 billion and 19% a year earlier in the 2013 study.Snowbirds Stock UpIn contrast, Canada ranked second in both dollars spent and market share. Its numbers were $13.8 billion and 15%, respectively, in the 2014 study vs. $11.8 billion and 17% in the 2013 study.China's lead in dollars spent should widen more when the NAR begins tallying 2015 study data this spring, says Jed Smith, the NAR's managing director for quantitative research. The group's yearly profile of international homebuying activity is usually published in June.""The country making the move up the ladder is China, and it has been moving up considerably. We expect that to continue,"" Smith told IBD. ""Canada is leading in terms of the number of transactions, but China is a close second.""In the number of transactions by international buyers, Canada ranked first in 2014 with 19% of the total vs. 16% for China. But Canada's lead is narrowing. In 2013, Canada accounted for 23% of total transactions vs. 12% for China.Why Chinese, Canadians BuyMany Canadians buy vacation or retirement homes in Florida and Arizona, Smith says. Those markets tend to be less pricey than the large urban markets that Chinese investors prefer — primarily Los Angeles, the San Francisco Bay Area, greater New York and Washington, D.C.Canadians often put down stakes for the long haul, but many Chinese investors take a shorter-term view.""The Chinese buy for a variety of reasons, and those reasons are increasing,"" Smith said. ""In addition to investment and diversification of assets, they are increasingly buying for educational reasons. Many are buying houses for kids who go to school here. They will rent out some of the rooms to others, then eventually sell the properties after the kids graduate.""The NAR notes that more than half of international homebuying activity in the U.S. is in five states: Florida, California, Arizona, Texas and New York. Arizona, Florida and Texas tend to draw the lion's share of Canadians and Latin Americans. New York and California draw the most Asians and Europeans.International buyers account for about 4% of all houses bought in the U.S. each year, Smith says, but 7% of the total value of the market.""They tend to buy upscale,"" he said. ""The overall market for international buyers is under $100 billion a year, but that's still a lot of money, and they buy about 200,000 houses — which is an awful lot .""The international customer base is particularly attractive for real estate firms with operations in big gateway cities — homebuilders such as Lennar (LEN), KB Home (KBH) and Toll Bros. (TOL), and commercial property firms such as CBRE Group (CBG) and Jones Lang LaSalle (JLL).Smaller Cities Make The MapAt the same time, one of the recent trends — particularly in commercial real estate — is an influx of international cash into other cities, Wealth Migrate's Picken says.""America has been a major focus for individual players, and in the past they mainly tended to go to Tier 1 cities like New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Miami,"" he told IBD. ""But now we are seeing a lot of investments in other places — like Atlanta, Houston, Dallas, Charlotte, Memphis, even Oklahoma.""There has also been a lot of investment in Detroit, Picken says, mainly because international investors can grab up some prime real estate at cheap prices. That's not the case in other markets, however.""The property values in many parts of America are back to where they were pre-crash,"" Picken said. ""But you are still seeing a rise in interest from international buyers because prices are still so much higher in places like London and Sydney than they are in the U.S. You can still get good value in America.""Medical buildings have become particularly popular among international investors because, he says, ""doctors don't move — you have a lot more stability in terms of leases.""In the residential market, the amount of money that international investors are spending reflects a rise in U.S. home prices. The median purchase price of U.S. homes by international buyers was $268,000 in the NAR's 2014 study. It was up from $226,000 the prior year. Smith expects another rise for 2015.""The preliminary indications are that the amount of international activity is about the same this year as last year. But prices are up, so that would impact the value ,"" he said.

"
318,CBRE,"Stamina is the ability to sustain performance at or near peak levels. It comes from understanding when to downshift, conserve energy and enable consistent performance over long distances or time periods.Stocks nearing the end of rallies often show signs of waning stamina.Like a runner whose pace slackens and whose form erodes, stocks may begin to flash sell signs — warnings that they are about to downshift. One prevailing sign is when a stock hits a new high in weak volume.New highs in weak volume tell you that the stock has little investor conviction and little, if any, institutional support for a continued advance. It can also be a tough signal to read. The moves generally come interspersed with some high-volume gains, and there is a bit of an art to determining what your stock is trying to say.Fortunately, sell signals rarely happen in isolation. If you see a stock making new highs in weak trade, study the chart for other signs of trouble.You can't expect strong trade on every uptick. But several instances of the weak volume constitute fair warning, especially if the stock has climbed seven or more days in a row (following a long advance) and is logging wide weekly price spreads, or if it has pierced above its upper channel line.Commercial real estate leader CBRE Group (CBG) put the finishing touches on an orderly run-up in April 2011. The stock staged multiple breakouts during 2009 and 2010. The last major breakout cleared a cup-with-handle base in September 2010. Shares posted multiple tests of support at the 50-day moving average in the four months through January.The stock then vectored higher, pulling away from its 50-day line at just about the same time that the general market began pulling back into a mild consolidation.At a time like this, if you have a healthy gain in the stock and you don't want it to evaporate, scour the stock's chart for additional sell signs. Is it late-stage? Is it showing wild action or weak rebounds after multiple pullbacks to the 10-week line? Is it flashing climax top behavior? Is it seeing rising volume on down days and/or weeks?In your search for clues, toggle back and forth between the weekly and daily charts. And watch other leaders in the stock's industry group and sector. If they're under pressure, they amplify any warnings that your stock might be sending.CBRE was a hard case. It logged just enough strong-volume gains to keep you guessing. On the downside, it saw some selling volume, but it never broke below critical levels of support.The market did provide some supporting evidence for the sell signals. IBD shifted the market's status to ""uptrend under pressure"" on Feb. 22, just as CBRE began logging new highs in light trade (1). The market's status slipped into a brief correction on March 8.After a follow-through launched a new uptrend at the end of the month, all of CBRE's gains came in weak trade (2). You probably still would not have sold at this point. But you would have had fair warning. When volume picked up along with heavy losses near the end of April (3), the time to pull the ripcord was nigh.

320,CBRE,"A good stock idea isn't much use if you don't understand what you're looking at. Is it an institutional-quality stock? Is it a cyclical play that probably will only profit from its industry cycle? Is it a turnaround story that involves the fixing of a company problem? Is it a fad stock that will run hot until people tire of the novelty?
"
321,CBRE,"The strategy and target will differ for each of these situations, and it will vary by the kind of uptrend the market is in.Peg the stock wrong or the market wrong, and you will probably lose money or at least make less than you should.If an investor is going to make big money, institutional-quality stocks, operating in a strong uptrend, will most often be the investor's best choice. However, there are times when a cyclical stock, turnaround or fad stock can deliver good gains.Where can an investor find or identify great stock ideas? Your Weekly Review (YWR), also known as the 85-85 list, is a good place to look in Friday's IBD.In this screen, stocks must score an 85 in EPS Rating and in Relative Price Strength Rating. The 85 means that the stocks must be in the top 15 percentile among stocks in IBD's database. Stocks also must be within 15% of a 12-month high.Charts are listed by industry group, but charts aren't printed for every stock. Additional stocks are listed in the fine-print listing on the last page of YWR, today on A8.The big net makes the 85-85 a good place to look for stock ideas. A low-hurdle screen will pick up more cyclicals, turnarounds and fad stocks than a high-hurdle screen.Some people sneer at ""fad stocks."" They argue that such stocks are dangerous, won't last and aren't for serious investors.Well, all stocks are dangerous. While fad stocks might have a shorter life, sometimes all we're talking about is a solid company indirectly benefiting from a fad.For example, egg producer and distributor Cal-Maine Foods (CALM) rode the Atkins diet to big stock gains in 2003.In other cases, fads develop into longer-lasting trends.For instance, Deckers Outdoor (DECK) bought UGG Holdings in August 1995 and eventually turned the Ugg boots — once popular mostly with surfers — into a broader fashion trend.From October 2002 to October 2011, Deckers Outdoors shares rose 9,193%, with Uggs deserving much of the credit.How might the 85-85 be used?Let's look at the 85-85 screen that was published in IBD on Oct. 24, 2014, not long after a market low and the Oct. 21 follow-through day. A follow-through day soon after a market low is often the best time to scout for breakouts, retaking of buy points and bounces off the 10-week moving average, as seen in the minicharts.An investor could've found five institutional-quality stocks in the 85-85 that soon set valid entries: Apple (AAPL), Celgene (CELG), Ulta Beauty (ULTA), Illumina (ILMN) and Skyworks (SWKS). Gains varied from 15% to 79%.Four cyclicals in the 85-85 eventually offered entries: Landstar System (LSTR), Old Dominion Freight Line (ODFL), FedEx (FDX) and Lennar (LEN). Gains ran from 11% to 15%.Turnarounds and fads were scarce.The market itself was and had been choppy, which is why taking a 10% to 15% profit in Apple was prudent.

"
347,CBRE,"The fast-moving boom in unconventional gas and oil production has altered the pipelines sector, once a slow-changing, utility-grade investment. New pipelines are being built and existing lines reversed to serve an evolving map of opportunities.
"
348,CBRE,"A large share of those lines has come under ownership of master limited partnerships (MLPs), a tax-advantaged business model luring income investors with large cash distributions, much like dividends.
"
349,CBRE,"In August, early MLP adopter Kinder Morgan Energy Partners (KMP) abandoned the business model in order to gain more financial and operational flexibility. Hinds Howard, a vice president and assistant portfolio manager at CBRE Clarion Securities and a long-time specialist in the MLP space, discusses the causes behind Kinder Morgan's move, the ripple effects upon other MLPs and the general status of the MLP sector.
"
350,CBRE,"IBD: What were some of the reasons behind Kinder Morgan shedding its MLP format?
"
351,CBRE,"Hinds Howard: The problem was that they had grown so much so fast. For many years, they were the fastest-growing MLP out there in terms of distribution per unit. The way MLPs are restructured is: the faster you grow your distribution per unit, the faster you run up the ladder of the set of distribution rights (to the general partner).
"
352,CBRE,"KMP had grown so much from such a small base that the GP, Kinder Morgan Inc. (KMI), was receiving 44% of all cash distributions. So in order for KMP to grow its distribution $1, it had to make $2 of distributable cash flow — and that's a problem.
"
353,CBRE,"IBD: So how does that compare to other MLPs out there? Are there others at risk of being forced to make the same sort of move?
"
354,CBRE,"Howard: There are other MLPs that will eventually have that problem, but it was compounded at the KMP level because KMP was so big. Kinder Morgan bought a $5 billion company (Copano, in May 2013), and it didn't move the needle at all. If you are doing $5 billion acquisitions that don't have much of an impact, it can be really hard to grow.
"
355,CBRE,"(Among other MLPs,) Plains All American (PAA) may be the closest; maybe they are around 40% in terms of cash that goes to the GP. But nobody is close to the 45% cash to the GP that Kinder was. (Plains' distribution/dividend yield is near 4.4%, vs. 5.8% for Kinder Morgan.)
"
356,CBRE,"Enterprise Products Partners (EPD) had the same problem (as KMP). They solved it by buying their GP, by internalizing it, several years ago. Other MLPs have also done that: Magellan Midstream (MMP), Buckeye Partners (BPL)...
"
357,CBRE,"IBD: Will the KMI/KMP restructuring have any impact on the MLP space?
"
358,CBRE,"Howard: Yes, it will. It will have an impact on the indexes (that track MLPs) and on the funds that flow into the sector. Another factor is that a lot of the KMP unit holders were investors from early on who had such a low (cost) basis in their stock. So people that ordinarily would never have sold their Kinder Morgan are now being forced to sell. They will face huge tax consequences, and they will be forced to go out and find a new place for their capital.
"
359,CBRE,"(The KMP/KMI restructuring) is bullish for the sector just from a technical standpoint.
"
360,CBRE,"In terms of indexes and people who can sell their units and move on to another MLP, and just the way Kinder is talking about buying other MLPs — (all this) will have a positive impact on the sector.
"
361,CBRE,"IBD: So, beyond Kinder Morgan, where does the MLP space stand at this point? Is it maturing?
"
362,CBRE,"Howard: We've never had as much visibility in terms of distribution growth as we have now. MLPs are less and less reliant on acquiring other companies — on these crapshoot M&A auction processes. They are more and more reliant on clear and visible production growth, and you have several years of cap ex plans to look at.
"
363,CBRE,"So you can see more clearly now than you could in the past that distributions are going to be sustainable at a higher rate for longer. What that means is that is starting to get priced in. People are more and more comfortable with MLPs, as a sector, growing 6% to 8% a year.
"
364,CBRE,"So their multiples are going up. That means it's getting harder and harder to find value in the sector, but fundamentally things are moving in the right direction.
"
365,CBRE,"IBD: What is your outlook here? How should investors moving into MLPs in the coming year look at the space?
"
366,CBRE,"Howard: In general, the MLPs that will do fine are the ones that are already at premiums. Those will continue to grow. But some of that growth is already baked in, so if you want to really outperform, it's going to have to come from one of three categories.
"
367,CBRE,"The best-performing MLP in the next 12 months will probably be one that has underperformed in the last 12 months. Boardwalk Pipeline Energy (BWP) partners, for example, cut its distribution (in February), and it's already up 50% plus since its bottom off that cut (with its yield at 2.2%).
"
368,CBRE,"The second bucket will be some recent IPO. High-growth MLP IPOs have done phenomenally well: names like Valero Energy Partners (VLP) and Phillips 66 Partners (PSXP). And the market will probably also continue to get excited about name-brand MLPs with big drop-down potential.Special Report: Income InvestingThe fast-moving boom in unconventional gas and oil production has altered the pipelines sector, once a slow-changing, utility-grade investment.

MLPs are less and less reliant on acquiring other companies — on these crapshoot M&A auction processes. They are more and more reliant on clear and visible production growth, and you have several years of cap ex plans to look at.So you can see more clearly now than you could in the past that distributions are going to be sustainable at a higher rate for longer. What that means is that is starting to get priced in. People are more and more comfortable with MLPs, as a sector, growing 6% to 8% a year.So their multiples are going up. That means it's getting harder and harder to find value in the sector, but fundamentally things are moving in the right direction.IBD: What is your outlook here? How should investors moving into MLPs in the coming year look at the space?Howard: In general, the MLPs that will do fine are the ones that are already at premiums. Those will continue to grow. But some of that growth is already baked in, so if you want to really outperform, it's going to have to come from one of three categories.The best-performing MLP in the next 12 months will probably be one that has underperformed in the last 12 months. Boardwalk Pipeline Energy (BWP) partners, for example, cut its distribution (in February), and it's already up 50% plus since its bottom off that cut (with its yield at 2.2%).The second bucket will be some recent IPO. High-growth MLP IPOs have done phenomenally well: names like Valero Energy Partners (VLP) and Phillips 66 Partners (PSXP). And the market will probably also continue to get excited about name-brand MLPs with big drop-down potential.

369,CBRE,"The $1.8 billion Putnam Investors Fund is an old geezer. Its Dec. 1, 1925, inception date makes it the industry's second oldest stock fund.
"
370,CBRE,"But it's acting like a spry spring chicken lately.
"
371,CBRE,"Since Jerry Sullivan took over in mid-2008, the fund's average annual gain is 10.84% through Sept. 30. It tops the S&P 500's 10.02%. And it beats 91% of large-cap blend funds tracked by Morningstar.
"
372,CBRE,"In the same-length period prior to Sullivan's taking charge, the fund's 5.32% average annual gain lagged the S&P 500 and 88% of its large-cap blend peers.
"
373,CBRE,"Sullivan credits his outperformance to an appetite for both growth and value stocks. Also, he targets three types of stocks: ones he's followed for years, those pushed up and down by smart money, and special situations. And he focuses on valuation.
"
374,CBRE,"In addition, he applies lessons learned from his mentor and former boss, former Fidelity Investments superstar Peter Lynch, who ran the now-$16.7 billion Magellan Fund when it sat atop the fund world with strong performance and rapid growth.
"
375,CBRE,"Putnam Investors Fund assets peaked at $16.2 billion in August 2000 and shrank to a low of $1.2 billion by September 2011. Assets have been rising since then.
"
376,CBRE,"Sullivan, who is 54 years old, spoke with IBD from his office in Boston's financial district about how he invests.
"
377,CBRE,"IBD: Is it OK if I mention that you have a distinct Brooklyn accent?
"
378,CBRE,"Sullivan: I was born in Brooklyn and grew up in Long Island. My dad grew up a Brooklyn Dodgers fan. I grew up a New York Mets fan because the Dodgers had just moved to L.A. We hate the Yankees. I would relish your mentioning my accent.
"
379,CBRE,"IBD: You have a flexible style, right? You invest in both growth and value stocks.
"
380,CBRE,"Sullivan: I'm the core manager here at Putnam. Investors Fund is a mix of value and growth. So is my Multi-Cap Core Fund (with $109 million in assets), which is four years old. It's the same style, but even more flexible, because it can go up and down the market-cap spectrum. Investors Fund must have at least 75% of its securities in large caps. Multi-Cap cannot have more than 75% in any one category — large, mid or small cap. Stylewise, they're the same.
"
381,CBRE,"IBD: And what are the three types of stocks that Investors Fund buys?
"
382,CBRE,"Sullivan: I call the first bucket my legacy stocks. They're large caps that I researched earlier in my career or even recently. It was in-depth research. Then I gave each one three minutes of research every week for five, 10, 30 years. I refined my understanding of what factors move each stock up or down. That helps me understand when to make a move. It's my most boring bucket but the most important to me.
"
383,CBRE,"The second bucket has to do with smart money. The main factor is insider buying. I follow that closely and have for many years.
"
384,CBRE,"In the early to mid-1980s, when I worked for Peter Lynch, it was the No. 1 factor that he deferred to when looking for the right timing to buy a stock.
"
385,CBRE,"IBD: What was your role at Fidelity?
"
386,CBRE,"Sullivan: In 1985, I was doing research on European chemical stocks like BASF, Imperial Chemical and (Holland's) Akzo Nobel. Big stocks. It was important for Magellan to look for big, liquid stocks.
"
387,CBRE,"It was also much harder to follow insider transactions. You had to check SEC filings on paper. And they could be six to eight weeks old. The rules were looser about when insiders had to file.
"
388,CBRE,"Sarbanes-Oxley moved it to a 48-hour rule. And now you can watch the information flow in on the Internet in real time.
"
389,CBRE,"It doesn't tell me what to buy, but it gives me ideas.
"
390,CBRE,"The third bucket is special situations. One of the most common are follow-on stock offerings. They used to be called secondary offerings. It might be filed at 4 o'clock on a typical day. XYZ company is doing a follow-on. And you've got 45 minutes to decide if you want to play it or not. They'd file at 4:15 and close their books at 5 p.m.
"
391,CBRE,"IBD: What's a recent one you did?
"
392,CBRE,"Sullivan: The latest was HD Supply (HDS), which was part of Home Depot (HD). (Former CEO) Bob Nardelli started building a distributor of big equipment. They IPO'd it after he left. I bought on the IPO, and they did a secondary offering. I put in offers below the asking price.
"
393,CBRE,"IBD: How often does that work?
"
394,CBRE,"Sullivan: CDW (CDW) is a technology distributor. They sell to midsize companies that don't have big IT departments. They went public last year. Please specify that I still own it but I sold a lot of it.
"
395,CBRE,"I was maybe the first institutional investor to meet with them. They were never fast-growing. The underwriter was asking 22, maybe 24. I said, ""I want to buy a lot at 18."" The underwriter said, ""Maybe you missed the (detail) that we're selling at 24."" I said, ""No, I didn't miss it. I like it at 18, not 24."" At 18 it was trading at 12 times earnings. At 18 times earnings it's not warranted.
"
396,CBRE,"Anyway, they went on a road show, had difficulty getting an audience because a lot of guys thought it was overpriced. After two weeks, they came back and said 18 would work. I said, ""OK, but now I only want it at 17."" They went public at 17. Since then, they've met their meager expectations. As they did, they grabbed a larger audience (of investors). The stock has slowly migrated to 30-ish. That's a great special situation.
"
397,CBRE,"IBD: You like to buy stocks on price weakness. Give me an example, please.
"
398,CBRE,"Sullivan: Buying on weakness was an old Peter Lynch rule.
"
399,CBRE,"I bought Southwest Airlines (LUV) two, 2-1/2 years ago, when it was (trading around 8 or 9).
"
400,CBRE,"The rest of the airlines were doing well. They charge for everything. But Southwest didn't, so it got depressed. It was selling below the replacement costs of all their airplanes. I figured it had to climb. And they could always start charging (for individual services like baggage). I loaded up as much as I could. It's gone to around 34.
"
401,CBRE,"IBD: You've added to your Apple (AAPL) stake. Why?
"
402,CBRE,"Sullivan: I started buying Apple again in the June quarter. It had pulled back from its highs. I took it to my biggest position.
"
403,CBRE,"A year and a half or two years ago, both Apple and Google (GOOGL) went to 700. Then they separated. Apple pulled back. Google shot up. When everyone fell in love with Google, I used it as a source of funds. Apple had hair on it because it hadn't come out with anything new. Now it's coming through again. But it's not expensive on earnings. It's a quasi-value name with meaningful growth.
"
404,CBRE,"IBD: Celgene (CELG) is trending up again. Did investors decide this biotech was oversold?
"
405,CBRE,"Sullivan: This was one of several large biotechs that I started positioning in more than three years ago. They looked like value names with growth. Now their pipelines are still meaningful. They've got good top- and bottom-line growth. Big pharmaceutical firms don't have that. And on a P-E-to-growth basis, it's still attractive. It's been stronger since the (Q1) sell-off than some biotechs like Biogen (BIIB) and Gilead (GILD). I added to Celgene during the weakness (earlier in) the year.
"
406,CBRE,"IBD: Facebook (FB) has had a nice run-up since mid-2013. Is it still attractive?
"
407,CBRE,"Sullivan: I'm underweight now. (My weighting is) less than 50 basis points. It's had a good move. It's the place where the eyeballs are. They were slow to get their mobile application to work. But they've done that. It's still a growth story. But it's trading at 40 times next year's (estimated) earnings, so at this point I'm neutral. I don't want to (make my position) bigger unless the stock pulls back.
"
408,CBRE,"IBD: What's your thesis for CBRE Group (CBG)?
"
409,CBRE,"Sullivan: They're a play on a commercial real estate rebound. They're not expensive.
"
410,CBRE,"They're big brokers, maybe the biggest. They manage big office buildings. It's been a dead area, but it's coming back. Nonresidential construction is coming back, and occupancy rates are getting better. We've got them earning $1.70 (per share) this year and $1.80 next year. They're not a fancy name. They're a bit of a sleeper.
"
411,CBRE,"IBD: Gilead's earnings per share growth has exploded. Is Sovaldi, its hepatitis C treatment, the entire story?
"
412,CBRE,"Sullivan: The real attraction is more than that. They've got drugs for liver and heart disease. And a good platform for AIDS. But the real nice thing is that this stock is inexpensive on earnings. They're expected to earn $8 a share this year and $9.50 next year.
"
413,CBRE,"That's very attractive: 11-1/2 times next year's earnings on a company growing in the teens. And we're fans of their whole pipeline.
"
414,CBRE,"IBD: Is Spirit Airlines' (SAVE) driver its no-frills approach?
"
415,CBRE,"Sullivan: Yes, their no-frills approach is their key.
"
416,CBRE,"The interesting thing is that they're not targeted as competition by larger airlines, which is important. It avoids a price war.
"
417,CBRE,"The larger airlines see them as an ultralow-cost carrier. When they go into a new market, they actually expand the market. Big competitors see that. They get people to fly who don't normally: college students, people on tight budgets, people who don't mind flying at midnight, people who don't mind being charged for extra bags or maybe overhead compartments.
"
418,CBRE,"When will the airlines go after each other to get market share? They're not doing it now. The old managements (that engaged in price wars) have disappeared. Airline bankruptcies are fresh in (airlines managers') heads.
"
419,CBRE,"IBD: Where is railcar-maker Trinity Industries (TRN) in its economic cycle?
"
420,CBRE,"Sullivan: Its cycle still continues to work. We're only halfway through.
"
421,CBRE,"They make all kinds of railroad cars. One of the most interesting on margin is cars that carry sand for fracking. The typical well takes 75 to 80 rail cars of this stuff.
"
422,CBRE,"Trinity is one of the few players in this business. The stock is not expensive.The $1.8 billion Putnam Investors Fund is an old geezer.

463,CBRE,"With the end of World War II, Trammell Crow saw pent-up demand for new industrial warehouses and set out to address the matter.Having just $500, he convinced financial institutions to front cash for construction of a warehouse in Dallas in 1948, even though he didn't have the building fully leased.Thus was born the speculative real estate deal.What Crow (1914-2009) lacked in finances he made up for in pure drive and a captivating personality that could sell ""the vision."" He ignored skeptics and built an empire underpinned by speculation.""Dad was a child of the Depression from a humble background,"" said Harlan Crow, one of Trammell Crow's six children and the CEO of Crow Family Holdings.Stung by the humiliation of poverty, Trammell vowed early to make it big. It wasn't easy. He was the fifth of eight children and had to learn to fend for himself.He earned money by plucking chickens, cleaning salvaged bricks and unloading boxcars.From this modest beginning, Crow built a real estate company that spanned the globe and transformed the skylines of Atlanta, Dallas, San Francisco and multitudes of other cities. Forbes magazine named him America's largest private landlord in 1971.MultimillionaireBy 1975, he was worth $70 million, or $300 million in today's money, according to the Texas State Historical Association.He also developed a passion for fine art. The Trammell & Margaret Crow Collection of Asian Art, which he started with his wife of 66 years, resides in Dallas.That single speculative Dallas warehouse project in 1948 developed into the 2006 Trammel Crow merger with CBRE Group (CBG), a Los Angeles-based real estate developer with offices worldwide, in a transaction valued at $2.2 billion.Along the way, Crow:• Accumulated interests in 300 million square feet of developed real estate encompassing 8,000 properties in more than 100 cities.• Diversified from warehouses into office buildings, merchandise marts, hotels, banks, hospitals and residential developments.• Altered building shapes and functions. While he didn't develop the atrium, he was one of the first to use it extensively in office buildings, hotels and other structures. He pioneered providing warehouse landscaping and ranked among the first to build warehouses fronting the street.• Offered tenants lower rents, shorter lease periods and more amenities than provided by rivals. He often built in features such as artwork and landscaping at no extra charge to show that he appreciated his tenants' business.• Fostered relations with tenants via monthly personal visits to learn of their concerns. If problems arose, he took care of them fast.• Devised an innovative way to reward his employees. Instead of paying high salaries, which he couldn't afford, he made his key staffers partners and paid them on an incentive basis. The harder they worked, the more money Crow made and the more they made. Win-win.• Elevated Dallas as the nation's largest merchandise-mart location, dethroning Chicago.• Achieved listing on the New York Stock Exchange in 1997.• Robert Sulentic, CEO of CBRE, who tutored under Crow and rose to chief executive of the company in 2000, told IBD: ""Trammell Crow is a topic I'm proud to talk about. He made the people who worked with him feel unbelievable. He was a supermotivator. I took a job with Crow at $18,000 a year right out of graduate school when my colleagues were taking jobs at $60,000 per year.""In Robert Sobel's book ""Trammell Crow, Master Builder,"" Ross Perot said: ""Crow made more of his partners millionaires than perhaps any other businessman in history. His ability to dream creatively and make those dreams materialize marked Crow as one of the outstanding businessmen of the century.""Said Harlan Crow: ""People were the reason Dad was successful. He treated them with dignity and provided for their financial interests with the partnership structure.""As pointed out in William Bragg Ewald's ""Trammell Crow: A Legacy of Real Estate Business Innovation,"" Crow built on the foundation of his schooling and career. After graduation from high school in 1932, he worked as a runner for a bank in his native Dallas at $13.50 a week, or $230 in today's money.This foray into the banking industry helped him earn his way through courses at the American Institute of Banking.Texas RiseThree years as a bank teller earned tuition for accounting classes at Dallas College, a division of Southern Methodist University. By 1938, he had passed the Texas Certified Public Accountant exam.Work at the national accounting company Ernst & Young and, in 1940, with Dallas' Smith, Morrison and Salois provided Crow a firm grasp of tax accounting and of how top businesses operated.During the war buildup of 1941, he received an officer's commission from the Navy, then traveled the country and audited the books of defense contractors. All the while, he made solid contacts in the construction industry.After the war came his tough warehouse call.""His vision and willingness to take risks played a major role in Crow's amazing success in real estate,"" said Ewald.Crow invested $200 of his $500 for the construction on the 11,250 square-foot structure. He chose the perfect vehicle for entering real estate. Warehouses churned out steady earnings and cash flow, caused few problems, held their value and were easily maintained.Stepping UpOver the next three decades, Crow dominated Dallas warehouse development and turned to bigger and more diversified development projects. He also expanded nationally, building factories, office buildings, industrial parks and parking garages.Ewald laid out Crow's 10-step success formula:• 1. Borrow the money.• 2. Purchase the land.• 3. Build on speculation while looking for tenants.• 4. Lease the space, not for 15 years but shorter periods of two, three or 10 years.• 5. Depreciate fast enough to wipe out your income-tax liability, using tax-law experience.• 6. With the benefit of inflation, lease again at a higher rate.• 7. Pay debt out of income. Keep debt service greater than depreciation.• 8. After 15 years, own the property free and clear.• 9. Refinance the first mortgage.• 10. Use mortgage proceeds for new deals.The system worked beautifully. Crow's signature projects include:• Dallas' Anatole Hotel, Pioneer Plaza, Medical City, Trammell Crow Center office tower and the Dallas Market Hall, one of the largest privately owned exhibition halls in America;• San Francisco's Embarcadero Center;• Atlanta's Peachtree Center;•I n Europe, Brussels' International Trade Mart.His feats drew applause. He was:• The recipient of more than 20 honorary degrees from colleges and universities.• Named to the U.S. Business Hall of Fame by Fortune in 1987.• Named a member of the Horatio Alger Association of Distinguished Americans in 1988.• Awarded the Order of Leopold by Belgium's government in 1988.""Though he built plenty of iconic Crow buildings across the world, I believe his greatest legacy rests in the people who worked for him, going all the way back to the 1950s,"" said Sulentic. ""They have spread out and become real estate entrepreneurs themselves. Millions of people have fond memories of him. Nobody disliked him.""Crow died at his family's farm in East Texas at age 94.

505,CBRE,"With the market improving, some breakouts that had stalled are now acting better.Air Lease (AL), Sanchez Energy (SN)and CBRE Group (CBG) are examples of breakouts that occurred before last Tuesday's follow-through in the market. Since that rally confirmation, these stocks are functioning more soundly.Air Lease, for example, climbed nearly 7% last week, shaking off cobwebs that had slowed the stock since its breakout May 9, the day after the aircraft leasing firm beat profit expectations.The stock quickly pulled back to its 38.25 entry, but while it stalled it also formed a three-weeks-tight pattern. Air Lease — which is growing quickly as airlines replace older jets with new planes that have better fuel efficiency — cleared the 40.46 buy point of that secondary entry last week.Sanchez Energy, the Texas-based oil and gas exploration company, broke out powerfully May 22. It quickly receded toward the 31.69 buy point. But starting with last Tuesday's market follow-through, the stock roared to new highs. It gushed 10% last week and is now extended from its buy point.Other members of the IBD 50 are awakening as the market firms up. Many remain in buy ranges.But some others that broke out recently still are dragging, including a couple of apparel leaders.Foot Locker (FL) cleared a flat base May 12 and is trading below the 48.81 buy point. Volume was light on the breakout, which could explain why shares have stalled, but there was good upside volume when the company rallied on its earnings report May 23.Iconix Brand Group (ICON), which fell off the list, broke out in heavy trading April 30 and also is below the 42.57 buy point. The parent company of Danskin, London Fog, Mossimo, Joe Boxer and other apparel brands has held above its 50-day moving average despite the flagging action after its move to new highs.For the IBD 50 as a whole, it was a modestly successful week. The index rose 0.5%, which lagged the 1.4% increase for the Nasdaq and the 1.2% gain in the S&P 500.Sanchez Energy and Air Lease were responsible in large part for the IBD 50's weekly advance. Arris Group (ARRS), the maker of TV set-top boxes, was another big contributor, rising 7% last week to new highs.The IBD 50 has now climbed three weeks in a row and has risen back above the 50-day moving average.

Los Angeles and New York were among areas with the smallest increases in that age group.Colorado is home to some of the nation's most popular skiing destinations, with Vail and six other resorts a two-hour drive or less from Denver's center. The city's restaurant scene is also a draw.The city attracts young firms seeking an educated workforce, according to Ferris. DaVita HealthCare Partners (DVA), the country's second-biggest dialysis provider, relocated its base from Los Angeles in 2010, lured by Denver's affordability, diverse talent pool and accessible mass transit, said David Maughan, senior vice president of operations.""We have found it's much easier to recruit to Denver with lower taxes, lower cost of living and so many sunny days,"" he said.The Denver area's unemployment rate was 6% in October, according to the most recent figures from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, which aren't seasonally adjusted. That was below 7.8% in the New York City metropolitan area and the 7% nationwide average.Office rents in Denver averaged $20.08 a square foot in the third quarter, about even with their pre-recession peak, according to brokerage CBRE Group (CBG). By contrast, the national average is 11% less than the 2008 high of $31.19.""The market is able to support such rent growth because office-using employment is expanding beyond its peak level, helping to generate healthy demand for space,"" said Arthur Jones, senior managing economist at CBRE.The third-quarter vacancy rate was 14.6%, below the market average since 1990 and near a pre-recession low of 14.2%, CBRE data show.Government spending on transit upgrades has helped spur the flurry of private investment, according to Ferris, whose office oversees reviews of development proposals.Brookfield Office Properties (BPO), owner of Denver's two tallest office towers, is in the market long-term, said David Sternberg, senior vice president overseeing investment in the Midwest and mountain regions.The New York firm is spending $50 million to renovate the smaller of the buildings, bought for $215 million in December 2011. The property, 1801 California, was more than two-thirds empty at the time. Occupancy, estimated at 60% at the end of 2013, is poised to increase further after the work is done in the first quarter, according to Sternberg.Sales of Denver office properties likely will reach $2.07 billion for 2013, up 18% from 2012 and the most since 2007, according to data from Real Capital Analytics. The research firm estimates apartment-building purchases of $2.16 billion, down from 2012's $2.66 billion — the highest in at least a decade.The city has a long way to go before ranking with a top investment market like Manhattan, where $19 billion of office properties and $8.4 billion of apartment buildings changed hands in 2013 through Dec. 19, Real Capital data show.""Coastal cities like New York, San Francisco or Boston will never lose their appeal, both for workers and for investors,"" said demographer William Frey, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. ""The job market in these cities is immense and it attracts a large amount of people, domestically and from other places. That will never change.""Rising interest in Denver has created more competition and priced out some investors. The city's popularity also is making it harder for some families to buy. Denver and Dallas are the only two U.S. areas where single-family home prices have passed boom-era levels, the Case-Shiller index of 20 cities shows. Denver prices are 4.6% above their 2006 high. The U.S. average is still about 20% below peak.The median Denver house was $285,000 in the third quarter, up 9.7% from a year earlier, according to the Colorado Association of Realtors. But Denver is still far more affordable than New York or California, say the Lodhas, who plan to buy a house in coming months.

577,CBRE,"Prologis, Inc. (PLD  -  Free Report) is slated to report second-quarter 2018 earnings on Jul 17, before the opening bell.In the last reported quarter, this industrial real estate investment trust (REIT) delivered a better-than-expected result in terms of funds from operations (FFO) per share, witnessing a positive surprise of 8.1%. Net effective rent change improved in the quarter, while period-end occupancy remained high.Over the preceding four quarters, Prologis surpassed the FFO per share estimates in three occasions and met in the other. This resulted in an average positive surprise of 4.33%. This is depicted in the graph below:Prologis, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Prologis, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Prologis, Inc. QuoteThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the second-quarter FFO per share is currently pegged at 71 cents.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayThe industrial real estate market is firing on all cylinders, backed by an improving economy and job-market gains, strengthening e-commerce market and high consumption levels. Demand for warehouses, distribution centers and other industrial property remains strong, and continues to surpass supply levels.In fact, per a study by the commercial real estate services firm — CBRE Group Inc. (CBRE  -  Free Report) — availability fell for 32 straight quarters to 7.2% for the U.S. industrial real estate market in the April-June quarter. Notably, this denotes the lowest level since 2000.Given Prologis’s capacity to offer modern distribution facilities at strategic in-fill locations, the company remains well positioned to capitalize on these growth opportunities. It also has solid balance-sheet strength. In the to-be-reported quarter, the company is expected to have enjoyed high occupancy of its properties and healthy rent levels.Moreover, Prologis’ build-to-suit activity has been stellar in the year so far, with the company completing 16 such development projects in the first half. These projects included more than 6.2 million square feet of area and involved total expected investment (TEI) of around $475 million on a Prologis-share basis. Further, this industrial real estate investment trust (REIT) commenced 14 build-to-suit development starts during the same period, comprising more than 4.7 million square feet of space and involving a TEI of approximately $450 million on a Prologis-share basis.This high number of build-to-suit development projects highlights the advantageous location of the company’s land bank, as well as demand from its multi-site customers, many of whom are focused on e-commerce. These sites are positioned in urban markets that are suited for serving as the last warehouse before goods are delivered to consumers.Nevertheless, recovery in the industrial market has continued for long. Also, there is intense competition in the market. Amid these, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the second-quarter rental revenues is currently pegged at $560 million, indicating 0.7% increase sequentially.Further, the stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate of FFO per share for the to-be-reported quarter being revised 1.4% upward to 71 cents over the past three months. However, the figure denotes a projected year-over-year decrease of around 15.5%.Year to date, Prologis has outperformed the industry it belongs to. The company’s shares have appreciated 1.8% in this period compared with its industry’s growth of 0.5%.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:Prologis has the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Prologis is +2.26%.Zacks Rank: Prologis carries a Zacks Rank #3.A positive Earnings ESP is a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely beat in terms of FFO per share.

578,CBRE,"Duke Realty Corporation (DRE  -  Free Report) is making concerted efforts to strengthen its portfolio in strategic markets. Recently, the company added approximately 900,000 square feet of space in its Southern California portfolio by securing a pair of two industrial properties in the Inland Empire East submarket.   The latest projects have enabled the pure play real estate investment trust (REIT) to enhance an industrial portfolio exceeding 10 million square feet of space in Southern California. Notably, the company has expanded its portfolio through disciplined acquisitions and development since it entered the market in 2011, resulting in an impressive asset base of more than 30 well-situated premium bulk distribution properties.  Specifically, Duke Realty is developing a bulk industrial building spanning 241,216 square feet of area at 24960 San Michele in the Moreno Valley and another 656,695-square-foot warehouse at 4323 Indian Avenue in Perris.While both industrial facilities are currently under construction, the property at 24960 San Michele was fully pre-leased by ResMed — a manufacturer of CPAP masks and products related to sleep-disordered breathing.The spec building at 4323 Indian Avenue is scheduled to complete in December 2018. It will offer 650,000 square feet of space, with 36′ clear height, LED lighting, 56′ x 60′ bay spacing, 98 dock doors and 4 drive-thru doors. Further, parking for 154 automobiles and 278 trailers will also be made available.Amid recovering economy and job market gains, elevating consumption levels and healthy manufacturing environment, demand for warehouse and logistics real estate is anticipated to remain robust. This is offering significant impetus to industrial REITs like Prologis Inc. (PLD  -  Free Report), Duke Realty and Liberty Property Trust (LPT  -  Free Report) to flourish.As for Duke Realty, opportunistic acquisition of land sites and ability to identify high-quality properties has enabled the company to gain significant penetration in Southern California which is considered a high-demand industrial market.Per management, there is low vacancy in Inland Empire East and limited new construction. It cited a report by CBRE Group Inc. (CBRE  -  Free Report), per which, the Empire market consists of 511 million square feet of industrial space and has a low vacancy rate of 3.6%.  Hence, the company’s new spec building, providing large and modern industrial space, will enjoy solid leasing activity. Such strategic moves will enable the company to enhance and fortify its portfolio in desired markets.Moreover, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has rallied 10.9% in the past three months, outperforming 7.9% growth recorded by its industry.

579,CBRE,"Sales growth is an important metric for any company, as it is a vital part of growth projections and influences strategic decision-making. By monitoring this key metric over multiple time periods, one can clearly understand a company’s growth trend.Sales growth is essential to justify the fixed and variable expenses incurred to run a business. Low revenues lead to unprofitability of business and disappointing financial results. Stagnant companies may generate near-term profit but can’t rev up enough growth to attract new investors.Also, in a growing economy, lack of sales growth most likely denotes that the company is not gaining market share over its competitors. In simple terms, some sustained sales growth is necessary to support the bottom line.Focusing solely on sales growth is not enough though. A healthy sales growth rate is certainly a positive indicator for picking good stocks, but it does not ensure profits. Hence, taking into consideration a company’s cash position along with its sales number can prove to be a more dependable strategy.Substantial cash on hand and a steady cash flow give a company more flexibility with respect to business decisions and potential investments. Cash also enables a company to endure market downturns. Most importantly, a sufficient cash position indicates that revenues are being channelized in the right direction.Selecting the Winning StocksIn order to shortlist stocks that have witnessed impressive sales growth along with a high cash balance, we have selected 5-Year Historical Sales Growth (%) greater than X-Industry and Cash Flow more than $500 million as our main screening parameters.But sales growth and cash strength are not the absolute criteria for selecting stocks. So, we added certain other factors to arrive at a winning strategy.Price-to-Sales (P/S) Ratio less than X-Industry: This metric determines the value placed on each dollar of a company’s revenues. The lower the ratio, the better it is for picking a stock since the investor is paying less for each unit of sales.% Change F1 Sales Estimate Revisions (four weeks) greater than X-Industry: Better-than-industry estimate revision has often been seen to trigger an increase in stock price.Operating Margin (average last five years) greater than 5%: Operating margin measures how much every dollar of a company's sales translates into profits. A high ratio indicates that the company has good cost control and sales are increasing faster than costs, an optimal situation for it.Return on Equity (ROE) greater than 5%: This metric will ensure that sales growth is translated into profits and the company is not hoarding cash. A high ROE means the company is spending wisely and is in all likelihood profitable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Here are five of the 13 stocks that qualified the screening:Based in Kenosha, WI, Snap-on Incorporated (SNA  -  Free Report) manufactures and markets tools, equipment, diagnostics, and repairs information and systems solutions.

580,CBRE,"CBRE Group Inc. (CBRE  -  Free Report) has announced to acquire a majority interest in Israel-based facilities management provider, Ramot Group. Terms of the deal have not been undisclosed yet. The deal, subject to customary regulatory approvals, is likely to be completed by third-quarter 2018.Notably, Ramot Group has been working with CBRE Group since 2009 and providing services to CBRE Group’s Israel-based corporate clients. Post-acquisition, Ramot Group will offer its specialized technical capabilities and facilities management while working as part of CBRE Group’s Global Workplace Solutions (GWS), an occupier outsourcing business in Israel.Founded in 1993, Ramot Group offers services like technical maintenance, project management, cleaning services, reception administration, and environmental health and safety. Per CBRE Group, the team at Ramot Group is viewed as highly competent and their association will help the company in delivering great results to clients. Hence, the acquisition seems a strategic fit.CBRE Group has been focusing on expanding its presence in Israel. In April 2018, it acquired MAN Properties. Capital markets and leasing services are provided by MAN Properties in office, technology and retail sectors.Notably, CBRE Group has banked on strategic in-fill acquisitions to widen its geographic coverage while expanding and reinforcing service offerings. The company focuses on acquiring regional or specialty firms, which complement its existing platform as well as independent affiliates, in which, at times, it holds small stakes. As market conditions continue to improve, we believe, these opportunistic acquisitions and strategic investments will likely serve as growth drivers.Further, with CBRE Group’s market-leading position and an increasing trend of real estate occupiers turning to outsourcing, the company remains well poised to continue experiencing a flourishing trend in this business line.Shares of this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock have surged 38.9% over the past year, widely outperforming the industry’s growth of 7.1%. Other Stocks Worth a LookA few other top-ranked stocks from the same space are Colliers International Group Inc.

581,CBRE,"Duke Realty Corp. (DRE  -  Free Report) has clinched a lease deal with a furniture delivery and fulfillment service company — Metropolitan Warehouse & Delivery — for ePort 960. This facility is the company’s 220,200-square-foot warehouse property at 960 High Street in Perth Amboy.With this lease deal for the whole building, Duke Realty has achieved full occupancy for its New Jersey in-service portfolio. This highlights the elevated demand for modern warehouse properties closer to the New York metropolitan area, and reflects Duke Realty’s solid capacity to leverage on the favorable trend. Particularly, the ePort 960 property is well suited for last-mile fulfilment operations.ePort 960 was added to Duke Realty’s portfolio last year as part of its 3.1-million-square-foot New Jersey industrial portfolio acquisition, which comprised six buildings, as well as two development sites situated along the I-95 corridor. Further, the 960 High Street property is among the three new industrial buildings, which are together referred as the ePort Logistics Center owned by Duke Realty in Perth Amboy.Notably, of late, demand for modern distribution facilities have been getting a significant boost as companies are compelled to enhance and renovate their distribution and production platforms to support the e-commerce business, address a large customer base and urbanization. Services like same-day delivery are gaining traction and last-mile properties are witnessing a solid increase in asset values.These have helped the industrial REITs to scale new heights. Per a study by the commercial real estate services firm, CBRE Group Inc. (CBRE  -  Free Report), availability fell for 31 straight quarters to 7.3%, for the U.S. industrial market, in first-quarter 2018. Moreover, with demand surpassing new supply, net asking rents inched up 1.9% in Q1 to $7.01 per square foot, denoting the highest level since 1989.Moreover, according to a report from Prologis Inc. (PLD  -  Free Report), for a given level of revenues, online retailers require three times the distribution-center space compared with traditional retailers. This, in turn, is spurring demand for industrial space.Particularly, with a recovering economy and job market gains, as well as tax reforms, consumption levels are anticipated to remain elevated. And with a healthy manufacturing environment and high business inventories, demand for warehouse and logistics real estate is anticipated to be high, giving significant impetus to industrial REITs like Prologis, Duke Realty and Liberty Property Trust (LPT  -  Free Report) to flourish.Specifically, it should be noted that Duke Realty has resorted to sale of sub-urban office assets and medical-office buildings in the past, in a bid to transform itself into a domestic-focused industrial property REIT. This augurs well amid the favorable market environment in this asset class. The company already has 5.7 million square feet of industrial properties in its New Jersey portfolio besides having properties in other key markets. However, the dilutive impact of asset dispositions on earnings, stiff competition and rate hike remain concerns for the company.In addition, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has rallied 9.1% in the past three months, outperforming 4.2% growth recorded by its industry.

Recently, this industrial real estate investment trust (REIT) announced that it completed the leasing of the third building at 33 Logistics Park in Lehigh Valley, PA.Notably, the property’s strategic location worked on the company’s advantage and thus, Duke Realty could achieve 100% occupancy for this development, spanning 2.7 million square feet. The property is on the east of Lehigh Valley, with access to the highway. Also, it could be connected to I-78, I-81 and I-80 very easily.33 Logistics Park has three buildings.

The company’s market-leading position will help it to capitalize on commercial real estate tailwinds.In June, the company announced the acquisition of procurement and facilities management solutions provider — FacilitySource, LLC — from Warburg Pincus. The company has shelled out approximately $290 million in cash for the buyout, which is expected to considerably boost the delivery of integrated solutions to occupier clients.

As large corporations continue to look to limit the number of service providers, CBRE Group is expected to continue to gain from the trend. Moreover, strategic reinvestment in its business, specifically on the technology front, is expected to set CBRE Group apart from its peers.The company has seen 17.5% EPS growth in the last three to five years compared with the industry’s 1.7%. Moreover, the projected 2018 EPS growth rate is around 15%.Recurring Revenue Model: CBRE Group has opted for a better-balanced and more resilient business model by shifting the revenue mix toward more contractual sources and leasing. Contractual revenues and leasing, largely recurring over time, constituted 74% of total fee revenues in 2017 compared with 61% in 2006. This makes the company resilient to market disruptions and positions it well to achieve both top and bottom-line growth even despite capital market headwinds.In fact, CBRE Group’s projected sales growth of 40.7% for 2018 compares favorably with the breakeven estimated for the industry.Flourishing Occupier Outsourcing Business: Occupiers of real estate are increasingly opting for outsourcing and in doing so, they depend on the expertise of third-party real estate specialists to achieve improvement in execution and efficiency. With a market-leading position and being one of the few companies with occupier outsourcing capabilities on a global scale, CBRE Group is well poised to capitalize on the favorable trend.In fact, growth was broad-based with 33 new, 36 expansions and 27 renewal contracts in first-quarter 2018. International contract activity was solid in the quarter with the outsourcing pipeline at an all-time high. Further, the company continues to achieve diversification in terms of client-industry mix.Cash Flow Growth: CBRE Group saw historical cash flow growth (three to five years) of 17.5%, which comfortably exceeded 10.3% growth registered by the industry. Also, its current cash flow growth of 16.0% compares favorably with the 9.3% increase estimated for the industry.Superior ROE: CBRE Group’s return on equity is 24.2%, compared with the industry’s average of around 5%. This shows that the company reinvests more efficiently compared to the industry.Other Stocks to ConsiderInvestors can also consider other top-ranked stocks from the same space like Henderson Land Development Company Limited (HLDCY  -  Free Report), Jones Lang LaSalle Incorporated (JLL  -  Free Report) and Vonovia SE (VONOY  -  Free Report).

585,CBRE,"Monmouth Real Estate Investment Corporation (MNR  -  Free Report) has shelled out nearly $33.7 million for the purchase of a new 362,942-square-foot industrial building at 6735 Trippel Road, Theodore, AL. Net-leased for 11 years to Amazon Fulfillment Service, this buyout marks the company’s second property leased to Amazon.The purchase of this industrial property, which is situated on around 31.27 acres, in the Mobile, AL MSA, is a strategic fit. This is because it will help Monmouth Real Estate capitalize on the growing demand for the Port of Mobile due to the completion of the Panama Canal expansion.Per the company, over the past years, shipping container growth at the U.S. East Coast ports is surpassing that of the West Coast ports. Moreover, with two interstate highway systems and five Class-1 railroads serving the port, industrial real estate assets in the region are likely to experience solid demand for space.Of late, demand for modern distribution facilities have been getting a significant boost as companies are compelled to enhance, and renovate their distribution and production platforms to support the e-commerce business, address a large customer base and urbanization.As such, industrial REITs are scaling new heights. Per a study by the commercial real estate services firm, CBRE Group Inc. (CBRE  -  Free Report), availability fell for 31 straight quarters to 7.3%, for the U.S. industrial market, in first-quarter 2018. Moreover, with demand surpassing new supply, net asking rents inched up 1.9% in Q1 to $7.01 per square foot, denoting the highest level since 1989.In addition, per a report from Prologis Inc. (PLD  -  Free Report), for a given level of revenues, online retailers require three times the distribution-center space compared with traditional retailers. This, in turn, is spurring demand for industrial space.Particularly, with a recovering economy and job market gains, as well as tax reforms, consumption levels are anticipated to remain elevated. And with a healthy manufacturing environment and high business inventories, demand for warehouse and logistics real estate is anticipated to be high, giving significant impetus to industrial REITs like Prologis Inc., Duke Realty Corp. (DRE  -  Free Report) and others to flourish.Particularly, Monmouth Real Estate, with a portfolio of 109 properties spanning around 20.5 million rentable square feet of area, across 30 states, remains well poised to leverage on the favorable trend. Its focus on single tenant, net-leased industrial properties that are leased for long term to mainly investment-grade tenants augurs well for growth.Additionally, shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have outperformed the industry over the past three months.

586,CBRE,"Duke Realty Corp. (DRE  -  Free Report) has started developing Fairfield Logistics Center 7940 — a 284,865-square-foot bulk warehouse in Fairfield. The move comes as part of the company’s concerted efforts to capitalize on healthy fundamentals of the industrial real estate market.The new building, situated on the Seward Road close to its intersection with Tylersville Road and in proximity to a number of Duke Realty industrial properties in the Cincinnati metro area, will likely be delivered in the fourth quarter of this year. It will be accessible through multiple routes and is within five miles of both I-75 and I-275.Having considerable access to highways, the construction of this building on a speculative basis, which will provide modern warehouse space for users with immediate needs, is a strategic fit for the company. This is because the Cincinnati metro area enjoys a central location which offers distributors the scope to reach a bulk of the U.S. population in a one-day drive. Duke Realty already has a robust presence in the region, with several of its properties, including Union Centre Industrial Park in West Chester, and its existing portfolio has at or near 100% occupancy.In fact, with Fairfield Logistics Center 7940 being located in the TriCounty submarket and enjoying highway accessibility, it is likely to be a preferred choice for companies seeking last-mile delivery facilities.Of late, demand for modern distribution facilities have been getting a significant boost as companies are compelled to enhance, and renovate their distribution and production platforms to support the e-commerce business, address a large customer base and urbanization. Services like same-day delivery are gaining traction and last-mile properties are witnessing a solid increase in asset values.These have helped the industrial REITs scale new heights.

This augurs well amid the favorable market environment in this asset class. However, the dilutive impact of asset dispositions on earnings, stiff competition and rate hike remain concerns for the company.Moreover, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has rallied 10.3% in the past three months, outperforming 6.2% growth recorded by its industry.

588,CBRE,"When a rate hike is announced by the Federal Reserve, investors in the REIT space are usually skittish because of the sector’s dependence on debt and the investment world treating them as bond substitutes for their high and consistent dividend-paying nature. There was no exception this time too and the REIT industry went into red, when the much anticipated rate hike occurred this time.However, instead of fretting over the rate that was increased by a quarter percentage point in the recently concluded FOMC meeting and brooding too much on the indication of two more hikes later this year, we ought to shift attention to the better outlook offered by the Fed in terms of GDP growth for 2018. More good news is a positive revision in projected inflation and a slash in the Fed’s forecast for unemployment.Such an environment can be far more rewarding for the REITs business, which usually buoys up on a stepped-up economy and job scenario. And why not? With one eventually requiring “real space” for economic activities, prospects of the real estate sector get a boost as growth in the economy and job market translates into greater demand for real estate and higher occupancy levels.Particularly, with a recovering economy and job market gains as well as tax reforms, consumption levels are anticipated to remain elevated. And with a healthy manufacturing environment and high business inventories, demand for warehouse and logistics real estate is anticipated to be high, giving significant impetus to industrial REITs to flourish.In fact, in recent years, companies are being compelled to enhance and renovate their distribution and production platforms to support the e-commerce business, address a large customer base and urbanization.

Moreover, with demand surpassing new supply, net asking rents climbed 1.9% in Q1 to $7.01 per square foot, denoting the highest level since 1989.Lodging/Resorts REITs too are in the favorable bunch as an improving economy, growth in employment and rise in wages are likely to drive demand for hotels. Particularly, improved business travel demand with lower cancellations and higher group spends, plus strong demand from the leisure division signal brighter prospects for these REITs.4 Stocks to Scoop Big GainsHere we have handpicked four REIT stocks from the above-mentioned asset categories that sport a top Zacks Rank.

590,CBRE,"You can simply arrive at a decision to Buy or Sell a particular stock by looking at its sales and earnings numbers. But such a strategy does not always guarantee superior returns. A critical analysis of the company’s financial background is always required for a better investment decision.A company’s fundamentals should be sound enough to meet its financial obligations. This can be judged with coverage ratios — the higher these are the more efficient an enterprise will be in meeting its financial obligations. Here we have discussed one such ratio — the Interest Coverage Ratio.Interest Coverage Ratio = Earnings before Interest & Taxes (EBIT) divided by Interest Expense.Why Interest Coverage Ratio?Interest Coverage Ratio is used to determine how effectively a company can pay the interest charged on its debt.Debt, which is crucial for most of the companies to finance operations, comes at a cost called interest. Interest expense has a direct bearing on the profitability of a company and the company’s creditworthiness depends on how effectively it meets its interest obligations. Therefore, Interest Coverage Ratio is one of the important criteria to factor in before making any investment decision.Interest Coverage Ratio suggests the number of times the interest could be paid from earnings and also gauges the margin of safety a firm carries for paying interest.An interest coverage ratio lower than 1.0 implies that the company is unable to fulfill its interest obligations and could default on repaying debt. A company that is capable of generating earnings well above its interest expense can withstand financial hardship. Definitely, one should also track the company’s past performance to determine whether the interest coverage ratio has improved or worsened over a period of time.What’s the Strategy?Apart from having an Interest Coverage Ratio that is more than the industry average, adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a VGM Score of A or B to your search criteria should lead to better results.Interest Coverage Ratio greater than X-Industry MedianPrice greater than or equal to 5: The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.5-Year Historical EPS Growth (%) greater than X-Industry Median: Stocks that have a strong EPS growth history.Projected EPS Growth (%) greater than X-Industry Median: This is the projected EPS growth over the next three to five years. This shows that the stock has near-term earnings growth potential.Average 20-Day Volume greater than 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.VGM Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential.  Here are five of the 24 stocks that qualified the screening:Steel Dynamics, Inc. (STLD  -  Free Report), which is engaged in the steel products manufacturing and metals recycling businesses, has a VGM Score of B and an expected EPS growth rate of 12% for 3-5 years.

593,CBRE,"The Q1 earnings season, which is well past the halfway mark, is widely anticipated to be one of the strongest in the past seven years with decent performance across the table. As global tensions eased a bit with leaders of North and South Korea pledging to collaborate to secure complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and reduce the risk of war, the markets might be headed for a smooth spell.As investors employ a wait-and-see approach in a classic example of “backing and filling” in the market, they could benefit from ‘cash cow’ stocks that garner higher returns.However, singling out cash-rich stocks alone does not make for a solid investment proposition unless they are backed by attractive efficiency ratios like return on equity (ROE). A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting its cash at a high rate of return.Why ROE?ROE = Net Income/Shareholders’ EquityROE helps investors distinguish profit-generating companies from profit burners and is useful in determining the financial health of a company. In other words, this financial metric enables investors to identify stocks that diligently deploy cash for higher returns.Moreover, ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry — the higher, the better. It measures how well a company is multiplying its profits without investing new equity capital and portrays management’s efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk-adjusted returns.Screening ParametersIn order to shortlist stocks that are cash rich with high ROE, we have added Cash Flow greater than $1 billion and ROE greater than X-Industry as our primary screening parameters. In addition, we have taken a few other criteria into consideration to arrive at a winning strategy.Price/Cash Flow less than X-Industry: This metric measures how much investors pay for one dollar of free cash flow. A lower ratio indicates that investors need to pay less for a better cash flow generating stock.Return on Assets (ROA) greater than X-Industry: This metric determines how much profit a company earns for every dollar of asset, which includes cash, accounts receivable, property, equipment, inventory and furniture. The higher the ROA, the better it is for the company.5-Year EPS Historical Growth greater than X-Industry: This criterion indicates that continued earnings momentum has translated into solid cash strength.   Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Here are five of the 18 stocks that qualified the screen:CBRE Group, Inc. (CBRE  -  Free Report): Headquartered in Los Angeles, CBRE Group is a commercial real estate services and investment firm.

594,CBRE,"Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and CBRE Group, Inc. (CBRE  -  Free Report) may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because CBRE Group is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for CBRE in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at 51 cents per share for CBRE, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of 49 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for CBRE, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +3.59% heading into earnings season.CBRE Group, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise CBRE Group, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | CBRE Group, Inc. QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market.

You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) Rank stocks here.Clearly, recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for CBRE Group, and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

595,CBRE,"Duke Realty Corp. (DRE  -  Free Report) is making concerted efforts to capitalize on healthy fundamentals of the industrial real estate market. Recently, the company announced that it started developing an 183,296-square-foot bulk warehouse at Glendale Heights in the Central DuPage submarket. The new building, situated at 990 North Avenue (Route 64) and close to I-355, is expected to be delivered in November 2018.Having decent freeway access, the construction of this building on a speculative basis seems a strategic fit for the company. This is because the Central DuPage submarket enjoys proximity to downtown Chicago and has densely inhabited neighborhoods in its surroundings.Moreover, the area is a preferred choice for companies, seeking last-mile distribution locations. Also, with limited availability, the submarket enjoys solid leasing activity. Duke Realty already has a presence in the submarket, with five other buildings, aggregating more than 1.3 million square feet. All the buildings are fully leased.Notably, industrial real estate investment trusts (REITs) are indeed firing on all cylinders and per a study by the commercial real estate services firm, CBRE Group Inc. (CBRE  -  Free Report), availability declined for 31 straight quarters to 7.3% for the U.S. industrial market in first-quarter 2018. Moreover, with demand surpassing supply, net asking rents climbed 1.9% in Q1 to $7.01 per square feet, denoting the highest level since 1989.In order to support e-commerce business, address a large customer base and urbanization, companies are being compelled to enhance and renovate their distribution and production platforms. Services like same-day delivery are gaining traction, propelling demand for modern distribution facilities. Also, last-mile properties are witnessing a solid increase in asset values.In fact, despite supply picking up the pace, demand remains robust, creating scope for rental rates to grow in several markets. This is offering significant impetus to industrial REITs like Prologis Inc. (PLD  -  Free Report), Duke Realty and Liberty Property Trust (LPT  -  Free Report) to flourish.With recovering economy and job market gains as well as tax reforms, consumption levels are anticipated to remain elevated in the future. Moreover, with healthy manufacturing environment and high business inventories, demand for warehouse and logistics real estate is anticipated to be high.    Specifically, speaking about Duke Realty, we note that the company has resorted to the sale of suburban office assets and medical-office buildings in the past, in a bid to transform itself into a domestic-focused industrial property REIT. This augurs well amid the favorable market environment in this asset class. However, the dilutive impact of asset dispositions on earnings, stiff competition and rate hike remain concerns for the company.Moreover, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has rallied 11.9% in the past three months, outperforming 4.7% growth recorded by its industry.

596,CBRE,"CBRE Group Inc. (CBRE  -  Free Report) has announced the acquisition of the procurement and facilities management solutions provider — FacilitySource, LLC — from Warburg Pincus. The company has shelled out approximately $290 million in cash for this acquisition, which is expected to considerably boost the delivery of integrated solutions to occupier clients.Founded in 2005, FacilitySource has carved a niche for itself over the years with its proprietary SaaS technology platform. The company’s services are based on advanced analytics competencies that use performance data, collected over a long period across $3 billion of annualized spending.In fact, with operation centers in Columbus, OH, and a back-office support center in Phoenix, AZ; FacilitySource supports more than 120,000 client sites throughout the nation for facilities management services, capital-improvement and energy-management projects. The company particularly focuses on large multi-site portfolios.Hence, the acquisition of FacilitySource seems a strategic fit for CBRE. Per the company, the buyout will aid in building “a tech-enabled supply chain capability that is unique in the occupier outsourcing industry” while around 550 professionals and more than 25,000 qualified service providers will join CBRE Group’s platform.Notably, CBRE Group has banked on strategic in-fill acquisitions to widen its geographic coverage while expanding and reinforcing service offerings. The company focuses on acquiring regional or specialty firms, which complement its existing platform as well as independent affiliates in which, at times, it holds small stakes.Furthermore, the company opts for larger, transformational deals, driven by macro policies. As market conditions continue to improve, we believe, these opportunistic acquisitions and strategic investments will likely serve as growth drivers, driving its organic growth.Further, with an increasing trend of real estate occupiers turning to outsourcing and its market-leading position, CBRE Group remains well poised to continue experiencing a flourishing trend in this business line.Currently, CBRE Group has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The company’s shares have increased 14.4% in the past six months against its industry’s decline of 0.1%.Stocks to ConsiderA few better-ranked stocks from the same space are Colliers International Group Inc. (CIGI  -  Free Report), Jones Lang LaSalle Inc. (JLL  -  Free Report) and Vonovia SE Unsponsored ADR (VONOY  -  Free Report). All the stocks carry a Zacks Rank of 2 (Buy).

598,CBRE,"Industrial REITs have been firing on all cylinders and per a study by the commercial real estate services firm — CBRE Group Inc. (CBRE  -  Free Report) — availability fell for 31 straight quarters to 7.3% for the U.S. industrial market in Q1. Moreover, with demand surpassing new supply, net asking rents climbed 1.9% in the quarter to $7.01 per square foot, marking the highest level since 1989.In fact, companies are now compelled to enhance and renovate their distribution and production platforms, in order to support e-commerce business, address a large customer base and urbanization. Services like same-day delivery are gaining traction, propelling demand for modern distribution facilities. Also, last-mile properties are witnessing a solid increase in asset values.However, not all industrial REITs are equally poised to excel. Rather, only the ones with solid capacity and healthy fundamentals remain well poised to capitalize on this trend.One such stock is Prologis Inc. (PLD  -  Free Report). This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock has risen 15.4% in a year’s time, against its industry’s decline of 3.6%. There is further scope for solid price appreciation given the REIT’s sound fundamentals and improving prospects.In fact, in April 2018, Prologis announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement with DCT Industrial Trust Inc. (DCT  -  Free Report) to acquire the latter in an $8.4-billion stock-for-stock deal, including debt assumption. Notably, the deal, which is anticipated to create near-term synergies of nearly $80 million, was unanimously approved by both companies’ board of directors. DCT shareholders will be given 1.02 shares of Prologis in exchange of each DCT share. The transaction, subject to other customary closing conditions, is expected to close in third-quarter 2018.Moreover, backed by solid operating results, Prologis put up a stellar show in first-quarter 2018. Net effective rent change improved in the quarter, while period-end occupancy remained high. This industrial REIT also raised its guidance for 2018 core funds from operations (FFO) per share.What Makes Prologis a Solid Choice?Revenue Strength: Prologis’ top line has been displaying strength for the past several quarters. In fact, since first-quarter 2015 through first-quarter 2018, the company reported better-than-expected revenue figures in each quarter. Given the strength in its fundamentals, this upbeat trend is likely to continue ahead.Cash Flow Growth: Prologis enjoyed a historical cash flow growth (3-5 years) of 22.3%, which comfortably exceeded the industry’s growth of 17.3%. Also, the company’s current cash flow growth of 19.1% is way ahead of the industry’s rate of 6.2%. Finally, the company exited first-quarter 2018 with more than $3.6 billion of liquidity.FFO per Share Growth: Prologis witnessed 14.9% growth in FFO per share, over the last three-five years, against 6.3% of that of the industry. In addition, its FFO per share is estimated to grow at the rate of 7.1% for the current year, ahead of 3.1% of that of the industry.Strong Leverage: The debt-to-equity ratio for Prologis is 0.51 compared with the industry average of 0.84. This highlights greater financial stability of the company and lesser risk for shareholders.Superior ROE: Prologis’ Return on Equity (ROE) is 9.86% compared with the industry’s average of 4.9%. This indicates that the company reinvests more efficiently compared to the industry.Estimate Revisions: The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year FFO per share being revised 0.7% upward to $2.98 in a month’s time. Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the next year has been revised north, over the past three months. This reflects analysts’ bullish sentiments on the stock.Going forward, with a recovering economy and job market gains, as well as tax reforms, consumption levels are anticipated to remain elevated. And with a healthy manufacturing environment and high business inventories, demand for warehouse and logistics real estate will likely be high. Given Prologis’ solid capacity, it remains well poised to capitalize on this trend.Other Stocks to ConsiderOther similarly-ranked stocks in the REIT space include Chatham Lodging Trust (CLDT  -  Free Report) and Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.

599,CBRE,"So what if the U.S. REIT industry did not have a smooth start this year with returns turning negative in the first two months? The sector not only rebounded in March, but was also in the positive territory in April despite the rate hike and high treasury yields. And now, it has emerged from the latest NAREIT media release that the operating performance of this special hybrid asset class was decent in Q1.  Specifically, the Q1 scorecard reveals that funds from operations (FFO) totaled $15.3 billion, denoting a 3.6% increase on a sequential basis and growth of 6% year over year. Same-store net operating income (NOI) increased 2.5% year over year. Occupancy rates for all Equity REITs were high at 93.6% and managed growth of 18 basis points on a year-over-year basis, while it saw a slight sequential slip.Among the top-performing Equity REIT property segments, Industrial, Manufactured Homes, Diversified and Office, witnessed robust same-store NOI growth of 5.6%, 4.8%, 4.1% and 3.5%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis.No doubt, industrial REITs are firing on all cylinders and per a study by the commercial real estate services firm — CBRE Group Inc. (CBRE  -  Free Report) — availability fell for 31 straight quarters to 7.3% for the U.S. industrial market in first-quarter 2018. Moreover, with demand surpassing new supply, net asking rents climbed 1.9% in Q1 to $7.01 per square feet, denoting the highest level since 1989.In fact, to support e-commerce business, address a large customer base and urbanization, companies are being compelled to enhance and renovate their distribution and production platforms. Services like same-day delivery are gaining traction, propelling demand for modern distribution facilities. Also, last-mile properties are witnessing a solid increase in asset values.However, retail REITs are not in the pink as mall traffic continues to suffer from the rapid shift in customers' shopping preference through the online channel. In fact, with ecommerce gaining market share from the traditional brick-and-mortar stores, retailers are compelled to reconsider their footprint and eventually opt for store closures in recent years, while others unable to cope with competition have been filing bankruptcies.Particularly, amid a surge in store closures, Regional Mall REITs bore the brunt in Q1 with temporary increase in vacancies and FFO reporting an 18% decline from the prior quarter. This has also affected the overall REIT industry’s performance as excluding Regional Mall REITs, total REIT FFO would have grown 7.1% from the prior quarter, reflecting solid demand for space from other sectors.Nevertheless, Regional Mall REITs are fighting back and improving the productivity of retail assets by grabbing attention from new and productive tenants and disposing the non-productive ones. So space refilling is taking place at higher rents as is indicated by the strong releasing spreads.In case of hotel REITs too, an improving economy, growth in employment and a rise in wages are likely to drive demand for hotels. Particularly, improved business travel demand with lower cancellations and higher group spends, plus strong demand from the leisure division signal better prospects for hotel REITs.Moreover, solid dividend payouts are arguably the biggest enticement for REIT shareholders. Dividend from Equity and Mortgage REITs aggregated $14.3 billion, denoting a 3.8% sequential increase. Total dividends paid were also up 7.4% from the prior-year quarter. Also, REIT valuations look attractive as with earnings growth along with mixed stock market performance have led to the lowest aggregate price-to-FFO ratio (15.8x) since 2011.So the time is now apt to bet on some REIT stocks that have a favorable rank and solid scope for growth in a recovering economy. As a bonus point, these companies have enjoyed positive estimate revisions from analysts, reflecting their bullish sentiments.Here are the four picks:  Bethesda, MD-based Pebblebrook Hotel Trust (PEB  -  Free Report) is a hotel REIT engaged in the acquisition and investment of hotel properties mainly in upper upscale, full-service hotels situated in urban markets in major gateway cities. The stock sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and has a long-term growth rate of 5%. It is a steady performer, having beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 10.04%. Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 has been revised 3.1% upward in a month’s time.San Francisco, CA-based Prologis, Inc. (PLD  -  Free Report) is a leading industrial REIT that acquires, develops, operates and manages industrial real estate space in the United States and globally. The stock has a Zacks Rank of 2 (Buy). Backed by high period-end occupancy and improving net effective rent change, the company posted a positive surprise of 8.1% in terms of funds from operations (FFO) per share.Also, in April, Prologis announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement with DCT Industrial Trust (DCT  -  Free Report) to acquire the latter in an $8.4-billion stock-for-stock deal. The combined portfolio will enable the company to realize significant synergies and strengthen its position in key markets. Reflecting positive sentiments, the stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 FFO per share being revised 2.1% upward in a month’s time.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc. (HST  -  Free Report), headquartered in Bethesda, MD, is one of the leading lodging REITs having a portfolio of luxury and upper-upscale hotels in the United States and abroad. The stock has a Zacks Rank of 2. Host Hotels came up with a positive surprise in terms of FFO per share in the latest reported quarter and results highlighted margin improvement through better productivity.Strategic capital-recycling program and a healthy balance sheet bode well for long-term growth. Further, management expects group business demand to be strong for the rest of the year with solid group booking pace. Moreover, the stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 FFO per share being revised 3% upward in a month’s time.Innovative Industrial Properties, Inc. (IIPR  -  Free Report), headquarter in San Diego, CA, is focused on the acquisition, ownership and management of specialized industrial properties leased to experienced, state-licensed operators for medical-use cannabis facilities. It has a Zacks Rank of 2. The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 being revised 4.5% upward in two months’ time.Note: Anything related to earnings presented in this write-up represent funds from operations (FFO) — a widely used metric to gauge the performance of REITs.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

600,CBRE,"The Federal Reserve didn’t raise interest rates at the latest FOMC meeting. But with inflation nearing its target 2% mark, the market expects the central bank to stay the course and raise rates at least two more times this year and three times next.This seemingly hawkish Fed stance would typically be a negative backdrop for REITs, but the space appears to have done adequate preparation for this monetary policy tightening cycle. Stronger balance sheets, fixed rate borrowings and extended maturities are some of the notable features that are giving REITs the flexibility to operate in the current environment. This financial flexibility is encouraging down the line for their operational efficiencies.Moreover, high consumer confidence in an improving economy and job market gains are fueling consumption levels. In fact, with one eventually requiring “real space” for economic activities, prospects of the real estate sector are getting a boost as growth in the economy translates into greater demand for real estate and higher occupancy levels.Further, valuation-wise, several REIT stocks seem attractive, while encouraging performance by a number of REITs in Q1 as well as an increase in merger and acquisition activities in the industry point at the prevailing favorable environment. Further with the inflation level creeping up, one must keep in mind that REIT dividend growth has surpassed inflation (as measured by Consumer Price Index), in 18 of the past 20 years.All these provide enough incentive to investors to delve into the fundamentals of the individual asset segment of the REIT industry.Industrial REITsIndustrial REITs are indeed firing on all cylinders, and per a study by the commercial real estate services firm CBRE Group Inc. (CBRE  -  Free Report), availability fell for 31 straight quarters to 7.3% for the U.S. industrial market in first-quarter 2018. Moreover, with demand surpassing new supply, net asking rents climbed 1.9% in Q1 to $7.01 per square feet, denoting the highest level since 1989.In fact, to support e-commerce business, address a large customer base and urbanization, companies are being compelled to enhance and renovate their distribution and production platforms. Services like same-day delivery are gaining traction, propelling demand for modern distribution facilities. Also, last-mile properties are witnessing a solid increase in asset values.Going forward, with a recovering economy and job market gains as well as tax reforms, consumption levels are anticipated to remain elevated. And with a healthy manufacturing environment and high business inventories, demand for warehouse and logistics real estate is anticipated to be high.Data Center, Cell Tower REITsIn addition to industrial REITs, e-commerce is also driving demand for data center and cell tower REITs. This is because, when demand is placed through smartphones, tablets or computers, the order is transmitted through cell towers and processed at data centers. In fact, without the offering of this critical infrastructure, the e-commerce value chain simply cannot sustain and therefore REITs, which happen to own many of these cell towers and data centers, are expected to benefit substantially.Along with making purchases online, an increasing number of people are consuming digital content. Estimated growth rate for the markets of artificial intelligence, Internet of Things, autonomous vehicle and virtual/augmented reality are also anticipated to remain robust over the next five to eight years. In addition, the deployment of 5G network should drive growth of tower and fiber business as wireless carriers look to expand and enhance their networks. Therefore, along with an improved outlook for economic growth, all these only make us hugely optimistic about extensive growth in demand for space at cell tower and data-center REITs.Retail REITsDespite several preeminent retail bankruptcy filings and record-high defaults by retail corporates, recent data from Reis, which Reuters had cited, shows that U.S. retail real estate vacancies was 10% in the first quarter of 2018 -- unchanged for the fourth consecutive quarter. Admittedly, consumer confidence is still high. Moreover, the stability clearly reflects the benefit from concerted efforts of the retail landlords to boost productivity of retail assets by trying to grab attention from new and productive tenants and disposing the non-productive ones. Also, with limited retail supply, refurbishment of existing properties is gaining traction.Retail REITs are now avoiding heavy dependence on apparel and accessories, and rather expanding dining options, opening movie theaters, offering recreational facilities and opening fitness centers in particular. Also, amid the changing landscape in the retail real estate market, prime properties continue to enjoy strong demand, though class B and lower properties are experiencing a decline in occupancies. With the recent tax overhaul likely to benefit wages, consumer confidence and consumption levels, demand for prime properties is anticipated to remain strong in the rest of the year.Residential REITsIn the national apartment market, despite high supply and a seasonally slow first-quarter leasing period, thanks to the cold weather that inhibits shift of households, the occupancy level remained elevated and came in at 94.5% this March, just a notch lower than the prior-year tally of 95%, per the latest report from the real estate technology and analytics firm RealPage, Inc. (RP  -  Free Report).Moreover, solid job growth in recent months indicates more household formations and raises expectations for still healthy apartment market occupancy despite high deliveries in the near term. Also, shortages of construction labor and rising expenses might somewhat impede the growth momentum of supply.Student Housing REITsFor student housing real estate market, there is stability in performance per a report by RealPage. Specifically, an increasing number of giveaways being offered and proximity to campus are aiding the healthy leasing volumes of this sector. Nonetheless, this sector has witnessed slight moderation in rent growth.In fact, with a significant salary differential between college graduates and high-school graduates, college enrolment is set to increase. This will likely drive demand for residential units that are leased by student housing REITs. Also, demand is emanating for on-campus developments from universities that are facing state budget cuts and low funds. And on-campus housing usually enjoys full occupancy.Office REITsIn the office sector too, though supply of new office space has slightly pushed up vacancy levels (by 20 bps) to 13.3% in Q1, per a CBRE Group data, demand for high-quality, efficient space remains strong. This is indicated by the pre-leasing of around 70% of space being delivered in Q1.While higher construction with increased completions might moderate the pace of growth in the primary markets, suburban markets are likely to excel with increased population and growth in employment. Per the data from CBRE Group, for the fifth straight quarter, annual rent growth in suburban markets (2.3%) surpassed that of the downtown markets (0.2%).Hotel REITsIn case of hotel REITs too, an improving economy, growth in employment and rise in wages are likely to drive demand for hotels. Particularly, improved business travel demand with lower cancellations and higher group spends, plus strong demand from leisure division signal better prospects for hotel REITs.Mixed-Use Developments Mixed-use developments have gained immense popularity in recent years. Such developments lower the distance between housing, workplaces, retail businesses, and other amenities and destinations. Hence, such developments enable companies to grab the attention of people who prefer to live, work and play in the same area — a trend that drove development in several other cities in the United States. In recent years, retail REITs like Regency Centers Corp. (REG  -  Free Report) and Federal Realty Investment Trust (FRT  -  Free Report) also directed their investments toward such projects.Healthcare REITsDemand for healthcare real estate is expected to increase considerably on favorable demographics. This is because the senior citizen population is growing at a faster rate than other adults, calling for a greater healthcare needs. Along with an aging population and cost containment, less expensive delivery settings and new technologies, demand for medical office buildings, outpatient facilities as well as urgent-care facilities is growing.Moreover, university-based life science real estate has grabbed attention. In fact, increasing longevity of the aging U.S. population, along with biopharma drug development growth opportunities, have promoted institutional life science and medical-market fundamentals. Further, long-lease terms and top-rated, institutional quality tenants assure steady growth in cash flows for health care landlords.Stocks to Add to Your PortfolioSpecific REITs that we prefer include Chatham Lodging Trust (CLDT  -  Free Report), New Residential Investment Corp.

601,CBRE,"We are in one of the busiest weeks of the current reporting cycle, and it’s natural for investors to be lured by big profits and huge surprises of companies that have already released their quarterly numbers. But instead of accumulating the stock later, investing in ones that are poised for a beat can be far more rewarding. This is because earnings beats essentially raise investors’ confidence in a stock and results in further price appreciation.And if you believed that the rate hike in March and projections for the number of increases this year and in the next have put REITs in the back foot, then perhaps you need to reconsider. Because not only have the REITs made their balance sheets less leveraged, they have locked in the low rates by borrowing at a fixed rate and extending the average maturity of their debt outstanding to more than six years. This financial flexibility is encouraging down the line for their operational efficiencies.Moreover, high consumer confidence in an improving economy and job market gains are fueling consumption levels. In fact, with one eventually requiring “real space” for economic activities, prospects of the real estate sector are getting a boost as growth in the economy translates into greater demand for real estate and higher occupancy levels.Particularly, consider the industrial REITs where availability fell for 31 straight quarters to 7.3% for the U.S. industrial market in first-quarter 2018, per a study by the commercial real estate services firm — CBRE Group Inc. (CBRE  -  Free Report). High consumption levels, strengthening e-commerce market, and a healthy manufacturing environment amid a recovering economy and job market are fueling demand.Also, despite several preeminent retail bankruptcy filings and record-high defaults by retail corporates, recent data from Reis shows that for the neighborhood and community shopping centers, the vacancy rate remained moderately unchanged at 10% for first-quarter 2018.This stability clearly reflects the concerted efforts of the retail landlords to boost productivity of retail assets by trying to grab attention from new and productive tenants. Also, with limited retail supply, refurbishment of existing properties is gaining traction. Retail REITs are now avoiding heavy dependence on apparel and accessories, and rather expanding dining options, opening movie theaters, offering recreational facilities and opening fitness centers in particular.Moreover, in the national apartment market, despite high supply and a seasonally slow first-quarter leasing period, thanks to the cold weather that inhibits shift of households, occupancy level remained elevated and came in at 94.5% this March, just a notch lower than the prior-year tally of 95%, per the latest report from the real estate technology and analytics firm — RealPage, Inc. (RP  -  Free Report). This is clearly reflective of decent apartment demand.In the office sector too, though the supply of new office space has slightly pushed up occupancy levels (by 20 bps) to 13.3% (per CBRE Group data), demand for high-quality, efficient space remains strong. This is indicated by the pre-leasing of around 70% of space being delivered in Q1. Also, improved business travel demand with lower cancellations and higher group spends, plus strong demand from leisure division signal better prospects for hotel REITs.The Zacks MethodologyHowever, in spite of the drivers, choosing the right stock could be quite difficult unless one knows the proper method. To make the task simple we rely on the Zacks methodology, combining a favorable Zacks Rank — Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — and a positive Earnings ESP.Our proprietary methodology, Earnings ESP, shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate.

Backed by improved demand for its properties, the company recently issued a better outlook for its first-quarter results.Pebblebrook Hotel Trust is set to report results on Apr 26.Preferred Apartment Communities, Inc.

602,CBRE,"We are in the heart of the Q1 reporting cycle and the real estate investment trust (REIT) space is buzzing with activity. In fact, there is a deluge of Q1 earnings releases lined up for this week, of which AvalonBay Communities, Inc. (AVB  -  Free Report), Duke Realty Corporation (DRE  -  Free Report), Public Storage (PSA  -  Free Report) and UDR Inc. (UDR  -  Free Report) will release quarterly numbers on Apr 25.Rate hike and cautious approach of investors have affected returns from this industry, so far, this year. However, with underlying asset categories and the location of properties playing a crucial role in determining REITs’ performance, not all players in the space are equally poised to excel or fall behind this season.Per a study by the commercial real estate services firm — CBRE Group Inc. (CBRE  -  Free Report) — availability fell for 31 straight quarters to 7.3% for the U.S. industrial market in first-quarter 2018. The figure not only marked a contraction of 6 basis points (bps) sequentially, but also shrunk 20 bps, year over year, on average, across 50 markets that are followed by CBRE. Moreover, net asking rents inched up 1.9% in Q1 to $7.01 per square foot, denoting the highest mark since CBRE started following the metric in 1989. High consumption levels, strengthening e-commerce market, and a healthy manufacturing environment amid recovering economy and job market are fueling demand.However, the latest report from the real estate technology and analytics firm — RealPage, Inc. (RP  -  Free Report) — states that the national apartment market moderated in the Jan-Mar quarter. Nevertheless, the first quarter marks a slow leasing period, thanks to the cold weather that inhibits shift of households and limits growth in demand.Going by statistics, annual rent growth shrunk to 2.3% in Q1. This marked moderation from the 2.6-2.9% growth rate experienced throughout 2017. Occupancy level of 94.5% this March edged down from the prior-year tally of 95%, with metros having subdued construction activity faring well and recording the strongest occupancy. Nevertheless, the overall occupancy level is still healthy.Furthermore, the self-storage industry is anticipated to experience solid demand backed by favorable demographic changes, improving job market and rising incomes, as well as events like marriages, shifting, death, and even divorce. Also, due to shorter leasing periods, this REIT has the power to adjust its rents quickly to any rate hike.Therefore, let’s have a close look at the factors that will impact the above-mentioned REITs’ first-quarter results.AvalonBay Communities Inc.Residential REIT AvalonBay is well poised to grow on the back of rising demand from household formation and favorable demographics. Additionally, increasing consumer confidence driven by job growth, higher wages and a healthier balance sheet promises brighter prospects for this Arlington, VA-based REIT. Amid these, the company is likely to continue experiencing high occupancy.However, there is an increasing apartment supply in a number of markets of the company. This high supply is expected to have put pressure on rental rates in the to-be-reported quarter. In addition, there is high-concession activity amid elevated supply, which remains a concern.  (Read more: AvalonBay to Post Q1 Earnings: What's in the Cards?)In a March-issued operating update for the first quarter, AvalonBay stated that it expects total rental revenues for established communities to be up 2.3-2.4% year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter revenues is $558.5 million, denoting an expected increase of 6.9% year over year. Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for funds from operations (FFO) per share is pegged at $2.18, indicating projected increase of 4.3% year over year.Moreover, our proven model does not conclusively show that AvalonBay is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a bullish Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here, as you will see below.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.In fact, though AvalonBay has a favorable Zacks Rank of 3, its Earnings ESP of -0.28% makes surprise prediction difficult.Moreover, AvalonBay has a mixed surprise history, as evident from the chart below:AvalonBay Communities, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  AvalonBay Communities, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | AvalonBay Communities, Inc. QuoteDuke Realty CorporationIn recent years, Duke Realty has made concerted efforts to enhance its industrial portfolio. Admittedly, this asset class has been witnessing improving fundamentals amid economic recovery and growth of e-commerce business. This is spurring demand for warehouse space as companies are compelled to enhance and renovate their distribution and production platforms, helping the industrial real estate market to record growth.Nonetheless, Duke Realty is enhancing its portfolio mix through continued divestitures, which includes the significant disposition of sub-urban office assets and medical office buildings. While such efforts are a strategic fit for the long term, the near-term dilutive effect on earnings cannot be bypassed. Furthermore, the company faces significant competition from developers, owners and operators of the commercial real estate. This influences its ability to attract and retain tenants at relatively higher rents than its competitors. (Read more: Duke Realty to Post Q1 Earnings: What's in the Offing?)The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter revenues is currently pegged at $183.8 million, indicating a decline of 15.7% year over year. Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share is 30 cents, pointing to an estimated year-over-year decline of 6.3%.Although Duke Realty has a favorable Zacks Rank of 3, its Earnings ESP of -1.70% lowers chances of any positive surprise this season.The story about Duke Realty’s decent surprise history is better told by the chart below:Duke Realty Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Duke Realty Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Duke Realty Corporation QuotePublic StoragePublic Storage is one of the largest owners and operators of storage facilities in the United States. High brand value, strategic acquisitions, robust presence in key cities and healthy balance sheet serve as major growth drivers for the company. The company is likely to be able to achieve reasonable rate hike for its existing customers. In addition, acquisition and expansion initiatives are anticipated to stoke growth.Amid these, the company remains well poised to record growth in revenues. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $668.9 million, depicting projected rise of 3.6%. Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share is currently pegged at $2.46, indicating an expected rise of 5.1% year over year.Nevertheless, supply has been rising in a number of markets and this adversely affects the company’s pricing power. In fact, it operates in a highly fragmented market in the nation, with intense competition from numerous private, regional and local operators. This, in turn, limits the company’s power to raise rents and turn on more discounting. (Read more: Public Storage to Post Q1 Earnings: What's in Store?)Moreover, with an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and a Zacks Rank of 3, our proven model does not conclusively show that Public Storage will likely beat estimates this season. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The company has a mixed surprise history that is depicted by the graph below:Public Storage Price and EPS Surprise  Public Storage Price and EPS Surprise | Public Storage Quote UDR Inc.UDR boasts a vast experience in the residential real estate market. Additionally, it has a superior portfolio in targeted U.S. markets and adheres to disciplined capital allocation. These are likely to drive results in the to-be-reported quarter. Specifically, the company is predicted to benefit from favorable demographic trends. There is a steady demand for rental apartments from both new millennial households and empty nesters. Along with this, the healthy job market is estimated to drive demand for apartments.However, the company has been dealing with escalating deliveries in a number of its markets. This remains a concern as elevated levels of supply curtail landlords’ ability to demand higher rents and result in lesser absorption. Consequently, concession levels are estimated to have remained at the higher end, while UDR’s pricing power might have been limited in the quarter. (Read more: UDR to Post Q1 Earnings: What's in Store for the Stock?)The Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share for the soon-to-be-reported quarter is pegged at 47 cents. This indicates a 4.4% increase year over year. For the first quarter, management projects FFO per share of 46-48 cents. Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter revenues is pegged at $253 million, indicating year-over-year improvement of 3.8%.Although UDR has a favorable Zacks Rank of 3, its Earnings ESP of -0.30% lowers chances of any positive surprise this season.The story about UDR’s surprise history is better told by the chart below:United Dominion Realty Trust, Inc.

603,CBRE,"Have you been paying attention to shares of CBRE Group (CBRE  -  Free Report)? Shares have been on the move with the stock up 0.4% over the past month. CBRE hit a new 52-week high of $48.44 in the previous session. CBRE Group has gained 10.6% since the start of the year compared to the -1.6% move for the Finance sector and the 0.9% year-to-date return for its peer group.What's Driving the Outperformance?The stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises, having beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on February 8, 2018, CBRE Group reported EPS of $0.99 versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.93 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 5.53%.For the current fiscal year, CBRE Group is expected to post earnings of $3.06 per share on $15.64 billion in revenues. This represents a 12.92% change in EPS on a 10.05% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $3.3 per share on $16.67 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 7.58% and 6.63%, respectively.Valuation MetricsCBRE Group may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for CBRE? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.CBRE Group has a Value Score of B. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are B and C, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of B.In terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 15.6X current fiscal year EPS estimates. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 12.1X versus its peer group's average of 13.6X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 1.2. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.CBRE Group, Inc. Price and Consensus  CBRE Group, Inc. Price and Consensus | CBRE Group, Inc. QuoteZacks RankWe also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, CBRE Group currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to favorable earnings estimate revisions from covering analysts.Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if CBRE Group passes the test. Thus, it seems as though CBRE shares could have a bit more room to run in the near term.

604,CBRE,"We often judge a company on the basis of its sales and earnings numbers. These, however, may not be enough. Sometimes, a stock gets a boost if these numbers climb year over year or surpass estimates in a particular quarter. This will definitely be a great opportunity for an investor with a shorter horizon to cash in on. But if you seek long-term returns, investments backed only by sales and earnings numbers may not yield the desired results.A critical analysis of a company’s financial background is a prerequisite for an informed investment decision. Here, coverage ratios that determine whether a company is sound enough to meet its financial obligations play a crucial role. The higher the ratio, the better it is. The focus of this article is on “Interest Coverage,” which is one such ratio.Interest Coverage Ratio = Earnings before Interest & Taxes (EBIT) divided by Interest Expense.Why Interest Coverage Ratio?Interest Coverage Ratio is used to determine how effectively a company can pay the interest charges on its debt.Debt, which is crucial for most of the companies to finance operations, comes at a cost called interest. Interest expense has a direct bearing on the profitability of a company and its creditworthiness depends on how effectively it meets interest obligations. Therefore, Interest Coverage Ratio is one of the important criteria to factor in before making any investment decision.Interest Coverage Ratio suggests the number of times the interest could be paid from earnings and gauges the margin of safety a firm carries for paying interest.An interest coverage ratio lower than 1.0 implies that the company is unable to fulfill its interest obligations and could default on repaying debt. A company that is capable of generating earnings well above its interest expense can withstand financial hardships. Definitely, one should also track the company’s past performance to determine whether the interest coverage ratio has improved or worsened over a period of time.The Winning StrategyApart from having an Interest Coverage Ratio that is more than the industry average, adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a VGM Score of A or B to your search criteria should lead to better results.Interest Coverage Ratio greater than X-Industry MedianPrice greater than or equal to 5: The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.5-Year Historical EPS Growth (%) greater than X-Industry Median: Stocks that have a strong EPS growth history.Projected EPS Growth (%) greater than X-Industry Median: This is the projected EPS growth over the next three to five years. This shows that the stock has near-term earnings growth potential.Average 20-Day Volume greater than 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.VGM Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential. Here are five of the 20 stocks that qualified the screening:EMCOR Group, Inc. (EME  -  Free Report), which provides electrical and mechanical construction and facilities services, has a VGM Score of B and an expected EPS growth rate 15% for 3-5 years. The stock currently sports a Zacks Rank #1. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.CBRE Group, Inc.

(ARW  -  Free Report), which provides products, services and solutions to industrial and commercial users of electronic components and enterprise computing, has a Zacks Rank #2 and a VGM Score of A. The expected EPS growth rate for 3-5 years is currently 10.1%.Steel Dynamics, Inc.

605,CBRE,"Sales growth is an important metric for any company, as it is a vital part of growth projections and instrumental in strategic decision-making. It provides an insight into product demand and pricing power. By monitoring this key metric over multiple time periods, one can easily understand a company’s growth trend.Sales growth is important to justify the fixed and variable expenses incurred to operate a business. Low revenues lead to an unprofitable business and disappointing financial performance. Stagnant companies may generate near-term profit but can’t rev up enough growth to attract new investors.Also, in a growing economy, lack of sales growth most likely denotes that the company is not gaining market share over its competitors. In simple terms, some sustained sales growth is essential to support the bottom line.Focusing solely on sales growth is not enough though. A healthy sales growth rate is certainly a positive indicator for picking good stocks, but it does not ensure profits. So, taking into consideration a company’s cash position along with its sales number can prove to be a more dependable strategy.Substantial cash on hand and a steady cash flow give a company more flexibility with respect to business decisions and potential investments. Cash also enables a company to endure market downturns. Most importantly, a sufficient cash position indicates that revenues are being channelized in the right direction.Picking the Winning StocksIn order to shortlist stocks that have witnessed impressive sales growth along with a high cash balance, we have selected 5-Year Historical Sales Growth (%) greater than X-Industry and Cash Flow greater than $500 million as our main screening parameters.But sales growth and cash strength are not the absolute criteria for selecting stocks. So, we added certain other factors to arrive at a winning strategy.Price-to-Sales (P/S) Ratio less than X-Industry: This metric determines the value placed on each dollar of a company’s revenues. The lower the ratio, the better it is for picking a stock since the investor is paying less for each unit of sales.% Change F1 Sales Estimate Revisions (4 Weeks) greater than X-Industry: Better-than-industry estimate revision has often been seen to trigger an increase in stock price.Operating Margin (Average Last 5 years) greater than 5%: Operating margin measures how much every dollar of a company's sales translates into profits. A high ratio indicates that the company has good cost control and sales are increasing faster than costs, an optimal situation for the company.Return on Equity (ROE) greater than 5%: This metric will ensure that sales growth is translated into profits and the company is not hoarding cash. A high ROE means the company is spending wisely and is in all likelihood profitable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.

606,CBRE,"If the rate hike in March and projections for the number of increases this year and in the next have made investors skeptical about their investment in the REIT industry, then perhaps this is the right time to reconsider.This is because total returns from REITs not only rebounded in March, but also outshined the S&P 500’s gain. Particularly, according to REIT.com, the broadest index of the U.S. REIT industry — the FTSE Nareit All REITs Index — locked in a gain of 3.74% in the month, while the S&P 500 incurred a loss of 2.54%.While REITs’ dependence on debt for business and the fact that these are considered bond substitutes, for their high and consistent dividend-paying nature, made investors skeptical, it seems that they are now thinking otherwise. Rather, they are emphasizing individual market dynamics which end up playing a crucial role in the performance of REITs.For example, take the industrial REITs which registered 4.59% growth in March. Per a study by the commercial real estate services firm — CBRE Group Inc. (CBRE  -  Free Report) — availability fell for 31 straight quarters to 7.3% for the U.S. industrial market in first-quarter 2018. The figure not only marked a contraction of 6 basis points (bps) sequentially, but also shrunk 20 bps year over year, on average, across 50 markets that are followed by CBRE.Admittedly, this asset class is witnessing improving fundamentals amid economic recovery and growth of e-commerce business. This is driving demand for warehouse space as companies are compelled to enhance and renovate their distribution and production platforms.Particularly, with a larger customer base, e-commerce boom and heightened urbanization, companies are shifting their strategy toward services like same-day delivery and other such options, propelling demand for modern distribution facilities. Also, last-mile properties are witnessing a solid rise in asset values.And why not! According to a report from Prologis Inc. (PLD  -  Free Report), for a given level of revenues, online retailers require three times the distribution-center space compared with traditional retailers. This is surely spurring demand for industrial space.In fact, despite supply picking up pace, demand remains robust, creating scope for rental rates to grow in several markets. This is offering significant impetus to industrial REITs like Prologis, Duke Realty Corp. (DRE  -  Free Report) and Liberty Property Trust (LPT  -  Free Report) to flourish.Further, a healthy manufacturing environment, a recovering economy and job market gains are likely to drive demand from other sectors besides e-commerce. So, shareholders of such REITs have sufficient reasons to rejoice.Currently, Prologis, Duke Realty and Liberty Property Trust carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and have a projected growth rate of 4.6%, 4.4% and 6%, respectively.
