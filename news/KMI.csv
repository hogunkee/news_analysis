0,KMI,"Canada will buy Kinder Morgan (KMI) Canada Ltd.'s Trans Mountain oil pipeline and its controversial expansion project for C$4.5 billion ($3.5 billion) in a bid to ensure it gets built amid fierce opposition.XFinance Minister Bill Morneau and Natural Resources Minister Jim Carr announced the plan Tuesday in Ottawa. ""It must be built and it will be built,"" Morneau said. The deal, which includes the expansion, related pipeline and terminal assets, is expected to close in August. Construction will continue through the 2018 season, and the federal government will transfer it to one or more new owners when ""appropriate.""Buying the pipeline outright had become increasingly likely after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau first pledged only to backstop it. ""We are going to get that pipeline built,"" Trudeau said Tuesday morning as he headed into a meeting with his cabinet.The purchase marks a stunning development for Trudeau's government -- effectively nationalizing the country's highest-profile infrastructure project until an operator can be found. The project has been beset by legal uncertainty and rising protests from environmental groups and the province of British Columbia. It will be a key test of Trudeau's bid to balance the environment and the economy by backing the C$7.4 billion pipeline expansion while pushing a national carbon price to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.Canada first offered earlier this month to indemnify the expansion project before making Tuesday's announcement. The plan includes the existing pipeline that's been in operation since 1953.The plan announced Tuesday has several stages -- construction will continue this year with a Federal loan guarantee as the deal is finalized; the government will look for a new owner or owners to transfer the project to; and then ""indemnify"" the owner against certain costs.Calgary-based Kinder Morgan Canada, a unit of the Houston-based parent, was little changed at C$16.59 in Toronto trading Monday, for a market value of C$5.76 billion. Shares were halted on Tuesday pending the announcement, and the company was due to hold a call after Morneau announcement.The two sides had been in talks since the company set a May 31 deadline for the government to give certainty in the face of opposition from British Columbia, which is concerned about increased tanker traffic and possible oil spills along the Pacific coast. Trudeau pledges regularly that the pipeline will be built.The Trans Mountain expansion would almost triple capacity to 890,000 barrels of oil on a line running from Alberta to a terminal near Vancouver. The 980-kilometer (600-mile) expansion is seen by the oil industry as a crucial link to Asian markets, allowing producers to diversify away from the U.S., which takes the vast majority of Canadian oil exports.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Energy Stocks And Industry NewsBest Growth Stocks To Buy And Watch: See Updates To IBD Stock ListsStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

"
4,KMI,"After four straight record years for dividend payouts, investors should expect muted payout growth, due in part to a sagging energy sector. This month could show the first monthly decline in the indicated rate — which forecasts the total dividends paid per share on a stock over the next 12 months if each were the same as the most recently paid out dividend — in more than five years.U.S. copper miner Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) this month suspended its per-share payout of 20 cents after slashing its dividend yield from 7% down to 1% earlier this year. Also in December, energy pipeline operator Kinder Morgan (KMI) hacked its dividend by 75%.While a stalling indicated rate may be a short-term blip, average dividend growth is decelerating, coming in just a shade under 10% as of Monday, down from last year's 12.7% increase, according to data compiled by S&P Dow Jones Indices.Excluding companies that at least doubled their dividends, the average hike for S&P 500 companies this year is 13.1%. Last year, it was 17.5%, and in 2013 it was 20.4%.'A Bit More Cautious'""Companies are a bit more cautious,"" said Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst for S&P Dow Jones Indices. ""The increases might slightly continue to decline, hopefully not as much.""As of Dec. 22, the $44.112 per share for indicated dividends — implying a payoff of slightly more than 2.1% per share — is only a fraction above November. If that turns out to be a decline once December numbers come in, it would be the first such decrease since February 2010.After taxes, corporate profits fell 1.7% in the third quarter, the Commerce Department said. Since dividends are paid out via earnings, companies are finding themselves in a position of wariness. With after-tax profit margins at historic highs and labor markets tightening, corporations will struggle to boost earnings amid sluggish global economic growth.December Dividend HikesDespite decelerating increases, 2015 stands to be a record year in terms of dividend payouts: $383.4 billion, a 9.2% increase over 2014. Amgen (AMGN), Boeing (BA) and Walt Disney (DIS) all announced big increases in December alone. Amgen is hiking its annual payout by 26.6% to $4 a share, Boeing 19.8% to $4.36 and Disney 7.6% to $1.42.Provided that the oil market doesn't fall apart, dividends should increase in the mid-single-digit percentage range, Silverblatt added.It shouldn't come as a big surprise. The big weight on dividends is an obvious culprit: energy, walloped by falling crude oil prices. U.S. crude traded at $105.24 per barrel on June 30, 2014. Earlier this month, it traded below $35 per barrel, hitting lows not seen since the Great Recession. Accordingly, energy has been the worst-performing sector among S&P 500 companies over the past year.One result has been the dreaded dividend cuts. Year to date, S&P energy issues have cut dividends by $6.2 billion, according to Silverblatt. During the previous five years combined, they cut dividends by $1.3 billion.Oil Majors Preserve DividendsWhile the likes of Freeport and Kinder Morgan already have slashed dividend payouts, large oil companies are staying the course. Exxon Mobil (XOM), Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) and Chevron (CVX) have maintained their dividends this year despite oil's ongoing price decline, choosing to cut capital spending instead.""Cutting a dividend is the kiss of death,"" Silverblatt said.Master limited partnerships — popular investment vehicles for energy pipeline and storage companies — had a rough year as prices for oil and other commodities sank. One barometer for the sector, the Alerian MLP (AMLP) exchange traded fund, has tumbled 34% this year.Corporate America's favorite short-term earnings fix, the stock buyback, should continue as companies are sitting on $1.3 trillion in cash, enough for buybacks and dividends, Silverblatt added. Continuing pressure from activist investors and other shareholders will only add to the practice of companies repurchasing their own shares.In general, stocks haven't had an outstanding year. Unlike the double-digit increases investors saw in 2013 and 2014, the Standard & Poor's 500 index generally has been flat for 2015, as the winners and losers have evened out the market.""If I were a stock picker, this was my year either to buy a summer house or live in a tent,"" Silverblatt said.

46,KMI,"A barrage of energy-industry news drove oil stocks to the head of the market over the past week, sending oil prices to their best week since April, and their best monthly advance since April 2016.U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate was up more than 8% for the week, trading above $74 a barrel for the first time since November, 2016. Brent crude gained 5%, holding just below the $80 mark.The result sent oil-related industry groups to five of the market's 10 largest gains for the week. Deep sea drillers Transocean (RIG), Ensco (ESV) and Noble (NE) scored gains between 8% and 16%. Among domestic producers, EOG Resources (EOG), Concho Resources (CXO) and RSP Permian (RSPP) were among the biggest winners.The June 22 meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries set the stage for the week's price gains.

Privacy Policy & Terms of UseMany oil industry analysts had feared the group, along with partner countries led by Russia, would boost production quotas by a million barrels per day or more — a move that could have risked an oil price crash. Instead, OPEC agreed to a nominal 600,000 bpd increase. That wasn't the 500,000 or less that oil traders had hoped for, but it was bullish enough.Oil prices began surging Tuesday, after a U.S. State Department official told reporters that global oil buyers would be required to cut imports from Iran to zero by November. Buyers who failed to respect the rule would face harsh U.S. sanctions. Iran exports more than 2 billion barrels per day to countries including China, India and Turkey.Also on Tuesday, uncertainty increased regarding oil exports out of Libya. New reports said a Libyan militia leader had handed control of some of the country's largest export terminals to a Benghazi-based rival of the state-owned oil company.Oil prices received a data squeeze on Tuesday and Wednesday, as both the American Petroleum Institute and the Energy Information Administration reported draws of more than 9 million barrels on U.S. oil inventories in the week ended June 22. That was nearly double the industry's expectations.The broader energy market received another heads up on Tuesday, as the annual gas report from the Paris-based International Energy Agency said China was poised to become the world's largest importer of natural gas by next year. The report forecast the country's imports of liquefied natural gas would rise 82% by 2023. Global LNG imports over that same period were forecast to increase 29%.Bloomberg followed up with a report that Qatar Petroleum planned to invest $20 billion in U.S. oil and gas projects over the next five years. In addition, Chief Executive Officer Saad Sherida al-Kaabi said the company — the world's largest seller of LNG — planned to invest an additional $5 billion in other related U.S. projects, such as chemicals.On the domestic front, pipeline heavyweight Kinder Morgan (KMI) said its Texas Pipeline subsidiary would partner with Apache (APA) and a unit of Blackstone Energy Partners to develop a $2 billion Permian Highway Pipeline Project.

47,KMI,"HOUSTON — Plains All American Pipeline (PAA) has $1.5 billion in projects that use a lot of steel, including 26-inch pipes that can only be imported, CEO Greg Armstrong said Monday, as industries weigh the impact of the Trump administration's planned steel and aluminum tariffs.X Only three places in the world make that kind of steel pipe, and none of them is the U.S., he said at the CERAWeek 2018 energy conference.While it's still ""very early"" to see how much the tariffs would hurt, Armstrong said ""it's a thornier issue than I think is printed in the headlines."" But he added that Plains All American also buys valves that aren't made in the U.S.Having enough pipelines isn't just important to pipeline operators. Oil producers rely on them to get the products to customers, who are increasingly overseas since the federal government lifted the ban on U.S. exports of domestic crude.Armstrong noted that a lot of the oil from the prolific Permian Basin will be exported to international customers.""I don't think it would be appropriate to put a tariff on something you can't get in the U.S.,"" he said. ""If you can't get what you need, you've got to go somewhere else.""Pipeline companies are also especially dependent on imports. An ICT International study conducted for the pipeline industry found that 77% of the steel used in pipelines in recent years was imported, according to Bloomberg.Shares of Plains All American closed up 2.9% at 21.94 on the stock market today, retaking their 50-day average, amid reports that Republicans in Congress have come out in opposition to the tariffs.

62,KMI,"Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) and other major fund managers snapped up tech stocks like Apple (AAPL), Facebook (FB) and Twitter (TWTR) during the final quarter of 2017.X Berkshire Hathaway bought 31.2 million shares of Apple in Q4, according to a 13F filing released late Wednesday. That raised its Apple holdings by 23.5% to 165.3 million shares, making Apple a top stock investment in a portfolio to which investors at large look for inspiration. Berkshire first bought Apple in 2016 and it has been steadily growing that holding.New buys included Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA), in which the Buffett-led conglomerate disclosed an 18.9 million share stake. A notable sell was IBM (IBM), with Berkshire slashing its remaining stake in the tech giant by almost 95% to 2 million shares.It was otherwise a mostly quiet quarter for the Oracle of Omaha, with major holdings in Bank of America (BAC), Wells Fargo (WFC) and Coca-Cola (KO) generally unchanged even as questions have swirled about how Berkshire will put its $100 billion-plus cash hoard to work.Shares of Apple rose 3.4% on the stock market today, retaking their 50-day moving average. Teva jumped 8.6%. Bank of America rose 0.7%, IBM gained 0.8%, and Berkshire's B shares added 1.7%.IBD'S TAKE: The stock market has been very volatile lately.

His Bank of America holdings increased by 171% to 17.2 million shares. He opened new positions in Caesars Entertainment (CZR) at roughly 54.9 million shares and MGM Resorts International (MGM) at 2.3 million shares.Tepper cooled on the energy sector, offloading his entire stake in Kinder Morgan (KMI) and Chesapeake Energy (CHK) — which fell in Q4 despite a surge in oil prices. He also dumped the underperforming Whirlpool Corp. (WHR) and General Motors (GM), whose 2% gain over the quarter lagged the S&P 500's 6% gain.David Einhorn's Greenlight Capital also looked to financials and tech.

65,KMI,"Gasoline prices across the U.S. are expected to climb even higher as the remnants of Hurricane Harvey continue to pound Houston and keep much of the Gulf Coast's refining capacity offline.XThe U.S. national average gasoline price was $2.31 per gallon Monday, up five cents from a week ago and up a penny from Sunday, according to GasBuddy.Prices are expected to go higher, from 7 to 15 cents the next two weeks with another increase if refineries are closed longer than two weeks, Patrick DeHaan, a senior petroleum analyst at GasBuddy, told MarketWatch.The price spike comes after 10 refineries, including Exxon Mobil's (XOM) Baytown, Royal Dutch Shell's (RDSA) Deer Park and Valero's (VLO) Corpus Christi refineries, responsible for an estimated 2.2 million barrels of daily capacity were closed ahead of the hurricane, according to S&P Platts.Gasoline futures for September delivery was up 2.7% to $1.712 a gallon, after spiking 5% earlier.

66,KMI,"Oil majors Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) as well as a slew of energy companies are gushing their best profits in years, yet crude prices are plunging again to levels last seen in November, clouding the outlook for dividends.Will glimmers of a profit recovery in the troubled energy sector mean a rush to plow money back to shareholders? Or will weakness in oil prices keep shareholder returns muted?""First and foremost, oil prices need to improve"" before the energy sector's dividends and buybacks return to historical levels, said Lindsey Bell, investment strategist at CFRA Research. ""Energy earnings are very highly correlated to energy prices. With oil prices at $45 a barrel, it will be very hard for those stocks to perform.""Grant Engelbart, a portfolio manager at CLS Investments, agrees that rebounding oil prices will be key to energy companies' profitability — and therefore their ability to pay dividends and buy back shares.At the same time, he notes that no energy company has actually cut dividends this earnings season and a few — including Exxon, Phillips 66 (PSX) and Cabot Oil & Gas (COG) — actually raised dividends.""We think dividend cuts have probably come to an end, and companies that have mandates to raise dividends will continue to do so,"" Engelbart said in a phone call.The latest reports reveal energy companies have done a good job navigating the new landscape by cutting back expenditures during the price bust and holding off on massive outlays with the rebound, he added.Helped by cost cuts, Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) pumped out $9.5 billion in cash flow, which the Anglo-Dutch giant used to cover dividends for a third straight quarter and reduce debt in Q1.Yellow flags remain. Revenue for Exxon was worse than expected in the first quarter, and Chevron kept its dividend unchanged even as Exxon raised its payout. The two companies alone account for nearly 40% of the S&P 500 energy sector's market cap.The energy sector will also face tougher year-over-year comparisons over the course of 2017, making earnings growth less dramatic.Oil and gas companies floundered in the ugly commodity collapse of 2014-15. By early 2016, with a hoped-for rebound yet to materialize and their profits cratering, the likes of ConocoPhillips (COP), Kinder Morgan (KMI), Anadarko Petroleum (APC)  and Chesapeake Energy (CHK) were forced to slash dividend payouts.  In some cases, as stock prices plunged, dividend yields spiked as much as 12%.Even Exxon, the world's biggest oil company, was forced to borrow money to pay out dividends. Smaller-cap energy companies struggled the most to increase or maintain their dividend payments.Share buybacks, a form of shareholder returns that is easier for companies to turn on and off than dividends, were pared back even more.For 2016 as a whole, the energy sector represented 1.1% of all S&P 500 buybacks vs. 2.7% in 2015 and 7.4% in 2014, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. It contributed 9.1% to S&P 500 dividends  in 2016 vs. 10.56% the previous year.In the fourth quarter of 2016, the combined dividend yield and buyback yield for the energy sector was 3.19% — the lowest of all 11 S&P 500 sectors.Exxon, which has grown dividends for 35 years in a row, is now no longer the biggest dividend payer in the S&P 500.Apple (AAPL), which started paying dividends in 2012 and has been hiking payouts aggressively, is the new king. The iPhone maker on May 2 hiked its quarterly dividend by 10.5% to 63 cents, taking its annual dividends to $13.22 billion vs. $12.77 billion for Exxon.Still, dividend yields for energy stocks are more attractive. With Apple stock hitting new highs, the dividend yield is just 1.6%, less than half of Exxon's 3.7% and Chevron's 4%.Apple also has replaced Exxon as ""the poster child for buybacks"" in recent years, according to Howard Silverblatt of S&P Dow Jones Indices. Apple buybacks in 2016 totaled $33.71 billion, making it the second largest S&P 500 company for buybacks, behind Allergan (AGN).Meanwhile, Exxon did not even rank among the top 20 and ""has done very little in the way of buybacks of late,"" Silverblatt wrote recently.Despite some recent good news for shareholders, current prices don't bode well for revenue or payouts.U.S. crude prices settled 3.2% higher Wednesday at $47.33 a barrel, on data showing a sharp drawdown in U.S. inventories. Meanwhile, OPEC and top non-OPEC producers have suggested they will extend production cuts through the end of this year and possibly into 2018.Prices could get a bump from new, aggressive moves by the oil group and its partners to further reduce the global glut of inventories. But that would likely be offset by increased production from U.S. companies.Still, while the top line remains challenged, companies could improve their bottom lines — and their cash flow — by focusing on lower-cost regions like the Permian Basin. U.S. producers have also been using new technologies and techniques that allow them to extract oil profitably, even at lower prices.RELATED:Uh-Oh, OPEC: Top Shale Play Vows Big Output Boost Even With Sub-$50 OilEOG Shows Why It's The 'Apple Of Oil' With Gusher Of Mobile Apps, DataEven This Latest Idea From OPEC May Not Lift Oil Prices As Shale Looms

68,KMI,"President Donald Trump's decision to revive TransCanada's (TRP) Keystone XL pipeline may herald a new era of pipeline abundance for Canadian oil producers after years of bottlenecks, while lowering the discount on the region's crude.The U.S. president signed documents to advance the project Tuesday, more than a year after his predecessor, Barack Obama, rejected it on grounds it would contribute to climate change. The decision follows the Canadian government's approval in November of Kinder Morgan's (KMI) Trans Mountain line to the Pacific and Enbridge's (ENB) expansion of Line 3 to the U.S. Midwest.The three lines would add 1.8 million barrels a day of crude export capacity, enough to handle Western Canada's growing oil production for 20 years, according to National Energy Board projections.That would add more than $4 billion a year to Western Canada's economy by making the region's crude more valuable relative to other grades, Tim Pickering, founder and chief investment officer of Auspice Capital Advisors Ltd. in Calgary, said in a phone interview. Because of the lack of capacity, refiners haven't paid as much for Canadian crude.""Too much capacity is not a big concern for the Canadian marketplace and producers right now,"" Pickering said. ""It gives us room down the road to increase production.""Canadian oil producers such as Suncor Energy (SU), Cenovus Energy (CVE) and Imperial Oil (IMO) have sold their heavy crude at discounts to West Texas Intermediate futures of as much as $40 a barrel in recent years amid constraints in pipeline space. Western Canadian Select's discount to West Texas Intermediate crude averaged about $14 a barrel over the past year, data compiled by Bloomberg show. That may shrink to $5 to $7 a barrel should all three lines get built, Pickering said.More pipelines from Canada would also ""generate greater competition for crudes of comparable quality such as those imported from Mexico or Venezuela,"" Harry Tchilinguirian, head of commodity-markets strategy at BNP Paribas in London, said in an instant message.The administration moved to expedite approval and construction of the Keystone XL pipeline as well as the Dakota Access line through North Dakota. Trump said he wanted to renegotiate terms to get a better deal for the U.S., including more U.S.-made materials in the lines.The 830,000-barrel-a-day Keystone XL has been blocked since it was first proposed in 2008. TransCanada said in a statement it will reapply for the project.The approval of Keystone XL and other lines ""will mean better netbacks to producers,"" Tim McMillan, chief executive officer of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers, said in a phone interview Tuesday. ""It's really just a more efficient system for our economy.""Kinder Morgan's TransMountain line and Enbridge's Line 3 are scheduled for completion by the end of the decade, both companies have said. TransCanada also plans to build the Energy East line from Alberta to the Atlantic Coast.The pipelines may be more than the industry needs, according to Wood Mackenzie.""While we forecast continued growth in Canadian oil production; there might be too much pipe if Trans Mountain Expansion and Line 3 Replacement (approved in Nov 2016) and Keystone XL all start up by 2020,"" according to a note Tuesday from analyst Afolabi Ogunnaike. ""At best we would expect TransCanada to build Keystone XL or Energy East but not both.""Trans Mountain, which still faces at least two legal challenges, has the added advantage of opening up access to Asian markets for Canadian crude. Canada now sells nearly all its oil to the U.S.""Our view has been first of all that we need to diversify our markets, we can't rely on one market and one market only,"" Alberta Premier Rachel Notley told reporters in Edmonton on Tuesday.TransCanada has declined to comment on the timing of construction. In a best-case scenario, work could start this year, Dennis McConaghy, former executive vice president of corporate development at the company and a current shareholder, said by phone.

"
85,KMI,"The fast-moving boom in unconventional gas and oil production has altered the pipelines sector, once a slow-changing, utility-grade investment. New pipelines are being built and existing lines reversed to serve an evolving map of opportunities.
"
86,KMI,"A large share of those lines has come under ownership of master limited partnerships (MLPs), a tax-advantaged business model luring income investors with large cash distributions, much like dividends.
"
87,KMI,"In August, early MLP adopter Kinder Morgan Energy Partners (KMP) abandoned the business model in order to gain more financial and operational flexibility. Hinds Howard, a vice president and assistant portfolio manager at CBRE Clarion Securities and a long-time specialist in the MLP space, discusses the causes behind Kinder Morgan's move, the ripple effects upon other MLPs and the general status of the MLP sector.
"
88,KMI,"IBD: What were some of the reasons behind Kinder Morgan shedding its MLP format?
"
89,KMI,"Hinds Howard: The problem was that they had grown so much so fast. For many years, they were the fastest-growing MLP out there in terms of distribution per unit. The way MLPs are restructured is: the faster you grow your distribution per unit, the faster you run up the ladder of the set of distribution rights (to the general partner).
"
90,KMI,"KMP had grown so much from such a small base that the GP, Kinder Morgan Inc. (KMI), was receiving 44% of all cash distributions. So in order for KMP to grow its distribution $1, it had to make $2 of distributable cash flow — and that's a problem.
"
91,KMI,"IBD: So how does that compare to other MLPs out there? Are there others at risk of being forced to make the same sort of move?
"
92,KMI,"Howard: There are other MLPs that will eventually have that problem, but it was compounded at the KMP level because KMP was so big. Kinder Morgan bought a $5 billion company (Copano, in May 2013), and it didn't move the needle at all. If you are doing $5 billion acquisitions that don't have much of an impact, it can be really hard to grow.
"
93,KMI,"(Among other MLPs,) Plains All American (PAA) may be the closest; maybe they are around 40% in terms of cash that goes to the GP. But nobody is close to the 45% cash to the GP that Kinder was. (Plains' distribution/dividend yield is near 4.4%, vs. 5.8% for Kinder Morgan.)
"
94,KMI,"Enterprise Products Partners (EPD) had the same problem (as KMP). They solved it by buying their GP, by internalizing it, several years ago. Other MLPs have also done that: Magellan Midstream (MMP), Buckeye Partners (BPL)...
"
95,KMI,"IBD: Will the KMI/KMP restructuring have any impact on the MLP space?
"
96,KMI,"Howard: Yes, it will. It will have an impact on the indexes (that track MLPs) and on the funds that flow into the sector. Another factor is that a lot of the KMP unit holders were investors from early on who had such a low (cost) basis in their stock. So people that ordinarily would never have sold their Kinder Morgan are now being forced to sell. They will face huge tax consequences, and they will be forced to go out and find a new place for their capital.
"
97,KMI,"(The KMP/KMI restructuring) is bullish for the sector just from a technical standpoint.
"
98,KMI,"In terms of indexes and people who can sell their units and move on to another MLP, and just the way Kinder is talking about buying other MLPs — (all this) will have a positive impact on the sector.
"
99,KMI,"IBD: So, beyond Kinder Morgan, where does the MLP space stand at this point? Is it maturing?
"
100,KMI,"Howard: We've never had as much visibility in terms of distribution growth as we have now. MLPs are less and less reliant on acquiring other companies — on these crapshoot M&A auction processes. They are more and more reliant on clear and visible production growth, and you have several years of cap ex plans to look at.
"
101,KMI,"So you can see more clearly now than you could in the past that distributions are going to be sustainable at a higher rate for longer. What that means is that is starting to get priced in. People are more and more comfortable with MLPs, as a sector, growing 6% to 8% a year.
"
102,KMI,"So their multiples are going up. That means it's getting harder and harder to find value in the sector, but fundamentally things are moving in the right direction.
"
103,KMI,"IBD: What is your outlook here? How should investors moving into MLPs in the coming year look at the space?
"
104,KMI,"Howard: In general, the MLPs that will do fine are the ones that are already at premiums. Those will continue to grow. But some of that growth is already baked in, so if you want to really outperform, it's going to have to come from one of three categories.
"
105,KMI,"The best-performing MLP in the next 12 months will probably be one that has underperformed in the last 12 months. Boardwalk Pipeline Energy (BWP) partners, for example, cut its distribution (in February), and it's already up 50% plus since its bottom off that cut (with its yield at 2.2%).
"
106,KMI,"The second bucket will be some recent IPO. High-growth MLP IPOs have done phenomenally well: names like Valero Energy Partners (VLP) and Phillips 66 Partners (PSXP).

Kinder Morgan ended Tuesday 39% off a late January low, back above its 10-week moving average and 65% below its April 24 high.At the bottom of the S&P 500, Cerner (CERN) tanked 13% after its fourth-quarter revenue and earnings squeaked past consensus views, but the top end of its Q1 EPS guidance just met consensus estimates.  The stock has been in a deepening slump for 10 months.Shopify (SHOP) charged up 18% after narrowly beating analysts' Q4 earnings estimates, but booking a 99% revenue gain -- well ahead of expectations.

114,KMI,"Dividend ETFs have been on a roll in an unsteady stock market. Investors are betting on value companies with strong brands and stable businesses to ride out the volatility.They aren't just seeking quality, however. They're reaching for equity income as portfolio returns start to look anemic.ALPS Sector Dividend Dogs (SDOG) zoomed 8% higher in the past month through Feb. 22, outpacing virtually every peer in the U.S. dividend stock ETF category.By comparison, Vanguard Dividend Appreciation (VIG), the largest exchange traded fund in this group, rose 5%.SDOG yields 3.77% vs. 2.39% for VIG.Smart investors, however, make sure their reach doesn't exceed their grasp.Some of the highest-yielding dividend ETFs are loaded with energy stocks. The sector's a fount of attractive income, but bear in mind that yields have risen as share prices of oil and gas companies have fallen.Falling earnings makes those tasty dividends susceptible to big cuts.""Companies with more volatile cash flows and/or excessive leverage are more likely to cut their dividends in a downturn,"" Morningstar analyst Michael Rawson wrote in a July report.The oil patch offers solid proof.Kinder Morgan (KMI) slashed its dividend by 75% late last year amid the slump in oil prices.Anadarko Petroleum (APC) slashed its dividend by 81% earlier this month to boost its cash reserves. Anadarko, an oil exploration and production company, lowered its dividend to 5 cents per share from 27 cents per share.ConocoPhillips (COP) cut its dividend by 66% recently too -- two months after saying that the “dividend remains the highest priority use of our cash.”The question many are asking is: Could oil majors Exxon Mobil (XOM) and BP (BP) be next?Against this backdrop, ETF investors would be wise to look under the hood of their investment.VIG, an ETF focused on stocks that grow dividends, has a 1% exposure to the energy sector. That's hardly alarming.By comparison, SDOG allocates 10% of portfolio assets to the energy sector.Another high-yielding ETF, WisdomTree High Dividend (DHS) has a 15% energy weighting. DHS yields 3.63%.Even some ""core"" dividend ETFs may have a significant stake in energy.For iShares Core High Dividend (HDV), it's 21%. Exxon Mobil is its largest stock holding out of 75.For Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity (SCHD), it's 11%. The ETF offers a high dividend yield without a tilt toward distressed stocks, making it suitable as a core portfolio holding.HDV yields 3.91% and SCHD 3.04%.Both fell on the stock market today.Image provided by Shutterstock.

The Kinder Morgan/El Paso pairing, expected to be completed in the second quarter next year, will create the largest North American pipeline network — 67,000 miles — under a single roof.
"
163,KMI,"At one end, many of those miles reach into newfound shale-producing regions. At the other, they pipe gas and refined products to shipping terminals, refineries and vast markets in the Northeast, Midwest and West and Gulf Coast regions.
"
164,KMI,"But investors who take a closer look quickly find Kinder Morgan's pipelines don't appear to be gathered under a single roof.
"
165,KMI,"Kinder Morgan is actually a constellation of companies with three publicly traded operations specifically related to the El Paso deal. Each of the those, Kinder Morgan, known as KMI, Kinder Morgan Energy Partners (KMP) and Kinder Morgan Management (KMR), bear different corporate structures.
"
166,KMI,"The arrangement offers what the company describes as ""different ownership interests in the same set of assets."" Analyst Mark Reichman with Simmons & Co. International says the three simply allow different types of investors alternative ways to play a fast-growing, high-cash-flow piece of the U.S. pipeline sector.
"
167,KMI,"Executive management at all three companies is identical, led by Richard Kinder in the chairman and chief executive role. C. Park Shaper is president and Steven Kean is chief financial officer. Other top executives are also the same, although board to board, some directors differ.
"
168,KMI,"The 66-year-old Kinder is an ex-Enron executive who lost a bid for that company's CEO seat when Enron opted to downscale its pipeline business. Kinder left the company in 1996, partnered with William Morgan, and began buying pipeline operations from Enron and others.
"
169,KMI,"Kinder and Dan Duncan, the founder of Enterprise Products Partners (EPD), pioneered the use of master limited partnerships to unlock the value of those assets. Similar to a real estate investment trust, the partnerships pass the bulk of their cash flow through to investors as a distribution, or dividend. That cash flow is not taxed at the corporate level. For investors, that means a bigger piece of the company's total take.
"
170,KMI,"For energy companies, it provides a way to move pipeline assets off the books and into tax-free settings.
"
171,KMI,"Quarterly filings from all three Kinder Morgan companies describe the same assets: 38,000 miles of natural gas and product pipelines (pre-El Paso) and 180 terminals. In reality, those assets are actually housed in the MLP, Kinder Morgan Partners (KMP), the hub of the Kinder Morgan complex.
"
172,KMI,"""It's what I would consider the operating partnership,"" Reichman said.
"
173,KMI,"While they don't actually own assets, KMI and KMR were created to benefit from different types of ownership interests in the master limited partnership, KMP. Kinder Morgan Management — KMR — was launched in 2001. It was an early effort, Reichman says, to open a door to institutional investors who faced strict federal limits on owning MLPs. Structured as a limited liability corporation, KMR owns a limited partnership interest in KMP.
"
174,KMI,"But rather than receiving and distributing cash, KMR receives and passes through a quarterly dividend in shares known as paid-in-kind distributions. This delivers a gradually increasing share of KMP ownership. KMR and its shareholders aren't taxed on those distributions until the shares themselves are sold.
"
175,KMI,"The passage of the American Jobs Creation Act in 2004 eased restrictions, allowing mutual funds and institutions to place up to 25% of their asset value in MLPs. It also allowed funds to own as much as 10% of a single MLP.
"
176,KMI,"That, to some degree, infringed on KMR's appeal as an institutional tool, Reichman said. Still, nearly 60% of KMR shares are owned by funds and institutions, even though the stock trades at about a 9% discount to KMP.
"
177,KMI,"KMI is also an attempt to channel more pipeline asset value to investors. The company, which returned to public ownership in February after being taken private by Kinder in 2007, owns the general partner's share of KMP. (It also owns a 20% interest in the Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America, which links Texas' Permian Basin and the Gulf Coast to Chicago.)
"
178,KMI,"Completion of the El Paso deal would shift El Paso's pipeline assets and its ownership in its own MLP, El Paso Pipeline Partners (EPB), to KMI.
"
179,KMI,"""It is the two C corps (as opposed to MLPs or limited partnerships) that are merging,"" explains Jim Baker, executive director of Kayne Anderson's closed end funds, ""with the ultimate expectation that El Paso's midstream assets will ultimately be sold to (the underlying master limited partnerships).""
"
180,KMI,"KMI will also assume control of El Paso's exploration and production operations, which it plans to either sell or spin off as a separate entity.
"
181,KMI,"KMI earnings have made triple-digit leaps this year vs. easy comparisons. Earnings forecasts see that growth continuing through the first quarter, then settling into the 40% to 50% range, similar to KMP's forecasts — through 2012.
"
182,KMI,"But dividends are a crucial differentiator. In addition to its general partnership interest, KMI owns all of KMP's incentive distribution rights, or IDRs. So, as the master limited partnership increases its dividend/distribution, the IDRs deliver KMI a gradually expanding share of the cash.
"
183,KMI,"This means that while KMI shareholders receive a smaller absolute dividend than KMP shareholders, that dividend will grow more quickly.
"
184,KMI,"For 2012, KMP expects to declare a cash distribution of $4.98 per unit: an 8.3% increase over its 2011 target of $4.60. KMI expects to declare dividends of $1.35, a 16.4% increase.
"
185,KMI,"""It's the IDRs that drive that growth,"" Reichman said.
"
186,KMI,"Effects of the El Paso deal don't yet appear in KMI's analyst forecasts. And the merger is still in the early stages. Pipelines are gatekeepers that often hold local and regional monopolies on transport and supply and therefore wield crucial control over energy prices. Regulators will comb through the tangle of Kinder Morgan and El Paso assets to sort out concentrations of such control.
"
187,KMI,"Analyst Elvira Scotto with RBC Capital Markets expects the regulatory hurdles to be manageable.
"
188,KMI,"""EP and KMP's natural gas pipeline systems are mostly complementary with minimal overlap, with the exception of the Rockies area,"" she wrote in an October report.Kinder Morgan (KMI) brought the energy trade to brisk attention on Oct. 16, announcing it would pay $21.1 billion to acquire oil producer and pipeline owner El Paso (EP).The deal was the largest energy industry merger since ExxonMobil bought XTO Energy for $41 billion in 2009.

230,KMI,"On Thursday, mobile advertising services firm Millennial Media (MM) jumped 92% after pricing at the high end of views. That's the best debut of the year. Online retailer CafePress rose as much as 19% from its above-range IPO price, but closed up just 3 cents.

255,KMI,"Kinder Morgan Inc. (KMI  -  Free Report) reported fourth-quarter results on Jan 17, kicking off the earnings season for the energy space. Now, oil service companies — providers of technical products and services to drillers of oil and gas wells — are slated to release October-to-December numbers in the coming weeks. These reports are likely to provide a better understanding of the energy sector’s performance this earnings season. In particular, key oil services earnings reports scheduled for release this week and the next are that of Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB  -  Free Report) and Halliburton (HAL  -  Free Report).  The world’s largest oilfield services provider Schlumberger is expected to report on Jan 19, while smaller rival Halliburton will post its fourth-quarter numbers on Jan 22.Here, we take a closer look at which of these stocks is better placed, although both carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The AnalysisWe have assessed the stocks on six parameters.Price PerformanceDuring the fourth-quarter 2017, Halliburton clearly outpaced Schlumberger and the industry in terms of price performance. Halliburton rallied 6.2% against the respective 3.4% and 1.9% declines of Schlumberger and the industry.Free Cash Flow YieldsCompanies with strong operations generally have high free cash flow yield, indicating that the amount of money investors are generating is more than the amount spent on the stock.Our proprietary model shows that free cash flow yield for Halliburton stands at 3.7%, slightly higher than 3.5% of Schlumberger.Earnings History and ESP  Halliburton has an incredible history when it comes to beating earnings estimates. The company has consistently surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings since mid-2014. As far as recent history is concerned, the Texas-based firm delivered an earnings beat in each of the trailing four quarters, the average positive earnings surprise being 41.2%. Meanwhile, Schlumberger has managed to beat earnings in one of the last four quarters, the average positive earnings surprise being a modest 4.2%. Considering Earnings ESP as well, Halliburton is likely to beat earnings in this upcoming quarter. This is because the stock has the right combination of two key ingredients — an Earnings ESP of +0.46% and a Zacks Rank #3.The picture is different for Schlumberger as the stock has an Earnings ESP of -1.87%.Earnings Expectations for 2018The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Halliburton’s 2018 earnings currently stands at $2.19 per share, representing year-over-year growth of 89.1%.For Schlumberger, the same is pegged lower at $2.15 per share, reflecting growth of 47.4%.ValuationHalliburton and Schlumberger are overvalued when compared to the Zacks Oil & Gas–Field Services industry. For this, we have employed the EV/EBITDA (enterprise value to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) ratio, which is often used to value oil and gas stocks, given their significant debt levels and high depreciation and amortization expenses.  With an EV/EBITDA ratio of 18.37, Halliburton is overvalued compared to the industry’s 10.57, though Schlumberger also looks pricey compared to the industry; its EV/EBITDA ratio of 15.98 lends it an advantage over Halliburton.   Dividend Yield & Debt BurdenSchlumberger’s current dividend yield of 2.6% is significantly higher than 1.4% of Halliburton. Also, over the past year, the dividend yield of Schlumberger has been consistently higher than Halliburton.Schlumberger has a lower leverage as evident by its debt-to-capital ratio of 28.4% compared with Halliburton’s 55.6%.Bottom LineHalliburton clearly scores higher in terms of share price movement, earnings surprise history and free cash flow yield. On top of that, the company has a much higher ESP reading of +0.46% as against Schlumberger’s -1.87%.However, Schlumberger holds an advantage when it comes to dividend yield and valuation. The stock also has less exposure to debt.Overall, our comparative analysis shows that Halliburton has an edge over Schlumberger on most of the parameters.Zacks Top 10 Stocks for 2018In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest buy-and-hold tickers for the entirety of 2018?Last year's 2017 Zacks Top 10 Stocks portfolio produced double-digit winners, including FMC Corp. and VMware which racked up stellar gains of +67.9% and +61%.

Moreover, all the three key U.S. indexes settled at new record highs after closing in the red on Tuesday. Additionally, in its Beige Book, the Fed provided an encouraging outlook about the U.S. economy, which in turn also boosted investor sentiment. Both the Dow and S&P 500 posted their best 11-trading day start for the first time in a year since 1987, following which bond yields and the U.S. dollar increased.How the Benchmarks Fared?The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) increased 1.3%, or 321.65 points to close at 26,115.65. The S&P 500 rose 0.9% to close at 2,802.56. The tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index closed at 7,298.28, gaining 1%. The fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) increased 3.2% to close at 12.03.

Additionally, per the Beige Book “employment continued to grow at a modest pace” in majority of the districts. Also, most of the districts reported “modest to moderate price growth,” which boosted sentiment.Higher rate environment and optimism over steady economic growth weighed on bond prices. Lower bond prices supported the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield, which increased from 2.544% to 2.579% on Wednesday. Higher treasury yields generally boost profitability from banks’ lending activities.Following this development, the Financial Select Sector SPDR (XLF) advanced 0.8%. Some of its key holdings, including Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report) and Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) increased 2.2% and 1.4%, respectively.

257,KMI,"Kinder Morgan, Inc. (KMI  -  Free Report) recently announced its intention to restart the construction work for expansion of the Trans Mountain pipeline in August. The project was paused in spring owing to resistance from various provincial governments of British Columbia as well as municipalities, native groups, and environmental activists.Notably, the Canadian government decided to buy the project in late May if Kinder Morgan did not continue with the construction. The pipeline expansion project is a significant one, as the country is suffering from severe bottlenecks.The pipeline runs from Edmonton, Alberta to a port located in Vancouver, from where the products sail for international markets. Due to delay in regulatory approvals, especially from the British Columbia province, the multi-billion dollar expansion project was kept in hold.In Alberta, the construction work of the pipeline will start in August, followed by British Columbia’s North Thompson area in late September. Additional expansion work is expected in British Columbia’s Lower Mainland.Shortage of pipelines and rail transportation has disrupted the production schedule of the oil and gas producing companies in Western Canada. The companies had to slow down their activities due to obstruction in crude transportation.Expansion of the Trans Mountain will provide the producers in the country with better access to global markets, which is in turn is expected to increase the capacity of the pipeline three times. Notably, the Canadian government hankering to buy it for C$4.5 billion ($3.4 billion) from Kinder Morgan to save the project further proves its importance in the country’s oil and gas sector.There are several other projects in the country like Enbridge Inc.’s (ENB  -  Free Report) Line 3 replacement, ranging from Hardisty, Alberta to Superior, WI, which got delayed due to opposition. Another project, TransCanada Corp.’s (TRP  -  Free Report) Alberta-to-Nebraska Keystone XL pipeline is facing considerable objection.Price PerformanceHeadquartered in Houston, TX, Kinder Morgan is engaged in energy transportation and storage in North America. The company has lost 8.4% in the past year compared with 9.9% fall of its industry.Zacks Rank and a Stock to ConsiderKinder Morgan currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Investors interested in the energy sector can opt for a better-ranked stock like CNOOC Limited (CEO  -  Free Report), sporting Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Hong Kong-based CNOOC is an integrated energy company. The company’s top line for 2018 is anticipated to improve 64.4% year over year, while its bottom line is expected to increase 124.3%.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest Strategies It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

258,KMI,"Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (APC  -  Free Report) announced that its subsidiary, DBM Oil Services, LLC (DBMOS), is holding a binding open season to find out the viability of its high-vapor-pressure oil-gathering and treating system serving portions of Reeves, Loving, Ward and Winkler Counties in West Texas.The new system will have a gathering capacity of 400,000 barrels of oil per day (bopd) and an initial treating capacity of 120,000 bopd by the end of 2018. Subject to increase in demand, the treating capacity to could be raised further to 180,000 bopd per day in 2019.Open Season The increasing Exploration & Drilling activities in the Permian Basin of West Texas no doubt create opportunity for midstream service providers. Anadarko, through its subsidiary, is planning to gain from the likely increase in demand for gathering and treating services.The open season in a way will help to justify the company’s midstream investment to expand infrastructure in the Permian basin to support future growth. Subject to completion of the open season, the system is expected to be become operational from second-quarter 2018.Increasing investment in the midstream activities will help Anadarko boost its midstream earnings.Permian Basin Production to RisePermian Basin is rich in reserves and expected to drive the United States crude oil production in 2017. Per a recent release from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, U.S crude oil production will average 9.4 million barrels per day (MMbpd) in the second half of 2017 — 340,000 bpd more than in the first half of 2017.Permian production is forecasted to grow to 2.6 MMbpd in the second half of 2017, a 260,000 bpd increase from the first half.We expect production from the Permian Basin to improve further over the long run creating ample opportunity for the midstream services. So the rising possibilities in the region have already resulted in other successful open season from midstream service providers.In April 2017, Kinder Morgan, Inc. (KMI  -  Free Report) and DCP Midstream, LP (DCP) announced that they have signed a letter of intent for the development of the proposed Gulf Coast Express Pipeline Project. This Kinder Morgan project will transport increased natural gas production from the Permian Basin to growing markets along the Texas Gulf Coast. The project is designed to transport up to 1,700,000 dekatherms per day (Dth/d) of natural gas through the 430 miles of 42-inch pipeline from the Waha area to Agua Dulce, TX.In second-quarter 2017, Energy Transfer Partners, L.P. (ETP  -  Free Report) announced the completion of successful open season for its Permian Express 3 Pipeline. Permian Express 3 is expected to provide transportation of up to 100,000 barrels per day, with service commencing in the fourth quarter of 2017. The company will conduct another season to find prospective customers to transport another 200,000 barrels per day from this region.Another pipeline operator Plains All American Pipeline (PAA  -  Free Report) announced a binding open season for committed crude oil transportation from the Permian Basin to the Corpus Christi/Ingleside area. The company plans to develop two pipelines, one extending from Wink South to McCamey, TX, and the second pipeline will extend from McCamey to the Corpus Christi/Ingleside area.Price MovementAnadarko has gained 10.9% in the last three months, outperforming 7.4% rally of the industry it belongs to.Zacks RankAnadarko currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

259,KMI,"Wall Street ended Monday on a disappointing note as all three major stock market indexes declined significantly. Investors’ apprehensions about a trade war between the United States and China as well as with European Union have shaken market confidence. President Trump’s protectionist policies against key trading allies of the United States have generated severe market volatility. Although, yesterday’s decline was broad-based, the technology sector suffered maximum brunt of it. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) closed at 24,252.80, declining 1.3% or 328.09 points. The S&P 500 Index (INX) also decreased 1.4% to close at 2,717.07. The Nasdaq Composite Index (IXIC) closed at 7,532.01, losing 2.1% or 160.81 points. A total of 7.74 billion shares were traded on Monday, higher than the last 20-session average of 7.32 billion shares. Decliners outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 3.29-to-1 ratio. On the Nasdaq, decliners had an edge over advancers by 3.24-to-1 ratio.  The CBOE VIX increased 25.9% to close at 17.33, its highest level in nearly a month.  How Did the Benchmarks Perform?The Dow shed 1.3%, its biggest one-day drop since May 29. The blue-chip index closed at its lowest level since May 4. Moreover, the Dow ended below its 200-day moving average, a psychological barrier to gauge its long-term momentum trends. This happened for the first time since June 2016. Notably, 26 of the 30-stocks index closed in the red while 4 traded in the green.The S&P 500 dropped 1.4%, its biggest daily decline since April 6. This was also the index’s lowest close since May 31. During yesterday’s trading, the benchmark index fell below its 50-day moving average. However, it recovered from there and finally closed above the technical barrier.The S&P 500’s decline was primarily led by 2.2% loss of the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR (XLY), 2.1% decrease of both Communication Services Select Sector SPDR (XLC) and Technology Select Sector SPDR (XLK) and 2% decline of Energy Select Sector SPDR (XLE). Notably, nine out of 11 sectors of the benchmark index ended in negative territory.Nasdaq Composite decreased 2.1%, reflecting the index’s second straight losing session and its biggest one-day percentage loss since Apr 6. Large-cap tech behemoths and semiconductor stocks suffered significantly which pushed the tech-heavy index in the negative territory. Global Trade War Fears Intensify Ongoing trade related conflicts between the United States and its major trading allies like China, European Union, Canada, Mexico, to name a few are worsening day by day. Trade conflict between the United States and China has heightened to a position that imposition of tariffs and retaliatory traffic may go up to $450 billion on either side. In addition, President Trump desire to restrict Chinese companies to invest in U.S. tech firms block technology export to China by any U.S. companies will further escalate the tensions.Moreover, Trump has indicated that United States may impose 20% tariffs on auto imports from the European Union (EU) as a retaliatory move of EU’s decision to impose tariffs on U.S. auto exports.Yesterday, stock price of motorcycle giant Harley-Davidson Inc. (HOG  -  Free Report) declined 5.8% after the announcement that the EU tariff on its motorcycles has been raised to 31% from 6%. The company plans to shift production of EU-bound motorcycles to international facilities from U.S. facilities to avoid the tariff burden. Harley-Davidson carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Technology Sector Plunges on Trade Concerns  On Jun 24, The Wall Street Journal reported that president Trump is planning to impose more restrictions on Chinese companies. Per the report, any company with 25% or more Chinese ownership will be barred from investing in any U.S. tech companies. Likewise, U.S. tech companies will not be allowed to export technology to China.On Monday, the technology sector suffered a severe blow as China is the most lucrative market for tech behemoths. U.S. tech giants operating in the fields of smartphone, software and Internet-based services, online video streaming and social networking generates a large chunk of their revenues from China. Moreover, China accounted for over 50% revenues for some of the leading semiconductors developers.China is sure to take retaliatory measures against U.S. restrictions which will significantly affect the business model of these large tech companies. Consequently, Netflix Inc. (NFLX  -  Free Report) declined 6.5%, its biggest drop since July 2016. Other FAANG stocks also follow suite. Leading tech stock Stitch Fix Inc. (SFIX  -  Free Report) plunged 11%. Semiconductor majors like Micron Technology Inc. (MU  -  Free Report) and NVIDIA Corp.

260,KMI,"The U.S. Department of Justice (""DOJ"") recently vowed to take legal action against protesters and activists who damage oil pipelines and other energy infrastructure. The verdict came in response to the letter sent by more than 80 U.S. representatives inquiring whether the activists who damaged energy infrastructure in October 2016 could be charged under the domestic terrorism law. The letter, which was sent to Attorney General Jeff Sessions, is still under review.  In support of the question raised by the representatives, DOJ stated that the damage done by activists could disrupt services and consequently affect people’s lives. The damages can also burden taxpayers and even put lives at risk. The damaged pipelines can also hurt the environment. The DOJ’s decision can increase the persisting tension between climate activists and the administrative board.Although the DOJ’s legal actions will lead lawmakers to distinguish between lawful and unlawful protests, the department is yet to shed light on last year’s events where activists protested in four states. The protestors twisted shut valves on a few pipelines, which were responsible for crude oil imports from Canada. The Climate Direct Action group said that the action was in favor of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe. The tribe has been vocal about the Dakota Access Pipeline operated by Energy Transfer Partners LP (ETP  -  Free Report), as it can cause damage to the tribe's burial ground and pollute its waters. The controversial pipeline has witnessed protests since the time it of its planning. Energy Transfer started construction of the pipeline in June 2016 with oil and gas companies like Phillips 66 (PSX  -  Free Report), Enbridge Inc. (ENB  -  Free Report) and Marathon Petroleum Corporation (MPC  -  Free Report) as minor partners. There are cases where activists have been recognized and penalized for their actions. A protestor was sentenced for 32 days for illegally tampering with a Kinder Morgan (KMI  -  Free Report) pipeline in Washington. The construction of the Atlantic Sunrise Pipeline by Williams Partners L.P. (WPZ  -  Free Report) through Lancaster County also faced protests. Recently, five protesters were arrested in Martic Township for creating obstacles at the construction site.What Lies Ahead?Instances of damage to energy infrastructure are expected to go down following the decision taken by the DOJ. The actions will also assure oil and gas companies of the safety of their assets. However, the decision may ignite another controversy regarding protests against climate changes.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest Strategies It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

261,KMI,"TransCanada Corporation (TRP  -  Free Report) recently announced plans to terminate its mega project Energy East Pipeline as well as Eastern Mainline Project owing to regulatory hurdles and prolonged delays.Energy East Pipeline was touted as a major transformative project for the development of Canada’s future energy by Alberta’s energy minister and industry players. However, it hit a roadblock due to the stringent policies issued by the National Energy Board (NEB) on Aug 23. The board initiated a tougher review process for the Energy East Pipeline and Eastern Mainline Projects.The board announced that the approval process for the projects will now involve the examination of greenhouse gas emissions at both upstream and downstream stages. NEB felt that the expanded scope of the review will provide more visibility in the assessment of risks related to causalities like oil spill, among others.Concurrently, last month TransCanada filed an application with the NEB to stall the federal review of the projects for 30 days.  After re-evaluating the commercial viability of the project, the company decided to call off the same owing to persistent uncertainties and challenges including the anticipated cost overruns that would be incurred with the latest NEB policies.Eastern Mainline — a 279 kilometer pipeline — was to connect Markham and Edwardsburgh.  Energy East Pipeline was expected to carry crude from Alberta and Saskatchewan to eastern Canadian refineries .The pipeline was expected to provide Western Canada’s producers an alternative route to transport 1.1 million barrels of oil per day. However, with the project getting terminated, producers will now have to bank on Enbridge Inc.’s (ENB  -  Free Report) Line 3, TransCanada’s Keystone XL and Kinder Morgan Inc.’s (KMI  -  Free Report) Trans Mountain pipeline for transporting fuel. With energy demand and supply in Western Canada looking promising at present, the termination of this project signals the country’s failure to tap significant growth opportunities.With the project getting scrapped, TransCanada will incur a non-cash charge of $1 billion in the fourth quarter. Apart from affecting the company adversely, the termination of the project will also lead to potential loss of jobs and investment opportunities in Atlantic Canada.Zacks Rank and Other Stock to ConsiderHeadquartered in Alberta, TransCanada mainly focuses on natural gas transmission and power services. Its pipeline transports the majority of Western Canada's natural gas to growing markets in Canada and the United States. The company currently sports a Zacks Rank #1(Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. The company has an impressive pricing strength and has outperformed the broader industry over the last six months.

262,KMI,"Midstream service provider Targa Resources Corp. (TRGP  -  Free Report) recently announced the completion of the sale of 25% joint venture interest in the Grand Prix natural gas liquids (""NGL"") pipeline to private equity giant Blackstone Energy Partners. Simultaneously, Targa completed a deal with a portfolio company of Blackstone, EagleClaw Midstream Ventures, LLC. Also, Targa signed a letter of intent (""LOI"") with energy infrastructure provider Kinder Morgan (KMI  -  Free Report) and DCP Midstream, LP (DCP  -  Free Report) for jointly developing the proposed Gulf Coast Express Pipeline Project.Blackstone DealThe Grand Prix pipeline will connect Permian Basin in west Texas and New Mexico to Targa’s plant in Mont Belvieu, east of Houston. The pipeline will transport volumes from the Permian Basin and the company’s North Texas system to its fractionation and storage complex in the NGL market hub at Mont Belvieu. Targa expects Grand Prix’s transport capacity to be approximately 300,000 barrels per day (bpd), expandable up to 550,000 bpd. The pipeline is expected to come into service in the second quarter of 2019.Targa expected the total capital expenditure associated with the Grand Prix project to be around $1.3 billion, out of which the company was supposed to spend approximately $250 million in 2017. The deal with Blackstone is expected to help Targa make ample net capital savings. It will also provide Targa financial and strategic benefits. Grand Prix is likely to enhance the company’s ability to move customer volumes from the wellhead in the Permian Basin and North Texas to key petrochemical and export markets.EagleClaw AgreementThe EagleClaw deal supports a long-term Raw Product Purchase Agreement. Per the agreement, EagleClaw will receive transportation and fractionation services from Targa, as committed before, for the private natural gas gathering and processing company's Delaware Basin production. The deal is expected to provide Targa with long-term progressive fee-based cash flow.Gulf Coast Express Pipeline ProjectThe project will serve the growing need for Permian Basin natural gas in the Texas Gulf Coast key markets. The pipeline will likely have the capacity to carry 1.92 billion cubic feet of natural gas every day, which is likely to commence operations by the second half of 2019. Kinder Morgan will construct and operate the pipeline project with a 50% stake. Targa Resources and DCP Midstream are each expected to have 25% ownership in the pipeline.About Targa ResourcesHeadquartered in Houston, TX, Targa Resources Corp owns general and limited partner interests in Targa Resources Partners LP.

Moreover, the top line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3,482 million. The downside can be attributed to higher expenses and lower contributions from the CO2, Terminals and Products Pipelines segment.DividendKinder Morgan raised quarterly dividend to 20 cents per share (80 cents per share annualized) from 12.5 cents in the preceding quarter. This represents an increase of 60% and is in line with the company’s plans announced in 2017. The dividend is payable on May 15, to shareholders on record as of Apr 30.Segment AnalysisNatural Gas Pipelines: Operating income from this segment was $1,136 million, up 8% from $1,055 million in the year-ago quarter. Higher contribution from the Texas Interstate System and favorable outcome from El Paso Natural Gas (EPNG) as well as Florida Gas Transmission Pipeline led to the improvement. The growth came from various midstream gathering and processing assets, including Hiland, due to higher drilling activity.CO2: The segment reported earnings of $199 million, which fell 19% from $218 million in first-quarter 2017. Lower commodity prices were responsible for the downside.Terminals: This business unit reported profit of $295 million, which declined 4% from $307 million in the January-March quarter of 2017, mainly due to divestitures and lower contributions from existing Jones Act tankers due to lowered charter rates.Products Pipelines: This segment recorded earnings of $259 million, down 10% year over year.Kinder Morgan Canada: The segment reported earnings of $46 million, which increased 7% from $43 million in first-quarter 2017.

264,KMI,"Kinder Morgan, Inc. (KMI  -  Free Report) is going through a roller coaster ride with its Trans Mountain expansion project in Canada, where political uncertainty is playing a major role in deciding its future. Recently, the company received assurance from the Canadian government that losses related to politically-triggered delays in the project will be covered.As the future of the project seemed in jeopardy, the company started to rethink over the matter. Kinder Morgan was thinking of walking away from the project if further delays would hamper the company’s plans. The recent bottleneck situation in Canada’s pipelines has forced the government to take steps in this expansion project. The New Democratic Party led government of British Columbia, however, criticized the decision. The party has support from the Green Party, an environment-focused federal political party in Canada.Kinder Morgan — having already suspended any unnecessary spending on the project — stated that it has planned to abandon the project if the future of Trans Mountain still remains in the dark after May 31. Notably, Canada has suffered from five major pipeline project-scrapings due to delays, in the last three years. Currently, there are other pipeline projects in the country that are stuck with their progress like TransCanada Corporation’s (TRP  -  Free Report) Keystone XL pipeline and the Line 3 replacement project of Enbridge Inc. (ENB  -  Free Report).Canadian Finance Minister, Bill Morneau stated that if Kinder Morgan leaves the Trans Mountain project, the government will be ready to provide the financial assurances as and when any company steps in to take over. These measures mark the importance of the C$7.4 billion ($5.8 billion) project to the Canadian energy sector. The Canadian unit of Kinder Morgan owns the 1,150 km Trans Mountain Pipeline, which carries crude and refined oil from Alberta to the west coast of British Columbia. The new development will likely help Kinder Morgan to carry 890,000 barrels a day of crude from Edmonton, Alberta, to Barnaby, British Columbia.Price PerformanceHeadquartered in Houston, TX, Kinder Morgan is engaged in energy transportation and storage in North America. The company has lost 15.9% in the past year against 15% growth of its industry.Zacks Rank and Another Stock to ConsiderKinder Morgan currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Investors interested in the Energy sector can opt for a better-ranked stock in the same space like Nine Energy Service, Inc.

266,KMI,"So far in Q1 earnings, 10.4% of the S&P 500 companies have reported results. The total 52 companies belonging to the index saw year-over-year earnings growth of 27.9% on 10.7% higher revenues. Notably, 84.6% of the firms surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings while 78.8% beat the revenue mark.As of now, we have seen only one S&P 500 release from the Energy space — Kinder Morgan, Inc. (KMI  -  Free Report).Energy Sector Likely to Shine BrightFor the first-quarter of 2018, we expect Energy to eclipse all the 16 Zacks sectors, posting earnings growth of 58.6%. For the January-to-March quarter, we project earnings of $14 billion — the highest in the last four quarters.  Importantly, Energy will likely be among the major drivers behind the S&P 500’s year-over-year earnings growth. Excluding Energy, the index’s Q1 earnings growth will likely drop to 16.5% from 17.8%. A favorable Q1 oil pricing scenario is expected to back Energy’s performance. Per the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the average West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude price for the month of January, February and March was reported at $63.70 per barrel, $62.23 and $62.73, respectively. The average oil price never touched $60 in any of the months in the 2015-2017 period, thanks to the extension of OPEC’s production cut deal through 2018-end.Let’s See How SLB & BHGE ere PlacedBoth Schlumberger Limited (SLB  -  Free Report) and Baker Hughes (BHGE  -  Free Report) belong to the Zacks Oil & Gas-Field Services industry, which falls under the Energy sector as well. Both stocks are scheduled to report on April 20, before the opening bell.Let’s employ a few parameters to analyze how the stocks will fare earnings season.Earnings ESP & HistoryEarnings ESP is our proprietary methodology for identifying stocks that have a high chance of surprising in their upcoming earnings announcement. It shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Our research shows that stocks with a combination of a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP, the chance of a positive earnings surprise is as high as 70%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Schlumberger will beat estimates this quarter. This is because the stock has an Earnings ESP of -1.72% and a Zacks Rank #3. Though a Zacks Rank of 3 increases the predictive power of ESP, a negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Baker Hughes is unlikely to beat estimates, since it has a combination of a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and Earnings ESP of -2.94%. This is because we caution against Sell-rated stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Strong Sell) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Schlumberger’s earnings surprise history is impressive. The stock surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the last four quarters, the average positive earnings surprise being 6.4%.The picture is just the reverse for Baker Hughes, with the stock failing to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the past four quarters. The average negative earnings surprise for the last four quarters is recorded at 34.8%.Earnings GrowthWe expect Schlumberger to witness earnings growth of 52% for Q1 2018. Baker Hughes’ projected growth of 250% is much healthier.Price PerformanceSchlumberger stock fell 3.9% during the January-March quarter of 2018, performing better than the respective decline of 7.7% and 12.2% of the industry and Baker Hughes.Bottom LineThe healthy oil pricing scenario is favorable for both the stocks, as oilfield services players are expected to clinch more contracts for setting up oil wells.Although Baker Hughes scores way higher in terms of earnings growth, the stock is unlikely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Meanwhile, Schlumberger has higher chances of trumping estimates.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of All Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce """"the world's first trillionaires,"""" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

267,KMI,"Energy infrastructure provider, Magellan Midstream Partners, L.P. (MMP  -  Free Report) recently reported a gasoline leak of 10,988 barrels or more than 461,000 gallons at its Galena Park terminal near Houston, TX caused by Harvey. The leakage from two gasoline storage tanks above ground is the biggest reported spill in the region caused by the storm. While Magellan Midstream believes the devastating flood caused the spill, it is still looking for the exact reason. The amount of the spill rapidly increased from the partnership's first estimate of 1,000 barrels by 10 times. The spilled fuel reached the waterway near the ship channel, which is a heavily industrialized area with dozens of petrochemical facilities. Some of the gasoline escaped into an adjacent ditch.Due to Harvey, the total amount of fuel leaked in the area– including the one from Magellan Midstream’s terminal – is estimated at 600,000 gallons. Companies that reported such Harvey-stoked leaks in the Houston area include ExxonMobil Corporation (XOM  -  Free Report), Valero Energy Corporation (VLO  -  Free Report), Kinder Morgan, Inc. (KMI  -  Free Report) and others.Risk FactorGasoline is known to be more volatile than oil. Hence, following a spill, it dissolves much faster. It penetrates the soil and contaminates groundwater supplies quickly, which can take a toll on the environment of the nearby area and pose health threats.Steps Taken by MagellanMagellan Midstream contained some of the spilled gasoline that leaked on Aug 31 by spraying foam. This was done to prevent the gasoline mixture from discharging harmful vapors. The partnership is excavating and restoring the affected soil. The whole operation is being monitored by the environmental agencies as further investigation is on.The partnership reported that most of its infrastructure was back to normal after the storm. Its refined products pipeline system that originates in East Houston and connects Dallas and West Texas areas has already come online. It has started the truck loading services in the area on a limited basis.About the Partnership Tulsa, OK-based Magellan Midstream is a master limited partnership (MLP) that owns and operates a diversified portfolio of energy infrastructure assets. The partnership primarily transports, stores, and distributes refined petroleum products and, to a lesser extent, ammonia. Magellan Midstream conducts its operations in three segments: Refined Products, Crude Oil, and Marine Storage.Magellan Midstream’s portfolio of energy infrastructure assets helps it to generate stable tariff-based revenues. However, the refined product demand of the partnership is inherently volatile and is subject to complex market forces.Zacks RankThe partnership has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The dividend is payable on Feb 15 to shareholders on record as of Jan 31, 2018.Segment AnalysisNatural Gas Pipelines: Operating income from this segment was $1,027 million, up 4% from $986 million in the year-ago quarter. The upside can be attributed to improved contributions from TGP owing to incremental short-term capacity sales and projects commissioned. Lower interest expense from Natural Gas Pipeline of America (NGPL) and SNG due to completion of an expansion project is favorable as well. Higher results from the Elba Express pipeline also contributed to the growth.However, an adverse impact on the tariff rates of Colorado Interstate Gas Company pipeline following the rate case settlement in 2016 and disruptions caused by tropical storm Harvey contributed to lower income.CO2: The segment reported earnings of $228 million, which declined 4% from $238 million in fourth-quarter 2016. Lower commodity prices were responsible for the downside.Terminals: This business unit delivered profit of $317 million, which improved 4% from $305 million in the Oct-Dec quarter of 2016, owing to growth in liquids operations.Products Pipelines: This segment recorded earnings of $314 million, up 2% year over year. Higher throughput on SFPP, CalNev and Kinder Morgan Southeast Terminals were responsible for the improvement.Kinder Morgan Canada: The segment reported earnings of $50 million, which increased 22% from $41 million in fourth-quarter 2016. Higher capitalized equity financing costs related to the Trans Mountain Expansion Project, timing of operating costs and foreign exchange effects driven by a stronger Canadian dollar in 2017 boosted growth.Operational HighlightsTotal expenses in the quarter were $2,820 million, up 14.9% from $2,455 million spent in the fourth quarter of 2016.  Operating income of $812 million fell 13.1% from $934.0 million in the year-ago quarter.FinancialsThe company reported fourth-quarter distributable cash flow of $1,190 million compared with $1,147 million in the year-earlier quarter. The increase is mainly attributable to higher contributions from TGP as a result of incremental short-term capacity sales and projects commissioned. Higher income from CO2 and Terminals segment along withhigher volumes also contributed to the growth.As of Dec 31, 2017, Kinder Morgan had $264 million in cash and cash equivalents. The company’s long-term debt amounted to $33,988 million at the end of the quarter.   Price PerformanceInvestor’s optimism on the stock was reflected by its price chart.

269,KMI,"Kinder Morgan Inc (KMI  -  Free Report) is expected to post fourth-quarter 2017 earnings on Jan 17.Last quarter, the company delivered an earnings surprise of 7.1%. Moreover, Kinder Morgan delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 1.8% in the last four quarters. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to the announcement.Which Way are Estimates Treading?Let’s look at the estimate revisions to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company before earnings release.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of 18 cents for the fourth quarter has been stable in the last 30 days. It reflects growth of about 12.5% from the year-ago quarter. Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $3,324 million for the impending quarter, down 0.2% from the prior-year quarter.Factors to ConsiderKinder Morgan has the largest network of natural gas pipelines in North America, spread over almost 70,000 miles. Notably, the company’s midstream properties are linked to all the prospective plays in the United States, which are rich in natural gas.These extensive networks of natural gas pipelines, for which the company has invested billions of dollars, provide stable fee-based revenues. In fact, Kinder Morgan expects 91% of its 2017 cash flow generation to come from fees charged for midstream properties. The revenues from midstream properties will be reflected in the quarterly results.However, Kinder Morgan’s weak balance sheet is a concern. As of third-quarter 2017, total debt — short and long term — is pegged at $38.3 billion. Debt capital is higher than total equity capital of $36.5 billion which depicts the company’s significant exposure to debt. If debt continues to grow, the company may face liquidity issues.Moreover, the company’s Trans Mountain pipeline expansion faces threats. Being a part of the legal dispute, the successful appeal is expected to nullify the federal sanction for the C$7.4-billion or $5.9-billion Trans Mountain project and result in long postponement. This will be a major drawback for the company.Price Performance in Q4During the quarter, Kinder Morgan has underperformed the industry. In the aforesaid period, the stock has lost 5.8% compared with the industry’s decline of 3%. Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Kinder Morgan is likely to beat earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for the company is -1.16%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Kinder Morgan carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Conversely, we caution investors against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell Rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderThough earnings beat looks uncertain for Kinder Morgan, here are some firms that you may want to consider on the basis of our model. These have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Headquartered in Irving, TX, Pioneer Natural Resources Company (PXD  -  Free Report) is an independent oil and gas exploration and production company. The company has an Earnings ESP of +2.45% and sports a Zacks Rank #1. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Headquartered in Houston, TX, Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation (COG  -  Free Report) is an independent oil and gas exploration company with producing properties mainly in the continental United States.

270,KMI,"The Canada-based unit of energy infrastructure provider Kinder Morgan, Inc. (KMI  -  Free Report) recently announced six major contractors for the controversial Trans Mountain pipeline expansion project extending from Alberta to British Columbia.The seven segments of the pipeline from Edmonton, Alberta to the southwest of British Columbia have been covered by a memorandum of understanding (MOU) signed by the company with the contractors, which are expected to operate in partnerships or joint ventures. The contractors will have the authority to employ individuals and sub-contractors to finish the project. It will bring employment opportunities to the locals.While the construction work is anticipated to start this month, most of the work of the pipeline is scheduled for 2018 and 2019. The company expects the expansion work to take around 28 months and the project to start operation before the end of 2019.The development worth C$7.4 billion ($5.9 billion) has received federal and regulatory approvals.However, the pipeline has been the subject of much scrutiny. The alliance of New Democratic Party and Green Party of British Columbia that won the May 9 election poses a threat to the project. Environmental groups and indigenous communities – through whose land the project passes – have also objected. Kinder Morgan, however, believes that the political and environmental oppositions will not hamper the expansion.Kinder Morgan is keeping the expansion project alive amid the negatives through various actions, which do not involve actual pipeline construction work. Recently, the company raised C$5.5 billion ($4.16 billion) from the financial community for the expansion project after filing for an initial public offering (IPO) of restricted voting shares to garner funds. Actions like this are expected to strengthen the company's presence in the Canadian pipeline industry.About the PipelineThe Canadian unit of Kinder Morgan owns the 1,150 km Trans Mountain Pipeline, which carries crude and refined oil from Alberta to the west coast of British Columbia.The construction of the expansion project that could begin in September will help the company to nearly triple the size of the existing pipeline. The new development will help Kinder Morgan to carry 890,000 barrels a day of crude from Edmonton, Alberta, to Barnaby, British Columbia.About the CompanyKinder Morgan is engaged in energy transportation and storage in North America. The company handles energy products like natural gas, refined petroleum products, crude oil, ethanol, coal, and carbon dioxide (CO2). It operates natural gas pipelines in the Rocky Mountains, the Midwest, and Texas as well as refined petroleum products pipeline in North America. Kinder Morgan also operates terminals for the storage of petroleum products and chemicals and CO2 pipelines and oil producing fields. Kinder Morgan is headquartered in Houston, TX.We note that Kinder Morgan is spending significantly on acquisitions and asset expansion, which helps the company to generate high distributable cash flow. Investors should also know that for supporting these investments, the company’s total debt now stands higher than equity capital, reflecting balance sheet weakness.Price PerformanceKinder Morgan has lost 7.6% year to date against 1.8% growth of its industry.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderKinder Morgan currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the oil and energy sector are Lonestar Resources US Inc. (LONE  -  Free Report), Range Resources Corporation (RRC  -  Free Report) and Subsea 7 SA (SUBCY  -  Free Report), each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Lonestar Resources’ sales for 2017 are expected to surge 60.2% year over year. The company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 62.5% in the second quarter of 2017.Range Resources’ sales for the third quarter of 2017 are expected to increase 27% year over year.

271,KMI,"There seems to be no respite for the energy infrastructure master limited partnerships (or MLPs). If the Trump administration's proposed 25% tariff on imported steel were not enough, now midstream network providers have found themselves entangled in an FERC tax ruling, bleeding them even further.The benchmark Alerian MLP Index – tracking 40 partnerships – suffered its worst fall in more than two years on Thursday in a sell-off sparked by concerns of lower tariffs and cash flows. While selling hit most sector constituents, Plains All American Pipeline L.P. (PAA  -  Free Report) and Energy Transfer Partners L.P. (ETP  -  Free Report) were two of the biggest daily percentage decliners.The Business of MLPs & Advantages of The StructureMLPs differ from regular stocks in that interests in them are referred to as units and the unitholders (not shareholders) are partners in the business. Importantly, these hybrid entities bring together the tax benefits of a limited partnership with the liquidity of publicly traded securities. The assets that these partnerships own typically – oil and natural gas pipelines and storage facilities.MLPs represent an attractive investment option for income-focused investors in the current environment. In addition to high yields, MLPs are structured as pass-through entities.This means that they typically distribute nearly all of their cash flows back to unitholders. The MLPs are not required to pay a corporate income tax as the tax liability of the entity is passed on to its owners (or unitholders) in the form of a cash dividend (distribution). This allows the MLPs to offer very attractive yields to the investors.The FERC Tax RulingOn Mar 15, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (‘FERC’) ruled that the interstate oil and natural gas pipelines owned by MLPs can no longer avail a credit for income taxes they do not pay. Revising its 2005 Policy Statement for Recovery of Income Tax Costs, the federal regulators found that the longstanding income tax allowance in their cost-of-service fees could lead to double recovery of costs for the asset class who are pass-through entities not subject to corporate income taxes.The Net Effect of the Policy RevisionLooking ahead, the FERC policy revision signals significant future changes on how the pipeline partnerships will go about treating income taxes in their books of accounts.As mentioned above, MLPs, being pass-through entities, allocates their pre-tax income to unitholders on a proportionate basis. The unitholders are then responsible for paying their own share of the partnership's tax obligation. Therefore, the FERC felt that its 2005 policy on income tax allowance provided the partnerships an unfair benefit, possibly resulting in double recovery of costs and boosting their distributable cash flows.FERC’s recent tax policy change is aimed at addressing this issue. The regulatory body is expected to issue a formal rulemaking guide, outlining the impact of the removal of income tax allowance on interstate pipeline rates.Consequently, partnerships charging cost-based rates for interstate transportation service would have to lower customer tariffs to move oil, gas and refined products around the country by the amount of their income tax allowances - substantial in certain cases. A reduction in cost recovery would likely cut into their cash flows.Impact on MLPSWhile the FERC ruling is definitely a negative for MLPs, it must be remembered that the move will not affect all partnerships and assets. In particular, the changes are not likely to impact pipeline companies that are structured as ‘C-Corporations’ (and not as MLPs) like Kinder Morgan, Inc. (KMI  -  Free Report) and ONEOK, Inc. (OKE  -  Free Report). The federal revision will also not apply to MLPs owning midstream assets that begin and terminate within the same state.On the other hand, MLPs with significant ‘cost-of-service’ exposure and large amounts of interstate pipelines – including Energy Transfer Partners and Spectra Energy Partners (SEP  -  Free Report) – look to be in most trouble. The change in income tax policies will result in rate reduction, and therefore lower cash flow for pipelines owned by these MLPs.That said, all midstream operators with interstate pipelines will not be equally affected by the FERC ruling on tax allowances, with the impact essentially depending on how they charge rates. For example, pipelines under cost-of-service rates will be impacted but those subject to market-based or negotiated tariffs won’t be materially affected.What NextThough a number of MLPs came out with press releases claiming negligible or no material impact from the FERC ruling, the tax policy change has gripped the sector with wide-ranging concerns and uncertainty. With the new rule expected to be adopted only by 2020, the issue may remain a thorn in the flesh for the foreseeable future.Opportunity for Bottom FishingThe speed of Thursday’s jaw-dropping sell-off send MLP investors in a panic. Most of them are still jittery and are waiting for the dust to settle before coming back to the market. In particular, they will be carefully analyzing the partnerships’ press releases related to FERC’s ruling wherein the companies gradually come out with disclosures associated with cost of service exposure and potential impact to their cash flows.However, most analysts saw the broad selling as an overreaction with enough opportunity to wade back in the industry. If you are a savvy investor — meaning you see a buying opportunity when stocks sell off — then it may be time to look at MLPs. One might opt for fundamentally strong names that are not likely to be impacted from the FERC rule change but got unfairly punished when the sector as a whole took a turn lower.We have shortlisted two of them – Calumet Specialty Products Partners, L.P. (CLMT  -  Free Report) and Oasis Midstream Partners L.P. (OMP  -  Free Report) – carrying Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Calumet Specialty Products Partners is a major North American producer of high-quality, specialty products and fuels. The Indianapolis, IN-based partnership makes a significant portion of its money by processing crude oil into lubricating oils, solvents, waxes, and other petroleum products. These activities would experience no impact from the FERC change.Oasis Midstream Partners is primarily focused on production gathering and gas processing. The Houston, TX-based partnership’s tariffs come from its economic interests in gathering pipelines, processing facilities and storage facilities, which will see no material effect from FERC's policy revision.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!

272,KMI,"Independent oil refiner and marketer Andeavor (ANDV  -  Free Report) – formed following the merger of Tesoro Corporation and El Paso-based Western Refining Inc. – recently announced plans to initiate the construction of Conan Crude Oil Gathering Pipeline in West Texas. The news came a couple of days after the company announced its first earnings release under the new name and delivered better-than-expected earnings.The open season for this 130 mile crude oil pipeline in Delaware Basin (located on the western part of the lucrative Permian Basin) had been launched in May by Western Refining. Apart from bolstering its network of assets, downstream operator Western Refining’s buyout is likely to help Andeavor enhance its geographic footprint in the prolific Permian Basin, driving double-digit earnings growth in 2018. As it is, over the last two years despite the industry’s downturn, the energy companies including Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM  -  Free Report),Noble Energy, Inc. (NBL  -  Free Report) and many othershave been increasing their investment in the prolific Permian Basin owing to its lower costs and widespread infrastructure.The pipeline will begin in the Lea County and will extend to the Loving County, where it will join with other pipelines. Conan Pipeline is also expected to connect with the Wink Pipeline – owned by Kinder Morgan, Inc. (KMI  -  Free Report) – and supply the oil to the company’s El Paso Refinery. The first phase of the pipeline will have a transportation capacity of 250,000 barrels per day (bpd), expandable up to 500,000 bpd in the future phases. The company is expected to invest around $225 million in the first phase of the completion of the pipeline, out of which it is likely to spend $75 million this year. The commercial service of the Conan Pipeline is most likely to begin by mid-2018.Zacks' 10-Minute Stock-Picking SecretSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.

273,KMI,"Kinder Morgan Inc.’s (KMI  -  Free Report) $5.8-billion oil pipeline expansion is threatened by the political overtures of British Columbia, which is not in favor of this project and vows to join the legal fight against it by teaming up against Canadian federal approval of the project.The expansion is clouded by political uncertainty of the province of British Columbia through which the pipeline passes. Per the environment minister, a seven-fold increase in heavy oil tankers in B.C.’s coastal waters is a big risk to its environment, economy and to thousands of existing jobs.The current political landscape in British Columbia is fractious and in disfavor of the Trans Mountain Pipeline. Majority of the voters sided with the Alliance of New Democratic Party and Green Party, opposing the Trans Mountain pipeline. The Green Party is trying to avoid risks connected with the transportation of diluted bitumen in British Columbia's coastal areas.The pipeline received its federal approval during the rule of the incumbent Liberal party, which failed to secure majority against the Alliance in the election held on May 9, 2017.The Canadian unit of Kinder Morgan had also raised C$1.75 billion ($1.4 billion) in May to help it fund its expansion.Per David Eby, the province’s new attorney general, there are 21 parties challenging the National Energy Board’s approval of the project in court.Thomas Berger, a former Supreme Court judge, has been appointed by the province to direct it as it seeks to become an intervenor in a judicial review of the November decision by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to back the project.The company aims to move forward with its plan in September. However, Kinder Morgan still hasn’t fulfilled five of the eight conditions required by the environmental assessment certificate issued by the previous B.C. government. Therefore, the company cannot begin construction on public lands until all the stated conditions are met.The Canadian unit of Kinder Morgan owns the 1,150 km Trans Mountain Pipeline, which carries crude and refined oil from Alberta to the west coast of British Columbia.The construction of the expansion project that could begin in September will help the company to nearly triple the size of the existing pipeline. The $7.4-billion development will help Kinder Morgan to carry 890,000 barrels a day of crude from Edmonton, Alberta to Barnaby, British Columbia.Over the last three months, shares of Kinder Morgan have lost 4.1% compared with the industry’s decline of 3.0%.Kinder Morgan currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The dividend is payable on Aug 15 to shareholders on record as of Jul31.Segment AnalysisNatural Gas Pipelines: Operating income from this segment was $907 million, down 6.2% from $967 million in the year-ago comparable quarter. The downside was due to divestment of 50% interest in its SNG during the third quarter of 2016along with lower volumes that impacted most of its midstream gathering and processing assets. Further, an adverse impact on the tariff rates of Colorado Interstate Gas Company pipeline following the rate case settlement in2016 contributed to lower income.The negatives were partially offset by improved contributions from Tennessee Gas Pipeline (TGP) owing to incremental short-term capacity sales and projects commissioned. Higher results from the Elba Express pipeline and better performances by the Texas Intrastate pipelines are favorable factors as well.CO2: The segment reported earnings of $221 million, which increased 8% from $204 million in second-quarter 2016. Higher volumes owing to considerable demand from third parties supported the improvement. However, the upside was partially limited by lower commodity prices.Terminals: This business unit reported profit of $304 million, which improved 1%from $302 million in the April–June quarter of 2016, mainly due to significant contributions from the liquid terminals.Products Pipelines: This segment recorded earnings of $324 million, up 11% year over year. Higher refined products volumes were responsible for the improvement and were partially offset by higher expenses.Kinder Morgan Canada: The segment reported earnings of $43 million, which decreased 7% from $46 million in second-quarter 2016. Lower income was attributable to higher expenses and a 21% decrease in volumes to Washington state, owing to a shift in deliveries from Washington to British Columbia destinations.Operational HighlightsTotal expenses in the quarter were $2,446 million, up 11% from $2,204 million spent in the second quarter of 2016.Operating income of $922 million went down nearly 2% from $940 million in the year-ago quarter.Second-quarter net income of $337 million increased from $333 million in the comparable quarter in 2016.  Kinder Morgan, Inc.

277,KMI,"Kinder Morgan, Inc.’s (KMI  -  Free Report) subsidiary, Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company LLC, has filed an application with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to boost flow of natural gas to Mexico.The company plans to boost capacity along one of its existing cross-border natural gas pipelines in the Rio Grande Valley. Kinder Morgan intends to enhance capacity of its Pemex Border Crossing Facility between Hidalgo, Texas, and Reynosa, Mexico. Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company wants FERC to approve capacity expansion on this pipeline to 468 million cubic feet per day from nearly 185 million cubic feet per day.Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company has also appealed for the acceleration of the process. The boosting of the capacity along the 24-inch pipeline will not entail any construction activity or physical alterations. Moreover, Mexico is listed by the United States as a ""free trade nation"" under the North American Free Trade Agreement.In March 1999, the cross-border project was originally approved by the FERC officials. Kinder Morgan acquired Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company in August 2012. The company stated in its application that an environmental appraisal is not essential because one had already been executed for the project when it was initially approved. Further, the expansion will not entail any new construction.Per a notice released by the FERC Secretary under the federal law, the agency has 90 days to either file its own environmental appraisal of the project or open a schedule to perform an review, which will entail numerous state and federal agencies.A 20-day public comment period has been opened by FERC secretary for the company’s application and will close on January 24.Price PerformanceKinder Morgan’s shares have lost 1.6% against the industry’s gain of 2.1% in the last six months.Zacks Rank & Key PicksKinder Morgan currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

278,KMI,"TransCanada Corporation (TRP  -  Free Report) recently obtained 20-year commitments from various oil companies to ship around 500,000 barrels a day through its Keystone XL pipeline. The commercial commitment amounts to around 60% of the total capacity of 830,000 barrels a day, reflecting gradual increasing customer support for the pipeline.The company received strong support from the Alberta government which has committed 50,000 barrels a day. The move has provided TransCanada the much-needed impetus to move forward with the project; however, the company has not made any official announcement yet. Late last year, the company declared that it needed to obtain shipments of at least 500,000 barrels for the project to be feasible. The company was to make its final decision regarding the construction and completion of the project by December 2017. However, it has not green-lit the project yet and is currently evaluating Nebraska’s decision to examine the economics of the project.Significance of the ProjectThe $8-billion Keystone XL pipeline with 830,000 barrels capacity is designed to improve oil extraction from Alberta’s oil sands and the Bakken region in the U.S. refineries. Both these areas have witnessed huge production growth over the last decade.The pipeline will ultimately reach Gulf of Mexico refineries. Western Canadian crude producers primarily use the train route to move their oil, which is costlier than movement through a pipeline. Completion of this project is expected to reduce crude shipment prices for producers and enhance their bottom line.In November 2015, President Obama turned down TransCanada's application to construct the Keystone XL pipeline on fears that it would weaken United States’ position in the international climate change negotiations. Obama had backed the argument of environmental groups that Keystone would encourage use of carbon-heavy tar sands oil, increasing global warming. However, in 2017, the project was cleared by President Trump as he was of the opinion that development of such pipelines can revive the economy.Hurdles RemainDespite Trump administration's clearance, the pipeline has been facing regulatory obstacles, and opposition from landowners, environmentalists and Native American tribes.Some environmental groups in Montana filed a lawsuit in March 2017 who claim that President Trump violated federal environmental law by approving the Keystone XL construction permit without updating the project's 5-year-old environmental impact report.Further, after TransCanada had spent months negotiating with shippers, 60% uptake — though providing some encouragement to the company — seems relatively modest as compared to Kinder Morgan's (KMI  -  Free Report) Trans Mountain Expansion Pipeline which secured shipments for 80% of its total capacity. Notably, the company cleared a major regulatory hurdle in November 2017 when Nebraska commissioners approved the project, but on an alternative route instead of the company’s proposed route. This has only created new set of problems for the company.The alternate route will likely balloon costs and delay the disputed pipeline project further.The alternate route calls for a 63-mile detour and attempts to add 5 miles of pipeline along with additional transmission lines and pumping stations. Hence the company is currently busy in reevaluating the project’s viability and schedule.It also engaged in negotiations around easements with landlords along the new route.Additionally, the Keystone project has been booked several times for causing oil spill. Federal investigators believe that constructional fault is the most likely reason for the oil spill. This has raised concerns among South Dakota regulators regarding the future operations and potential risks associated with the extension of the pipeline.While the states’ objections may cause modest delays, the risk over commercial demand and commercial viability of the project will likely be the primary factors influencing the final investment decision on the project.Despite the uncertainty and criticism that surrounds TransCanada’s major pipeline project, the company reaffirmed the forecasts of its profits and earnings growth on the Investor Day observed on Nov 28.The North American pipeline operator expects EBITDA to grow at an average annual rate of about 10% between 2015 and 2020. Further the Calgary-based company has raised the upper end of its dividend forecasts from 8% to 10%, and extended that outlook by an additional year through 2021.Zacks Rank and Key PicksTransCanada currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).TransCanada Corporation Price TransCanada Corporation Price | TransCanada Corporation QuoteFew better-ranked players in the energy space are ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report) and Royal Dutch Shell plc (RDS.A  -  Free Report).

279,KMI,"Kinder Morgan, Inc’s (KMI  -  Free Report) subsidiary — Kinder Morgan Texas Pipeline LLC (KMTP) — has inked a letter of intent for the development of the planned Permian Highway Pipeline (PHP) Project with EagleClaw Midstream Ventures, LLCand Apache Corporation (APA  -  Free Report). EagleClaw is a portfolio company of Blackstone Energy Partners.The PHP project, estimated at $2 billion, will provide a channel to transport the increased natural gas production from the Permian Basin to emerging market areas along the Texas Gulf Coast. The project is intended to transfer about 2 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d) of natural gas from the Waha area, Texas, to the U.S. Gulf Coast and Mexico markets, via a 42-inch pipeline of about 430 miles. The project is anticipated to come online by late 2020.Kinder Morgan is also appraising the economic and hydraulic viability of a 48-inch pipeline with increased transportation capacity owing to enhanced interest of producers.The PHP Project will receive natural gas supply from numerous locations, including Kinder Morgan’s, EagleClaw’s and Apache’s existing systems in the Permian Basin with additional interconnections to intrastate and interstate pipeline systems in the Waha area. The PHP Project will hold the supply on Kinder Morgan’s intrastate pipeline systems in the market area.Thereafter, the supply will be delivered to various markets, including the Katy market hub, the Agua Dulce market hub, the Coastal Bend and Kinder Morgan Tejas headers connected to the Freeport LNG export facility, the Cheniere header linked to the Cheniere Corpus Christi LNG export facility as well as several pipelines along the Texas Gulf Coast.Initially, Kinder Morgan and EagleClaw will be equal partners in the PHP Project holding 50% each. Apache, who has been jointly developing the planned project, will have the option to purchase about 33% equity in the project from the initial partners.Apache and EagleClaw will be the primary shippers on the planned pipeline, with Apache proposing to consign about 500,000 dekatherms per day. Kinder Morgan, the operator of the pipeline, will also be responsible for construction.Price PerformanceIn the past three months, Kinder Morgan’s shares have gained 13.5% compared with the industry’s 8.1% rise. Zacks Rank & Key PicksKinder Morgan currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked players in the same sector are Occidental Petroleum Corporation (OXY  -  Free Report) and China Petroleum and Chemical Corporation (SNP  -  Free Report).

280,KMI,"The trade tensions between the United States and China have hit a fever pitch. Both will now enact a 25% tariff on each other’s $34 billion worth of goods from Jul 6. The remaining $16 billion worth of goods will be under public review. But the situation may take an uglier turn as White House plans to enact tariffs on an extra $200 billion worth of Chinese goods, if China keeps retaliating.Per an article published on CNBC, the following sectors have the highest revenue exposure to China and are thus more susceptible to the trade war.Source: Thomson Reuters, Morgan Stanley Research EstimatesOn the basis of the above-mentioned chart, we dig a little deeper into these sectors amid tariff tensions.Semiconductor Per Morgan Stanley equity strategists, “semiconductor and semiconductor equipment companies have the highest revenue exposure to China at 52%” and are thus exposed to maximum risks on rising trade tensions (read: Apple's iPhone Order Cut Report May Hurt These ETFs).Chipmaker Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report) has 65% revenue exposure to China and Nvidia’s (NVDA  -  Free Report) sales exposure to China is 56%, per Goldman Sachs. Apart from these, some other tech and semiconductor companies, which have sales exposure to China in the range of 22% to 55%, include the likes of Intel (INTC  -  Free Report), Micron Technology (MU  -  Free Report) and Applied Materials AMAT. This clearly explains why the mood is somber in the semiconductor space. So, VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH  -  Free Report) may face troubles.Energy It is a two-edged sword for energy companies. First, Donald Trump’s levy of a 25% tariff on steel imports and a 10% tariff on aluminum imports from China, Canada and Mexico became a pain for U.S. oil pipeline companies. This should push up raw material prices for pipeline operators.The article published on Reuters indicated that the U.S. pipeline industry is likely to suffer cost pressure from tariffs as the industry imports about 77% of its steel requirement, according to a 2017 study on the pipeline industry (read: Is $100-a-Barrel Oil Possible? ETFs in Focus).Major U.S. energy companies including Plains All American Pipeline (PAA, Hess Corp (HES  -  Free Report) and Kinder Morgan Inc (KMI  -  Free Report) are thus on the lookout for an exemption from steel-import tariffs, per Reuters. On the other hand, China proposed “25% levies on about $1 billion a month in U.S. oil imports in retaliation for U.S. tariffs.” Energy companies have about 14% exposure to China. So, Chinese energy tariff dealt another blow to the sector.ETFs that could come under pressure are Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLE  -  Free Report) and Alerian MLP ETF (AMLP  -  Free Report).Tech Hardware & Equipment Tech companies that have extensive trade relations with China would be at high risk of falling prey to the trade war. In fact, Goldman Sachs has compiled a list of companies with considerable revenue exposure to China. These companies’ revenues are 14% exposed to China, per a CNBC article. SPDR S&P Technology Hardware ETF (XTH  -  Free Report) should thus be followed carefully.AutoBoth steel and aluminum are vital to the production of cars and trucks sold in America and would push up the sale prices of those vehicles considerably. Adding fuel to the ongoing trade tensions, the Trump administration has initiated a national security investigation into auto imports that may result in fresh tariffs (read: U.S. Auto Tariff Risk Put These ETFs and Stocks in Focus).U.S. auto companies earn about 12% revenues from China. With Beijing slamming tariffs on U.S. auto imports, First Trust NASDAQ Global Auto Index Fund (CARZ  -  Free Report) would come under pressure.Consumer ServicesAs tariff tensions heat up, inflation in the U.S. economy should perk up. Along with most market watchers, we too believe that companies will try to pass on some cost escalation to consumers. Moreover, higher inflation would give a boost to bond yields. This, in turn, might push up consumers’ borrowing costs and hurt iShares U.S. Consumer Services ETF (IYC  -  Free Report). In any case, U.S. consumer services have about 10% sales exposure to China. That is yet another risk to consumer funds.Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week. Get it free >>

281,KMI,"Matador Resources Company (MTDR  -  Free Report) recently announced that it has carried out a natural gas sales agreement with a unit of Houston, TX-based energy infrastructure company, Kinder Morgan, Inc. (KMI  -  Free Report). Moreover, Matador’s subsidiary, San Mateo Midstream, LLC that focuses on midstream operations, has finished its enhanced crude gathering system. The gathering system is located in Loving County, TX.The deal with Kinder Morgan’s unit is expected to give Matador a flow assurance, as it lifts the company’s natural gas takeaway position from its prolific Delaware Basin assets. The firm sales agreement will commence once the Gulf Coast Express Pipeline project of Kinder Morgan comes online. Per the agreement, Matador will transport 110,000-115,000 million British Thermal Units per day (MMBtu/d) of natural gas based on Houston Ship Channel pricing. Notably, the 2 billion cubic feet per day pipeline is anticipated to come online in October 2019. The deal will enable Matador’s products to reach the refineries and petrochemical facilities in the Gulf Coast.  Additionally, Matador secured natural gas takeaway deals with third-party shipping companies, enabling it to transport its Wolf and Rustler Breaks asset productions. Output from these assets marks 93% of the company’s Delaware Basin total gas production, which stood at 82.8 thousand cubic feet per day in the first quarter of 2018.   In May 2018, the expansion of San Mateo’s Loving County oil gathering system was completed, which can help the company improve its realized pricing. The expansion is also expected to help the company in lowering the risks related to operations and crude flows.  Additionally, the company witnessed an upgrade from the S&P Global Ratings for its corporate credit rating scenario, on May 22. Matador received a ‘B+’ for its corporate credit rating, upgraded from ‘B’, while its issue-level rating on senior unsecured notes was upgraded to ‘BB-‘ from ‘B’.Price PerformanceDallas, TX-based Matador has gained 12.6% in the past year compared with 13.1% growth of its industry.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderCurrently, Matador carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Investors interested in the Energy sector can opt for some better-ranked stocks in the same space like Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (APC  -  Free Report) and Delek US Holdings, Inc.

282,KMI,"Midstream energy assets operator Kinder Morgan Inc. (KMI  -  Free Report) is expected to report second-quarter 2017 earnings on Jul 19.Last quarter, the company had delivered a 5.56% negative earnings surprise. However, Kinder Morgan posted an average positive earnings surprise of 1.67% for the last four quarters. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to the announcement.Factors to ConsiderKinder Morgan has the largest network of natural gas pipelines in North America that spread over almost 70,000 miles. Most importantly, the company’s midstream properties are linked to all the prospective plays in the U.S. that are rich in natural gas.These extensive networks of natural gas pipelines, for which the company has invested billions of dollars, provide it with stable fee-based revenues. In fact, Kinder Morgan expects 91% of its 2017 cash flow generation to come from fees charged for its midstream properties.However, weaknesses in oil and gas prices could mar demand for midstream energy assets by upstream energy companies. During the April to June quarter of this year, oil and natural gas prices fell 8.4% and 5%, respectively. Lower commodity prices might call for reduced exploration and production activities. This could call for lower need for transportation and storage properties for carrying and storing the commodities produced.Price Performance in Q2During the quarter, Kinder Morgan has underperformed the Zacks categorized Oil/Gas Production Pipeline Mlp industry. Over the aforesaid period, the stock has lost 11.9% compared with the 9.6% decline of the broader industry. Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Kinder Morgan is likely to beat earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for the company is +7.14% as the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at 15 cents, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is at 14 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Kinder Morgan carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Please note that we caution investors against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or5 (Strong Sell) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderThough an earnings beat looks uncertain for Kinder Morgan, here are some firms that you may want to consider on the basis of our model. These have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Boardwalk Pipeline Partners LP (BWP  -  Free Report), with an Earnings ESP of +3.45% and a Zacks Rank #1.TransCanada Corporation (TRP  -  Free Report), with an Earnings ESP of + 7.84% and a Zacks Rank #1.The Williams Companies Inc (WMB  -  Free Report), with an Earnings ESP of + 22.22% and a Zacks Rank #2.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

283,KMI,"Energy infrastructure provider Kinder Morgan, Inc. (KMI  -  Free Report) recently announced its forecast for 2018. The company expects distributable cash flow (DCF) of $4.57 billion for the year.The company expects DCF per share to be $2.05 and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) of $7.5 billion. Both the figures are expected to be higher than the 2017 numbers based on the projects coming online in 2017 and 2018. Kinder Morgan expects to have $500 million in hand, after rewarding stockholders with planned dividend, for share repurchases and investing in high yielding projects.  In 2018, Kinder Morgan anticipates dividend per common share to rise up to 80 cents, while in 2019 and 2020 the same is expected to rise to $1.00 and $1.25, respectively. The company intends to end the year 2018 with a net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio at 5.1. Also, it has plans to invest around $2.2 billion in various expansion projects. Notably, expenses related to the Gulf Coast Express project, which is yet to be incorporated in the company's backlog, have been included in the company's 2018 budget. The company has no plans to depend on the equity markets in 2018 for discretionary spending.In December 2017, the company's $2 billion share buyback program will commence as planned. Execution of the program will result in the repurchase of 5% of outstanding shares of the company.The company generates revenues primarily through its fee-based structure, thus eliminating the effects of change in commodity prices. However, Kinder Morgan's CO2 segment possesses commodity price sensitivity where it uses the process of hedging to reduce price sensitivity. Investors should know that the company expects the price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil to be $56.50 per barrel and Henry Hub natural gas price to be $3.00 per one million British thermal units (MMBtu).   About the CompanyTX-based Kinder has the largest network of natural gas pipeline in North America that spreads over almost 70,000 miles.

As of Sep 30, 2017, total debt – both short and long-term – was $38.3 billion.

As of third-quarter 2017, total debt — both short and long term — is pegged at $37.1 billion. The debt capital is higher than the total equity capital of $36.5 billion which depicts the company’s significant exposure to debt.Price PerformanceShares of the company have lost 3.7% compared with the industry’s decline of 9.6% in the last three months. Zacks Rank & Key PicksKinder Morgan currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

285,KMI,"Energy infrastructure provider Kinder Morgan Inc (KMI  -  Free Report) reported third-quarter 2017 earnings of 15 cents per share from continuing operations, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 14 cents but decreasing 6.3% from 16 cents reported a year ago. Kinder Morgan, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Kinder Morgan, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Kinder Morgan, Inc. QuoteTotal revenue for the quarter declined 1.5% year over year to $3,281 million. However, the top line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3,242 million.Higher contribution from Elba Express pipeline supported the company’s third-quarter results. Increased contribution from the liquid terminals together with the Elba, Utopia and SNG joint ventures also contributed to the growth. It was partially offset by higher expenses and the negative impact on tariff rates of Colorado Interstate Gas Company pipeline following the rate case settlement in 2016.Investors should know that the company expects to declare an annual dividend of 80 cents per share in 2018, up 60% from the anticipated dividend in 2017. Management has predicted dividend increase during the first quarter of 2018.DividendKinder Morgan maintained its quarterly dividend of 12.5 cents a share (50 cents a share annualized). The dividend is payable on Nov 15, to shareholders on record as of Oct 31, 2017.Segment AnalysisNatural Gas Pipelines: Operating income from this segment was $928 million, down 3.2% from $959 million in the year-ago comparable quarter. The downside was due to divestment of 50% interest in its SNG during the third quarter of 2016 along with lower volumes that affected most of its midstream gathering and processing assets. Further, an adverse impact on the tariff rates of Colorado Interstate Gas Company pipeline following the rate case settlement in 2016 and disruptions caused by tropical storm Harvey contributed to lower income.The negatives were partially offset by improved contributions from Tennessee Gas Pipeline (TGP) owing to incremental short-term capacity sales and projects commissioned. Higher results from the Elba Express pipeline and better performances by the El Paso Natural Gas (EPNG) pipelines are favorable factors as well.CO2: The segment reported earnings of $217 million, which decreased 5.2% from $229 million in third-quarter 2016. Lower commodity prices along with decreased volumes were responsible for the decline.Terminals: This business unit delivered profit of $296 million, which improved 1% from $293 million in the July-September quarter of 2017, mainly due to growth in liquids operations.Products Pipelines: This segment recorded earnings of $302 million, up 3.1% year over year. Higher throughput on SFPP and Kinder Morgan Southeast Terminals were responsible for the improvement.Kinder Morgan Canada: The segment reported earnings of $50 million, which decreased 4.2% from $48 million in third-quarter 2016. Lower income was attributable to higher expenses and decrease in volumes to Washington, owing to a shift in deliveries from Washington to British Columbia destinations.Operational HighlightsOperating expenses in the quarter were $2,451 million, down 0.1% from $2,448 million in the third quarter of 2016.   Operating income amounted $830 million, down 5.9% from the comparable quarter a year ago. Operating margin was approximately 25.3% compared with 26.5% in the year-ago quarter. FinancialsThe company reported third-quarter distributable cash flow of $774 million compared with $1,081 million in the prior-year quarter. The company had a project backlog of $12 billion at the end of the quarter compared with $12.2 billion at the end of prior-year quarter.As of Sep 30, 2017, Kinder Morgan reported $539 million in cash and cash equivalents. The company’s long-term debt amounted to $33,969 million at the quarter end. Total debt-to-capitalization ratio at the end of third-quarter 2017 was 48%.Q3 Price PerformanceDuring the quarter under review, Kinder Morgan’s shares have returned 0.1% compared with the industry’s increase of 1.9%.OutlookKinder Morgan reaffirmed its dividend guidance. The company is likely to pay dividends of 50 cents per share in 2017.

286,KMI,"Per sources, Kinder Morgan Inc’s (KMI  -  Free Report) Trans Mountain oil pipeline along with its expansion project is likely to be bought by Canada. The government intends to ride out the uncertainties over the construction of the pipeline. The project is owned by the company’s subsidiary — Kinder Morgan Canada Ltd.No details were disclosed by the respective parties due to the confidential nature of the discussions. An email from the company stated that it will not divulge any details unless two of its objectives were met. The first objective includes permission to undertake construction through British Columbia. The second target comprises insurance of the company’s shareholders.It is likely that Canada will buy the pipeline outright, which is currently the most feasible option. The value of the deal will be announced today during prime minister Justin Trudeau’s expected cabinet meeting.Initially, Canada offered to cover the expenses for the expansion project but is now contemplating on buying it. Post the takeover, the government intends to sell the project to complete the construction. There is no clarity on whether other Kinder Morgan assets will be included in the sale.In April, Kinder Morgan stated that it planned to defer bulk of work on its C$7.4-billion ($5.8 billion) Trans Mountain pipeline expansion and is likely to abandon the project if Canada’s provincial and federal governments cannot reach an agreement by May 31.The pipeline expansion continues to face criticism from various provincial governments of British Columbia as well as municipalities, native groups and environmental activists. This factor indicates the uncertainty over key energy projects in Canada.The shortage of pipelines and rail transportations has disrupted the production schedule of the companies in Western Canada. The companies had to slow activities due to obstruction in crude transportation. In view of this, Alberta's provincial government supports the project that has also received approval from Canada's federal government.Details related to the deal are expected to be announced by May 29, 2018.Price PerformanceKinder Morgan’s shares have lost 1.9% in the past three months, against the industry’s 1.2% growth. Zacks Rank & Key PicksKinder Morgan carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked players in the same sector are Nine Energy Service, Inc (NINE  -  Free Report), Equinor ASA (EQNR  -  Free Report) and CVR Refining, LP (CVRR  -  Free Report).

287,KMI,"It was a week where oil prices consolidated above $70-a-barrel and natural gas futures got a lift from growing cooling demand.On the news front, energy major TOTAL S.A. (TOT  -  Free Report) signed a natural gas resources development deal with the Government of Oman, while U.S. oil and gas provider Rex Energy Corp.  confirmed filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.Overall, it was another good week for the sector. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures gained about 0.8% to close at $71.28 per barrel, while natural gas prices rose some 1.5% to $2.847 per million Btu (MMBtu). (See the last ‘Oil & Gas Stock Roundup’ here: Occidental, Cheniere & Petrobras' Earnings Impress)The U.S. oil benchmark hit a new three-and-a-half-year high last week on bullish EIA inventory numbers, a looming drop in Iranian crude exports and alarming drop in Venezuelan crude output.The federal government’s EIA report revealed that crude stockpiles registered a fall of 1.4 million barrels, the second weekly decrease in a row. On a further bullish note, the report revealed that refined product inventories, gasoline and distillate, both dropped from their week earlier levels.The commodity was also supported by U.S. President Donald Trump’s recent withdrawal from a nuclear deal with OPEC’s third-largest producer Iran and a pledge to reimpose sanctions on Tehran. The action has stoked worries about an expected cut in Iranian oil exports by around 1 million barrels per day from current levels and lead to a supply shortage in an already ‘tight’ oil market.Fast falling production in Venezuela have added to the jitters. With the country tethering on the verge of an economic collapse, oil output has dwindled by almost 50% since 2005. Venezuela currently churns out less than 2 million barrels per day, much lower that its pledge per the OPEC-led supply cuts.Natural gas prices also moved northward last week. While the weekly inventory release showed a larger-than-expected increase in natural gas supplies, the report pointed to a tightening market dynamic and boosted the fuel’s price. In particular, total consumption of natural gas averaged around 57.5 Bcf per day, 4% higher on a weekly basis due to rising usage for power generation.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    TOTAL S.A. recently signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Government of Oman to develop natural gas resources in Oman. The agreement covers both the upstream and downstream businesses of the company. TOTAL’s involvement in the above project will increase its production from Oman, which was 37,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (Boe/d) in 2017.TOTAL, along with Royal Dutch Shell plc (RDS.A  -  Free Report), will develop several natural gas discoveries located in the Greater Barik area on onshore Block 6. Shell will be the operator with 75% stake and TOTAL will have 25% interest in these natural gas discoveries. Initial gas production will be 500 million cubic feet per day, with the potential to increase to 1 billion cubic feet.TOTAL has plans to utilize its equity gas entitlement from the Oman project as feedstock to develop a regional hub for Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) bunkering service to supply LNG as a fuel to marine vessels. A small-scale liquefaction plant will be built in Sohar port and TOTAL will utilize this plant to convert natural gas to LNG. In addition, TOTAL may benefit from improving natural gas demand in Oman. (Read more TOTAL Signs Agreement to Expand Operation in Oman)2.    Rex Energy Corporation, which has been facing trying times of late, recently filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Hit by the industry downturn, the Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company had been contemplating Chapter 11 filing for quite some time. Amid elevated leverage metrics, challenges in refinancing its 2020 debt maturities along with weak natural prices creating further pressure, the company is headed toward debt restructuring. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.In fact, it has reached a restructuring support deal with 100% of its first-lien lenders and 72% of second-lien bondholders. U.S. oil and gas provider, Rex Energy believes that comprehensive debt restructuring will enable it to overcome the challenging times that the company has been facing. Rex Energy has secured $100 million in financing from first-lien lenders, which along with its operating cash flow would be sufficient for the company to maintain normal operations during bankruptcy proceedings.Notably, the Appalachian Basin-focused company had got delisted from the Nasdaq stock market effective Apr 12. In its latest quarterly report, the company disclosed that it could not come into an agreement with the lenders, after it failed to make an interest payment in April. Apart from defaulting on the interest payment on its senior notes, Rex Energy also failed to supply timely financial statements and other important disclosures to its lenders.

The company is likely to use NuStar Energy L.P.’s (NS  -  Free Report) infrastructure, which includes the midstream company's Nuevo Laredo storage terminal in Mexico and its related pipelines. The terminal has five storage tanks that hold 34,000 barrels of refined products, which is likely to be increased to meet Valero's requirement. By 2018-end, Valero is expected to start shipping fuel to the storage terminal.The deal is in line with Valero's strategy of expanding its supply chain in a growing market. Notably, the company has an existing deal made in August 2017, to supply fuels in central Mexico. We note that SENER, Mexico’s Ministry of Energy, had issued renewable permits to Valero for importing almost 54 million barrels of gasoline along with more than 56.7 million barrels of diesel per annum. Notably, the latest accord comes right after the company signed a contract to foray into the South American infrastructure market through the acquisition of Pure Biofuels del Peru S.A.C.(Read more Valero Expands Into Northern Mexico Refined Product Market)4.    Apache Corporation (APA  -  Free Report) recently inked an agreement to build a new natural gas liquids (NGL) project, in a bid to advance the infrastructural development in its Alpine High play in the Permian Basin. The project, titled SCM Alpine, LLC, will be developed by Apache’s subsidiary Apache Midstream, ARM Energy Holdings LLC and its affiliate Salt Creek Midstream LLC. Notably, Salt Creek is a joint venture formed last month by Ares Management and ARM Energy to develop midstream infrastructure in the Delaware Basin.The firms intend to build a NGL header system with a takeaway capacity of 445,000 barrels per day for catering to the growing production in the Delaware sub-basin of the Permian play. The project will include two pipeline segments, originating at the Salt Creek and Apache processing facilities in Reeves County, Texas. SCM Alpine is supported by 10-year commitments from both Salt Creek and Apache, which are open to renewal twice for an additional five years. With the construction work already been commenced, the project is likely to become functional in the first quarter of 2019.The pipeline will transport NGLs to the Waha Hub, where it would interconnect with the downstream pipelines, providing access to Mont Belvieu and Corpus Christi fractionation facilities in Texas. By gaining access to the emerging Waha area, Apache’s long-term opportunities and optionality will be enhanced, providing it a competitive edge.

(KMI  -  Free Report) is going through a roller coaster ride with its Trans Mountain expansion project in Canada, where political uncertainty is playing a major role in deciding its future. Recently, the company received assurance from the Canadian government that losses related to politically-triggered delays in the project will be covered.As the future of the project seemed in jeopardy, the company started to rethink over the matter. Kinder Morgan was thinking of walking away from the project if further delays would hamper the company’s plans. The recent bottleneck in Canada’s pipelines has forced the government to take steps in this expansion project. The New Democratic Party led government of British Columbia, however, criticized the decision. The party has support from the Green Party, an environment-focused federal political party in Canada.Canadian Finance Minister, Bill Morneau stated that if Kinder Morgan leaves the Trans Mountain project, the government will be ready to provide the financial assurances as and when any company steps in to take over.

288,KMI,"Oil production is surging in Canada but producers are far from happy as their profit margin is sinking and they are striving to stay competitive with their U.S. counterparts. While upstream companies like Marathon Oil Corporation (MRO  -  Free Report), Hess Corporation (HES  -  Free Report) and others are enjoying the shale boom and rebound in prices in the United States, their Canadian counterparts like Cenovus Energy Inc. (CVE  -  Free Report) and others are thinking of reducing production. The primary reason behind this is the shortage of pipelines in the country. In short, pipeline construction in Canada has failed to keep pace with rising domestic oil production – the heavier sour variety churned out of the oil sands –  resulting in infrastructural bottlenecks. This has also forced producers to give away their products at a discounted rate.Price Differences Leading to Lower RevenuesPipeline capacity constraints mean that Canadian oil explorers are selling their products in the United States – their major market – at highly discounted prices, causing tremendous loss in revenues. In fact, the discounts have led to a huge difference between Alberta’s Western Canada Select and New York-traded West Texas Intermediate oil benchmark. After adjustments made for differences in quality and shipping costs, the Fraser Institute in Canada found the difference between oil prices in the United States and Canada at $26.30 per barrel for 2018. This is expected to land a C$15.8 billion blow to the energy sector’s revenues. Notably, the price difference between the two averaged at $16.54 per barrel during the 2012-17 period, which resulted in lost revenues of C$20.7 billion.As it is, extraction from oil sands is a high-risk strategy considering the extra costs involved compared with production from conventional oil wells. Add to it limited pipeline capacity and things do not look too promising for Canada’s upstream players.Now the question is what led to this infrastructural scenario.Environmental and Political TurmoilThough several major pipeline projects received the green light from the review agencies in the country, their future is still uncertain due to political turmoil. Moreover, environmental protests are on the rise, thereby further derailing construction. The crusaders believe that the rapidly growing movement of oil around the country is unsafe.For example, the C$7.4 billion Trans Mountain pipeline expansion project of Kinder Morgan, Inc. (KMI  -  Free Report) – a Zacks Ranks #3 (Hold) company – faced opposition from British Columbia residents and indigenous communities, who are wary of the potential impact of the project on the environment. The NDP government in British Columbia also opposed the expansion project. Currently, the Canadian government is planning to provide a financial shield to the company from the politically motivated delays.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Moreover, TransCanada Corporation’s (TRP  -  Free Report) $8 billion Keystone XL pipeline – expected to carry heavy crude from Alberta to refineries in the United States – is yet to get a final investment decision. The midstream company had secured 20 years commitment for 500 thousand barrels per day for the pipeline and received Alberta government’s support. However, the Nebraska government sanctioned the Mainline Alternative Route for the controversial project, which is longer than the company’s preferred route and has forced it to review the alternative route keeping the final decision on hold.Enbridge Inc.’s (ENB  -  Free Report) Canada-United States connecting Line 3 replacement project faced criticism from the Ojibwe communities. The capital cost of the project in Canada is estimated to be C$5.3 billion while the portion in the United States will cost $2.9 billion. The preferred route of the company goes against the interests of the Native Americans. The fate of the project is expected to be decided by Jun 27, 2018. The situation has become discouraging for investors in the oil energy space in Canada.Related ProblemsApart from Canadian oil’s massive discount relative to WTI, the pipeline shortage created another problem for the energy sector, as crude shippers increased their dependence on railway and trucks, which is costlier than pipelines as well as less safe. Carrying oil by railways and roads makes crude transportation more prone to spills, which is ironically the primary concern for environmentalists. Hence, it can be said that the pipeline shortage is causing both economic and environmental problems for Canada.Additionally, the farmers who ship their grains via railroads are experiencing difficulties as they are left with stranded cargos and cash crunch. Rise in demand for shipping crudes by rail is pushing other cargoes off the rail. It created grain backlog due to lack of lower availability of crop cars. In short, the pipeline bottleneck is slowly squeezing Canada’s two most important sectors and giving investors a hard time. It has also put the government in a tough spot.ConclusionEven if implementation of the pipeline policies accelerates, it will take considerable time to actually finish the projects. Until then, the economy is likely to take a blow on two fronts, energy and agriculture. In case of Trans Mountain, the government’s plan to provide financial assurance, taking the burden of politically-motivated delays, will further create a hole in tax payers’ fund. Hence, a sound regulatory and environmental policy framework is the need of the hour. The sooner it is devised, the better it is for the Canadian economy. Otherwise, it will become increasingly difficult for energy companies to find new routes to take the country's landlocked oil to foreign markets.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

289,KMI,"Midstream energy assets operator Kinder Morgan Inc (KMI  -  Free Report) is expected to report third-quarter 2017 earnings on Oct 18.Last quarter, the company delivered an earnings surprise of 0.00%. However, Kinder Morgan delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 1.67% for the last four quarters. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to the announcement.Kinder Morgan, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Kinder Morgan, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Kinder Morgan, Inc. Quote Which Way Are Estimates Treading?Let’s look at the estimate revisions in order to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company before earnings release.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of 14 cents for the third quarter has been stable in the last seven days. It reflects a year-over-year decline of about 12.5% from the year-ago quarter. Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $3,242 million for the impending quarter, down 2.6% from the year-ago quarter.Factors to ConsiderKinder Morgan has the largest network of natural gas pipelines in North America, spread over almost 70,000 miles. Most importantly, the company’s midstream properties are linked to all the prospective plays in the United States that are rich in natural gas.These extensive networks of natural gas pipelines, for which the company has invested billions of dollars, provide stable fee-based revenues. In fact, Kinder Morgan expects 91% of its 2017 cash flow generation to come from fees charged for midstream properties. Much these revenues would be reflected in the to-be-reported quarter.However, Kinder Morgan’s weak balance sheet is a concern. As of second-quarter 2017, total debt — both short and long term — stands at $37.1 billion. Debt capital is higher than total equity capital of $36.2 billion which depicts the company’s significant exposure to debt. If debt continues to grow, the company may face liquidity issues.Moreover, the company’s Trans Mountain pipeline expansion faces threats. Being a part of the legal dispute, the appeal, if successful, will nullify the federal sanction for the C$7.4-billion or $5.9-billion Trans Mountain project and result in extended postponement. This will be a major drawback for the company.Price Performance in Q3During the quarter, Kinder Morgan underperformed the industry. In the aforesaid period, the stock has gained 0.1% compared with the 1.9% increase of the broader industry.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Kinder Morgan is likely to beat earnings this quarter.

290,KMI,"Energy infrastructure provider Kinder Morgan (KMI  -  Free Report) has inked a letter of intent (LOI) with DCP Midstream, LP (DCP  -  Free Report) and Targa Resources (TRGP  -  Free Report).Per the LOI, all the energy players will develop the Gulf Coast Express Pipeline Project (GCX Project). The proposed pipeline is expected to serve the growing need for Permian Basin natural gas in the Texas Gulf Coast key markets. The pipeline will likely have the capacity to carry 1.92 billion cubic feet of natural gas every day.Included in the LOI, Kinder Morgan will construct and operate the pipeline project with a 50% stake. Targa Resources and DCP Midstream are each expected to have 25% ownership in the pipeline, which is likely to commence operations by the second half of 2019. The pipeline’s in-service date is primarily dependent on timely closure of shippers’ agreements. Investors should know that DCP Midstream and Targa Resources plan to transport considerable natural gas volumes through the pipeline.Overall, the pipeline project is likely to prove highly lucrative for Kinder Morgan as the development will provide the partnership with significant and sustainable fee-based revenues.Headquartered in Houston, TX, Kinder Morgan has the largest natural gas pipeline in North America that spreads over almost 70,000 miles.

292,KMI,"Midstream oil firm, Tallgrass Energy Partners, LP  recently declared an open season for its Cheyenne Connector pipeline that links Denver-Julesburg (""DJ"") Basin to Rockies Express Pipeline’s Cheyenne Hub, which is located south of the Colorado-Wyoming border.Previously, Tallgrass Energy had inked agreements with subsidiaries of Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (APC  -  Free Report) and DCP Midstream, LP (DCP  -  Free Report) to transport 600 million cubic feet of gas per day (MMcf/d) through the pipeline, which is expected to come online in the third quarter of 2019.Importance of the PipelineGas production in the DJ basin is expected to rise substantially by 2020, which will increase the demand for pipelines.Previously, Kinder Morgan, Inc.

295,KMI,"One of the largest energy infrastructure companies in North America, Kinder Morgan, Inc.’s, (KMI  -  Free Report) Trans Mountain pipeline expansion is yet again threatened.A native band in Canada has voiced objection against the company’s expansion project.The Canadian natives arenot in favor of the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion and have asked the court to mull over the federal government's point for a stricter appraisal on the project of its rival.Per Reuters, the demand was made by the west coast Nation Tsleil-Waututh in a letter to the Federal Court of Appeal. This followed closely after the announcement made by Canada’s federal agency which stated that not all sections of the society are satisfied with the government’s decision. However, the federal agency is committed to resolve the issue with the concerned parties.Being a part of the legal dispute, the appeal, if successful, will nullify the federal sanction for the C$7.4-billion or $5.9-billion Trans Mountain project and result in long postponement.The federal government gave its consent for Trans Mountain last year. Kinder Morgan countered Tsleil-Waututh's proposal in submission, on grounds that a separate opinion by Canada on Energy East was immaterial to Trans Mountain.Trans Mountain has more than two dozen parties opposing it and Tsleil-Waututh is one among them. The hearing is expected to be held in October. Province of British Columbia has also joined the fight against the project after having received the consent early this week.Financing RiskA large number of credit unions in North America havealso decided to refrain from lending funds for energy pipeline projects. The decision to stop funding such projects until September has been taken to halt the expansion of pipeline facilities which might harm the environment through accidents like oil spillage. Although this decision by credit unions is only temporary, it might be made permanent later. Meanwhile, this stance by credit unions is not in favor of Trans Mountain pipeline expansion and hence raises questions over Kinder Morgan’s prospects.Benefits of the PipelineThe construction of the expansion project that might begin in September will help the company to nearly triple the size of the existing pipeline. The $7.4-billion development will help Kinder Morgan to carry 890,000 barrels a day of crude from Edmonton, Alberta to Barnaby, British Columbia.Price MovementOver the last three months, shares of Kinder Morgan have gained 0.2% compared with the industry’s growth of 0.3%.Zacks Rank & Stock PicksCurrently, Kinder Morgan carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

QuoteIncreased contribution from the liquid terminals and the Texas Interstate System contributed to the improvement.Total revenues dropped by 0.2% year over year to $3,418 million. Moreover, the top line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3,482 million. The downside can be attributed to higher expenses and lower contributions from the CO2, Terminals and Products Pipelines segment.DividendKinder Morgan raised quarterly dividend to 20 cents per share (80 cents per share annualized) from 12.5 cents in the preceding quarter. This represents an increase of 60% and is in line with the company’s plans announced in 2017. The dividend is payable on May 15, to shareholders on record as of Apr 30.Segment AnalysisNatural Gas Pipelines: Operating income from this segment was $1,136 million, up 8% from $1,055 million in the year-ago quarter.

The growth came from various midstream gathering and processing assets, including Hiland, due to higher drilling activity.CO2: The segment reported earnings of $199 million, which fell 19% from $218 million in first-quarter 2017. Lower commodity prices were responsible for the downside.Terminals: This business unit reported profit of $295 million, which declined 4% from $307 million in the January-March quarter of 2017, mainly due to divestitures and lower contributions from existing Jones Act tankers due to lowered charter rates.Products Pipelines: This segment recorded earnings of $259 million, down 10% year over year.Kinder Morgan Canada: The segment reported earnings of $46 million, which increased 7% from $43 million in first-quarter 2017.

298,KMI,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Kinder Morgan, Inc. (KMI  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 2.6% in that time frame, underperforming the market.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Second-Quarter 2017 ResultsKinder Morgan reported second-quarter 2017 earnings of $0.14 per share from continuing operations in-line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate but decreased 6.7% from $0.15 reported a year ago.Total revenue for the quarter jumped 7.1% year over year to $3,368 million. Moreover, the top line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3,122 million.Higher contribution from Elba Express pipeline along with improved CO2 volumes supported the second quarter results. Increased contribution from the liquid terminals and successful initial public offering of its Canadian business, together with the Elba, Utopia and SNG joint ventures also contributed to the growth. It was partially offset by higher expenses and the negative impact on tariff rates of Colorado Interstate Gas Company pipeline following the rate case settlement in 2016.DividendKinder Morgan maintained its quarterly dividend at $0.125 per share ($0.50 per share annualized).Segment AnalysisNatural Gas Pipelines: Operating income from this segment was $907 million, down 6.2% from $967 million in the year-ago comparable quarter. The downside was due to divestment of 50% interest in its SNG during the third quarter of 2016along with lower volumes that impacted most of its midstream gathering and processing assets. Further, an adverse impact on the tariff rates of Colorado Interstate Gas Company pipeline following the rate case settlement in2016 contributed to lower income.The negatives were partially offset by improved contributions from Tennessee Gas Pipeline (TGP) owing to incremental short-term capacity sales and projects commissioned. Higher results from the Elba Express pipeline and better performances by the Texas Intrastate pipelines are favorable factors as well.CO2: The segment reported earnings of $221 million, which increased 8% from $204 million in second-quarter 2016. Higher volumes owing to considerable demand from third parties supported the improvement. However, the upside was partially limited by lower commodity prices.Terminals: This business unit reported profit of $304 million, which improved 1%from $302 million in the April–June quarter of 2016, mainly due to significant contributions from the liquid terminals.Products Pipelines: This segment recorded earnings of $324 million, up 11% year over year. Higher refined products volumes were responsible for the improvement and were partially offset by higher expenses.Kinder Morgan Canada: The segment reported earnings of $43 million, which decreased 7% from $46 million in second-quarter 2016. Lower income was attributable to higher expenses and a 21% decrease in volumes to Washington state, owing to a shift in deliveries from Washington to British Columbia destinations.Operational HighlightsTotal expenses in the quarter were $2,446 million, up 11% from $2,204 million spent in the second quarter of 2016.Operating income of $922 million went down nearly 2% from $940 million in the year-ago quarter.Second-quarter net income of $337 million increased from $333 million in the comparable quarter in 2016.FinancialsThe company reported second-quarter distributable cash flow of $1,022 million compared with $1,050 million in the prior-year quarter. The company had a project backlog of $12.2 billion at the end of the quarter as against $11.7 billion at the end of prior year quarter.As of Jun 30, Kinder Morgan had cash and cash equivalents of $452 million. The company’s long-term debt amounted to $33,900 million at the end of the quarter. Total debt-to-capitalization ratio at the end of second-quarter 2017 was 48.4%.OutlookKinder Morgan reaffirmed its dividend guidance. The company is likely to pay dividends of $0.50 per share in 2017. For 2018, Kinder Morgan projects a yearly dividend of $0.80 per share, reflecting a 60% rise from the projected dividend level for 2017. On top of that, for 2019 and 2020, the company projects a 25% increase in dividend.   It continues to expect EBITDA and distributable cash flow of about $7.2 billion and $4.46 billion, respectively.For 2017, Kinder Morgan anticipates the capital expenditure projection at about $3.2 billion for growth projects.

Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Second-Quarter 2017 ResultsKinder Morgan reported second-quarter 2017 earnings of $0.14 per share from continuing operations in-line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate but decreased 6.7% from $0.15 reported a year ago.Total revenue for the quarter jumped 7.1% year over year to $3,368 million. Moreover, the top line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3,122 million.Higher contribution from Elba Express pipeline along with improved CO2 volumes supported the second quarter results. Increased contribution from the liquid terminals and successful initial public offering of its Canadian business, together with the Elba, Utopia and SNG joint ventures also contributed to the growth. It was partially offset by higher expenses and the negative impact on tariff rates of Colorado Interstate Gas Company pipeline following the rate case settlement in 2016.DividendKinder Morgan maintained its quarterly dividend at $0.125 per share ($0.50 per share annualized).Segment AnalysisNatural Gas Pipelines: Operating income from this segment was $907 million, down 6.2% from $967 million in the year-ago comparable quarter. The downside was due to divestment of 50% interest in its SNG during the third quarter of 2016along with lower volumes that impacted most of its midstream gathering and processing assets. Further, an adverse impact on the tariff rates of Colorado Interstate Gas Company pipeline following the rate case settlement in2016 contributed to lower income.The negatives were partially offset by improved contributions from Tennessee Gas Pipeline (TGP) owing to incremental short-term capacity sales and projects commissioned. Higher results from the Elba Express pipeline and better performances by the Texas Intrastate pipelines are favorable factors as well.CO2: The segment reported earnings of $221 million, which increased 8% from $204 million in second-quarter 2016. Higher volumes owing to considerable demand from third parties supported the improvement. However, the upside was partially limited by lower commodity prices.Terminals: This business unit reported profit of $304 million, which improved 1%from $302 million in the April–June quarter of 2016, mainly due to significant contributions from the liquid terminals.Products Pipelines: This segment recorded earnings of $324 million, up 11% year over year. Higher refined products volumes were responsible for the improvement and were partially offset by higher expenses.Kinder Morgan Canada: The segment reported earnings of $43 million, which decreased 7% from $46 million in second-quarter 2016. Lower income was attributable to higher expenses and a 21% decrease in volumes to Washington state, owing to a shift in deliveries from Washington to British Columbia destinations.Operational HighlightsTotal expenses in the quarter were $2,446 million, up 11% from $2,204 million spent in the second quarter of 2016.Operating income of $922 million went down nearly 2% from $940 million in the year-ago quarter.Second-quarter net income of $337 million increased from $333 million in the comparable quarter in 2016.FinancialsThe company reported second-quarter distributable cash flow of $1,022 million compared with $1,050 million in the prior-year quarter. The company had a project backlog of $12.2 billion at the end of the quarter as against $11.7 billion at the end of prior year quarter.As of Jun 30, Kinder Morgan had cash and cash equivalents of $452 million. The company’s long-term debt amounted to $33,900 million at the end of the quarter. Total debt-to-capitalization ratio at the end of second-quarter 2017 was 48.4%.OutlookKinder Morgan reaffirmed its dividend guidance. The company is likely to pay dividends of $0.50 per share in 2017. For 2018, Kinder Morgan projects a yearly dividend of $0.80 per share, reflecting a 60% rise from the projected dividend level for 2017. On top of that, for 2019 and 2020, the company projects a 25% increase in dividend.   It continues to expect EBITDA and distributable cash flow of about $7.2 billion and $4.46 billion, respectively.For 2017, Kinder Morgan anticipates the capital expenditure projection at about $3.2 billion for growth projects. The company will likely finance the investment through cash flow that are generated internally.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?

300,KMI,"Kinder Morgan Inc (KMI  -  Free Report) is expected to post first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 18.Last quarter, the company delivered an earnings surprise of 16.7%. Moreover, Kinder Morgan delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 4.6% in the last four quarters. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to the announcement.Which Way are Estimates Treading?Let’s look at the estimate revisions to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company before earnings release.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of 21 cents for the first quarter has been stable in the last 30 days. It reflects improvement of about 23.5% from the year-ago quarter.Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $3,482 million for the impending quarter, showing an increase of 1.7% from the prior-year quarter.Factors to ConsiderKinder Morgan has the largest network of natural gas pipelines in North America, spread over almost 70,000 miles. Notably, the company’s midstream properties are linked to all the prospective plays in the United States, rich in natural gas.These extensive networks of natural gas pipelines, for which the company has invested billions of dollars, provide stable fee-based revenues. In fact, Kinder Morgan expects 85% of its cash flow generation to come from fees charged for midstream properties over the coming quarters. The revenues from midstream properties will be reflected in the quarterly results.However, Kinder Morgan’s weak balance sheet is a concern. As of fourth-quarter 2017, total debt — short and long term — is pegged at $34 billion. Debt capitalization ratio of 49.9% is higher than the industry’s ratio of 48.2%, which depicts the company’s significant exposure to debt. The company may face liquidity issues, if its debt continues to increase.Moreover, the company’s Trans Mountain pipeline is plagued by uncertainties. The company has deferred bulk of work on its $5.8 billion Trans Mountain pipeline expansion and is likely to abandon the project if Canada’s provincial and federal governments cannot reach an agreement by May 31. After this announcement, Alberta offered financial assistance. However, nothing is certain. If the pipeline is not constructed, this will be a major drawback for the company and it will adversely impact earnings in the first-quarter.Price Performance in Q1During the quarter, Kinder Morgan has underperformed the industry. In the aforesaid period, the stock has lost 16.6% compared with the industry’s decline of 14.9%. Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Kinder Morgan will beat earnings this quarter.

301,KMI,"Kinder Morgan Canada Limited, an indirect subsidiary of Kinder Morgan, Inc. (KMI  -  Free Report), will likely get financial assistance from Alberta for the struggling Trans Mountain expansion project, per Reuters.The responses from Alberta came after Kinder Morgan recently announced that there are chances that the expansion project will be dumped if the legal battles are not settled by May 31.The federal government of Canada continues to lend full support for the expansion. This convinced Premier Rachel Notley to take into account several financial alternatives to support the expansion development. Reuters added that Alberta might also consider outright purchase of the pipeline if the situation arises.However, it is not clear whether Alberta government will utilize public funds for financing both the expansion development and the existing businesses of the Trans Mountain pipeline, Reuters claimed.Investors should know that the Trans Mountain pipeline is involved in carrying liquids to Vancouver, British Columbia from Alberta at a rate of 300,000 barrels per day (bpd). The highly demanded C$7.4 billion expansion plan of the pipeline was permitted by the Canadian government on late 2016. The expansion will likely boost the pipeline’s transportation capacity to as high as 890,000 bpd.Headquartered in Houston, TX, Kinder Morgan is among the leading North American energy infrastructure players.However, the stock has lost 27.9% over the past year, underperforming the industry’s 18.4% decline.Presently, the firm carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Meanwhile, better-ranked players in the energy space include Antero Resources Corp. (AR  -  Free Report), Continental Resources, Inc. (CLR  -  Free Report) and Northern Oil and Gas, Inc. (NOG  -  Free Report). All the stocks sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

302,KMI,"It was a week where both oil and natural gas finished lower.On the news front, supermajor Royal Dutch Shell plc (RDS.A  -  Free Report) and upstream player SM Energy Company (SM  -  Free Report) struck separate divestment deals, while energy infrastructure provider Kinder Morgan Inc. (KMI  -  Free Report) said that it is halting most activities and associated spending on the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion project.Overall, it was a dismal week for the sector. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures lost around 4.4% to close at $62.06 per barrel, while natural gas prices fell 1.2% to $2.701 per million Btu (MMBtu). (See the last ‘Oil & Gas Stock Roundup’ here: Concho Strengthens Permian Hold, Tallgrass to Buy MLP)The U.S. oil benchmark closed in the red last week on escalating trade tensions with China and uptick in the rig count.Announcements of duties and counter duties by Washington and Beijing on a wide range of imports have led to apprehensions of a full-blown trade battle between the world’s two biggest economies. Market participants fear that the dispute could potentially hamper global growth and harm oil demand.A rise in the oil drilling rig count – pointing to a increase in domestic output – also played spoilsport. An early gauge of future activity, rigs drilling for oil in America totaled 808 in the week to Apr 6, as per the latest weekly report by Baker Hughes, a GE Company. That's much higher than the year-ago tally of 672, indicating a drilling resurgence – a big concern for oil investors.Natural gas prices also moved southward last week despite a larger-than-expected decrease in supplies. The fall was triggered by a mild weather outlook (translating into tepid demand for the fuel) amid strong production. As it is, investors are expecting near-term consumption to dip following the end of the winter heating season.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    Royal Dutch Shell recently divested its entire stake in Oman’s Mukhaizna oilfield to India’s largest oil company, Indian Oil Corporation. The European oil giant sold its entire 17% interest in the oil field to IOCL Singapore PTE Ltd — a wholly-owned subsidiary of Indian Oil — for a total consideration of $329 million.Mukhaizna oilfield, being the largest oilfield in Oman, accounts for 13% of the total oil production of 120,000 barrels per day in the nation. The deal marks the first upstream acquisition of Indian Oil in Oman that is likely to enhance its global footprint and growth opportunities in the Middle East region, along with bolstering India’s energy security.The move will help Shell proceed with its $30 billion divestment program. The deal provides the company with a major uplift in its drive to decrease debt, following the acquisition of BG Group for $47 billion. The divestment is expected to reduce the company’s cost and enhance cash flow, as well as return to capital. The deal will also help the company to upgrade and streamline its upstream portfolio.

The company did not reveal the buyers. A cumulative amount of $292.3 million is expected from the transactions. The transactions are expected to close in the second quarter of 2018, with effective date of Jan 1, 2018.The first agreement relates to the sale of remaining assets in the Williston Basin located in Divide County, ND. This comprises net acreage of about 119,400, which are primarily contiguous. It also includes net proved reserves as of year-end 2017 of 28.8 million barrels of oil equivalent (MMBoe), of which 52% are proved undeveloped. In December 2017, net production from the assets to be sold was about 6,100 Boe per day, of which 83% was oil.The second transaction is for the sale of its third-party operated assets known as Halff East located in Upton County, TX. The assets likely to be sold in Upton County comprises a 60% working interest in third-party operated assets, a net acreage of about 5,400 and 1.6 MMBoe net proved reserves as of year-end 2017, of which 0% is proved undeveloped. In December, net production from these assets was about 1,025 Boe per day, of which 72% oil.

The Government of Canada approved the Trans Mountain expansion project on Nov 29, 2016. Since then, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company is struggling with approval issues and oppositions from various groups. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The pipeline expansion has been facing antagonism from various provincial governments of British Columbia as well as municipalities, native groups and environmental activists. These emphasize the uncertainty over the key energy projects in Canada.The shortage of pipelines and rail transportations has disrupted the production schedule of the companies in Western Canada. The companies had to slow their activities due to obstruction in crude transportation. In view of this, Alberta's provincial government supports the project that has also received approval from Canada's federal government.

(CRZO  -  Free Report) to put pressure on the company, for pursuing asset sales and other strategic initiatives to buoy its staggering financials and share price. Activist Investor Kimmeridge increased its stake in Carrizo to 8.1%, reflecting a 65% jump from the previously held 4.9%. Post the development, shares of Carrizo have moved up 11.5%.Carrizo is burdened with a heavy debt pile of around $1.63 billion, which is even higher than the company’s market capitalization. Notably, the company’s debt levels witnessed a year-over-year increase of 22.5% in 2017. Carrizo currently carries a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 81.5% that limits its growth and restricts financial flexibility. The low liquidity of the company, which stands at 0.33, also raises concern over its asset-management practices, considering it as a small-cap company.  Kimmeridge wants the company to divest its assets in the Eagle Ford Shale to delever its balance sheet. The private equity company either wants Carrizo to exit entirely from its Eagle Ford Holdings for debt reduction or if not all, then part of its holdings to use the proceeds for share buyback purposes.

Per the restructuring agreement, the international offshore drilling company will witness capital injection of $1.08 billion that would comprise $880 million of secured loans and $200 million equity.SeaDrill’s restructuring plan will now have to be approved on a confirmation hearing scheduled to commence on Apr 17, 2018. Following the approval of the plan, existing shareholders will receive 1.9% stake in the post-restructuring equity.Being one of the worst sufferers of the downturn and burdened with massive debt, the company had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Sep 12 to restructure its balance sheet amid volatile oil prices.Price PerformanceThe following table shows the price movement of some the major oil and gas players over the past week and during the last 6 months.CompanyLast Week Last 6 MonthsXOM+0.3%-9%CVX+0.6%-2.4%COP-0.1%+23.2%OXY+4%+6.9%SLB-0.6%-5.1%RIG-1.8%-5.9%VLO+2.6%+24.1%ANDV+6.3%+0.2%Despite the bearish oil market sentiment, the Energy Select Sector SPDR – a popular way to track energy companies – remained essentially unchanged last week.

303,KMI,"Kinder Morgan Inc (KMI  -  Free Report) states that it has deferred bulk of work on its C$7.4-billion ($5.8 billion) Trans Mountain pipeline expansion and is likely to abandon the project if Canada’s provincial and federal governments cannot reach an agreement by May 31.Per Kinder Morgan Chairman Steve Kean, the plans to nearly triple the capacity of the Trans Mountain pipeline, which carries crude from Alberta's oil sands to a facility in the Pacific province of British Columbia, are likely to be scrapped if the ongoing legal disputes are not resolved by May 31.

These emphasize the uncertainty over the key energy projects in Canada.The shortage of pipelines and rail transportations has disrupted the production schedule of the companies in Western Canada. The companies had to slow their activities due to obstruction in crude transportation. In view of this, Alberta's provincial government supports the project that has also received approval from Canada's federal government.While the federal government has the authority to approve major pipelines, the 10 provinces have extensive responsibility for resource development. This is likely to lead to an impasse, if a province contests a decision made by Ottawa.Canada is considered to hold the world's third largest proven reserves of crude and is the largest exporter of energy to the United States. About 97% of Canada’s proven oil reserves are located in the oil sands and 99% of the total extracts are exported to the United States.Canada is expected to continue pumping from the oil sands over the next few years. However, constraints like pipeline approvals and ambiguity over the provision of export capacity is discouraging for the next phase of development. These hurdles are part of a wider capacity crisis developing in North America. Kinder Morgan is very cautious in handling shareholder money. With that in mind, the company doesn’t want to risk the shareholders’ fund on the project as it is tangled in many legal cases.Currently, Kinder Morgan is performing preliminary work and has not commenced construction. The company’s decision will further raise alarm in the energy industry about whether any new pipelines can be built in Canada.There are other pipelines that are facing legal hurdles. Enbridge Inc.’s (ENB  -  Free Report) Line 3 replacement, starting from Hardisty, Alberta to Superior, Wisconsin, is expected to provide Canadian takeaway capacity over the next few years. However, the project is still awaiting approval from Minnesota. When operational, the pipeline will augment takeaway capacity by 125,000 bpd.Even TransCanada Corp.’s (TRP  -  Free Report) Alberta-to-Nebraska Keystone XL pipeline is facing considerable objection.Price PerformanceKinder Morgan’s shares have lost 19.7% in the last three months, compared with the industry’s 16.7% decline. Zacks Rank & Key PicksKinder Morgan carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Another better-ranked player in the same sector is Continental Resources, Inc (CLR  -  Free Report), which sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

304,KMI,"The shortage of pipelines and rail transportations has disrupted the production schedule of the companies in Western Canada. The companies had to slow down their activity levels due to difficulty in crude transportation.Oil sands companies such as Cenovus Energy Inc. (CVE  -  Free Report), Suncor Energy Inc. (SU  -  Free Report) and Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. (CNQ  -  Free Report) witnessed a decline in share prices after Cenovus Energy announced a cut in its production at Christina Lake and Foster Creek complexes. Cenovus Energy and Suncor Energy hold a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Per Cenovus Energy, Christina Lake and Foster Creek complexes have been operating at reduced levels since February 2018.  Factors Causing Transportation IssuesThe new supply, which has arrived in the market from the start up of new oil sands, is facing transportation issues as Keystone pipeline lowered shipments in November 2017, thanks to a spill. This has pushed the heavy Canadian crude prices to trade close to the largest discount to U.S. benchmark oil futures in more than four years. Other existing pipelines are fully committed, while exporters shipping crude using rail have faced hindrances amid excess grain that is to be transported.The heavy discount between Canadian crude prices and futures has forced the oil sands players to shut their plants this month for maintenance. For instance, Canadian Natural Resources’ Peace River oil sands site is currently under maintenance. Moreover, it has also reduced its pace of the ramp up and completion of some wells.Per industry researcher Genscape Inc., Western Canadian crude production was more than the pipeline capacity to transfer it to markets by 87,000 barrels per day (bpd) in December 2017. This is expected to grow to 338,000 bpd by the end of 2018.How are Companies Coping?Cenovus Energy has maintained its full-year oil sands production within the earlier projection of 364,000-382,000 bpd. But the company anticipates first-quarter output in the range of 350,000-360,000 bpd.The companies are trying to reduce the impact of pipeline and rail constraints by scheduling the maintenance accordingly. They are also in talks with rail providers to work out the issue of lack of locomotive hauling capacity disturbing its Bruderheim crude-by-rail facility near Edmonton.Toward the end of the year, more volumes are expected to move by rail. Rail companies are eager to help but they need to work out the availability of power and the locomotives needed for this purpose. This will give the much-needed relief as about 900,000 bpd can be exported by rail.New Pipelines Facing Legal IssuesEnbridge Inc.’s (ENB  -  Free Report) Line 3 replacement spanning across Hardisty, Alberta and Superior, Wisconsin, is expected to provide Canadian takeaway capacity over the next few years. However, the project is still awaiting approval from Minnesota. When operational, the pipeline will augment takeaway capacity by 125,000 bpd.Kinder Morgan Inc.’s (KMI  -  Free Report) Trans Mountain pipeline has also been facing considerable objection and even TransCanada Corp.’s (TRP  -  Free Report) Alberta-to-Nebraska Keystone XL pipeline. The International Energy Agency (IEA) anticipates the pipelines not to be ready prior to 2021.Oil Production in CanadaCanada is the fourth-largest producer and third-largest exporter of oil, globally. About 97% of Canada’s proven oil reserves are located in the oil sands and 99% of the total extracts are exported to the United States.Canada is expected to continue pumping out more oil from the oil sands over the next few years. However, constraints like pipeline approvals and ambiguity over the provision of more export capacity is discouraging the next wave of development. These obstacles are part of a wider capacity crisis developing in North America.Regardless of the lack of pipelines, Canada is likely to be among the countries with highest oil output over the next few years. The country’s overall production will reach 5.6 million bpd by 2023, versus 4.8 million bpd this year.Bottom LineThe call of the moment is to expedite the process of approving the pipelines under scanner. If this does not happen or the process is delayed, the increased supply coming out of oil sands in the coming years will face shortages in midstream capacity. Also, the Canadian heavy oil benchmark — Western Canada Select — will trade at high discount.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

305,KMI,"Kinder Morgan, Inc.’s (KMI  -  Free Report) fourth-quarter 2017 earnings are likely to face the brunt of U.S. tax reforms.Kinder Morgan is expected to face a one-time charge of $1.4 billion against earnings, as lower tax rates will affect the value of deferred tax assets. Per the company, the charge was a preliminary estimate and will be applied against fourth-quarter 2017 earnings.However, the company forecasts the scenario to improve over a period of 10 years. Kinder Morgan continues to develop its ability to fully expense capital spending on certain assets. Additionally, lower corporate tax rate bodes well for the company.In January 2018, BP announced that it will receive a one-off non-cash charge of about $1.5 billion in fourth-quarter 2017 results, following the U.S. Corporate Tax reform.Since the energy industry is capital intensive, the new changes in corporate taxes are beneficial. The companies will be able to deduct capital expenditures from taxable income, immediately, per the provisions of the tax reform bill. Currently, capital expenditures cannot be deducted from the tax in the year they are incurred. Consequently, the domestic companies need to plan expenditures, strategically.In 2018, the companies’ tax bills will be lowered due to higher deductions. The companies will have more cash in hand to fund capital expenditures, acquisitions and share repurchases. Hence, we can expect higher spending by oil majors.Some oil majors with huge capital spending like ExxonMobil Corp (XOM  -  Free Report), Chevron Corporation (CVX  -  Free Report) and Royal Dutch Shell plc (RDS.A  -  Free Report) are likely to gain from these changes.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.
