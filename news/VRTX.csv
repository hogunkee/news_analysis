It will test drugs known as VX-445, tezacaftor and ivacaftor in two groups of patients with specific genetic mutations associated with their cystic fibrosis.If successful, Vertex could use four weeks of effectiveness data and 12 weeks of safety data to seek approval in the first group of patients. Vertex could seek approval in the second group after four weeks of effectiveness data and 24 weeks of safety data.The firm also announced data from studies of drugs called VX-561 and tezacaftor with either VX-659 or VX-445. Patients showed an average improved ability to forcefully expel air of 12.2 and 11.7 percentage points from baseline for the VX-659 and VX-445 regimens, respectively.The triple-pill regimens were given to patients daily and the majority of adverse events were mild or moderate in severity. But after discussion with the Food and Drug Administration, Vertex said it plans to run further studies of VX-561 to determine the proper dose.""We do not believe this is a material concern as a (once daily pill) is a 'nice to have' but far from a 'must have' for the first triples,"" RBC analyst Brian Abrahams said in a note to clients.

5,VRTX,"Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) shares rocketed to a three-month high Friday after rival Galapagos (GLPG) released disappointing results for a cystic fibrosis treatment that led partner AbbVie (ABBV) to opt out of additional studies.On the stock market today, Vertex popped 15.2%, to 169.96. Shares of Galapagos tumbled 3.8%, to 92.18, though AbbVie stock lifted 0.3%, to 92.69.

The patients had already received Vertex's drug, Orkambi. But Galapagos' goal of showing its drug could be part of a triple-regimen in cystic fibrosis fell short.At day 28, patients treated with GLPG2737 showed a 3.4% improvement in lung function over those who received the placebo. That failed to hit statistical significance. It also trailed Vertex's data for its drugs VX-659 and VX-445, which showed benefits of 10%-11% and 12%-14%, respectively.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

7,VRTX,"Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) is getting some breathing room, an analyst said Thursday, as rival Proteostasis (PTI) tumbled on disappointing results from a study testing cystic fibrosis drugs.Proteostasis tested its drug, PTI-801, in patients also taking Vertex's drug Orkambi. The regimen showed improvements in blood glucose, sweat chloride — an indicator of cystic fibrosis — and weight gain. But patients didn't experience a major improvement in their breathing.It's ""not as easy as it looks,"" Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges said in a note. Vertex shares have dipped 10% quarter to date on competitive worries. But the ""sell-off can reverse after competitive threats fade,"" he said.Vertex rose as much as 2.5% intraday, but ended the regular session down a fraction to 145.75. Shares of Proteostasis crashed 38% to 3.03 on the stock market today. Galapagos (GLPG), another rival, saw its shares lose 2.5% to 102.67 on Proteostasis' news.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseA number of cystic fibrosis drugs work to correct malfunctioning protein made by the CFTR gene. PTI-801 is what's known as a CFTR corrector. Vertex has a portfolio of correctors that work in different patients based on their own genetic mutations.Vertex, Proteostasis and Galapagos with partner AbbVie (ABBV) are all working on combinations of drugs to treat cystic fibrosis. The study from Proteostasis was looking to determine the best doses of PTI-801 for double- and triple-pill studies, Leerink analyst Joseph Schwartz said.The key metric these tests look to improve is forced expiratory volume for one second. In Proteostasis' study, the best result came from a 200-milligram dose of PTI-801 on top of Orkambi. That improved forced expiratory volume for one second by 2.5 percentage points.But that lagged Vertex's newly approved drug Symdeko — a two-medicine regimen — which improves patients' ability to forcefully expel air by 10% to 11%, Leerink's Porges said. Now, Proteostasis' competitive threat ""appears modest,"" he said""While Proteostasis' corrector binds to a different site on the CFTR protein than Vertex's medicines, the failure to match the high (effectiveness) bar established by Vertex is a testament to the difficult development path for competitors with small molecule therapies for cystic fibrosis,"" he said.Galapagos will likely have data later this month for a study of its second-generation corrector on top of Orkambi.The results from Proteostasis ""suggest that the medicinal chemistry at Vertex may indeed be a durable competitive advantage for the company in the cystic fibrosis indication,"" he said. But if Galapagos is successful, Vertex could ""retrace back to the 160-170 range through June and July.""RELATED:Chart-Reading Basics: How A Buy Point Marks A Time Of Real OpportunityHow To Tame A Volatile Swing Trade With A Half PositionLooking For The Next Nvidia?

8,VRTX,"Acceleron Pharma (XLRN) stock jumped Tuesday after it and Celgene (CELG) reported a second win in as many weeks for their blood-disease drug called luspatercept.By the closing bell on the stock market today, Acceleron shares rose 2.9%, to 48.76, after earlier popping as much as 5.4%. Celgene advanced 0.9%, to 84.56. Shares of biotech companies broadly dipped less than 1%.Luspatercept could stoke more confidence in Celgene, RBC Capital Markets analyst Brian Abrahams said. The firm's biggest cancer drug, Revlimid, will soon face a patent cliff. But Celgene is working other angles in cancer drugs. It acquired Juno Therapeutics and is partnered with Bluebird Bio (BLUE).""We view this as another positive development that, after recent successes with (Juno's drug called) JCAR017 and (Bluebird's drug called) bb2121, could begin to re-instill investor confidence in the pipeline beyond Revlimid not substantially reflected in shares at current levels,"" he said in a report to clients.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe study, called Believe, tested luspatercept as a treatment for patients with beta thalassemia who are dependent on regular blood transfusions. These patients don't produce enough of a protein that carries oxygen throughout the body.Luspatercept showed a ""highly statistically significant"" improvement in red blood cell response. The goal was to reduce red blood cell transfusion burden by at least 33%. Researchers also looked for an absolute reduction of at least two transfusion units from week 13 to week 24 of the study.In addition, luspatercept also met all key secondary goals of the study. Side effects were consistent with previously reported data, the biotech companies said in a news release. The firms now plan to ask regulators in the U.S. and Europe to approve the drug in the first half of 2019.The news was largely expected. About two weeks ago, Celgene and Acceleron released positive data for luspatercept in another study. That late-stage test looked at the drug's ability to improve red blood cell response in patients with what are called myelodysplastic syndromes.Analysts had varied models on these two markets for luspatercept. Credit Suisse analyst Martin Auster calls for $2 billion in peak sales for both disorders. Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges sees $2.6 billion in peak 2025 sales for both uses.RBC's Abrahams models just $1.2 billion for luspatercept — a small fraction of the $12 billion in peak sales for Revlimid. But that could still help Celgene to fill its future Revlimid-shaped hole.""We see this, coupled with other positive pipeline developments for JCAR017 and bb2121 as putting the company (Celgene) on track to reach $10 billion in probability-adjusted sales for its current pipeline,"" he said.Piper Jaffray analyst Edward Tenthoff was more bearish on partner Acceleron. He downgraded Acceleron stock to a neutral rating and cut his price target to 52 from 55.Tenthoff acknowledged the win for luspatercept but said Acceleron is ""not a buy at this valuation.""He sees sales of $20 million in 2020 after U.S. and European officials likely approve luspatercept. The biggest opportunity for the drug is in myelodysplastic syndromes where it could replace current, less effective therapies.But the tail will be short, Tenthoff said. Crispr Therapeutics (CRSP) and Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) are working on a potentially curative treatment for beta thalassemia. Their therapy could get approval by 2020, he said.""While not all patients will be appropriate for or able to afford gene therapy/CRISPR (a form of gene editing), we anticipate significant competitive pressure to impact Acceleron's market share,"" he said.RELATED:How Do You Spot A Major Market Top?

At 3:15 p.m. ET, the 30-stock blue chip index shaved some of its advance but still gained 0.8%, surpassing gains of 0.5% to 0.6% for the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq composite in stocks today.Nike (NKE) gapped up at the open and jumped more than 10% to reach all-time highs. The stock had broken out of a nine-week flat base at 70.35 on May 16. The gain has now reached 15%, so Nike shares are extended.The stock made a mild gain ahead of Friday's earnings-inspired big blast higher. Three weeks ago, the athletic apparel and shoe giant got as high as 75.91, up nearly 8%. Then the stock pulled back all the way to the 50-day moving average amid the current general market decline.Stocks that show support at the 50-day line (or 10-week moving average on a weekly chart) after a breakout from a proper base are showing signs of bullish institutional support. See the 50-day moving average as a red line in every IBD daily chart and in MarketSmith.Late Thursday, Nike reported its first quarter of double-digit EPS and revenue gains on a year-over-year basis in 14 quarters. The last time? You have to go all the way back to the second quarter of fiscal 2015, ended in November 2014, when Nike posted a 23% EPS jump on a 15% rise in sales. This time around, Nike expressed confidence in its digital e-commerce strategy and a return to growth in North America.Strong revenue or sales growth is the mother of outstanding earnings increases.

Dow Jones component UnitedHealth Group (UNH) gained 0.7% in dull turnover to 246.66. The health insurance giant looks poised to snap a four-session losing streak and stay on the north side of its 50-day moving average.UnitedHealth is up 11.8% year to date, and gains from a first-stage breakout in late February of 2016 from a saucer-style base at 121.19 have now reached 111%.United Health's earnings, up 25% to $10.07 a share in 2017, are seen rising another 25% to $12.62 a share this year and 13% in 2019.Small caps underperformed on Friday, but are still smashing the large caps in year-to-date performance. The S&P SmallCap 600 gave back modest gains to trade down nearly 0.1%. But at 1019, it still holds a solid gain of 8.9% for 2018. The S&P 500, at 2732, is up 2.2% so far this year.Meanwhile, Apple (AAPL) remained in the 5% buy zone following a second straight rally. The iPhone, iPad, and digital services giant rose 0.5% to 186.31 and is now up 4% from a breakout point of 179.04 in a well-formed double-bottom base.Apple cleared that proper entry on May 4, just days after reporting accelerating growth in both quarterly sales (up 16% to $61.14 billion) and earnings (up 30% to $2.73 a share).Please read this recent Stock Market Today column on three reasons to continue holding Apple shares despite the current downdraft in U.S. equities. Apple's Relative Price Strength Rating improved to 81 on a scale of 1 to 99, according to IBD Stock Checkup. This means that over the past 12 months, the largest company by market value in the U.S. exchanges has outperformed 81% of all companies in IBD's database.Four weeks ago, Apple's RS Rating was 76.Other leading stocks rising in heavy volume include the following:RPM International (RPM): The specialty paints and coatings firm cleared a 56.79 entry point in a five-month saucer base following news that it's going to take several initiatives to boost operating and financial performance. Activist fund Elliott Management is a key investor in the Medina, Ohio, company.Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX): The expert in treating cystic fibrosis rallied nearly 14% to 168.09 in volume running more than triple usual levels. The stock has now taken a serious step in forming the right side of a potential cuplike or saucer-style base.In a saucer, the decline from head to toe can be just as deep as a short cup base. However, they tend to stretch over many months, wearing holders out rather than shaking them out.Read this Investor's Corner on the concepts of the saucer base, one of eight important chart patterns that every growth investor can use to gain an edge on Wall Street.In other financial markets, U.S. Treasuries showed small moves. The yield on the benchmark 10-year bond edged up 1 basis point to 2.85%. Three-month T-bills yielded 1.91%, 1 basis point below 1.92% on June 1.West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures rallied 1.2% to $74.32 a barrel, hitting fresh year-to-date highs.

13,VRTX,"Analysts remained bullish Thursday after the Food and Drug Administration delayed an application from Crispr Therapeutics (CRSP) to begin gene-editing studies in sickle cell disease.Shares tumbled 6.4% to close at 68.91, though earlier fell as much as 17.1%. But Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX), which is a partner on the technology, lost 1.7% to 154. Meanwhile, shares of biotech companies broadly popped 2.1% on the stock market today.Late Wednesday, the FDA placed a clinical hold on Crispr's application to begin studies of its drug, CTX001, as a treatment for sickle cell disease. The two biotech companies noted the hold is due to ""certain questions"" from the FDA as part of its review.The clinical hold could be for a myriad reasons, Chardan analyst Gbola Amusa said in a report to clients. He noted CTX001 is the first gene-editing medicine based on technology called CRISPR to approach clinical studies.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""To us, the overall implications of this clinical hold depend on whether it is based on the gene-editing component, some other element of the CTX001 production process, the clinical trial design, and/or straightforward but needed clarifications,"" he said.If it's an issue with the CRISPR technology, it could also impact publicly traded biotech companies like Editas Medicine (EDIT) and Intellia Therapeutics (NTLA). Both are using CRISPR-based gene editing, though they're looking to use it to treat other diseases.That would also be positive for biotech companies using other modes of gene editing like Sangamo Therapeutics (SGMO), Cellectis (CLLS) and Homology Medicines (FIXX). Alternatively, the FDA might favor non-gene editing approaches from the likes of Bluebird Bio (BLUE).It's also possible the FDA is held up on a company- or disease-specific issue. If that's the case, it could impact other programs from Crispr. Crispr is also working on a cancer drug called CTX101. Analysts expect it to seek FDA approval to begin studies this year.""Rapid resolution of the hold could mitigate its negative impact on the CTX001 program and the gene-editing space,"" Amusa said. ""We expect Crispr to get better visibility on the FDA's concerns in the coming one to two months.""Crispr also seeks approval in Europe to begin studies of CTX001 in another blood disease called beta thalassemia. Already, European officials cleared one application, Piper Jaffray analyst Edward Tenthoff said in his note to clients.""First-in-man CTX001 data will serve as an important driver,"" he said. It will ""set up potential rapid approval in beta thalassemia by 2020 and sickle cell disease by 2021 with blockbuster sales potential.""RELATED:Chart-Reading Basics: How A Buy Point Marks A Time Of Real OpportunityHow To Trade Stocks: Why Most Penny Stocks Fail To Make Investors RichNew Option Strategy Limits Risk Around Earnings

14,VRTX,"Dow Jones futures were little changed Thursday morning, along with S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq futures. Gene-editing specialist Crispr Therapeutics (CRSP) crashed after the FDA put a hold on its sickle cell disease treatment with Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX).Meanwhile, Amazon.com (AMZN) entered buy range Wednesday, but the trading action suggests investors may want to keep this FANG stock in the ""friend zone"" for now. Amazon's passionless move comes as Salesforce.com (CRM) had its own flawed push past a buy point, while Micron Technology (MU) failed to close above its entry for a second straight session.The Dow Jones industrial average rose 1.3% in Wednesday's stock market trading, rebounding from Tuesday's sell-off that ended with the blue-chip index just below its 50-day line. The S&P 500 advanced 1.3% as well. The Nasdaq composite rallied 0.9% to its best level in more than two months.Dow Jones futures were slightly below fair value. S&P 500 futures edged higher. Nasdaq 100 futures rose 0.2%. President Trump reportedly will implement steel tariffs vs. the European Union on Thursday. Such a move could pressure stock markets, though U.S. Steel (X) and other domestic steelmakers rallied overnight.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

Crispr is not yet active Thursday morning. Shares rose 6.8% on Wednesday. to 73.59, a new closing high.Crispr is in danger of round-tripping a breakout from a 58.96 buy point out of a cup-with-handle base.Vertex Pharmaceuticals, best known for its cystic fibrosis treatments, edged lower late. Vertex stock rose 0.9% to 156.64 Wednesday session, closing just below its 50-day line and above its 200-day average.Amazon stock rose 0.7% to 1,624.89 on Wednesday, closing above a 1,617.64 cup-base buy point for the first time. But there was no passion in the move, a relatively small percentage gain in very light volume. You want to see a stock power into a buy zone with a strong price gain and volume that's at least 40% to 50% above normal.Investors also may want to wait for Amazon to clear its April 27 record high of 1638.10, when the online sales giant spiked following its first-quarter earnings report. Actually, Amazon is well on its way to forming a short flat base, though it still needs a few more days to carve out that pattern.Amazon stock edged higher in Thursday's premarket.Salesforce stock rose 1.9% to 129.30 on Wednesday, moving back above a 128.97 flat-base buy point in robust volume following strong earnings late Tuesday. But a closer look raises some concerns. Salesforce stock closed in the lower half of its daily range after hitting 132.55 intraday. That also left Salesforce closing below the top of a brief consolidation over the past three weeks.Shares rose slightly early Thursday.Micron stock not only failed to close in buy range Wednesday, it failed to close higher. Micron cleared a 63.52 cup-base buy point for a second straight session, rising to 64.66 intraday. But the stock reversed lower to end down 0.1% at 62.57.Micron has run up 36% so far in May. That's powerful action, especially as the major averages move sideways. But that also didn't give a chance for weak holders to exit. That could be what some investors are doing now.Micron stock fell 3% early Thursday after Morgan Stanley downgraded the memory chip maker and lowered its price target.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:The Big Picture: Is This Still The Anti-Trade-War Play For Stocks?Italy's Populists Just Took Over The Fed — And The Stock Market Is OK With ThatDow Jones Stocks Apple, Microsoft, Intel, Nike, Visa Are In Buy RangeHow To Invest: Shake Shack, La Quinta Show Pattern Seen In IPOsLululemon, Ulta Beauty, Workday Earnings On Tap: Investing Action Plan

15,VRTX,"Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) had its Relative Strength (RS) Rating upgraded from 88 to 91 Monday. X IBD's proprietary rating identifies price action with a 1 (worst) to 99 (best) score. The rating shows how a stock's price performance over the trailing 52 weeks compares to all the other stocks in our database. Decades of market research reveals that the best stocks typically have an RS Rating north of 80 in the early stages of their moves.Looking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch? Start HereThe IBD Big Cap 20 stock broke out earlier, but has fallen back below the prior 167.95 entry from a consolidation. If a stock you're watching breaks past a buy point then retreats 7% or more below the original entry price, it's considered a failed base. It's best to wait for the stock to form a new base and breakout. Also keep in mind that the latest consolidation is a later-stage base, which makes it riskier to establish a new position or add shares to an existing one. Earnings growth declined last quarter from 212% to 74%. But revenue gains moved higher, from 40% to 42%. The company holds the No. 1 rank among its peers in the Medical-Biomed/Biotech industry group. Bioverativ (BIVV) and Ligand Pharmaceuticals (LGND) are also among the group's highest-rated stocks.RELATED:Biotech And Pharmaceutical Industry And Stock NewsWhich Stocks Are Showing Rising Relative Strength?Why Should You Use IBD's Relative Strength Rating?How Relative Strength Line Can Help You Judge A Stock

16,VRTX,"Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) slid to a three-week low Friday after the Food and Drug Administration called for additional tests for one compound used in a potential cystic fibrosis treatment.As a result, that potential three-drug regimen likely won't enter the market until 2022 or 2023, Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges said in a note to clients. But, he added, the FDA requirement is also a blessing for Vertex, which is rivaling Galapagos (GLPG) and AbbVie (ABBV) with these treatments.""The FDA's stance does provide some reassurance about Vertex's competitive position,"" he said. ""The FDA is clearly signaling that there are no shortcuts (at least in the U.S.) to traditional good drug development in this indication.""On the stock market today, Vertex dipped 1.7% to close at 156.05. Earlier, the stock fell as much as 3.5%. Shares are forming a flat base with a buy point at 178.35. Galapagos slipped a fraction, to 90.60.

17,VRTX,"Get premium stock lists, pass or fail stock ratings and more. Start HereVertex and Galapagos are separately working to bring three-drug regimens that treat cystic fibrosis to the market. Vertex thinks its can treat up to 90% of cystic fibrosis patients with its treatment. On Thursday, Vertex said it will send a second regimen into Phase 3 testing.But a third potential combination is being held up as Vertex does additional studies on one drug involved in the regiment, known under the test moniker of VX-561. In Phase 2 testing, a regimen of VX-561 and tezacaftor with either of two other test drugs, VX-659 or VX-445, improved patients' ability to forcefully expel air.However, ""given very little monotherapy or dose-ranging work has been done with VX-561, FDA requested additional clinical trial(s) prior to Phase 3 start,"" Needham analyst Alan Carr wrote in his report to clients. ""No guidance on timing, but a first quarter 2019 initiation seems feasible.""The once-daily regimen using VX-561 is a ""nice to have"" but far from a ""must have"" for the first three-drug regimens, RBC analyst Brian Abrahams said in a note. Two combinations in Phase 3 studies are also daily regimens, but require a single dose of Vertex's Kalydeco in the evening.Further, the delay for the VX-561 regimen doesn't mean other combinations won't pass muster with the FDA, analysts say. Vertex has a total of four potential combos in pivotal studies, Piper Jaffray analyst Edward Tenthoff said in his note. He sees Vertex as a year ahead of Galapagos.Leerink's Porges now expects Vertex's first three-drug regimens will be on the market in the first quarter of 2020. Previously, he'd predicted a late 2019 launch for these regimens.""This change is not particularly meaningful to our forecast, since Vertex's primary competitor, Galapagos, seems no closer to U.S. pivotal trials than they were six months ago,"" he said. Further, Galapagos may also be required to run additional studies before going into pivotal testing.Porges reduced his sales views for 2018 and 2019 by 4%-5%. He still sees rapid revenue growth to almost $5 billion in 2020 and $6.7 billion in 2022. He also cut his price target on Vertex to 175 from 190, though reiterated his outperform rating.""Vertex remains one of the most uncomplicated growth stories in large-cap biotech,"" he said. ""We expect it to recover from its recent weakness toward our target price in the coming months.""RELATED:Chart-Reading Basics: How A Buy Point Marks A Time Of Real OpportunityHow To Invest In Stocks For Free: New Apps Aim For BeginnersLong-Term Retirement Investing Strategies With ETFs

18,VRTX,"Last week's rally, led by the Nasdaq composite, signaled the stock market is looking healthier. But which stocks and sectors are likely to lead?The FANG+ stocks of Apple (AAPL), Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) generally have been performing well. Salesforce.com (CRM) and other software stocks have been winners. Payment stocks are a pocket of strength. Many retail names, from Lululemon (LULU) to TJX (TJX) have been strong. Energy stocks from Chevron (CVX) to Marathon Oil (MRO) are doing well, but are subject to the ups and downs of crude oil prices. Biotechs are trying to make a recovery, with Biogen (BIIB) skyrocketing Friday on positive Alzheimer's drug news.Meanwhile, chips are still well off their highs, a bad sign for any stock market rally. Financials are near 2018 lows, with JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Citigroup (C) and Wells Fargo (WFC) kicking off earnings season Friday.Dow futures rose 0.5% vs. fair value. S&P 500 futures climbed 0.5%. Nasdaq 100 futures were 0.5% above fair value. Keep in mind that Dow Jones futures and other overnight action doesn't always translate into actual trading in the next regular session.China's Shanghai composite roared 2.5% higher on Monday, after tumbling into a bear market in recent weeks. Hong Kong's Hang Seng advanced 1.3%. and Japan's Nikkei 1.2%. European markets showed modest gains intraday.During last week's holiday-shortened week, the stock market averages were volatile but ultimately rallied. The Nasdaq composite rallied 2.4%, the S&P 500 1.5% and the Dow Jones 0.8%. Friday's post-jobs, post-China tariffs rally was particularly significant. If you haven't already, you should read the latest Big Picture column.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe stock market came under pressure amid Trump trade war tariffs and threats over the past several weeks. President Donald Trump on Friday imposed tariffs on $34 billion worth of Chinese goods, quickly matched by Beijing. Trump also threatened tariffs on virtually all Chinese imports. But for now, Wall Street has decided the Trump trade impact has been priced into stocks.If you look at the Nasdaq composite over the last several months, the tech-heavy index looks like it broke out on June 1, rallied for a few weeks, then erased those gains before rebounding again last week from its 50-day moving average.The S&P 500 index and Dow Jones have been consolidating since late January, with the S&P 500 in somewhat better shape.Stocks, even top stocks, tend to track the broader stock market. But sector rotations into and out of China internets, software stocks and energy names have left many individual stock charts looking more volatile.Amazon stock and especially Netflix stock have been two of the biggest stock market winners in 2018. Facebook stock, after a scandalous spring, is at record highs, slightly extended from a buy point. Apple stock is in buy range from 179.04 double-bottom entry. The Dow Jones component has pulled back to its 50-day line and could be working on a new consolidation. Alphabet (GOOGL) is below a buy point after a low-volume breakout last month and hitting resistance at its old high.Software accounts for four of the top 10 groups in the 197 industries that IBD tracks. Two more are in the top 20.Buying and holding individual software stocks has been a challenge. Salesforce, the top stock in the No. 3-ranked enterprise software group, staged a low-volume breakout in early May, then promptly undercut the buy point. It didn't trigger a 7%-8% loss that would trigger an automatic sell. By the end of May, following quarterly earnings, Salesforce stock was back in buy range and is now modestly extended.Meanwhile, some stocks did trigger the 7%-8% loss sell rule, like Workday (WDAY) and Red Hat (RHT), while others round-tripped double-digit gains, such as Qualys (QLYS).Software Stocks To Watch: Okta (OKTA), an April 2017 cybersecurity IPO, is finding support at its 50-day moving average for the first time since a late April breakout. A solid gain in heavy volume could offer a buying opportunity. Alternatively, Okta could continue to consolidate for a few weeks, forming a new base and buy point.Collaboration software maker Atlassian (TEAM) broke out last October. Anyone holding Atlassian stock since then would be sitting pretty. Since then the stock has staged a few failed breakouts but still moved up, generally following its 50-day. Atlassian stock is once again finding 50-day support but needs at least another week to form a proper base.Lululemon Athletica and Canada Goose (GOOS) are among the trendy apparel retail stock that have boomed in 2018. Specialty discounters such as TJX are faring well too, with TJX rival Ross Stores (ROST) stock in buy range currently. Five Below (FIVE) and Dollar General (DG) are setting up near buy points.An improving jobs market and Trump tax cuts have fueled consumers' wallets and confidence. Most retailers also aren't that exposed to Trump trade wars with Europe, China and others.Energy stocks are tricky to play because they tend to rise and fall with crude prices. (Refiners tend to benefit from a wider ""crack spread"" between crude and gasoline prices.)EOG Resources (EOG), a recent IBD Stock of the Day, broke out in early May and ran up for a couple of weeks as crude futures rallied. But the EOG stock pulled back below the buy point and found support at the 50-day line in June as crude also backed off multiyear highs. EOG Resources, known as the ""Apple of Oil,"" is setting up in a new base with crude hitting its best levels since 2014.Marathon Oil, another IBD Stock of the Day, also broke out in early May and ran up. Marathon Oil stock also pulled back to its 50-day line, but never undercut the buy point. Shares are now in a flat base within a base-on-base formation.Biogen shot up nearly 20% to 357.48 on Friday, racing toward a 370.67 cup-base entry. Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) also is closing in on a buy point. But both Biogen and Vertex Pharma have relative strength lines, while improving, that were in downtrends for several months.

19,VRTX,"Italy's political chaos and President Donald Trump's tariffs weighed on the Dow Jones, but the Nasdaq moved to multi-month highs, as stocks rallied Friday on a strong but Fed-friendly jobs report. Lululemon (LULU), Momo (MOMO), VMware (VMW) soared on earnings, while Workday (WDAY) and dollar stores sold off on results. Walt Disney (DIS) retreated as ""Solo"" box office lagged and ABC canceled ""Roseanne"" after a racist tweet by Roseanne Barr.Italy's political chaos roiled global markets to start the week, with President Trump on Thursday announcing he would slap tariffs on the European Union, Canada and Mexico, which all retaliated.

Hourly wages rose 0.3%, slightly above views, but the 2.7% annual gain was in line. The Institute for Supply Management manufacturing index unexpectedly rose to a strong 58.7 in May as new orders surged.Momo (MOMO), which provides a mobile-based social networking platform in China, reported revenue of $435 million, up 64% vs. a year earlier and beating expectations of $396.3 million. Profit jumped 55% to 69 cents, topping estimates of 50 cents. Momo ended the quarter with 103.3 million monthly active users vs. 85.2 million a year earlier.

Momo stock soared.Salesforce.com (CRM) reported Q1 earnings and revenue that topped expectations and increased its full-year 2019 revenue outlook by $400 million to a range of $13.075 billion to $13.125 billion. About $300 million of the hike comes from its recent MuleSoft acquisition, which will be dilutive to margins and cash flows. Q1 deferred revenue increased 23% to $6.2 billion, just shy of estimates of $6.23 billion. Salesforce forecast July-quarter profit below analyst estimates. Shares rose 2%.Workday earned 33 cents a share, up 14% from a year ago. Revenue rose 29% to $618.6 million. Both topped views. But Q1 billings rose 8% to $496.6 million, missing estimates.

PVH (PVH), parent of Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein lines, posted $2.36 EPS on 16% sales growth to $2.3 billion. PVH stock fell Friday but edged up for the week, and Pursemaker Michael Kors (KORS) also topped, with 63 cents EPS and 11% revenue growth to $1.18 billion, but shares tumbled. Guess (GES) matched per-share loss views but beat sales estimates with 15% growth. Shares crashed on weak full-year guidance.""Solo: A Star Wars Story"" had the lowest start ever for a Disney ""Star Wars"" movie. The Han Solo origin story only brought in $103 million over the four day holiday weekend vs. the $130 million projection. It could be a sign of Star Wars fatigue. Disney's woes continued as ABC canceled its hit show ""Roseanne"" after its star Roseanne Barr tweeted a racial slur about Valerie Jarrett, an Obama Administration official.Dollar stores Dollar General (DG) and Dollar Tree (DLTR) both crashed after quarterly results missed estimates. Dollar General cited a ""significant weather-related headwind."" Dollar Tree cited ""headwinds related to increasing freight costs, colder-than-normal spring weather in many parts of the country and an earlier Easter holiday."" Warehouse club Costco's (COST) earnings topped estimates, but rising costs pressured gross margins. Shares pulled back from near a buy point.VMware (VMW) late Thursday said that adjusted Q1 earnings were $1.26 a share, up 18% from a year ago, topping estimates of $1.06 a share. Revenue rose 14% to $2.01 billion, topping estimates of $1.74 billion. VMware soared Friday, moving into a buy zone.Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF) stock tanked Friday on doubts their remodeled stores will pay off, despite the trendy apparel firm handily beating on Q1 estimates and guiding full-year revenue growth above views. Meanwhile rival American Eagle Outfitters (AEO) also slipped after reporting Thursday. This was despite a double beat and management guiding higher on Q2 EPS.Shares of Dick's Sporting Goods spiked higher on earnings, as profit rose 9% to 59 cents a share and revenue grew 5% to $1.91 billion, better than views for 42 cents EPS and $1.88 billion in sales.

Toyota Motor (TM) and Nissan (NSANY) saw new vehicle sales shrink. Analysts estimated General Motors (GM), which no longer reports monthly sales data, grew sales 12%. The annualized pace of May auto sales is estimated at 16.6 million. That would be down from April's 17.1 million rate and down from last May's 16.7 million. Nissan (NSANY), whose 4% sales decline last month followed a 28% plunge in April, is slashing car production in the U.S. and Mexico, as consumers continue to pile into SUVs and trucks. The Japanese automaker hopes to improve profitability rather than focus on market share.Ciena (CIEN) reported a second straight quarterly decline in gross margins, sending the optical gear maker's stock down, despite the company raising its revenue growth outlook for fiscal 2018 to 7% to 9% from 5% to 7%.PagSeguro (PAGS) stock swung back-and-forth amid worries over a truckers strike's impact on Brazil's economy while reporting Q1 earnings and revenue that topped views. The company has stepped up marketing for next-generation mobile payment devices it sells to small merchants.Box (BOX) stock fell as guidance disappointed, though Q1 profit and revenue edged past analyst estimates as large deal momentum continued for the online data storage and file-sharing service provider.Crispr Therapeutics (CRSP) tumbled Thursday after the Food and Drug Administration placed a clinical hold on its application to begin in-human studies of gene-editing drug, CTX001. CTX001 is being developed under a collaboration with Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) to treat sickle cell disease.Alibaba (BABA) is investing $1.38 billion in ZTO Express (ZTO) to bolster delivery and logistical capabilities. Shares of the express delivery company surged to a record high of 21.70.Universal Display (OLED) stock jumped nearly 18% on a news report that Apple (AAPL) might switch to all OLED displays for next year's new iPhones. But the gains quickly evaporated as analysts poured cold water on the speculation.Analog Devices (ADI) stock surged into the buy zone after the chipmaker beat its fiscal second-quarter targets and guided higher for the current quarter thanks to strong industrial and communications chip sales.MedMen, a large U.S. marijuana producer and retailer, began trading on the Canadian Securities Exchange on Tuesday, making it the latest big pot producer in either country to go public.

20,VRTX,"AstraZeneca (AZN), Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) and Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) are the likeliest targets of a biopharma ""detonation event"" in which tax reform spurs widespread mergers and acquisitions across the group, an analyst said Friday.Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez calls the coming consolidation ""inevitable.""Products made by the likes of AbbVie (ABBV), Roche (RHHBY), Amgen (AMGN), Dow Jones stock Merck (MRK), Celgene (CELG), Biogen (BIIB) and Shire (SHPG) are soon to face new competition and generic rivals.This follows ""an unprecedented period of innovation and new product launches within large biopharma,"" he said in a note to clients. ""Several of the largest companies will likely experience a substantial growth slowdown within the next five to seven years.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseCelgene, Biogen and AstraZeneca would be most accretive to a potential acquirer, based on short-term financials, Fernandez said. Their average accretion in 2020 would be 25%, 14% and 13%, respectively.But Bristol, AstraZeneca and Vertex make the most sense long-term and strategically, he said. These three appear to be ""best positioned"" for longer-term revenue growth based on a look at consensus expectations for 2020-24.The last major consolidation period in biopharma occurred during the last decade, in which there were seven deals greater than $40 billion in value. The largest was Dow Jones stock Pfizer's (PFE) $93.8 billion acquisition of Warner-Lambert, at a 34% premium.Pfizer also paid the biggest premium, 38%, on Pharmacia, forking over $60.5 billion to acquire the firm. Merck paid a 34% premium to buy Schering-Plough for $45.7 billion. Since 2010, deals combining Pfizer with AstraZeneca and Allergan (AGN) and AbbVie with Shire have failed.Fernandez sees the next cycle as a seller's market. Pfizer is struggling with its late entry to the immuno-oncology market, whereas Merck has a strong immuno-oncology drug — Keytruda — but lacks a robust late-stage pipeline.Roche faces biosimilar competition for its top drugs: Avastin, Herceptin and Rituxan. Novartis (NVS) is still experiencing challenges in its Sandoz unit. AbbVie is strong in the near-term, but its key drug Humira will soon see competition in Europe and in the U.S. after 2022.Strategically, AstraZeneca would be a strong fit for AbbVie, Pfizer, Roche or Merck, Fernandez said. Bristol could fit in at AbbVie and Pfizer. Meanwhile, it's possible AbbVie could swing for Vertex.Through a financial lens, AstraZeneca, Vertex, Biogen and Bristol are the most compelling targets for their ability to enhance long-term sales, he said.Amgen could be an acquirer or a target with $70 billion in funds to buy something, Fernandez said. Assuming Amgen is looking to make a deal valued at less than $90 billion, Vertex rises to the top of the list among the potential targets, outlasting Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) and Shire.""Among the three, Vertex looks more interesting,"" he said.RELATED:Chart-Reading Basics: How A Buy Point Marks A Time Of Real OpportunityLong-Term Retirement Investing Strategies With ETFsShould You Buy A Stock Ahead Of Its Earnings Report?

23,VRTX,"Payers likely won't balk at the $292,000 yearly price for Vertex Pharmaceuticals' (VRTX) new two-drug regimen to treat some cystic fibrosis patients, analysts said Tuesday after U.S. regulators approved the therapy.X The regimen, dubbed Symdeko, has a wholesale acquisition price that is 7% above another Vertex drug known as Orkambi. Both treat homozygous patients, meaning they have two of a specific genetic mutation that causes the lung condition. Symdeko also treats patients who have another genetic mutation.But Symdeko has better effectiveness and tolerability than Orkambi, Needham analyst Alan Carr said. Eventually, Vertex plans to have a triple-drug regimen, the firm says, that could treat up to 90% of the genetic mutations responsible for cystic fibrosis.""Symdeko's (effectiveness) and tolerability profile has modest-moderate improvements over Orkambi,"" Carr said in a note to clients. ""We assume a modest amount of switching from Orkambi to Symdeko as well as use by patients who did not tolerate Orkambi.""The approval was expected, but came 16 days before the FDA was set to discuss the combination of drugs tezacaftor and ivacaftor — the latter of which is branded as Kalydeco. In early trading on the stock market today, Vertex rose as much as 2.3%. Shares ended the regular trading day up 1.4% to 154.14.Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges notes Symdeko's label doesn't warn against respiratory events nor require monitoring for blood pressure and low-lung-function patients. These issues had limited Orkambi penetration to less than 60% of the addressable population, he said.""With the label advantages and double the (effectiveness), Symdeko could increase the homozygous penetration rate and provide robust top-line growth for Vertex through the clinical development period of the triple therapies,"" he said.Vertex guided to $2.65 billion to $2.8 billion in 2018 sales, bracketing the consensus for $2.75 billion, Porges said. He models $100 million growth for Kalydeco and 36% growth in the number of U.S. homozygous patients treated by Orkambi or Symdeko.IBD'S TAKE: The market broadly went through a correction last week and is still far off 2018 highs. Head to Investor's Corner to keep tabs on the top sell rules.The price increase of Symdeko over Orkambi wasn't fully expected by the consensus, Porges said. He noted that when Orkambi launched in 2015 it was at a discount to Kalydeco, which gained approval in 2012. Consensus estimates could rise to account for Symdeko's premium.""We do not expect much resistance to this premium from payers, physicians or patients, given the considerable advantages of Symdeko over Orkambi,"" he said.Now, investors are looking to the triple-drug regimen. Vertex plans to begin Phase 3 testing in the first half of the year for two potential combinations to treat both homozygous and another patient population known as heterozygous.Piper Jaffray analyst Edward Tenthoff said in a note he ultimately anticipates all patients with a specific genetic mutation ""will be consolidated onto TripleRX.""Vertex is also working with Crispr Therapeutics (CRSP) on gene editing to treat six diseases, including cystic fibrosis, Tenthoff wrote. The duo plan to begin trials this year in blood diseases known as beta thalassemia and sickle cell disease.This ""first-in-man potentially curative data could be a driver for Vertex shares this year,"" he said.RELATED:These Biotechs Could Spring Back After Market Correction: AnalystRegeneron Could Benefit From 'Lackluster' Data Presented By These RivalsIs Teva Pharma's Restructuring Plan Actually 'More Reasonable'?

28,VRTX,"Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) could have a triple-pill treatment for cystic fibrosis as early as 2019, analysts said Thursday after the biotech initiated the first of its Phase 3 studies to test the drugs involved.X The pivotal trial ""should be short and sweet,"" Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges said in a note to clients. Vertex announced late Wednesday it's beginning a trial combining drugs known as VX-659, tezacaftor and ivacaftor to treat a group of cystic fibrosis patients.""This timing is two to four months ahead of our expectations and even more importantly, the trial will be shorter than the company's prior pivotal studies for its cystic fibrosis combinations,"" Porges said.In total, Vertex plans to enroll 360 patients in the trial. The goal is to improve patients' ability to forcefully expel air at week four of treatment. Safety will be evaluated through 12 weeks of treatment. Then, Vertex could file an application for approval in the U.S.Porges expects the trial to enroll very quickly and suggests a regulatory submission could occur as early as the first half of 2019. This means Vertex could start selling its treatment as early as the fourth quarter of 2019, up from earlier expectations for the first quarter of 2020.Get IBD's Market Prep And Tech Report Newsletters — For Free!""Our goal is to bring the best triple combination to patients as rapidly as possible, and this first Phase 3 study in combination with tezacaftor and ivacaftor is a significant step toward that goal,"" Vertex Chief Medical officer Jeffrey Chodakewitz said in a statement.Triple regimens could treat up to 90% of patients with cystic fibrosis, Vertex has said. AbbVie (ABBV) and Galapagos (GLPG) also are working on triple combinations, but analysts say the duo is lagging Vertex.Vertex is also planning to test the regimen of VX-659, tezacaftor and ivacaftor in a group of patients with a different genetic mutation. Another regimen of VX-445 with tezacaftor and VX-561 will be tested in two groups of patients with different mutations.Porges kept his outperform rating and 190 price target on Vertex stock.

71,VRTX,"Celgene (CELG), Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) and Incyte (INCY) are worth watching amid a broader market correction that saw biotech stocks lose a collective 8% over the previous five days, an analyst said Tuesday.X Biotech stocks rebounded 1.9% on the stock market today, after diving 3.5% on Monday.BMO Capital Markets analyst Brian Belski said in a note to clients that investors are reaping what they sowed.""For all intents and purposes, the majority of clients, market pundits and especially an increasingly boisterous set of naysayers, have been predicting the bull market's imminent demise since the day after the 2016 U.S. presidential election,"" he said.But that doesn't mean the bull market is dead, Belski said. RBC analyst Brian Abrahams agreed — and sees some ""opportune entry points"" for certain biotechs stocks with data and/or approvals expected in 2018.Things are looking up for Celgene after a few missteps in the second half of 2017 — including a major miss in sales of psoriatic arthritis drug Otezla in the third quarter, Abrahams said. Sales of that drug rebounded in the fourth quarter.""We believe the market cap reduction more than reflected that, and we believe their fourth-quarter numbers and 2018 guidance point to reassuring stabilization of key U.S. Revlimid and Otezla sales,"" he said.IBD'S TAKE: A bull market is a good time review your stock-selling smarts because once it begins to stall out of an uptrend, it's too late to catch up. Head to the Investor's Corner to brush up on stock-selling rules.Cancer drug Revlimid is Celgene's biggest drug. Analysts have worried about generic rivals taking sales starting in 2022. To contend with that, Celgene recently announced its plan to acquire the remainder of Juno Therapeutics (JUNO) it didn't already own.Adding Juno to its coffers puts Celgene in the CAR-T space where it will compete against Novartis (NVS) and Gilead Sciences (GILD) — the latter via its acquisition of Kite Pharma. CAR-T therapies teach the immune system to identify and fight cancer.But even without Juno, Celgene looks poised to generate enough cash flow to buy back virtually its entire enterprise value before Revlimid goes completely generic in 2026, Abrahams said.Outside that, Abrahams sees a number of 2018 catalysts including additional data for Revlimid in treating lymphoma and late-stage data for drug luspatercept, with partner Acceleron Pharma (XLRN), in blood disorders.Celgene rose 2.7% to 96.25 on Tuesday.Abrahams says Vertex was ""a victim of bad timing."" Vertex recently reported strong data for its triple-combination regimens in cystic fibrosis. But the data came out just as the broader markets were beginning to turn and the stock fell hard the past two days. But Vertex rebounded Tuesday, rising 2.7% to 159.27.Strong effectiveness from drugs known as VX-659 and VX-445 in two triple regimens heading into Phase 3 studies support the likelihood that Vertex can expand into a tough-to-treat population of cystic fibrosis patients, he said.It also enables ""multiple additional shots on goal and sets a bar that will be difficult to match or beat — and with significant lead time — likely rendering mid-year competitive data from Galapagos (GLPG) (an overhang on Vertex shares) much less impactful.""He raised his price target on Vertex to 200. The macro weakness is masking improved fundamentals, Abrahams argued.Incyte is set to read out data from a Phase 3 trial known as Echo-301 in the first half of 2018. The study combined Incyte's immuno-oncology drug epacadostat with Dow stock Merck's (MRK) Keytruda in late-stage melanoma.Both drugs belong to a class known as immuno-oncology treatments. Epacadostat works to block interactions involving the IDO enzyme in the immune system. Keytruda is called a PD-1 inhibitor, which has a similar interaction with the PD-L1 protein.Instinet analyst Christopher Marai expects the trial will read out positively and could be similar to a regimen of Bristol-Myers Squibb's (BMY) drugs Opdivo and Yervoy. Bristol is also combining these drugs to treat other cancers, including advanced lung cancer.If so, ""epacadostat could become part of the standard of care in metastatic melanoma with broad adoption augmenting current anti-PD-1 use,"" he said in a note to clients. That could lead to peak worldwide sales north of $1 billion in melanoma alone for epacadostat.But RBC's Abrahams says eventually nearly all the value for epacadostat will soon be gone from Incyte's shares. He sees $65 per share for Jakafi, which treats a bone marrow disorder, and $8 per share for Olumiant, a rheumatoid arthritis drug co-developed with Eli Lilly (LLY).This ""suggests downside if upcoming epacadostat data are negative is now likely only about $10 per share, with fundamental upside now potentially more than 50%,"" he said. This ""makes the upside/downside at these levels that much more interesting.""Incyte advanced 3.3% to 88.11 on Tuesday.RELATED:Allergan Pops On Consensus-Topping Quarter, Strong Migraine TrialThese Biotech Stocks Each Dived More Than 20% — Is The Sell-Off Overdone?Can CRISPR And These 3 Small Biotechs Cure 10,000 Diseases?

See How IBD Helps You Make More Money In StocksAlkermes broke out earlier, but has fallen back below the prior 60.60 entry from a cup with handle. If a stock you're tracking climbs above a buy point then falls 7% or more below the original entry price, it's considered a failed base. It's best to wait for the stock to form a new pattern and breakout. Also understand that the latest pattern is a later-stage base, and those involve more risk. Earnings grew 107% last quarter, up from 0% in the prior report. Revenue also increased, from 21% to 29%.

76,VRTX,"Ligand Pharmaceuticals (LGND) is a biotech worth $4 billion, but it doesn't market a single drug — yet in 2018 it's expected to approach $200 million in sales and its stock is breaking out.X The reason is Ligand operates under a unique business model in which it acquires early-stage technologies necessary for drug development. It then licenses those platforms out to biotechs and pharmas like Dow Jones stocks Merck (MRK) and Pfizer (PFE), as well as Amgen (AMGN) and Novartis (NVS).In total, Ligand has more than 165 programs in development with north of 95 partners, the firm said during its fourth-quarter conference call in February. Craig-Hallum Capital Group analyst Matt Hewitt praised the model in a Feb. 22 report to clients.""Given a larger-than-ever and expanding portfolio of current and potential future royalty generating assets, a broad pipeline of partnerships, and a model inherently geared to deliver very high profit margins, we believe there is tremendous value creation in motion at Ligand,"" he said.Shareholders seem to agree with Hewitt's assessment. Ligand stock has popped more than 27% since the beginning of the year, outperforming the broader biotech group, which has risen roughly 11% over the same time period.On Thursday, shares jumped in early-morning trades to break out of a second-stage, six-week flat base. Shares ended the regular session up 4% to 174.70.Ligand shares have been on a run since last week, jumping at least 2% per day during a stretch of three straight trading sessions. Meanwhile, the biotech group has been in the red for four of the past seven sessions.The stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 98 out of a best-possible 99, meaning it performs in the top 2% of all stocks in terms of key growth metrics. In the biotech group, it's ranked third behind Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) and Halozyme Therapeutics (HALO), which both have ratings of 99.Ligand demonstrated its dominance in the fourth quarter. Total revenue grew 32.2% to $50.46 million, topping the consensus for $47 million, Roth Capital Partners analyst Scott Henry wrote in a recent note to clients.Royalties, the main driver of sales, increased 44.6% to $28.3 million, in line with expectations, Henry said. The upside to revenue drove adjusted earnings per share of $1.31, spiking 77% vs. the year-earlier quarter and beating analyst views by 25 cents.Better-than-expected sales of Amgen's Kyprolis and Novartis' Promacta led the revenue charge. Ligand gets a 4.7%-9.4% royalty on sales of Promacta, an oral medicine to increase the number of platelets in the blood, and a 1.5%-3% royalty on sales of multiple myeloma drug Kyprolis.In total, Ligand is tied to a dozen commercial products. It has five technology platforms that biotechs and pharmas can use to develop drugs. The firm also has a handful of early-stage drugs it plans to license out to interested companies for further development.Ligand's goal is to create a diversified company ""with more licensing opportunities and lower impact of individual patent expiry,"" the firm says. That protects it from the scenario now facing biotech leader Celgene (CELG) which will see its patents on cancer drug Revlimid begin to expire in the mid-2020s.Use IBD's MarketSmith For Free Until March 11

77,VRTX,"See stocks near a buy point, get chart pattern recognition and run custom screens. Start NowAmong its recent successes, Ligand announced this week that it had partnered with drug holding firm Roivant Sciences on diabetes drug LGD-6972. Roivant's company, Metavant, will develop the drug which had strong Phase 2 data in the second half of 2017.""This is a major partnership that has the potential to generate substantial medical value for both type 1 and type 2 diabetes patients,"" Ligand Chief Executive John Higgins said in a prepared statement. ""If LGD-6972 is successfully developed, this license with Roivant has the potential to be Ligand's largest financial asset with the possibility of annual royalties (continuing) in the late 2030s.""All this could offer upside to 2018 guidance for $116 million in royalty revenue, $23 million in sales related to Captisol — a compound used in pharma development — and $25 million related to milestones and license fees, analysts say.""Ligand tends to under-promise and over-deliver when it comes to annual guidance,"" Roth Capital's Henry said. ""We expect 2018 to be more of the same. Our revenue and (earnings-per-share) targets of $166 million and $4.28, which we view as conservative, should surpass the company's guidance.""Henry expects Kyprolis and Promacta sales to moderate in 2018. He calls for Kyprolis sales to grow 19%, down from 26% in 2017, and for Promacta sales to increase 20%, down from 37% in 2017. Any sustained movement for these drugs could provide upside to the guidance, he said.Ligand, though, is bullish on both drugs. CEO Higgins called for Kyprolis and Promacta to both become blockbusters in 2018. Promacta has been on the market for nine years, so seeing that level of growth is ""particularly impressive,"" he said on the earnings call.""In 2018, Promacta will become a $1 billion molecule, with analysts projecting continued strong growth beyond,"" he said. ""And for Kyprolis, given recently reported sales numbers, that drug appears to us to also be on track to exceed $1 billion in worldwide sales in 2018.""Ligand's partners currently have a handful of drugs in late-stage testing including brexanolone, a postpartum depression drug from Sage Therapeutics (SAGE), and a slew of others in Phase 2 trials. Of its partnered programs, 42% are preclinical and 25% are in Phase 1 studies.The firm expects to benefit from current trends including the new U.S. tax law, which reduced Ligand's projected tax rate by more than one-third, Higgins said on the earnings call. Ligand also will get a boost from a bump in FDA drug approvals.A recent study by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology found the success rate of drug programs advancing to approval has increased.""We believe this can be attributed to many factors, including better decisions with advancing programs and a more favorable regulatory environment,"" he said. ""This is very meaningful for Ligand, as we have over 165 programs at all stages of development.""RELATED:How To Tame A Volatile Swing Trade With A Half PositionHow To Trade Stocks: Why Most Penny Stocks Fail To Make Investors RichLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

81,VRTX,"Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) beat fourth-quarter sales expectations by more than 9% and has selected a pair of cystic fibrosis treatments to send into late-stage testing, the company said late Wednesday.X Vertex reported adjusted income of 61 cents per share on $651.6 million in sales, rising a respective 74% and 42% vs. the year-earlier period. Both metrics beat the consensus for adjusted profit of 58 cents a share on $596 million in sales.Of its total sales, Vertex brought in $621 million in revenue from cystic fibrosis treatments, growing 37% year over year. Its biggest drug, Orkambi, increased 32% to $365 million and Kalydeco, also known as ivacaftor, tacked on 44% growth to $256 million.Chief Executive Jeffrey Leiden called 2017 ""an outstanding year for Vertex,"" in a written statement.""As we look at 2018 and beyond, Vertex's scientific expertise and financial strength position us to advance key pipeline programs in CF, including our triple combination regimens and bring forth potential new medicines in multiple other serious diseases.""In after-hours trading on the stock market today, Vertex popped 3.2% after closing up 0.2%, to 166.87, during the regular session.The triple-pill treatments are expected to treat up to 90% of cystic fibrosis patients, said Jeffrey Chodakewitz, Vertex's executive vice president and chief medical officer. Vertex plans to send combos using the drugs known as VX-659 and VX-445 into late-stage testing this year.""We look forward to concluding our discussions with regulators and initiating Phase 3 development in the first half of the year, with the goal of bringing a triple regimen to patients as quickly as possible,"" Chodakewitz said in a written statement.Excitement has been building surrounding the potential triple-pill, which targets the underlying genetic cause of the disease. In total, Vertex had four potential combinations it was considering.Vertex has now narrowed that down to two potential combinations. A combination of VX-659, tezacaftor and ivacaftor will begin two Phase 3 trials in the first half of 2018. The two studies will investigate the regimen's effect in two patient groups with different genetic mutations.IBD'S TAKE: Vertex wasn't always a cystic fibrosis-focused company. In its earliest days, it was focused on hepatitis C until Gilead Sciences launched a massively successful drug called Sovaldi in 2011. How did Vertex escape that crisis? Head to The New America for more.Pending additional data in the first half of the year, Vertex also plans to send a combination of VX-445 with tezacaftor and a drug called VX-561 into Phase 3 testing as a once-daily treatment in two groups of patients with different genetic mutations.Vertex selected the treatments based on ongoing studies which show absolute improvements in patients' ability to forcefully expel air for one second. Those treated with VX-659 and VX-445 regimens showed improvements of 13.3 and 13.8 percentage points, respectively, through four weeks of treatment in some cystic fibrosis patients.The triple combinations were generally well tolerated across both studies, Vertex said, with the majority of adverse events mild or moderate in severity. Discontinuation rates due to adverse events were low.Vertex isn't the only firm seeking to make a triple-regimen to treat cystic fibrosis. AbbVie (ABBV) and Galapagos (GLPG) have also teamed up to make a triple-pill. But analysts have said the duo is several years behind. Most see Vertex's triple getting approval in the 2019-20 time frame.In February, Vertex expects to get approval in the U.S. for a regimen of tezacaftor and ivacaftor as a treatment for cystic fibrosis patients ages 12 and older with a specific genetic mutation. European regulators will make their determination in the second half of 2018.Vertex said it will issue 2018 guidance for cystic fibrosis drug sales after the anticipated U.S. approval for the tezacaftor and ivacaftor regimen on Feb. 28. Analysts expect Vertex to offer an outlook of $2.89 a share in adjusted earnings on $2.73 billion in sales.Vertex is also planning to move forward with Crispr Therapeutics (CRSP) using gene therapy to treat blood diseases known as beta thalassemia and sickle cell disease. Trials are expected to begin this year in Europe and the U.S.RELATED:Biotech With 210% Growth Testing Buy Zone, Gets New Drug ApprovalWhich Biotech Stocks Could Surprise To The Upside On Earnings?Why These 2 Biotechs Could Outperform Amid 'Hyper-Competition'

82,VRTX,"With the S&P 500 index, Nasdaq composite and Dow industrials suffering their worst weekly losses in two years, it's not surprising that top-rated growth stocks retreated. Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX), Apple (AAPL) supplier Qorvo (QRVO), Atlassian (TEAM), IPG Photonics (IPGP), Paylocity (PCTY) and Cypress Semiconductor (CY) all broke out recently, but in the past week or so have slipped modestly below buy points.X These stocks are worth keeping on watch lists, in case they retake their buy points, preferably with robust price gains and in strong volume. Keep in mind that the market uptrend is under pressure. Investors should be cautious about new purchases, quick to cut losses and may want to consider taking some profits in winning stocks.But with futures selling off hard once again, it's likely that many of these stock futures will come under further pressure at the open.Vertex Pharmaceuticals cleared a 167.95 buy point in late January, closing above that level on Jan. 26, but in below-average volume. Shares of the biotech dipped just below the entry. They retook the buy point on Feb. 1 with a 3.7% jump in strong volume. That followed strong earnings and Vertex choosing two cystic fibrosis treatments for late-stage testing. But the stock fell 3.9% to 166.24 in Friday's market sell-off.Vertex fell 1.1% to 164.45 in morning trade on the stock market today.Vertex's relative strength line, which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, has been lagging. (The RS line is the blue line in the charts below.) The lagging RS line reflects the stock's sideways action during its seven-month shallow consolidation, while the S&P 500 and the broader market rallied strongly.Vertex is a member of Leaderboard, IBD's premium service offering annotated charts of a handful of stocks, mostly growth names in or near buy zones.Chipmaker Qorvo gets an estimated 34% of its revenue from Apple. That may rise further thanks to a big new contract win for the Apple iPhone announced last week.Qorvo's stock had been trending lower since early November and its RS line had fallen to a 52-week low as of late last month. But Qorvo shot up 16% on Thursday to 83.34 on the Apple iPhone wind, vaulting above an 81.30 cup-without-handle base buy point. That capped a 26% rally over five sessions.On Friday, shares retreated 3.1% to 80.77, after Apple itself plunged 4.3% on weak iPhone sales and guiding low on current-quarter revenue. Other Apple chipmakers also sold off.Qorvo shares were down 0.1% in morning trade while Apple rose modestly from a 200-day test.Qorvo's RS line is well off the highs of its recent consolidation and late May's peak, but did shoot up last week with the stock and jump above a short-term high.IBD'S TAKE: While some recent breakouts are struggling, others have weathered the recent market retreat. Facebook leads five top stocks holding in buy zones.Atlassian, which makes collaboration software for businesses, cleared a 53.55 buy point on Jan. 16, closing above that level on Jan. 17 and rising as high as 55.91 on Jan. 18, with all three sessions in strong volume. After the Jan. 18 closing bell, Atlassian gave weak earnings guidance after topping fiscal second-quarter estimates.Shares fell 4.55% to 53.07 on Jan. 19, back below the entry. Since then shares have been hovering just above below the buy point. On Friday, shares fell 1% to 52.72 in light volume.Atlassian shares fell 2.3% to 51.53 in morning trade Monday.The RS line is lagging, but not much. A strong retaking of the buy point could not only claim a short-term high but also approach the November peaks.IPG Photonics shot up 6.8% to 258.84 on Jan. 8, part of a 21% surge to start 2018 as it ran up the right side of a short cup-without-handle base. That pushed the stock to the near the top of the 5% buy zone from the 248.33 entry. The fiber laser maker's RS line almost hit a new high on a daily chart, and did hit a new high on the weekly chart.IPG's shares then moved sideways, moving slightly extended from the buy point. Then shares began pulling back on Jan. 24, but in light volume and closing within buy range through Thursday. On Friday, the stock slid 2.1% to 246.75, back below the entry, but on volume that was 51% below normal.IPG shares lost 2% Monday morning.The RS line is now lagging, as the stock has drifted lower over several weeks while the market fared better.Paylocity is a cloud-based provider of payroll and human resources software, mostly for small- to mid-sized businesses.The stock cleared a 50.62 cup-with-handle buy point on Jan. 29, but in volume that was only 17% above normal. The RS line cleared a short-term high, but was still near the bottom of its consolidation. Shares kept rising until reversing lower on Thursday. On Friday, shares slid 1.7% to 50.60 in volume that was 26% above normal.Palocity dipped 0.3% to 50.43 intraday.Paylocity is in strong field. Paycom (PAYC) has fallen back into a buy zone ahead of earnings Tuesday night. Workday (WDAY), which targets larger enterprises, is one of the five leading stocks cited in the IBD'S TAKE above that is still in a buy zone.Cypress Semi closed above a 17.52 buy point on Jan. 20, but in light volume and with a lagging RS line. Two sessions later, the stock fell back below the entry. Cypress moved back into the buy zone on Jan. 29, again in light trade, but then pulled just below the entry once again.Cypress reported stronger-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings and sales late Thursday and gave bullish Q1 guidance. Shares fell just 1 cent to 17.15 on Friday. But Cypress lost 3.1% Monday morning.A strong retaking of the buy point likely would push the RS line above a short-term high.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Stocks Fall Broadly; Is A True Correction Near?Did You See The Big Flaws In These IBD 50 Stocks' Charts?Anatomy Of A Chart: Breaking Down The Buy And Sell Zones

Volume was 2% below normal. You'd like to see volume rise at least 40%-50% above average on a breakout.On Monday, Vertex reversed lower, losing 1.2% to 167.14, back below the entry.

WTI crude oil futures reversed from small early losses and edged 0.2% higher to $63.49 a barrel.Diamondback Energy (FANG), an IBD Leaderboard play, jumped more than 3% to 132.21 and extended gains past a 115.03 buy point to nearly 15%.GE, the focus of a front-page story in the latest IBD Weekly, has a $139 billion market cap and 8.67 billion shares outstanding. At the end of the devastating 2008-09 bear market, GE traded as low as 5.73 a share, equivalent to a $49 billion market value at that time.The Nasdaq 100 — led by 1%-plus gains from tech heavyweights Alphabet (GOOGL), Intel (INTC) and Microsoft (MSFT) — lifted 0.8%. The S&P 500 gained 0.8% while the Dow Jones industrial average lagged, up nearly 0.6%.Apple (AAPL), the largest company on the Nasdaq and a Dow 30 component, fell 0.8% to 177 but volume was dull. The iPhone giant, despite getting new downgrades, is not triggering any sell signals.

Volume rose on the Nasdaq and was sharply down on the NYSE, according to preliminary data.GE, part of the 30-stock Dow industrials, is now trading 33% below its 200-day moving average, which too has been falling hard since May of last year. Excluding the brief flash crash of August 2015, the last time GE fell this hard below the important long-term level was all the way back in March 2009, the tail end of the market's severe slide after topping in November 2007.Plus, notice how a rally in early January this year failed to keep GE shares above their 50-day moving average for long. Healthy stocks trade above their 50-day moving average, which in turn leads the 200-day moving average higher. For GE, the opposite is occurring.Technically speaking, GE could find some buyers among the value investing crowd. However, as noted in this GE feature by IBD, GE faces the unenviable task of deciding whether to maintain positions in the power, aviation and health care markets, or to sell more parts of itself to become leaner and meaner.GE's attractiveness as a dividend play has definitely lost its luster after the board approved a 50% haircut in the quarterly dividend to 12 cents a share in November.Within the Dow Jones industrial average, fellow component Verizon Communications (VZ) makes IBD's Dividend Leaders screen. The telecom giant, which has a 4.5% annualized yield and a terrific three-year Earnings Stability Factor of 5 on a scale of zero to 99, rose nearly 2% to 52.89 in fast turnover. A move past 53.79, 10 cents above the high in the handle of a long saucer base, could present a timely buy point.The Street expects Verizon to post a 2% rise in fourth-quarter profit to 88 cents a share on a 3% lift in revenue to $33.25 billion.

132,VRTX,"Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) Chief Executive Jeffrey Leiden calls 2017 a ""transformational year"" for the biotechnology company, which looks likely to end the year with about $2 billion on its balance sheet and a rapidly approaching approval for a key cystic fibrosis treatment.X The company's stock price reflects its successes in the year. Shares have almost doubled year to date, rising 96% to outperform Investor's Business Daily's 460-company Biotech industry group, which has climbed more than 24% since January.As the year began, Leiden told IBD he laid out a three-part strategy beginning in 2017. Among his goals: Expand the number of eligible patients for Vertex's cystic fibrosis, or CF drugs, expand the pipeline outside of the lung disease sector and strengthen its financial stance.Leiden says some of those goals came to fruition in 2017. He expects to continue on the same trajectory as Vertex sends potential triple-pill regimens to treat cystic fibrosis into pivotal trials next year and dives deeper into treating other diseases with Crispr Therapeutics (CRSP) and Moderna Therapeutics.""So, when you really look at where we started the year, approved for a bit less than half of all patients with (cystic fibrosis) and we ended the year with medicines we believe will be able to get us up to 90% of patients,"" he said. ""You know, that's a very significant expansion of the patient population we think we can treat.""Here's what Leiden had to say about Vertex's plans, examining the company's strategy for both inside and outside of cystic fibrosis medications:IBD: What major accomplishments did Vertex have in 2017?Leiden: In expanding medicines for cystic fibrosis, I'd say (we had) four very important accomplishments. One, the (U.S. Food and Drug Administration's) approval for Kalydeco (for patients with) residual function mutations (which had previously been declined by the FDA). So that's 1,500 more patients in the U.S. Very importantly, it was a breakthrough with respect to regulatory science. This was, I think, the first approval ever of a medicine for new patient populations based just on in-vitro data, cellular data. It's really a testament, I think, to us working with the FDA to get them to appreciate and trust the strength of our cell-based assay that can predict (effectiveness).In Europe, we successfully obtained reimbursement for Orkambi, in particular, but also Kalydeco in a number of countries, particularly Ireland and Italy, also the Netherlands. That expanded the number of patients who are now reimbursed for our medicines there.IBD'S TAKE: Vertex was near a crisis point in 2014 when it pulled a blockbuster hepatitis C drug from the market amid mounting competition from Gilead Sciences (GILD). See how the pivot to cystic fibrosis transformed the company by visiting The New America.The third one was obviously the positive Phase 3 data for tezacaftor/ivacaftor (to treat cystic fibrosis) and that data was highly positive in two different trials. We were able to very quickly submit regulatory applications for both to the FDA and the (European Medicines Agency). And we expect approval of that medicine in the first quarter of next year in the U.S. and in the first half of third quarter in Europe. And that's going to pick up a large number of patients who, today, are not taking a CFTR corrector (which targets certain gene mutations), particularly those patients who had difficulty tolerating Orkambi. So we're talking about thousands of additional patients that would be eligible for tezacaftor/ivacaftor next year.The final one and, in a way, the most important one for the long run was, we announced Phase 1 and Phase 2 data for three of our different triple-regimens, so called next-generation regimens. That data told us that we're going to be able to reach up to 90% of all patients with CF with a single triple-combination medicine. And the data was strong enough we're confident we'll be able to start the pivotal trials, the final trials, for those medicines in the first half of next year.Expanding the pipeline beyond CF is something we haven't talked about as much, yet. But you'll be hearing a lot more in 2018. These new programs are in very serious disorders like sickle cell disease and alpha-1 antitrypsin disease (an inherited disorder that may cause lung and liver ailments) and are moving forward really nicely, thankfully faster than we expected. We hope to get at least one and maybe two of those medicines in the clinic next year and we'll start to talk more about them. But they're medicines that are very much like our CF medicines. They treat the underlying cause of the disease, they're transformational and we're really excited we're able to move those forward because we ultimately want to be a serious diseases company, not just a CF company.In terms of the financial strength of the company, we will likely end the year with close to or more than $2 billion on our balance sheet based upon the increased number of patients we can treat with CF. And that's really important to us, not because we want to build a big balance sheet, but because it gives us the financial wherewithal to both invest in our internal research programs to make more new medicines, but also to go out and do some business development deals that will allow us to enhance our pipeline even further.IBD: What can we expect to see in 2018 from Vertex?Leiden: We look at the same goals: Expand access to CF medicines, develop the pipeline beyond CF and produce more financial strength. I think the things you should look for in 2018 from us are, first, the tezacaftor/ivacaftor approval in the U.S. and Europe. That's very, very important because that will allow those patients to get access to the medicine. Second, expanding access even further for Orkambi, particularly in Europe.There's a couple of countries where we're still negotiating: France and the U.K. And we want to try to finish those negotiations for reimbursement in Europe next year. The start of the pivotal trials for either one or two triple regimens in the first half of next year. That's a very important milestone for the company and for patients. And the final one is watching for those first programs to get into the clinic outside of CF. The two that seem to be furthest along now are in sickle cell disease and alpha-1 antitrypsin disease.IBD: Can you make any predictions for the broader biotech group?Leiden: I think it's really the most exciting time in biotech in the 30 to 40 years I've been doing this. For two reasons. One, some of the new therapeutics technologies like gene editing, gene therapy that are really coming to maturity now, cell-based therapies. We're going to see all of those become viable therapies in the next five years and that's unbelievably exciting.We're seeing it already with immunotherapy with CAR-T cells, you'll see it soon with gene editing and gene therapies. So there are lots of new therapeutic modalities that allow us and others to attack diseases that were hard to attack. That's one side of the equation. The other side of the equation is we're just now getting a much better understanding of the biology in some of these diseases, meaning we're getting better at picking the targets.Most drug failures today are because you can't make a drug that targets your target; it's because you picked the wrong target. So the better we understand the biology — and we as an industry are understanding the biology much better — the higher probability of success. So I think when you take those two advances together, we're going to see a pretty significant kind of acceleration in breakthrough therapies.RELATED:Galapagos Pops To Vertex's Detriment — But Can It Compete?Vertex Pops As Analyst Questions Whether Rival Has 'Viable Drug'Three Biotech Firms Top Third-Quarter Views — But Only One Pops

135,VRTX,"Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) popped Tuesday after it and Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) were listed as top biotech stock picks for 2018 amid ""hyper-competition, pricing pressure and uncertain (merger) activity"" likely to dominate the year.X Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges pegs Vertex and Alexion as leaders in 2018 as their rivals struggle with mounting competition and rely on pricing hikes to sustain top-line growth. Both have strong management teams and attractive franchises that could garner takeover interest.""Our analysis leads us to believe that the best performing stocks in the foreseeable future will be those participating in categories with high barriers to entry, that rely on volume growth rather than positive price contribution,"" he said in a note to clients.By the closing bell on the stock market today, Alexion climbed 3.7% to finish at 124.05. Vertex rose 2% to finish at 152.90. Vertex shares ended 2017 up 103% with Alexion down 2%. Meanwhile, the broader biotech group wrapped the year up 32%.Vertex was the second best performer of the top 10 biotechs by market cap, easily leading Amgen (AMGN), Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Celgene (CELG) which ended the year up a respective 19%, flat and down 10%. Alnylam Pharmaceuticals (ALNY) led the top 10, rocketing 239%.Vertex has monopolized the cystic fibrosis category with drugs known as Kalydeco and Orkambi, Porges said. Its nearest competitor, Galapagos (GLPG), is at a time disadvantage and its products haven't shown the same effectiveness as Vertex's.""Despite the lucrative commercial opportunity that cystic fibrosis presents, the high barriers to entry in this therapeutic indication have precluded the emergence of a clear, viable threat to Vertex's cystic fibrosis franchise,"" he said.IBD'S TAKE: The median tenure of chief executives at large-cap biotechs fell to just one year in 2017, plunging from 11 years in 2007. That could have an impact on mergers and acquisitions in 2018, an analyst said last week. Head to IBD Industry Themes for a closer look.In the first quarter, Vertex is likely to gain approval for a combination of drugs known as tezacaftor and ivacaftor to treat some cystic fibrosis patients. This should gain traction among patients who discontinued treatment with Orkambi due to tolerability.This year will also be key for Vertex's triple-pill regimen to treat cystic fibrosis, he said. Vertex is planning to begin pivotal trials in the first half of 2018. Most analysts expect a triple-pill to gain approval in 2019-'20.Alexion, meanwhile, has seen 20% revenue growth for a drug known as Soliris over the past two years as a treatment for a pair of blood disorders. This increase in sales was mostly due to volume increases with little price contribution, Porges said.In October, the Food and Drug Administration approved Soliris to treat a muscle disease, which should help continue the sales trend, he said. Alexion is also working on a follow-on drug known as ALXN1210 with a favorable dosing schedule and potentially better effectiveness.Porges expect ALXN1210 to prove superior to Soliris in treating a blood disease known as paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria in Phase 3 testing. That should result in high conversion rates to ALXN1210 from Soliris when it's likely approved in 2019.""This catalyst should also extend the terminal cash flow horizon for Alexion's key franchise from mid-2020s to the mid-2030s, when patents for ALXN1210 expire,"" he said.Further, Alexion said late Tuesday its board of directors agreed to work with activist investor Elliott Management to identify a new board member. In November, Alexion said it had a search underway to fill an open board seat and is looking for candidates from a range of backgrounds, skills and expertise.RELATED:Q&A: Vertex Chief Talks About Company's 'Transformational Year'Why Biotech Stocks May Wait A While Before Feeling The LoveWhy This Biotech Could See 30% Upside In The Second Quarter

138,VRTX,"The median tenure of chief executives at large-cap biotech companies was just one year in 2017, plunging from 11 years in 2007, amid key transition periods at Amgen (AMGN), Celgene (CELG), Biogen (BIIB) and Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX), an analyst said Wednesday.X New chief executives also tend to hold onto less power, with under 30% of biotech chiefs having dual titles of CEO and board chairman compared with 100% of pharma chiefs in 2017, Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges wrote in a note to clients.""We believe investors, understandably, find it hard to have confidence in these new executives given their lack of track record, and the recent history of the group is unlikely to inspire confidence,"" he said.Investors are also likely to view these executives as having less power to broker mergers and acquisitions, contributing to expectations for relatively modest deal activity in 2018 despite the improved cash positions of most large-caps, Porges said.Through the 2000s, biotech companies were operated by chief executives with long tenures, mostly scientific backgrounds, proven track records, and familiarity to investors, Porges said. A number of CEOs were founder-scientists or carefully chosen successors.IBD'S TAKE: Large-cap biotechs were frustrated in 2017 as smaller plays and newer medicines started taking share. Analysts say the trend will continue in 2018. Head to IBD Industry Themes for a breakdown on what it means for the biggest stocks.The collapse of median large-cap biotech CEO tenures over the past 10 years followed an uptick from six years in 2002 to 11 years in 2007. Meanwhile, pharma companies saw a rotation of CEOs with business and law degrees and a median duration of experience under three years in both 2002 and 2007.""However, this imbalance reversed itself in the early 2010s, and by 2012 the median biotech CEO tenure had declined to match pharma at two years,"" Porges said.In 2017, the median CEO tenure at large-cap U.S. pharmaceuticals was five years. CEOs at pharmas have maintained their dual roles at chief executives and chairman 80%-100% of the time. But biotech CEOs had that dual role just 40%-60% of the time from 2002-12.This is ""likely as a result of the high prevalence of physician/scientist-founders that often had a senior business leader in the chairman position,"" Porges said.He sees pros and cons for a company that combines its chief executive and chairman positions under one hat.""But we believe the lack of strong authority in these leadership positions in biotech companies is certainly suggestive of a lack of immediate opportunity for transformative changes in companies or industry structure,"" he said. ""Investors who are dissatisfied with the company performance are also likely to find these divided title arrangements more vulnerable to challenges and change than entrenched CEO-chairmen.""RELATED:Which Companies Are Now Outperforming 95% Of All Stocks?Stocks Rise But Apple, Bitcoin Fall; This Play Pays Big DividendsHow Tax Reform Impacts Your Tax Bracket And Rate

Amazon (AMZN) and Boeing (BA) delivered strong results while Facebook (FB) touted strong ad rates. Alibaba (BABA) missed on earnings. PayPal (PYPL) crashed as former parent eBay (EBAY) moved to cut ties. A move by Amazon, JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) to team up to tackle health care costs hit insurers and pharmacy benefit managers. The Bitcoin meltdown continuedX After a hot start to 2018, the major averages suffered their worst weekly losses in two years, with the S&P 500 down 3.9%, the Dow 4.1% and the Nasdaq 3.5% as rising bond yields worldwide pressured stocks. UnitedHealth (UNH), CVS Health (CVS) and many other insurers fell on an Amazon-JPMorgan-Berkshire health care joint venture. Amazon, Boeing and Facebook were earnings winners, Alibaba was a notable loser, while Apple (AAPL) did OK.Bitcoin plummeted below $8,000 as 2018 losses accelerate as Facebook joined a chorus of regulators worldwide cracking down on cryptocurrencies.Apple (AAPL) earnings per share rose 16% year over year, on sales of $88.3 billion, up 13%, for the fiscal first quarter. Both narrowly beat expectations. Apple sold 77.3 million iPhones vs. the consensus for 80 million units, but average selling prices due to its new iPhone X and iPhone 8 models fueled overall results. For the March quarter, Apple expects sales of $61 billion, based on the midpoint of guidance, below official estimates for $65.4 billion. Shares fell 4.3% on Friday to a new three-month low.The e-commerce leader reported adjusted earnings of $3.75 a share, smashing the consensus of $1.85. A big benefit from tax cuts helped. Revenue rose 38% to $60.5 billion, also beating. Revenue from Amazon Web Services rose 46% to $5.1 billion. Sales of its Echo line of smart speakers far exceed expectations, Amazon (AMZN) said. Shares gained 3%, hitting a new high intraday.Facebook (FB) reported robust earnings and revenue growth that topped Q4 forecasts. User growth cooled while users' time spent on Facebook fell, even before its latest big News Feed changes. But executives said on the conference call that ad rates are soaring, easing analysts' revenue fears. Shares hit a record high Thursday.Alphabet (GOOGL) shares fell after the Google parent reported Q4 adjusted earnings were $9.70 a share, up 28% from a year earlier, missing views. Traffic acquisition costs, what Google pays partner websites to carry ads, soared 33% to $6.45 billion. Google expects the rise in TAC to moderate after Q1. Google's rising TAC has been linked to a contract renewal with Apple as well as internet searches shifting to mobile phones. Revenue rose 24% to $32.32 billion, topping consensus. The adjusted EPS excluded the impact of tax reform, which resulted in additional expense of $9.9 billion.Amazon's Jeff Bezos, JPMorgan's Jamie Dimon and Berkshire's Warren Buffett said the new nonprofit company is aimed at reducing costs for their employees. But if they are successful with their own firms, the thinking is that they would expand the services to corporate America. Health insurers and pharmacy benefit managers sold off.

Pure-play PBM Express Scripts (ESRX) retreated 5.9%.PayPal (PYPL) reported strong earnings and in-line guidance, while former parent eBay (EBAY) reported in-line Q4 earnings but stronger-than-expected gross merchandise volume. But the real news was that eBay stunned Wall Street with the news that it will replace PayPal in 2020 and handle payments on its own site via a partnership with Adyen. The move will add a revenue stream. Shares of eBay soared nearly 14% on Thursday. PayPal lost 10.4% for the week, closing below a buy point and its 50-day line.The Chinese e-commerce giant's revenue soared 56% to $12.8 billion, the best gain in at least 15 quarters and beating views. Earnings per U.S. share climbed 25%, but slightly missed forecasts. Alibaba will buy a 33% stake in Ant Financial, a former unit that runs payments service Alipay. That replaces a deal in which Alibaba got 37.5% of Ant Financial's pretax profit. Alibaba will provide some intellectual property but not cash. The move clears hurdles for a possible Ant Financial IPO. Alibaba shares 8.7% for the week, tumbling below a recent buy point.The U.S. added 200,000 jobs in January, better than expected. Average hourly wages surged 2.9% vs. a year earlier, far above views and the best since 2009. The ISM manufacturing index continued to point to raid employment gains. While fast growth and wage gains are good news, they could spur the Federal Reserve to raise rates more aggressively this year.The software leader reported adjusted earnings per share of 96 cents, up 20% year over year, on sales of $28.9 billion, up 12%, for its fiscal second quarter. Analysts expected 86 cents and $28.4 billion. Microsoft got a lift from its cloud computing businesses, including Azure, Office 365 and Dynamics. For the current quarter, Microsoft guided to earnings per share of 83 cents on sales of $25.6 billion, above views.

AMD beat Wall Street's targets for the December quarter and guided estimates higher for the current quarter. Broadcom gave preliminary sales and earnings guidance for its fiscal first quarter that topped views. Qorvo rocketed after disclosing a big contract win with major customer Apple (AAPL) for its next-generation iPhone. Qorvo delivered better-than-expected results for its fiscal Q3, but guided well below Wall Street's targets for the current quarter.Boeing (BA) reported EPS of $4.80 a share, or $3.06 excluding a $1.74 per-share benefit from tax cuts. Either way, Boeing beat analyst views for $2.91. Revenue climbed 9% to $25.37 billion, also topping views. Boeing also guided 2018 EPS and revenue forecasts higher. Tax cuts will spur more investment and makes the case for new midmarket jet more compelling. Boeing also got a $6.6 billion missile defense contract from the Pentagon. UPS (UPS) ordered 14 new 747 jets, giving the venerable jumbo jet a new lifeline. Meanwhile, Lockheed Martin (LMT) EPS jumped 32% to $4.30 while revenue rose 10% to $15.1 billion.

141,VRTX,"Stocks opened lower Thursday as overseas markets lost ground and an inflation gauge jumped unexpectedly, while a barrage of earnings news fueled busy early trade.X The Dow Jones industrial average dug a 0.4% hole, as Nike (NKE) slipped to the bottom of the index, and Visa's (V) posted the only early gain of better than 1%. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.3%, with PayPal (PYPL), Tractor Supply (TSCO) and Vodafone (VOD) putting up the Nasdaq 100's largest opening declines.The S&P 500 dipped 0.2%, bolstered by Qorvo (QRVO), eBay (EBAY) and Vertex (VRTX).Now in the thick of earnings season, Microsoft (MSFT), Facebook (FB), Qualcomm (QCOM) and United Parcel Service (UPS) were among the many notable names reacting to quarter results early Thursday. Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon.com (AMZN) and Visa (V) are all set to report after today's closing bell.Visa led the Dow, up 1.3% ahead of its quarterly report, as Nike dived 1.7% in opening trade.Microsoft edged up 0.4%. Its cloud-computing business drove fourth-quarter results well ahead of analyst targets, the company reported late Wednesday. Shares are extended, up 10% since clearing a flat base in December.S&P 500 component Qorvo spiked 11% as analysts upgraded the stock following its fiscal third-quarter report after Wednesday's close. The supplier of chips for Apple's iPhone is trading just below an 81.30 buy point in a cup base, and up almost 18% so far this week.Facebook traded 2% higher, recovered from an after hours dip late Thursday after the social media giant reported better-than-forecast results for the fourth quarter, but raised concerns about the effect from changes to its News Feed. Shares are still in their buy range, above a 184.35 buy point.EBay and Nokia each vaulted more than 12% as investors responded to their quarterly performances. Information technology service firm NIC (EGOV) posted one the session's most perilous early declines, down 17%.PayPal fell 8% at the open. EBay announced during its earnings report late Wednesday that it would curtail its use of PayPal in 2020, and switch to digital payments provider Ayden. The loss sent shares back below the buy point of a flat base they had cleared in early January, but stopped short before cutting the stock's 10-week moving average.Alibaba Group Holdings (BABA) gave up almost 6% after a mixed fiscal third-quarter report. The China-based e-commerce leader also announced it had retaken a 33% share in ANT Financial, the unit it had spun off in 2011. The loss erased the stock's gain above a 191.85 buy point from a flat base from which it had broken out on Jan. 23.Economic news ahead of Friday payrolls report showed layoffs announced by U.S. employers surged 38% month-over-month in January to 44,653, according to the Job Cuts Report from Challenger, Gray & Christmas.

Retailers led January's payrolls reductions, laying off 15,378 workers — almost 32% fewer cuts than the 22,491 layoffs announced in January last year.First-time unemployment claims were roughly even, at 231,000, in the week ended Jan. 27, the Labor Department said. That compared with 233,000 claims in the prior week, below projections for an uptick to 235,000 new applications.The Labor Department's preliminary estimate on fourth-quarter productivity showed a 0.1% dip, far below the monster 2.7% surge in the third quarter as well as consensus estimates for a 1.1% increase. Unit labor costs popped 2%, vs. a 0.2% decline in the third quarter and estimates for a 0.9% increase — adding to inflation fears raised by the Fed on Wednesday.The dollar reversed some of its recent gains vs. the yen, buoyed by the wary view toward inflation conveyed in Wednesday's policy announcement from the Federal Reserve. Stocks in Japan responded, sending Tokyo's Nikkei 225 to a muscular rebound, up 1.7%, and ending the six-day decline that had followed currency comments from U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in Davos, Switzerland, last week.China's markets continued lower, with the Shanghai Composite down 1% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng index taking a 0.8% loss.In Europe, markets turned lower in afternoon trade. The CAC-40 in Paris gave up early gains and dropped 0.4%, while Frankfurt's DAX dived 1.3% and the FTSE 100 in London posted a 0.5% decline.Other Important Early Market News For Thursday:The Big Picture: Stocks Edge Up, Nasdaq Up 7.4% in January; Will Large Caps Keep Leading?PayPal Shares Plunge On eBay Contract Exit; Adyen Moves In For DealGood News For Apple Before Earnings; These 2 Tech Leaders Go On Wild Rides

142,VRTX,"Imagine editing one gene and curing a debilitating disease. Three small biotech companies with combined annual sales of less than $50 million — Crispr Therapeutics (CRSP), Intellia Therapeutics (NTLA) and Editas Medicine (EDIT) — say that soon could be a reality.X All three biotech stocks went public in 2016 to bet big on a simple premise: Altering specific genes can create curative medicines. An estimated 5,000 diseases could be cured by changing one targeted gene, says former Intellia Chief Executive Nessan Bermingham.The World Health Organization has a higher estimate for what are known as monogenic diseases and says it's actually north of 10,000.""People have been talking about (personalized medicine) for 20 years and yet we've never had a system to allow us to do it before,"" Bermingham told Investor's Business Daily before stepping down from his role on Dec. 31. ""And for the first time ever, we actually have a system to do it and that system would be based on your personalized genome.""That system is known as CRISPR, and it's where Crispr, Intellia and Editas are putting their chips. It's a cheaper and faster gene editing method and, according to Bermingham, the key to advancing personalized medicine. Some analysts think CRISPR technology could provide the platform for the next generation of giant biotech companies.CRISPR the technology — not to be confused with Crispr Therapeutics, the company — builds on a project that sequenced the human genome. The first map cost $2.7 billion and was completed in 2003.Since then, the cost to map an individual's genome has dropped precipitously and could come down to just hundreds of dollars in the next few years, Bermingham says. Large-data analytics also have a part to play in sifting through the genome.IBD'S TAKE: Biotech companies account for a large share of recent IPO stocks, yet investing in them before they have profits or sales can be risky. Learn to identify the best IPOs and how to trade them for potential big gains.  When the first human genome was mapped, investigators were ""absolutely horrified"" to find just 20,000 genes in the human body that code proteins, Bermingham says. That was down from estimates of 100,000. Essentially, these protein-coding genes serve as words in the genetic language.Investigators also found regions of DNA that were initially thought to have no purpose. These were controversially called ""junk DNA"" that does not code protein. But, as it turns out, these sequences do have a key purpose in regulating the expression of genes.All together, the better understanding of the human genome has allowed these biotech companies to utilize CRISPR, an acronym for the technology known as Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats.There is a caveat, however. In January, a paper published by bioRxiv said there may be evidence that human immune systems may fight off the major form of genome editing that uses an enzyme called Cas9, thus rendering the science ineffective. The paper, however, has yet to be peer reviewed.The process, developed at various universities, essentially uses specialized strands of DNA that act as molecular ""scissors."" Those scissors are capable of editing other DNA at specific points, and allow biotech companies to edit, add or remove faulty genes responsible for diseases.There are varying types of scissors. Crispr, Intellia and Editas are using the Cas9 CRISPR technology, ARK Invest analyst Manisha Samy told IBD. She estimates Cas9 can reach 70%-80% of the human genome. Developing new scissors can expand the reach into more genes and diseases, she says.Gene editing isn't new, she adds. Older techniques called TALENs and zinc finger nucleases have been around for some time. Notably, biotech company Bluebird Bio (BLUE) is using a variation of TALENs, and Sangamo Therapeutics (SGMO) is using a method of zinc finger nucleases.She likens CRISPR technology to a word processor.""We think CRISPR gene editing is analogous to a DNA word processor with two functions: find and delete,"" she said in a January 2017 report. ""In addition, scientists are working on a rudimentary paste function, allowing CRISPR to insert appropriate DNA code to repair mutations.""Older technologies used by biotech companies are more like old-fashioned typewriters, requiring actual cutting and pasting, she says. CRISPR technology is also cheaper and easier to use than TALENs and zinc fingers, says JMP Securities analyst Mike King.""What's so powerful about CRISPR is it's so easy to use,"" he told IBD. ""High school students are doing experiments in the biology lab to knock out genes. Zinc fingers takes a lot of talent and time. You have to fiddle with them a lot. The systems created under CRISPR are quite robust.""In January, bioRxiv — an online archive and distribution service for unpublished reports in the life sciences field — published a paper casting doubt on the durability of CRISPR gene therapy over time, suggesting the body could build an immunity to it. Analysts and biotech companies are not worried, however, saying either this is a nonissue or there's time for the science to catch up.Many companies working in CRISPR are doing so using the Cas9 enzyme, short for CRISPR associated protein 9. Cas9 is derived from two bacteria that cause infections in humans at high rates, meaning some immune systems could have developed immunities to them.Would CRISPR gene editing, using that enzyme, work in those patients?It depends, Crispr Therapeutics said in a follow-up email to IBD. It's important to note the lead investigator and writer on the bioRxiv paper was Matthew Porteus, a scientific founder and advisory board member for Crispr Therapeutics.When the gene editing is done ex vivo, or outside the body, the Cas9 enzyme is degraded and, therefore, essentially gone by the time the cells are reintroduced to the patient, Crispr told IBD.For in vivo applications, when gene editing is done inside the body, Crispr Therapeutics says it uses several approaches to ensure transient expression of the Cas9 enzyme. Because of that, ""we do not expect pre-existing immunity to Cas9 to cause any issues,"" the firm said.Ark's Samy also noted that other enzymes are in use. Editas is also using the Cpf1 enzyme. This enzyme is derived from other bacteria and could overcome some of the immunity challenges involving Cas9.Intellia told IBD in a follow-up email that in clinical testing, its delivery system for treatment in rodents and non-human primates has yet to falter. Further, Intellia notes it's using an advanced form of Cas9 and none of the donors had a pre-existing immunity in its study.The data are still early. Editas has done its own work in immune responses to CRISPR genome editing and will present a paper in the future, JMP's King said in a Jan. 8 note to clients. Management has indicated it found immune responses to be ""much lower"" than those reported in the other paper.""Immune responses are not uncommon,"" Samy said. ""Scientists have worked for decades on evading immune recognition. There are numerous workarounds that can be implemented to reduce any potential side effects with Cas9 and we have proved this in a number of other therapeutic modalities.""Among the biotech companies, Crispr Therapeutics is ahead of the competition from a regulatory standpoint. On Dec. 7, the firm submitted its first application for a clinical trial testing its gene therapy, known as CTX001, in a blood disorder known as beta thalassemia.The company is working with Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) in beta thalassemia, as well as sickle cell disease. The therapies are part of Crispr's ex vivo programs, where gene editing is done on cells outside the body before they are reintroduced to the patient. Crispr is also looking at in vivo therapies for the liver, muscles and lungs.According to a Crispr news release, the trial is set to begin in Europe in 2018 in adult patients. This is expected to be the first in-human trial of a gene editing treatment based on CRISPR technology. Crispr also plans to file an application to begin testing for CTX001 in treating sickle cell disease in the U.S. in 2018.Intellia also has in vivo and ex vivo programs in gene editing, and also is working in sickle cell disease. It's furthest along in a partnership with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) for a therapy to treat what's known as transthyretin amyloidosis, a condition characterized by the buildup of abnormal protein deposits throughout the body.Alnylam Pharmaceuticals (ALNY) and Ionis Pharmaceuticals (IONS) also are working separately to treat the disease using different methods called RNA interference and antisense technology, respectively.Meanwhile, Editas is working on an injected treatment for an inherited eye disease known as Leber congenital amaurosis, which is characterized by severe loss of vision at birth. It is also using gene editing in sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia.Intellia and Editas also are expected to start in-human trials in 2018, analysts say, though Intellia has not said when it will begin testing.Regulators are getting more comfortable with the idea of gene editing, Crispr Therapeutics President Sam Kulkarni told IBD. The benefit of gene editing — and potential trouble with it — is that it's meant to be a permanent fix. The biotech companies are working to ensure they hit a bull's-eye every time out.""We've shown you we can make this edit and it's done in a precise fashion using (targets the industry calls) molecular ZIP codes,"" he said. ""We eliminate edits happening outside places you want them to happen. And we manufacture these in a high-quality fashion, understanding the pharmacology.""Both Kulkarni and Intellia's Bermingham — who was succeeded by John Leonard, a former AbbVie (ABBV) executive — say there's room for all three big players in the group.Sizing the market is a challenge, ARK's Samy says. No matter how you slice it, the numbers are big and a lot will depend on which diseases companies target and how they set pricing.If CRISPR is able to address all monogenic diseases diagnosed each year, that's a $75 billion market globally, she says. Addressing all these diseases for people already living with diagnoses would be a $2 trillion market.""One product is not going to cure everything,"" she said. ""Whenever you're seeing volatility between these three main CRISPR companies, it doesn't really make sense because there's room for all of them and more when it comes to CRISPR.""Kulkarni says it's unlikely the market will remain at just three publicly traded biotech companies with CRISPR technology in the long run. The technology is just that remarkable.""Once in a lifetime may be a little bit of a stretch, maybe not,"" he said. ""But it's definitely a once in a generation type of advance in the field. The last time this kind of excitement happened in the biotech field was when antibodies were applied as therapeutic modalities. On the basis of that, technology companies like Genentech (now owned by Roche (RHHBY)) were created.""He added: ""Here we have the basis of a CRISPR platform to create the next big biotech giants.""RELATED:6 Top Biotech Companies In Innovation Earn Recognition In New AwardsWhy Bluebird's Downgrade Sent These Two Rivals SkyrocketingFind The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch NowMeet The 5 Best Brokers Overall For Every Investor Need

144,VRTX,"Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN), Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) are likely to beat fourth-quarter earnings estimates, an analyst predicted, but biotech guidance will be cautious despite the windfall of tax reform.X The fourth-quarter earnings reporting season kicks off next week with Dow's Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Novartis (NVS) weighing in Tuesday and Wednesday on the pharma side. Celgene (CELG) and Biogen (BIIB) are on deck early Thursday with AbbVie (ABBV) trailing on Friday.Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges expects cautious predictions at the beginning of 2018, noting the example of Celgene's pre-announcement earlier this month. Uncertainties in payer dynamics, competition and U.S. drug access are likely to play into forecasts.""All these factors, along with an imminent return to a more challenging political environment, suggest that management teams will be more than typically cautious in the guidance that they first provide to the financial community on their earnings calls,"" he said in a note to clients.For the fourth quarter, Porges calls for Vertex's cystic fibrosis drugs Orkambi and Kalydeco, Gilead's hepatitis C and HIV drugs, and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' (REGN) Eylea and Dupixent — the latter two eye disease and eczema treatments, respectively — to surprise to the upside.IBD'S TAKE: Biotechs suffered in the third quarter as high profile drugs missed expectations and smaller players took headlines by beating views. Head to the Industry Snapshot for more on what happened in the prior quarter and whether history is expected to repeat itself.But he sees older drugs from Amgen (AMGN), including psoriasis and arthritis med Enbrel, as at risk of disappointing investors. Biogen's multiple sclerosis drugs Avonex and Plegridy, and AbbVie's cancer med Imbruvica could also disappoint, he said.Needham analyst Alan Carr sees investors focusing on mergers on the fourth-quarter calls and throughout 2018. This week, rumors emerged that Celgene could be considering a takeover of Juno Therapeutics (JUNO), and Biogen could be considering putting in a bid on Acorda Therapeutics (ACOR).""We continue to believe pharma has a bias towards de-risked assets that are on the market or in some cases still under regulatory review,"" he wrote in a note to clients.In the first half of 2018, he expects the Food and Drug Administration to approve Vertex's cystic fibrosis regimen of Kalydeco and tezacaftor as well as an HIV combination from Gilead. AbbVie and Neurocrine Biosciences (NBIX) could also get the OK for a drug to treat severe menstrual pain.Alnylam Pharmaceuticals (ALNY) is also likely to grab approval for patisiran, a drug to treat a condition in which abnormal protein deposits throughout the body can cause systemic problems.

It also guided to a 9% tax rate in 2018 and a tax rate around 13% in the near-term.It also follows announcements last week that Celgene would acquire Juno Therapeutics (JUNO) and Sanofi (SNY) would acquire Biogen (BIIB) spinoff Bioverativ (BIVV). Today, Sanofi also said it will buy Ablynx (ABLX).If AbbVie does seek an acquisition, it will likely be in neuroscience, early-stage immuno-oncology or solid tumor medicine, Porges said. AbbVie could seek deals to build onto or complement its early-stage Alzheimer's disease pipeline ahead of a key readout in 2019.So far, though, AbbVie is playing its cards close to its vest. The firm doesn't seem inclined to make ""large or disruptive"" transactions, Porges said. Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan noted the firm is constantly looking at assets but believes it already has a strong pipeline.Further, ""they do not have a burning platform where they need to acquire an asset,"" he said. ""If there isn't a compelling need and the company is dealing with many other things, it probably is not the best time to do mergers and acquisitions.""IBD'S TAKE: Celgene and AbbVie have already reported their fourth-quarter earnings, but a slew of biopharmas are still slated to issue their reports. Head to IBD Industry Themes for a closer look at what analysts expect from the biotech and drugs groups.That puts AbbVie in a slightly different boat from Gilead and Celgene. Gilead acquired Kite Pharma in 2017 amid slowing hepatitis C drug sales. Last week, Celgene said it would buy Juno four years before it begins losing exclusivity on cancer drug Revlimid.Divan's comments follow a conversation with AbbVie's management post fourth-quarter earnings. Analysts suggested the lower-than-expected 9% tax rate means AbbVie will have extra cash on hand with which it could engage in mergers and acquisitions. AbbVie says it's looking at earlier-stage and single assets to build out its pipeline.""If they find anything in the 2019 or 2020 timeframe, even before the (neuroscience) readouts, they would not necessarily feel the need to wait,"" Divan said in a note to clients.Divan boosted his price target on AbbVie to 135 from 98 and kept his neutral rating. Porges also upped his price target to 127 from 105, though he downgraded AbbVie to a market perform rating from outperform.""At current valuations, we prefer Celgene to AbbVie among the larger cap names in our coverage,"" he said. ""Growth names such as Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX), Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) continue to offer more upside, in our view, than AbbVie.""By the closing bell on the stock market today, AbbVie dipped a fraction to 122.31.RELATED:Celgene Reverses In Fourth Quarter As Otezla Sales ReboundCould Sanofi's Ablynx Deal Spur A Biopharma Buying Spree?Will Biotech's Merger 'Spigot' Turn On After Juno, Bioverativ?

174,VRTX,"Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) and Galapagos (GLPG) stocks diverged Friday as one analyst suggested that while Galapagos has an interesting molecular formula, it may not have a viable cystic fibrosis drug on its hands.XBy the closing bell on the stock market today, Vertex popped 3.5% to finish at 149.97, as Galapagos fell 2.7%, to close at 97.09. The biotechs made presentations Friday during the North American Cystic Fibrosis Conference in Indianapolis.""Galapagos has well-researched molecules that have intriguing activity in a variety of laboratory systems and molecular models for cystic fibrosis, but so far it is difficult to know if these molecules will actually make viable drugs,"" Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges said in a note to clients.Both biotechs are working on triple-pill combinations to treat the genetic lung condition. Analysts mostly estimate Galapagos is several years behind Vertex, which already has four potential triple-pill combinations in midstage testing.To catch up, Galapagos appears to be compressing and ""attempting to outright skip over"" many of the traditional aspects of clinical testing. That has raised some questions for investors, Porges said.""Given their lack of progress with their combinations in the U.S., we don't foresee the sort of rapid development timeline for Galapagos' combinations in the U.S. that they are proposing and planning for Europe,"" he said.IBD'S TAKE: At one point, Vertex looked like it was going to go bust as it worked to pivot to cystic fibrosis after its hepatitis C drug tanked. Visit The New America for more on Vertex's transition and what's next.During its presentation, Galapagos indicated it plans to introduce molecules via single-drug and add-on studies first, and then advance into novel triple-combination trials very rapidly, Porges said. The goal is seemingly to avoid traditional Phase 2 trials.But the Food and Drug Administration hasn't endorsed that strategy.""This means that all the current and soon-to-start trials of the Galapagos combinations will be conducted only in Europe,"" he said.Still, Galapagos is aiming to advance their combination to Phase 3 testing in 2019. AbbVie (ABBV) acquired the rights to Galapagos' cystic fibrosis combination program in 2013. Under the terms of the deal, AbbVie has to fund and execute the Phase 3 trials.AbbVie would likely prefer a more traditional and complete path to expensive Phase 3 testing, he said. Before that, AbbVie will have to decide whether to opt in or out of the deal.""Should AbbVie discontinue, or delay a decision about going forward, this would be viewed negatively for Galapagos and positively for Vertex,"" he said. ""Such a decision doesn't seem imminent, which is fortunate for Galapagos, but will make for challenging times for Galapagos if AbbVie opts out, or doesn't advance any of the combinations.""Porges has an outperform rating and 179 price target on Vertex stock.RELATED:Three Biotech Firms Top Third-Quarter Views — But Only One PopsIonis Rebounds After Beating Alnylam To Drug Application In EuropeNeurocrine, Exelixis, Juno Stocks Rocket After Crushing Views

175,VRTX,"The Trump administration's chances of pushing through tax reform legislation are improving and will pressure so-called FANG stocks — Facebook (FB), Amazon.com (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) — and other momentum stocks with high hedge fund ownership, says JPMorgan.X ""For managers overweight growth/momentum, taking a defensive approach to tax reform appears prudent,"" said the JPMorgan report published Thursday. ""While passage of tax reform may provide mid-single digit upside to the S&P 500, we also estimate that equity allocations for most investor types are near historical highs, potentially leaving them less willing to increase allocations to U.S. equities further. Thus, passage of tax reform is likely to result in style implications for equities (i.e. value vs. growth).""JPMorgan recommends ""protective strategies"" for high growth/momentum stocks with high hedge fund ownership. They include: Facebook, Salesforce.com (CRM), Applied Materials (AMAT), Wynn Resorts (WYNN), Qorvo (QRVO), Marriott International (MAR), Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) and Autodesk (ADSK).Also on the list are: Micron (MU), Align Technology (ALGN), Netflix, JD.com (JD), Activision-Blizzard (ATVI), Red Hat (RHT), Lam Research (LRCX), Mercadolibre (MELI,) PayPal Holdings (PYPL) and Adobe Systems (ADBE).IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.Stocks rose early Thursday as investors eyed a pending tax reform vote in the U.S. Senate. After a technology sector sell-off on Wednesday, all of the FANG stocks traded higher, led by Netflix. Goldman Sachs led the Dow, continuing a rally in banks and financial stocks.""Passage of tax reform, or increasing speculation thereof, could cause a continued rotation out of growth/momentum,"" said JPMorgan. ""Our analysis suggests strong active manager performance is being driven by record-high stock dispersion, high exposure to growth/momentum, and a (skewing) of stock returns favoring a few select stocks (FANGs).""RELATED:Is This Trump-Bump Sector Gearing Up For Another Rally?Five Reasons Why JPMorgan, Citigroup, Other Financials Are Seizing Market LeadershipIn AI Technology Race, U.S. Chips May Be Ace-In-The-Hole Vs.

178,VRTX,"No franchise is safe in 2018 among large-cap biotechs, which are feeling pressure as the Food and Drug Administration speeds approvals for rival branded and generic medicines, analysts said Monday.X The theme is a continuation from 2017, Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges said in a note to clients.""Despite the near-record number of drug approvals, the large-cap biopharmaceutical sector fell out of a favor with investors, with no names more punished than those with concentrated product portfolios and looming branded or generic competitors,"" he said.Heading into 2018, management confidence is low as revenue trajectories for high-profile products face a slowdown courtesy of payers and competitive pressures. Porges doesn't see the uncertainty lifting in 2018 — and ""possibly not ever.""In 2017, competitive pressures slugged the likes of Celgene (CELG) and Gilead Sciences (GILD). Celgene is feeling the pain in its inflammation unit amid mounting competition from Eli Lilly (LLY) and Novartis (NVS), as Gilead sees a rival for its hepatitis C drug sales in AbbVie (ABBV).Early next year, Porges expects guidance from the lion's share of large-cap biotechs to be conservative. The most stock-moving guidance will come from Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) and Gilead, he predicted.Alexion is working on a drug dubbed ALXN1210 to treat a pair of rare blood diseases. It's also undergoing a restructuring. Meanwhile, Gilead's hepatitis C franchise will again come under the microscope even as it attempts to pivot further into HIV with its drug bictegravir.""We believe there is $16 per share of value in Gilead's stock for hepatitis C, and the stock price could move up or down 5% if hepatitis C revenue guidance meaningfully differs from the consensus $5.5 billion to $6 billion estimate,"" Porges said.IBD'S TAKE: Small-cap biotechs performed well in the third quarter, but large-caps suffered mounting competitive concerns. See how that translated in the stock prices by visiting the Industry Snapshot.He noted AbbVie's plans for hepatitis C products are likely to hurt Gilead stock. AbbVie recently launched Mavyret to treat all six genotypes of hepatitis C. AbbVie will likely provide guidance on its fourth-quarter call ahead of Gilead.Porges expects 2018 sales outlooks from Celgene, Alexion, Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX), Gilead, Amgen (AMGN) and AbbVie to miss analyst estimates. Biogen (BIIB) could provide an outlook that encompasses analyst views, he said.Later in the year, the large-cap universe will face political pressure, Porges predicted.""By midyear the congressional midterm elections will be underway, and these campaigns are likely to renew the focus on pharmaceutical companies and their pricing policies,"" he said. ""We continue to favor stocks of companies that are structural demand growth stories, with products protected by commercial, scientific, clinical or legal barriers to entry.""For 2018, his top picks are Vertex and Alexion.Another Leerink analyst, Michael Schmidt, pegs Clovis Oncology (CLVS) and Puma Biotechnology (PBYI) as his top picks among small- and midsize biotechs focused on treating cancer.This group of stocks has outperformed the broader biotech market by 52% thus far in 2017, Schmidt wrote in a note to clients. This dynamic is set to continue in 2018 in a ""favorable regulatory environment"" and as large caps expand their portfolios via acquisitions.In 2018, Incyte (INCY), Seattle Generics (SGEN), Exelixis (EXEL), Clovis, Agios Pharmaceuticals (AGIO), Puma and Array Biopharma (ARRY) are set to launch key products. He counts nine in the group set to unveil pivotal trial results and pending regulatory decisions for a total of seven firms.Emerging technologies remain of interest. CAR-T therapy, which trains a patient's immune cells to fight cancer, and precision oncology had a strong 2017. But success in immuno-oncology combinations, cancer vaccines and certain antibodies has only been modest.""We think next-generation antibody-drug conjugates could be an underappreciated re-emerging area of interest in 2018, representing a clinically validated category but with significant room for upside,"" Schmidt said.Antibody-drug conjugates are antibodies linked to cell-killing agents. The antibody binds to specific marks at the surface of a cancer cell. ImmunoGen (IMGN), Mersana Therapeutics (MRSN) and Seattle are working in this area with the latter the furthest along, he said.RELATED:Why Big Pharma And Biotech Companies Are Girding For A Pricing 'Knife Fight'Teva's Restructuring Plan: Another Case Of Been Here, Done That?Generic Drug Makers Face Pricing Issues That Other Pharmas Don't

Biogen is a leader in multiple sclerosis drugs and it has a new hit with Spinraza, the only spinal muscular atrophy drug on the market. But investors are also bullish on the prospects for aducanumab, which has indicated in early testing that it can reduce cognitive decline in early Alzheimer's patients.Biogen shares rose 1% before the market open on Tuesday. On Monday, the stock fell 2.8% to 328.55 in Monday's stock market trading, their third straight decline, and closed just above the 5% buy zone from a 312.50 entry initially cleared at the end of August.IBD'S TAKE: Buying or holding a stock can be risky heading into an earnings report. Here's an earnings options strategy that can help you cash in on post-earnings stock gains, while minimizing the risk from a weak quarter.Amgen, Vertex and Gilead Sciences fell below their 50-day moving averages on Monday. Amgen closed below an old 182.70 buy point for the first time since its Sept. 11 breakout. Amgen, Vertex and Gilead are in new flat bases.Vertex busted out in July on promising data on a new cystic fibrosis drug. Gilead Sciences is best known for its HIV/AIDS and hepatitis C drugs, but last week won FDA approval for its CAR-T drug to treat an aggressive form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The drug, Yescarta, comes from Gilead's recent acquisition of Kite Pharma.Gilead earnings are expected to fall 24% to $2.08, as hepatitis C drug sales tumble. Amgen EPS is seen up 2% to $3.09. Vertex earnings are expected to go vertical, surging 131% to 37 cents.Celgene shares rose 0.9% on Monday, but that's after tumbling 10.8% on Friday. Celgene scrapped late-stage trials on a Crohn's disease treatment. Wall Street forecasts a 19% EPS gain to $1.88.Alexion retreated 2.75% on Monday, undercutting the low of its short flat base. Alexion dropped below its 50-day moving average on Friday.Alexion earnings are expected to rise 8% to $1.33.One popular way to avoid stock-specific risks in biotech is via ETFs.

194,VRTX,"Biotechs Amgen (AMGN), Sarepta Therapeutics (SRPT) and Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) topped third-quarter estimates late Wednesday and boosted their 2017 guidance but not all met with good fortune in after-hours trading.XIn late trading on the stock market today, Amgen sank another 2.6% after closing down 1.6%, at 177.50. But Sarepta defied its deficit at the close of 1.2%, at 48.36, to rise 4.1% after the closing bell. Vertex concluded the trading day down 2.9%, at 146.80, and fell another 2.6% after hours.Amgen wrapped its third quarter with adjusted income of $3.27 per share on $5.77 billion in sales. Earnings rose 8% while revenue dipped 1%. Both metrics, though, topped the consensus of analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research for adjusted profit of $3.09 a share on $5.74 billion in sales.Sales of cancer drug Blincyto had a yearly sales gain of 79% to $52 million. Revenue from Prolia, a treatment to increase bone mass, followed distantly, growing 22% to $464 million. But sales of Enbrel, an immunosuppressant and Amgen's biggest drug, dipped 6% to $1.36 billion.IBD'S TAKE: Biotech and drug stocks could be in trouble if President Donald Trump enacts an executive order to tug down on drug prices, an action a Washington, D.C.-based expert says could happen ""any day.""

Amgen doesn't expect an impact on product supply from its manufacturing facility in Puerto Rico.The firm also boosted the low end of its 2017 sales guidance to $22.7 billion to $23 billion, bracketing analyst views for $22.81 billion. For the year, it now expects to bring in adjusted profit of $12.50-$12.70 per share, up from earlier views for $12.15-$12.65, and topping the consensus for $12.51.Sarepta crushed third-quarter expectations with adjusted losses of 20 cents on $46 million in sales vs. the year-earlier period in which it reported adjusted losses of 95 cents a share and no revenue. The consensus had modeled an 86-cent adjusted loss per share on $39 million in sales.The firm has one approved drug called Exondys 51, a treatment for Duchenne muscular dystrophy in some patients with a specific genetic mutation.""We are proud that Exondys 51 is on track to be one of the most successful ultrarare disease launches in history, but we are prouder still that Exondys 51 performance and the advancement of our pipeline in third quarter furthered our mission to improve the lives of children with Duchenne muscular dystrophy,"" Chief Executive Douglas Ingram said in a statement.For the third quarter running, Sarepta boosted its guidance. It now sees 2017 sales of $150 million to $155 million, which smashed the consensus view for $135 million. Sarepta didn't give adjusted loss expectations. Analysts model adjusted losses of $3.57 per share for the year.Despite an across-the-board, third-quarter beat, Vertex stock toppled late Wednesday after it said two cystic fibrosis studies failed. In one case, the failure wasn't a surprise considering the study closed weeks ago and would have been reported if the results were positive, RBC analyst Brian Abrahams said.The other failure was ""a bit more surprising,"" he said.Still, the quarterly results were positive, he said. Vertex delivered a strong beat-and-raise on sales of cystic fibrosis drugs Kalydeco and Orkambi. Kalydeco printed $213 million in sales, topping views for $196 million. Orkambi's $336 million in revenue beat the consensus' $321 million expectations.""While the scientific rationale for adding a corrector in a Kalydeco-sensitive population was not quite as clear, earlier data had looked promising,"" he said. ""However, we note that success of this study would not have expanded the market substantially, as these patients are already receiving Kalydeco.""Total sales grew 39.7% to $578.17 million, and topped the consensus for $518 million.

201,VRTX,"Jeffrey Leiden's office shelves are plastered with all the accoutrements you'd expect from the chief executive of a $39 billion biotech. But from the awards, letters of accommodation and inevitable family photos, emerges a theme.Gratitude.Leiden's Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) currently aims to treat 31,000 cystic fibrosis patients across the globe. Cystic fibrosis is a progressive, genetic lung condition and those who survive into adulthood generally don't live past the age of 38, according to most estimates.XIn 2012, Vertex set out to change that and the success it's seen with two medicines — soon to be three — on the market have generated the 50 to 100 pieces of mail plastered to Leiden's shelves. They're letters of thanks from graduates and newlyweds.""We get about 50 (letters and emails) a week from patients and families thanking us for what we do,"" Leiden told Investor's Business Daily. ""We know all these patients. Most of them are kids and teenagers and we watch them grow up. It's like being part of a family. Not a company.""Vertex wasn't always a cystic fibrosis play. In earlier days, it was focused on treating hepatitis C and launched a drug known as Incivek in 2011. Then Gilead Sciences (GILD) launched its drug, Sovaldi. That launch was one of the most successful in history. It also nearly put Vertex out of business.Though Incivek became a blockbuster drug shortly after its launch, Vertex pulled it from the market in 2014 as demand withered. Leiden describes that time as one of ""crisis"" for the company.""We were in the middle of a crisis,"" he said. ""We had gone from being a hepatitis C company with a billion-dollar drug for literally one year to essentially zero revenue. And there are very few companies that can, frankly, survive that kind of crisis simply because it's so hard to pivot to a new area or drug.""But for 13 years, a division of the company in San Diego had been quietly working in the cystic fibrosis arena. The indication fit in with Leiden's strategy: investing in scientific innovation to create transformative medicines for serious diseases with large unmet medical needs in specialty areas.Vertex's specialty focus allows it to keep its sales and marketing forces slim which, in turn, allows it to reinvest nearly nine in 10 dollars of its revenue back into research and development. It sells cystic fibrosis drugs in the U.S. with a sales force of fewer than 20, Leiden said.Fast forward to 2017. Vertex has two drugs on the market — Kalydeco and Orkambi. In the second quarter, sales of Kalydeco, its first approved cystic fibrosis drug, grew 5% year over year to $190 million and Orkambi rocketed 32% to $324 million.Year to date, Vertex stock has more than doubled, rising 108%. Shares began forming a cup with handle and a 163.74 buy point in late July. Meanwhile, the broader biotech industry group has risen 28% and is ranked eighth out of 197 groups tracked, up from No. 20 just 13 weeks ago.Shares of Vertex dipped 0.5% to close at 151.26 on Friday.Vertex is a rarity among biotechs, in a way. Its pipeline is almost solely in cystic fibrosis. Of 13 drugs in its pipeline not already licensed out to bigger pharmaceuticals, 11 are in cystic fibrosis. Leiden acknowledges the risk from a portfolio standpoint.But some products simply don't make sense for Vertex, he said. Vertex has farmed out drugs in flu and cancer to Dow's Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Merck KGaA because the enormous sales contingent it would take to sell drugs in those indications would take away from reinvesting in science.Reinvesting in science has allowed Vertex to do something else unique. Whereas medicines from other firms target the symptoms of cystic fibrosis, Vertex is working to correct the genetic underlying causes of the disease to, eventually, prevent infants diagnosed with it from ever fully developing it.The underlying science focuses on about 200 genetic mutations that can be divided into four ""buckets,"" Leiden said. Kalydeco can treat 10% of patients. Orkambi, a combination of Kalydeco and a drug known as lumacaftor, can treat another 50%. Eventually, though, Vertex plans to treat 90% of patients.Getting to that third ""bucket"" of patients, though, will require a three-pronged treatment strategy. Already, the ""backbone"" for that triple is being considered for approval in the U.S. and Europe: A combination of Kalydeco and a drug called tezacaftor. That looks likely to be approved in February 2018.On top of Kalydeco/tezacaftor, Vertex is adding a ""next-generation corrector,"" a drug that can fix other abnormalities in genes to treat another 30% of patients. Vertex has strong Phase 1 data for three next-generation correctors in combination with Kalydeco/tezacaftor, and a fourth ready to read out soon.The eventual goal is to decide which of the four possible triple-pill combinations will provide the most efficient treatment with few to no side effects. After that, Vertex plans to use gene editing to treat the last 10% of cystic fibrosis patients for whom traditional small molecule medicines won't work.Leiden won't comment on when he expect a triple-pill to get approval. He sees pivotal trials beginning next year. Most analysts take that to mean the U.S. Food and Drug Administration could approve a triple-pill from Vertex in 2019-20.Vertex's goal with the triple is to prevent infants, less than 1 year of age, from developing cystic fibrosis as it's known today. In adults who already have lung damage, Kalydeco has been shown to improve lung function within two weeks and, over time, slow the rate of decline in lung function.IBD'S TAKE: Vertex is among several leaders nearing a buy zone. Head to IBD's list, Stocks Near A Buy Zone, for other near-term opportunities including an entertainment stock and a financial services play.""Rather than declining at 1%-2% per year, they decline at 0.75% per year in lung function,"" Leiden said. ""And while that may not sound that significant, it's sort of like compounded interest. Take that over a lifetime and it makes an enormous difference in both their survival and their quality of life.""The quality of life improvement is huge, Leiden said.""They used to go to the hospital four to five times per year. Now it's zero to one time per year,"" he said. ""They used to be on a transplant list. Now they're not a transplant list. They used to be able to walk one block. Now they can walk miles. It's not just their longevity but their quality of life.""Galapagos (GLPG) and AbbVie (ABBV) have teamed up to follow in Vertex's steps, but both Leiden and JMP Securities analyst Liisa Bayko are doubtful the duo can catch up. To get FDA approval for a triple-pill combo, they must show strong data for each component first.Bayko estimates Galapagos is several years behind and even if it does make it to market, its triple-pill would have to have outstanding efficiency to persuade Vertex's patients to switch to a new medicine.""Vertex has done a good job at continually improving on its meds,"" she told IBD. ""They keep moving the bar higher. They make it challenging for people to want to go on a drug that will be just as good as Vertex's. Why would you want to do that if you can just get on Vertex's drug?""Some are more bearish, though. Jefferies analyst Michael Yee sees Galapagos eventually getting 20% of the cystic fibrosis market. Still, he notes Vertex has created a strong setup for itself with making barriers to entering the market high and delivering strong medicines.He, like others, questions what Vertex will do after its cystic fibrosis well runs dry. Leiden acknowledges the cystic fibrosis journey is nearing an end but says Vertex has plans to shift into other rare diseases like sickle cell, a genetic lung/liver condition and a deadly nerve disorder.""Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (a lung/liver condition) looks a lot like cystic fibrosis,"" Leiden said. ""We have the technology and we know how to go after it.""And as to the bears skeptical about Vertex's cystic fibrosis pipeline?""There's a group of analysts or investors out there that say, 'Well, it's really great they want to do that but we'll see if they're able to, I'm skeptical,'"" he said. ""The reason that's weird to me is we've already done it. We've proven we can do it and we've proven the model.""""I don't think it's a question anymore. I think we've demonstrated it works.""RELATED:Why The Biotech 'Catch-Up Rally' Could Add Another 15%-20%Celgene Breaks Out; These 2 Biotech Giants Close On Buy PointsTop Biotech Stock Near Buy Zone After FDA Drug Approval

He expects Vertex's triple-pill combination for cystic fibrosis to launch in late 2020.But Vertex stock fell 1.5% to 133.50 on the stock market today as some biotechs took a breather after a rapid 5-day run-up.Carr expects Vertex to identify at least one safe and effective triple-pill for cystic fibrosis.

Given Vertex's lead, competitors are likely to progress slowly, he said.Earlier this week, Galapagos said it's holding off trials of its own triple-pill to treat cystic fibrosis until the fourth quarter.

But as noted in the Big Picture column, the current outlook returned to ""Uptrend resumes"" on Monday after the S&P 500 hit all-time new highs.Among IBD's 197 industry groups the big winners have been solar, biotech, generic drug, educational software, data storage and desktop software, with weekly gains of 6% or more.In contrast, amid the fast slide in crude oil futures (currently at $42.97, but this week making a bear-market-level correction from its 52-week high around $54.45), oil drilling, field services and oil machinery as well as apparel retail and Western bank stocks have paced the downside for the week, all down 3% or more since last Friday.In the Dow industrials, commodities-driven names continue to drag on the blue-chip index in recent weeks, while banks have failed to regain their positive momentum. Three of the 30 stocks in the Dow Jones industrial average are down 1 point or more, including Home Depot (HD) and Goldman Sachs (GS).Home Depot fell more than 2% to 151.78 in heavy trading. The mega-cap DIY home-improvement retailer pierced its rising 50-day moving average for the second time in less than a month. Brick-and-mortar chains are falling in sympathy with Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY), which plummeted more than 12% to 29.47 in whale-like turnover after reporting dismal fiscal first-quarter results (EPS down 34%, revenue flat at $2.74 billion). The stock issued a key sell signal in late December when it gapped down hard and took out both its 50- and 200-day moving averages and failed to recover.Bed Bath is now down more than 27% year to date.Vertex, however, is up more than 79% since Jan. 1. One reason is that the stock has shown the classic elements of a bottoming-base pattern. These patterns are especially bullish because they represent the opportunity to get into a potential new leader as it breaks out of an early stage base.In the bottoming base, a former leader goes on a deep dive, usually falling 40% to 50% from its high, often more. The bottoming base, like the one Apple (AAPL) formed in 2015 to 2016, will drag over a long time, frustrating those disgruntled holders who eventually ditch their shares.In Vertex's case, the stock dived more than 50% from 143.45 to a low of 71.46. But as seen in good first-stage bases, Vertex plowed back above its 10-week and 40-week moving averages at the start of this year. Watch for upside resistance near 140, which in turn could help generate a follow-on entry.Through the success of its investments in new molecules and biotechnology, Vertex has completely turned its profit picture around. It lost money in 2013, 2014 and 2015, then earned 85 cents a share last year. The Street sees profit vaulting 95% this year to $1.66 a share and another 88% to $3.12 the next.Vertex grew its revenue 65% to $1.7 billion in 2016. Analysts expect revenue to climb 30% this year to $2.21 billion.As seen in IBD Stock Checkup, Vertex now sports a terrific 98 Composite Rating on a scale of 1 to 99, reflecting the recent strong increases in earnings and sales and the stock's rising relative price strength. Plus, Vertex's biomedical/biotech group now ranks an excellent 19th out of 197 industry groups in terms of six-month relative price performance.RELATED:How Can You Spot Major Stock Market Tops?

216,VRTX,"A ""catch-up rally"" in the biotech sector could tack on another 15%-20% to some stocks with Celgene (CELG), Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) leading the charge, an analyst said this week.XYear-to-date, the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF (IBB) is up 26%. Over the same time, the SPDR S&P Biotech ETF (XBI) is up 43%. Both are currently in buy zones. Despite this strong performance, biotech multiples are only just above their historical all-time troughs, Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges says.But a recovery could be underway. Large-cap biotech stocks are up 15%-20% since April 1 and beat the market ""handily"" in the second quarter.Still, biotechs continue trading at a significant discount to their pharma and medtech brethren, Porges said in a note to clients. Since 2014, the 35% and 15% premiums biotechs have enjoyed on pharma and medtech, respectively, have eroded and reversed.Porges is banking on a return on sentiment to the biotech sector.""Compared to where the revenue multiple for the group was in 2015, there is still an additional 15%-20% upside, should sentiment about the sector return to prior levels,"" he said.IBD'S TAKE: One industry observer says September could be a ""make or break"" month for the biotech sector based on a number of upcoming investor and health care conferences as well as expectations for nearly a dozen trial readouts. Who could excel — or be facing a pitfall? Head to IBD Industry Themes for a closer look.Recovery is already underway. In late August, Gilead Sciences (GILD) said it would pay $11.9 billion to acquire cancer play Kite Pharma (KITE). Days later, rival Novartis won approval for a key treatment, setting the stage for a key drug from Kite to be approved in November.Since that announcement, IBD's 446-company Biotech industry group has climbed 8.3% on what Porges calls a ""catch-up rally.""""To a significant extend, this is the rally that investors had been hoping and looking for, and it followed a surprisingly tepid July for the group, despite strong (second-quarter) operating results,"" Porges said.Consensus expectations in the third quarter are picking up, Porges said. Revenue views are modest, calling for an average 2%-3% growth in 2017 and 2018. And earnings per share forecasts are trending up for the first time this year.Porges is more bullish than the consensus. His top picks are outperform-rated Alexion, Celgene, Regeneron and Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX). Since January, even slow-growing large caps have delivered 10%-12% outperformance. Standouts among those include Regeneron, up 36%, and Vertex, up 116%.""Celgene has more pipeline optionality and has not appreciated as much lately as Alexion,"" he said. ""We are also recommending Regeneron and Vertex, although at their current valuations we see less upside in these names than for Celgene and Alexion.""RELATED:Alnylam Topples But Celgene, AstraZeneca Rise On Drug SetbacksTop Biotech Stock Near Buy Zone After FDA Drug ApprovalHow AbbVie Could Chip Away At Regeneron's Potential Blockbuster

217,VRTX,"When the stock market awards Ph.D.s, they are given for prudence, humility and disaster survival, not piggishness, hubris and denial.Disaster survival is the most important item because until investors have lived through a bear market, they have no idea how contagious panic can be.Fortunately, marketwide disasters are rare. Individual mistakes are more common, and the art of investing is all about surviving those mistakes and learning from them.The first mistake that new investors make is thinking the stock market is all about them. You buy a stock because of one brilliant reason or another, and the market eventually comes around to your brilliant idea, or so you believe.The stock market, though, isn't about you. The money you put into the stock market is pocket lint compared to the big funds that power and shape the market.So, experienced investors ask a set of preliminary questions before researching a stock further:A recent look at the Big Cap 20 found three stocks that are above their 50-day lines and had quality fund support.Electronic Arts (EA) is trading well above its 50-day moving average. The number of funds holding shares increased almost 5% over the past three quarters, while the overall stake fell 8%. But quality funds like the stock. Fidelity Magellan (FMAGX) bought shares in the most recently reported quarter. Fidelity Contrafund (FCNTX) increased its stake about 10%.PayPal (PYPL) is above its 50-day line. Fund participation and exposure are up from three quarters ago. Quality funds buying shares include these three A+ rated funds: T. Rowe Price Growth Stock Fund (PRGFX), Fidelity OTC Portfolio (FOCPX) and Contrafund.Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) is above its 50-day line and forming a base with a 167.95 buy point. Funds' overall stake declined over the past three quarters, but the number of funds increased. Quality funds buying shares include Contrafund and T. Rowe Price Growth.Passing these minimum tests aren't enough to qualify a stock for a buy, but the tests are a good way to cull for stocks that deserve a closer look.Going into Friday's session, the Big Cap 20 outperformed the S&P 500, 8.4% to 3.8% in the past six months. But be careful: In the past three months, the S&P 500 is up 1.7% vs. a decline of 1.3% for the Big Cap 20.RELATED:What's This? GM Stock Breaking Out?The Chip Stock You Probably Never Heard Of Is Back

218,VRTX,"Celgene (CELG) broke out Friday, joining Biogen (BIIB) and Bluebird Bio (BLUE), which entered buy zones on Thursday as biotechs broadly gapped up on a major merger in the cancer space.XIn afternoon trading on the stock market today, Celgene rose 0.45% to 139.38, clearing a 139.10 entry from a flat base. Bluebird continued to rise, soaring 4.8% to 130.85, after topping a buy point at 123.85 out of a cup on Thursday. Bluebird is now extended. Biogen climbed 1.4% to 321.01.Look for Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) to join the list of biotech breakouts as it nears an entry at 167.95 out of a flat base that began forming in late July. Shares lifted 1.1% to close at 162.24. Amgen (AMGN) advanced 0.5% to 178.71, potentially closing in on a buy point at 182.70.Biotech stocks have broadly rallied this week, popping nearly 8% on the announcement that Gilead Sciences (GILD) would acquire Kite Pharma (KITE) for $11.9 billion. In the aftermath, rivals Bluebird and Juno Therapeutics (JUNO) have enjoyed increases.IBD'S TAKE: Novartis (NVS) beat Kite to the finish line with what's known as a CAR-T drug, a therapy that teaches the immune system to identify and fight cancer. The approval opens a new sector in cancer treatment. Head to IBD Industry Themes for a deeper dive on the implications of Novartis' new treatment.The rally was less definitive Friday. Juno rose 1.6% to 41.92, while Gilead inched up to 83.75.

"
221,VRTX,"X The Nasdaq composite on Wednesday deflected yet another pounding in crude oil futures and related companies in the stock market, moving moderately higher as the Dow Jones industrial average harbored light losses late in Wall Street's regular session.The Nasdaq composite, up 0.7% at around 3:45 p.m. New York time, is stretching its year-to-date lead over the S&P 500 (down fractionally Wednesday) and the Dow Jones industrials (down 0.2%) despite showing five distribution days over the past 25 sessions. Volume on Wednesday is running higher on the NYSE vs. the same time Tuesday and lower on the Nasdaq.IBD's Big Picture column tracks heavy institutional selling in the form of distribution days, as witnessed in the Nasdaq on Tuesday (down 0.8%, higher volume than on Monday); a sudden rash of big declines in heavier volume than the prior session is enough to kill a bull market.The Nasdaq is up nearly 16% since Jan. 1, towering over the S&P 500's 8.8% advance. The Dow Jones industrial average is also lagging after a 13.4% gain in 2016, up 8.3% so far this year.Buying in the biotech and software sectors continued unabated in the aftermath of solid quarterly results from the likes of Adobe Systems (ADBE) (extended after a breakout at 111.19 in January) and Red Hat (RHT) (also extended from an 81.24 early entry in a long, choppy first-stage base).In the biotech group, which jumped to No. 31 among IBD's 197 industry groups in terms of six-month relative price performance, Celgene (CELG), Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) and Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) all pumped more than 5% higher in heavy turnover, showing the kind of action seen by iPhone giant Apple (AAPL) during its big runs in the mid-2000s and early part of the 2010s.Celgene has a market value of $103 billion, Regeneron is at $55 billion, and Vertex at $33 billion, vs. $760 billion for the iPhone, iPad and MacBook maker.When a stock breaks out, it tends to already be close to 52-week or all-time highs, already be trading above the 50- and 200-day moving averages, show a tremendous increase in share volume, and show strong finishes during its up sessions in prices.That's definitely the case with the three biomedical names mentioned above. All three are highly profitable developers of novel therapies to address difficult diseases and chronic conditions.Celgene ran 5% higher to 132.38 and powered past a 127.74 cup-base buy point in volume that is currently triple usual levels. The stock's 50-day average volume is 3.7 million shares. That cup could be seen as part of a long saucer base that goes all the way back to its July 2015 peak of 140.72.Notice on a weekly chart how Celgene had broken out of a three-month saucer pattern at 129.16 in July 2015, but did a hairpin curve lower and undercut the low of that base. Such action was a healthy shakeout of uncommitted investors and reset the base count back to zero. The Street sees first-quarter profit at the Summit, N.J., firm rising 24% to $1.78 a share. Celgene has posted EPS increases of 17%, 23%, 17%, 28%, 36% and 27% in the prior six quarters.Celgene sports an outstanding 98 Composite Rating and a 98 EPS Rating from IBD Stock Checkup. Watch to see if its 68 Relative Price Strength score improves in the near term.Regeneron (97 Composite Rating, 94 EPS Rating) is extended from a first-stage bottoming-base entry at 453.06 as shares have soared more than 13% so far this week to 521.71. However, notice on a weekly chart how the stock may run into some upside resistance in the 550 to 590 price level.Vertex (98 Composite, 79 EPS) surged 5% to 133.30 in fast turnover and is moving further past a recent handle on a long base, giving a solid entry at 122.06 (10 cents above the May 2 intraday high). In the handle, the stock sloped lower along the intraday lows and corrected no more than 7%.Back to Apple, the megacap tech is showing it still may have the wherewithal to recover from a sharp sell-off in the prior two weeks that triggered two key sell signals (read this Stock Market Today column to learn more about the exact sell rules).Apple gained around 0.6% to 145.59. Volume is light, but the stock is limiting its drop below the 50-day moving average to around 2%.Apple's Relative Price Strength Rating remains strong for now at 85, much better than the lowly 59 seen at the start of the year. However, keep in mind that the RS Rating covers 12 months' worth of price action vs. the rest of the market. Extra weight is given to the most recent three months' worth of action.There are plenty of reasons for long-term holders with a thick profit cushion to keep holding: 1) Apple is still well above its long-term 200-day moving average; 2) earnings picture is improving, with FY 2017 profit seen up 8% and FY 2018 profit up 18%; revenue growth in Apple's services unit is currently at solid double-digit pace; and 4) the likelihood of a major iPhone replacement cycle beginning in the fourth quarter of the current calendar year is very high.IBD's TAKE: One way to track emerging industry sector rotation within the market is to watch changes in the IBD 50. Right now, it's still chock-full of electronic, internet, computer and networking-related stocks. But will medicals and biotechs stage a larger presence. Go here every day to watch new leaders unfold, presenting wonderful new opportunities for investing profits.In the IBD 50, tech leaders Nvidia (NVDA), Coherent (COHR) and Applied Optoelectronics (AAOI) have all recovered nicely from price spills in the prior two weeks and remain in solid uptrends.RELATED:Investor's Corner: The Bottoming Base And How It Makes Money For Astute TradersInvestor's Corner II: Why Apple Formed A Bottoming Base In 2009Where Is The Market Headed?

222,VRTX,"Biotech Galapagos (GLPG) has a shot at making a dent in the cystic fibrosis market, but it will lag Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX), analysts said Wednesday after Galapagos pushed out a key trial.Analysts heading into Galapagos' research and development event Tuesday expected the firm to outline its timeline for a trial examining a three-pill series to treat cystic fibrosis, Janney analyst Debjit Chattopadhyay said in a note to clients.Instead, Galapagos is holding off its trials until the fourth quarter, pending regulatory guidance, Chattopadhyay said. Its closest rival, Vertex, plans to roll out triple-combo data in the third quarter, putting Galapagos more than a year behind.""On the positive side, the CF portfolio has multiple shots on goal and when the program does get the green light, Galapagos is planning to execute on multiple triple-combinations mimicking competitor Vertex,"" he said.In midmorning trading on the stock market today, Galapagos stock fell 1.9% to close at 77.35, while shares of Vertex jumped 6.7% to 134.83.Both firms are taking a triple-pill approach to treating cystic fibrosis, a disease of the lungs and digestive system. The triplet combinations are expected to be able to treat the genetic mutations tied to cystic fibrosis.IBD'S TAKE: Vertex stock is among four biotechs that should be on your watchlist now. Head to IBD Industry Themes for a closer look at Vertex and its strongest peers.Galapagos is working to narrow down seven potential contenders for the final triplet. But the delay in beginning its trials will likely mean Galapagos and partner AbbVie (ABBV) can't finalize their selections until 2019, Chattopadhyay said.Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan anticipated the delay given ""the relatively aggressive timelines the company had laid out previously."" Galapagos will first focus on the U.K. market before expanding its triplet to other countries, he said in a note to clients.According to a cystic fibrosis market, Galapagos' drug will need to show a 5% improvement over a non-drug placebo to be clinically meaningful in trials. She sees Galapagos grabbing an opening if it can prove its drug is equivalent to Vertex's.""She also sees a potential place for a new player on the market given the increased flexibility it will give patients and physicians in both terms of enrolling patients in new clinical trials and prescribing medicines once they are available commercially,"" Divan said.RELATED:Amgen, Gilead, Biogen Won't Lead The Biotech Boom — So Who Will?Vertex Rockets To 14-Month High On Cystic Fibrosis Drug ResultsGalapagos Cystic Fibrosis Drug Trials Vertex's 'Mega-Franchise': RBC

223,VRTX,"XStocks moved mildly lower Friday as the Nasdaq and Dow industrial each dipped 0.1% slip.Despite the slip, the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite is on pace for a 1.3% weekly gain, which comes after two consecutive weeks of relatively heavy losses. The Dow Jones industrial average showed a fractional loss for the week. The S&P 500 edged early Friday, defending a slim gain for the week.Among the Dow industrials, upside advancers were scarce. JPMorgan (JPM), Coca-Cola (KO) and Procter & Gamble (PG) clung to small gains of 0.3% each.On the downside, UnitedHealth Group (UNH) and Caterpillar (CAT) fell about 1.2%. Home Depot (HD) and Nike (NKE) declined 1% each.Within the S&P 500, EQT (EQT) and Align Technology (ALGN) paced the upside advancers, rising 1.8% and 1.7%, respectively.On the downside, Sysco Corp (SYS) dropped 3%, while Signet Jewelers (SIG) declined 1.7%. Harley Davidson (HOG) fell 2%.Among analyst actions, Restoration Hardware (RH) and Vertex (VRTX) received upgrades, causing a 5% for the retailer, but Vertex reversed 1.4% lower after early gains. Meanwhile, Piper Jaffray hiked its price target on Electronic Arts (EA) to 128 from 119, while JPMorgan initiated coverage on ServiceNow (NOW) with an overweight rating. Shares of EA and ServiceNow fell 0.1% each.On the earnings front, the bloodbath in brick and mortar stores continued in the stock market today after Bed Bath & Beyond's (BBBY) fiscal-Q1 results late Thursday. The retailer missed both top- and bottom-line estimates, resulting a 10% plunge in the stock price. Meanwhile, Finish Line's (FINL) Q1 revenues came in below the Street's estimates early Friday, but shares still advanced nearly 9%.Leading retailers Ollie's Bargain Outlet (OLLI) and Burlington Stores (BURL) haven't been spared from the sector carnage.

224,VRTX,"Apple (AAPL) continued to prove its rally from a bottoming base breakout in both October last year and in January may not be over yet, while biotechs and select chip stocks helped sustain the rebound in U.S. stocks Wednesday.The Nasdaq composite rallied more than 1.1% as of 2:30 p.m. ET, outperforming gains of 0.8% by the S&P 500 and 0.7% by the Dow Jones industrial average. Small caps are doing even better; the S&P SmallCap 600 gained 1.5%.X Turnover is running mildly lower vs. the same time Tuesday on both main exchanges. As noted in the latest Big Picture column, IBD downgraded the outlook on the market to ""Uptrend under pressure"" due to the sell-off on the Nasdaq in higher volume on Tuesday, known as distribution. A flurry of big distribution days is enough to halt a bull-market advance and even turn it into a bear market.Despite the lower turnover with less than two hours remaining in the stock market today, volume has been above average in all but one of the past 14 trading sessions for the Nasdaq.Banking stocks, meanwhile, resumed their advance following comments from Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen that appeared to indicate that another hike in short-term interest rates is in the cards for the rest of the year. The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury benchmark bond edged to around 2.23%, the highest since May 29. WTI crude oil futures added more than 1% to $44.78 a barrel. Silver futures rose 1.1% while gold edged fractionally higher to nearly $1,250 a troy ounce on the Comex.Apple, up nearly 1.5% to 145.85, is still holding on to a large portion of its gain since its Jan. 6-9 breakout from an excellent cup with handle. That base furnished a 118.12 buy point, 10 cents above the handle's high of 118.02. Apple then gained as much as 32.5% in the space of just four months.A further rebound by the iPhone giant would produce a new buy point if shares were to hop back above the 50-day moving average, currently near 149. Watch to see if the stock can retake that line.The Street sees Apple's sales rebounding 5% to $226.6 billion in the current fiscal year ending in September, following a rare 8% slide in FY 2016. Profit is expected to climb 8% to $8.94 a share. Apple holds a 1.8% annualized dividend yield.IBD's TAKE: While Apple is getting a boost on the top line in recent quarters due to strong demand for its services, some observers question whether Apple will need to make an acquisition to fuel continued revenue gains in that area of business and fulfill its goal of doubling that business by 2020. Read IBD's latest tech team coverage on this increasingly vital part of Apple's business model. As seen in IBD Stock Checkup, Apple's Relative Price Strength Rating continues to be positive at 84, meaning it's now beating 84% of all publicly traded companies in terms of 12-month relative price performance.Meanwhile, the biotech industry group is showing that it's not intending to backtrack from a leadership position in the stock market today. Some of this large industry group's biggest names, Celgene (CELG), Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) and Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX), are all behaving well and all three are trading above their respective 50-day moving averages, a sign of strength.Celgene, up more than 2% to 134.11, is wiping away losses from the prior two sessions. It broke out of a cup base with a 127.74 buy point last week. The 5% chase zone goes up to 134.12.Celgene sports a highest-possible 99 Composite Rating, a 98 for Earnings Per Share Rating, and an A+ for Accumulation/Distribution, which means that over the past 13 weeks, the stock has shown evidence of heavy share accumulation by mutual funds, banks, insurers, pensions and the like.Regeneron and Vertex are extended for now, but could provide follow-on buy points in the future. Watch for mild pullbacks to the 50-day or 10-week moving averages. Make sure that IBD's current outlook is showing either ""Confirmed uptrend"" or ""Uptrend under pressure,"" signifying the odds of making money on a breakout are higher.Vertex, up more than 1% to 131.05, is now extended more than 7% past a recent breakout past a 122.06 entry in a long, deep first-stage base, similar to that of a bottoming base pattern. In that base, Vertex crumbled 50.2%, creating a massive shakeout.In the chip sector, Broadcom (AVGO) and Nvidia (NVDA) are also showing leadership-quality gains. The former is also finding continued support along its 50-day line after a recent flat-base breakout at 227.85.Nvidia (98 Composite, 98 EPS) is extended from a May 10 breakout at 121.02. It has yet to challenge holders with a test of the 50-day moving average, which has been climbing sharply for more than six weeks.The Street sees fiscal second-quarter earnings jumping 68% to 69 cents a share, which is very impressive in light of the fact that Nvidia scored a 720% increase in adjusted EPS in the year-ago quarter, according to research by William O'Neil + Co.RELATED:How To Buy And When To Sell: The Latest In Investor's CornerWhen Did The Current Market Outlook Go To 'Uptrend Under Pressure'?

228,VRTX,"Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) investors will key in for more data on cystic fibrosis drugs late Thursday when the No. 6 biotech by market cap is set to report its first-quarter earnings.Analysts broadly expect Vertex to report triple-digit growth in adjusted profits and double-digit sales growth following a pair of trials last month that showed its two-drug pill for cystic fibrosis improved lung function.Shares rocketed to a 14-month high that day. Vertex said its combination of tezacaftor and ivacaftor significantly improved lung function in cystic fibrosis patients ages 12 and up with specific genetic mutations.Wall Street now is likely to look for more detail on that two-drug regimen and more perspective on when Vertex expects to have its three-pill regimen — also called a triplet — ready for cystic fibrosis.IBD'S TAKE: Vertex Pharmaceuticals stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 98 out of a best-possible 99, meaning it outperforms all but 2% of stocks in terms of key growth metrics. Head to IBD Data Stories for a closer look at the stock.Consensus: Analysts widely model Vertex as reporting 40 cents adjusted earnings per share, up 344% vs. the year-earlier period, and $510.55 million in sales, growing 28.6% on a year-over-year basis.Guidance: For the second quarter, analysts view Vertex guiding to $481.8 million in revenue and adjusted earnings of 36 cents a share, up a respective 11.7% and 50%.

229,VRTX,"Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN), Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) and Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) look likely to catch the next wave in biotech, an analyst said Friday, suggesting after two years of underperformance that the sector could be slated for a boom.X But it won't be ""value stocks"" like Gilead Sciences (GILD), Amgen (AMGN) and Biogen (BIIB) driving the boom, Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges told clients in a note.""These large caps drag down the performance of the indexes and (exchange traded funds), but the growth stocks already seem to be capturing sustained new investor interest,"" he said. ""Our advice to investors remains to identify and scrutinize evidence of competitive advantage and to look to management to maximize profitability of existing businesses first and foremost.""IBD's 431-company Biomed/Biotech industry group is up 10% for the first five months of 2017 after finishing 2016 down 25%. During the ""boom years"" of 2015 and 2014, the stocks tacked on 11% and 41% growth. The group closed down 0.9% on the stock market today.Such is the pattern in the biotech market, Porges says. Typical corrections run two to three quarters, followed by two to three years of sideways performance. Today, much of the excitement of mid-2015 has dissipated, leaving shares 40% below their long-term median relative multiples.Consensus expectations for biotech sales and profits have declined 14%-23% and 7%-12%, respectively, over the last two years.But the signs are getting better, Porges said. First-quarter results yielded ""a mixture of positive and negative results vs. (the) consensus, and prompted some additional negative revisions, but so far this quarter's estimates have been remarkably stable.""IBD'S TAKE: Regeneron stock outperformed a broad market plunge Thursday, topping a 456.06 saucer buy point. Head to IBD's New Highs list for a look at other strong performers.Political pressure is also beginning to subside, he said. President Trump has promised to introduce a competitive system that would cut down on escalating drug prices. Meanwhile, the industry has seemingly begun to self-regulate on drug pricing.There are exceptions. Biogen and Ionis Pharmaceuticals' (IONS) Spinraza, a spinal muscular atrophy drug, debuted this year at $125,000 per treatment, or $750,000 in the first year. Porges sees the $37,000 price tag for Regeneron and Sanofi's (SNY) eczema drug Dupixent and the $65,000 price for Roche's (RHHBY) multiple sclerosis drug Ocrevus as more reasonable.""Furthermore, manufacturers of established brands are taking more modest price increases and fewer of them, and are adopting voluntary price-increase limits (which remain too high but are a step in the right direction),"" Porges said.Approvals — many on time and some earlier than expected — have accelerated this year at the Food and Drug Administration, after hitting a five-year low in 2016. So far this year, 20 drugs have grabbed FDA approval, matching the total for all of last year. Those labels also appear broader, meaning drugs could have greater use.Porges sees a number of drug launches coming over the next 18 months that could outdo consensus views. Key among those are gene therapies for rare diseases, treatments for end-stage cancer, and therapies for severe diseases created via a process that harnesses RNA molecules to inhibit certain genes.""This process finally validates all the capital that was invested in these remarkable technologies during the 'boom years' and had seeming headed for disappointment at many points during the bust of the last 24 months,"" Porges said.RELATED:How Biogen's Takeover Prospects Soured In Mere MonthsWill 'Comeback Kid' Regeneron Survive Amgen's Cholesterol Squeeze?

231,VRTX,"Medical-related exchange traded funds have racked up healthy gains this year amid the ongoing quest for longer and healthier lives.One of the outperformers is iShares US Medical Devices (IHI), which gained 20.9% year to date through May 30, well ahead of the S&P 500's 8.7% gain for the period. The $1.4 billion fund boasted a five-year average annual return of 21.6% vs. the benchmark index's 15.4%, according to Morningstar Inc.IHI, launched in May 2006, tracks the Dow Jones U.S. Select Medical Equipment Index.

Abbott, a developer of generic drugs, disease screening systems and other products, is in buy range after clearing a 45.94 flat-base entry on Thursday.XIHI was one of three ETF picks featured in IBD last month by Oscar Pursche, chief executive of Bruderman Brothers and Bruderman Asset Management. ""As opposed to taking a broad view of the health care sector, which we do like overall, we see some great opportunities in the medical device space, to which investors can get exposure through the iShares Medical Device ETF,"" he said.He also noted that the fund's top five holdings account for nearly 40% of the portfolio, which may increase the risk profile. IHI is extended past a 152.83 buy point cleared in April.IBD'S TAKE: Find out which biotechs stand to benefit the most under President Trump's proposed tax reform in this recent tech column.SPDR S&P Health Care Equipment (XHE) returned 16.2% YTD through May 30 and 19.4% for the five-year average.

232,VRTX,"Nobody wins all the time. But $49.9 billion T. Rowe Price Growth Stock Fund (PRGFX) comes pretty close. With Joseph Fath in his fourth year as manager, the fund has outperformed 94% of its large-cap growth rivals tracked by Morningstar Inc. so far this year and over the past one and three years respectively.The fund was up 17.46% for 2017 going into Thursday, far outrunning the 7.94% gain for the S&P 500.Fath has done it without resorting to any trick plays. He's of course aware of how last November's election offers ongoing opportunities to companies that can benefit from rising interest rates, a lighter regulatory load and heightened spending on infrastructure, he wrote to shareholders in January.But his investment approach remains largely the same as in the past. ""We believe that disciplined fundamental analysis will enable us to identify high-quality companies with durable growth prospects that are poised to stand out from the broader market,"" he said. ""We continue to favor companies that have more control over their destiny, are positioned to benefit from powerful secular trends, and are using innovation to disrupt less efficient business models and create new ones.""You can see how that strategy is expressed in the fund's top holdings. Among top holdings as of April 30 was Alphabet (GOOGL), up 20% so far this year. Amazon (AMZN), which is an IBD Leaderboard stock, is up 27%. Apple (AAPL), another Leaderboard stock, is up 32%. Facebook (FB), which is on the IBD 50 list of stocks with strong relative price strength and fundamentals, is up 31%. Mastercard (MA) is up 13%.Fath had placed 63% of his shareholders' money in just two sectors as of the end of last month. The fund's weighting in information-technology stocks was 39%. Its weighting in consumer discretionary was 24%.Some smaller holdings also illustrate Fath's appetite for innovators driven by secular trends. MGM Resorts (MGM) is holding tight after its recent 30.72 breakout from consolidation.It broke out April 27, the day it reported that first-quarter earnings per share jumped 138%. In the U.S., newcomers to MGM's portfolio, the Borgata and National Harbor casino resorts, kicked in to results. Gaming stocks got a boost from news that Macau's gaming revenue rose 18.1% in March, then gained 16.3% for April. MGM has one property in Macau and is slated to open a new resort in the Cotai section of Macau later this year.In addition, the firm has been taming its debt. Its debt-to-equity ratio is down to 209% as of Dec. 31 vs. 313% in 2014.IBD'S TAKE: MGM Resorts ranks No. 1 in IBD's Leisure-Gaming/Equipment industry group. See how its fundamental and technical data stack up against those of rivals at IBD's Stock Checkup.ServiceNow (NOW), trading around 97, is within a 5% buy zone that stretches above a cup pattern's 94.82 buy point.The company develops cloud-based IT software for workflow automation. EPS grew 53%, 26% and 167% the past three quarters.The stock has a 97 Composite Rating from IBD. The Composite Rating, which starts at 1 and runs to 99, combines IBD's five performance ratings. Stocks poised to move higher often have a Comp Rating of 95 or higher.ServiceNow also has an SMR Rating of A from IBD. That means it is in the top 20% of stocks in terms of sales growth, profit margins and return on equity ratios, based on IBD's proprietary formula.Salesforce.Com (CRM) is another stock on the upswing. It broke out above a double-bottom base that had a buy point of 80.47. It's now extended past that buy point, trading around 87. Demand for cloud-based applications is driving growth of this company, which provides customer-relationship-management software and services.Sporting a 95 Comp Rating and an A SMR Rating, EPS rose 14% and 47% the past two quarters.A more recent buy for the mutual fund is MercadoLibre (MELI), which runs an online marketplace and provides an electronic payment service in Latin America. Although widely described as poised for growth the way Amazon was at an earlier stage of its life cycle, the stock is up 81% so far this year and is now extended.MercadoLibre is another IBD 50 member. Shares gapped up 16% on May 5 after the e-commerce giant reported Q1 EPS up 64% on 74% revenue growth. The firm's core marketplace performed well. Its MercadoPago electronic payment service jumped like a pogo stick, as total payment volume sprang up nearly 90%. Its MercadoEnvios shipping services unit saw a nearly 60% boost in items shipped.The stock has an A SMR Rating from IBD.Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX), trading around 114, is extended from its 95.10 handle buy point.

233,VRTX,"X The market ended May with a dull thud, running losses of 0.1% across the Nasdaq, S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average.It was the Nasdaq's seventh straight monthly advance, ending up 2.4% for May. The S&P 500 managed a 1.1% gain, while the Dow industrials eked out only the thinnest of fractional advances.Data played a key role in Wednesday's action, with the Dow industrials, Nasdaq and S&P 500 opening higher, then reversing sharply after the release of the Chicago Purchasing Manager Index for May at 9:45 a.m. ET, although a corrected version of the PMI showed a much stronger report.The first release of the Chicago PMI showed a reading of 55.2, down hard from the prior month's 58.3 tally and below the consensus view for 57.5. The corrected version showed a May reading of 59.4, its highest mark in 2-1/2 years and well above forecasts.Overnight data out of China showed better-than-expected manufacturing growth in May, but the steel, equipment and mining stocks that would normally react positively to such news came under pressure early in the session. In addition, claims from Libya that production had recovered to above its long-term ceiling of 800,900 barrels helped send crude prices down almost 3%, to $48.32 a barrel, leaving it down 2% for the month.Stocks fell, then gradually regained ground after the release of the Federal Reserve's May Beige Book, which showed continued modest growth, but increasing signs that optimism could be flagging. The report was closely watched because it's the last Beige Book report ahead of the Fed's meeting on interest rates in June, when a majority of investors expect another increase in rates.Pfizer (PFE) led the Dow industrials, up 1.6% after announcing that both the Food & Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency had accepted its submissions to expand the approved use of Sutent to include treatment for recurrent renal cell carcinoma in patients following kidney surgery. Pfizer shares are working on their first weekly advance since late April.Pressure on the S&P 500 came from Michael Kors (KORS), Tenet Healthcare (THC), Southwestern Energy (SWN) and Goldman Sachs (GS).Goldman and JPMorgan (JPM) drove the downside among Dow stocks.  Goldman tumbled 3% and JPMorgan 2% following the revelation by JPMorgan's CFO Marianne Lake, speaking at an investor conference, that the firm's trading revenue was down 15% year over year.Losses were more subdued on the Nasdaq, with O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY) and Baidu (BIDU) hardest hit, down 2% apiece. At the top of the Nasdaq 100, Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) rose 2.7%, taking a new high.Analog Devices (ADI) thrashed 7% higher at the open, then backtracked to close 1% higher in big trade. The Norwood, Mass.-company reported a big fiscal Q2 earnings win and delivered Q3 revenue and earnings guidance above analyst expectations. Shares ended in a buy range from an 84.34 buy point in a flat base.IBD 50 stock Control4 (CTRL) roared 8% higher in big trade. Needham upgraded the connected-home software developer to buy, with a 22 price target. The stock is extended after an April rebound from the 10-week moving average.Drugmaker Perrigo (PRGO) led the S&P 500, up 6% after a strong first-quarter report.

234,VRTX,"Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) was the big winner Friday in the wake of a slew of biotechs and drugmakers issuing first-quarter reports Thursday.On the stock market today, Vertex rose 0.75% to 118.30 after climbing as much as 2.6% to its best level since January 2016. Meanwhile, IBD's 425-company Biomed/Biotech industry group edged higher.Celgene (CELG) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) rose 0.1% and 0.7%, respectively.AbbVie (ABBV) stock dropped below a buy point temporarily achieved Thursday at 66.89. Shares fell 0.2% to 65.94 on Friday. AstraZeneca (AZN) stock fell 2% to 30.250.For Vertex, investors are now keyed in on its triple-pill treatment for cystic fibrosis, Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges said in a report Friday. He sees an 80% chance of Vertex successfully bringing the triple-pill regimen to market.IBD'S TAKE: Navigating the biotech trading world can be tricky when relatively unknown names like Esperion Therapeutics (ESPR) launch nearly 200% in mere months. Head to IBD's Technology page for a primer on the industry and which players look good for 2017.Vertex will decide on the Phase 3 strategy for the triple-regimen in the latter half of 2017. The biotech is currently evaluating four next-generation drugs to be used in combination with tezacaftor and ivacaftor, two cystic fibrosis drugs.Porges raised his price target to 132 from 128 and kept his outperform rating on Vertex stock. He noted investors likely prodded Vertex stock on its raised 2017 guide for cystic fibrosis drug Kalydeco to $710 million to $730 million.In a separate report, Porges boosted his price target on Celgene stock to 146 from 141 and kept his market perform rating. Though a 26% miss in sales of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis drug Otezla led to an overall sales miss, Porges noted catalysts in Celgene's future.""Celgene's portfolio is undoubtedly broader than its peers,' and management appears to be focused on creating long-term shareholder value through a focus on later-stage clinical programs,"" he wrote, noting Celgene has key trials in multiple myeloma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, brain tumors and Crohn's disease.""We have generally been cautious in our view of the several late-stage candidates in Celgene's pipeline; however, we now expect several key inflection points from late-stage candidates in Celgene's pipeline in the next couple of years,"" he said.AbbVie ""bucked the rocky earnings season trend,"" meeting consensus views for first-quarter sales and growing revenue from immunosuppressant Humira by 23% in the U.S., Porges said in another report. Adjusted income beat by 2 cents.""Results from the other biopharma names with drugs in the immuno-oncology market have been volatile with some notable misses mainly attributed to overall market weakness,"" he said. ""AbbVie's result suggests that part of the trend may also come from share loss.""Given the solid performance of Humira, AbbVie's biggest moneymaker, Porges is more constructive on AbbVie's outlook for the year. For the year, AbbVie sees sales topping $2 billion in the U.S.Porges boosted his price target on AbbVie stock to 72 from 71 and kept his market perform rating.RELATED:Acorda Topples To 11-Year Low On Street-Lagging Q1 Sales, LossesAlexion Beats On First-Quarter Sales; Profits Top By 15 Cents

235,VRTX,"Shares of biotech leader Supernus Pharmaceuticals (SUPN) briefly broke out Tuesday, but struggled to remain above that key level of support as IBD's 425-company Biomed-Biotech industry group broadly fell.On the stock market today, Supernus stock lifted as much as 4% to top a 32.10 buy point out of an ascending base that began in February. Shares settled back below that buy point by the closing bell and ended the regular session up 1.9% to 31.85.Meanwhile, biotech stocks collectively lost 1.4%. Agios Therapeutics (AGIO), Audentes Therapeutics (BOLD) and Galapagos (GLPG) stocks were among the biggest losers, dropping a respective 9.3%. 6.9% and 3.3%.Supernus is ranked second in the biotech industry group with a Composite Rating of 98, meaning it outperforms all but 2% of stocks in terms of key growth metrics. It trails Celgene (CELG), and is tied with Bioverativ (BIIV), Corcept Therapeutics (CORT), Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) and Cytokinetics (CYTK) in its group.IBD'S TAKE: Want more information on highly-rated stocks?

Nasdaq 100 futures were up 0.1%.On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Russell 2000 climbed 0.7%, with the Nasdaq composite up 0.6%.Big financials such as Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C), JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS) all fell below their 50-day moving averages last week as bond yields fell and investors worried about the prospects for tax cuts and other parts of President Trump's agenda. But on Tuesday, Citigroup and Dow industrials component JPMorgan Chase moved above that key support level, with Bank of America and Goldman Sachs, another Dow stock, on the cusp.Meanwhile, Vertex Pharmaceuticals late Tuesday reported an experimental cystic fibrosis drug improved lung function. Vertex said it will file for approval with the FDA and its European equivalent in the third quarter. Vertex shares shot up 18% to 106 in after-hours trading. That would be a 14-month high.Dave & Buster's reported better-than-expected earnings late Tuesday.

239,VRTX,"Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) sank more than 1% late Wednesday after the biotech topped second-quarter expectations, and reiterated its 2017 sales guidance.XIn after-hours trading on the stock market today, Vertex shares dipped 1.5%, to 161, after closing up 0.9%, at 163.42. Shares have climbed 122% this year on strong data for a triple-pill to treat the underlying genetic mutations tied to cystic fibrosis.During the quarter, Vertex's total sales of cystic fibrosis drugs grew 20.7% vs. the year-earlier quarter to $514 million. Sales of one of the drugs, Orkambi, comprised nearly two-thirds of that total with Kalydeco bringing in the balance.For the second quarter ended June 30, total sales of $544.14 million grew 26.1% and topped the consensus of analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research for $488 million. Adjusted profits rose 62.5% year over year to 39 cents per share, and beat by 4 cents.IBD'S TAKE: Biotech stocks are now ranked third out of 197 groups tracked by IBD. All that's missing to send them higher is mergers and acquisitions, says one industry observer. Visit IBD Industry Themes for a look at potential buyers and sellers.Vertex kept its 2017 guidance for $1.84 billion to $2.07 billion in cystic fibrosis drug sales, with Orkambi bringing in $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion, and Kalydeco accounting for $740 million to $770 million.But the biotech expects to spend more in research and development costs for the year as it continues development of its triple-pill. Earlier this month, Vertex catapulted 20.8% in a day on strong data from those trials.RELATED:Vertex Hits Record High On Results Of Cystic Fibrosis TrialThese 3 Techs Hammer Out New Highs As Nasdaq RalliesVertex Catapults 24% On Strong Trial For Cystic Fibrosis

241,VRTX,"September will be a ""make or break"" month for a number of biotechs, including Alnylam Pharmaceuticals (ALNY), Axovant Sciences (AXON) and Versartis (VSAR), which are expected to present Phase 3 data in the upcoming weeks.XBiotech stocks could be poised for another run, says Loncar Investments Chief Executive Brad Loncar. Year to date, they've risen 28% and hit a 20-month high on Sept. 1. Shares have risen following Gilead Sciences' (GILD) announcement that it would acquire Kite Pharma (KITE).All of that comes before an incredibly newsworthy September that will feature at least five major medical conferences, at least 10 big investor conferences and nearly a dozen Phase 3 trials expected to read out, Loncar told Investor's Business Daily.""This might be the most newsworthy month in biotech history,"" he said. ""What's so amazing this September is there are a ton of Phase 3 trials that are scheduled to read out. The company itself is either going to succeed or fail because of these trial readouts.""""I count seven of them that are make or break for the companies,"" Loncar said.Loncar counts 11 key trial readouts in September. But principal among them, he notes, is Alnylam, which is expected to unveil the results of a trial of a drug dubbed patisiran for a rare disease that causes the buildup of abnormal material called amyloid throughout the body.Success could be a major catalyst for the technologies known as RNA interference and antisense, which essentially turn off malfunctioning genes, Leerink analyst Paul Matteis wrote in a note to clients Tuesday.IBD'S TAKE: Novartis' IBD Relative Strength Rating was boosted Friday to 71 from 65 out of a best-possible 99. The grade shows how the stock's price moved over the past 52 weeks against all other stocks in our database. Head to IBD Data Stories to see how Novartis stacks up against its rivals.Ionis Pharmaceuticals (IONS) is also working on a Phase 3 drug, known as inotersen, to treat the disease called TTR amyloidosis.Matteis calls for an upside of 5%-15% depending on the magnitude of success and safety, and a downside of 15%-20% if the drug proves effective but mixed on safety. He sees downside of 70% if Alnylam's drug fails completely in the trial.According to Loncar, ""Most people are convinced it's going to succeed."" He cited a note that saw the range of failure to success putting Alnylam's stock price at 25 to 105 per share. It closed at 86.80 on Tuesday.""For that company, that's a $7 billion window,"" he said. ""This is a bellwether biotech company. Everyone is counting on this one to succeed, and it probably will. But if that one trial fails, the stock will crash.""Behind Alnylam, Loncar notes that Axovant is expected to announce the results of its drug dubbed intepirdine in mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. Recently, Biogen (BIIB) stock broke out on strong Phase 1b data from an Alzheimer's trial.Axovant is working on a different theory of treating Alzheimer's. Intepirdine is known as a serotonin receptor antagonist, which has potential cognition, memory and learning-enhancing side effects. It was originally developed by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) but sold to Axovant.So far, nothing has worked in Alzheimer's, so there's always some excitement — and trepidation — around trial readouts for the disease, Loncar said. Last December, Eli Lilly (LLY) toppled when its drug, solanezumab, failed in a Phase 3 trial of Alzheimer's.""If Axovant does succeed, we could see a stock go from 20 to 100 in one day,"" he said. Axovant closed at 20.35 on Tuesday. ""That's extreme. But that's the kind of euphoria Alzheimer's can create.""He also notes trials from Versartis and Zogenix (ZGNX) in growth hormone deficiency and a form of epilepsy known as Dravet syndrome, respectively.But it won't just be September that's chock full of catalysts, Leerink analysts wrote in a note to clients Tuesday. After ""a solid year for returns of biopharma stocks"" there are still a number of catalysts in the back half of the year.Among large-caps, Leerink's Geoffrey Porges notes that AbbVie (ABBV) will have data from trials for anti-inflammatory and cancer drugs, and Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) is expected to grab another approval for its drug Soliris to treat a disease in which the immune system attacks healthy cells.Amgen (AMGN) could update its label for LDL cholesterol-lowering drug, Repatha, to include its added benefit on cardiovascular outcomes. Meanwhile, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) and Sanofi (SNY) are appealing a court decision vs. Amgen for their rival drug, Praluent.Celgene (CELG) will have readouts in ulcerative colitis and a form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. FibroGen (FGEN) is expected to have data for fibrosis and anemia drugs. Analysts expect Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) to provide an update with data from its cystic fibrosis trials.Gilead-Kite's CAR-T drug will likely be approved to treat an aggressive form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma in November. This would follow the approval of Novartis' (NVS) Kymriah, a CAR-T drug that treats a form of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in patients up to age 25.""We expect CAR-T to remain one of the most closely followed emerging areas in biotech in the second half of 2017,"" Leerink analyst Michael Schmidt wrote in a note. The launch of Kymriah should read through to drugs from Bluebird Bio (BLUE), Juno Therapeutics (JUNO) and Adaptimmune Therapeutics (ADAP).RELATED:Biogen's Alzheimer's Drug Shows Promise — Could It Break Out?How This J&J Partnership Bit The Dust On Gilead-Kite CompetitionCelgene Breaks Out; These 2 Biotech Giants Close On Buy PointsHow Novartis' Cancer Approval Validates Gilead's $11.9 Billion Kite DealGilead-Kite Deal Boosts Biotech ETF As It Clears Buy Point

Fidelity Investments hopes the same is true for its Growth Discovery Fund (FDSVX) when Jason Weiner takes a five-month leave of absence next year, leaving a new co-manager to call the signals.XAsher Anolic became co-manager on July 1, giving him about four more months to grow more familiar with the fund before marquee manager Weiner starts his leave Jan. 1 to travel with his family and pursue educational opportunities.Anolic, age 39, is paired with one of the industry's top names. Going into Thursday, the $1.5 billion fund that Weiner has helmed was up 25.69% this year, outperforming 95% of its large-cap growth rivals tracked by Morningstar Inc., which averaged an 17.46% gain. The S&P 500 was up 11.83%.Over the past five years, the fund tops 83% of its peers. Weiner has been at the helm since February 2007.""I'm trying to massage the fund into the best growth opportunities the market is offering, with an overlay of valuations sensitivity,"" said Weiner, who is 47 years old.

243,VRTX,"Gilead Sciences (GILD) ""might end up doing nothing in oncology"" if the right takeover deal doesn't present itself, Chief Executive John Milligan reportedly told an analyst Wednesday.XThe third-largest biotech by market cap, Gilead has struggled with declining sales of hepatitis C drugs for several quarters. In the first quarter, Gilead hinted that it could be looking to buy an oncology player. But Gilead remained mum on a potential merger in the recent second quarter.It appears Gilead is looking for a ""transformative"" acquisition, Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges wrote in a note to clients after meeting with the biotech's management Wednesday. The firm is struggling to identify such an opportunity.""As CEO John Milligan explained it, he didn't think it made much sense to buy something small today in the hope it might grow into something large,"" Porges said. Instead, Milligan is looking for a company with ""substantial data, value and scale.""Analysts have suggested Gilead could look to acquire companies like Tesaro (TSRO), Incyte (INCY), Clovis Oncology (CLVS) or Kite Pharma (KITE) in cancer, or Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) in cystic fibrosis. Recently, United Therapeutics (UTHR) spiked on the potential that Gilead could take it over.IBD'S TAKE: The biotech industry is awaiting mergers and acquisitions to spike higher, says one industry observer. How does Gilead fit in? Visit IBD Industry Themes for a closer look.Gilead also noted that it's still interested in fibrosis programs. In 2015-16, it bought two firms with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) programs: Phenex Pharmaceuticals and Nimbus Therapeutics. NASH is a liver disease.In the meantime, Gilead is calling for declines in its hepatitis C unit, despite beating views in the second quarter. Porges sees revenue from hepatitis C drugs falling 30% in 2017 and then dipping 15%-25% annually through 2020.""This decline is likely to accelerate in 2017 and beyond as better competitive hepatitis C regimens come to market,"" he wrote. ""Our outlook for the company's HIV business remains positive, but this is not sufficient to offset the dynamics of the hepatitis C business.""Among those competitive regimens, AbbVie's (ABBV) Mavyret gained approval earlier this month to treat all genotypes of hepatitis C. Gilead acknowledged that AbbVie's biggest advantage is in the treatment of genotypes 2-6, rivaling Gilead's Epclusa and Sovaldi.Chief Operating Officer Kevin Young says the contracting cycle is now in full swing, but that doesn't mean every payer will defer to AbbVie's Mavyret over Gilead's drugs. Mavyret is being priced at a discount to Gilead's Harvoni and Epclusa, Porges said in a note last week.In its HIV unit, Gilead remains bullish on its chances of fending off GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), which is working on two drug combinations. Recently, concerns have emerged regarding the safety of Glaxo's double-drug for HIV and questions of the infection's ability to adapt to treatment.Gilead stock closed down 1.6%, at 72.70, on the stock market today.RELATED:Gilead Could Be Making An Acquisition — But It's Not What You ThinkHow AbbVie's 'Gauntlet' Could Squeeze Gilead's Drugs In Hepatitis CGilead's Hepatitis C Franchise Topples Again, But Shares Up On Beat

244,VRTX,"Biotechs, led by Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN), Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX), outperformed their pharmaceutical brethren in the June quarter, an analyst says as earnings season nears a close.XLeerink analyst Geoffrey Porges  estimates that, of the large-cap biotechs, sales topped Wall Street expectations by an average 5% — with the most impressive beats coming from Alexion, Gilead, Vertex and Biogen (BIIB).Alexion's $912 million in sales topped the consensus by 8%. Gilead's hepatitis C unit fell again in the quarter, but total revenue of $7.14 billion topped by 13%. Vertex reported $544.14 million in sales, beating by 12%. Biogen topped by 10% with $3.1 billion in sales.""By comparison pharma company results were more tepid with Eli Lilly (LLY) and Merck (MRK) delivering significant revenue surprises, but otherwise fairly tepid results consisting of modest beat, in-line results and modest misses,"" Porges said in a note to clients last week.Dow-component Merck and Lilly topped the consensus by 4% and 2%, respectively. Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY), GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) and Roche (RHHBY) delivered modest beats; Novartis (NVS), AstraZeneca (AZN) and Novo Nordisk (NVO) were in line. Sanofi (SNY), Pfizer (PFE) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) missed.On the earnings side, ""performance was even more robust in biotech,"" Porges said. Large-cap biotechs beat by an average 9.8%, relative to the consensus. Bigger pharmas delivered earnings that topped the consensus by an average 4.8%.Revenue growth vs. the year-earlier quarter was 10.5% for biotechs and 2.4% for drug firms, on average, Porges said. Across the board, companies reported improved patient-access to drugs, as well as positive demand, inventory and currency effects.IBD'S TAKE: Biotech fever looked chilly in late July. Can the sector overcome the challenges outlined in this IBD Industry Themes report?

245,VRTX,"In the quarter, rare-disease players on the biotech side did particularly well, Brad Loncar, chief executive of Loncar Investments, told Investor's Business Daily. Biogen, Vertex and Sarepta Therapeutics (SRPT) all positively surprised the market.Spinraza, a treatment for spinal muscular atrophy from Biogen and Ionis Pharmaceuticals (IONS), nearly tripled consensus models. The drug brought in $203 million, obliterating views for $70 million, an analyst said.Sarepta absolutely crushed analyst expectations and rose to an eight-month high in July. Its key drug, Exondys 51, treats Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and brought in $13 million more than analysts had expected. Sarepta also cut loss-expectations by half.""I think that's one category of drugs where investors have been expecting payer pushback,"" Loncar said. ""And so far that hasn't shown up. If there was ever a group of companies that was going to boom more, it's rare-disease companies.""But sentiment has soured since the biotech sector hit an 18-month high in late July. Loncar cited political uncertainty, noting that the lion's share of biotechs and drugmakers with revenue-earning products beat expectations and raised guidance.""The fact they're not trading up (indicates that) investors have already reset their expectations for the year, so maybe it just hasn't been quite as impressive in that context,"" he said. ""We had a big run coming into earnings season, and that played a factor as well.""Uncertainty over tax reform is keeping most major players from looking to make big deals, Porges said. The Trump administration has yet to offer further details on its plan to cut the corporate tax rate to 15%, which would make corporate inversions less desirable.Though Gilead has been under the gun to buy something in the wake of slowing hepatitis C sales, it didn't comment on M&A on its second-quarter call. Dow's Pfizer says it's putting deals on pause while awaiting more on the tax situation out of Washington.Loncar noted Pfizer's call was the one that really ""crystalized"" this theme for the broader medtech sector. He had previously said a big deal in biotech could really send the stocks higher. But that looks unlikely in the near term.""Mega-deals might be on pause until that happens, or if that happens,"" he said. ""That's pretty disappointing. It shouldn't really affect what we call bolt-on deals. For the mega-deals, that seems to be holding things up.""RELATED:Gilead's Hepatitis C Franchise Topples Again, But Shares Are Up On BeatWill Pfizer's Cancer Drugs Help It Grow Without A Merger?This Biotech Just Blew Past Its Buy Point On A $13 Million Sales BeatAstraZeneca Beat, But Stock Dives On Drug Failure; 4 More ReportVertex Sings Late Despite Crushing Sales, Profit Expectations

247,VRTX,"Biotech investors will likely be keyed in on the launches of Biogen's (BIIB) Spinraza and Regeneron's (REGN) Dupixent as first-quarter results roll around, an analyst said Wednesday in a sector preview.IBD's 424-company biotech industry group is ranked No. 6 out of 197 groups tracked, up from No. 42 just 13 weeks ago. But the first quarter will be ""choppy"" amid inventory and seasonality challenges, Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges said Wednesday.""Our analysis suggests that Q1 is not going to be a breakout or particularly impressive quarter for the large-cap names in our coverage universe, but neither is it going to be the disaster that the slowing results in Q4 might suggest,"" he wrote in a note to clients.Given the flux in shipping days and inventory levels, investors are likely to pay most attention to key launches already underway or anticipated for 2017.Biogen's spinal muscular atrophy drug with Ionis Pharmaceuticals (IONS) is likely to be scrutinized amid recent payer pushback. Meanwhile, investors will be looking for commentary on how Roche's (RHHBY) multiple sclerosis drug, Ocrevus, might hurt Biogen's MS franchise. Celgene (CELG) is also working on an MS drug, ozanimod.Expectations are still high for Regeneron and Sanofi's (SNY) Dupixent, an eczema injection that launched at the end of the first quarter.""Initial feedback from the company and physicians after a month of commercialization will be critical to assess the launch sales trend, especially any anecdotes about the accessibility for patients after the price announcement,"" he wrote.IBD'S TAKE: Gilead Sciences is suffering from a slowing hepatitis C drug franchise. Could it buy itself out of the decline? Head to IBD Industry Themes for a better look at what Gilead may have its sights on acquiring.Amgen (AMGN) and Regeneron are also likely to get questions on reimbursement changes for their medicines that lower ""bad"" LDL cholesterol. Amgen showed in a recent study that lowering LDL cholesterol reduces the risk for heart attacks and strokes, and the Street is hoping that will push payers to reimburse for the drugs.In upcoming filings, investors will look for Amgen commentary on migraine drug erenumab and romosozumab, a drug to treat osteoporosis in postmenopausal women.

248,VRTX,"Eli Lilly (LLY) and AbbVie (ABBV) topped a Credit Suisse evaluation of pharmaceutical companies heading into 2017, leaving more challenged Pfizer (PFE), AstraZeneca (AZN) and Novo Nordisk (NVO) in the dust.But the PharmaValues 2017 list did little for IBD's 44-company Medical-Ethical Drugs industry group, which fell a fraction on the stock market today, a fifth consecutive down day. The group is down more than 20% this year, touched a three-month low Monday and is trading below its 50-day moving average.IBD'S TAKE: Biotech and pharmaceutical stocks have been trampled in the last month. With Q3 earnings reports coming up, can they climb the ""wall of worry?""Credit Suisse ranked 48 Big Pharma stocks on factors like enterprise value/net present value, pricing and replacement powers, and sales growth. Overall, Eli Lilly topped the list, with Europe-based Sanofi (SNY) and Novartis (NVS) trailing closely.AbbVie ranked highest on fundamentals, with investors likely assuming a long life span for Humira, Credit Suisse analysts wrote in a research report. Humira is the brand name for adalimumab, Abbvie's drug to treat arthritis, plaque psoriasis, ankylosing spondylitis, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.AbbVie stock, though, slipped a small fraction Monday, while Lilly stock fell nearly 1%.Meanwhile, Pfizer was ""weak across the board,"" AstraZeneca has a high EV/NPV (enterprise value to net present value) and Novo Nordisk is exposed to U.S. pricing pressure.For AstraZeneca, investors are potentially factoring in its oncology pipeline, Credit Suisse says, but ""recent results from others demonstrate significant risk.""Teva Pharmaceuticals (TEVA) scored well in EV/NPV valuation, with most of its sales power driven by its generic division. Gilead Sciences (GILD), Incyte (INCY) and Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) are all trading at a discount with Vertex only needing ""minimal further pipeline success to justify the current valuation,"" the report said.Among biotechs, Vertex topped Credit Suisse's list, with Amgen (AMGN) flailing at the bottom. Like pharmaceuticals, IBD's 421-company Medical-Biomed/Biotech industry group, has been down this month. The group fell a fraction Monday and, like the ethical drugs group, also fell for a fifth straight trading day, and fell for the seventh day of the past eight trading days.Though near the bottom overall, AstraZeneca scored well in terms of pricing power with its shift toward oncology products. But Novo Nordisk is in ""the eye"" of the diabetes-rebate storm in the U.S., Credit Suisse said.Pricing power, Credit Suisse analysts note, is important as it helps ""companies to resist discount pressures from formulary managers and governments."" In that regard, Allergan (AGN) is the clear winner, with only Shire (SHPG) rivaling it in the dry-eye market.Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN), which focuses on rare diseases, is the most exceptional biotech, the analysts said, while Biomarin (BMRN), Incyte and Vertex also get high marks for being unique.Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) and Eli Lilly beat out the cohort on R&D productivity and ability to drive the current pipeline.This follows the dramatic seesaw between Bristol-Myers Squibb and Merck (MRK) after Bristol-Myers' lung cancer drug, Opdivo, failed to meet a key endpoint. Eli Lilly scored well on its launches of Trulicity for diabetes and Taltz for psoriasis.

249,VRTX,"Investors could toast the third quarter, the strongest of the year, but September alone was about as exciting as a bottle of bubbly that gone's flat.In the third quarter, the S&P 500 rose 3.85%, lifting U.S. diversified stock mutual funds by 4.8% on average. The broad market advanced despite barely breaking even in September, nosing upward a modest 0.02%. Stock funds edged ahead a mere 0.22% last month.That raised stock funds to a 6.38% gain year to date.The stock market's start-and-stop motion in the third quarter has prompted many fund managers to plan ahead by sticking with names driven by strong trends, such as the shift to cloud computing, and with companies that seem capable of grinding out growth no matter how blah growth may be in the broader economy.Click Here To See A List Of IBD Mutual Fund Quarterly Leaders""The first half of the year saw more of a defensive-led rally,"" said Lew Piantedosi, a manager of seven Eaton Vance funds with $3.8 billion in total assets.

Becton develops medical supplies, Medtronic develops implantable cardiac devices and other products and UnitedHealth is the industry's biggest managed-care provider.Yet Rottinghaus is shopping among biotechs because prices are so beaten down.He is underweight in the tech sector. But he likes companies benefiting from the secular trend of cloud computing's growth. Those include Alphabet and Microsoft (MSFT). He also likes the sustainable secular growth of Visa (V) and Facebook.Rottinghaus also likes NextEra Energy (NEE), which has a 2.9% dividend yield.""It's the largest renewable-energy generator in the U.S.,"" he said. ""Its dividend yield is roughly 3%. But we wouldn't own it without the low-double-digit earnings growth we expect from them.""Growth-oriented sectors led stock funds' third-quarter charge.

250,VRTX,"Biotech Gilead (GILD) is most likely to scoop up Incyte (INCY) over the next 12 months, according to a survey of 244 industry watchers by Evercore ISI investment bank, ahead of the presidential election pitting Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton.Of those surveyed, 16% say they'd most like to see Gilead purchase Incyte, and 14% identified Incyte as the biopharma most likely to be acquired over the next year. Nearly 12% and 10%, respectively, see Biogen (BIIB) and BioMarin Pharmaceutical (BMRN) as targets.Gilead, Acadia Pharmaceuticals (ACAD), Celgene (CELG) and Kite Pharma (KITE) are least likely to be targeted, with only 2% of industry experts identifying each as a likely takeover candidate. That's a departure from Needham's analysis last week identifying 11 potential suitors for Acadia.An Incyte takeover would likely come at a heavy price. As of June 30, Gilead had $24.6 billion in cash, equivalents and market securities on hand. By market cap, Gilead is the No. 2 biotech, trailing only Amgen, but it's widely viewed as among the big biotechs that most needs to be active on the M&A front. Incyte has a $17 billion market capitulation. Smaller coalitions, 10% and 8%, say Gilead could buy Vertex (VRTX) or Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY).Outside M&A, the lion's share of experts (52%) expect biotechs to outperform the broader markets over the next six months, whereas 54% of respondents say biopharmas will merely be in line. Both will trade up after the election, say 65% of experts.But IBD's 241-company Medical-Biomed/Biotech industry group is down 16% this year, but those losses were early in the year, when the overall market tumbled. The group is up more than 25% since late June and now ranks No. 6 out of 197 groups tracked, up from No. 160 just 13 weeks ago.At the close on the stock market today, the group was up more than 1.4%, bucking a two-day downtrend.IBD'S TAKE: The latest Industry Snapshot explores biotech M&A and promising new drugs, and which stocks are leading the biotech sector.Drug pricing initiatives could rout stocks this year, an RBC analyst said Thursday. Though he acknowledged drugmakers like Amgen (AMGN), Gilead, Celgene, Biogen, Regeneron (REGN) and Vertex could easily find loopholes to skirt new regulations.Still, fewer than 1% of the people polled by Evercore expect the government to take meaningful action on drug pricing in 2016. Nearly 44% (the largest chunk) say the government won't ever push for a reduction in drug prices.Other predictions stem around specific companies. Only 14% expect Eli Lilly's (LLY) Alzheimer's drug, Solanezumab, to hit cognition and function endpoints. More broadly, 42% say it will hit cognition but miss on function.More than half (51%) say Celgene's Phase 3 testing for GED-0301, an oral mongersen treatment for Crohn's, will fail to reach the overwhelming efficacy seen in Phase 2 testing. During Phase 2, 67% of patients taking 160 milligrams were in clinical remission on day 15.A small 7% say Celgene will see better results in Phase 3 testing. Only 3% expect the study to fail entirely. If the results show endoscopic improvement, 64% of respondents say Celgene stock will pop. A third expect shares to remain stagnant.RELATED:Gilead 'Paralyzed' On Likely Hep C Share LossAmgen, Biogen, Gilead Could Spike VA Pricing To Skirt California MeasureRegeneron Pharmaceuticals Falls As Combo Therapy Worse Than Eylea Alone

251,VRTX,"A California ballot initiative requiring the state's Medicaid arm to buy drugs at comparable prices to what the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs pays could backfire, thus preserving sales for the nation's biggest drugmakers, RBC analyst Michael Yee said Thursday.Proposition 61, the California Drug Price Relief Act (CDPRA), sounds good in theory, Yee wrote in a research report. But that's assuming drugmakers don't simply eliminate the steep discounts already provided the VA.After all, he says, that's what happened in 25 years ago.""Congress passed a 1991 law requiring drugmakers to grant Medicaid similar discounts given to manufacturers' larger customers,"" he wrote. ""But the law ultimately prompted manufacturers to raise prices paid by larger customers, including the VA.""That will likely be the fate for the CDPRA, he wrote.Californians appear to overwhelmingly support the initiative. Early this month, a University of Southern California and Los Angeles Times survey found 66% of 1,900 respondents approve of the CDPRA. A San Francisco firm's poll in July which found 73% in support.For drugmakers like Amgen (AMGN), Gilead (GILD), Celgene (CELG), Biogen (BIIB), Regeneron (REGN) and Vertex (VRTX), the CDPRA offers merely a headline risk, Yee wrote. Assuming a large 20% price cut to Medicaid, 2017 and 2018 sales and earnings would decrease by 2%, as only 10%-20% of the companies' U.S. products are exposed to Medicaid.If all 50 states enacted such a measure, it could mean a 2%-3% earnings per share risk for large-cap players, Yee wrote. This year, though, California is alone with its initiative. An Ohio proposition didn't make it to the ballot.""However, VA price discounts would then probably become nonexistent since lower VA prices would lead to reduced Medicaid prices,"" he wrote, noting Medicaid already gets a 23% discount.To date, CDPRA opposition has only spent 5% of $87 million in donations. Yee expects that spending to ramp up significantly ahead of the Nov. 8 ballot. RBC research shows 100% of all propositions in 2014 were won by the side that had the most funding. CDPRA supporters have raised only about $9.5 million.Supporters, which include former presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, say the CDPRA could save 5 million Californian taxpayers $5.7 billion in 10 years, since the VA pays 20% to 25% less than other government agencies for prescription drugs.Opponents argue the CDPRA could invalidate existing contracts between the state and drugmakers, forcing increased state drug prices and reducing funding for Medi-Cal. The initiative could also increase state expenses as employees spend time and resources matching state prices to what the VA pays.IBD'S TAKE: IBD's 421-company Medical-Biomed/Biotech industry group ranks No. 6 out of 197 groups tracked, having climbed from No. 160 just 13 weeks ago. Stocks have heated on Wall Street expectations of major Big Pharma M&A action. However, on the stock market today, the group closed down 3.6%, hurt by Intra-Cellular Therapies' stock plunge.

252,VRTX,"Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) shares fell Tuesday after it said late Monday that it had stopped a cystic-fibrosis drug trial due to futility.The phase-three trial was testing a combination of Vertex's ivacaftor, sold individually as Kalydeco, in combination with a pipeline drug called VX-661 to treat CF patients with one copy of the F508del mutation and one copy of a mutation that results in minimal CFTR protein function, known as ""het/min"" patients. An independent monitoring board conducted an interim analysis and determined that there wasn't enough improvement in patient lung function to be worth continuing.Nonetheless, Vertex says the combo could work with some extra help.""These results suggest that a triple combination regimen may provide this group of people with CF the best chance at obtaining a meaningful benefit, and we look forward to beginning the first study of a next-generation corrector together with VX-661 and ivacaftor in this group of patients later this year, pending data from our ongoing phase-1 studies in healthy volunteers,"" Vertex Chief Medical Officer Jeffrey Chodakewitz said in a statement.IBD'S TAKE: Orkambi's launch last year turned Vertex profitable the last three quarters, but its previous years of losses have dragged on its longer-term measures such as its EPS Rating and three-year sales growth rate. Still, analysts are forecasting strong earnings growth at least through 2020, so its ratings will likely improve.Indeed, most analysts have been seeing the triple combo, rather than the double, as the successor to Vertex's currently marketed drug Orkambi, so they weren't too disappointed by the failure of the duo.""The effects of this failure on Vertex's expected entry into additional CF populations will likely be small: Expectations were low, and Vertex is continuing with plans to investigate their next-generation triplet therapies in this (het/min) patient population, with a launch potentially as early as 2019,"" wrote Evercore ISI analyst Mark Schoenebaum in an email. ""Success in the failed trial would have opened up this population (the largest remaining untreated CF subpopulation, with 40% of all CF patients, 12,000 patients) to treatment one to two years before it was expected, but the company has been clear that its long-term goals rest with the triple combination.""Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges noted the lack of safety issues in the trial, which is important for future combos.""Orkambi, which currently treats the majority of potentially addressable patients of VX-661, is associated with discontinuations due to side-effects that have lowered the persistence of patients on therapy and have reduced the peak revenue potential for Orkambi,"" Porges wrote in a research note. ""With a cleaner safety profile -- especially in terms of shortness of breath -- VX-661 could still increase revenues without showing superior efficacy to Orkambi or opening new patient subpopulations.""Vertex stock closed down 2.4% to 100 on the stock market today. Vertex stock hit a seven-month high of 103.73 last Tuesday, but shares are not highly rated, with an IBD Relative Price Strength Rating of just 45.
"
253,VRTX,"After a typically slow stretch in late August, biotech news is bound to pick up as companies prepare for the fall season of conferences and investor days. Some of the most stock-moving events will likely be updates on key clinical trials, with several expected in September.• Celgene (CELG) is due to release long-awaited midstage trial results on GED-0301, or mongersen, a drug for Crohn's disease that it licensed in 2014 for $700 million. The drug initially sparked some excitement on Wall Street because of its strong two-week remission rate, which beat even the leading injected anti-tumor necrosis factor drugs, such as AbbVie's (ABBV) Humira, Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ) Remicade and Amgen's (AMGN) Enbrel. But the next data set will cover a full year and evaluate patients by endoscopy rather than just symptoms.Investors' confidence was somewhat shaken when Celgene refused to provide an interim analysis on the trial, which some interpreted as a lack of confidence in the numbers. Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges wrote that a close inspection of earlier data also raises red flags.""If the trial is consistent with the earlier phase I/II result (on which the original investment was made), the endoscopic remission rate would be in the 60-70% range, which is well above that seen with even the best biologicals or immunomodulators,"" Porges wrote in a July 25 research note. ""In fact, our assessment of the earlier results, and the lack of CRP (C-reactive protein) response, which is a biomarker of Crohn's disease inflammatory activity, suggests to us that the result could be materially lower than the anti-TNFs, with remission rates more likely to be in the 20-30% range.""He noted that since GED-0301 is oral rather than injected, it could still find a market niche, though it would not be the mega-blockbuster initially hoped for.IBD'S TAKE: The Medical-Biotech group has been on a roll lately, rising from No. 126 to No. 20 in IBD's Industry Group Rankings in the last eight weeks. To see what other industries are hot, follow our Industry Themes column.• Kite Pharma (KITE) is expected to release headline data from Zuma-1, a phase-two trial of its CAR-T cell therapy KTE-019 in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. CAR-T cells, or chimeric antigen receptor-T cells, are genetically engineered to attack cancerous cells. The trial results are crucial because Kite hopes to use them to file for FDA approval of the treatment, which could make it the first CAR-T therapy to hit the market next year.RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee estimated Friday that the study would yield a 60% to 70% overall response rate (percent of tumors that shrank) and perhaps a 40% complete response rate (tumor disappearance) based on earlier data. But in an initiation report Tuesday, BTIG analyst Dane Leone wrote that much depends on how the data stack up against results from competitors Juno Therapeutics (JUNO) and Novartis (NVS), which is as yet unknown.""Novartis may present pivotal data sets at ASH 2016 along with the potential for first data from J&J's CD19 bi‐specific antibody,"" wrote Leone, referring to the American Society for Hematology conference in December. ""Juno is also expected to present clinical updates from ongoing CD19 trials.""• Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) should provide a report on its ""triplet"" pills for cystic fibrosis, consisting of its already marketed drug, ivacaftor (Kalydeco), combined with experimental drug VX-661 and one of two additional drugs, VX-152 and VX-440.Another trial of ivacaftor and VX-661 alone recently failed, but it did present a clean safety profile and analysts have been expecting a triplet to be the next-generation treatment in any case.Also this month, the FDA is due to render a verdict on whether to expand the label on Vertex's already marketed CF drug Orkambi to children aged 6 to 11.RELATED:Is EpiPen's Price The FDA's Fault?

255,VRTX,"JPMorgan Large Cap Growth Fund (SEEGX) is barreling down the fast lane. Manager Giri Devulapally's fuel? Lots of financial and technology stocks, including Morgan Stanley (MS), Mastercard (MA) and Applied Materials (AMAT).X (IBD)And amid a Friday rally by the broad market as of midday, key fund holdings are rising too.Chip gear maker Applied Materials was up 2.92%. Internet television network Netflix (NFLX) was up 1.77%. Regeneron Pharmaceutical (REGN), maker of the Eylea macular degeneration eye treatment, was up 1.35%. Consumer electronics colossus Apple (AAPL) was up 0.84%. And credit card provider Visa (V) was up 0.69%.The $12.5 billion fund was up 23.04% this year going into Friday, topping 94% of its large-cap growth fund peers tracked by Morningstar Inc., which averaged 15.66%. The S&P 500 was up 9.96%. The mutual fund's 23.23% gain the past 12 months topped 96% of its peers as well as the S&P 500.How has the fund achieved such eye-popping gains? It starts with the fund's investment approach. Fund literature boils it down to: ""Targeting companies with large markets, sustainable competitive advantages and strong price momentum, the Large Cap Growth Fund seeks to harness the return potential of America's fastest-growing companies.""The fund is rare in its naming strong price momentum as a trait sought in stocks and indicates acknowledgement that technical analysis plays an important role in its stock selection.Financials and tech were JPMorgan Large Cap Growth's largest sector overweights as of June 30 vs. its benchmark, the Russell 1000 Growth Index.Devulapally recently told shareholders that among financials he still has ""a positive view on companies with exposure to capital markets and interest rates."" His information technology overweight, he added, ""continues to be driven by a variety of industries, such as payments, semiconductors, video games, software and mobility.""That outlook has led Devulapally's fund to such holdings as money-center bank Morgan Stanley. The stock is up 9% so far this year.Brokerage Charles Schwab (SCHW), up 1% this year, benefits from the float on customers' cash. Float is profit on cash between the time a customer authorizes disbursement and when the cash actually leaves the account. Rising interest rates lift the profit on float.In the tech stock grouping, credit payment processor Mastercard is up 28% this year. Chip gear maker Applied Materials is up 38%.IBD'S TAKE: Applied Materials is a member of the IBD 50 list of stocks with strong relative price strength and fundamentals.Video game publisher Electronic Arts (EA), another member of the IBD 50, is up 49% this year. Earnings per share grew 40%, 70% and 343% the past three quarters. That's a nice rally from the prior two quarters, in which EPS fell.In the software space, digital media and marketing software firm Adobe Systems (ADBE) vaulted past Wall Street's estimates for its fiscal second quarter on June 20, reporting accelerating sales and earnings growth for the period. It also guided analysts higher for Q3. EPS grew 45%, 42% and 44% the past three stanzas.Its digital media segment provided 68% of total corporate Q2 revenue.And online payment processor PayPal (PYPL), an IBD 50 stock, is up 51% this year.Among other holdings, Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) has an IBD Composite Rating of 98.Share price has soared 104% this year. Strong data for a triple-pill to treat the underlying genetic mutations tied to cystic fibrosis have been a key driver of the stock. The biotech company expects to spend more in research and development costs for the year as it continues development of its triple-pill.Graphics chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA), yet another member of the IBD 50, benefits from the shift toward more use of graphics processing units, away from regular CPU computer chips, because of their faster processing speeds in applications such as gaming, artificial intelligence and self-driving cars.EPS grew at a triple-digit pace in four of the past five quarters.Nvidia is the No. 1 stock in IBD's Electronics-Semiconductor Fabless industry group. It earned that spot in part by posting a 56% jump in sales last quarter and a 27.6% annual pretax margin. You can compare its other technical and fundamental strengths with its rivals' at IBD's easy-to-use Stock Checkup tool.What else does the fund have going for it? Large-cap stock mutual funds have outperformed other U.S. diversified stock fund categories over the past six and 12 months as well as the past two, three and five years. Reflecting this fund's commitment to large-cap stocks, it owns four Dow Jones Industrial stocks: Visa, Microsoft (MSFT), Apple and Home Depot (HD).Visa, which is also one of the fund's payments stocks, is up 32% this year.Software titan Microsoft is up 17% this year.IPhone maker Apple, up 37% this year, is another one of Devulapally's mobility stocks.Home improvement retailer Home Depot fell nearly 3% on Tuesday. The company reported Q2 results that beat Wall Street expectations. But, as IBD reported, analysts see a potential slowdown in its stronger full-year outlook.After pulling back Thursday and Friday, shares were up 10% for the year.RELATED:Reynolds American Bolsters JPMorgan Large Cap Growth FundHow To Make Your Boss Add $76K To Your 401(k)

256,VRTX,"Biotech stocks toppled midday Thursday in line with broader indexes, and included pitfalls from large players like Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX), United Therapeutics (UTHR) and Spark Therapeutics (ONCE) as long-term views look weak or uncertain.XOn the stock market today, Vertex dove 4.4% to 156.19; United Therapeutics fell 4.8% to 125.10; and Spark dipped 3.3% to 70.29. Broadly, IBD's 439-company biotech industry group lost 2.3%, reflecting major indexes that trended down.This followed beats from Amgen (AMGN), Biogen (BIIB), Gilead Sciences (GILD), Vertex, Celgene (CELG) and Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) this week. All but Vertex increased some of their 2017 guidance. Vertex kept its full-year view, but sees a slowdown in the third quarter.Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges trimmed his third-quarter views for Vertex and cut his 2017 sales forecast by 2%. He kept an outperform rating on Vertex but his price target on the stock got a haircut to 187 from 188.Second-quarter sales of cystic fibrosis drugs Orkambi and Kalydeco beat expectations. But Porges noted some of that was due to inventory stocking ahead of the anticipated summer slowdown. Vertex is also working on a triple-pill in cystic fibrosis.Outside its cystic fibrosis franchise, Vertex said on its earnings conference call that it could look to make small technology-based early-stage acquisitions, but will likely avoid ""the large-stage or large investments many investors fear,"" Porges said in a report.For United Therapeutics, second-quarter sales were the highest the company has ever seen at $445 million, ""but resumption of growth is not guaranteed,"" Leerink analyst Joseph Schwartz said in a note to clients.United is working on drugs to treat a rare blood disease known as pulmonary arterial hypertension, or PAH. Schwartz increased his third- and fourth-quarter sales models by 5%-7% after the strong second-quarter report.IBD'S TAKE: Biotechs are now ranked fourth out of 197 groups tracked by IBD. But mergers and acquisitions could send them higher with Vertex considered both a takeover target and an acquirer in some circles. Get the deep dive via IBD Industry Themes.""Due to lack of any curative therapy for PAH, providing a suite of PAH medicines could keep patients transitioning between United products,"" he said. ""However, we are reluctant to assume that a rebound in product sales this quarter will materialize resumption of growth trajectory in other United products.""Also Thursday, Alexion and Celgene topped expectations. Alexion rose 2.2% to 133.92, but Celgene still dipped 2.6% to 134.15.  Investors were likely looking for Celgene to raise its top-line guidance for 2017, but instead Celgene lifted its adjusted profits forecast for the year to $7.25-$7.35 a share.""The main surprise in this result is the lack of an increase in top-line guidance, which we would normally have expected at this time of year,"" Leerink's Porges said. ""Since the second quarter of 2010, this is only the their time that Celgene has not increased their revenue guidance in the second quarter.""Elsewhere in biotech, analysts were more bullish on Gilead which saw hepatitis C drug sales fall a collective 27.5% on slower revenue from Harvoni and Sovaldi. But that beat analysts' view, which predicted a fall of 32%, Porges said. He raised his price target to 83 from 74.The magnitude of the beat points to stabilizing hepatitis C drug sales, he said. But ""the windfall may be short-lived, however, as AbbVie's (ABBV) next-generation doublet is set to enter the market within weeks and is likely to represent the first real competition to Gilead's hepatitis C dominant market position.""RELATED:AstraZeneca Beats, But Stock Dives On Drug Failure; 4 More ReportThis Biotech Nearly Tripled Street Expectations For One Key DrugGilead's Hepatitis C Franchise Topples Again, But Shares Up On Beat

257,VRTX,"Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) stock rocketed by nearly a fourth late Tuesday after the biotech reported positive Phase 1 and 2 results of a triple-pill treatment for cystic fibrosis, rivaling fellow biotech Galapagos (GLPG).In after-hours trading on the stock market today, Vertex had catapulted 24.1% to 163.99, after rising 2.3%, to 132.16, during the regular session. Meanwhile, shares of Galapagos gave back the 1.82 earned during the regular session and were down 3.2% to 75. Shares had climbed 2.4%, to close the regular session at 77.49.The triple-pill regimen aims to correct underlying genetic mutations associated with the lung condition known as cystic fibrosis. Vertex is hoping to ultimately treat the 75,000 patients in North America, Europe and Australia with the condition.According to Vertex in a news release, ""These are the first data to demonstrate the potential to treat the underlying cause of cystic fibrosis in these patients, who have a severe and difficult-to-treat type of the disease.""Data from the Phase 2 trials showed improvement in patients' ability to forcefully expel air over the course of one second in combinations using drugs known as VX-152 and VX-440. Respectively, air expelled improved by 9.7 and 12 percentage points from baseline, on average.IBD'S TAKE: Vertex is expected to be among those leading the biotech rally on the second-quarter earnings season. Head to IBD's Technology page for more on why the biotech rally could still see another 15% upside.In a Phase 1 trial of patients with a specific set of mutations, their ability to forcefully expel air improved by 9.6 percentage points from baseline, on average, when treated with a triple-pill that included the drug known as VX-659.Overall, the trials tested three different triple combinations using Vertex's four next-generation correctors. The regimens were generally well-tolerated across all three studies and the majority of adverse events were mild to moderate, Vertex said.RELATED:Gilead Could Acquire This Biotech — But Vertex Is Still Better: AnalystGilead And Vertex Should Join — But Don't Hold Your Breath: AnalystEven An Upgrade Couldn't Save Vertex From The Biotech Deluge

259,VRTX,"Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) stock blasted to a record high Wednesday on Phase 1 and 2 trial data for triple-pill regimens that should have cystic fibrosis patients ""breathing easy,"" according to one analyst.XBy the closing bell on the stock market today, Vertex had catapulted 20.8% to 159.69, after earlier running up more than 26% in heavy volume. Shares hit an all-time high, helping biotech stocks gap up a collective 1.1%.The stock launch followed Vertex's announcement late Tuesday of better-than-expected results in three trials testing drugs known as VX-152, VX-440 and VX-659 combined with two other cystic fibrosis drugs. Patients treated with the combinations were better able to forcefully expel air, on average.Vertex is likely to advance one triple-pill regimen into Phase 3 trials in 2018. Credit Suisse analyst Alethia Young suggested Vertex could gain accelerated approval for the triple-pill in 2018 with Phase 3 trials acting as confirmatory studies.""In terms of accelerated approval, we think the question will come down to the size of the safety database since the next-generation correctors are a novel mechanism of action,"" she wrote in a note to clients. Vertex is looking at four possible combinations.The triple-pill regimen aims to treat underlying genetic mutations associated with cystic fibrosis, a lung condition. Analysts broadly expect shorter trials in a population of 24,000 patients with a specific mutation for whom there are limited treatment options.Vertex is now about 1.5 years ahead of prior estimates and 2.5 years ahead of potential competition, says Janney analyst Debjit Chattopadhyay. Fellow biotech Galapagos (GLPG) is also working on a triple-pill regimen for cystic fibrosis.IBD'S TAKE: Vertex's big move up landed the biotech on IBD's Leaderboard on Wednesday. The company now holds an IBD Composite Rating of 98, meaning it outranks 98% of other stocks on the market.""Clearly there are outstanding questions on which of the four compounds advance into the pivotal program, but this is a high-class problem to have based on the efficacy and tolerability profile thus far,"" he wrote in a note to clients.Chattopadhyay calls for the triple-pill combination to add $4 billion to the company's sales by 2025 and sees Vertex's cystic fibrosis franchise approaching peak sales of $7.5 billion, expanding at a compound annual growth rate of 19%.Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges boosted his price target on Vertex stock to 188 from 132 and sees Vertex as 100% likely to succeed in two types of cystic fibrosis patients with specific genetic mutations, up from 80% previously.Porges forecasts Vertex launching a triple-pill in 2020 vs. earlier views for 2021. He models $1.9 billion in 2021 sales growing to $6.5 billion longer term. Overall sales of cystic fibrosis drugs are expected to reach $8.65 billion in 2025.Vertex will have to be cautious on how it prices the triple-pill, Porges said. He expects the regimen to cost about $164,000 in the U.S., which is lower than the $217,000 price for Vertex's Orkambi, a two-pill cystic fibrosis treatment.""Given the outcry concerning the existing prices of Vertex's combinations, and the larger addressable market for these products, we believe it is most prudent to forecast the company's revenue growth based on increases in patient adoption and treatment persistence, rather than by forecasting product price upgrades,"" he said.Credit Suisse's Young and Janney's Chattopadhyay see Vertex as a potential takeover candidate in the wake of the strong cystic fibrosis trial data Tuesday. Chattopadhyay calls Vertex ""the most logical large-cap (merger) target.""Young sees $220-$240 per share, at a total price of $55 billion to $60 billion, as a fair value to buy Vertex. Vertex has a market cap of $40.3 billion. Gilead Sciences (GILD) has been suggested as a potential acquirer.RELATED:Vertex Catapults 24% On Strong Trial For Cystic Fibrosis DrugGilead Could Acquire This Biotech — But Vertex Is Still Better: AnalystEven An Upgrade Couldn't Save Vertex From The Biotech Deluge

260,VRTX,"These are salad days for the biotech sector, as a number of industry leaders are hitting new highs and the group as a whole is near the top of its game in terms of stock performance.XStock inflows hit $1.6 billion over the last four weeks, and there have been a number of clinical trial successes and a new industry-friendly Food and Drug Administration regime is in place.As a result, Investors Business Daily's 439-company Biotech industry group has clawed its way to No. 4 out of 197 groups tracked by IBD from sixth just last week. Shares look likely to close at an 18-month high on the stock market today. And that's before a slew of earnings next week.""Just about everything that could be going right for biotech lately has been going right,"" Brad Loncar, chief executive of Loncar Investments, told IBD on Friday. The onslaught of biotech earnings next week could really give investors some fodder, he said.But there's one thing missing, says Loncar: mergers and acquisitions.""If that last piece fits into the puzzle, then the biotech sector could really be cooking with gas,"" he said.Gilead Sciences (GILD) is the likely linchpin. Loncar calls Gilead the ""poster child"" for a large biotech that needs to do a deal. In 2016, Gilead's multibillion-dollar hepatitis C drug franchise toppled for the first time. Now, Gilead says it's interested in a deal in the cancer space.Though some analysts have keyed in on Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) as a smart acquisition, Loncar sees Gilead as more likely to buy an early cancer asset — something it can develop and commercialize, rather than putting its money to work on buying a developed revenue stream.Vertex is already a hugely successful biotech in its own right, he said. Earlier this year, Vertex delivered the best news this year in the space, he pointed out. It had ""exceptional results"" in Phase 1 and 2 trials looking at a triple-pill to treat cystic fibrosis. The stock gapped up nearly 21% on Wednesday.IBD'S TAKE: Rare disease and cancer plays have been front and center in the biotech sector as of late. Could these cutting-edge firms keep the rally going? Head to the Industry Snapshot for a deeper dive.""That's a multibillion-dollar stock,"" Loncar said. ""When a company like Vertex goes up 20%, that's something everybody in the stock market notices.""Gilead is set to report its second-quarter earnings Wednesday. But it will be sandwiched among a slew of strong contenders in the biotech space including Celgene (CELG), Amgen (AMGN), Biogen (BIIB) and Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN).No. 1 biotech Celgene is slated to report its second-quarter earnings before the open Thursday. The stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 99, leading its 438 peers and is sitting at a high last seen in July 2015.Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges says Celgene and Alexion will be bellwethers for the group this time, in the same way Dow's Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) is often seen as a proxy for the pharmaceutical group. He calls for Celgene to beat and raise, and for Alexion to rise by topping low views.Alexion is slated for Thursday. On Tuesday, Amgen could overtake a four-month high and jump to a record high if its second-quarter earnings report proves strong. Shares broke out of a cup-with-handle on July 13 at a 175.55 buy point and still remain in a buy zone.This trio could help catapult the sector, analysts say. Meanwhile, on the pharma side, investors will key in to AstraZeneca (AZN) early Thursday. In recent weeks rumors have emerged that Chief Executive Pascal Soriot could jump ship for Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA).Loncar notes that the timing of those rumors were bad for AstraZeneca. AstraZeneca is set ""any day now"" to report the results of an immuno-oncology combination trial in lung cancer. Lung cancer treatment is a huge commercial opportunity and AstraZeneca is taking on players like Merck (MRK) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY).""Regardless of these rumors and controversy, I do think it's not an overstatement to say Pascal Soriot's job is on the line with (the trial) because this is make or break for AstraZeneca,"" he said. ""This study is the most important thing for AstraZeneca in the last 10 years.""Though biotech stocks are up 22.5% for the year, there's still room to run, CFRA Research analyst Jeffrey Loo told Investor's Business Daily. Valuations hit historic lows in 2016 amid the presidential election, and are still below both the S&P 500 and the overall health care sector.""Relative to historical valuations, the biotech sector is still attractively priced,"" he said.In late June, the sector got a massive push after President Donald Trump released a draft proposal on drug pricing. The initiative didn't include much to really tug down on drug prices, Loo said. He didn't credit the entire gain to the proposal, but it certainly helped, Loo said.Clinical trials, near-term FDA approvals and strong launch trends have also helped prod the sector this year including the cystic fibrosis news from Vertex, a gene therapy from Novartis (NVS) and a Duchenne muscular dystrophy drug from Sarepta Therapeutics (SRPT).On the latter development, Loncar says Sarepta's $13 million second-quarter sales beat for Exondys 51 could bode well for the broader sector. Sarepta also raised guidance for the year which most analysts have called conservative.""Everybody was watching that for a sign as to how drug launches are going and how payors are pushing back on things,"" he said. ""The fact the launch (of Exondys 51) is going well is a good sign not just for Sarepta, but for all biotech companies.""RELATED:Biotechs Find Strength In Numbers In Treating Multiple SclerosisToo Late To Catch Biotech Rally As Trump Fears Subside?Biotech Rally Gets Second Wind As This Small Cap Nears Break OutWhy The Biotech Rally Could Still Tack On Another 15% Upside

That was the case even though many Fidelity managers sold shares in two tech titans, Microsoft (MSFT) and Apple (AAPL), in the second quarter. Fidelity trimmed its Microsoft share count by 20% compared with its Q1 stake. It peeled Apple back by 6.9%.Microsoft's stock fell 7% in Q2, but has rallied 13% since June 30. No word yet on whether Fidelity resumed buying.Apple's shares sank 12% in Q2, but have rallied 14% since then.In contrast, Fidelity beefed up its shares in home entertainment software stock Activision Blizzard (ATVI) by 92%. ""In Feburary 2016, ATVI completed its purchase of King Digital and reported first and second quarter results ahead of the Capital IQ consensus,"" Rosenbluth reported to clients. On Thursday afternoon shares were about where they closed at the end of Q2.The stock ended June 17% higher than where it began the quarter. It's been about flat since then.In the health care sector, Fidelity was both a net buyer and seller.Fidelity liked the prognosis for biotech firm Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) enough to graft an additional 48% onto its existing share count. That turned out to be a good call. In July, Vertex got FDA approval for a new cystic fibrosis drug, Rosenbluth notes. Now shares are up 15% since the end of Q2.Going in the other director, Fidelity sliced 18% from its Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) stake and 3.8% from its UnitedHealth Group (UNH) holding. Both are about where they ended Q2.In other sectors, Fidelity added to its stakes in cell-tower owner American Tower (AMT), cable provider Charter Communications (CHTR) and carmaker Tesla Motors (TSLA). Fidelity added 20% to its positions in each.American Tower is about where it was on June 30. Charter is up 11%. The stock is seeing solid earnings estimate revision activity from analysts, says Zacks Equity Research. Still, Charter's telecom services-integrated industry group is ranked 66, down from 43 four weeks ago.Tesla is up fractionally from where it closed Q2.Among stocks that Fidelity trimmed in Q2 were Amazon (AMZN), cut by 1.3%, and Visa (V), shaved by 1.9%.Fidelity's largest stock mutual funds continue to hold many of the largest megacap stocks, even those that the fund family as a group trimmed in Q2, Rosenbluth said. The $19.4 billion Blue Chip Growth (FBGRX) has top-10 holdings in Apple and Visa. Other top 10 stocks included Tesla, which the complex added to.Blue Chip Growth is up 1.96% this year going into Thursday, vs. 3.42% for its large-cap growth peers tracked by Morningstar Inc. and 8.29% for the S&P 500.The $7.5 billion Dividend Growth (FDGFX) held trim targets Apple, Johnson & Johnson and Microsoft. Dividend Growth is up 5.02% this year.In separate data, Morningstar Inc. highlights stocks that funds have added to recently. The $109 billion Fidelity Contrafund (FCNTX), managed by Will Danoff since 1990, has interesting adds.Contrafund, which is among the largest stock mutual funds available, has added to B2Gold. The Canadian-based gold producer runs mines globally. As of midday Friday, shares were up 209% so far this year.Earnings per share grew 95%, 69%, 46% and 52% the past four quarters. But note that the shares are trading just above 4 and have never reached 5.Contrafund holds about a dozen mining stocks and has boosted its stakes recently in half of them.Itau Unibanco (ITUB) is another name in which Contrafund has raised its stake. The Brazilian bank holding company's ADRs are up 73% so far this year.EPS has declined for six quarters in a row, but analysts see expect a 4% gain in the current quarter and a 5% increase in 2017.The company has a so-so Composite Rating from IBD of 78. The Composite Rating, which starts at 1 and runs to 99, combines IBD's five performance ratings, including EPS and Relative Price Strength Ratings. Stocks poised to move higher often have a high Comp Rating. You should look for stocks whose rating is 95 or higher, which means that they've outperformed 95% of all other stocks in terms of their Composite Rating.IBD'S TAKE: Alan Elliot explains why a high Comp Rating is not always a buy signal.Itau also has IBD's SMR Rating of B. SMR Ratings of A and B are the best.And Contrafund opened a stake in Applied Materials (AMAT) as of its latest disclosure.EPS went from a 4% decline three quarters ago to 17% and 52% growth in the two most recent frames.That 52% EPS gain was reported for Q3 on Thursday and it topped Wall Street expectations.But Applied's Q3 revenue, up 13%, were slightly below analysts' consensus. The maker of chipmaking equipment posted revenue of $2.82 billion in the period, falling short of Street forecasts. Six analysts surveyed by Zacks expected $2.84 billion.For the current quarter ending in October, Applied Materials expects its per-share earnings to range from 61 cents to 69 cents.The stock gapped up 7% on huge volume Friday. The semiconductor equipment maker's shares are up 58% so far this year.

264,VRTX,"Finding winning stocks poised in pre-sprint mode is not a push-button business. Savvy investors don't rely on any one indicator or tool to say ""Buy this, now.""Trust, as the former President Ronald Reagan said, but verify.Even a top-grade stock must meet all the requirements of a sound investment method before you deploy hard-earned cash. It has to make sense according to what you know about industry leadership, chart analysis and the state of the market.So a broad-based measure, such as IBD's Composite Rating, provides a solid starting point. But keep in mind, it is a starting point only.Introduced on Jan. 31, 2001, Composite Ratings have been flagging top stocks for more than a decade. They are an immense time saver. But don't assume every stock bearing a high Composite rank is ready for purchase.Composite Ratings digest a bundle of IBD SmartSelect Ratings, including EPS Ratings, Relative Price Strength Ratings, SMR Ratings and Accumulation-Distribution grades, into a single, 99 (best) to 1 (worst) scale.IBD'S TAKE: One of the fastest ways to see a stock's rating is by going to IBD Stock Checkup. You can access it via the Research tab at Investors.com.The rating also crunches data for how far a stock is off its 52-week high. The closer to the high, all else being equal, the higher the grade. This factor gets added weight in the stock's rating.Investors trying to determine whether stocks with high Composite Rating are leaders should always start with two basic technical metrics: stock price and average daily trading volume.In the biomedical and biotech industry group, for example, Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) and SciClone Pharmaceuticals (SCLN) both held the best-possible Composite Rating of 99 back in June 2012. Which was the better-quality stock?Both showed strong fundamentals and interesting chart patterns. Both also traded at healthy average daily volumes, above 400,000 shares a day each. But Alexion traded above 90. SciClone had yet to hit 7 a share -- below IBD's 10 minimum for leading stocks.Let's view another pair. Anika Therapeutics (ANIK) and Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) each held a 98 Composite. Again, the rating has guided us to stocks with compelling fundamentals. Pricewise, both were also loosely in target range, although Vertex, near 57, looked stronger than Anika, which traded below 15.The kicker here is average daily trading volume. Anika traded a scant 168,000 shares a day at the time. Vertex saw more than 4 million shares change hands in each trading session. This is a sign of large institutions at work, which is a vital element to great runs by the true market leaders.(Editor's Note: This column was originally published in the June 11, 2012, edition of IBD.

265,VRTX,"Drugmaker Medivation's (MDVN) stock was jumping Monday -- and lifting some other big biotechs with it -- after Pfizer (PFE) announced that it's acquiring the company for $14 billion in cash.The Pfizer-Medivation deal was formally announced after a weekend of leaks and a long campaign by big French pharma Sanofi (SNY) to take over the maker of prostate-cancer drug Xtandi. Sanofi didn't completely rule out making another bid, but its statement on Monday made it sound as though Pfizer's $81.50 a share in cash was too rich for its blood: ""While we recognized the potential strategic benefits of a combination with Medivation, we are first and foremost a disciplined acquirer and remain committed to acting in the best interests of Sanofi shareholders.""Medivation stock rose 20% to 80.42 on the stock market today. Shares of both Pfizer stock fell a fraction Monday.IBD'S TAKE: In the last five weeks, IBD's Medical-Biomed/Biotech Industry Group has risen from No. 126 to No. 36 out of 197 industry groups. This month, IBD looked at what's driving the biotech stock rally.Jefferies analysts noted that this might reignite speculation that Sanofi turn its attention to rare-disease specialist BioMarin Pharmaceutical (BMRN). In June, BioMarin's stock rose on an anonymously sourced report at the blog Betaville that BioMarin was Sanofi's fallback option. On Monday, BioMarin stock popped 6.7% to 98.17.Meanwhile, Incyte (INCY), maker of the blood-cancer drug Jakafi and a perpetual object of buyout speculation with various partners, rose 7.7% to 81.98.In a research note sizing up several biotech buyout targets, BMO Capital Markets analyst Do Kim wrote that Incyte could go for $14.1 billion to $18.8 billion, based on a valuation of three to four times peak sales. While that wouldn't bring much of an upside to its current market cap of $15 billion, Kim added, ""We believe these companies could potentially command a higher multiple, given the limited number of late-stage clinical and commercial biotechs.""Others he named as likely targets include rare-disease players Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) and Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX), which rose 3.3% and 3%, respectively, on Monday.RELATED:

266,VRTX,"Leerink offered a mostly bullish preview of the coming earnings season for big biotechs Wednesday, offering hope for a lagging sector.Analyst Geoffrey Porges raised his Q2 estimates on Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN), Biogen (BIIB), Celgene (CELG), Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN).He wrote that prescription data from IMS Health (IMS) indicates a ""flat to slightly up"" trend over Q1, with Celgene standing out with 62% year-over-year volume growth driven by its new psoriasis drug Otezla. But on top of that, drugmakers evidently shrugged off recent political criticism and raised prices on a number of products.""The WAC (wholesale acquisition cost) price of Celgene's Otezla increased in April by 7.9%, following an 8% raise in January and, before that, an increase of 9.9% last June -- representing a year-over-year cumulative increase of 28%; Celgene also raised the price of Abraxane in April, a 10% year-over-year cumulative increase,"" Porges wrote. ""Other Q2 price increases included: Amgen's Kyprolis (8% YoY); Biogen's Tecfidera (16%), Avonex (16%), and Plegridy (16%); and Medivation's (MDVN) Xtandi (6%).""Leerink nonetheless lowered its estimates for Medivation, based on lower Xtandi sales, as well as a lower royalty on sales outside the U.S. He also modestly lowered his forecasts for Amgen (AMGN) and Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX), though he added that he was still above consensus on both companies.Celgene stock climbed 4.3% to 104.60 on the stock market today. The stock may also have been helped by anonymously sourced reports that it was one of the companies which signed non-disclosure agreements with Medivation ahead of a possible buyout.Regeneron stock climbed 3.3% to 371.57. Alexion advanced 3% to 121.12. Biogen rose 2.3% and Gilead 2.2%.Vertex stock rose 3.6% to 89.66 after it announced a licensing deal with Moderna Therapeutics to develop a cystic-fibrosis treatment using Moderna's messenger RNA technology. Vertex agreed to $20 million in cash and a $20 million investment upfront, with up to $275 million in milestone payments if the drug succeeds.

267,VRTX,"The stock market was mixed with just a few minutes left in Friday's session. Biotechs outperformed with Nasdaq 100 names like BioMarin (BMRN), Biogen (BIIB) and Vertex (VRTX) leading the way.The Nasdaq and S&P 500 eased 0.1%. The Dow Jones industrial average turned up, rising less than 0.1% amid solid showings by General Electric (GE), Boeing (BA) and Caterpillar (CAT). Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq was tracking close to Thursday's levels.Besides biotech, telecom, paper and food stocks outperformed. Retail stocks and online travel firms lagged; the latter hurt by news overnight of a terror attack in Nice, France. Priceline (PCLN), Expedia (EXPE) and TripAdvisor (TRIP) all fell but were near session highs.In economic news, June retail sales came in better than expected. Meanwhile, one day after wholesale prices came in a little hotter than expected, consumer prices rose 0.2% in June, below the consensus estimate of 0.3%. Core prices rose 0.2%, in line with expectations. Core consumer inflation climbed to 2.3%, matching February's peak. It hasn't been higher since September 2008.On the manufacturing front, the New York Fed's Empire State Manufacturing Index softened to 0.55 in July from June's reading of 6.01. Economists expected a reading of 5.0.In the stock market today, Herbalife (HLF) was well off session highs but still rose 10% after the FTC concluded the company is not a pyramid scheme. Pershing Square's Bill Ackman has been a long-time critic of the company while billionaire investor Carl Icahn has defended it.Elsewhere, Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) dropped 3% to 405.34 ahead of its July 21 earnings report after Morgan Stanley downgraded shares and lowered it price target to 405 from 500. Morgan Stanley says it could be years before Chipotle fully recovers from the fallout from food-borne illnesses.Chipotle reports Q2 results on July 21.IBD's TAKE: Signs of institutional selling were apparent in Chipotle late last year. Those who recognized it were able to sell the stock before getting hurt. To learn more about recognizing sell signals in a stock, visit IBD University.Inside the IBD 50, Yirendai (YRD) was by far the best percentage gainer, up 13%. News was hard on Yirendai to come by, but Morgan Stanley brought the China-based lending platform public in December at 10.

268,VRTX,"Biotech stock analysts pondered the potential impact of the Brexit Friday morning, finding that most big U.S. biotechs have low exposure in the U.K. but could run into other headaches.Exposure to the European Union in general ranged from 9% for Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) to 37% for Celgene (CELG), according to Jefferies. Celgene nevertheless told Evercore ISI that less than 1% of its revenue comes from the U.K.Gilead Sciences' (GILD) EU exposure is 19%, while its U.K. exposure is 2.9%, according to Evercore's calculations.Vertex Pharmaceuticals' (VRTX) EU exposure is 29%, with 2.5% in Britain, but RBC Capital Markets notes that's expected to grow as Vertex's latest cystic-fibrosis drug Orkambi is supposed to get reimbursement in the U.K. next year. RBC analyst Michael Yee said in a research note that it's ""not clear whether these (reimbursement) negotiations will be impacted in any way.""However, Edison Investment analyst Maxim Jacobs opined in a research note that these measurements of exposure were ""looking at the wrong kind of risk. The risk is if a global bear market kills biotech funding.""Needham analyst Alan Carr wrote that Britain's separation from the EU will also bring regulatory complications down the road.""The European Medicines Agency (EMA), which conducts a centralized drug review process for Europe, is based in London,"" Carr wrote in a research note. ""If Article 50 (the withdrawal clause) is invoked, the EMA will need to move, and the U.K. will need to establish a new, separate regulatory organization.""Although we do not expect a meaningful impact on companies with drugs now under review by the EMA, Brexit will lead to a less efficient, more expensive, and potentially lengthier regulatory process for companies seeking approval in the EU and U.K.""Biotechs were hammered along with the rest of the market on the stock market today. Celgene fell 4.3% to 96.29, Regeneron was off 4.9% to 339.48 to its lowest level since October 2014. Gilead faltered 3.5% to 80.47, a 2-year low. Vertex shed 7.1% to 81.90. IBD's biotech industry group plunged 4.5%.

269,VRTX,"Stocks upshifted at the starting bell Wednesday, with the Nasdaq out front, up 0.5% in early trade —pressing to new highs and looking to add a ninth day to its recent rally. The S&P 500 took a 0.2% gain and the Dow Jones industrial average, battl;ing a 3% decline by IBM (IBM), clung to very narrow gains.XIBM fell 3%, weighing on the Dow in early action. The in-transition big-tech brand delivered mixed second-quarter results late Tuesday, but management said its restructuring plan was on track, with high levels of R&D investment and a $5 billion share buyback in the first half. IBM shares have been trading sideways since May, 15% below their February high.United Health (UNH) jumped 1%, the strongest early move among Dow industrials. The managed care provider reported second-quarter earnings and revenue above expectations, despite its withdrawal from the independent Affordable Care Act markets, which reduced revenue by $1.9 billion. The gain hoisted shares to a new high above the stock's July 7 peak.Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) led the Nasdaq 100 and the S&P 500, soaring 26% after reporting late Tuesday positive Phase 1 and 2 results of a triple-pill treatment for the genetic conditions causing cystic fibrosis. The stock is up 132% from its December low.Scripps Networks Interactive (SNI) rocketed 19%, Discovery Communications (DISCA) leapt 7% after news reports late Tuesday that the two companies were in talks regarding a possible combination. No numbers were provided, but the two cable content providers carry market values of more than $15 billion (Discovery) and $8.8 billion (Scripp's).Morgan Stanley (MS) bolted more than 3% after reporting second-quarter revenue and earnings above targets. The heavy-volume gain retook a cup-with-handle buy point at 46.08, but the stock remained in the buy range following the breakout.United Airlines (UAL) dropped 4% after its second-quarter results, reported after Tuesday's close. The loss sent shares below support at their 10-week moving average in very heavy trade, a sell signal.Railroad CSX (CSX) slipped 3% after reporting what looked like a strong second-quarter performance late Tuesday. Earnings rose 36%, revenue climbed 8%, both higher than expected and driven by ""coal-related gains,"" according to management. The company reaffirmed its second-quarter earnings guidance, which remains just below consensus views.China's Yirendai (YRD) jumped 3% in powerful trade. The online lending operation cleared a 31.74 buy point in heavy trade on Monday, and ended Tuesday extended 10% above that entry.First Solar (FSLR) spiked 5% after an upgrade to buy, from hold, by Axiom Capital. Shares are now 79% above an April low. Solar stocks have outpaced all other industries by a wide margin over the last four- and eight-week periods.Homebuilders' stocks traded generally higher after the Commerce Department reported a stronger-than-expected rebound in housing starts for June, rising to an annualized rate of 1.215 million starts. That was up from 1.122 million starts in May and above June consensus estimates of 1.122 million.Building permits also jumped, to a rate of 1.254 million, up more than 7% from May's tally and easily clearing consensus views for a pace of 1.206 million starts.The Energy Information Administration reports its weekly crude oil inventories data at 10:30 a.m. ET.RELATED:Vertex Catapults 24% On Strong Trial For Cystic Fibrosis DrugIBM's Sales Woes Continue For Yet Another QuarterQualcomm, ASML To Kick Off Chip Earnings: Investing Action PlanThe Big Picture: Several Tech Groups Fuel Nasdaq's Run To New High

Nasdaq 100 futures climbed 0.3%.Vertex Pharmaceuticals late Tuesday reported strong Phase 1 and 2 results of a triple-pill treatment for cystic fibrosis. Vertex has made cystic fibrosis a long-time focus, but this could be the first treatment for the underlying genetic conditions.Vertex shares skyrocketed 27% to 168 in premarket trading Tuesday. Vertex closed up 2.3% in Tuesday stock market trading.IBD'S TAKE: One way to play biotechs is via ETFs: iShares Nasdaq Biotech (IBB) was in buy range from a breakout almost a month ago. But the ETF, commonly known by its IBB ticker, was rallying late on Vertex's news. Here are a list of several notable biotech ETFs.IBM late Tuesday reported better-than-expected second-quarter earnings. But revenue fell 5%, worse than expected. It was Big Blue's 21st straight quarter of falling revenue vs. a year earlier. Analysts have called IBM's transition to faster-growth, higher-margin software and services ""tedious"" and ""painful.""IBM shares fell 2.9% to 149.60 in premarket action trade, threatening to open Wednesday at a nine-month low.In Asian trading, Japan's Nikkei rose 0.1%, Hong Kong's Hang Seng climbed 0.6% while the Shanghai composite advanced 1.4%. In European trade intraday, the U.K.'s FTSE and Germany's Dax were little change while France's CAC-40 rose 0.2%Looking to Wednesday trading in the U.S., American Express (AXP), chip gear maker ASML Holding (ASML), Morgan Stanley (MS) and Steel Dynamics (STLD) are among the notable earnings on tap.

271,VRTX,"Gilead Sciences (GILD) could fill a hole in its portfolio by acquiring Incyte (INCY), an analyst suggested Friday, offering one caveat — Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) would still be a less risky bet.Though Gilead could make a play now for Incyte — to the tune of a 30%-40% premium on its stock price — the No. 3 biotech would largely be betting on the commercial success of Incyte's immuno-oncology drug, epacadostat. Meanwhile, it's dealing with a slump in its Hepatitis C drug-sales unit.""Much of the value of the acquisition depends on achieving substantial sales (more than $4 billion by 2025) of epacadostat in the highly competitive and somewhat unpredictable world of immuno-oncology,"" Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges wrote in a note to clients.Porges imagines that Gilead could afford to pay $173-$187 a share to acquire Incyte. Earlier this year, Gilead acknowledged that it could be open to a deal, particularly in oncology. Analysts have suggested Incyte, Tesaro (TSRO), Clovis Oncology (CLVS) and Kite Pharma (KITE) as potential targets.Incyte could help fill some gaps in Gilead's portfolio, Porges said. Its flagship product, Jakafi, is approved in a number of blood disorders and regions, and Incyte is also working on its immuno-oncology drug in trials with Dow's Merck (MRK) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY).IBD'S TAKE: Cancer therapies are winning investor approval with Kite Pharma sitting on top of a running streak. Check out the Industry Snapshot for a closer look at which companies might prove to be a strong bet.At a 30%-40% premium to Incyte's stock price, the deal could generate 19% accretion by year five, he said. The transaction could create an 11% rate of return for Gilead shareholders over the next 10 years. These projections are dependent on strong sales for epacadostat.Using a 75% premium model, Gilead's earnings would be dilutive until 2018, with an internal rate of return that's north of 8%.""While both the Vertex and Incyte deals are similar in size, Vertex represents a lower risk but less strategic option for Gilead given the limited (but still substantial) application of Vertex's products and technologies,"" he said.Incyte, on the other hand, offers a high risk/high reward with its epacadostat and broader development portfolio, he wrote.On the stock market today, Gilead fell 1 cent to 70.57. Incyte was up 0.6% to 134.27 and Vertex was up 7 cents to 130.99.RELATED:Are Gilead's Fortunes About To Change — Without An Acquisition?Gilead And Vertex Should Join — But Don't Hold Your Breath: AnalystWhy The Biotech Rally Could Still Tack On Another 15% Upside

Cigarettes, But One Tobacco Giant Is Holding UpThe Federal Reserve kept to Wall Street's preferred script on Wednesday, leaving its key interest rate unchanged and putting off an announcement that it will begin unwinding its $4.5 trillion balance sheet.The Fed's patience comes as the economy is performing pretty well, with real GDP growing at a 2.6% pace in the second quarter, but inflation and wage gains have been more muted than expected. The combination has been good for the stock market, partly because the prospect of low interest rates has weighed on the dollar, which could be a boon to the earnings of U.S. multinationals in the second half of this year.The decision by the Fed to wait until September to announce a shift in its reinvestment policy — a gradual pullback from its current stance of reinvesting all principal from its maturing mortgage and Treasury bond portfolio — also sent a signal that policymakers aren't overly concerned that financial markets are too exuberant.The next interest-rate hike is expected in December. The real uncertainty, hinging on the inflation outlook, is what Fed policy will look like in 2018.A flurry of chip-industry players posted beat-and-raise June-quarter results including chipmakers Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Cypress Semiconductor (CY), Intel (INTC) and Texas Instruments (TXN), as well as chip-gear suppliers Lam Research (LRCX) and Teradyne (TER).AMD earned an adjusted 2 cents a share on sales of $1.22 billion in Q2, when analysts expected it to break even on sales $1.16 billion. In the current quarter, AMD forecasts sales to rise 15%, vs. Wall Street's target of 6%.Cypress earned 21 cents a share ex items on sales of $594 million in Q2, vs. estimates of 16 cents and $547 million. For Q3, Cypress expects to earn 23 cents ex items on sales of $600 million, vs. views of 21 cents and $578 million.Intel earned 72 cents a share ex items on $14.8 billion in sales in Q2, topping views of 68 cents and $14.41 billion. For Q3, Intel forecast adjusted earnings of 80 cents a share on sales of $15.7 billion, when analysts were looking for 74 cents and $15.32 billion.TI earned $1.03 a share ex items on sales of $3.69 billion in the June quarter, vs. analyst expectations for 96 cents and $3.57 billion. For the current quarter, TI expects to earn $1.11 a share on sales of $3.9 billion, vs. Wall Street's targets of $1.05 and $3.8 billion.Lam earned an adjusted $3.11 a share on sales of $2.34 billion in the June quarter. Analysts were expecting $3.03 and $2.32 billion. For the September quarter, Lam expects to earn $3.25 a share on sales of $2.45 billion. Wall Street was modeling $2.76 and $2.18 billion.Teradyne earned 90 cents a share ex items on sales of $697 million in Q2, topping expectations for 86 cents and $684 million. For Q3, Teradyne expects to earn 43 cents a share ex items on sales of $470 million. Analysts had been expecting 39 cents and $457 million.PayPal (PYPL) earnings rose 27% from a year ago, with revenue rising 18% to $3.14 billion, slightly topping consensus estimates. The digital-payment processor, a member of the IBD 50, raised its full-year outlook above analyst views. Shares rose to record highs but pared gains.U.S. crude futures spiked 8.6% to $49.711 a barrel amid signs that supplies are falling and the revived U.S. shale boom may be petering out. Nigeria said it'll eventually join the rest of OPEC in curbing production. Saudi Arabia agreed to cut oil exports. U.S. crude inventories tumbled by 7.2 million barrels and domestic production dipped. Some energy companies trimmed capital-spending plans after months of sub-$50 oil. Halliburton (HAL) warned that it sees U.S. exploration and production companies ""tapping the brakes"" and U.S. rig counts plateauing. Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) earnings missed.General Motors (GM) reported that adjusted profits grew 1.6% to $1.89, beating views for $1.72, while revenue dropped 12.7% to $37 billion, below views for $40.2 billion. GM reaffirmed full-year EPS guidance but will cut second-half production amid swelling inventories and falling U.S. industry sales. Ford Motor (F) topped views and raised guidance, but largely on lower tax rates. GM fell further below a buy point while Ford fell back toward multiyear lows. But Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) held above a buy point after adjusted EPS swelled 49% though sales fell short. Its Maserati luxury brand did well.Biogen (BIIB) obliterated sales expectations for spinal muscular atrophy drug Spinraza with $203 million. Amgen (AMGN), though, fell late Tuesday after its boosted 2017 EPS ex items guide lagged some views. Gilead Sciences (GILD) reported that its hepatitis C drug franchise declined 27.5% but was partially offset by 16.1% growth in HIV and hepatitis B drug sales. Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) said total cystic fibrosis sales gapped up 20.7%. Celgene (CELG) and Alexion (ALXN) also beat views with the latter busting EPS expectations by 30 cents.AstraZeneca (AZN) crashed 15% Thursday after reporting that its Mystic lung cancer trial of an immuno-therapy combination failed. The U.K. drugmaker also announced a deal with Merck (MRK) to gain access to the latter's I-O blockbuster Keytruda. Merck rose 3% on Thursday. Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY), which has had several setbacks for its I-O drug Opdivo, slid 3% on concerns that the Mystic failure bodes ill for a similar Opdivo-combo study.Wall Street soured on casino players like MGM Resorts International (MGM), Wynn Resorts (WYNN) and Melco Resorts & Entertainment (MLCO) as the sector overall put up mixed results and guidance. Concerns about mass-market gaming in Macau weighed on Wynn, whose Q2 results nonetheless beat estimates. MGM offered a weak revenue-per-available-room outlook. It also cited ""higher-than-anticipated disruption"" at the Monte Carlo, which is being revamped into Park MGM, and a ""challenging comparison"" on the Las Vegas Strip in Q3. Las Vegas Sands (LVS) topped; results from Melco and U.S.-focused Boyd Gaming (BYD) and Penn National Gaming (PENN) were mixed.Shares in AT&T (T) and Verizon Communications (VZ) soared after the telecoms reported better-than-expected wireless results amid stiff competition. AT&T narrowed its losses of high-spending postpaid phone subscribers while Verizon added more than forecast. AT&T says its strategy of packaging video and wireless services is jelling. Verizon says consumers are willing to pay a premium for its unlimited data services because of its high-performing network.Comcast (CMCSA) reported second-quarter profit and revenue that topped estimates, as NBCUniversal's filmed-entertainment business delivered strong box office results, but video subscriber losses were higher than expected. Citigroup speculated that Comcast could acquire Verizon. Charter Communications (CHTR) missed on earnings and sales, but shares soared amid speculation that it could be acquired as well.McDonald's (MCD) Q2 earnings and same-store sales topped estimates, helped by cheap drink offerings and ""premium"" menu items. Chipotle (CMG) is testing queso but faced concerns that its sales recovery had stumbled following a food-borne illness scare that began in 2015; the sales impact from reports of customers who fell ill in July remained unclear. Domino's Pizza (DPZ) crashed in part on disappointing Q2 international comps, lower margins, an EPS helped by the tax rate and an already-high stock valuation. Starbucks (SBUX) tumbled after fiscal-Q3 same-store sales and revenue missed; EPS matched views. The coffee chain said it would close all 379 Teavana retail stores.Several industrial Dow giants rolled past Q2 estimates Tuesday thanks in part to improved global growth. Caterpillar (CAT) surged to a 52-week high after the company saw EPS of $1.49, up 36.7%, on revenue of $11.33 billion, up 9.6%. United Technologies (UTX) saw earnings climb 1.6% to $1.85 per share on a 2.7% revenue rise to $15.28 billion. Shares tumbled to their lowest level since May despite raised full-year EPS and revenue guidance. DuPont (DD) also beat on the top and bottom lines. Their Dow peer 3M (MMM) was an outlier with an overall miss, and shares tanked.Proofpoint (PFPT) reported Q2 profit and revenue that topped expectations and forecast current quarter sales and earnings just above consensus estimates. Sunnyvale, Calif.-based Proofpoint specializes in email and data-loss protection for corporate networks and cloud-computing infrastructure. Proofpoint rose modestly Friday morning. Fortinet (FTNT) posted mixed Q2 results that beat on EPS and revenue, but billings growth disappointed. The outlook for providers of computer-security software has yet to improve despite recent  ransomware attacks. Fortinet shares tumbled.TAL Education (TAL) topped earnings and sales estimates, as per-share profit of 43 cents and revenue of $321.9 million came out ahead of forecasts for 28 cents and $307.8 million. For the current quarter, the China-based education company sees revenue of $428.4 million to $433.8 million, above views for $424.8 million, per Yahoo Finance estimates. Meanwhile, peer New Oriental Education (EDU) also pulled ahead of forecasts with 41 cents EPS and $486.4 million, in addition to a 36.9% bump in total student enrollments; the midpoint of Q1 revenue guidance pulled just ahead of current views. TAL and New Oriental shares rose 4.8% and 0.9%, respectively,  but the latter's breakout failed Thursday.Mastercard (MA) reported better-than-expected second-quarter earnings and revenue. Shares reversed modestly lower from a record high but remained in buy range.Baidu (BIDU) earnings rose 143%, well over views, while revenue climbed 14% to an in-line $3.08 billion. Shares of the Chinese search giant rose 9.45% on Friday.Electronic Arts (EA) reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings, but the video game publisher gave cautious revenue guidance. EA shares rose Friday after briefly falling below a recent buy point.

273,VRTX,"The Dow Jones industrial average was in the driver's seat again for the second straight session Wednesday, helped by a strong move by shares of Boeing (BA).The maker of commercial and military aircraft soared 9% after the company topped earnings estimates, while raising its full-year earnings and cash flow guidance.XBoeing was well-extended from a proper buy point headed into earnings. In fact, its rally has been so strong, it triggered an IBD sell rule that says to generally take profits in a stock when the gain hits 20%. The rule is there because after a stock rallies 20% past a buy point, it's usually around the time it starts to pull back in price and build a new base.With about one hour remaining in the session, the Dow was up 0.5%; the while the Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 added 0.1% each. Small caps lagged after a solid performance Wednesday, falling 0.3%. Volume was lower on the NYSE and slightly higher on the Nasdaq.The two-day FOMC ended today. The decision to keep interest rates steady at 1% to 1.25% was unanimous, and the Fed said the process of selling bonds to shrink its bloated $4.5 trillion balance sheet will begin ""relatively soon,"" perhaps as early as the September meeting.In the stock market today, technical breakouts for Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Texas Instruments (TXN) looked good for a while but faded.AMD gapped up over a 14.77 buy point, rising 5% to 14.81, but the stock was near its session low after early strength. Ditto with Texas Instruments. Shares broke out early over an 82.91 buy point, but the stock was recently trading around 82.45, up 1%.Advanced Micro has the look of a turnaround story after the company reported its fourth straight quarter of double-digit sales growth. Nvidia is a daunting competitor for AMD, but AMD's graphics cards for gaming continue to see strong demand, and the company is making inroads in the nascent field of artificial intelligence.Inside the IBD 50, China-based education stocks saw the most interest. TAL Education (TAL) jumped nearly 4% to 149.71 ahead of its earnings report Thursday after the close. New Oriental Education (EDU) gained 3% to 83.04, following through nicely after Wednesday's upside reversal. New Oriental is still in buy range from an 82.72 cup-with-handle buy point.September West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures rose almost 2% to 48.75, after data showed domestic crude supplies falling by 7.2 million barrels in the latest week, more than expected, and the fourth straight weekly drawdown.Watch for earnings reports after the close from solid performers like Fortinet (FTNT), Facebook (FB), ServiceNow (NOW) and and Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX), among others.RELATED:The Fed Leaves Balance Sheet Unchanged, Will Act 'Relatively Soon'Here Are Key Areas To Focus On When Facebook Reports Earnings
"
274,VRTX,"Futures for the S&P 500 index, Nasdaq 100 and Dow Jones industrial average edged higher early Wednesday ahead of a new wave of big earnings and the Federal Reserve's latest policy announcement.Strong results late Tuesday from Texas Instruments (TXN) and AT&T (T), are good news for Apple (AAPL) and the iPhone ecosystem ahead of Apple's own earnings. Meanwhile, Facebook (FB) and PayPal (PYPL) are among four IBD 50 stocks with earnings due Wednesday, with Facebook providing further evidence that is beating back Snapchat operator Snap (SNAP).XThe Dow industrials rose 0.5% in Tuesday's regular session, led by earnings from Caterpillar (CAT) and McDonald's (MCD) as well as strength in financials. The Nasdaq composite, weighed down by Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL), closed just above break-even, but did hit a new all-time high. The S&P 500 index rose 0.3% to a fresh record.Meanwhile, the CBOE Volatility Index, or VIX, hit yet another record intraday low on Tuesday. VIX lows are a sign of investor complacency and often associated with at least short-term market tops.Still, S&P 500 and Dow futures rose 0.1% vs. fair value and Nasdaq 100 futures 0.2% as equities generally advanced across the globe. Crude oil prices continued to climb after big gains Tuesday.The Fed is not expected to make any policy changes Wednesday afternoon, though policymakers could surprise and announce a plan to let the central bank's $4.5 trillion balance sheet start to decline. Most analysts see that shift happening at the September meeting.President Trump told the Wall Street Journal that Apple will build three plants in the U.S. Trump has made similar statements before. Apple had no comment Tuesday. U.S. operations would ease political pressures, but would likely be more expensive. It's possible that Foxconn, a key assembler of iPhones, could set up some plant in America.IBD'S TAKE: Buying or holding a stock can be risky heading into an earnings report. Here's an earnings options strategy that can help you cash in on post-earnings stock gains, while minimizing the risk from a weak quarter. That options strategy is highlighted in IBD's weekly Earnings Preview column.Meanwhile, Texas Instruments reported better-than-expected earnings late Tuesday and gave bullish guidance. Texas Instruments is big in automotive chips and many other segments, as well as in mobile devices like the Apple iPhone. But TI follows a beat-and-raise last week from Skyworks Solutions (SWKS), another Apple iPhone chipmaker and an IBD 50 member.AT&T reported better-than-expected wireless subscriber figures, while churn hit a record low. That's a good sign for Apple iPhone sales during what could be a spring lull ahead of the iPhone 8 later this year. Relatively strong iPhone 7 demand is key, given the likelihood that the next-generation iPhone will be delayed.Apple shares edged higher in premarket trading. Apple closed up 0.4% to 152.73 in Tuesday's stock market trading. Apple is approaching a 156.75 flat-base buy point.Facebook, PayPal, Lam Research (LRCX) and Edwards Lifesciences (EW) are IBD 50 stocks reporting earnings on Wednesday. Also, Facebook, PayPal and Lam Research all boast a best-possible 99 Composite Rating, which means they outperform 99% of all other stocks based on proprietary fundamental and technical ratings. Big stock winners often have Composite Ratings of at least 95 near the start of their big price runs.Facebook will be the third FANG (Facebook, Amazon.com (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Google-parent Alphabet) stock to report Q2 results, following Alphabet late Monday and Netflix last week. Amazon is set to close out FANG earnings on Thursday.Facebook will presumably provide some new figures about the growing popularity of Instagram Stories and other offerings that clone Snapchat features. But here's a stat that's already out. Since Snap's March 1 IPO, Facebook's market capitalization has increased by about $81 billion to $479 billion. Snap's market value has retreated to just $16.4 billion. So Facebook has added the equivalent of nearly five Snapchats in Snap's brief history as a public firm.Facebook dipped 0.4% to 165.28 in Tuesday stock market trading after hitting a fresh record high on Monday. Facebook is extended from any possible entry. Snap fell 1.35% to 13.89, hitting a new record low.PayPal dipped 0.55% to 58.26, just beyond the 5% chase zone from a 55.24 flat-base buy point cleared earlier this month. The mobile payments firm expanded its reach via deals this month with Apple and JPMorgan Chase (JPM).Chip-equipment maker Lam Research is in cup base just below a possible buy point. Edwards Lifesciences has fallen back below a buy point in a big cup-with-handle base, undercutting its 50-day line on Tuesday.Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX), D.R. Horton (DHI), ServiceNow (NOW) and Fortinet (FTNT) are among the many other top-rated stocks set to report earnings Wednesday.RELATED:Texas Instruments, AMD Beat Q2 Targets, Guide HigherAT&T Q2 Adjusted Profit Beats, Pay-TV Video Subscribers FallWill Facebook Earnings Support Its Strong Stock Growth?The Big Picture: Nasdaq Lags On Alphabet Loss, But Industrials, Financials LeadHow To Win With Growth Stocks Like Netflix, Nvidia During Earnings

275,VRTX,"A pair of Nasdaq 100 tracking funds are near their respective buy points as the tech-heavy index climbed to a new high Monday.PowerShares QQQ Trust (QQQ) is in buy range after rising past a 144 entry last week. The ETF rallied 20% from a prior flat-base breakout in December to the start of the pattern it just cleared. It pulled back to and rebounded off its 50-day moving average in mid-April, setting up another buy opportunity.XThe fund, which has attracted $55.4 billion since its March 1999 launch, was 56% weighted in technology as of July 20. Consumer cyclical contributed 17% and health care, 11%. The top five holdings — Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon.com (AMZN), Facebook (FB) and Alphabet (GOOGL) — accounted for nearly 38% of assets.Apple, which regained its 50-day line last week, has rallied more than 30% this year. The iPhone maker reports fiscal Q3 results Aug. 1 after the close. It's expected to launch its upcoming iPhone 8 this year.QQQ gained 22.2% this year through July 21, and 19%, 12.2% and 13.5% for the respective five-, 10- and 15-year periods, according to Morningstar Inc. The S&P 500 has returned 11.2% YTD and 15.1%, 7.2% and 9.6% for the same timeframe. The ETF carries a 0.20% expense ratio.First Trust Nasdaq-100 Equal Weighted Index Fund (QQEW), as the name suggests, is an equal-weighted play on the Nasdaq 100. It tracks the Nasdaq 100 Equal Weighted Index, which is rebalanced every quarter. The index is reconstituted in December but may be updated during the year to reflect replacements in the Nasdaq 100 index.Four of the fund's top five holdings were biotechs: Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX), Gilead Sciences (GILD), Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) and Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN). Netflix (NFLX) was the other stock.The $560.9 million fund has also outpaced the S&P 500 with a YTD return of 19.9%, five-year 18.7% and 10-year 9.7%, according to Morningstar. QQEW, launched in April 2006, is trading just below a 55.30 buy point of a flat base. Its expense ratio is 0.60%.Both of Friday's ETF picks pulled back slightly but remain near their respective buy points. First Trust Europe AlphaDEX (FEP) is just below a 36.03 flat-base entry and WisdomTree Europe Small Cap Dividend (DFE) is 1% shy of a 66.98 flat-base buy point.Banks, homebuilders and retail were among winning sectors early Tuesday, while utilities, tech and health care lagged. SPDR S&P Retail (XRT) rebounded 2.5% to regain its 50-day line. Component stock Barnes & Noble (BKS) gapped up and soared 14% amid speculation it may put itself up for sale.Among key index funds, SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average (DIA) gained 0.5% and SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) added 0.3%. PowerShares QQQ Trust (QQQ) was fractionally lower and remains above a 144 flat-base buy point.SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production (XOP) leapt 3%, retaking its 50-day line, where it's hit resistance since late January.

West Texas intermediate crude prices surged 3% to $47.68 a barrel.Gold plays were mixed as gold futures slipped 0.3% to $1,251.50 an ounce. VanEck Vectors Gold Miners (GDX) advanced 1.2% but VanEck Vectors Junior Gold Miners (GDXJ) dipped 0.1%; iShare Gold Trust (IAU) and SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) were down 0.4% and 0.3%, respectively.RELATED:Retail Slips, But These 2 Sectors Gain; 2 Top Funds Near Buy Point2 Top Growth Plays In Buy Range; Gold Leads SectorsApple iPhone 8 Launch Timing, Initial Supply Subject Of Debates

276,VRTX,"The Treasury Department's annual financial review of Medicare found that its growth rate won't trigger a cost-cutting panel this week, sending drug stocks higher Wednesday.Ahead of the report on Tuesday, speculation had broken out that growth could be high enough to trigger an Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB) to come up with ways to cut spending. The Brookings Institution had scheduled an event Thursday to discuss the issue.""Last year's report projected that the hospital insurance trust fund would be depleted by 2030 -- just 14 years from now,"" Brookings' website said. ""The report also predicted a more immediate and controversial event: The Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB), famously nicknamed 'death panels,' would be required to submit proposals to reduce Medicare spending in 2018, with the reductions taking place in 2019.""The report of the Medicare Board of Trustees actually moved the depletion date two years earlier, but it said that there still wasn't enough growth in costs to trigger an IPAB. That seemed to turn around the major medical groups: biotech stocks had headed south Tuesday afternoon, but after the mid-morning announcement IBD's Medical-Biotech group rose 1.35%. The Ethical Drugs group was up 0.6%.Even if an IPAB had been triggered, analysts doubted the impact would have been that big, given the restrictions on the sort of cuts the panel could make. Late Tuesday, RBC Capital Markets' Michael Yee ran the numbers:""We note 8 million to 10 million 'dual eligibles' added to 50 million 60 million Medicaid patients, thus growing by 20%,"" Yee wrote in his research note. ""Taking Amgen (AMGN), Biogen (BIIB), Celgene (CELG), Gilead Sciences (GILD), Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN), Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) Medicaid exposure (10-20%) and growing it by 20% to get the larger Medicaid '23% rebate,' our calculations show that this would change revenues by no more than 1% or so if this happened.""Celgene stock, which fell 2.5% in heavy trading Tuesday, rose more than 3% intraday, closing 2.45% at 99.23 on the stock market today. Regeneron stock climbed 4% intraday, setting for a 2% rise to 351.92 after dropping 2.1% Tuesday. Amgen and Biogen shares rose fractionally after both sank nearly 1% Tuesday.Despite the timing of it all, though, hedge fund manager Leonard Yaffe wasn't convinced that the IPAB business was the actual reason for the stock moves, as biotechs had been trending downward since early June.""The rebound in biopharma stocks today is much more than offsetting the concerns mentioned yesterday, as well as the likelihood of fund redemptions; the stocks had become very attractive, and the prospects for several companies are bright,"" Yaffe wrote in an email.

277,VRTX,"Drug pricing was on Wall Street's mind again Friday, as Wells Fargo tapped Mylan (MYL) as the next target for activists, while RBC considered the impact of a potential new law limiting prices in California.Wells Fargo analyst David Maris wrote that after Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX) and Turing Pharmaceuticals were hauled in front of Congress and scrutinized by the press for their policies of drastically hiking the prices of recently acquired drugs, he's been keeping an eye out for other companies in his universe that have been doing a lot of price increases.""In the last six months, Mylan has raised prices more than 20% on 24 products, and more than 100% on seven products,"" Maris wrote in his research note late Thursday. ""Mylan has taken some exceptionally large price increases in 2016, including a 542% increase for ursodiol, a generic medication used to treat gallstones; a 444% increase in metoclopramide, a generic medication commonly used to treat gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and gastroparesis; and a 400% increase in dicyclomine, a medication used to treat irritable bowel syndrome.""Maris added that last month Mylan added 15% to the price tag of its biggest product, which contributed 11% of revenue in the most recent quarter. ""We believe that given the regulatory environment, these pricing actions could bring greater regulatory scrutiny and headline risk. Additionally, we wonder if aggressive price increases are being used to make EPS targets or to offset disappointing sales in other areas.""Mylan responded with the following statement:""Mylan has always been known to have one of the industry's broadest and most globally diversified business models and portfolios, which we have successfully managed by balancing numerous variables, including the natural price reductions that have always been inherent to the generics industry. A flawed analysis focusing on a small number of products out of the more than 1,400 products Mylan sells globally and the approx. 600 products we sell in North America is simply self-serving and misleading to investors. This is especially true given that these generic products represent an extremely small percentage of Mylan's approx. $4 billion North American generics business. Mylan's business model is not today, nor has it ever been, premised on price hikes.""Mylan stock fell 2.7% to 44.53 on the stock market today after falling as low as 43. Valeant retreated 5.3% Friday and 16.4% for the week.RBC Capital Markets biotech analyst Michael Yee was also pondering drug pricing Friday as he calculated the potential impact of the California Drug Price Relief Act (CDPRA) on the stocks in his universe, which include Amgen (AMGN), Gilead Sciences (GILD), Celgene (CELG), Biogen (BIIB) and Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX).The CDPRA, which goes up for popular vote under California's proposition system this November, would require state health care payers like MediCal to buy drugs at similar prices to the Veterans Administration, which usually obtains large discounts.""We believe CDPRA creates a slippery slope: The measure would encourage other states to follow suit (e.g. Ohio has also proposed it and is getting signatures),"" Yee wrote. ""But we think such attempts to reduce drug costs would merely prompt drug makers to just raise VA drug prices, thus helping less people and not resulting in any real savings benefits.""Nonetheless, Yee estimated that if similar laws passed in all 50 states, it could shave 2% to 3% off the annual EPS of his covered companies. ""Our discussions with large-cap biotech companies suggest firms are aware and wouldn't be surprised if the proposal passed, so we note investors should at the very least be informed of the potential headline and model pricing risks,"" he wrote.Drug stocks were down Friday along with the rest of the market. Amgen fell 1.3%, Gilead 1.5%, Biogen 1.7% and Celgene 3%, and Vertex Pharma dipped 1.1%.

278,VRTX,"Most stock mutual funds in May extended the rally that began in March. And some strategists are figuring ways to deal with expected stock market headwinds in the summer months.The average diversified U.S. stock fund in May rose 1.55% vs. setbacks in January and February, followed by a 6.50% rally in March and a 0.48% inch-up in April, leaving it 1.92% higher year to date. By comparison, the S&P 500 advanced 1.80% in May.Going forward, most investors who spoke with IBD expect market volatility into the summer. But they're ready.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Six-Month LeadersLew Piantedosi, manager of four Eaton Vance mutual funds with total assets of $1.2 billion, has a guardedly optimistic, glass-half-full outlook. ""We believe in a core portfolio of secular growers,"" he said. ""Those include names like Amazon (AMZN), Facebook (FB) and Alphabet (GOOGL).""Another such name he likes is NXP Semiconductors (NXPI). ""They provide semiconductor content to the automobile and industrial spaces,"" said Piantedosi, who is a manager of Focused Growth (ELCIX), Focused Growth Opportunities (EIFGX), Tax-Managed Growth (EITGX) and Tax-Managed Multi-Cap Growth (EACPX). ""There's a huge secular shift in those areas toward automation and other new technologies that are driving demand for new semiconductor content.""He added, ""In cars, the new features include crash avoidance, music, rear-view cameras, driver-assisted sensors, other safety systems and an overall trend toward electrical vehicles."" In industrial products, there's a comparable shift into robotics and other forms of automation, he said. ""In both areas, NXP is a leading provider,"" he said.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Category PerformanceAmong more cautious investors, with a glass-half-empty view, is James Wong, lead manager of $716 million Payden Equity Income Fund (PYVLX). ""I'm bracing for volatility,"" he said. ""We're entering the summer, when it does not take a lot of bad news to move the market. So, because I'm an equity income investor, I will drink my own Kool-Aid and say investors would be served well by focusing on companies that continue to provide income in a low-volatility manner.""Theme-parks operator Six Flags Entertainment (SIX) is the sort of stock he likes right now. ""They came out of bankruptcy at the start of this decade,"" Wong said. ""They're improving their revenue stream. Management has improved the quality of their parks and introduced new rides. They've increased membership rates, which means people go more often and spend more money. And they've introduced go-to-the-front-of-the-line passes that people gobble up.""The changes have helped. ""They've improved their recurring-revenue model,"" Wong said. ""So they're a steady-cash-generating company, able to maintain and grow their 4% dividend yield.""The market notched a modest gain in May because investors were emboldened by stock market news that turned out to be less scary than they had feared at the month's outset, Wong said.""Earnings season was negative, but not as bad as people had expected,"" Wong said. The prospect of a ""Brexit"" -- a U.K. exit from the European Union -- faded slightly, he added. And the price of oil rose, from just under $46 a barrel on April 29 to just over $49 on May 31.In addition, many investors grew more comfortable with the prospect of an interest-rate hike as soon as June or July.Small-cap growth funds led by tacking on 2.46% in May.Science and technology funds paced sectors by jumping 4.83%. ""When investors are optimistic, they gravitate toward growthier areas of the market,"" Piantedosi said. ""That's tech.""World equity funds fared far worse, losing 0.35%.Japanese funds did best abroad, gaining 2.38%.Taxable bond funds lost 0.14%. U.S. Treasury funds edged up 0.19%. Tax-exempt funds gained 0.55%.May capped a streak of three months in a row of market gains. ""The fear that dominated at the start of the year kept fading in May,"" Piantedosi said.He added, ""U.S. consumers have been strong. Housing was robust. Europe was looking better.""In the near term, investors will focus on day-to-day events such as the Brexit decision, Federal Reserve meetings, November's U.S. elections, monthly jobless reports and the monthly Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), an indicator of the health of the manufacturing sector.Amid all of that noise, remember that the Fed will raise rates because it sees signs of a strengthening U.S. economy. ""And that should help corporate earnings,"" said Karyn Cavanaugh, the senior market strategist for Voya Investment Management and a member of its multiasset strategies and solutions group. ""At the end of the day, stock buying boils down to buying corporate earnings.""Cavanaugh expects an uptick in corporate earnings in Q3 and Q4. Still, if that fails to occur, don't expect U.S. consumer spending to stay strong, warned Cavanaugh, who is also a manager of $39 million Voya Global Perspectives (IWPVX).Wong, for one, says the market's winning streak is likely to end. Valuations are high and earnings growth is weak, he noted.Piantedosi expects disruptive innovators to continue to grab market share. So he likes Amazon instead of brick-and-mortar department stores. Macy's (M), Dillard's (DDS) and Kohl's (KSS) all reported lower quarterly earnings per share in May. All suffered stock-price declines.Amazon reported a 992% EPS gain in April, accelerating from 122% and 118% in the prior two frames. Shares gained 10% in May.He likes Facebook and Google for similar reasons. ""The huge shift continues in advertising (spending) from traditional media to online and social media,"" he said.Ditto for health care. Despite political talk about potential drug-price regulation, he's bullish in the long term on big-cap biotechs like Gilead Sciences (GILD), Celgene (CELG) and Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX). ""Who knows how the pricing issue will shake out,"" he said. ""But there's plenty of growth in these companies as they continue to innovate.""Piantedosi is not confining bets to high-flyers. ""In any diversified portfolio, you don't want to be pedal-to-the-metal at all times,"" he said. ""Some names in consumer staples, while not cheap, provide stability and predictability and yield.""Philip Morris International (PM) is a favorite. He said, ""It is 100% focused overseas, where the anti-smoking headwind is less than in the U.S. It has a lot of pricing power. The currency headwind is (diminishing) and likely to turn to a tailwind.""Its dividend yield is 4.1%.Pinnacle Foods (PF) is another he likes. ""It's a nice Steady Eddie food company with decent growth characteristics in a food group that doesn't show great characteristics,"" he said.Pinnacle's dividend yield is 2.4%.

But Whirlpool (WHR) and major sellers of appliances Home Depot, Lowe's (LOW) and Best Buy (BBY) were hit. Home improvement chains Home Depot and Lowe's had been seen as Amazon-proof, or at least Amazon-resistant. Best Buy, which has bounced back in recent years from Amazon's initial onslaught, was hurt earlier this month on news that Amazon is creating a Geek Squad rival.Amazon appears to be getting more government attention as its size and scope grow, with an FTC probe and antitrust rumblings.Software giant Microsoft earned 98 cents excluding items for the June fiscal fourth quarter, up 42% year over year and well above views for 71 cents. Revenue rose 9% to $24.7 billion after forecasts for $24.27 billion. Microsoft credited demand for cloud-computing services like Azure and Office 365 as well as its acquisition of LinkedIn.

Honeywell shares rose Friday, retaking a buy point.RELATED:General Electric Stock Dives On Earnings OutlookAmerican Express beat on the top and bottom lines, though provisions for losses jumped 26% due to loan-portfolio growth and a rise in the rate for lending write-offs. Visa earnings also topped, with strong cross-border travel – helped by the stronger dollar – and global payment volumes driving results, according to Mizuho analyst Thomas McCrohan. The company also hiked its full-year revenue growth outlook above views. Visa and American Express, both Dow components, rose 2.8% and 0.4%, respectively, with both still in buy range.TD Ameritrade (AMTD) stock broke out from a long consolidation on July 18 as the online broker beat on both the top and bottom lines, even as industry trading fees for stocks and ETFs have plunged this year.

Weaker trading and net-interest income also hurt Bank of America (BAC), though Fed rate hikes have helped the bank and it said it expected net-interest income to rise in Q3. Morgan Stanley (MS) reported that trading revenue fell, but less so than rivals. JPMorgan (JPM) and Citigroup (C) have also signaled caution amid slow loan growth and longer-term bond yields, which can indicate flagging confidence over the chances for long-term economic gains. Morgan Stanley cleared a buy point while Goldman undercut its 50-day and 200-day moving averages.Check Point Software (CHKP) reported better-than-expected second-quarter earnings on Thursday, but gave weak guidance for the current Q3.

284,VRTX,"Gilead Sciences (GILD) would be better off acquiring Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) than an oncology asset like Tesaro (TSRO) or Incyte (INCY), an analyst suggested Friday as he lamented Gilead's cautious approach to mergers.XThe No. 3 biotech by market cap has shown interest in making an oncology-centric buy as it struggles with declining hepatitis C drug sales. The hepatitis C franchise brought in north of $44 billion over three years, but fell in 2016 for the first time.Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges says Gilead should turn away from the obvious cancer biotech buys — Tesaro, Incyte, Clovis Oncology (CLVS) or Kite Pharma (KITE) — and instead set its sights on Vertex. But, he said, it's likely Gilead will ignore that advice.""We would view an acquisition of a growing and largely de-risked revenue stream, such as Vertex, much more positively than a comparable investment, or set of investments, into the intensely competitive and technologically uncertain field of oncology,"" he said.Vertex would offer Gilead a rare disease portfolio and a robust pipeline. Vertex is now working on a triple-pill combination to treat cystic fibrosis, a lung disease. It's about a year ahead of its nearest rivals, Galapagos (GLPG)/AbbVie (ABBV), and the regimen looks likely to launch in 2020.Gilead has $32 billion in cash, meaning the company wouldn't have to stretch too much to make a transformational acquisition, Porges said. Vertex has a market cap of about $32 billion to Gilead's $92.4 billion market cap.Porges expects Gilead could pay up to $230 per share of Vertex stock and still make the acquisition accretive by year two with realistic synergies. Together with Vertex, Gilead could feasibly expand growth to 11 to 13 times that of slow-growing major pharmas.IBD'S TAKE: Big biotechs like Gilead struggled in the recent biotech rally. Instead, analysts say, keep your eyes on the biotechs highlighted in this Industry Snapshot.With Vertex in tow, Gilead could reverse its revenue trajectory from a projected decline to a 1.9% compound annual growth rate from 2017-22. The transaction would similarly improve an expected fractional decline in earnings to an estimated 5.2% growth rate over those years.But it's more likely Gilead will make a series of small transactions for relatively early-stage assets, Porges said in his note to clients. Those won't be enough to diversify Gilead from the hepatitis C ""roller coaster"" even with the help of its nascent HIV drug bictegravir.""It has been apparent that Gilead would need major acquisitions since 2015, and possibly even before then, and it is inexplicable to us that the company has been so faint-hearted in exercising their cash-flow advantage until now,"" he said. ""The company still appears to be responding to opportunities presented to them, rather than initiating and creating opportunities ahead of their availability.""Even if Gilead went after any of the obvious oncology assets, investors will question why the company is paying a premium today when the potential of those companies was apparent last year when prices were 25% to 500% below their current levels.Porges has a market perform rating and 74 price target on Gilead stock. Its valuation, he says, is at an all-time low and would otherwise justify a recommendation. But ""substantial termination uncertainty makes it hard for us to see the stock recovering its multiple in the foreseeable future.""By the closing bell on the stock market today, Gilead stock dipped a fraction, near 70.78. Vertex popped as much as 4%, though settled to be up 1.3% to 128.87. Incyte stock fell 2.2% to 125.91, while Tesaro stock lost 0.8% to 139.86.RELATED:Why The Biotech Rally Could Still Tack On Another 15% UpsideAre Sanofi, Gilead In A Bidding War Over This Small-Cap BiotechEven An Upgrade Couldn't Save Vertex From The Biotech Deluge

Turnover in the fund tends to run fairly low, at about 29%.There are high barriers to entry in the biotech field, including expertise, capital and regulatory hurdles, Kaul points out. ""But when you do get a major breakthrough in a medication, you really improve people's lives and help save costs for the health care system.""How does Kaul pick stocks for the fund?""You have to understand the management and what is the track record of success,"" he said.

292,VRTX,"Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) and Gilead Sciences (GILD) are most likely to beat Wall Street views for June quarter sales and profits, an analyst said Monday.XLeerink analyst Geoffrey Porges says the ""stars align for widespread beats in Q2 biopharma results."" Among large caps, he also sees AbbVie (ABBV), Celgene (CELG), Biogen (BIIB) and Gilead as most likely to top revenue expectations.Quarter over quarter, though, sales from AbbVie, Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN), Biogen and Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) are likely to be slow, he said.""Both AbbVie and Biogen are facing competition and pricing pressures, while Alexion and Vertex are still high-growth companies with temporary slowing in their revenue growth trajectory pending new indications, formulations or products,"" he wrote in a note to clients.Health tracker IMS sees AbbVie's leukemia drug Imbruvica and testosterone gel AndroGel as likely to come in materially north of the consensus, with immunosuppressant Humira landing about 0.6% above Street views. But other major projects are expected to miss.IMS data suggest Biogen's multiple-sclerosis drugs Tysabri and Tecfidera could beat Porges' estimates by 18.2% and 1.8%, respectively. Tecfidera, however, is expected to miss the Street by 1.3% and MS drugs Plegridy and Avonex are forecast to be light.This comes amid growing competition in the MS field from the likes of Roche (RHHBY), Novartis (NVS) and Sanofi (SNY). Roche's drug, Ocrevus, was approved earlier this year to treat both relapsing-remitting as well as primary progressive MS — a first for the industry.IBD'S TAKE: Biotech stocks are ranked No. 6 out of 197 groups tracked, as sentiment ticks up ahead of the second-quarter earnings season. Make sure to bookmark IBD's Biotech Stocks To Watch And Pharma Industry News for the latest on the sector.Major drugs from Celgene are expected to top the consensus by 4.9% with chemotherapy Revlimid likely to come in 5.1% above the consensus, Porges wrote. Pomalyst, a drug to treat a blood cancer, is expected to be 5.8% higher than the consensus.Gilead is likely to be the biggest second-quarter surprise. Per IMS data, Gilead's sales could top by 10%, ""though this is largely dependent upon the reliability of recent hepatitis C data, which have been unreliable in the past."" Hepatitis C drug sales toppled in 2016 amid high cure rates.Without accounting for highly variable sales of hepatitis C drugs, Gilead's total sales would miss Porges' forecast by 0.1% and the analyst consensus target by 1.7%. At the same time, Gilead's Genvoya, an HIV drug, could beat the consensus by 7%-9%, Porges wrote in a note to clients.Amgen (AMGN) is most likely to match or slightly underperform the consensus, Porges said. Rheumatoid arthritis drug Enbrel is expected to be in line with consensus views, though it could top Porges' view by as much as 1.9%, per IMS data.Bone health drug Prolia and bone marrow stimulating Aranesp are projected to beat by 6%-7%, which could help offset expected sales misses by bone health drug Xgeva and other bone marrow stimulant drugs, Porges said.""However, the changing price dynamic for many of Amgen's products makes the IMS adjustment factors less reliable,"" Porges wrote. He calls for Amgen to hike some of its prices in July after bumping the price of cancer drug Kyprolis by 3.9% in April.On the adjusted profits per share side, Gilead has a chance to beat consensus views by 11.1%, Porges said. Regeneron and Vertex could also top expectations by 8.1% and 7%, respectively.But Biogen could miss earnings views by 10.6% due to a one-time research-and-development expense not fully recognized across analysts' estimates, Porges said. AbbVie, too, is likely to miss adjusted earnings per share by 3.2%, he said.In afternoon trading on the stock market today, IBD's Medical-Biomed/Biotech group was down fractionally.RELATED:Could Q2 Surprise Spike This Beleaguered Biotech's Stock?Gilead Could Acquire This Biotech — But Vertex Is Still Better: AnalystWhy This Biotech Could Be Poised For A Run After Toppling 52% In June

294,VRTX,"A key hepatitis C drug from Gilead Sciences (GILD) could top Wall Street's expectations, but investors will be tuning into the company's second-quarter report on July 26 for more hints on potential M&A activity, an analyst said Friday.Gilead's hepatitis C sales slipped in 2016 and, in the months following, the No. 3 biotech said it could be open to a deal, especially in oncology. Analysts have been quick to offer up Incyte (INCY), Tesaro (TSRO), Kite Pharma (KITE) and Clovis Oncology (CLVS) as potential acquisition targets.Others have said Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) would be a smart buy to help fend off a larger dip in its hepatitis C franchise. But Credit Suisse analyst Alethia Young expects Gilead's Harvoni, a key hepatitis C drug, to beat analysts' second-quarter models.For the period, she models Gilead pulling in $6.34 billion in sales, just north of the consensus, and $2.18 adjusted income per share, topping broader forecasts by a nickel. She expects a $110 million beat on U.S. Harvoni sales, at $857 million. That would still be down 7% year over year.Young also expects Gilead's Genvoya, an HIV medication, to top Wall Street views for U.S. sales of $694 million. She models $781 million for the period and sees total prescriptions growing 17% quarter over quarter vs. consensus expectations for just 4% growth.""However, we don't expect shares to react strongly to a beat since we think investors are looking for Gilead to do a deal,"" she wrote in a note clients.IBD'S TAKE: Big biotechs are likely to struggle this year as investor focus turns to smaller, cancer- and rare-disease-focused biotechs, analysts say. Head to the Industry Snapshot for a closer look at which companies are piquing analyst interest.Biogen (BIIB) also will be in the limelight as investors look for a strategic update and plans for growth amid heightened competition in the multiple sclerosis arena. No. 1 drugmaker Roche (RHHBY), in March, gained approval of its drug Ocrevus to treat two forms of multiple sclerosis.Young sees Biogen's key MS drugs, Tecfidera and Tysabri, pulling in-line sales, though her long-term numbers are below the Street. For the quarter, Young forecasts in-line total sales at $2.8 billion, but sees adjusted profits missing views at $4.04 a share to consensus' views for $4.50. Biogen is scheduled to report Q2 results and give a strategic update on July 25.For the strategic update, she looks for Biogen to give some insight into its collaboration with Eisai as well as newly seated Chief Executive Michel Vounatsos' long-term vision for the company. Investors also likely will want an update on Alzheimer's drug aducanumab.""We think investors are hoping to hear that the company will give an interim readout on the aducanumab Phase 3 trial next year,"" she said. ""For some we think it will make them want to own, but for others they may want to wait until after the data.""Incyte could beat on the top line from strong Jakafi sales, but investor focus will likely be on its immuno-oncology drug epacadostat and strategic partnerships with Dow's Merck (MRK) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY). Incyte is set to report Q2 earnings on Aug. 1.More broadly, Young expects an in-line quarter for large-cap biotechs. She sees Amgen (AMGN), Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN), Vertex and BioMarin Pharmaceutical (BMRN) reporting metrics in line with consensus views.RELATED:Gilead Could Acquire This Biotech — But Vertex Is Still Better: AnalystAre Gilead's Fortunes About To Change — Without An Acquisition?Why The Biotech Rally Could Still Tack On Another 15% Upside

296,VRTX,"Celgene (CELG), Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) and Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) could lead the biotech sector to 15% more upside following the second quarter, an analyst said Thursday as shares trekked up for the fifth straight day.XAt the closing bell on the stock market today, IBD's 432-company Biotech industry group was up 1.3%, trading at a 17-month high. Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges credited the lack of drug-pricing headwinds for the five-day uptrend.""The current rally reflects the lifting of perceived fears of pricing regulations, and a favorable tone from the FDA, but does not yet reflect more positive operating results, not to mention industry consolidation, which we still expect,"" he wrote in a note to clients.Porges expects the industry to tack on another 15% upside following what's likely to be a strong second-quarter earnings season. Biotech stocks have added 8% since June 15. On Thursday, leaders included a number of small caps trading below 10.Of the risers, Porges prefers what he calls ""growth stocks"" like Celgene, Regeneron, Vertex and Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN). Since mid-May, Regeneron stock has added 16%, followed by 14% gains for Celgene and Vertex stock.""Gilead Sciences (GILD) performed the worst with only a 5% gain, which is still higher than the overall market,"" he said. Major biotech indexes have added 9%-14% over the last month as the broader market has only tacked on 2% growth.IBD'S TAKE: Analysts began predicting a biotech rally last month. What were the signs and who will benefit the most? Head to the Industry Snapshot for a closer look.Some analysts have said one reason for the sector's surge is that fears are subsiding over the prospect that President Donald Trump might take action to curb pricing. Some analysts now say that Trump's rhetoric to tamp down pricing appears to be ""lip service.""Wall Street expectations for Amgen (AMGN), Gilead and Regeneron's second-quarter earnings have dipped about 1%-2% over the last month and revenue views have been largely flat with a 1% decline for Amgen and Gilead.Large-cap biotechs will have to beat second-quarter views to gain that 15% upside, Porges said. Over the last five years, large caps have beat second-quarter expectations 60%-100% of the time with Amgen, Celgene and Gilead beating both views every time.Guidance increases are 85% more likely in the second quarter than the first, he said. With that, he expects the biotech sector could rally as much as 35%-50% compared to long-term relative multiples vs. the medtech and pharma sectors.RELATED:Could This Small Biotech Pique Interest Of Gilead And Others?Biotechs Surge As Generalists Return Amid Subsiding Trump WoesThese Biotechs Are Leading The Sector To A 3-Month High Today

297,VRTX,"Gilead Sciences' (GILD) fortunes are likely to change this summer on the expected approval of a key hepatitis C drug regimen and after the No. 3 biotech unveils Phase 3 data from an HIV trial, an analyst said Friday.XYear to date, Gilead stock is down 3.3% as of Friday's close. Shares declined as much as 10.5% to the year's low of 64.12 on June 16, but have since recovered somewhat amid a biotech rally that saw the sector rise collectively to a 17-month high in late June. Gilead stock was off marginally to 69.25 on Friday.Needham analyst Alan Carr lists Gilead among the biotechs with ""potential for upside around specific events."" The upside is sorely needed for Gilead which is struggling with a decline in its hepatitis C franchise as the U.S. and European markets mature.Following that decline, Gilead has identified its HIV drug known as bictegravir as its next big hit. In July, Gilead is expected to unveil Phase 3 data for bictegravir during the International AIDS Society conference in Paris, Carr said in a note to clients.In August, the Food and Drug Administration is expected to approve Gilead's combination of sofosbuvir, velpatasvir and voxilaprevir in chronic hepatitis C patients who have failed specific prior treatments. The regimen is a 12-week treatment.Other analysts have suggested that Gilead should make an acquisition to bolster its pipeline. The company has indicated it would like to explore a merger in oncology, fueling rumors that it could be looking at Tesaro (TSRO) or Incyte (INCY).IBD'S TAKE: Among strong biotechs, Exelixis stock has rocketed to highs this year not seen in decades. Head to The New America to see what catalysts sent the stock flying and whether more could be around the corner.Outside of Gilead, Carr sees catalysts for a number of players like Alnylam Pharmaceuticals (ALNY), Intercept Pharmaceuticals (ICPT), Neurocrine Biosciences (NBIX) and Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX).Alnylam is expected to have Phase 3 data for its drug, patisiran, in September. Patisiran is being investigated as a potential treatment for a rare disease that causes abnormal buildup of material called amyloid within the tissues. These deposits can damage the organs.If approved, patisiran will rival drugs from Ionis Pharmaceuticals (IONS). Ionis is currently working on a trial of its drug, inotersen, in a population of these patients. That study should help provide proof of mechanism for both patisiran and inotersen, Carr said.Later in the third quarter, Intercept is likely to announce Phase 2 results of its drug Ocaliva as a treatment for a disease that causes inflammation and scar tissue on the bile ducts. It can ultimately result in liver damage. Ocaliva is already approved to treat a similar liver disease.""We expect (a) positive outcome and await clarity on registration requirements,"" Carr said. ""Our second-quarter Ocaliva sales estimate is $27 million vs. consensus at $26 million.""Neurocrine's second-quarter earnings will, for the first time, include sales from its drug Ingrezza, approved in May as a treatment for involuntary movements associated with long-term use of certain medications. Carr models $800 million in sales for the period.Also in the second quarter, Carr estimates Vertex will bring in $186 million and $294 million in sales of Kalydeco and Orkambi, respectively. Kalydeco and Orkambi are cystic fibrosis drugs for patients with specific genetic mutations.RELATED:Gilead And Vertex Should Join — But Don't Hold Your Breath: AnalystWhy The Biotech Rally Could Still Tack On Another 15% UpsideCould This Small Biotech Pique Interest Of Gilead And Others?

But don't expect anything earth shattering, they say.""The next quarter and a half is likely to feature significant disclosures for a number of companies in our coverage, but is unlikely to be a period of strongly stock-moving events,"" Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges wrote in a recent note to clients.Porges' view follows a third quarter in which large caps struggled as their historic moneymakers caught the double whammy of increasing competition and pricing concerns. Meanwhile, smaller caps crushed expectations.As a result, IBD's 462-company Biotech industry group, ranked first just a month ago, is now listed as No. 37 out of the 197 groups IBD tracks. Shares touched a 22-month high in October, but have since lost nearly 6%.""However, the flow of events is set to accelerate in early 2018, and the first quarter offers more opportunities for meaningful value inflection across biopharmaceutical companies and stocks,"" Leerink analysts wrote in a recent note.Despite frustration depressing biotech stocks, the group has posted an impressive number of new approvals this year, JMP Securities analyst Mike King said. According to the Food and Drug Administration, 140 original applications for drugs and biologics have been approved this year.""You need product approvals,"" he told Investor's Business Daily. ""Even the most jaded observer of the sector would have to say the sector as a whole has produced very satisfactory results when it comes to major trial readouts. I don't see any change in that regard.""Tacking on drug approvals and successful data readouts will be key for companies like Celgene (CELG) and Gilead Sciences (GILD), a pair of large biotech leaders facing a growing field of competitors for their moneymakers Revlimid and hepatitis C drugs, respectively.Celgene is set to have two readouts in a type of Non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and could have CAR-T developments from partners Bluebird Bio (BLUE) and Juno Therapeutics (JUNO). CAR-T drugs treat cancer using a patient's own re-engineered immune cells.Both are important for Celgene, which has long enjoyed revenue gains from chemotherapy Revlimid. Analysts had been expecting generic competition from Dr. Reddy's Laboratories (RDY) in 2020. Recently, though, Dr. Reddy's missed a key deadline to file its generic.Still, it's less than ideal for Celgene to rely so heavily on one stream of revenue, FBB Partners analyst Mike Bailey said. Celgene had been preparing to replace some of its patent-challenged Revlimid sales with a Crohn's disease drug. But the firm said in October it won't initiate Phase 3 trials of that drug.""The bull case on Celgene previously was that they had these new drugs to limit the risk for Revlimid,"" he told IBD. ""If you take away the risk management piece, all of the focus is on this one drug which is going to go generic at some point.""Similarly, Gilead has an HIV combination using its drug bictegravir set to gain potential approval in February. This could accelerate HIV sales starting in the second quarter, Porges said. At the same time, ARK Invest analyst Manisha Samy says Gilead will likely get further into CAR-T in 2018. Gilead also announced Thursday its $567 million acquisition of Cell Design Labs, a privately held CAR-T player.In October, Gilead acquired Kite Pharma for nearly $12 billion. This followed the FDA's approval of Kite's drug, dubbed Yescarta, to treat large B-cell lymphoma in adults. Due to their individualized nature, CAR-T drugs aren't likely to rake in the same sales as Gilead's now faltering hepatitis C drugs.""But two or three years down the line, that could be a huge revenue maker,"" she told IBD.IBD'S TAKE: Big-caps struggled in the third quarter which isn't surprising considering a patent cliff over the next 10 years is set to hit some $17 billion in annual sales for blockbuster drugs, says one analyst. Head to the Industry Snapshot for more on how biotechs fared in the period.Yescarta won't replace Gilead's hepatitis C franchise at its peak, but it will grow steadily, Bailey said.""My guess is hepatitis C is going to shrink really quickly,"" he said. ""At some point I would expect CAR-T to replace hepatitis C sales, but no way at the peak. That was once-ever in terms of what Gilead did. It will never be that big.""In the next several months, Leerink's Porges looks for AbbVie (ABBV) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) to disclose pivotal trial or regulatory events, while Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) will report more ""value-confirming events.""AbbVie will have data for an anti-inflammatory treatment known as upadacitinib, he said. Those results could add more detail to the evolving landscape of what are known as JAK inhibitors that treat psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis and ulcerative colitis, among a number of conditions.Regeneron is on deck to file the results of its drug Dupixent in asthma. The drug is already approved to treat eczema. The firm could also report data for its eye drug, Eylea, and for its immuno-oncology drug, cemiplimab, in a type of skin cancer.Also, look for Vertex to provide Phase 2 data for two of its triple-pill combinations to treat cystic fibrosis. In total, Vertex is testing four potential regimens to bring into Phase 3 trials. The firm is also likely to gain approval for a two-drug combination in February.In the Big Pharma world, Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez says there are few significant stock-moving catalysts left in 2017, but the first half of 2018 will be busy.Dow's Merck (MRK), Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) and AstraZeneca (AZN) all have immuno-oncology combo results in lung cancer, while Bristol and Merck/Incyte (INCY) are set to deliver results from their regimens in melanoma.Bristol could also offer interim data from a trial of its immuno-oncology drugs Opdivo and Yervoy as a first treatment for lung cancer.Outside those, ""major immuno-oncology catalysts should (thankfully!) be limited,"" he said. There's a high bar on Bristol's interim data, which require nothing short of stopping the study early on extreme effectiveness. That's unlikely, so expectations are probably low, he said.""Nonetheless, an early stop would be a major validation of Bristol's strategy — likely driving the stock up 15% in our view,"" he said. ""Continuation of the study would likely increase concerns over Bristol's strategy and the ultimate success of the study at the final analysis, possibly pushing the stock down 5%-10%.""PARP inhibitors, yet another class of cancer drugs, are set to have trial results as well. AstraZeneca will have results for its drug, Lynparza, as a first maintenance treatment in ovarian cancer.""I think the PARP space will be quite large,"" JMP's King said. ""It's hard to tell in the real world if doctors will see these drugs as better so they can start producing some satisfactory sales figures.""RELATED:Biotechs Sell Off In Droves — Are Investors Seeking Mergers?This Biotech Just Neared A 17-Year High On Strong Cancer RegimenThis Cancer Biotech Is Falling On Its $1.55 Billion Bayer Deal

306,VRTX,"SAN FRANCISCO — Big biotechs Celgene and Vertex Pharmaceuticals disappointed investors with their 2016 guidance, while gene-sequencing giant Illumina previewed a variety of futuristic products, at a major investor conference Monday.
"
307,VRTX,"The news at the annual JPMorgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco, sent Celgene (CELG) and Vertex (VRTX) stocks falling Monday, while Illumina (ILMN) shares rose a fraction.
"
308,VRTX,"Celgene said Q4 EPS totaled $1.18 a share, up 17% from the year-earlier quarter but missing by 9 cents the consensus of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. Product sales (which cover not quite all of revenue) were $2.54 billion, in line with Wall Street's revenue estimate.
"
309,VRTX,"Celgene is scheduled to report final Q4 earnings on Jan. 28.
"
310,VRTX,"For 2016, Celgene guided EPS of $5.50 to $5.70, up 19% from the expected final 2015 number but on the low side of analysts' $5.68 projection. Product sales were guided at $10.5 billion to $11 billion, while analysts forecast revenue of $11.1 billion.
"
311,VRTX,"Nonetheless, Celgene added 5 cents to its 2020 EPS guidance, which it had already raised last summer, to $13 from $12.50.
"
312,VRTX,"Celgene also said that in March, Bob Hugin, who's led the company for 17 years, will become executive chairman and hand the CEO job over to Mark Alles, currently the president and COO. Alles, in turn, will hand his position to Jacqualyn Fouse, now the president of Celgene's hematology and oncology franchise, which makes up the majority of its business.
"
313,VRTX,"Scott Smith, who heads the inflammation and immunology business, will add the role of chair of the Global Management Committee.
"
314,VRTX,"Regarding Q4, Celgene said it included a 7-cent charge due to a $70 million milestone payment to OncoMed (OMED) stemming from positive data of demcizumab, a cancer drug that Celgene has licensed. Evercore ISI analyst Mark Schoenebaum wrote in a research note that it was ""unclear"" whether the consensus forecast had factored that in, but he wrote that both the other numbers were basically in-line.
"
315,VRTX,"Speaking at the conference, Hugin said that in Q4, Celgene had to absorb a 17-cent hit from closing its $7.2 billion acquisition of Receptos, which brought potential blockbuster immunology drug ozanimod. He was highly optimistic about Celgene's budding immunology franchise in general; psoriasis drug Otezla launched in 2014 and brought $472 million in 2015, which Hugin called ""the most successful launch of any therapeutic in the history of this therapeutic area in terms of its progress in this first full year of launch.""
"
316,VRTX,"Analysts were divided about the management changes. Schoenebaum wrote that the changes had generally been expected, but RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee wrote that the CEO transition seemed early.

The aim of the company is to develop a new genetic test for early-stage cancers that can be derived from a simple blood sample.
"
321,VRTX,"On Monday, it announced the MiniSeq System, the simplest, cheapest gene sequencer that it has yet produced. The MiniSeq, expected launch this quarter, is priced at $49,500, with each sample costing about $200 to $300 to process, CEO Jay Flatley said at the conference.
"
322,VRTX,"Also Monday, Illumina unveiled a new partnership with Bio-Rad (BIO) to develop a next-generation sequencing solution to analyze a single cell. Single-cell analyses are useful in understanding cell variations in cancer and other diseases, Flatley said, but normally they are analyzed only from a small batch. Illumina and Bio-Rad aim for a high-throughput solution combining their technologies, which they expect to launch late this year or early next year.
"
323,VRTX,"Flatley also previewed a handheld sequencing device Illumina is working on called Firefly, based on CMOS technology the company acquired a couple years ago. That will be a ways down the road, however.
"
324,VRTX,"Flatley also said he expects revenue to grow 16% this year, in line with consensus, while EPS guidance of $3.55 to $3.65 a share was below the Street's $3.72 estimate.

346,VRTX,"Morgan Stanley analyst Matthew Harrison downgraded Gilead Sciences (GILD) while upgrading Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) and Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX), based on where he sees near-term catalysts in the current volatile market.Harrison maintained his price target of 127 on Gilead, but lowered his rating to equal-weight from overweight based on ""relative attractiveness"" to the other two stocks. Harrison wrote in a research note that while it's true that Gilead has the cash to make a substantial acquisition, he doesn't think there's a really big one in the immediate future.""Management offered a few comments around M&A at our recent conference which suggests to us that management is focused on multiple deals for clinical stage assets awaiting derisking data, similar to the Bristol-Myers (BMY) string of pearls strategy,"" Harrison wrote. ""While we believe this is the smart strategy for Gilead and should generate above average long-term returns, we also do not see this strategy offering a single deal that could re-rate Gilead as some investors have suggested.""At the same time, Harrison wrote that the long-term outlook on the hepatitis C market will be unclear until next year, when the EU rollout is more advanced and after Merck (MRK) has unveiled more data on its own pipeline.Gilead stock was down 1.5% near 97 in midday trading on the stock market today.Picking The Big-Cap WinnersMeanwhile, Harrison liked the position of Vertex as it moves into what's expected to be its first profitable quarter in two years, thanks to the recent launch of cystic-fibrosis drug Orkambi.""We see a strong Orkambi launch based on physician feedback, suggesting 2015 revenue as much as $100 million above consensus,"" Harrison wrote. ""Biotechs transitioning to profitability have historically outperformed peers by 15 times in the 12 months following transition.""Harrison upgraded Vertex stock to overweight from equal-weight and set a price target of 148.Vertex stock was up 5%, near 113, midday Friday, after touching a nearly one-year low of 97.45 on Tuesday.Harrison also upgraded Alexion stock to overweight from equal-weight, with a price target of 211, writing that the recent sell-off in drug stocks has created an attractive entry point for the orphan-drug stock.""While Alexion has only declined 7% vs. 10% for its other large-cap biotech peers, Alexion has been an underperformer year-to-date, down 15%, the most of all large cap biotechs,"" Harrison noted. ""Thus, given the robust set of new product launches, potential pipeline upside and consensus now more aware of the competitive landscape for Soliris, we see the potential for Alexion to outperform out of the weakness generated by concerns around government pricing.""Alexion stock was up 4% in midday trading Friday, near 164. That still leaves shares down more than 20% from an all-time high near 209 touched in July, before the stock market's tumble proved especially tough on biotechs.Follow Amy Reeves on Twitter @IBD_Areeves and on Facebook.

347,VRTX,"The European Union's medical advisory committee endorsed several key drugs from leading stocks Friday, making EU approval likely for some potential blockbusters: The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, known by its French abbreviation, CHMP, adopted a positive opinion on Gilead Sciences ' (GILD) Genvoya to manage HIV infection. Genvoya is a four-drug combo pill identical to Gilead's popular treatment Stribild, except that in place of one ingredient, Viread, Gilead has put its new drug tenofovir alafenamide (TAF).TAF is known around Wall Street as ""son of Viread"" because it's a similar compound, but altered so that a lower dose can be used which in turn reduces side effects. Crucially for Gilead, it also won't hit Viread's patent expiries, which are due to start in 2018. As Stribild's sales passed $1 billion last year and are expected to top $2 billion next year, this is a key revenue driver even for a company as big as Gilead. The CHMP also endorsed two blood-cancer drugs from Amgen (AMGN). Kyprolis, which Amgen got when it acquired Onyx Pharmaceuticals in 2013, was first approved for multiple myeloma in the U.S. in 2012 but hasn't yet hit the market in the European Union. While it was first approved as a lone treatment, Amgen has been pushing a combo of Kyprolis with Celgene's (CELG) Revlimid and dexamethasone, based on a successful new trial in patients who've received at least one prior therapy. The FDA approved this combo in July.Kyprolis isn't a big revenue driver for the big biotech now, but analysts expect annual sales to hit $1.7 billion by 2020.The CHMP also backed a newer drug, Blincyto, for certain types of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Blincyto is a bispecific T cell engager (BiTE) antibody, which combine bits of two different antibodies to engage the body's T cells to attack cancer cells.Analyst expectations aren't huge for Blinctyo, but Amgen recently cut a licensing deal to use Xencor's (XNCR) longer-lasting BiTE technology to develop newer, better drugs. Vertex Pharmaceuticals' (VRTX) Orkambi for cystic fibrosis also got the CHMP thumbs-up Friday. Orkambi gained a fair bit of media attention when it won its U.S. approval in July, as cystic fibrosis is a devastating disease with few treatments, which gives Vertex considerable pricing power. The consensus calls for annual sales to pass $5 billion by 2020.""Our models already reflect an Orkambi launch in Europe in early 2016 for CF patients 12 and older (n=12,000),"" wrote Maxim Group analyst Jason Kolbert in a research note. ""However, we anticipate a slower launch trajectory than in the U.S. (n=8,500) due to the need to obtain reimbursement on a country-by-country basis."" Speaking of orphan diseases, Horizon Pharma's (HZNP) Ravicti also got a CHMP endorsement as a treatment for ultra-rare urea cycle disorders (UCDs). Ravicti was one of the drugs that Horizon acquired with its $1.1 billion of Hyperion Therapeutics this year, and one that Piper Jaffray analyst David Amsellem highlighted as a potential growth driver on March 31 when the deal was announced.""Ravicti was approved by the FDA in February 2013, and now has sales annualizing to around $105 million,"" Amsellem wrote. ""According to Hyperion, the U.S. prevalence of UCD is around 2,100. Hyperion has estimated that only around 1,100 UCD patients are actually diagnosed, and only around 675 are on treatment.""Ravicti costs $330,000 a year in the U.S., but Amsellem pointed out that's not that steep for an orphan drug and Horizon could price it higher. He did not estimate European pricing, however.Despite these endorsements, all the stocks were down on the stock market today as drug stocks continued their recent bumpy ride. In afternoon trading Friday, Gilead and Amgen shares were down 2%, and Vertex and Horizon stocks were both down 6%.Follow Amy Reeves on Twitter @IBD_Areeves and on Facebook.

"
351,VRTX,"The agency gave the nod to Orkambi, a combination of ivacaftor (which Vertex markets separately as Kalydeco) and lumacaftor, a booster that makes the drug effective in treating a much larger population than ivacaftor alone.
"
352,VRTX,"The FDA approved the product for patients whose condition is caused by two copies of the F508del mutation (homozygous), who account for about half of the 30,000 CF patients in the U.S.
"
353,VRTX,"However, the improvement that Orkambi yielded in clinical trials was smaller than Kalydeco's, which led to a widespread expectation that Vertex would price Orkambi lower than Kalydeco's $312,000-a-year mark. A buyside investor survey conducted by Evercore ISI on Monday found that the mean expected price was $235,000 while the median was $250,000, so the eventual $259,000 price was a bit on the high side.
"
354,VRTX,"Company Chief Financial Officer Ian Smith, however, hints that the discount rate for Orkambi might be higher than for Kalydeco. After discounts, Kalydeco costs an average of $220,000 a year.
"

357,VRTX,"Arbuckle says that the lift-off for Orkambi will likely be slower than it was with Kalydeco.

362,VRTX,"The drama continued for big biotech Gilead Sciences Tuesday, as Johnson & Johnson moved into its viral-disease turf on two fronts with an acquisition.
"
363,VRTX,"Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) disclosed that it's buying privately held Alios BioPharma for $1.75 billion in cash. In a press release, J&J touted Alios' drug candidate for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), a major cause of lung infection that has no current treatment. The drug, AL-8176, is in midstage clinical testing.
"
364,VRTX,"As it happens, Gilead (GILD) also has an RSV drug, GS-5806, in phase two clinical trials. Though it's been overshadowed by Gilead's bigger drugs, RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee believes it has blockbuster potential. AstraZeneca's (AZN) Synagis, used to prevent RSV infection in high-risk infants, draws more than $1 billion a year just from that niche market.
"
365,VRTX,"Yee pointed out in a research note Tuesday that Alios is a potential competitor to Gilead in another way: It has two nucleotide drugs for the hepatitis C virus (HCV) in early stages of development.
"
366,VRTX,"Gilead's megablockbuster Sovaldi was the first nucleotide drug for HCV to hit the market, back in December. And this year, Merck (MRK) shelled out $3.85 billion to buy Idenix Pharmaceuticals because it also has ""nukes"" in development.
"
367,VRTX,"Not New To Hep C
"
368,VRTX,"J&J is also in the HCV game with its drug Olysio, which is a different class of drug and not directly competitive to Sovaldi.
"
369,VRTX,"The two are often prescribed together, which has helped buoy Olysio's sales; after its launch last November, in the first half of this year alone it sold $1.2 billion. Given the success of that combo, it's not surprising that J&J might want nukes of its own.
"
370,VRTX,"""We clearly think the long-term 'call option' upside here is the Alios nukes ... if those can show a four-log (99.99%) reduction in HCV virus and have a good safety profile,"" Yee wrote. ""Of course, that is not a layup, as we know development of nukes can be extremely difficult and the bar for continued progression is very high. As a reminder, Vertex (VRTX) was partnered on two prior Alios nukes and dropped development of both due to a narrow therapeutic window (one weak efficacy, one had signs of liver toxicity).""
"
371,VRTX,"Yee also wrote that it will be interesting to see how this development reads across to Achillion Pharmaceuticals (ACHN). Its stock boasts an IBD Relative Strength Rating of 99 based largely on the expectation that it would be the next nuke developer to be bought. Investors seemed to be reading it negatively: Achillion's stock fell 7.3% Tuesday to close at 9.98.

372,VRTX,"Still, Maxim Group analyst and Achillion bull Jason Kolbert did not sound very worried.
"
373,VRTX,"""Alios nukes are old news,"" Kolbert told IBD. ""I think ACHN being down is a bit of nonsense. If their nuke shows good data, we are off to the races!""
"
374,VRTX,"The High Price Of Sovaldi
"
375,VRTX,"Investors and analysts are interested in future competition to Sovaldi, not just for its effect on market share but also on Sovaldi's price, which some have questioned since day one.
"
376,VRTX,"Gilead charges $1,000 a day for the treatment, which typically runs for 12 weeks.
"
377,VRTX,"On Monday, the government of France addressed the issue in its 2015 social security budget bill. It proposed new taxes on sellers of hepatitis C drugs for whatever revenue they make if France's social security has to spend more than 450 million euros on the drugs. The government called this a ""progressive contribution scheme.""
"
378,VRTX,"The budget still has to be approved by lawmakers, but it's a sign that European countries are continuing to drive a hard bargain as Gilead rolls out Sovaldi there. The EU approved Sovaldi for sale in January, but every country has its own payment system that drugmakers have to negotiate separately.

""I think ACHN being down is a bit of nonsense. If their nuke shows good data, we are off to the races!""The High Price Of SovaldiInvestors and analysts are interested in future competition to Sovaldi, not just for its effect on market share but also on Sovaldi's price, which some have questioned since day one.Gilead charges $1,000 a day for the treatment, which typically runs for 12 weeks.On Monday, the government of France addressed the issue in its 2015 social security budget bill. It proposed new taxes on sellers of hepatitis C drugs for whatever revenue they make if France's social security has to spend more than 450 million euros on the drugs. The government called this a ""progressive contribution scheme.""The budget still has to be approved by lawmakers, but it's a sign that European countries are continuing to drive a hard bargain as Gilead rolls out Sovaldi there. The EU approved Sovaldi for sale in January, but every country has its own payment system that drugmakers have to negotiate separately.However, in July France joined with 13 other countries to coordinate their strategies to drive down Sovaldi's price.Gilead's stock slipped 1% Tuesday to close at 106.45.

388,VRTX,"Vertex Pharmaceuticals' (VRTX) cystic fibrosis drug sales popped 22% in the first quarter, helping drive a $200 million-plus sales beat and profit that topped Wall Street's expectations by a penny.In after-hours trading, Vertex stock lifted 1.7%, near 119.40, after closing up less than 1%, at 117.23. Shares are up 59% for the year, outperforming IBD's 425-company Medical-Biomed/Biotech industry group, which is up just 12.3% since January.For the first quarter ended March 31, Vertex reported $714.7 million in sales, up 80% vs. the year-earlier period. That was helped by a $230 million collaborative payment from Merck KGaA in the quarter. Of that, $36.4 million was paid in taxes to German authorities, but Vertex filed for, and expects, a refund.Sales easily beat analysts' expectations for $510.55 million, but without the $230 million in collaborative payments from Merck KGaA they would have lagged the model by about $26 million. Adjusted earnings of 41 cents per share grew 356% and beat by a penny.Vertex's bread-and-butter segment, cystic fibrosis, saw sales grow 22% to $480.6 million in the first quarter. Orkambi and Kalydeco, CF drugs, brought in $294.9 million and $185.7 million in sales, respectively, growing 32.2% and 8.9%.IBD'S TAKE: Vertex has an IBD Composite Rating of 98 out of a best-possible 99, meaning it outperforms all but 2% of stocks in terms of key growth metrics. Head to IBD Stock Checkup for a list of the top-rated biotechs.Vertex saw continued uptake in Orkambi among children age 6-11 in the U.S. and completed an application for the same group of patients with regulators in Europe, CEO Jeffrey Leiden said in a statement.During the quarter, Vertex also unveiled strong data from two Phase 3 studies combining tezacaftor and ivacaftor to treat cystic fibrosis. The combination showed a statistically significant improvement in lung function for patients with the disorder.The company is also looking at four potential drugs that could be combined with tezacaftor and ivacaftor to create a triple-pill for cystic fibrosis patients. Vertex expects three to have data in the second half of 2017 and one to have data in early 2018.""We remain focused on advancing key CF programs, including our triple combination regimens, to support our goal of providing treatments for all people with CF,"" Leiden said.RELATED:AbbVie Hovers Near Buy Point After Q1 Earnings, Sales TopCelgene Dips On $95 Million Lag In Psoriasis Sales, But Earnings TopBristol-Myers Stock Pops On Street-Crushing Q1 Revenue, Profits

389,VRTX,"Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) stock rocketed to a 14-month high Wednesday after the biotech announced its two-drug pill for cystic fibrosis improved lung function in a pair of late-stage studies.By the closing bell on the stock market today, Vertex stock had jumped 20.5% to 108.01 after earlier rising as much as 24.8%. Shares last hit that level in January 2016. IBD's 422-company Biomed/Biotech industry group spiked 2.2%.Vertex said a combination of tezacaftor and ivacaftor — the latter of which sells under the brand name Kalydeco — significantly improved lung function in cystic fibrosis patients ages 12 and up with specific genetic mutations.During the 24-week Evolve study, the combo pill — or doublet — showed a 4 percentage point improvement from baseline in patients' ability to forcefully expel breath for one second vs. the placebo.In an eight-week study of patients, the doublet showed a 6.8 percentage point improvement on average at weeks four and eight compared with the placebo and ivacaftor alone. Ivacaftor monotherapy showed a 4.7 percentage point improvement.Vertex plans to file applications with the FDA and regulators in Europe in the third quarter.Across both studies, the doublet was well tolerated. Most common side effects included cough and ineffective pulmonary exacerbation. Only 1.7% of patients on the doublet discontinued use due to an adverse event.That differs from Orkambi, which associated with bronchorestriction, tightening of muscles near the lungs resulting in coughing, wheezing and shortness of breath. Vertex's Orkambi is a doublet comprised of lumacaftor and ivacaftor.Wall Street had broadly expected tezacaftor and ivacaftor to show a 3%-5% improvement in lung function, Janney analyst Debjit Chattopadhyay said. He called the low respiratory event rate ""compellingly positive."" Only 13.1% of patients had an adverse respiratory event.IBD'S TAKE: In medical-aesthetics, one drugmaker is leading the way. Can anyone challenge this player? Head to the Industry Snapshot for more.""The safety profile should mitigate some of the commercial concerns surrounding Orkambi, which suggests potential upside to fiscal 2018-19 estimates,"" he wrote in a note to clients. He has a neutral rating on Vertex stock, saying ""challenges loom"" with its triplet.But JMP analyst Liisa Bayko says the tezacaftor and ivacaftor combination provides a ""stronger backbone for a triple combo."" She reiterated her market perform rating and raised her price target on Vertex stock to 121 from 115.The triplet will combine tezacaftor, ivacaftor and a drug known as VX-440. Credit Suisse analyst Alethia Young boosted her expectations for ivacaftor to 100% from 75%. She models $1 billion in peak sales of ivacaftor in 2023.Young has an outperform rating on Vertex stock. She boosted her price target to 108 from 100.UBS analyst Carter Gould also raised his expectations on ivacaftor to 100% from 80%. Vertex's tezacaftor and ivacaftor doublet compares favorably with Orkambi on all points, he wrote in a research report. He raised his price target on Vertex stock to 112 from 106, with a buy rating.RELATED:Biotech Stocks Might Catalyze, Or Plunge, On 4 Key Sectors In 2017Vertex Sales Guidance For Cystic Fibrosis Drug Orkambi MissesAmgen, Biogen, Celgene Eye M&A In Trump's 'Pro-Biotech' World

390,VRTX,"Just as an ace baseball pitcher mixes his throws, top mutual fund managers vary their investments. Managers of Columbia Large Cap Growth Fund are mingling semiconductor stocks with biotech stocks, online travel agencies and a Chinese fast-food chain, all to good effect. That's been a benefit to investors with retirement accounts and other portfolios.The $3.3 billion fund is working its way back toward its multiyear top-notch outperformance. This year going into Wednesday, the fund's 8.97% gain topped 62% of its large-cap growth rivals tracked by Morningstar Inc. and the 5.75% advance by the S&P 500.That's an improvement over its showing during the past 12 months, when the fund outpaced just 54% of its direct rivals with a nonetheless decent 15.49% rise. So its year-to-date relative performance is a turn back toward what it accomplished over the past three years, when it beat 89% of its direct rivals.A key piece of credit goes to the fund's stake in technology stocks, which was the portfolio's largest sector as of Feb. 28 with a 34% weighting, nearly double the second-largest sector then, consumer discretionary. The S&P 500 has a tech weighting of 20%.The fund's semiconductor stocks include Lam Research (LRCX), up 19% so far this year; Micron Technology (MU), up 22% this year; and Broadcom (AVGO), up 18%.IBD'S TAKE: Broadcom is ranked No. 1 in IBD's Electronics-Semiconductor Fabless industry group. Its 99 Composite Rating is the highest possible, and its earnings per share growth has accelerated for four quarters in a row. See how its additional easy-to-understand fundamental and technical data stack up against rivals' at IBD's Stock Checkup.Biotech bets include Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX), up 56%, and Celgene (CELG), up 8%. Two of the fund's consumer discretionary plays are online travel agencies Priceline (PCLN) and Expedia (EXPE), which are up 19% and 14% respectively this year.And China-based restaurant chain Yum China (YUMC) is another security to like in the consumer discretionary space, up 25% this year.They've also trying to make plays with multicategory straddlers Alibaba (BABA) and Amazon (AMZN).Lam has benefited from two trends. One is the growing complexity in some semiconductors and their manufacturing equipment, says Peter Deininger, one of three managers of the fund. The second is consolidation in the semiconductor equipment space. That has cut inventory volatility, and smoothed out industry cycles. ""That means higher margins and higher returns for Lam,"" Deininger said.In addition, Lam is a leader in the etching and deposition segment of the semiconductor equipment field. ""That's helped them increase market share at a rate in excess of other players,"" Deininger said. ""Combined, all of this has put the company in a good situation, which we anticipate has legs to go.""Micron makes memory and data-storage devices. Its industry has gone through enough consolidation that pricing is stable to rising in Micron's key DRAM and NAND products, Deininger says. That leads to rising margins, he adds.Industrywide, with earnings and share prices doing so well last year, might the segment be near a top? That could explain the recent pullback in this space, which affected Micron among other stocks.But Deininger is not ready to retreat yet. ""There continues to be very balanced supply, pricing remains firm, and lead times for products are modestly extended,"" he said. ""Combined with a lack of significant new capacity, that argues that (share-price strength) should hold for some time going forward.""Fund manager Tchintcia Barros likes Vertex's existing treatments for cystic fibrosis as well as another in development. Vertex gapped up 20% on March 29 amid news about favorable results in a late-stage trial for that new treatment, a combination therapy. Vertex plans to add another drug to create a three-drug cocktail that could treat thousands more cystic fibrosis patients, Barros says.""Several months ago, a competitor (Galapagos) created some fears (among investors) around whether Vertex would have that portfolio of treatments to itself,"" Barros said. ""But data show that (Galapagos) is three years behind Vertex.""The fund's managers have mixed feelings about the consumer discretionary space. On the one hand, since the end of last year they have shifted to an underweight from an overweight in the sector vs. the Russell 1000 Growth Index.They've sold out of positions in branded apparel manufacturer VF (VFC), yogawear chain store Lululemon Athletica (LULU) and pharmacy operator CVS Health (CVS). ""Online companies have put a lot of pressure on traditional retail areas,"" manager John Wilson said.On the other hand, the fund still likes online travel agencies Priceline and Expedia.And the managers like Yum China as a pure play on China restaurant stocks.Yum China gapped up 9% on April 6, the day it released first-quarter financial results. Earnings per share grew 19%. Despite a 1% slip in sales, sales nosed above the consensus estimate. The company opened 133 new stores in the quarter, including its Little Sheep and East Dawning outlets.In its guidance for fiscal 2017, the company said it would open at least 550 new stores and that operating profit would grow at a double-digit pace.Yum Brands (YUM) — which the fund also holds — said it had completed its spinoff of Yum China on Nov. 1, 2016. Since they began trading that day, shares in the new company are up 25%.RELATED: Why This Top Columbia Fund Loads Up On These Stock LeadersYou Need This Much Retirement Savings At Your Age And Income

391,VRTX,"How do you get a handle on the biotech market when an unknown stock like Esperion Therapeutics (ESPR) — up nearly 200% since January — outperforms the likes of the industry's top name, Amgen (AMGN)?Sure, Esperion has had some breakthroughs in cholesterol medication. But Amgen recently had its own moment with one of its cholesterol drugs, proving that decreasing ""bad"" LDL cholesterol also cuts the risk of heart attack and stroke. Still, Amgen isn't getting the respect that smaller biotech players are getting, up a comparatively paltry 11% this year.Don't get discouraged, though, analysts say. Just because Amgen isn't getting a lot of love, it doesn't mean other biotech stocks are slouches. It's really a question of navigating what can be a complex sector.Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges says biotechs have done well since the election, though the stocks are subject to the whims of political debate over drug pricing and health care.""We're worried about Donald Trump and health care reform ... we're worried about FDA reform and now we're worried about drug-pricing regulations,"" he said. ""And it just doesn't seem as though the accumulated worries are going to go away in a hurry.""The overall group, though, looks strong. It's now ranked No. 10 out of 197 groups tracked, and four weeks ago it was ranked No. 5.IBD'S TAKE: Among drugmakers, Allergan is sweeping the medical-aesthetics market. But Hologic wants to play. Head to the Industry Snapshot for a breakdown on that battle.Porges and Mizuho analyst Salim Syed call it a ""stock-pickers market."" Some biotechs are bound to do well in 2017 with a number of catalysts still ahead of them, while others are more likely to struggle with macroeconomics and politics.""There are still some pressures that investors need to be cognitive of, like drug pricing,"" Syed told IBD. ""Some folks thought that was a presidential platform topic, but it keeps coming up now in the postelection.""IBD's 425-company Biomed/Biotech industry group is up 12% for the year. Major exchange traded funds iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology Index (IBB) and the SPDR S&P Biotech (XBI) are up 12% and 20%, respectively.The top five biotechs include Amgen, Gilead Sciences (GILD), Celgene (CELG), Biogen (BIIB) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN). Each has been in the news in 2017, but none on stock price. Amgen has gained the most at 11% with Gilead lagging, down 6% since January.Syed has buy ratings on Amgen, Celgene and Gilead stocks and a neutral rating on Biogen stock.But the smaller players and potential takeout candidates like Incyte (INCY) and Tesaro (TSRO) have seen big gains on Wall Street. Tesaro is likely to remain a stand-alone company, though, after grabbing FDA approval for ovarian cancer drug, Zejula. Its stock rose as much as 43% through mid-February but is now up only 3% for the year.Incyte, on the other hand, has tacked on 24% since January on rumors that No. 2 biotech Gilead could be looking to acquire it. Incyte would open Gilead up to the oncology world as its hepatitis C franchise struggles amid high cure rates.""Once again, we're starting the year with the best-performing stocks being those that were cheapest and more of takeout candidates,"" Porges told IBD. ""So (making predictions has) definitely been somewhat challenging.""Earlier this month, Nektar Therapeutics (NKTR) stock hit an 11-year high on strong data for a pain pill that could be an alternative to potentially addictive Oxycodone. Nektar stock catapulted 43% in a single day. Shares extended 25% from a cup-with-handle formation in late March, but have since given back 20% of those gains. The stock remains up 58% for the year.Other big stock earners include Kite Pharma (KITE) and Bluebird Bio (BLUE), both of which are working on drugs that belong to a class called CAR T-cell therapies. These drugs engineer patients' immune cells to treat cancer. Kite stock is up a whopping 80%, leading a 42% rise in Bluebird stock.And as Esperion rocketed on Amgen's heart study, so too did The Medicines Company (MDCO). Shares are up 45% since January. Porges lists Medicines Co. as a stock to watch, noting its ""spectacular returns.""""If you have the right stock and the right set of events, then you can still generate incredibly attractive returns and that's the excitement of biotech,"" Porges said. ""These are companies that are approaching critical readouts of ongoing development programs where investors think there's a reasonable chance a critical trial or a critical milestone turns out positively.""Mizuho's Syed suggests looking at individual stocks and equities, rather than hoping for a broad biotech resurgence. He sees a ""good number of catalysts"" in 2017 for the market, but notes the drug-pricing debate is likely to still weigh on the market.President Trump has keyed in on the drug-pricing debate and, though limited on details, says he has plans for a competitive-based system that would bring down the prices of drugs. Trump's pick to run the FDA, Scott Gottlieb, has said drug-pricing needs to be more transparent.As that struggle unfolds, Porges laid out some rules for picking biotech stocks likely to have better returns.""You want to be in growth companies early in their life cycle treating very serious illnesses,"" he said. ""And if you follow those three rules, you are generally going to end up with a portfolio that's going to perform better than the average, better than the index, better than the benchmarks.""Under those rules, Porges says Epizyme (EPZM), Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) and Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) are interesting. Epizyme stock is up 44% since January, having topped a 12.70 buy point out of a cup-with-handle formation in early February. Vertex stock has gained 23% this year.Alexion stock is actually down 3% year to date, but the stock fits the bill using Porges' rules. The rare-disease company is working on drugs to treat disorders of the central nervous system, blood diseases and genetic disorders.The worst thing to do in biotech investing is to sell just because a stock is up, Porges said. And don't hesitate to buy a stock for the same reason.""One of the axioms of investing in biotech is always you never want to say, 'I'm not going to buy the stock because it's up,' because this is an industry where you can routinely see five-to-tenfold increases in value over the cycle of the emergence of a product,"" he said.""So often we see a stock where investors say, 'It's up 50%, but it's only gone from a $500 million market cap to a $750 million market cap,' which in the scheme of things is pretty small,"" he said. ""If you have a real drug, you're going to be a $5 billion or $6 billion company.""RELATED:Esperion And Medicines Co.

392,VRTX,"The major indexes mainly treaded water late in Tuesday's relatively quiet session. The Dow Jones industrial average, however, is showing bullish action by maintaining strength at its 50-day moving average.The Dow Jones industrials, enjoying strong gains by the likes of industrial giants Caterpillar (CAT) and United Technologies (UTX), edged up around 0.1% during a day of narrow-range trading. That's in contrast with Monday, in which the 30-stock blue-chip index fell to an intraday low of 20,517, but bounced higher after a challenge of support at the key 50-day moving average.The Dow showed an earlier test of strength at this intermediate-term support line on March 27.Cat tried, but failed on Tuesday to climb back above its 50-day moving average. Leading stocks tend to travel above their 50-day lines in preparation for a potential breakout. The good news for Cat shareholders is that the stock is trading less than 6% below its 52-week high of 99.46.United Tech, meanwhile, has made limited upside progress since the stock rallied past a 109.52 cup-with-handle entry point in late November and early December.The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq composite were practically flat. However, losing stocks were outpacing winning issues by a nearly 4-to-3 margin on the Nasdaq. On the NYSE, winners and losers were roughly evenly matched. The Russell 2000 lost 0.2%.Volume was running mildly lower vs. the same time Monday on both main exchanges.While the medical sector remains a laggard, here are four stocks to consider for your watchlist. PRA Health (PRAH) is ranked No. 32 on the IBD 50. The stock edged 0.2% lower to 64.62, but is showing gains after busting through stubborn resistance at 60.The Raleigh, N.C., clinical trials firm has grown earnings per share 108%, 74%, 34%, 34%, 23% and 20% vs. year-ago levels in the past six quarters. Due in part to a tough year-over-year comparison, Wall Street sees earnings up just 9%, to 60 cents a share, in Q1.PRA holds a good 94 Composite Rating on a scale of 1 to 99 from IBD Stock Checkup.Celgene (CELG) has been trading quietly lately, but at 124.35 the top-performing biotech is still up nominally from a Feb. 28 breakout past a 122.49 cup-with-handle entry.Celgene is trading firmly above its 50-day moving average, which itself has been rising for more than six weeks. A 73 Relative Price Strength Rating is not superb, but it's a meaningful improvement from as low as 35 eight weeks ago. A 73 RS rating means that the large-cap biotech, which specializes in treatments for cancer and immunological disorders, is now outperforming 73% of all stocks in IBD's database over the past 12 months.Other notable leaders in IBD's biotech group are Incyte (INCY) and small-cap epilepsy and ADHD specialist Supernus Pharmaceuticals (SUPN). Both are up sharply for the year so far. A fourth  member of the biotech group is Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX), which rose 4% to 111.45 in heavy trading, four days after it zoomed up 20% in massive trading on positive clinical trial data regarding its two-pill treatment for cystic fibrosis.And Loveland, Colo.-based Heska (HSKA), a thinly traded expert in veterinary products, continues to soar after it cleared a 57.51 buy point in huge volume on Nov. 1.Keep in mind that Heska, up 2% to 104.37, trades just 102,000 shares a day. Elsewhere in the stock market today, InterActiveCorp (IAC) roared off its 50-day line, rising more than 2% to 75.73 in heavy volume.The search engine operator has found nice support at its 50-day for months, after the stock cleared a 60.40 buy point within a long bottoming-base pattern in October last year.On Feb. 2, InterActiveCorp staged a profit turnaround with fourth-quarter earnings rising 84% to $1.38 a share, crushing the consensus analyst estimate by nearly 47%, despite a 4% drop in sales. That halted a four-quarter streak of shrinking profits.Now, Wall Street has revised full-year EPS estimates higher, with 2017 earnings seen up 13% to $3.34 a share and 2018 earnings up 32% to $4.41.RELATED:Stock Market Today: Is It Time To Take Profits In These 5 Leading Techs?The Income Investor: Will These 3 Dividend Leaders Finish Big In 2017?Inside The IBD 50: These 7 Leaders Are Thriving, Even After Testing The 10-Week Moving Average

399,VRTX,"Tuesday's announcement that Celgene (CELG) agreed to acquire Receptos (RCPT) pleased investors in those two stocks, but for investors in Gilead Sciences (GILD), which was rumored to be interested in Receptos, it means waiting on the edges of their seats.""Literally the only question I'm getting on Gilead is, 'When and who are they going to buy?'"" said Evercore ISI analyst Mark Schoenebaum Monday in a video recorded for clients. ""The stock has moved because of broker meetings a month or two ago where they said, 'We're ready to do a deal.'""It's a crucial question for Gilead's future, because signs are that its blockbuster hepatitis C franchise is already hitting the ceiling in the U.S. after a record launch 18 months ago. However, that launch did give Gilead an enormous pile of cash to buy its next major drug line, which has set Wall Street's collective imagination into overdrive about what the target could be.Here are some of the most prominent suggestions that have come out in the last few months: Incyte (INCY): This was suggested on Tuesday by Nomura analyst Ian Somaiya in a note mainly about the Celgene-Receptos deal. Incyte's drug Jakafi treats a rare form of bone-marrow cancer as well as a blood disease called polycythemia vera. Gilead recently entered the blood-cancer market with Zydelig, which launched just shy of a year ago for chronic lymphocytic leukemia and two kinds of lymphoma. Somaiya noted that Incyte also has a promising pipeline that includes drugs for solid tumors.Incyte's 12-month revenue totaled $581 million, mostly from Jakafi, but the company has had inconsistent quarters on the bottom line. Analysts expect it to record its first annual profit next year, however, and grow rapidly after that. The stock has reflected these bullish expectations, with a Relative Strength Rating of 98 and an accumulation/distribution grade of B+. Incyte stock hit a new high of 121.70 early on the stock market today before retreating back near yesterday's close. Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX): Bernstein analyst Geoffrey Porges caused a minor commotion when he endorsed this combination back in April. Vertex, whose own hepatitis C blockbuster was stomped out of existence by Gilead, is positioning itself as the dominant player in cystic fibrosis, as it's the only company that's proven to have a disease-altering treatment for the devastating condition. Porges pointed out that Gilead already sells a product to this market called Cayston, so it has its foot in the door.Gilead ""needs the promise or high probability of an incremental $5 billion to $7 billion of revenue to reassure investors about their future outlook,"" Porges wrote at the time, and in fact $5 billion a year is what many predict Vertex's CF drugs are going to do eventually. However, some other analysts doubted whether such a deal would happen, on the grounds that Vertex is expensive (market cap is hovering near $33 billion, and Porges' suggested price was $45 billion) and Gilead prefers to buy development-stage assets that it can then launch itself.Vertex's stock has been in a flat base since Porges floated his idea. Achillion Pharmaceuticals (ACHN): Buying Achillion would be going in the opposite direction in terms of size, as Achillion is a startup whose market cap is just over $1 billion. However, it has been the subject of speculation, given that it has a promising hepatitis C drug candidate of its own, which could potentially help Gilead extend its franchise through the coming next generation of treatments.In November, after Achillion's candidate ACH-3102 yielded excellent six-week results in a clinical trial when combined with Gilead's Sovaldi, FBR Capital analyst Andrew Berens argued that buying Achillion could get Gilead onto ""(the) expected trend in HCV intervention towards shortened treatment durations from the currently available eight-week and 12-week courses."" Then in May, a Twitter-storm of speculation erupted when Achillion abruptly pulled out of an investor conference, suggesting that it was about to announce something big. As it turned out, it was: Achillion had actually signed a licensing deal with Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), which diminished the chances of a Gilead buyout. Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY): What, a biotech buying a big pharma? Well, actually Gilead is bigger than Bristol now — it did almost $25 billion in sales last year, vs. Bristol's $16 billion — and Bristol's hottest new drugs are biologics, like its cancer drug Opdivo. Which was what TheStreet.com's Adam Feuerstein was thinking when he proposed the idea back in January: ""I'm not sure exactly which company Gilead will buy, but the acquisition focus will be oncology, and it will be transformative, just as Pharmasset was for its hepatitis C business.""The potential is certainly vast, given that Opdivo alone is expected to pass $6.5 billion in annual sales by 2020. However, the price would be even more staggering than Vertex's, and Bristol's market value has continued to go up since Feuerstein's prediction; it's now over $115 billion. The stock hit a new 14-year high of 70.42 Wednesday before closing down more than 1%.Follow Amy Reeves on Twitter: @IBD_Areeves.

425,VRTX,"Gilead Sciences has been on a winning streak in recent years. But competition and price pressure may push the biotech pace-setter to go for acquisitions to continue the momentum.Gilead's (GILD) Q1 revenue climbed 52 percent from the year-earlier period, while the company's per-share earnings more than doubled. The Foster City, Calif.-based Gilead's annual sales total more than $27 billion, and through the past three years, market value has risen more than fivefold to reach an impressive $177 billion. The stock earns the best possible IBD Composite Rating, 99, which means that the stock has outperformed 99% of all other stocks in a combination of factors including Earnings Per Share and Relative Strength Ratings.Gilead has flourished by focusing on treating HIV and hepatitis patients. Hepatitis C drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni have chalked up more than half of the company's product sales.But a backlash has been building about Sovaldi, because Gilead has priced the drug at $1,000 per pill or $84,000 for the 12-week life of the treatment.""Any time you get a major move like that one, it's very hard for people to completely forget about it,"" said Michael Holland, head of New York money management firm Holland & Co. ""Management has the task of showing people that the biotech boom isn't ready to end yet — and that Gilead will continue to be a major player in the industry. They have to show the world that they have a strong and long-lasting growth strategy, just in case this kind of bad news surfaces again.""""Consumerism is growing in health care, and Gilead will surely feel pressure because of the prices it charges,"" said Paul Carroll, a partner with Devil's Advocate Group, a consulting firm for CEOs. ""This pressure will take some time to build, because any attempt to deny the use of medicine based on the cost brings people out of the woodwork shouting, 'Death panels!' Gilead needs to be preparing a 'doomsday scenario' to imagine what life will be like in a world when it can no longer charge $1,000 per pill.""Not everyone agrees. ""Despite the rhetoric surrounding Sovaldi, Gilead is in a very strong position strategically,"" says Dan Mendelson, CEO of health business advisor Avalere Health. ""It's in a strong position globally because Hep C is one of the big public health issues of our time.""As Dr. Barnett Mennen, a physician of long experience with the pharmaceutical industry, has said, Sovaldi ""has changed the game for many patients. They've offered a cure. How much is that worth to someone who is suffering?""Where Gilead Is VulnerableFactors other than price may put pressure on Gilead. The company's shares plunged about 15 percent last Dec. 22, reaching a four-month low, after the FDA approved rival AbbVie's (ABBV) hepatitis-C product.Around the same time, AbbVie forged an agreement with Express Scripts (ESRX) to offer its drug at a lower price. It became the only hepatitis-C product that the big pharmacy-benefit entity sanctioned.Industry observers say that Gilead can handle the pressure. ""It may be looking at a few acquisition targets"" as a way to lock in its continued solid growth, Brian Skorney, an analyst with Baird in Milwaukee, told IBD.Jacob Plieth, senior editorial analyst at EPVantage, also expects Gilead to pursue acquisitions. ""It's hard to know how else they can proceed. ... when you have a competitor coming in.""In a recent earnings conference call, Gilead COO and President John Milligan said, ""We typically like (acquiring companies) where we can have impact on phase three (drug trials) and where we can accelerate those products either into the approval process or integrator indications after the approval process. And I tend to think still we're looking for things where we feel we can catalyze the development of those products and have a greater utility over them overall.""Acquisition TargetsIn early May, Gilead acquired Danish drugmaker EpiTherapeutics. But which other companies would Gilead buy?Skorney is eyeing such potential takeover targets as South Boston, Mass.-based Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX), a global biotech entity that has drawn praise for its work in cystic fibrosis.Vertex could ""fit in nicely with Gilead,"" Skorney said, pointing out that Vertex has put its stamp on treating cystic fibrosis, much as Gilead has focused on hepatitis C. Also, Vertex has more than a dozen continuing programs targeted at other life-threatening diseases.Acquisitions are nothing new to Gilead. In 2011, the company announced an $11 billion acquisition of Pharmasset, giving it further range in treating hepatitis sufferers. The acquisition turned out to be a huge success.But not all acquisitions succeed. ""M&A remains dicey, and there is a long history of bad acquisitions in the pharmaceutical world,"" noted Carroll of Devil's Advocate.Nevertheless, EPVantage's Plieth said, ""Gilead is in a very strong position right now. It has been one of the most amazing biotech stocks, looking back over the past 10-12 years.""

426,VRTX,"An advisory panel to the Food and Drug Administration voted 12-1 in favor of approving Vertex Pharmaceuticals' (VRTX) cystic-fibrosis drug Orkambi Tuesday afternoon. The FDA has until July 5 to decide on approval, but it usually follows the recommendations of its panels.So much buzz surrounded the event that trading in Vertex stock was halted all day Tuesday while the panel debated the issues. Orkambi is a combination of Vertex's drug Kalydeco, which has already proven a hit treating patients with the rare G551D mutation, and lumacaftor, a product that can potentially expand it to use in the more common F508del mutation. Analysts predict multibillion-dollar sales eventually.Though the panel was generally expected to vote yes, the FDA's briefing documents, released Friday, raised some serious issues with the data. The benefit of the treatment was statistically significant but small. The patient pool involved was also not large, creating a real possibility that the panel would want Vertex to gather more data.The next question after approval, say analysts, is where Vertex is going to price the combo. Its pricing of Kalydeco at $300,000 a year was controversial but not completely out of line for drugs with small patient pools and rare yet serious diseases that payers are normally willing to shell out for. Some of the issues raised in the panel discussion, however, may come back to haunt Vertex, says Evercore ISI analyst Mark Schoenebaum, especially in single-payer Europe.""We believe the risk of regulatory non-approval is still low (NOT ZERO!), but that we should all bear in mind that some of the questions raised in the document could make reimbursement discussions outside the U.S. more difficult,"" Schoenebaum wrote in an email Friday.Vertex has been unprofitable the last two years, but the Orkambi launch is expected to right the ship, bringing a profit of $3.77 a share next year, according to analysts' estimates. The stock has a steep IBD Relative Strength Rating of 93 and a market cap north of $30 billion.Follow Amy Reeves on Twitter: @IBD_Areeves.

The Nasdaq composite led thanks to gains from biotechs and internet retailers.The Nasdaq composite held a 0.2% gain, the S&P 500 was about flat and the Dow Jones industrial average dipped 0.2%. The small cap Russell 2000 was down 0.2%. Volume was tracking slightly higher on the NYSE and Nasdaq in the stock market today vs. the same time Tuesday.Biotechs and retailers led, while steel and utilities lagged. Wal-Mart (WMT) and Merck (MRK), each up about 1%, were the top gainers on the Dow. But Home Depot (HD) and Travelers Cos.

Both stocks are in buy range from their respective entries. Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) soared more than 23% to 110.35 and a 14-month high, gapping up past a 95.10 buy point of a bottoming base in massive trade.The biotech late Tuesday said clinical trials for a drug combo of tezacaftor and Kalydeco to treat cystic fibrosis showed positive results. It plans to seek marketing approval from the FDA and the European Medicines Agency.Dave & Buster's (PLAY) fell 4% in heavy turnover, dropping the stock back to 60.02 and into buy range from a 58.35 flat-base entry. After the close Tuesday, the restaurant and arcade chain reported Q4 results that topped views on the top and bottom lines. But the midpoint of its full-year revenue outlook was slightly below the Street's consensus estimates. Ollie's Bargain Outlet (OLLI) popped nearly 4% in fast turnover. Shares remain in buy range from a 33.55 flat-base entry.The deep discount retailer late Tuesday reported better-than-expected Q4 per-share earnings and sales, extending double-digit gains on both for a 13th straight quarter.Its full-year EPS outlook and the midpoint of its revenue guidance range were higher than consensus. Lululemon Athletica (LULU) gained 1% ahead of its Q4 earnings report after the close. Analysts expect the yoga wear maker to earn $1.01 a share on $783.6 million in sales. That would mark respective year-over-year increases of 19% and 11%.RELATED:Dave & Buster's Guides Light After Q4 Beats; Ollie's Tops, Guides HighDow's JPMorgan Retakes Key Support; Tesla In Focus: Investing Action PlanVertex Stock Rockets On Strong Cystic Fibrosis Data

U.S. legislators also weighed in, approving a bill late Tuesday that would permit much broader use of consumer data by internet service providers. Rising oil prices, analyst upgrades and downgrades, and the season's slowing trickle of earnings reports also had their say on today's stock market action.Department stores, ranked dead last among IBD's 197 industry groups, scored Tuesday's best gain among industries.

RH (RH), formerly Restoration Hardware, was the big winner here, marking up a 15% gain. The high-end-furnishings retailer reported fourth-quarter revenue and earnings declines slightly better than its pre-announced guidance. Management's first-quarter revenue guidance was well above consensus projections.Williams Sonoma (WSM) caught some of the updraft, posting a 4% gain in heavy trade — enough to retake support at the stock's 200-day moving average.Chevron (CVX) led the Dow industrials, up 0.8% and aided by a 2% pop in oil prices. UnitedHealth (UNH) notched the Dow's weakest move, down 1.1%.The S&P 500's top dog Wednesday was Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX). The Boston-based biotech vaulted 20% higher after reporting positive results from clinical trials of its experimental cystic fibrosis treatment pill combining tezacaftor and ivacaftor. The gain sent shares beyond buy range above a double-bottom-base buy point of 98.03Amazon.com (AMZN) led the FANG group of big tech names, rising 2.2% in firm trade.

436,VRTX,"Biotechs have a lot riding on drug data in 2017.IBD's 421-company Medical-Biomed/Biotech industry group plunged 25% in 2016 after a rocky election year. Relief that Hillary Clinton lost the White House spiked the group nearly 17% in the week following the election, but those gains have since dissipated on Donald Trump's pledge to tackle rising drug prices.The group has faced challenges at its 50-day moving average since April. Meanwhile, large caps like Amgen (AMGN) and Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) are trading at 10%-15% of their no-pipeline valuations, according to RBC analyst Michael Yee. Tugging sentiment out of its 12-month low will require either M&A or strong drug data.""M&A remains a potential coiled spring catalyst if one to two companies could go into play and many large pharmas continue to be on the hunt,"" Yee wrote in a Dec. 29 research report. He sees Ariad Pharmaceuticals (ARIA), Incyte (INCY), Tesaro (TSRO) and BioMarin (BMRN) as possible acquisition targets.Outside M&A, Yee said, there's a ""lack of material catalysts to get the sector moving.""IBD'S TAKE: Five top biotechs ended 2016 with triple-digit gains, outplaying the broader industry. Are your biotech picks on that list? Check out IBD's Industry Themes for the deeper dive.But nearly two dozen biotech companies this year are slated to post key drug trials data in just four key arenas: drugs to treat spinal muscular atrophy, drugs to treat cystic fibrosis, PARP inhibitors to treat several types of cancers and therapies to treat lymphoma.Success could turn sentiment positive for the second, but failure could weigh on many drug stocks.Spinal muscular atrophy — which results in the wasting away of muscle and can lead to early death — will see the least new data in 2017 of the four sectors, but it also will host what Yee, in a recent research report, calls the overall drug industry's ""only new real launch"" this year.Biogen (BIIB) and Ionis Pharmaceuticals (IONS) teamed up to develop Spinraza, the brand name for nusinersen, a drug that targets a single RNA to treat the symptoms of SMA, Ionis CEO Stanley Crooke told IBD in a recent Q&A.Biogen exercised its worldwide rights to Spinraza in August. The Food and Drug Administration approved Spinraza in late December. It's the first SMA treatment to get FDA approval and Crooke said he expects Biogen to bring the drug to market early this year.He describes SMA as a ""diabolical"" disease that chemically denervates the body. It can be fatal in infants and progresses in toddlers, robbing them of the ability to walk, eat or breathe on their own. It affects the motor nerve cells in the spinal cord, according to Cure SMA.After Spinraza's launch, midcap Cytokinetics (CYTK) is expected to release the results of a phase 2 trial on CK-2127107, which it describes as a ""novel skeletal muscle troponin activator"" that could help treat SMA patients and others suffering similar degeneration.CK-2127107 differs from Spinraza in that it aims to slow the rate of calcium release from the regulatory troponin complex of fast skeletal muscle fibers. It's in two phase 2 trials, one examining SMA patients and one looking at patients with chronic lung disease, with trial results for the latter further in the future.Cytokinetics is a lightly traded small cap, but has an IBD Relative Strength Rating of 79 out of a best-possible 99. The stock crept into a buy zone in late December, hitting a 12.65 entry point out of a cup-with-handle formation, but has slipped to 10.60 as of Thursday's close, triggering the sell rule anytime a stock falls at least 8% from a buy point Shares rose 16% in 2016.A handful of cystic fibrosis trials are expected to wrap up in 2017 — but Vertex's ""triple pill"" has sparked the most analyst chatter. Both Yee and Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan say phase 2 data for VX-152 and VX-440 are likely to be available in the latter half of 2017 and another trial's results out sooner.VX-152, VX-440 and VX-661 are being investigated as a three-prong treatment for cystic fibrosis, a genetic disease that causes mucus to collect, blocking the airways and damaging the digestive system. VX-661 is in phase 3 testing with results from two patient populations expected in the first half of the year.Yee estimates VX-152, VX-440 and VX-661 could add $1 billion to $2 billion in long-term sales for Vertex. He sees ""a fairly good chance the 'triple' will work in the second half of 2017, driving the company's growth. But, he notes that investors remain wary. Vertex stock fell 41% in 2016, but it is up 9.8% this year after falling 2% to 80.91 on Thursday.Vertex is far from alone in the cystic fibrosis game. As many as seven other publicly-traded biotechs are expected to release clinical trial data in 2017. Mid-cap biotech PCT Therapeutics (PCTC) appears furthest along, with phase 3 data for its Translarna due this quarter.The PCT trial examines CF patients with nonsense mutations. According to Cystic Fibrosis News, Translarna could potentially make the cellular protein machinery run the ""so-called stop sign in the CF-causing CFTR gene, replacing it with amino acids similar enough to allow the protein to do its work.""Clovis Oncology (CLVS) pulled ahead of Tesaro in late December when the FDA granted accelerated approval to its PARP inhibitor, rupacarib. A day later, the FDA gave Tesaro's PARP inhibitor, niraparib, priority review. The two are duking it out to rival Lynparza, a PARP inhibitor approved in 2014 from AstraZeneca (AZN).Both are deadlocked in a race to treat ovarian and breast cancer. Clovis is on track to unveil phase 3 data for rupacarib — which will sell under the brand name Rubraca — in patients with a BRCA-like mutation in the latter half of 2017. BRCA mutations are often associated with breast cancer.Tesaro's niraparib is on deck for phase 3 breast cancer and phase 2 ovarian cancer data in the second half of 2017. Niraparib has a Prescription Drug Free User (PDUFA) date of June 30, according to Biopharma Catalyst's FDA tracker.Niraparib, rupacarib and olaparib (the chemical name for AstraZeneca's Lynparza) belong to a class of drugs called PARP inhibitors. Several forms of cancer are dependent on PARPs, a type of enzyme. By inhibiting those enzymes, companies like Clovis, Tesaro and AstraZeneca hope to treat several cancers.AbbVie (ABBV) and Pfizer (PFE), via its acquisition of Medivation, also are working on PARP inhibitors.AbbVie's veliparib missed several endpoints, including progression-free survival (PFS), in a phase 2 trial of recurrent and metastatic breast cancer with BRCA mutations unveiled in early December. Phase 3 testing is underway. Veliparib is also being investigated as a treatment for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).Pfizer acquired Medivation for $14 billion in September. Medivation's talazoparib is in development to treat breast cancer with germ line BRCA mutations. But neither AbbVie nor Pfizer's PARP inhibitors are expected to have data in 2017.Ariad, Kite Pharma (KITE) and Seattle Genetics (SGEN) look poised to lead 2017 in the lymphoma battle — though as many as 10 publicly-traded biotechs are expected to present data this year on varying drugs.Next month, Kite's KTE-C19 will likely come away with ""solid"" six-month durability data in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), says RBC's Yee. That could lead to a rolling Biologics License Agreement (BLA) in Q1 and a PDUFA date before year-end.KTE-C19 belongs to a class of drugs called CAR T-cell therapies. These drugs teach a patient's immune system to fight off specific cancers. Kite's drug is being investigated as a treatment for refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma.Ariad Pharma, on the other hand, already has a PDUFA date of April 29 for its brigatinib, a treatment for anaplastic lymphoma kinase positive (ALK+) metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) resistant to crizotinib, a Pfizer chemotherapy.Though the PDUFA date is in April, first-line data won't be available until 2018-19. Competitor Roche (RHHBY) has similar data for a rival drug due in that same time frame. Ariad completed the New Drug Application (NDA) for brigatinib in October.Also in 2017, Seattle Genetics is angling for a fourth indication for its 2011-approved Adcetris. Adcetris is being examined as a treatment for cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL). It will also unveil the results of a yearlong phase 3 trial of Adcetris and chemotherapy in front-line Hodgkin lymphoma.Seattle Genetics is trying to establish ""a redefined front-line therapy in Hodgkin lymphoma after nearly 40 years of the same therapy,"" CEO Clay Siegall told IBD in a recent interview.RELATED:Investors Siphon Biogen, Ionis Gains After Spinal Disease Drug's OKIonis Pharma Eyes Sustainable Profitability After FDA ApprovalAmgen Plans Robust 2017 In Alzheimer's, Migraines, Oncology: CEO ExclusiveBristol-Myers Won't Seek Accelerated Opdivo Lung Cancer OK

437,VRTX,"No. 2 biotech Gilead Sciences (GILD) will likely guide to declining 2017 sales, hamstrung on limited Hepatitis C visibility, RBC analyst Michael Yee said Wednesday, noting expectations are better for Amgen (AMGN) and Biogen (BIIB), as the Q4 earnings season gets underway.For 2017, Yee expects Gilead to guide to $27 billion to $29 billion in product sales, bracketing consensus views for $28 billion. That would be down 8% at the midpoint of guidance vs. early 2016 guidance for $30 billion to $31 billion.""We appreciate that visibility is tough on Hep C right now, but buy-side consensus is also fairly low on Gilead given known uncertainties,"" Yee wrote in a research report. He predicts a decline of more than $1 billion in 2017 Hep C sales.Gilead makes Sovaldi and Harvoni to combat Hep C. In the U.S., though, prescriptions of Hep C drugs fell 6%-7% quarter over quarter in Q4, according to market tracker IMS. Europe remains a ""wild card,"" but the Q3 volume of patients fell markedly from Q2, Yee wrote.""This is an ongoing concern given the bolus continues to wear down in EU as the launches have occurred in major regions over the past year or so,"" he wrote in a note to clients. ""Merck is now launching in a number of regions with possible lower pricing.""IBD'S TAKE: A small biotech and four IPOs outlasted giants like Amgen and Biogen to top 2016 stock gains among companies that started the year above 10 and traded an average daily volume of 10,000 shares. Was your pick among them? Check out IBD's Industry Themes.For Q4, Yee expects Gilead to report $7.2 billion in sales, a tick above broader consensus views for $7.1 billion. The consensus of 28 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expects Gilead to report $2.62 earnings per share ex items. Yee sees $2.59.Gilead is set to report its Q4 earnings and issue 2017 guidance after hours Feb. 7. Among big biotechs, Amgen and Biogen are ""set up well into (earnings per share) and guidance where there is current investor uncertainty and nervousness,"" Yee says.Amgen, which is scheduled to report late Feb. 2, is widely modeled at $5.8 billion in sales and $2.79 EPS minus items. Then, Amgen could report data from its (cardiovascular outcomes trial) CVOT in PCSK9 inhibitor Repatha, Yee wrote.""Whenever the CVOT data is out we see a 20%-25% CVOT benefit with higher-end stock trading up 3-5%,"" he wrote. The ""Street will want to own names that can hit earnings and give good guidance, and CVOT data is 'de-risking.'""For Biogen, 25 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters view $2.94 billion in sales and $4.98 EPS minus items. Yee sees $2.9 billion and $4.68. Biogen is set to report early Jan. 26.Biogen's story is clearer after it settled a patent dispute over Tecfidera with Forward Pharma (FWP). The company will also likely discuss its spinoff of its hemophilia unit into Bioverativ. The spinoff should cut sales and EPS minus items by $900 million and 50 cents to $1.Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) and Celgene (CELG) are slated to report their Q4 earnings late Jan. 25 and early Jan. 26, respectively. Both preannounced financial results during the annual JPMorgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco.Cystic fibrosis drug sales grew to $1.68 billion in 2016, Vertex said. For Q4, CF drugs Orkambi and Kalydeco pulled in $453 million.Celgene preannounced net sales of $11.19 billion, up 22%, for 2016. The company also guided to $13 billion to $13.4 billion in 2017 sales, up 18% at the midpoint of the outlook.

438,VRTX,"Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) fell early Monday, before reversing sharply later in the session,  after the company's forecast for sales of its cystic fibrosis drug Orkambi lagged Wall Street expectations.On Sunday, Vertex said it expected full-year sales of $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion for the drug, while analysts had been forecasting $1.45 billion, Evercore ISI analyst John Scotti said in an email to clients on Sunday. But Scotti said Vertex's numbers were ""likely closer"" to the expectations of buy-side analysts (mutual funds, pension funds, hedge funds and others).Vertex released its forecast ahead of its presentation Monday at the 35th annual JPMorgan (JPM) Healthcare Conference, which is one of the biggest events of the year for biotech and other drug companies. The conference, in San Francisco, starts Monday and ends Thursday, and most of the major companies will be present.Other companies with executives making presentations Monday include Amgen (AMGN), Biogen (BIIB) and Celgene (CELG).IBD'S TAKE: It's rare that not a single drugmaker is on the IBD 50 list of top-performing stocks, but that is the case at this time of uncertainty for an industry facing possibly changes in health care laws and perhaps, as IBD has reported, legislation on drug prices. Check out IBD 50 to learn which stocks have been performing better than any others.Vertex stock fell as much as 2.9% in early trading in the stock market today, but it ended the day at 82.86, up 4.4%, regaining its 50-day moving average for the first time since November. Vertex stock had a rough 2016, with shares falling more than 40% as some quarterly results disappointed and it had mixed results with its drug trials.The company's Q1 sales outlook for Orkambi, launched in 2015, also missed Wall Street forecasts.In any case, with sales of $1 billion-plus, Orkambi is a blockbuster. It's a combination of ivacaftor, another treatment for cystic fibrosis that Vertex markets separately as Kalydeco, and lumacaftor, a booster that makes the drug effective in treating a much larger population than ivacaftor alone. Annual treatments for both Orkambi and Kalydeco cost $200,000 plus.Vertex's guidance for 2017 sales of Kalydeco at $690 million to $710 million also missed, with Wall Street expecting $734 million, Scotti said.RELATED:Trump Pledges To Bring Down Drug PricesWhich Biotechs Outperformed In Tough 2016

439,VRTX,"Data from No. 1 biotech Amgen's (AMGN) LDL-busting drug could boost Regeneron (REGN) in 2017, but disappoint the too-high expectations of Amgen investors, Credit Suisse analyst Alethia Young said Tuesday.Young upgraded Regeneron stock to an outperform rating and upped her price target to 485 from 481, citing the April launch of dupixent, an eczema drug with Sanofi (SNY). But PCSK9 data from top rival Amgen due in Q1 also could also be a catalyst for Regeneron's own PCSK9 drug, she wrote in a research report.Amgen investors, however, have set their expectations too high on Repatha, Amgen's PCSK9 inhibitor, following successful data from a study in September, she said. In that coronary intravascular imaging trial, Repatha met its primary and secondary endpoints in coronary artery disease.""We still see some upside into Repatha outcomes data in 1Q17,"" she wrote in a research note. ""We think the risk/reward is unfavorable since expectations are pretty high after success of the GLAGOV study.""IBD'S TAKE: Will Trump break with Republicans to pressure drug prices? It's looking more and more likely he will. Will biotechs survive the political pressure?Young downgraded Amgen stock to a neutral rating and cut her price target to 180 from 200. She sees Amgen's base business — rheumatoid arthritis drug Enbrel — becoming weaker and trimmed her total product-sales view by $670 million.Enbrel sales came in flat in Q3 at $1.45 billion amid contract negotiations. Next year, Enbrel sales will be driven on volume rather than net selling price, the company said on its Q3 earnings conference call with analysts. Though the company upped its 2016 guidance at that time.Celgene (CELG) and Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) top Young's 2017 biotech watchlist. She is cautious on 2017 in general, however, given comments from President-elect Donald Trump that he will go after escalating drug prices. In the six weeks following his election, biotech and drug stocks have nearly round-tripped, first rising and then falling.IBD's 421-company Medical-Biomed/Biotech industry group hit a six-week high on Nov. 14 after Trump's election, but is down 9% since then. Still, shares remain 5% above their close on Nov. 8, rising 0.85% in the stock market today. Amgen stock fell 0.35% Tuesday to 147.22, while Regeneron stock slipped 0.20% to 371.02.""We don't expect drug pricing chatter to moderate, especially considering comments already made by the president-elect,"" Young wrote. ""We think that the companies with the best execution should have the best stock performance in 2017."" RELATED:Amgen, Biogen, Celgene Eye M&A In Trump's 'Pro-Biotech' WorldBiotechs Climb For Third Straight Day; Which Leaders Are Buyable?
"
440,VRTX,"Amgen (AMGN), Biogen (BIIB), Celgene (CELG) and Gilead Sciences (GILD) could look to M&A following Donald Trump's election as 2017 sets up with fewer regulatory hurdles and a likely biotech resurgence, RBC analyst Michael Yee said Monday.Biotech stocks have surged since Trump's election, largely on the notion that he will be less likely to pressure drug prices than Hillary Clinton and likely to push business-friendly legislation, including tax incentives to repatriate cash to the U.S.With the election uncertainty over, Yee expects the big four biotechs to make good on M&A plans as capital remains inexpensive and organic growth slows. Trump appears poised to embrace innovation within his administration, Yee wrote in a research report Monday.IBD'S TAKE: Biotechs aren't alone in experiencing a Trump effect. Defensive stocks are on a furious upswing following the election. Should you get in on these five defensive stocks now? Get IBD's Industry Themes for the answer.To that end, Trump met with Patrick Soon-Shiong over the weekend. Soon-Shiong is a biotech exec and the former CEO of Abraxis BioScience, which Celgene acquired in 2010 for $3 billion. There's no telling what will come of Trump's meeting with Soon-Shiong, Yee noted.Regardless, investors are starting to key in on the pro-biz environment. Since the election, shares of IBD's 421-company Medical-Biomed/Biotech industry group and the SPDR S&P Biotech ETF (XBI) are nearly 15%. The iShares Nasdaq Biotech ETF (IBB) is up more than 9%.""Barring any big policy surprises out of Trump, there is an increased feeling of pro-business including pro-biotech within the GOP,"" Yee wrote. ""So we see it as unlikely that any major legislation should derail innovation.""Those increases are merely the beginning, Yee wrote, noting, ""If good things happen, we believe stocks can go much higher."" Alzheimer's data in late 2017 or early 2018 from Eli Lilly (LLY) could be a catalyst. Biotechs will also likely update 2017 guidance in January, potentially pushing stocks higher.No. 3 biotech Celgene is most de-risked in the postelection world, with no near-term catalysts and no ""fear of any big disappointments,"" Yee wrote. Celgene has multiple sclerosis data due in the first half of 2017, but likely won't raise 2020 guidance in January.But Celgene stock could dip on a dilutive deal, he noted.""We'd view any pullback as a buying opportunity because the long-term tail question is sufficient pipeline — and that's what long-term investors want to see (near-term earnings variance is less important than tail questions),"" he wrote.Meanwhile, Amgen and Biogen will likely ""be OK,"" but uncertainty remains on shares of BioMarin Pharmaceutical (BMRN) and Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX), Yee wrote.Biogen stock could bound on strong Alzheimer's results from Eli Lilly. Amgen stock is still suffering the fallout of Q3 commentary on Enbrel pricing in 2017.On the stock market today, Celgene stock lifted 1.8% to 124.14. Shares of Amgen, Biogen and Gilead were all up a fraction. Vertex stock was down 0.4%, with BioMarin shares down 1.7% to 87.50.RELATED:Can This Small-Cap Biotech Take On Gilead, Celgene, Biogen In Alzheimer's?

494,VRTX,"Antenna developer Airgain (AIRG) soared Monday for the second straight trading day following its third-quarter earnings results late Thursday that beat estimates.Airgain stock spiked 27.5% to 19.45, hitting a record high on the stock market today. On Friday, Airgain climbed 7%. The San Diego-based company recently made its initial public offering without much fanfare. It raised $12 million by offering 1.5 million shares at 8, which is where the stock ended on its first day of trading on Aug 12.After the close Thursday, Airgain reported earnings per share minus items of 16 cents, smashing the consensus estimate of a 1-cent loss.

495,VRTX,"Although Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) missed Wall Street's Q3 views late Tuesday, shares rose for a time Wednesday on the $1 billion potential upside as Vertex sends two cystic fibrosis drugs to phase 2 testing.At the closing bell on the stock market today, however, Vertex stock, which had risen more than 5% earlier, ended trading flat at 78.71. IBD's 421-company Medical-Biomed/Biotech industry group also was down a fraction, heading for possibly a fourth straight down day.Vertex's stock for a time rose on confidence for VX-152 and VX-440, next-generation correctors for cystic fibrosis, rather than on its Q3 metrics, which narrowly missed the Street's expectations. Vertex also plans to send two additional CF meds into phase 1 testing by year's end and early next year.""This is an important fundamental step to getting closer to a new mega-franchise that could increase consensus peak sales and add new revenue growth to go after the 30% of the CF market that is not currently addressed,"" RBC analyst Michael Yee wrote in a research report.Yee kept his outperform rating on Vertex stock.IBD'S TAKE: M&A activity and clinical trials could have biotechs on the edge of a big rebound. Keep tabs on the Industry Snapshot for other red-hot sectors.For Q3, Vertex reported $413.78 million in sales, growing 34% from the year-earlier quarter, and 16 cents earnings per share ex items, swinging from a 13-cent loss. Analysts polled by FactSet had modeled $417.3 million and 18 cents.CF meds Orkambi and Kalydeco brought in $234 million and $176 million in sales, respectively, growing 79% and 6% vs. the year-earlier quarter. Orkambi narrowly beat the consensus of $233 million, but Kalydeco missed the $179 million view, Yee wrote.VX-152 and VX-440 are expected to start phase 2 testing before year's end. Safety remains a major concern, Evercore analyst John Scotti wrote in a report. VX-440 could be teratogenic (able to halt a pregnancy) and VX-152 caused some nausea and vomiting.In phase 2 testing, pregnant patients are excluded from VX-440 and all females will be required to be on non-hormonal birth control. VX-440 will be tested for two weeks; VX-152 for two weeks based on differing therapeutic windows, Vertex said.Credit Suisse analyst Alethia Young boosted her price target Wednesday on Vertex stock to 115 from 110, and sees a 75%-100% upside should phase 2 testing for VX-440 and X-152 support efficacy. She has an outperform rating on Vertex stock.RELATED:Pfizer-Medivation Deal Reignites Biotech Buyout SpeculationVertex Stock Slips On Drug Trial Failure, Though Not A Surprise

496,VRTX,"President-elect Donald Trump is likely to take on the Affordable Care Act, meaning biotech and drug stocks aren't in the clear following Hillary Clinton's defeat, analysts said Wednesday, after a year of political pressure on the industry.Though Clinton was seen more likely to wage bureaucratic battle against ""excessive"" drug prices than Trump, the Republican and his allies have repeatedly blasted the ACA -- known as ObamaCare -- with the president-elect promising he would ""repeal it, replace it and get something great.""""This legislation ... has tragically but predictably resulted in runaway costs, websites that don't work, greater rationing of care, higher premiums, less competition and fewer choices,"" Trump says on his website. ""ObamaCare has raised the economic uncertainty of every single person residing in this country.""Trump proposes a system based on ""free-market principles,"" but hasn't delved into specifics. On Tuesday, Republicans also retained a majority in the House and Senate, making Trump's path to repeal the ACA easier. How any such repeal would hurt drug stocks is unknown, but it adds uncertainty to the industry and could weigh.IBD'S TAKE: Biogen could be heading for a breakout on an experimental spinal muscular atrophy drug in partnership with Ionis. How close is Biogen stock? Check out Industry Themes for the skinny.Hospital stocks tanked Wednesday on the trump win, but biotech and drug stocks rode the anti-Clinton wave, rising on the likelihood Trump won't go after excessive drug prices and, with a Republican Congress, probably won't touch Medicare reform.IBD's 421-company Biomed/Biotech industry group jumped 9.7% in midday trading on the stock market today, while the 44-company Ethical Drugs climbed 5.7% and 18-company Generic Drugs group surged 7%. As of Tuesday's close, the groups had been down 26%, 27% and 29%, respectively, for the year.But their lift will likely be short-lived, RBC analyst Michael Yee said, advising that investors buy on the Brexit-like dip. The broader market will likely assume ""a risk-off environment and sell-off in the short term with 'Trump uncertainty' emotion,"" he said.But ""biotechs should bounce since we don't see anything that fundamentally was negative for biotech,"" Yee wrote in a research report.He recommends Celgene (CELG), Biogen (BIIB), Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX), BioMarin (BMRN) and Prothena (PRTA) stocks.Of those, BioMarin and Vertex led the way midday Wednesday, with Vertex soaring by 11.9% and BioMarin surging 10.1%. Celgene stock skipped to a 10.7% gain%, Prothena catapulted 18% and Biogen climbed 8.2%.Tuesday's election resulted in a ""best case scenario"" for biotechs, Yee said. Besides a president and a Congress less likely to meddle in drug pricing, Proposition 61 in California failed 54%-46%. Prop 61 would have limited state agency spending on prescriptions to what the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs pays.Sen. Bernie Sanders, who lost to Clinton in the primary, was a major proponent of Prop 61. But in the Republican Senate, Sanders' name is likely to lose some of its power. Yee sees it's unlikely he'll be tapped to chair the Health, Labor, Education, Pension (HELP) committee.RELATED:Drug Stocks Rally On Relief Clinton Didn't Win White HouseClean-Energy Stocks Plunge On Trump WinApple, Microsoft Eye Trump's Overseas Cash Tax Plan

497,VRTX,"Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) remains ahead of Galapagos (GLPG) in developing a triple of drugs to treat cystic fibrosis, RBC analyst Michael Yee said Thursday after Galapagos unveiled positive phase 2 data for its first CF pill.Galapagos' GLPG-1837 lowered FEV1 ""in-line"" with data from Vertex's Kalydeco. FEV1 is a ratio used in the diagnosis of obstructive and restrictive lung disease. GLPG-1837 and Kalydeco belong to a class of drugs called potentiators.But developing a triple is no easy feat, Yee wrote in a research report. Galapagos' and AbbVie's (ABBV) backup potentiator moved into phase 1 testing earlier this year. Its corrector, GLPG-2222, is currently in phase 1/2 testing.""This is only one CF drug and in order to have a 'triple pill' the companies have to have all three drugs look good and in combination all together in patients -- and have minimal drug-drug interactions or safety issues when dosed all at once,"" Yee wrote.Galapagos' third piece of the triple pill hasn't yet started phase 1 testing, Yee wrote. And its phase 2 test involved only seven patients who had previously been treated with Kalydeco. It's a little early to say GLPG-1837 has been derisked, Yee says.""So three drugs will not be in combination until back half of 2017, in our view,"" he wrote. He estimates Vertex is one to two years ahead after already derisking two of its three drugs. VX-152 and VX-440 -- in contention to become the third -- will begin phase 2 testing before year's end.Yee kept his outperform rating on Vertex stock. He sees the ""mega-franchise"" in CF as having a $1 billion potential upside. Vertex stock fell 3.65% to close at 75.84 on the stock market today, hitting the lowest in more than two years. Galapagos fell 2% to 62.68.IBD'S TAKE: The biotech sector isn't looking so hot now after IBD's 421-company Medical-Biomed/Biotech industry group sank to No. 21 out of 197 groups tracked from No. 9 over four weeks. The 54-company Aerospace/Defense industry group, though, could be a better bet.

498,VRTX,"Shares of big-cap biotech Vertex Pharmaceuticals fell Monday after the results on its latest cystic fibrosis drug disappointed investors. Vertex (VRTX) reported data from a mid stage study combining drug candidate VX-661 with the al ready-marketed ivacaftor, branded Kalydeco, in patients with cystic fibrosis caused by homozygous F508del mutation. Vertex's other products already treat this population, but the firm hopes VX-661 can be expanded into the harder-to-treat heterozygous F508del mutation population.
"
499,VRTX,"""Consistent with prior Phase 2 studies that evaluated 4 weeks of treatment with VX-661 in combination with ivacaftor, this study showed a rapid improvement in lung function within four weeks of treatment, and after patients completed treatment, lung function returned to baseline,"" Vertex's press release summarized.
"
500,VRTX,"But RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee disagreed that it was really that consistent.

518,VRTX,"Biotech stocks continued to slide Thursday, prompting analysts to weigh in on the causes and prognosis for the sector.Piper Jaffray's Joshua Schimmer noted that the same thing happened about a year ago, sparked by the price debate over Gilead Sciences' (GILD) hepatitis C drug Sovaldi, but also by valuation concerns after a long runup.""Obviously 2014 turned out to be a stellar year for biotech, and we believe industry fundamentals remain strong,"" he wrote in his research note. ""2015 should still be a good year for the industry, once we pass through this latest round of selling.""Schimmer wrote that profitable big caps such as Celgene (CELG), Biogen (BIIB) and Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) are ""attractively valued relative to peers.""On the other hand, he said money-losing big caps such as Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) and BioMarin Pharmaceuticals (BMRN) are more difficult to value.RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee, in his report, wrote that ""it's reasonable and makes sense to us that some correction and profit taking has been possible given the significant outperformance in the first 3 months of 2015.""Yee noted that there were some ""over-exaggerated"" moves by some of the smaller biotechs last week, such as the CAR-T stocks (Juno Therapeutics (JUNO) jumped 24% and Kite Pharma (KITE) rose 14%), which in turn revived long-running concerns about a biotech bubble.Kite stock was down 10% in midday trading in the stock market today, while Juno stock was down 2% after falling more than 7% Wednesday.Yee added, however, that real bear markets are driven by poor fundamentals, which he says aren't evident yet in biotech.""We're watching our '3 pillars of risk': biosimilars (in flux), pricing/rebating, and IP risks, but these seem to be risks to individual companies but not to the whole sector,"" he wrote.Thursday marks the fifth straight trading-day decline for IBD's 368-company Medical-Biomed/Biotech group, which has slumped nearly 12% in that span.

Shares of the restaurant operator have been on a tear since coming off a low in October, rising more than 80%. But the stock has yet to form a proper base. In February, Red Robin reported a 17% rise in fiscal Q4 sales, marking the biggest gain in two years, as well as the second straight period of acceleration.Avago Technologies (AVGO) cooled off from a new high, trimming a 2% gain by more than half. Earlier in the stock market today, Citigroup raised its price target to 160 from 131.

On the other hand, revenue of $144.6 million, down 59% from the prior year, beat consensus by $7 million.Maxim Group analyst Jason Kolbert downgraded Vertex to hold from buy, largely because he had rebuilt his model and not because of the earnings report. He pointed to the risks associated with Vertex's cystic-fibrosis program, which is its main focus now that hep C is out, and he derived a price target of 121, which is right about where the stock closed Wednesday.Needham analyst Alan Carr also downgraded to hold on valuation concerns, as the stock was trading near all-time highs before Thursday's drop.Meanwhile, Celgene reported Q4 results in line with what it had preannounced this month, though sales turned out to be slightly higher ($2.085 billion vs. $2.05 billion). It affirmed its previous 2015 guidance. By late morning, Celgene stock was down 0.6% intraday.Fellow big-cap biotech Biogen Idec (BIIB) is due to report after the close Thursday. Analysts estimate that Biogen's earnings jumped 62% to $3.78 a share, with sales rising 34% to $2.64 billion.Biogen stock fell 1.1% intraday.Follow Amy Reeves on Twitter: @IBD_Areeves.

546,VRTX,"Vertex Pharmaceuticals sailed through one of the most crucial tests in its 25-year existence when its cystic fibrosis (CF) treatment hit goals in a late-stage study. Upon disclosure Tuesday, Vertex stock soared to a 14-year high, closing up 40.4% to 93.53.
"
547,VRTX,"Vertex (VRTX) pooled results from two phase three clinical trials looking at patients with a homozygous pair of genes with the F508del genetic mutation, the most common cause of cystic fibrosis. Patients taking a combination of lumacaftor and ivacaftor for 24 weeks showed a statistically significant improvement in lung function as well as a significant reduction in the rates of pulmonary exacerbations and improvements in body mass.
"
548,VRTX,"""These pivotal results validate our strategy of using a combination of a corrector, lumacaftor, and a potentiator, ivacaftor, to treat the underlying cause of CF,"" Vertex CEO Jeffrey Leiden told analysts Tuesday.
"
549,VRTX,"The company plans to file for approval in both the U.S. and Europe in Q4. Analysts say it will probably launch in mid-2015.
"
550,VRTX,"Wall Street Hesitated
"
551,VRTX,"The size of the stock move reflects how uncertain Wall Street was that the treatment would work, as well as how significant the news is for Vertex. In 2011, Vertex enjoyed what was, at the time, the biggest drug launch in history with its hepatitis C treatment Incivek. But a year later, sales fell sharply as competition came online, especially Gilead Sciences' (GILD) Sovaldi, which has already surpassed Incivek's launch record since it was approved in December.
"
552,VRTX,"In 2012 ivacaftor, one of the two drugs in the latest study, was approved for sale as Kalydeco. But it was approved only for patients with the G551D mutation. They represent only 4% of CF sufferers in the U.S., according to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation.
"
553,VRTX,"Thanks partly to controversially aggressive pricing — around $300,000 a year — Vertex still has been able to pull hundreds of millions in annual revenue off a patient base of just a few thousand. But being able to treat the 50,000 or so patients with the F508del mutation, whether homozygous or heterozygous, would turn ivacaftor into a blockbuster.
"
554,VRTX,"Nonetheless, prior trial results didn't inspire full confidence. Just last week, Bernstein analyst Geoffrey Porges warned of a high risk of failure, based on talks with scientists at a CF conference.
"
555,VRTX,"On Tuesday, ISI Group analyst Mark Schoenebaum wrote that while the results were ""not a home run"" due to the modest rate of lung-function improvement (the mean improvement was 2.6% to 4%), the lack of better alternatives means that peak annual sales could hit $3 billion.
"
556,VRTX,"A $4.5 Billion Franchise?
"
557,VRTX,"RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee pointed out that Vertex is also testing a third drug, VX-661, and has a whole library of other correctors that could work in a wider range of genetic types. He estimates peak annual sales of $4.5 billion for the whole CF franchise.
"
558,VRTX,"""The big picture that investors should remember is this is a major improvement for sick CF patients (typically kids), and all our doc feedback is that, if the drug is FDA approved, the patients will get access to it,"" he wrote.
"
559,VRTX,"Yee raised his price target to 120 from 95, maintaining an outperform rating.
"
560,VRTX,"One question still up in the air is how the combo will price. Vertex could get away with pricing Kalydeco so high because its patient pool was so tiny and because its efficacy was so good, but analysts generally expect the combo to price much lower. Yee estimates $225,000 but writes that the Street is mostly thinking of $150,000 to $175,000.
"
561,VRTX,"Either way, Vertex will likely have the only disease-altering CF treatments on the market for quite a while, says Morningstar analyst Stefan Quenneville.

599,VRTX,"Biotech stocks sold off hard Friday as Wall Street blamed a letter by several House Democrats asking Gilead Sciences to justify the price of its hepatitis C blockbuster Sovaldi.
"

It called Sovaldi a ""breakthrough"" in HCV treatment, but expressed concern that ""a treatment will not cure patients if they cannot afford it.""
"
601,VRTX,"Due to Sovaldi's $84,000 price tag, the letter went on to say that Colorado's and Pennsylvania's Medicaid programs had already announced that they're funding Sovaldi only for the sickest patients, and California's is still figuring out its reimbursement policies.

671,VRTX,"Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated’s (VRTX  -  Free Report) shares rallied more than 15% on Jun 29, following the announcement of lower-than-expected top-line results from Galapagos NV’s (GLPG  -  Free Report) phase II study on cystic fibrosis (“CF”) candidate, GLPG2737.Galapagos is evaluating the candidate on top of Vertex’s CF drug, Orkambi (lumacaftor/ivacaftor), in the phase II PELICAN study in CF patients who are homozygous for the class II F508del mutation. The patients treated with GLPG2737, were treated with Orkambi for at least 12-weeks before the study and continued to receive it during the study. The company is developing GLPG2737 as a triple-combination regimen to treat CF patients.Data from the study showed that GLPG2737 in combination with Orkambi improved ppFEV1, a measure of lung function, by 3.4% and reduced sweat chloride by 19.6 mmol/L from baseline versus placebo.However, investors have found these data disappointing, which led to a decline in Galapagos’ share price last Friday. Vertex is also developing triple-combo regimens. Its two candidates – VX-659 and VX-445 – in combination with tezacaftor and ivacaftor have improved ppFEV1 by 13.3% and 13.8%, respectively, in early to mid-stage studies. The reduction in sweat chloride in patients was also materially higher than GLPG2737.Moreover, both the candidates are in phase III stage of development.The numbers and the stage shows that Vertex is a clear leader in the development process of triple-combo regimens for CF patients. The study results are also significantly higher, which can probably ward off competition for a longer term.So far this year, Vertex’s shares have gained 13.4% against a decrease of 7.3% registered by the industry.Galapagos is also developing triple combination regimens its own CF potentiator/correctors – GLPG2451, GLPG2222 and GLPG2737 – in a phase I study with interim data expected in the third quarter. The CF studies are being conducted in partnership with AbbVie (ABBV  -  Free Report). However, AbbVie has opted not to proceed with the development of previously contemplated second triple combination therapy comprising GLPG3067, GLPG2222 and GLPG2737.Meanwhile, Vertex announced in its press release that its third CF drug was approved for the treatment of patients aged 12 and older with two copies of the F508del mutation in the CFTR gene in Canada. The drug will available under the brand name of PrSYMDEKO.Corbus Pharmaceuticals Holdings, Inc.

672,VRTX,"We are into the second half of the year. It’s time to analyze how the first half turned out to be for pharma and biotech stocks in terms of FDA decisions. The regulatory body approved 17 novel drugs in the first half of 2018, which is less than the year-ago period figure of 23. However, with several FDA decision lined up for the second half, a higher number of drugs could be approved in the rest of the year.Key FDA approvals in the first half included Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report)/Novartis’s first CGRP antibody Aimovig/erenumab for prevention of migraine, J&J’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) next-generation oral androgen receptor (“AR”) inhibitor Erleada (apalutamide) for pre-metastatic prostate cancer (CRPC), Vertex Pharmaceuticals’ (VRTX  -  Free Report) third medicine to treat the underlying cause of CF, Symdeko, which is a combination of tezacaftor and ivacaftor and BioMarin Pharmaceuticals’ Palynziq to treat phenylketonuria (PKU).With the drug development process being lengthy and time-consuming, plus requiring the utilization of a lot of funds and resources, key pipeline events including data readouts and regulatory updates are of paramount importance and could act as major catalysts.Let’s take a look at a few important regulatory events scheduled for the month of July.FDA Decision on Indivior’s Schizophrenia Injection RBP-7000: On Jul 28, the FDA is expected to give its decision on Indivior Plc’s (INVVY  -  Free Report) RBP-7000, which has been developed for the treatment of schizophrenia. RBP-7000 is a once-monthly injectable risperidone given using the Atrigel delivery system. Indivior is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock.

The FDA is expected to give its decision on Jul 30, after a three-month delay from the previous FDA action date in March. Azedra was added to Progenics’ portfolio with the acquisition of Molecular Insight Pharmaceuticals in 2013.Decision on Insys Therapeutics’ Pain Candidate: On Jul 28, the FDA is also expected to give its decision on Insys Therapeutics’. (INSY  -  Free Report) buprenorphine sublingual spray for moderate-to-severe acute pain. It is important to remember that in May an FDA advisory committee voted against its approval. The company had filed a new drug application (""NDA"") in September last year based on positive data from a pivotal study on the candidate. The FDA accepted the NDA for review in December assigning a PDUFA date of Jul 28, 2018.It is quite possible that the unfavorable vote by the committee may influence the FDA’s decision and delay the approval of the drug.Will an FDA Panel Back New Indication for Glaxo’s Nucala?: Toward the end of the  month, an FDA panel is expected to give its opinion on Glaxo’s (GSK  -  Free Report) label expansion filing for eosinophilic asthma drug, Nucala (mepolizumab) for a  new indication -  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). With the latest filing, Glaxo is looking to get Nucala approved as an add-on maintenance treatment of COPD with an eosinophilic phenotype. Nucala is presently approved for treating severe eosinophilic asthma and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (""EGPA""). Glaxo hadfiled a supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) to the FDAfor label expansion of Nucala to include use in COPD in November last year.Although the FDA takes the recommendations of its panels/advisory committee into account while reviewing applications, it is not bound to follow the same.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

673,VRTX,"Sarepta Therapeutics Inc. (SRPT  -  Free Report) was a star performer in Tuesday’s trading session, as the stock skyrocketed as much as 57.7% to a new high of $176.50 but closed a little lower, rising 36.8% (read: 4 Sector ETFs That Crushed S&P 500 in 9-Year Bull Run).The surge propelled the company’s market cap from $6.9 billion to more than $9 billion, making it the fifth most valuable drugmaker headquartered in Massachusetts, behind Biogen (BIIB  -  Free Report), Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX  -  Free Report), Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN  -  Free Report) and Alnylam Pharmaceuticals (ALNY  -  Free Report).The massive gain for the mid-cap biotech firm came from encouraging early trial results for a gene therapy for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). The study was conducted on three patients and revealed an average reduction of more than 87% in their creatine kinase, an enzyme found within muscle cells that can leak into the bloodstream when damage has occurred in the muscle, on day 60.This indicates that Sarepta’s muscular dystrophy drug could successfully treat and produce robust levels of dystrophin, a protein that protects muscle cells.DMD is a rare genetic disease marked by progressive muscle degeneration, which can cause physical disability along with life-threatening problems in the heart and respiratory system. The disease mostly affects boys between the ages of 3 and 5, and typically kills patients before the age of 30.The positive clinical trial also sent shares of fellow DMD gene therapy developer Solid Biosciences (SLDB  -  Free Report) up by more than 46% yesterday (see: all the Healthcare ETFs here).ETF ImpactThe news led to a surge in biotech ETFs, especially Virtus LifeSci Biotech Products ETF (BBP  -  Free Report), iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF (IBB  -  Free Report) andSPDR S&P Biotech ETF (XBI  -  Free Report). The trio has risen 2.3%, 1.5% and 1.4%, respectively. In fact, BBP and XBI touched a new 52-week high each.BBP in FoucsThe ETF follows the LifeSci Biotechnology Products Index, which measures the performance of biotechnology companies with a primary product offering or product candidate that has received the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s approval. Holding 40 stocks, Sarepta Therapeutics takes the fourth position in the basket with a 4.1% share. The product has accumulated AUM of about $33.2 million and charges 79 bps in fees per year. It has a Zacks ETF Rank #2 (Buy) with a High risk outlook.IBB in FocusThis fund provides exposure to 192 firms by tracking the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index, with Sarepta accounting for 0.9% of assets. IBB is the most popular fund is the biotech space with AUM of $8.9 billion. Expense ratio comes in at 0.47%. IBB has a Zacks ETF Rank #3 (Hold) with a High risk outlook (read: Why These Small Cap Biotech ETFs are Soaring).XBI in FocusWith AUM of $5.3 billion, XBI provides equal-weight exposure across 120 stocks by tracking the S&P Biotechnology Select Industry Index. Sarepta is the seventh firm in the fund’s portfolio, making up for 1.4% share. XBI has 0.35% in expense ratio and a Zacks ETF Rank #3 with a High risk outlook.Bottom LineIn fact, these three ETFs clearly outpaced the other products in the biotech space in the last trading session. ALPS Medical Breakthroughs ETF (SBIO  -  Free Report) and Virtus LifeSci Biotech Clinical Trials ETF (BBC  -  Free Report) added just 0.5% each on the day as these products have no exposure to Sarepta Therapeutics.Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.

674,VRTX,"Investors in the biotech sector were glued last week to the highly awaited 54th annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), which overshadowed the usual regulatory and other updates from the space. The meeting, held in Chicago (Jun 1-Jun 5) provides companies with a platform to showcase their data to scientists, physicians, the investment community and others. While the focus was mainly on ASCO data, companies like Biogen (BIIB  -  Free Report) and Vertex (VRTX  -  Free Report) remained in the limelight on pipeline updates.Recap of Important Stories:Biogen/Eisai Report Encouraging Data on Elenbecestat: Biogen along with partner Eisai announced encouraging results on its Alzheimer's candidate, elenbecestat, a BACE inhibitor, from a phase II study (Study 202). The study is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel-group 18-month study among patients (n=70) with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to Alzheimer’s disease, or mild-to-moderate dementia due to Alzheimer’s disease with confirmed amyloid pathology by PET ((positron emission tomography) screening. All the patients were randomized to four treatment arms receiving elenbecestat (5, 15, or 50 mg) or placebo daily. More than half the patients in the elenbecestat 5 mg and 15 mg arms were switched to the 50 mg arm for three months or more. The data showed elenbecestat was generally safe and well tolerated. Results demonstrated a statistically significant difference in amyloid beta(Aβ) levels in the brain measured by amyloid-PET and suggested a delay of clinical symptom decline in exploratory endpoints. Eisai and Biogen are jointly developing elenbecestat since March 2014. Both companies are currently conducting two global phase III studies (MISSION AD1/2) on early Alzheimer’s disease.Biogen currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Vertex/ CRISPR Sickle Cell Disease Candidate Put On Hold: Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated and CRISPR Therapeutics announced that the FDA has placed a clinical hold on the Investigational New Drug Application (IND) for CTX001 for the treatment of sickle cell disease pending the resolution of certain questions raised by the FDA. Both the companies had submitted the IND to the FDA in April to support the planned initiation of a phase I/II trial in the United States in adult patients with sickle cell disease. CTX001 is an experimental, gene-edited autologous hematopoietic stem cell therapy which is also being evaluated for patients suffering from β-thalassemia along with sickle cell disease.  Despite the FDA clinical hold, both the companies plan to initiate a phase I/II trial on CTX001 in Europe in adult patients with transfusion dependent β-thalassemia. CRISPR and Vertex will equally share all research and development costs and profits worldwide for CTX001. (Read more: Vertex/CRISPR's Sickle Disease Candidate Put on Hold by FDA)Sarepta Gets Negative CHMP Opinion For Exondys: Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc. (SRPT  -  Free Report) announced that the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA), has adopted a negative opinion for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) candidate, Exondys (eteplirsen). A negative opinion was expected following the oral explanation trend vote. Consequently, Sarepta will request a re-examination of the opinion, which will result in the assignment of a new rapporteur and co-rapporteur. Additionally, Sarepta will request a Scientific Advisory Group (SAG) on DMD be called. This in turn will allow neuromuscular specialists to provide expert guidance and insight into, among other things, the validity of the external controls used and the importance of certain functional endpoints. The re-examination will be completed by the end of 2018.And finally a look at some ASCO results: Celgene (CELG  -  Free Report) had multiple presentations on its oncology drugs Revlimid, Pomalyst along with other experimental therapies at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting in Chicago, IL. Results from the TRANSCEND study on experimental CD19-directed CAR T cell therapy candidate, lisocabtagene maraleucel (liso-cel; JCAR017), in patients with relapsed/refractory (r/r) aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) were encouraging. (Read more: Celgene Presents Data on CAR T Therapy, Revlimid&Pomalyst).Regeneron (REGN  -  Free Report) and partner Sanofi also announced data from two trials evaluating cemiplimab in advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma at the ASCO. The data from the study showed that patients treated with cemiplimab experienced robust anti-tumor effects. Cemiplimab-treated patients showed a 47.5% response rate with a median observed time to response of two months as of the data cut-off date.Gilead’s (GILD  -  Free Report) Kite also announced results from an ongoing phase I study at the ASCO which showed that clinical responses were observed with investigational T cell receptor (TCR) cell therapy targeting human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV-16) E7 in solid tumor cancers caused by HPV. Meanwhile, Gilead has also collaborated with Hookipa Biotech AG and obtained exclusive rights to Hookipa's TheraT and Vaxwave arenavirus vector-based immunization technologies for two major chronic infectious disease indications, hepatitis B virus (HBV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Gilead and partner Galapagos NV also announced that the phase II study, EQUATOR, on pipeline candidate, filgotinib, achieved its primary endpoint of improvement in the signs and symptoms of psoriatic arthritis at Week 16.Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report) also announced results from the phase III trial, A.R.R.O.W. at the ASCO which showed that Kyprolis administered once-weekly at 70 mg/m2 with dexamethasone achieved superior progression-free survival (PFS) and overall response rates (ORR) compared to twice-weekly Kyprolisat 27 mg/m2 and dexamethasone (twice-weekly Kd) in patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma. Separately, shares of Amgen were down as the FDA approved a biosimilar of its blockbuster drug Neulasta.PerformanceMedical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % Return  Medical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % ReturnThe NASDAQ Biotechnology Index gained 0.60% over the last five trading sessions.

675,VRTX,"Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (VRTX  -  Free Report) and partner CRISPR Therapeutics AG (CRSP  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA has placed a clinical hold on the companies’ investigational new drug (IND) application for CTX001. The companies had filed the IND application last month to start a phase I/II study on CTX00 in sickle cell disease in the United States.As part of the review of the IND, the FDA will put forward certain questions to the companies. Vertex and CRISPR Therapeutics plan to work rapidly with the FDA to resolve the issue so that the clinical hold is lifted and the study initiated.In December, as part of a strategic research collaboration formed in 2015, Vertex and CRISPR Therapeutics selected CTX001 to move into clinical development as a gene edited treatment for sickle cell disease and β-thalassemia developed using CRISPR Therapeutics’ proprietary CRISPR/Cas9 technology. Back then, the companies had opted toco-develop and co-commercialize CTX001 and equally share all R&D costs and profits worldwide. Vertex has rights to license up to six new gene editing treatments (including CTX001) developed using the CRISPR/Cas9 technology that emerge from the joint research deal.An application has also been submitted to begin a phase I/II study in β-thalassemia in 2018 in Europe. The plan to begin this study — in the second half of this year — is intact and unaffected by the hold on the sickle cell disease study.Shares of CRISPR Therapeutics were down more than 14% in after-hours trading on Wednesday in response to the negative pipeline update while Vertex’s stock did not show any movement. In fact, so far this year CRISPR Therapeutics’ shares have gained 213.4% while that of Vertex are up 4.5% compared to the industry’s decline of 9.9%.Genomic editing technology using CRISPR technology to repair defective genetic material that causes diseases is probably one of the most promising and exciting healthcare innovations in decades. Though there are several methods to use CRISPR to target genetic defects that cause specific diseases, the most promising is the use of an enzyme called Cas9 to deliver CRISPR to affected cells.Other than CRISPR Therapeutics, Intellia Therapeutics (NTLA  -  Free Report) and Editas Medicine, Inc (EDIT  -  Free Report) also plan to carry out clinical studies using CRISPR Cas9 to address diseases.Shares of both Intellia Therapeutics and Editas Medicine were down more than 3% in after-hours on Wednesday.While CRISPR Therapeutics currently has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Vertex has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

676,VRTX,"We recently documented the potential of Genome Editing technology to revolutionize the treatment of many serious diseases and three companies who are positioned to use a specific method of gene therapy called CIRSPR Cas9 to repair genetic diseases - CRISPR Therapeutics (CRSP  -  Free Report), Intellia Therapeutics (NTLA  -  Free Report) and Editas Medicine (EDIT  -  Free Report).Read the article here>>After a spectacular runup in 2018, shares of CRISPR hit a snag recently.Late Wednesday, CRSP announced that the U.S. FDA had placed a clinical hold on the company’s investigational new drug (IND) application to use the technology in a phase I/II study on sickle cell disease patients in the U.S. beginning later in 2018.The markets pummeled CRSP’s shares which traded down almost 20% in after hours trading on Wednesday night and though they have recovered somewhat, remain 10% lower than Wednesday’s close in intraday trading.To determine whether the recent selloff represents a buying opportunity for investors to get in on this recently red-hot stock at a more attractive price, let’s take a quick look at the FDA’s IND process and what a “Clinical Hold” actually means.The FDA ProcessBefore researchers can conduct human clinical trials into an investigational drug, it must submit an application to the FDA addressing key safety and efficacy issues.  The application is required to contain information in three broad areas: Animal Pharmacology and Toxicology Studies, Manufacturing Information and Clinical Protocols and Investigator Information. The applicant can not initiate clinical trials for 30 days while the FDA reviews the IND for safety and to ensure that research subjects will not be subject to unreasonable risk.It was during this review period that CRSP received notice from the FDA of the clinical hold, meaning they could not proceed with trials until the FDA had performed further review.The grounds for a clinical hold at this stage encompass a wide range of possibilities.The most serious include the possibilities that the application is intentionally erroneous or misleading, the investigators are not qualified to perform the trials, or that there is a significant risk of illness or injury to the participants.The least serious is that the IND application simply does not contain sufficient information needed to assess the risks to subjects of the proposed study.Any one or more of the listed grounds is sufficient for the imposition of a clinical hold. Within 30 days of imposing the clinical hold, the FDA must send the applicant a letter describing in detail the reasons for the hold. The applicant is expected to respond to any and all issues detailed in the hold letter (without a specific time limit, although presumably they have an impetus to respond as expediently as possible), then the FDA has 30 more days to address the response and choose to extend or lift the clinical hold.The FDA does not make the details of these proceeding public during these periods.CRISPR’s ApplicationIn its statement Wednesday, CIRSPR therapeutics and its joint venture partner Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX  -  Free Report) said only “CRISPR and Vertex expect to obtain additional information on the FDA’s questions in the near future and plan to work rapidly with the FDA toward a solution.”So at this point, investors are somewhat in the dark about the reason(s) for the clinical hold and what they mean for the future of the trials and the company.It’s possible that the application is simply not thorough enough and CRISPR can append the relevant information and continue as planned with little delay.It’s possible that the FDA is simply proceeding with extreme caution (and subjecting this particular application to additional scrutiny) because gene therapy is so new that they want to be aware of all potential risks before they let the proverbial genie out of the bottle.  Or it’s possible that the FDA sees serious risks in the trials or factual inconsistencies in the application that threaten to doom the project altogether.Based on the language of CRISPR’s press release, the odds are that it’s one of the first two reasons, but without more information, it’s impossible to know. At this point, investors should probably avoid adding to a position until the reasons for the hold are clearer.We will continue to monitor the situation. More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!

677,VRTX,"2017 turned out to be a notable year for the pharma and biotech industry with the FDA giving its nod to 46 novel drugs as well as several biological license applications (“BLA”) including for path-breaking cancer treatments like Kymriah and Yescarta. This number compares favorably not only to 2016 when just 22 novel drugs were approved, but to earlier years as well.Other key approvals last year include Lilly’s Verzenio (advanced or metastatic breast cancer), Gilead’s Vosevi (hepatitis C virus), Puma’s Nerlynx (to reduce the risk of breast cancer returning), J&J’s Tremfya (moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis), Regeneron/Sanofi’s Kevzara (rheumatoid arthritis), Roche’s multiple sclerosis treatment, Ocrevus, Regeneron (REGN  -  Free Report) and Sanofi’s eczema treatment, Dupixent, Tesaro’s PARP inhibitor, Zejula, and BioMarin’s (BMRN  -  Free Report) Brineura (treatment of a specific form of Batten disease) among others. Many of these drugs have blockbuster potential.With the drug development process being lengthy and time-consuming and requiring the utilization of a lot of funds and resources, key pipeline events including data readouts and regulatory updates are of paramount importance and could act as major catalysts. Here is a look at a few important regulatory events scheduled for the month of February.FDA Decision for AMAG’s Makena and Feraheme: AMAG Pharmaceuticals (AMAG  -  Free Report) is seeking FDA approval for a subcutaneous auto-injector version of Makena - the drug-device combination product, if approved on the PDUFA date of February 14, would offer the convenience of using a ready-to-administer subcutaneous auto-injector while providing patients with an alternative option to an intramuscular injection. Makena is currently available as an intramuscular injection for reducing the risk of preterm birth in women who are pregnant with one baby and who spontaneously delivered one preterm baby in the past.  The approval of this product would help AMAG extend the patent life of Makena which is scheduled to lose orphan drug exclusivity on February 3. While AMAG is ready to launch an authorized generic along with a partner in February itself, the company does not expect a generic competitor to enter the market until later in 2018. If the drug-device combination product is approved, the company will apply for Orange Book listing of the patents for the device.Meanwhile, the FDA is expected to issue a decision regarding the label expansion of Feraheme on February 2. AMAG is looking to expand the label beyond the current chronic kidney disease (“CKD”) indication to include all eligible adult patients with iron deficiency anemia (“IDA”).Priority Review for Gilead’s HIV Treatment: Gilead Sciences (GILD  -  Free Report) is also awaiting a decision from the FDA this month for its new drug application (“NDA”) for an investigational, fixed-dose combination of bictegravir (50 mg) (“BIC”), an integrase strand transfer inhibitor, and emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (200/25 mg) (FTC/TAF), a dual-NRTI backbone, for the treatment of HIV-1 infection. The NDA is under priority review with a decision expected on February 12. With the company’s hepatitis C virus (“HCV”) franchise seeing declining sales, Gilead is focusing on its HIV franchise for growth. The company’s HIV portfolio includes drugs like Genvoya, Truvada, Atripla, Descovy, Odefsey, Complera and Stribild which contributed approximately $9.5 billion to total sales in the first nine months of 2017. Gilead’s TAF-based products like Genvoya, Descovy and Odefsey remain key growth drivers.Will Vertex Boost its CF Portfolio with an FDA Approval This Month? Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX  -  Free Report) is a key player in the cystic fibrosis (“CF”) market with two products, Orkambi and Kalydeco, in its CF portfolio. The company is looking to strengthen its position in this area further with the potential approval of a tezacaftor/ivacaftor combination treatment that is under priority review with a decision from the FDA expected on February 28. The combination treatment is under review for use in CF patients (12 years and older) who have two copies of the F508del mutation or one F508del mutation and one residual function mutation that is responsive to the treatment.The approval of this combination would be a major boost for Vertex’s CF portfolio which is expected to deliver revenues in the range of $2.1 - $2.15 billion in 2017. Currently, about 31,000 patients are eligible for treatment under the company’s CF portfolio with the number expected to grow to 44,000 in 2018 on the back of EU reimbursement for Orkambi, label expansion for the drug and the potential approval of the tezacaftor/ivacaftor combination.Vertex’s shares are up 94% over the last one year, outperforming the 10% rally of the industry it belongs to. Vertex is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock - you can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc. (VRX  -  Free Report) also expects to hear from the FDA about the approval status of Plenvu, a bowel cleanser used in preparation for colonoscopies (FDA action date: February 13). Moreover, companies like KemPharm and Apricus expect a response from the FDA this month for their resubmitted NDAs. While KemPharm has a PDUFA date of February 23 for Apadaz (an immediate-release, abuse-deterrent hydrocodone/acetaminophen combination product candidate), Apricus will get to know the approval status of its resubmitted Vitaros (topically delivered treatment for erectile dysfunction) NDA on February 17.Meanwhile, the FDA’s Anesthetic and Analgesic Drug Products Advisory Committee will be meeting on February 14 to discuss Pacira Pharmaceuticals’s (PCRX  -  Free Report) supplemental new drug application (sNDA) for Exparel (bupivacaine liposomal injectable suspension), to produce local analgesia and as a nerve block to produce regional analgesia.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

678,VRTX,"The fourth-quarter 2017 earnings season is in full swing with financial figures from 133 S&P 500 members or 26% of the index already out as of Jan 26, 2018 per the latest Earnings Preview.Total earnings for these index members jumped 12.3% from the year-ago quarter, driven by 8.8% improvement in revenues. The beat ratio was 81.2% for the bottom line and 78.9% for the top line.On a positive note, the ongoing earnings phase seems to have begun well for the Drug/Biotech sector. Among major large cap players, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) kicked off the season with earnings beating estimates while sales slightly missing the same. A few other large pharma companies released their earnings results last week and the picture looks quite encouraging.The pharma bigwigs having reported last week are Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report) and AbbVie (ABBV  -  Free Report), which surpassed both earnings and sales estimates in the quarter under review. While Novartis raised its sales guidance for 2018, AbbVie increased its previously issued earnings expectations for the year.Of the major players in the biotech sector, Biogen (BIIB  -  Free Report) announced a mixed performance in the reported period with earnings lagging estimates while sales exceeding the same. However, Celgene Corp. (CELG  -  Free Report) outpaced both the metrics’ expectations during the fourth quarter.Drug/biotech stocks remained on a growth trajectory in 2017, courtesy of a slew of FDA approvals, rise in demand for new product sales, successful innovation and product line expansion, strong clinical reports as well as a continued robust performance of legacy products. Moreover, these impressive factors, along with regular acquisitions, are expected to drive the sector’s growth in 2018 as well.Also, per the Earnings Preview, the broader Medical sector (inclusive of drug, biotech as well as Medical Device companies) is likely to record 4.9% year-over-year growth in revenues and a 4.2% rise in earnings in the period under discussion.Two pharma/biotech giants are scheduled to report earnings numbers on Jan 31. Let's see how things are shaping up for the companies in the upcoming releases.Eli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report)Lilly is scheduled to release fourth-quarter earnings before the market opens. The company delivered a positive surprise of 1.94% last quarter. Lilly’s earnings performance has been modest with earnings missing expectations in three of the last four quarters while beating the same in the remaining one, thus bringing the average beat to 1.68%.Our proven model shows that Lilly is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. The combination of Lilly’s Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP as a solid Zacks Rank, and a positive Earnings ESP of +0.47% makes us confident about an earnings beat in the impending report. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter to be reported is pegged at $1.08 per share.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.We expect a sturdy uptake of new products like Trulicity, Taltz, Basaglar, Cyramza, Jardiance and Lartruvo. This upside is likely to make up for the decline in sales of established products like Zyprexa, Alimta, Cialis, Strattera and Effient in the fourth quarter.

679,VRTX,"Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (VRTX  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report its fourth-quarter 2017 results on Jan 31, after the market closes.Vertex’s shares have soared 100.5% in the past year while the industry has recorded an increase of 11.8%.Vertex’s track record has been impressive so far. The company delivered positive earnings surprises in each of the last four quarters. The average positive earnings surprise for the last four quarters is 32.67%. In the last reported quarter, Vertex came up with a positive surprise of 43.24%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this quarter.Factors at PlayVertex’s cystic fibrosis (""CF"") drugs — Kalydeco & Orkambi — performed consistently in the first three quarters of 2017. We expect this positive trend to be reflected in the results of the soon-to-be reported quarter.Approval of two line extensions for Kalydeco in the United States has increased the eligible patient population for the drug. In May 2017, Kalydeco was approved for use in patients 2 and older who have one of 23 residual function mutations in the CFTR gene. This was followed by approval in people who have mutations responsive to Kalydeco, including one of five ""splice"" mutations, in August 2017. The expansion of patient population will certainly boost sales of the drug. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Kalydeco for the fourth quarter is $224 million. For 2017, Vertex expects Kalydeco revenues to be in the range of $810-$830 million.In December 2017, Vertex announced that Kalydeco met endpoints in a phase III study in patients aged one to two years who have one of 10 mutations in the CFTR gene. Regulatory applications for label expansion are planned to be filed in the first quarter of 2018. We also note that regulatory applications for another label expansion of Kalydeco are under review. The applications seek approval of Kalydeco+tezacaftor in patients aged 12 and older who have two copies of the F508del mutation or one F508del mutation and one residual function mutation. We expect Vertex to provide updateson the earnings call.Although, the company has not been so successful with agreements in Europe related to Orkambi, the drug has done well so far this year. In June and July, Vertex struck re-imbursement agreements in Ireland and Italy, respectively. The consensus estimate for Orkambi for the fourth quarter is $361 million.In January 2018, Vertex announced that an extension of the marketing application for Orkambi was approved in Europe. With the approval, Orkambi’s marketing label in EU will now include use in children with CF aged between six and 11 years and have two copies of the F508del mutation, expanding patient population by about 3,400.Investor focus on the call will be on these triple combination CF regimens, which are crucial for long-term growth of Vertex.However, operating expenses are likely to be on the higher side with Vertex expanding its pipeline and conducting multiple studies to evaluate candidates.What Our Model IndicatesOur proven model does not conclusively show that Vertex is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate (earnings of 55 cents) and the Zacks Consensus Estimate (earnings of 58 cents), stands at -4%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Vertex’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise.Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated Price and Consensus  Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated Price and Consensus | Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated QuoteStocks That Warrant a LookHere are some biotech stocks that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

680,VRTX,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (VRTX  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 1.2% in that time frame.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is VRTX due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Vertex Q1 Earnings Beat on Strong CF Products SalesVertex reported first-quarter 2018 earnings per share of 76 cents, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 58 cents and came ahead of the year-ago earnings of 41 cents. Strong product revenues led to higher profits in the quarter.Vertex reported revenues of $640.8 million in the first quarter, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $617.6 million. However, sales were down 10.3% year over year due to significantly lower collaborative revenues.The company had received an upfront payment of $230 million from Merck KGaA in the year-ago period for out-licensing four oncology programs, which was missing in the first quarter of 2018.CF Franchise Sales StrongVertex’s first-quarter revenues consisted of sales from cystic fibrosis (“CF”) products, Kalydeco and Orkambi, collaborative ($1.7 million) and royalty revenues ($1.4 million). CF product revenues were $637.7 million in the first quarter, up 33% year over year. Continued label expansion of Kalydeco and Orkambi and launch of Symdeko pulled up CF sales in the quarter.Kalydeco sales surged 34.4% to $250 million, following approvals to treat an expanded population.Orkambi (lumacaftor/ivacaftor) delivered sales of $354 million, up 20% year over year due to higher sales in the United States as well as international markets.Symdeko contributed $34 million to the top line in the quarter which reflects the initial seven weeks of sales. On the call, the company said that Symdeko launch is off to a strong start in the United States while approval in the EU is expected in the second half. Costs RiseAdjusted research and development (R&D) expenses increased 14.7% to $260 million in the first quarter due to higher costs related to phase III development of triple combination CF regimens. Adjusted selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased 15.4% to $99.6 million mainly driven by worldwide investments to support its drugs, Kalydeco and Orkambi and costs incurred to prepare for the launch of Symdeko.2018 GuidanceVertex provided guidance for 2018 CF revenues in the range of $2.65 to $2.8 billion. The midpoint of this range represents approximately 26% growth over 2017.Combined adjusted research and development (R&D) and selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense guidance for 2018 was maintained in the range of $1.50 to $1.55 billion.The increase in operating expense reflects anticipated costs related to pivotal studies for the two triple combinations regimens and investment to support the launch of Symdeko.The company is optimistic that operating margins and earnings will expand in 2018 as increase in revenues will exceed increase in costs.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?It turns out, fresh estimates have trended upward during the past month. There have been seven revisions higher for the current quarter compared to two lower.Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated Price and Consensus  Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated Price and Consensus | Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated QuoteVGM ScoresAt this time, VRTX has a strong Growth Score of A, though it is lagging a lot on the momentum front with a C. The stock was allocated a grade of D on the value side, putting it in the bottom 40% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of B. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Our style scores indicate that the stock is more suitable for growth investors than momentum investors.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending upward for the stock and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising. Notably, VRTX has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.

681,VRTX,"One of the most promising and exciting healthcare innovations in decades is genomic editing technology using CRISPR technology to repair defective genetic material that causes disease.  CRISPR is an acronym for “Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats.”  CRISPR research is an offshoot of the Human Genome Project which mapped all the genes in the human body in 2003. Armed with the knowledge of how genetic material is supposed to be structured, researchers then endeavored to devise ways to “fix” it when it is incorrect.A breakthrough came from the field of bacteria research. Certain bacteria have developed an immune response in which they retain a piece of DNA of an invading virus as a reminder, and then if that DNA is encountered again, the bacteria use CRISPR to alter it, rendering the virus innocuous.Thousands of scientists are currently researching ways to use this same mechanism to alter human DNA but “cutting out” defective portions of the sequence and replacing them with the correct code.  As many as 6,000 diseases are caused by genetic factors, including Alzheimer’s, hemophilia, sickle cell disease, ALS and many cancers.  The ability to identify and fix faulty genes could make many of these diseases effectively curable.Research has delivered several methods to use CRISPR to target the genetic defects that cause specific diseases, but the most promising at this point uses an enzyme called Cas9 to deliver CRISPR to affected cells.  Three companies currently have plans to do studies this year on human subjects using CRISPR Cas9 to address disease.CRISPR Therapeutics (CRSP  -  Free Report) has been one of the best performing stocks in the U.S. in 2018, up nearly 200% YTD. Though already on the radar of traders and analysts, the stock got additional boosts from a 60 Minutes piece on the technology in April and favorable response to the company’s presentation at a Merrill Lynch Healthcare Conference last week.CRSP is about to begin trials of CRISPR Cas9 in the treatment of two related genetic blood disorders in humans, B-thalassemia and Sickle Cells Disease.  The  approach, internally named CTX001, has had a Clinical Trial Application (CTA) granted for B-thalassemia study in Europe and has an Investigational New Drug (IND) application pending for study on Sickle Cell Disease in the U.S.Though CRSP’s potential therapies are still in the developmental stages and the company has yet to turn a profit, promising results in animal trials and joint ventures with Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX  -  Free Report) and Casebia Therapeutics have analysts turning more bullish on the potential of these technologies to one day turn into potential blockbuster drugs.  CRSP is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Also focused on genetic therapies using the CRISPR Cas9 system, Intellia Therapeutics (NTLA  -  Free Report) recently announced that its first cell-therapy target will be acute myeloid leukemia and other potential hematological malignancies as well as solid tumors.Intellia has a diversified strategy toward selecting disease targets using various types of genetic edits and using both in vivo and ex vivo delivery, insulating the company from the possibility of disappointing results in specific categories.Intellia has partnered with Regeneron (REGN  -  Free Report) for in vivo delivery, specifically for liver disease and Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report) for ex vivo delivery to treat various cancers.Three analyst upward revisions in the past 30 days for both quarterly and 2018 earnings suggest increasing optimism about the future of NTLA’s CRISPR therapies and the shares are up 34% in 2018, versus a return of -10% for the genetic therapies industry as a whole.  NTLA is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Cambridge, MA based Editas Medicine, Inc (EDIT  -  Free Report) is a discovery phase company applying CRISPR Csa9 genetic therapies to the treatment of Leber Congenital Amaurosis – a degenerative and debilitating eye disease.  Results from non-human primate trials were encouraging, with test subject tolerating the injected treatment and with immunity to bacterial infections not impacting the pharmacological activities of the drug.  (Immuno-response destroying the active properties of the drugs is sometimes a concern with CRISPR Cas9 therapies.)Editas also has drugs in the pipeline to treat cancer, muscular dystrophy and cystic fibrosis.The company is bolstered by a strong balance sheet with $329 million in cash and equivalents and has thus far retained commercial rights to all but one of it’s pipeline programs. EDIT is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Obviously, investing in development-stage companies carries significant risk and should only be a small part of a diversified strategy, but for real home-run potential, Genetic Editing is an extremely promising sector.Wall Street’s Next Amazon Zacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time. It’s a once-in-a-generation opportunity to invest in pure genius.  Click for details >>

682,VRTX,"The Biotech space remained a key area of investors focus as several bigwigs announced quarterly results. While Alexion (ALXN  -  Free Report) reported solid results, Gilead (GILD  -  Free Report) reported dismal numbers. Among other developments over the week, Regeneron (REGN  -  Free Report) and Sanofi announced plans to lower the price of Praluent, while Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report) received a positive opinion for Prolia.Recap of Important Stories:Q1 Progress Report: Companies like Alexion, Gilead and Vertex (VRTX  -  Free Report), among others reported first-quarter results over the last five trading sessions. While Alexion and Vertex delivered solid results for the quarter, Gilead’s both earnings and sales missed estimates on wider-than-expected decline in HCV franchise.Following the Q1 results, Alexion raised guidance and also reported positive data on its long-acting C5 complement inhibitor — ALXN1210 which showed that patients with PNH can be effectively and safely switched from treatment with Soliris every two weeks to treatment with ALXN1210 every eight weeks.A tentative approval will bode well for Alexion (read more: Alexion's Earnings Beat Estimates in Q1, Guidance Up).Vertex’s first-quarter results were driven by the stellar performance of CF products (read more: Vertex Q1 Earnings Beat on Strong CF Products Sales).Gilead is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock.

Meanwhile, the company’s supplemental Biologics License Application for Prolia for this expanded indication is also under review in the United States with a Prescription Drug User Fee Act action date of May 28, 2018.We note that the drug is already approved in the United States for the treatment of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at high risk for fracture.In addition, the CHMP has adopted a positive opinion recommending a label variation for Kyprolis (carfilzomib) to include the final overall survival data from the phase III trial, ASPIRE which demonstrated that the addition of Kyprolis to lenalidomide and dexamethasone (KRd) reduced the risk of death by 21% versus lenalidomide and dexamethasone alone (Rd) and extended OS by 7.9 months in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.Regeneron and partner Sanofi to Cut Praluent Price: Regeneron and partner Sanofi announced that both companies will lower the net price of PCSK9 inhibitor Praluent (alirocumab) injection for more affordable patient access from Express Scripts.Consequently, Praluent will become the exclusive PCSK9 inhibitor therapy on the Express Scripts national formulary.  The agreement (effective Jul 1) provides Praluent at lower net price and enables streamlined patient access based on physician attestation.  Meanwhile, the FDA has accepted for priority review the companies’ Biologics License Application for cemiplimab for the treatment of patients with metastatic cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (“CSCC”) or patients with locally advanced CSCC who are not candidates for surgery. The candidate was granted Breakthrough Therapy designation status by the FDA in September 2017. The target action date is Oct 28, 2018.Biogen Negotiates Agreement With Neurimmune: Biogen (BIIB  -  Free Report) and Neurimmune announced that the former has exercised its option to further reduce the previously negotiated royalty rates payable on potential future sales of its Alzheimer’s disease candidate, aducanumab.The candidate is currently in phase III. As a result, Biogen will make a one-time $50 million payment to Neurimmune in exchange for a 5% reduction in the original royalty rates on potential commercial sales of aducanumab. Both companies had earlier announced a 15% reduction in royalty rates. The reduced royalty rates on potential commercial sales of aducanumab will be in the high single digits to low-teens. Biogen licensed the worldwide rights to aducanumab from Neurimmune in 2007.PerformanceMedical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % Return  Medical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % Return The NASDAQ Biotechnology Index gained 0.83% over the last five trading sessions.

683,VRTX,"In 2018, the biotech industry is expected to witness a continuation of last year’s favorable trends. Last year, the industry benefited from a number of FDA approvals, new product sales ramp up, R&D success and innovation, strong clinical study results and continued strength in some legacy products. There were some first-time approvals for innovative/game-changing treatment options.Noteworthy among them was the approval of Novartis’ (NVS  -  Free Report) Kymriah, the first cell-based gene therapy known as CAR-T therapy, which is an innovative treatment option for cancer. This was followed by another CAR-T approval, that of Kite Pharma’s Yescarta. Spark Therapeutics’s Luxturna, the first gene therapy to treat a rare, inherited form of childhood blindness, was also approved last year.The NASDAQ Biotechnology Index gained 17.8% in 2017. Moreover, the Medical - Biomed/Genetics industry increased 2.8% in the same time frame.Though pricing pressure, rising competition, pipeline setbacks, slowdown in growth of mature products and generic competition for certain key drugs are some of the headwinds, the above-mentioned factors should continue contributing to the sector’s growth in 2018.In December, the tax overhaul was signed into law, slashing corporate tax rates from 35% to 21% which can boost profits of large drug/biotech companies. Meanwhile, the change in tax code will also allow companies to bring back huge cash held overseas at a one-time tax rate of 10%.Also, the tax cuts are expected to prevent inversions, which were rampant in the drug industry. These changes should definitely leave more cash in the hands of drug/biotech companies. The cash can be invested for mergers/acquisitions, which have been few in 2017.With this bullish outlook for the sector, we look at three biotech stocks that have seen their share price rise more than 5% this year so far and look well positioned for the rest of 2018. All the three stocks have witnessed upward estimate revisions and have a favorable Zacks Rank - Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy).Alkermes plc (ALKS  -  Free Report): Alkermes is focused on the development and marketing of treatments for central nervous system (""CNS"") diseases. Year 2018 is expected to be a transformative year for Alkermes’ development pipeline.Key events lined up for the year include FDA’s review of ALKS 546’s  new drug application (NDA) for the treatment of major depressive disorder, the phase III data readout for ALKS 3831 in schizophrenia, the NDA filing for ALKS 8700 in the first half of 2018, which is being evaluated for the treatment of multiple sclerosis. The company could also gain FDA approval for new initiation product of Aristada (Aripiprazole Lauroxil NanoCrystal Dispersion ) for the treatment of schizophrenia  by Jun 30. Alkermes, a Zacks Rank #2 stock, has seen its shares gain 7.3% year to date compared with the 2.4% rally of the industry it belongs to. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. The company has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 earnings being revised 50% upward over the last 30 days.Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc. (VRTX  -  Free Report): Vertexsports a Zacks Rank #1. Its earnings per share estimates for 2018 have moved up 2.8% in the last 30 days. The company delivered a positive earnings surprise in each of the last four quarters, with an average beat of 32.67%. Share price of the company has increased 5.4% year to date.Year 2017 was a tremendous year for Vertex with positive data read-outs and regulatory approvals leading to an increase in eligible patient population for its two cystic fibrosis (CF) products - Kalydeco & Orkambi. The trend continues in 2018 with Orkambi getting EU approval for pediatric use.With a consistent expansion in patient population, Vertex’s CF product revenues increased through 2017. The company is optimistic that the positive trend in CF sales will continue in 2018 on additional reimbursement approvals for Orkambi in ex-U.S. markets and approval to launch tezacaftor (VX-661)/ivacaftor combination medicine.Vertex’s CF pipeline is also quite strong with a broad portfolio of next-generation CF correctors. Vertex also made decent clinical progress across multiple CF studies in 2017 and has meaningful pipeline catalysts. Investor focus is on triple combination CF regimens, which are crucial for long-term growth as these have the potential to treat up to 90% of CF patients. Vertex plans to initiatepivotal phase III studies on up to two of the four triple combination regimens in the first half of 2018.Agenus Inc. (AGEN  -  Free Report): Agenuscarries a Zacks Rank #2. Loss estimates for the company narrowed by 0.7% for 2018 in the last 30 days. Share price of the company has increased 18.7% year to date. Agenus has formed collaborations with Merck (MRK  -  Free Report) and Incyte to discover and develop multiple checkpoint antibodies.In October 2017, the FDA granted marketing authorization to GlaxoSmithKline's (GSK  -  Free Report) herpes zoster vaccine, Shingrix, which contains Agenus' proprietary immune adjuvant QS-21 Stimulon. This is good news for Agenus as Shingrix has a blockbuster potential and an increase in its sales will impact the business of Agenus positively   Earlier this month, the company announced a $230 million non-dilutive royalty financing transaction with HealthCare Royalty Partners (HCR) which will significantly boost its cash position. Agenus will use part of these proceeds to redeem its royalty bond from Oberland and to fund its pivotal pipeline programs. The company also announced new leadership appointments to enhance its team and advance ongoing pivotal programs with CTLA-4 and PD-1 which will support its planned BLA filings in the second half of 2019 and in 2020.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest Strategies It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

684,VRTX,"Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (VRTX  -  Free Report) reported first-quarter 2018 earnings per share of 76 cents, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 58 cents and came ahead of the year-ago earnings of 41 cents. Strong product revenues led to higher profits in the quarter.Vertex reported revenues of $640.8 million in the first quarter, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $617.56 million. However, sales were down 10.3% year over year due to significantly lower collaborative revenues.The company had received an upfront payment of $230 million from Germany-based Merck KGaA in the year-ago period for out-licensing of four oncology programs.CF Drugs Sales Remain StrongVertex’s first-quarter revenues consisted of sales from cystic fibrosis (“CF”) products — Kalydeco, Orkambi and Symdeko, collaborative ($1.7 million) and royalty revenues ($1.4 million). CF product revenues were $637.7 million in the first quarter, up 33% year over year due to continuous expansion of patient population.Kalydeco sales surged 34.4% to $250 million while Orkambi (lumacaftor/ivacaftor) delivered sales of $354 million, up 20% year over year.The growth was supported by continued approvals in expanded population and uptake globally.During the quarter, Vertex received approval for its third CF drug, Symdeko, in the United States. The drug has contributed $34 million to the top line.Costs RiseAdjusted research and development (R&D) expenses increased 14.7% to $260 million in the first quarter due to higher costs related to phase III development of triple combination CF regimens. Adjusted selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased 15.4% to $99.6 million mainly driven by worldwide investments to support the treatment of CF patients.2018 Revenue GuidanceVertex provided guidance for 2018 revenues, primarily driven by CF drugs sales. The company expects revenues to be in the range of $2.65 to $2.8 billion.Guidance for combined adjusted research and development (R&D) and selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses in 2018 was maintained in the range of $1.50 to $1.55 billion.Pipeline & Regulatory UpdatesVertex remained focused on developing its triple combination regimens for treatment of CF. The company has advanced two next-generation CFTR correctors – VX-659 and VX-445 – to phase III stage.In February 2018, the FDA approved Symdeko for the treatment of CF patients aged 12 and older who have two copies of the F508del mutation or who have at least one mutation that is responsive to Symdeko. The drug is under review in the EU for a similar indication.An ongoing phase III study is evaluating Symdeko in children aged 6 through 11 years with similar mutations.A label expansion of Kalydeco to include patients aged 2 to 12 years is under review in the United States as well as Europe. A decision from the FDA is expected in August. Meanwhile, Vertex is also evaluating the drug in a phase II study for the treatment of infants below 12 months.Similarly, Vertex is also seeking approval of Orkambi in patients aged two to five years. Regulatory applications are under review in the United States and Europe with a decision expected in August in the United States. A phase III study will be initiated in the second half of 2018 to evaluate the drug in patients aged between 12 months and less than 24 months.Moreover, in January 2018, the European Commission approved a line extension for Orkambi to include use in children with CF aged between six and 11 years and who have two copies of the F508del mutation.Apart from CF, Vertex is also developing treatments for sickle cell disease, thalassemia, influenza and pain management. During the first quarter, Vertex announced positive data from a Phase II proof-of-concept study evaluating its pain candidate, VX-150, for acute pain following bunionectomy surgery. Two other phase II studies are evaluating the candidate in neuropathic pain and pain from osteoarthritis of the knee.

686,VRTX,"We expect Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (VRTX  -  Free Report) to beat expectations when it reports first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 26, after market close.Vertex’s shares have increased 5.9% so far this year while the industry has recorded a decrease of 9%.Vertex’s track record has been impressive so far. The company delivered positive earnings surprises in each of the last four quarters. The average positive earnings surprise for the last four quarters is 25.31%. In the last reported quarter, Vertex came up with a positive surprise of 5.17%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this quarter.Factors at PlayVertex’s cystic fibrosis (""CF"") drugs — Kalydeco & Orkambi — performed consistently in 2017, with sales rising almost 30%. We expect this positive trend to continue in the soon-to-be reported quarter.However, the company announced on its last quarter earnings call that first-quarter revenues will be unfavorably impacted by higher gross to net revenue adjustments and buildup of channel inventory in the fourth quarter of 2017.In January 2018, Vertex announced that an extension of the marketing application for Orkambi was approved in Europe. With the approval, Orkambi’s marketing label in EU will now include use in children with CF aged between six and 11 years and have two copies of the F508del mutation, expanding patient population by about 3,400. The expanded patient population is expected to boost sales of the drug. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Orkambi’s sales in the first quarter is $368 million.In 2017, Kalydeco received approval for two line extensions including in patients 2 years and older with certain residual mutations in CFTR gene. The drug generated significant sales last year due to rapid uptake in expanded patient population and we expect the trend to continue. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter Kalydeco sales is pegged at $228 millionIn a boost to Vertex’s CF franchise, the FDA approved Vertex’s third CF drug, Symdeko, which is a combination of tezacaftor and ivacaftor, in February 2018. The drug is under review in Europe. However, we expect the new drug to contribute minimally to first-quarter sales. We expect the company to provide update on Symdeko’s commercialization plan and its initial uptake.The company remains focused on development of its triple-combination regimens. During the quarter, Vertex advanced VX-659 and VX-445 for phase III development. Also, two phase III studies were initiated, evaluating VX-659 in combination with tezacaftor and Kalydeco (ivacaftor) in CF patients.Investor focus on the call will be on these triple combination CF regimens, which are crucial for long-term growth of Vertex. The company is also likely to provide full year revenue guidance including Symdeko sales on the call.However, operating expenses are likely to be on the higher side due to initiation of two pivotal studies and launch of Symdeko.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model indicates that Vertex is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate (62 cents) and the Zacks Consensus Estimate (57 cents), stands at +8.28%. This is a leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Vertex has a Zacks Rank #3.

688,VRTX,"The year 2017 has been better than expected for the biotech sector. The NASDAQ Biotechnology index was up 18.7% in 2017. While drug pricing issue, competition and a slowdown in growth of key drugs are expected to remain a hangover in 2018 as well, approval of new drugs and strategic acquisitions by several big wigs in 2017 are likely to boost investors’ sentiments. Thus 2018 needless to say, holds promise for generating stellar returns.The slowdown in mature products compelled bigwigs like Gilead Sciences (GILD  -  Free Report) to undertake acquisitions to bolster pipelines.

689,VRTX,"Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (VRTX  -  Free Report) may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Vertex Pharmaceuticals is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for VRTX in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at 62 cents per share for VRTX, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of 57 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for VRTX, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +8.28% heading into earnings season.Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise | Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10-year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here).Given that VRTX has a Zacks Rank #3 and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings.

690,VRTX,"The current year began on widespread optimism, predicting a significant increase in drug/biotech mergers and acquisitions (M&A) activity, mainly buoyed by the new tax law enacted in December 2017 and purchasing newer technologies. The tax reform has lowered the tax rate and provided a low-tax window to bring back huge cash stashed overseas. These will certainly improve the cash position of the companies and fuel M&A activities amid struggling organic growth.With a quarter of the year already gone by, we have seen quite a few billion dollar buyout deals being inked. For instance, Celgene Corporation acquired Juno Therapeutics to add a CAR-T therapy to its pipeline for approximately $9 billion. Moreover, the company is in process to complete the acquisition of Impact Biomedicines for an upfront amount of $1.1 billion. Also, Sanofi in a bid to strengthen its blood disorder pipeline purchased Bioverativ for $11.6 billion and even offered to buy Belgian Biotech Company, Ablynx for $4.8 billion.Additionally, Pfizer is aggressively on the lookout for a buyer for its Consumer Healthcare unit after British firms Glaxo and Reckitt Benckiser Group withdrew from discussions. However, Glaxo announced its acquisition of Novartis’ (NVS  -  Free Report) stake in their healthcare joint venture for $13 billion. Meanwhile late last month, Takeda also confirmed its intention to integrate Dublin-based Shire into its portfolio to boost its core therapeutic areas.Moreover, this week bore news of a couple of more M&A deals. A brief description of the two deals is as follows:Novartis to Buy AveXisNovartis inked a deal to acquire the U.S. based clinical stage gene therapy company, AveXis, Inc , to boost its presence in gene therapy and neuroscience space.AveXis’ lead gene therapy candidate, AVXS-101, is being developed to treat spinal muscular atrophy (""SMA""), a neurodegenerative disease, accounting for the highest genetic cause of death in infants. The only approved treatment for SMA is the Biogen’s Spinraza.Per the agreement, Novartis will close the acquisition in an all cash deal of $8.7 billion. The company proposed a cash-tender offer of $218 per share for AveXis’ common stock. The deal is expected to culminate in the second half of 2018. (Read more: Novartis Inks $8.7 Billion Gene Therapy Deal to Buy AveXis)Alexion-Wilson DealAlexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (ALXN  -  Free Report) announced that it will consolidate Sweden-based Wilson Therapeutics in its portfolio to add a late-stage candidate to its pipeline for the treatment of Wilson disease, a rare genetic disorder. The acquisition is line with the company’s strategy to diversify its portfolio and lower its dependence on its blockbuster drug, Soliris.Alexion has offered 232 Swedish Krona in cash for each outstanding share of Wilson Therapeutics, which translates into a total transaction value of $855 million. The buyout is expected to get wrapped up this quarter. (Read more: Alexion to Acquire Wilson Therapeutics for $855M)In this article, we suggest three drug/biotech companies as logical acquisition targets this year. The parameters counting for buying a drug/biotech stock are the current sales performance of its drugs/products, prospects of future sales growth and the quality of the company’s pipeline. Takeovers of small-cap drug/biotech companies are very difficult to forecast and are quite frequent in the said space. Hence, these have been excluded from the discussion.Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (AGIO  -  Free Report)Agios Pharmaceuticals’ share price is witnessed to rally this week on speculations that the company might be bought by other big players in the pharma and biotech industry.The company received an FDA approval for Idhifa (enasidenib) in August 2017 for treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (“AML”) with IDH2 mutation, lending a huge boost to its immense commercial potential in the target market. Agios’ ivosidenib is under review in the United States as a therapy for relapsed/refractory AML with IDH1 mutation. The candidate is also being developed for addressing advanced hematologic malignancies.Agios’ pipeline also includes a mid-stage genetic diseases candidate. A consistent progress with its investigational candidates makes the company one of the most lucrative takeover options for other large players in the drug/biotech space at the moment.

(BMRN  -  Free Report)Companies with product/pipeline portfolios comprising rare disease drugs are in great demand as there is less competition in the concerned space and the expensive treatments can garner huge profits. BioMarin is one such drug developer with a market cap of around $15 billion.BioMarin’s key orphan disease drugs, Vimizim and Kuvan, are doing well, backed by strong underlying patient demand trends. Also, another orphan drug Brineura’s earlier-than-expected approval this year for the treatment of children with CLN2 disease is likely to be a huge boost to BioMarin. A potential approval for pegvaliase is expected next month.BioMarin has already been a target of takeover speculation. Companies like Gilead, Amgen and Roche might be interested in buying BioMarin.BioMarin carries a Zacks Rank #3.Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (VRTX  -  Free Report)For Vertex, a consistent expansion in patient population raised revenues quarter to quarter throughout 2017. Moreover, the approval to its third cystic fibrosis (“CF”) drug, Symdeko (tezacaftor/ivacaftor combination), will further drive the company’s sales. The company is hopeful that a positive trend of CF sales will continue in 2018 as it gains additional reimbursement approvals for Orkambi in the ex-U.S. marketsMeanwhile, the company is focused on triple combination therapies for treating CF, which will further expand its patient population. The market cap of Vertex is more than $40 billion.Vertex carries a Zacks Rank #3.Incyte Corporation(INCY  -  Free Report)Incyte’s strong oncology portfolio makes it an attractive pick for companies, namely Gilead, Amgen and Bristol Myers. Incyte’s market cap is also around $15 billion.The primary reason why Incyte is ready for buyout is because of the encouraging performance of its two marketed products such as, Jakafi and Iclusig. Jakafi is seeing a strong sales performance, driven by solid patient demand in the approved indications.The company is also working on its further label expansion. Meanwhile, Incyte’s pipeline boasts candidates like immune therapy epacadostat, which is being studied in combination with other drugs for the cure of cancer and rheumatoid arthritis.Incyte carries a Zacks Rank #3.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

691,VRTX,"Proteostasis Therapeutics, Inc.’s (PTI  -  Free Report) shares surged more than 160% on Dec 12 after the announcement of positive results from studies evaluating its three cystic fibrosis (""CF"") pipeline candidates. The three candidates include PTI-428 (a cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator [CFTR] amplifier), PTI-801 (a CFTR corrector) and PTI-808 (a CFTR potentiator).PTI-428 and PTI-801 were evaluated in patients who were on background therapy with Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated’s (VRTX  -  Free Report) Orkambi.Shares of the company were up 60.7% in the past six months, outperforming the industry’s decline of 0.6% in that period.The most advanced candidate, PTI-428, was evaluated in a phase II study in CF patients on background Orkambi therapy. Data showed that the addition of PTI-428 to Orkambi had mean absolute improvements in ppFEV1 (a measure of the lung function used for the disease) of 5.2% from baseline compared to placebo. It also showed a mean relative improvement of 9.2%. Data demonstrates that PTI-428 amplifies the effect of Orkambi in responding patients (ppFEV1 <70% at baseline).The dose ranging phase I study evaluating PTI-801 showed a mean improvement in ppFEV1 of approximately 4% from baseline. Moreover, a phase I study evaluating PTI-808 showed that the candidate is well tolerated in patient population.Proteostasis is also evaluating the combination of PTI-428, PTI-801 and PTI-808 in CF patients in an early stage study.

692,VRTX,"Making its debut on 06/23/2005, smart beta exchange traded fund PowerShares Dynamic Biotechnology & Genome Portfolio (PBE  -  Free Report) provides investors broad exposure to the Health Care ETFs category of the U.S. equity market.What Are Smart Beta ETFs?Market cap weighted indexes were created to reflect the market, or a specific segment of the market, and the ETF industry has traditionally been dominated by products based on this strategy.Investors who believe in market efficiency should consider market cap indexes, as they replicate market returns in a low-cost, convenient, and transparent way.But, there are some investors who would rather invest in smart beta funds; these funds track non-cap weighted strategies, and are a strong option for those who prefer choosing great stocks in order to beat the market.These indexes attempt to select stocks that have better chances of risk-return performance, based on certain fundamental characteristics or a combination of such characteristics.Even though this space provides many choices to investors--think one of the simplest methodologies like equal-weighting and more complicated ones like fundamental and volatility/momentum based weighting--not all have been able to deliver first-rate results.Fund Sponsor & IndexPBE is managed by Invesco Powershares, and this fund has amassed over $238.34 M, which makes it one of the average sized ETFs in the Health Care ETFs. PBE, before fees and expenses, seeks to match the performance of the Dynamic Biotechnology & Genome Intellidex Index.This is comprised of stocks of 30 U.S. biotechnology and genome companies. These are companies that are principally engaged in the research, development, manufacture and marketing and distribution of various biotechnological products, services and processes and companies that benefit significantly from scientific and technological advances in biotechnology and genetic engineering and research.Cost & Other ExpensesWhen considering an ETF's total return, expense ratios are an important factor. And, cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive cousins in the long term if all other factors remain equal.Operating expenses on an annual basis are 0.58% for PBE, making it on par with most peer products in the space.The fund has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 0.44%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsEven though ETFs offer diversified exposure which minimizes single stock risk, it is still important to look into a fund's holdings before investing. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.This ETF has heaviest allocation in the Healthcare sector - about 100% of the portfolio.When you look at individual holdings, Illumina Inc (ILMN  -  Free Report) accounts for about 5.45% of the fund's total assets, followed by Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc (VRTX  -  Free Report) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc (REGN  -  Free Report).Its top 10 holdings account for approximately 45.9% of PBE's total assets under management.Performance and RiskThe ETF has added roughly 3.16% so far this year and is up about 17.49% in the last one year (as of 04/12/2018). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $41.34 and $54.07.The ETF has a beta of 1.38 and standard deviation of 28.06% for the trailing three-year period, making it a high choice in the space. With about 31 holdings, it has more concentrated exposure than peers.AlternativesPowerShares Dynamic Biotechnology & Genome Portfolio is an excellent option for investors seeking to outperform the Health Care ETFs segment of the market. There are other ETFs in the space which investors could consider as well.SPDR S&P Biotech ETF (XBI  -  Free Report) tracks S&P Biotechnology Select Industry Index and the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF (IBB  -  Free Report) tracks Nasdaq Biotechnology Index. SPDR S&P Biotech ETF has $4.65 B in assets, iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF has $8.80 B. XBI has an expense ratio of 0.35% and IBB charges 0.47%.Investors looking for cheaper and lower-risk options should consider traditional market cap weighted ETFs that aim to match the returns of the Health Care ETFs.Bottom LineTo learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.

693,VRTX,"Last year turned out to be pretty good for pharma and biotech stocks as far as FDA decisions are concerned. The regulatory body approved 46 novel drugs, easily surpassing 2016’s total tally of 22.Landmark decisions last year include the approval of a couple of gene-based therapies for cancer – Novartis’s (NVS  -  Free Report) Kymriah and Gilead Sciences’ (GILD  -  Free Report) Yescarta. These therapies have the potential to change the way we look at cancer treatments.With just a quarter gone by this year, the FDA has already granted approval to six new treatments. Key approvals include J&J’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) next-generation oral androgen receptor (“AR”) inhibitor Erleada (apalutamide) for pre-metastatic prostate cancer (CRPC), Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated’s (VRTX  -  Free Report) third medicine to treat the underlying cause of CF, Symdeko, which is a combination of tezacaftor and ivacaftor, Gilead’s once-daily single tablet HIV regimen Biktarvy and Novartis’s Lutathera for certain gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors.With the drug development process being lengthy and time-consuming, plus requiring the utilization of a lot of funds and resources, key pipeline events including data readouts and regulatory updates are of paramount importance and could act as major catalysts. Let’s take a look at a few important regulatory events scheduled for the month of April.Note that this month, the FDA has already approved Pacira Pharmaceuticals’s Exparel for a new indication as a nerve block for regional analgesia and Clovis Oncology’s PARP inhibitor Rubraca as maintenance therapy for recurrent ovarian cancer.Second Indication for Novartis’ Kymriah: On Apr 30, the FDA is expected to give its decision on Novartis’ supplemental biologics license application (BLA) looking for approval of Kymriah for its second indication. With the latest filing, Novartis is looking to get Kymriah approved for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBLC) — most common form of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma — who have failed two or more prior therapies. Kymriah was approved for the treatment of a deadly cancer called acute lymphoblastic leukemia last August. According to the company’s annual report, 10-15% of DLBLC patients do not respond to initial therapy or relapse within three months of treatment, indicating the significant market potential for Kymriah in the DLBLC indication.FDA Decision on Mallinckrodt’s Label Expansion of Amitiza in Children: Mallinckrodt plc’s (MNK  -  Free Report) supplemental new drug application (sNDA) looking to get its constipation drug Amitiza approved for paediatric functional constipation between six and 17 years, is under review. The FDA is expected to give its decision on Apr 28. Amtiza was added to Mallinckrodt’s portfolio with the February acquisition of Sucampo Pharmaceuticals.Amitiza is already approved for chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC) in adults, irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C) among adult women and opioid-induced constipation (OIC) in patients with chronic non-cancer pain. According to the company’s press release, Amitiza, if approved for paediatric functional constipation, would be the first and only prescription medication specifically approved for such patients, who have limited treatment options to address their disease.Will an FDA Panel Back GW Pharmaceuticals’ Epidiolex and Incyte/Lilly’s Olumiant? An FDA panel is expected to give its opinion on GW Pharmaceuticals’ lead cannabinoid pipeline candidate, Epidiolex, next week. GW Pharmaceuticals is looking to get Epidiolex approved as an adjunctive treatment for seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (“LGS”) and Dravet syndrome. Both are highly treatment-resistant forms of childhood-onset epilepsy.With the FDA granting priority review to Epidiolex’s NDA, a response from the FDA is expected by Jun 27, 2018. Epidiolex represents blockbuster potential especially if it is approved across all possible indications.An FDA panel is also expected to give its opinion this month on Incyte/Lilly’s (LLY  -  Free Report) Olumiant (baricitinib) for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis. In April 2017, the companies had received a complete response letter (CRL) from the FDA for baricitinib. The FDA required additional clinical data. TheNDA for Olumiant was re-submitted in January. Olumiant has already been launched in select European countries and in Japan, and fetched sales of $46 million in 2017.Although the FDA takes the recommendations of its panels/advisory committe into account while reviewing applications, it is not bound to follow the same.FDA Decisions for Rigel’s Tavalisse and Ultragenyx’s Burosumab on April 17: The FDA is expected to give its decision on Rigel Pharmaceuticals NDA for Tavalisse (fostamatinib) for the treatment of chronic immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) on Apr 17. Rigel is preparing for the launch of this oral spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) inhibitor in the second quarter, if approved. Existing therapies to treat chronic ITP include steroids, blood platelet production boosters (TPOs) and splenectomy. However, still the disease remains inadequately treated in many patients. This means that if approved, Tavalisse should enjoy significant market potential.Another FDA decision expected on Apr 17 is on Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical’s BLA for burosumab to treat pediatric and adult patients with X-Linked Hypophosphatemia (XLH). Burosumab was approved for treating XLH by the trade name of Crysvita in the EU in February.FDA to Decide on Prometic’s Ryplazim: This FDA decision, expected on Apr 14, will be on Canadian biotech Prometic Life Sciences’ biologics license application (BLA) for Ryplazim for the treatment of congenital plasminogen deficiency. Ryplazim enjoyed Orphan Drug and Fast Track Designations by the FDA for the said indication.Bristol Myers’ Opdivo+Yervoy Combo to Get FDA Approval? Bristol Myers (BMY  -  Free Report) has filed an sBLA looking get its blockbuster drug Opdivo approved in combination with its another cancer drug Yervoy in patients with previously untreated advanced or metastatic renal cell carcinoma (“RCC”). The FDA decision is expected in Apr 16.In clinical studies, the combination has demonstrated superior overall survival (OS) compared with the current standard of care sunitinib in intermediate- and poor-risk patients. This bodes well for the drug given the potential in the targeted market.The PD-1 inhibitor is presently approved in several countries including the United States, the EU and Japan for several cancer indications. Label expansion should boost Opdivo’s sales further. Opdivo generated sales of almost $5 billion in 2017.Bristol-Myers is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

694,VRTX,"Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.(VRTX  -  Free Report) announced that the European Commission has approved an extension of the marketing application for its cystic fibrosis product, Orkambi. With the approval, Orkambi’s marketing label in EU will now include use in children with CF aged between six and 11 years and have two copies of the F508del mutation.The label expansion approval in EU was based on positive data from asix-month phase III efficacy study in this patient population. Data from the study, presented in November 2016, demonstrated that treatment with Orkambi led to a statistically significant improvement in absolute change in lung clearance index – a measure of lung function in early CF disease – compared with placebo through 24 weeks of treatment.Approval for this age group would expand the targeted patient population by about 3,400 patients.In Ireland, Vertex already has reimbursement agreements for use in these children while in other countries, a country-by-country reimbursement process will now be initiated by Vertex.Please note that in the United States, Orkambi is already marketed for this patient population since September 2016.Year 2017 was a tremendous one for Vertex with positive data read-outs and regulatory approvals leading to an increase in eligible patient population for Kalydeco & Orkambi. With a consistent expansion in patient population, Vertex’s CF product revenues increased through 2017. With the latest label expansion approval in EU, it looks like the trend will continue in 2018.The company is optimistic that the positive trend in CF sales will continue in 2018 as it gains additional reimbursement approvals for Orkambi in ex-U.S. markets and gets approval to launch tezacaftor (VX-661)/ivacaftor combination medicine.The stock has surged 92.1% in the past year, substantially outperforming the 1% increase registered by the industry.Estimates have also moved northward in the past 30 days.Vertex’s CF pipeline is also quite strong with a broad portfolio of next-generation CF correctors. Vertex also made decent clinical progress across multiple CF studies in 2017 and has meaningful pipeline catalysts. Investor focus is on triple combination CF regimens, which are crucial for long-term growth as these have the potential to treat up to 90% of CF patients. Vertex plans to initiatepivotal phase III studies on up to two of the four triple combination regimens in the first half of 2018.Vertex sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Some other biotech stocks worth considering are Exelixis, Inc. (EXEL  -  Free Report), XOMA Corporation (XOMA  -  Free Report) and Paratek Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (PRTK  -  Free Report). While Exelixis has the same rank as Vertex, XOMA and Paratek carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

695,VRTX,"This week, the focus is on the 36th annual J.P. Morgan healthcare conference where several biotech and pharma companies provided a preliminary look at their results for 2017 and have also provided pipeline updates as well as their outlooks for 2018. Meanwhile, Celgene (CELG  -  Free Report) was in the news with the company announcing its intention to acquire Impact Biomedicines.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesCelgene to Buy Impact: Celgene has started the year with an acquisition announcement – the company will be acquiring Impact Biomedicines, which is developing fedratinib for myelofibrosis and polycythemia vera. The deal terms include an upfront payment of approximately $1.1 billion and contingent payments of up to $1.25 billion based on the achievement of regulatory approval milestones for myelofibrosis. Celgene could make additional payments based on approvals for label expansion and the achievement of sales-based milestones. Plans are on to submit a new drug application to the FDA in mid-2018. Celgene is looking to boost its pipeline with this acquisition. The company had a rough 2017 with shares declining 12.1% over the last one year. Issues like pipeline setbacks as well as the weak performance of Otezla have been weighing on the stock (Read more: Celgene to Acquire Impact Biomedicines to Boost Pipeline).Key Takeaways from J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference: Several biotech companies were present at the 36th annual J.P. Morgan healthcare conference. Most of these companies provided a preliminary look at fourth quarter results and their outlook for 2018. Among key updates, Acorda (ACOR  -  Free Report) could start facing generic competition for its flagship drug, Ampyra, any time after Jul 30, 2018. The company is currently seeking FDA approval for Inbrija for which a response could be out in February (Read more: Acorda's Shares Down on Disappointing Ampyra View for 2018).

The candidate failed to meet the primary efficacy endpoints in studies that were conducted in patients with dementia with Lewy bodies (“DLB”) and patients with dementia and gait impairment. Based on this, Axovant has decided to discontinue the development of intepirdine.This is not the first time that Axovant has faced a setback in its development efforts for intepirdine. Last year in September, the company had said that intepirdine failed to meet its co-primary efficacy endpoints in a late-stage study being conducted in mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease (""AD"") patients who were receiving background donepezil therapy. At that time too, the company’s shares had plunged significantly (73.9%). Axovant’s shares are down 81.7% over the last one year compared to the 3.3% decline recorded by the industry it belongs to.Regeneron & Sanofi Boost R&D Investment in Dupixent and Cemiplimab: Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN  -  Free Report) and partner Sanofi have decided to boost their investment in the development of cemiplimab (a PD-1 antibody) in oncology and Dupixent (an IL-4/IL-13 pathway-blocking antibody) in type 2 allergic diseases. Based on this decision, investment in cemiplimab will shoot up to at least $1.64 billion, an increase of approximately $1 billion from the initial agreement, with both companies contributing equally. Cemiplimab is being studied as monotherapy as well as in combination with other therapies in a wide range of cancers including advanced skin cancers, non-small cell lung cancer, cervical cancer and lymphomas. Regulatory applications for cemiplimab in advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma are scheduled to be submitted in the European Union and the United States in the first quarter of 2018.  Meanwhile, Dupixent, currently approved for eczema, has the potential to be evaluated for additional indications including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, peanut allergy and grass allergy and in patients who have multiple allergic conditions. This is in addition to ongoing development in pediatric atopic dermatitis, pediatric asthma, eosinophilic esophagitis and nasal polyposis. Regeneron and Sanofi are currently seeking FDA approval for Dupixent in uncontrolled, persistent asthma in patients at least 12 years old.Another candidate that should benefit from the additional investment is REGN3500, an IL-33 antibody, with potential indications including atopic dermatitis, asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.AbbVie Eczema Drug Gets BTD: AbbVie’s (ABBV  -  Free Report) investigational, once-daily oral JAK1-selective inhibitor, upadacitinib, has been granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation (“BTD”) by the FDA for use in adult patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis who are candidates for systemic therapy.Breakthrough Therapy Designation helps fasten the development and review of drugs which are being evaluated for the treatment of serious conditions and where preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may be substantially better than existing treatments on clinically significant endpoint(s). Upadacitinib is scheduled to move into a late-stage program for atopic dermatitis in the first half of the year (Read more: AbbVie's Upadacitinib Gains Breakthrough Therapy Designation).PerformanceMedical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % Return Medical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % ReturnThe NASDAQ Biotechnology Index declined 0.3% over the last four trading sessions.

696,VRTX,"The Q4 earnings season for the pharma/biotech sector was scattered with a few small biotech companies yet to report. The releases so far provide us with a clear picture of the sector’s performance.Overall, the sector performed reasonably well. Among the biotech/pharma bigwigs, Gilead (GILD  -  Free Report), Celgene (CELG  -  Free Report) and Vertex (VRTX  -  Free Report) beat earnings and revenue estimates. Meanwhile, Biogen (BIIB  -  Free Report) announced mixed results with earnings beating estimates and sales lagging the same. However, Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report) had a rather weak quarter as it missed expectations for earnings and sales and also issued a lower-than-expected sales guidance for 2018.Drug/biotech stocks remained on a growth trajectory in 2017. Ramp up in new product sales, successful innovation and product line expansion, favorable clinical study results, frequent FDA approvals, strong performance by key products, growing demand for drugs especially for rare-to-treat diseases, an aging population and increased health care spending are some of the factors that should keep driving the sector. A faster drug approval process, the proposed removal of outdated regulations that push up costs and a slowdown in innovation should also prove beneficial.The year started off on expectations of a pick-up in M&A activity. The new tax law, which cuts corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% and encourages companies to bring back huge cash held overseas at a one-time tax rate of 10%, is expected to spur merger activity this year.Sanofi (SNY  -  Free Report), earlier this year, announced deals to buy Belgian biotech company, Ablynx, and haemophilia-focused biotech firm — Bioverativ.Banking on the positive trend and impressive Q4 performance, it might be the perfect time to cash in on the bountiful prospects in this growing market. Here we have picked three biotech stocks which saw positive estimate revisions post Q4 earnings release and also flaunt a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Earnings estimate revisions have the greatest impact on stock prices. Stocks with rising estimates have significantly outperformed the S&P 500 index year after year. Hence, investors can safely bet on stocks that have been seeing an upward movement in earnings estimates. All the three companies have also seen a steady rally in the share price post Q4 results.Ligand Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (LGND  -  Free Report)The San Diego, CA-based biotechnology company, Ligand, carries a Zacks Rank #2. The stock witnessed positive estimate revision over the last 30 days. The company released fourth-quarter earnings on Feb 21. It has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 earnings rise 9.8% for 2018 and 21.1% for 2019. The company surpassed earnings and revenue estimates in fourth-quarter 2017 mainly on higher royalty revenues. Additionally, shares of the company have rallied 16.8% post its Q4 earnings release.Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (REGN  -  Free Report)The Tarrytown, NY-based biopharmaceutical company, Regeneron, witnessed positive estimate revision over the last 60 days. The company released fourth-quarter earnings on Feb 8. The Zacks Rank #1 stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings rise 9.7% and 6.4% for 2018 and 2019, respectively. Regeneron’s fourth-quarter results were impressive as both earnings and sales beat estimates on strong sales of the company’s key marketed drug, Eylea. Shares of the company have rallied 7.1% after it released Q4 earnings release.Horizon Pharma plc (HZNP  -  Free Report)Based in Dublin, Ireland, Horizon Pharma carries a Zacks Rank #2. The company has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings move 10% up in the last 30 days for 2018 and 14.9% for 2019. The company released fourth-quarter earnings on Feb 26. Shares of the company have gained 5% post Q4 earnings announcement. Horizon Pharma also beat earnings and sales estimates in fourth-quarter 2017 backed by strong performance by its Orphan unit. The company’s sales guidance for 2018 is encouraging as well.OutlookWhile 2017 was strong, this year is expected to be a vital one for the biotech sector as these companies continue to invest in pipeline, build global business and drive new product growth.Zacks Top 10 Stocks for 2018In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest buy-and-hold tickers for the entirety of 2018?Last year's 2017 Zacks Top 10 Stocks portfolio produced double-digit winners, including FMC Corp. and VMware which racked up stellar gains of +67.9% and +61%.

697,VRTX,"CAR-T stocks were in the news this week with key biotech player, Gilead Sciences (GILD  -  Free Report) announcing its intention to acquire Kite Pharma , one of the most advanced players in the CAR-T therapy market. Moreover, the FDA approved Novartis’ Kymriah yesterday, making it the first CAR-T therapy to gain approval in the U.S.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesGilead Looks to Boost Oncology Pipeline with Kite Deal: Gilead has finally announced an M&A deal with the company saying that it will acquire Kite Pharma for $180 per share in cash or approximately $11.9 billion. Gilead has been under a lot of pressure to utilize its huge pile of cash for a major acquisition deal given the dwindling sales of its erstwhile top-selling hepatitis C virus (""HCV"") franchise. The Kite acquisition, slated to close in the fourth quarter, will place Gilead among the top players in the emerging field of cell therapy. Kite’s expertise lies in developing engineered cell therapies that express either a chimeric antigen receptor (""CAR"") or an engineered T cell receptor (""TCR""), depending on the type of cancer.Kite already has a CAR-T therapy, axicabtagene ciloleucel (axi-cel), under priority FDA review with a response expected by Nov 29, 2017. EU approval could come next year. Axi-cel is under review for the treatment of refractory aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma (""NHL""), which includes diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (""DLBCL""), transformed follicular lymphoma (""TFL"") and primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (""PMBCL""). Other candidates in Kite’s pipeline include those targeting hematologic cancers as well as solid tumors (Also read: Gilead to Fly High with Kite Pharma Acquisition for $11.9B). Axi-cel has blockbuster potential though Novartis is currently the first company to gain approval in the U.S. for a CAR-T treatment with the FDA approving the company’s Kymriah.Kite’s shares were up 28% following the acquisition news while year to date, the stock has gained 296.9%, substantially outperforming the 9.7% rally of the industry it belongs to.With the Kite-Gilead deal being announced, other companies involved in CAR-T treatment saw their shares shooting up on hopes that more M&A deals will be announced in this segment of the market. While Juno shot up 20.1%, bluebird bio was up 8.6%.   Gilead is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock.

The companies, which had previously said that they expect a delay of at least 18 months in the resubmission of the regulatory application for baricitinib, announced that they will be resubmitting the regulatory application by Jan 2018. New safety and efficacy data will be included in the resubmission. Investors reacted positively to the news sending Incyte’s shares up 10.6%.The Medicines Co.’s Vabomere Gets FDA Nod: The Medicines Company (MDCO  -  Free Report) got a boost with the accelerated approval of Vabomere for the treatment of adult patients with complicated urinary tract infections, including pyelonephritis. The drug addresses pathogens designated by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (""CDC"") as urgent and serious antimicrobial resistance threats, and pathogens cited by the World Health Organization (""WHO"") as a critical need for new antibiotics. Vabomere will enjoy an additional 5 years of exclusivity given its status as a Qualified Infectious Disease Product (""QIDP"") under the Generating Antibiotics Incentives Now (""GAIN"") Act. The Medicines Company intends to launch Vabomere in the fourth quarter.Priority Review for BioMarin Drug: BioMarin Pharmaceutical’s (BMRN  -  Free Report) pegvaliase got priority review in the U.S. for the reduction of blood phenylalanine (Phe) levels in adult patients with phenylketonuria (""PKU"") who have uncontrolled blood Phe levels on existing management. This means a response from the agency regarding the approval status of pegvaliase should be out by Feb 28, 2018. However, with the FDA asking the company to submit additional Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls (""CMC"") information, BioMarin said that it expects the review period to be extended by an additional three months (Also read: BioMarin's Pegvaliase BLA Granted Priority Review by the FDA).Acorda Down on Inbrija Regulatory Update: Acorda Therapeutics (ACOR  -  Free Report) saw its shares fall 24.3% on news that the FDA has issued a Refusal to File ('RTF"") letter for Inbrija. The agency has raised two questions in the RTF – one regarding the date when the manufacturing site will be ready for inspection and the other regarding the submission of the drug master production record.

698,VRTX,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (VRTX  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 5.2% in that time frame, underperforming the market.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Vertex Q2 Earnings and Sales Top on Strong CF SalesVertex reported second-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings per share of 39 cents which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 35 cents. Meanwhile, earnings rose 63% year over year.  Strong product revenues led to higher profits in the quarter.Vertex reported revenues of $544.1 million in the second quarter, up 26.1% year over year driven by strong product revenues. Revenues also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $487.9 million by 11.5%.CF Franchise Sales StrongVertex’s second-quarter revenues consisted of sales from cystic fibrosis (CF) products — Kalydeco and Orkambi, collaborative ($27.3 million) and royalty revenues ($2.9 million). CF product revenues were $514 million in the second quarter, up 21% year over year.Kalydeco sales rose 5% to $190 million, gaining from inventory stocking of $5 million ahead of the Jul 4 holiday.Orkambi (lumacaftor/ivacaftor) delivered sales of $324.0 million, up 32% year over year. On a sequential basis, Orkambi sales rose almost 10% in the second quarter, supported by continued uptake globally and further uptake in the pediatric indication for which approval was received in Sep 2016. Meanwhile, pharmacy orders of approximately $10 million ahead of the Jul 4 holiday also benefited sales in the second quarter. This inventory stocking and a seasonal summer slowdown may hurt revenues in the third quarter.Costs RiseAdjusted (including stock-based compensation expenses) research and development expenses increased 10% to $284.3 million in the second quarter due to higher costs related to development of triple combination CF regimens. Adjusted (including stock-based compensation expenses) selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased 10.7% to $121.7 million due to increased investment to support the global launch of Orkambi.Maintains 2017 GuidanceVertex maintained its 2017 guidance for Orkambi and Kalydeco sales but raised its guidance for combined operating costs.Orkambi revenues are expected in the range of $1.1–$1.3 billion while Kalydeco revenues are estimated in the range of $740 million - $770 million. Total CF product revenues are expected in the range of $1.84 billion to $2.07 billion in 2017.Management continues to believe that Orkambi sales growth will be dependent on reimbursement discussions in Europe in 2017. In June and July this year, Vertex struck re-imbursement agreements in Ireland and Italy, respectively, for Orkambi. Meanwhile, reimbursement discussions are ongoing with other countries, including France, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. Specifically, the company has mentioned that if it gains reimbursement in France this year, it will contribute significantly to revenue growth.Combined adjusted research and development (R&D) and selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses in 2017 are anticipated in the range of $1.33 to $1.36 billion, higher than $1.25–$1.30 billion expected previously.Costs are expected to be higher due to accelerated development of the triple combination CF pipeline and investment to develop CTP-656.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?It turns out, fresh estimate have trended upward during the past month. There has been five revisions higher for the current quarter.Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated Price and Consensus  Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated Price and Consensus | Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated QuoteVGM ScoresAt this time, the stock has a great Growth Score of A, though it is lagging a lot on the momentum front with an F.

699,VRTX,"Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (VRTX  -  Free Report) announced that its regulatory applications for tezacaftor/ivacaftor (Kalydeco) combination have been accepted by the FDA and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for review.The regulatory applications have been filed to seek approval of Kalydeco in combination with tezacaftor (VX-661) for the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients (12 and older) with two copies of the F508del mutation.We note that Kalydeco is already approved for the treatment of patients (two years and above) with CF who have one of 33 mutations in their cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene.Meanwhile, the application in the U.S. has been granted a priority review with the FDA expected to give its decision on Feb 28, 2018.Shares of Vertex were up 1.9% on Thursday. In-fact, Vertex’s share price is up a massive 111.9% so far this year, comparing favorably with an increase of 7.9%for the industry.Coming back to the latest news, the regulatory applications in the U.S. and EU were submitted on the basis of positive outcome from two phase III studies – EVOLVE and EXPAND. Data from the studies was announced in March this year. Both studies met their primary endpoints and demonstrated statistically significant improvements in lung function in patients with CF.The combination had also been granted Orphan Drug designation by the FDA.Per the company’s press release, approximately 75,000 people in North America, Europe and Australia suffer from CF. In fact, more than 29% people of ages 12 years or older have two copies of the F508del mutation, and more than 1,500 people of the age 12 have one mutation. Hence, approval of the drug will provide the company access to a huge base of patients affected by the disease and bring it closer to the goal of serving people with the disease.In fact, Vertex’s CF pipeline is quite strong with a broad portfolio of next-generation CF correctors.Vertex is evaluating some next-generation CFTR correctors (VX-152, VX-440, VX-659 and VX-445) as part of a triple combination with tezacaftor and ivacaftor.Data from VX-152 and VX-440 phase II and VX-659 phase I triple combination studies, conducted on CF patients who have one F508del mutation and one minimal function mutation (F508del/Min), were presented in July 2017. The data demonstrated that all three combinations led to pronounced improvement in lung function. In fact, these are the first data to show the potential to treat the underlying cause of CF in patients who have a severe and difficult-to-treat type of the disease.Following discussions with regulatory agencies, Vertex will initiate pivotal phase III studies on one or two of the four triple combination regimens in the first half of 2018.Its triple combination CF regimens are considered crucial for long-term growth. If the triple-combo regimes are successful, Vertex can address a significantly larger CF patient population– almost 90% of patients with CF - in the future.Vertex carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Stocks to ConsiderBetter-ranked biotech stocks include Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (ALXN  -  Free Report), Ligand Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (LGND  -  Free Report) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (REGN  -  Free Report), all with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

700,VRTX,"Amgen, Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA has approved its supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) to expand the label of its key drug, Xgeva.Xgeva is currently approved for the prevention of skeletal-related events (SREs) in solid tumors in patients with bone metastases. With the latest FDA approval, the label of Xgeva will be expanded to include patients with multiple myeloma.The FDA decision comes earlier than the PDUFA date of Feb 2, 2018. A similar regulatory application is also under review in the EU.In the past year, Amgen’s shares have returned 13.8% in contrast to 1.7% decrease registered by the industry.The FDA approval was based on safety and efficacy from the pivotal phase III '482 study, which enrolled 1,718 patients. The head-to-head study, which compared Xgeva to Novartis AG’s (NVS  -  Free Report) Zometa (zoledronic acid), met the primary endpoint of non-inferiority of the drugs in delaying the time to first on-study SRE in patients with multiple myeloma.Bone complications in patients with multiple myeloma can be quite damaging. Until now, bisphosphonates were the only treatment option available for bone protection in multiple myeloma patients. However, bisphosphonates may cause renal toxicity and lead to renal impairment. Xgeva, which is not cleared through the kidneys, offers a better treatment option for such patients.Xgeva is key revenue driver for Amgen and generated revenues of $1.18 billion in the first nine months of 2017, up 3% year over year. We expect approval for the expanded patient population to help in further boosting sales of the drug.Amgen carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Better-ranked biotech stocks are Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc. (VRTX  -  Free Report) and Exelixis, Inc. (EXEL  -  Free Report), both with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

Vertex expects to file for approval in the United States and the EU for this patient population in the first quarter of 2018 (Read more: Vertex Kalydeco Study Successful in Children Aged 1-2 Years). Vertex’s shares are up 91.3% year to date, compared to the 3% gain recorded by the industry it belongs to.Repros to be acquired by Allergan: Repros Therapeutics saw its shares gaining 41.5% on news that it will be acquired by Allergan for a cash payment of 67 cents per share. The acquisition is expected to close in the first quarter of 2018. With this acquisition, Allergan is looking to boost its women’s health pipeline.

703,VRTX,"A key development this week was the FDA approval of the first cancer biosimilar - Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report) and Allergan’s Mvasi, a biosimilar version of Roche’s blockbuster cancer drug, Avastin. Other updates include important data presentations from companies like Nabriva Therapeutics (NBRV  -  Free Report) and AbbVie (ABBV  -  Free Report).Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesFirst Cancer Biosimilar Gets FDA Nod: The FDA approved Amgen and Allergan’s Mvasi, a biosimilar version of Roche’s blockbuster cancer drug, Avastin (bevacizumab). Mvasi can be used for all eligible indications of the reference product. Approval was in line with expectations considering the favorable vote the biosimilar got from an FDA advisory panel recently. The approval is quite a boost for the companies as well as the effort to lower drug prices though so far biosimilars are yet to make a significant dent in referenced product sales in the United States. Mvasi is under review in the EU (Read more: Amgen/Allergan's Avastin Biosimilar Secures FDA Approval).Nabriva up on Positive Antibiotic Data: Nabriva got a major boost with the company posting positive top-line results on oral lefamulin in patients with community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (“CABP”), the leading cause of infectious death in the United States. The LEAP 1 study, the first of two pivotal late-stage studies being conducted with lefamulin, met the FDA’s primary endpoint of non-inferiority compared to moxifloxacin with or without adjunctive linezolid for early clinical response. The European Medicines Agency’s (‘EMA”) criteria were also met. Nabriva is looking to position lefamulin as a first-line empiric monotherapy. The second pivotal study is currently enrolling with topline results expected next year in spring. Positive results would allow the company to file for FDA approval in the second half of 2018. Nabriva has gained 54.2% year to date, significantly outperforming the industry’s 15.6% rally (Read more: Nabriva's Lefamulin Positive in Pivotal Study, Stock Surges).No FDA Advisory Panel Meeting for BioMarin Drug: BioMarin Pharmaceutical (BMRN  -  Free Report), known for its strong presence in the market for serious and life-threatening rare disorders, said that the FDA is not looking to hold an advisory panel meeting for the company’s Biologics License Application (“BLA”) for pegvaliase. BioMarin is looking to get pegvaliase approved for the reduction of blood phenylalanine (Phe) levels in adult patients with phenylketonuria (PKU) who have uncontrolled blood Phe levels on existing management. Pegvaliase is currently under priority review with a response from the FDA expected by Feb 28, 2018. However, this could well be pushed out by three months as the agency has asked BioMarin for additional Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls (“CMC”) information (Read more: BioMarin Says FDA Not Planning an AdCom for Pegvaliase BLA).TESARO’s Zejula a Step Closer to EU Nod: Cancer-focused TESARO (TSRO  -  Free Report) got some good news with the EMA's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) issuing a positive opinion for Zejula (niraparib) as a monotherapy for the maintenance treatment of adult patients with platinum-sensitive relapsed high grade serous epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who are in a complete or partial response to platinum-based chemotherapy. Given the positive opinion, chances of gaining EU approval look high. Approval would make Zejula the first oral, once-daily PARP 1/2 inhibitor in Europe for use in patients regardless of BRCA mutation or biomarker status. Zejula is already approved in the United States (Read more: TESARO Ovarian Cancer Drug Zejula Gets Positive CHMP Opinion).AbbVie/Roche Cancer Drug Positive in Late-Stage Study: AbbVie and partner Roche are looking to expand the label of their cancer therapy, Venclexta/Venclyxto and results from a late-stage study (MURANO) should help in these efforts. Venclexta plus Rituxan met the primary endpoint of prolonged progression-free survival compared with Treanda (bendamustine) plus Rituxan in patients with relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (“CLL”) in the MURANO study.  An independent data monitoring committee has recommended the unblinding of the study based on the positive results.

705,VRTX,"Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (VRTX  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA has granted approval to its cystic fibrosis (CF) corrector, tezacaftor (VX-661), in combination with ivacaftor (Kalydeco) under the brand name, Symdekotm. The combo therapy is approved to treat the underlying cause of CF in patients aged 12 years and above with certain mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator gene.This approval marks the company's third treatment for the underlying cause of CF. The company said that it is ready to launch the product in the U.S. market this week. With this nod from the regulatory agency, Vertex can address a significantly larger CF patient population in the United States.Notably, the combination regime is also under review in the EU with a decision expected in the second half of 2018.Vertex’s share price has soared 73.2% in a year’s time, comparing favorably with the industry’s decrease of 2.5%. The aforementioned approval was supported by positive data from two phase III studies on tezacaftor/ivacaftor combination, EVOLVE and EXPAND. Both trials met primary endpoints and demonstrated statistically significant improvements in lung function in two different CF-patient population. The combination treatment was found to be well tolerated in both cases.The company presently markets two CF drugs, Kalydeco and Orkambi, and also boasts a strong CF pipeline. Its broad portfolio of next-generation CF correctors could bring in multi-billion dollar sales for the company, if approved.Notably, Vertex is evaluating some next-generation CFTR correctors (VX-152, VX-440, VX-659 and VX-445) as part of a triple combination with tezacaftor and ivacaftor.Data from VX-152 and VX-440 phase II and VX-659 phase I triple combination programs presented in July 2017 showed that all three combos led to a marked improvement in lung function. The company is also developing the fourth next-generation corrector, VX-445, in a phase II study with data expected in early 2018.Meanwhile, the company is looking to buy CF candidates, which can be put together with tezacaftor and ivacaftor to create triple combinations. Last July, Vertex bought Concert Pharmaceuticals, Inc.’s (CNCE  -  Free Report) CF pipeline candidate, VX-561 (CTP-656). The company is developing the candidate as a promising once-daily triple combination compiled with other pipeline drugs to treat the underlying cause of CF.We remind investors that the CF market represents huge commercial potential. It is a rare, life-threatening disease estimated to affect about 75,000 people in North America, Europe and Australia. The CF combination regimens, if approved, can further strengthen the market position, translating into higher revenues.Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated Price Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated Price | Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated Quote Zacks Rank & Key PicksVertex carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

706,VRTX,"The fourth-quarter earnings season has crossed the halfway mark. So far, the results reflect a favorable trend, with an above average proportion of companies beating both top- and bottom-line expectations.Per the latest Earnings Preview, total earnings for the 251 S&P members that have released results, are up 16% from the year-ago quarter on a 10.5% rise in revenues. The beat ratio for the bottom line is 80.5%, while that for the top line is 78.1%. The proportion of companies beating both EPS and revenue estimates is 64.9%.Biotech companies Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (ALXN  -  Free Report) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (REGN  -  Free Report) are expected to report their Q4 numbers on Feb 8. Let's take a look at which of these biotech companies has an edge over the other ahead of their release.However, before we look at the numbers, let us have a look at the biotech industry.A Glance at the IndustryThe biotech industry is seeing significant pickup in merger and acquisition (M&A) deals of late. The year started off with Celgene (CELG  -  Free Report) announcing plans to acquire Impact Biomedicines. The company revealed plans of acquiring Juno Therapeutics  for approximately $9 billion.The French pharma giant Sanofi (SNY  -  Free Report) also announced of buying biopharma company Bioverativ for $11.6 billion in January 2018. The same month Sanofi also announced plans to acquire the Belgian biotech company, Ablynx for €3.9 billion ($4.8 billion).In the fourth quarter, the biotech sector is well poised. Of the major players in the biotech sector, Biogen (BIIB  -  Free Report) put a mixed show in the reported period with earnings lagging estimates while sales exceeding the same. However, Celgene and Vertex (VRTX  -  Free Report) outpaced both the metrics’ expectations.Alexion New Haven, CT-based Alexion’s blockbuster drug, Soliris, continues to perform well. Alexion continues to identify and treat high number of new patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (“PNH”) and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) with Soliris, across its 50-country operating platform. Alexion is working on expanding Soliris’ label into additional indications. The FDA recently approved the drug for the treatment of refractory gMG in patients who are anti-acetylcholine receptor antibody-positive. The drug was approved in Europe for this indication. Label expansion into additional indications will give Soliris access to a higher patient population and increase the commercial potential of the drug significantly.The company also announced some restructuring initiatives. In this context, Alexion plans to focus on rare diseases businesses in core areas of hematology, nephrology, neurology and metabolic disorders to enhance productivity.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $878 million, marking an increase of 5.5% year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.28 per share, marking an increase of 1.59% year over year.Alexion’s track record is excellent as it has topped estimates in the last four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 11.91%.Alexion has an Earnings ESP of +8.92% as the Most Accurate estimate is $1.40 and the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.28. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. QuoteRegeneron Regeneron’s key growth driver, Eylea, is likely to continue to contribute to the company’s top-line growth. Regeneron is working on expanding Eylea label into additional indications. While a phase III study (PANORAMA) is evaluating Eylea for the treatment of moderately severe to severe non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy in patients without DME, another phase III study (in Japan) is evaluating it for neovascular glaucoma. Label expansion into additional indications will give Eylea access to higher patient population and increase the commercial potential of the drug. Apart from Eylea, investors will remain focused on the uptake of new drugs — Kevzara and Dupixent. The FDA also approved Dupixent (dupilumab) Injection for the treatment of adults with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis.  The initial uptake of the drug is encouraging. The drug was approved in Europe also. The company is also evaluating the drug for treating asthma in adults (LIBERTY ASTHMA QUEST study). Hence, focus will be on the company’s performance, particularly Eylea and Dupixient uptake during the fourth-quarter earnings call. Investors are also expected to await updates on the company’s pipeline.The Earnings ESP, for Regeneron is -1.04%. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $1.50 billion, marking an increase of 22.1% year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earnings is pegged at $4.68 per share, marking an increase of 53.95% year over year.The company’s performance has been mixed so far. In the last four quarters, it surpassed earnings estimates on two occasions and missed in two, with an average positive surprise of 5.96%. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. QuoteOur TakeDuring fourth-quarter 2017, Alexion’s price declined 14.8% compared with Regeneron’s fall of 15.9%. However, Alexion’s Zacks Rank #3, when combined with a positive ESP makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.For Regeneron, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Strong Sell) before going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Therefore, per our proprietary model, we believe that Alexion is poised for better performance in the upcoming quarter.Zacks Top 10 Stocks for 2018 In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest buy-and-hold tickers for the entirety of 2018?Last year's 2017 Zacks Top 10 Stocks portfolio produced double-digit winners, including FMC Corp. and VMware which racked up stellar gains of +67.9% and +61%.

708,VRTX,"In this blog, we highlight two large-cap biotech stocks — Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (VRTX  -  Free Report) and Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (ALXN  -  Free Report) — that attracted investor attention last year and will likely remain in focus in the New Year as well.Both Vertex and Alexion enjoy dominant positions in medical areas - cystic fibrosis (CF) for Vertex and ultra-rare disorders for Alexion – that are not very competitive.  This puts these two companies in advantageous position to peers, which face rising competitive pressure.Vertex Vertex markets two CF drugs, Kalydeco and Orkambi.Year 2017 was a tremendous year for Vertex with positive data read-outs and regulatory approvals leading to an increase in eligible patient population for Kalydeco & Orkambi. With a consistent expansion in patient population, Vertex’s CF product revenues increased through 2017.The company is optimistic that the positive trend in CF sales will continue in 2018 as it gains additional reimbursement approvals for Orkambi in ex-U.S. markets and gets approval to launch tezacaftor (VX-661)/ivacaftor combination medicine.The stock surged 103.4% in 2017, substantially outperforming the 4.4% increase registered by the industry. Estimates have also moved northward in the past 90 days, driven by the company’s positive earnings surprises.Vertex’s CF pipeline is also quite strong with a broad portfolio of next-generation CF correctors. Vertex has also made decent clinical progress across multiple CF studies this year and has meaningful pipeline catalysts. Investor focus is on the triple combination CF regimens, which are crucial for long-term growth, as these have the potential to treat up to 90% of CF patients. Vertex plans to initiate pivotal phase III studies on up to two of the four triple combination regimens in the first half of 2018.AlexionAlexion is focused on the development and commercialization of life-transforming drugs for the treatment of patients with ultra-rare disorders. Its key drug, Soliris, approved for two severe and ultra-rare blood disorders — paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) — has been consistently doing well.Meanwhile, Alexion is working on expanding the drug’s label to include additional indications, which if approved, can boost further sales growth. In October, the FDA approved Soliris to treat refractory generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) who are anti-acetylcholine receptor (AchR) antibody positive.It has two other drugs for rare diseases called Strensiq and Kanuma, which are emerging as growth drivers. Alexion also has a robust pipeline of several candidates under development including Soliris follow-up candidate, ALXN1210. Data from some key studies on ALXN1210 are expected to be presented this year.Though Alexion’s share price declined slightly last year, estimates moved northward in the past 90 days while the company consistently delivered positive earnings surprises.ConclusionWith a strong product portfolio and consistently successful pipeline development, Vertex and Alexion will likely attract investor attention this year in an industry that struggles with increasing pricing and competitive pressure. Also, both the companies are viewed as attractive acquisition targets for larger companies.Both the companies have a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

709,VRTX,"Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN  -  Free Report) got a boost with the EU approving its key revenue driver Soliris for an additional indication. Meanwhile, Biogen (BIIB  -  Free Report) was in the news with an investigation being launched into the rising prices of multiple sclerosis (""MS"") drugs. The investigation has been launched by Rep. Elijah E. Cummings and Rep. Peter Welch with letters being sent to seven companies including Biogen requesting information about their pricing strategies for their MS drugs.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesEU Label Expansion for Alexion’s Soliris: Alexion’s flagship  product, Soliris, gained EU approval for the treatment of patients with refractory generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) making it the first and only complement-based therapy approved in the EU for an ultra-rare subset of gMG. Alexion will launch Soliris for this indication initially in Germany and is evaluating additional EU launches.The gMG indication represents incremental growth opportunity for Soliris and enables the company to enter the neurology therapeutic area. Soliris is currently under review in the U.S. and Japan (response expected early next year) for the gMG indication. With the EU granting approval, it looks like Soliris will gain approval in the U.S. as well where a decision is expected by Oct 23, 2017. According to information provided by the company, about 60,000 – 80,000 people in the U.S. suffer from myasthenia gravis (MG) – Alexion’s targeted population will be approximately 5%-10% of the total MG patient population. Results from a late-stage study (REGAIN) conducted by the company indicate that about 60% of these refractory gMG patients will respond to treatment with Soliris.Soliris is Alexion’s key growth driver with the drug bringing in sales of $1.6 billion in the first half of 2017. The company expects Soliris revenues of $3,075 - $3,125 million in 2017, assuming the identification of a steady number of new patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) across the globe (Also read: Alexion's Soliris' Label Expansion Approved in Europe).Alexion is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock.

According to the letter, four of these drugs have seen at least double-digit price increases since approval while the price of one drug has increased by almost 1,000%. Moreover, Zinbryta, was introduced at a price of $86,592 per annum in 2016 and the price of Biogen’s other four MS drugs were hiked to match Zinbryta’s price by 2017. Biogen will have to respond to the letter by Aug 31, 2017 (Also read: Biogen & 6 Other Multiple Sclerosis Drug Stocks in Focus: Here's Why).Pipeline Setback for Ultragenyx: Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical (RARE  -  Free Report), a company focused on developing treatments for rare and ultra-rare diseases, suffered a pipeline setback with one of its candidates failing in a late-stage study. Aceneuramic acid extended release (Ace-ER) failed to meet the primary as well as key secondary endpoints in a phase III study in patients with GNE myopathy (""GNEM""). Ultragenyx has decided to discontinue the development of Ace-ER.Ultragenyx currently has an investigational treatment under FDA review (vestronidase alpha for MPS 7 with a decision expected by Nov 16, 2017) while it is looking to file for FDA approval of burosumab (for X-linked hypophosphatemia) shortly.   FDA Nod for Ironwood Gout Drug: Ironwood Pharmaceuticals’ (IRWD  -  Free Report) once-daily gout treatment gained FDA approval. Duzallo has been approved for the treatment of hyperuricemia associated with gout in patients who have not achieved target serum uric acid levels with a medically appropriate daily dose of allopurinol alone. This makes Duzallo the first FDA-approved fixed-dose combination treatment available in a single pill for addressing both causes of hyperuricemia in gout - over-production and under-excretion of serum uric acid. Ironwood expects to launch the product in the fourth quarter. Ironwood expects Duzallo to drive sales of its gout franchise which is expected to deliver total annual peak sales of more than $300 million in the U.S. We note that Duzallo’s label includes a boxed warning about acute renal failure (Also read: Ironwood Pharma's Combination Gout Drug Gets FDA Approval).Alkermes Starts Rolling NDA Submission for MDD Drug: Alkermes (ALKS  -  Free Report) has started the rolling submission of a new drug application (NDA) for its investigational major depressive disorder (MDD) drug, ALKS 5461.

710,VRTX,"With earnings season drawing to a close, focus is back on pipeline and regulatory updates. While Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN  -  Free Report), which has several pipeline catalysts lined up for the second half of the year, reported data on one of its late-stage pipeline candidates, Gilead Sciences (GILD  -  Free Report) got priority review for its investigational HIV treatment.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesRegeneron Shelves RSV Antibody on Study Failure: Regeneron’s investigational antibody, suptavumab (REGN2222), for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), failed to meet the primary endpoint in a late-stage study conducted in infants. Regeneron has decided that it will not continue with the development of this candidate. Regeneron has several pipeline catalysts lined up for the second half of the year. Later this quarter, the company expects to report top-line phase III data on Dupixent for asthma – positive data would allow the company to go ahead with a U.S. filing in the fourth quarter. Another important data readout scheduled for the second half of the year is on the company’s PD-1 antibody REGN2810, for cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC), the second most common skin cancer after basal cell carcinoma and the second deadliest skin cancer after melanoma. Meanwhile, Eylea is being evaluated in combination with nesvacumab with top-line data from two phase II studies (wet age-related macular degeneration and diabetic macular edema) expected in the fourth quarter of the year.Regeneron is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock -- you can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Priority Review for Gilead HIV Drug: Gilead gained priority review in the U.S. for its investigational, fixed-dose combination of bictegravir (50mg) (BIC), a novel investigational integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI), and emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (200/25mg) (FTC/TAF), a dual-NRTI backbone, for the treatment of HIV. Gilead had used a Priority Review voucher at the time of filing the regulatory application. With the combination gaining priority review, a response from the FDA should be out by Feb 12, 2018. The combination is under review in the EU as well. Gilead’s HIV franchise is a major contributor to sales with approved drugs like Genvoya, Truvada, Atripla, Stribild, Descovy, Odefsey and Complera bringing in sales of $6.2 billion in the first half of 2017. Gilead’s shares are up 2.1% year to date, lagging the industry’s 7.4% rally (Also read: Gilead NDA for HIV Combo Regimen Gets Priority Review).Another Late-Stage Failure for Ophthotech Eye Drug: Ophthotech (OPHT  -  Free Report), which is focused on the development of treatments for eye diseases, announced that Fovista failed to meet the primary endpoint in another late-stage study. The superiority study was evaluating Fovista anti-PDGF therapy in combination with Eylea (aflibercept) or Avastin (bevacizumab) anti-VEGF therapy compared to Eylea or Avastin monotherapy for the treatment of wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD). The study failed to achieve the primary endpoint. The company had anyway attributed a low likelihood of success to the study given Fovista's earlier failure in two phase III studies as well as the failure of a mid-stage study conducted by a competitor on a PDGF inhibitor and a VEGF inhibitor combination for AMD.Ionis Retains Full Rights to Inotersen and IONIS-FB-LRx: Ionis Pharmaceuticals (IONS  -  Free Report) said that Glaxo has declined its options for two drugs, inotersen and IONIS-FB-LRx, in keeping with its decision to reprioritize its pipeline and review its Rare Diseases business. The company, however, will continue to collaborate with Ionis for IONIS-HBVRx and IONIS-HBV-LRx, which are being evaluated for hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection.With Ionis retaining rights to these two investigational drugs, the company laid out its plans and said that it will be filing for approval of inotersen in 2017 followed by launch in 2018. The initial indication for inotersen, which has been designed to treat patients with TTR amyloidosis (ATTR), is expected to be for the treatment of patients with polyneuropathy due to hereditary TTR amyloidosis (hATTR-PN).Ionis said that it is considering setting up a commercial subsidiary to commercialize or co-commercialize inotersen in North America. The company is evaluating other options as well including a partnership deal.Meanwhile, IONIS-FB-LRx is slated to move into a mid-stage study in patients with dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD) later this year (Also read: Ionis Pharmaceuticals Retains Rights to Inotersen, Stock Up).Galapagos Up on IPF Data: Galapagos NV’s (GLPG  -  Free Report) shares were up 10.8% on positive data from a mid-stage study on the company’s investigational idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) drug. GLPG1690 halted disease progression in IPF patients in the study and is the first autotaxin inhibitor to show effect in an IPF study. Galapagos now intends to move the candidate into a late-stage study and is already in discussions with regulators regarding the study design.Galapagos’s data comes shortly after FibroGen’s investigational IPF drug, pamrevlumab, fared well in a mid-stage study as well as two combination safety sub-studies. Pamrevlumab is an anti-connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) antibody.The IPF market represents huge commercial potential – IPF or abnormal scarring of the lungs is a rare and serious lung disease with survival rates comparable to those of some of the deadliest cancers.

The advisory panel, which had voted 12 to 1 in favor of the safety data for Heplisav-B, had commented on the design of Dynavax's proposed post-marketing study. Based on this, the company and the FDA agreed that more time is needed to finalize key details of the post-marketing study. As a result, the FDA action date was pushed back by three months to Nov 10, 2017. The company still expects to launch Heplisav-B in the U.S. in early 2018. Dynavax’s shares are up a whopping 372.2% year to date, significantly outperforming the industry’s 9.7% rally.AbbVie’s New HCV Treatment Gets FDA Nod: AbbVie’s 8-week, pan-genotypic, ribavirin-free, once-daily hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment, Mavyret, gained FDA approval for use in HCV patients without cirrhosis and who are new to treatment. With this approval, competition in the HCV market is going to heat up further. According to AbbVie, Mavyret may be used in up to 95% of HCV patients, depending on the stage of liver disease and prior treatment history. The company said that about 3.4 million Americans are chronically infected with HCV. Mavyret gained EU approval recently.FibroGen Hits 52-Week High on IPF Drug Data: FibroGen’s (FGEN  -  Free Report) shares shot up 48.2% on positive data on the company’s investigational idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) drug, pamrevlumab, from a mid-stage study as well as two combination safety sub-studies. The proprietary, first-in-class, anti-connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) antibody is being evaluated in fibrotic disease and cancer. The IPF indication represents huge commercial potential – IPF or abnormal scarring of the lungs is a rare and serious lung disease with survival rates comparable to those of some of the deadliest cancers. If approved, pamrevlumab could bring in significant sales for FibroGen. Currently approved IPF drugs include Esbriet and Ofev (Read more: Why Did FibroGen Stock Hit All-Time High Today?).PerformanceMedical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % Return Medical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % ReturnThe NASDAQ Biotechnology Index declined 0.5% over the last five trading sessions.

712,VRTX,"After weeks of shaky trading, the Wall Street continued its second-largest bull run, dodging the list of woes including geopolitical tension, Washington turmoil, elevated valuations, the aftermath of hurricanes Harvey & Irma as well as rounds of downbeat economic data.In particular, the S&P 500 is in the spotlight, with the index breaching the 2,500 milestone for the first time, bringing its year-to-date gains to nearly 12%. According to Bloomberg, this rally overtook the 266% increase in the index during the 1949-56 bull run and added almost $20 trillion to the value of American equities. The journey of 100 points came in less than four months, suggesting strong complacency in the stock market.Renewed hopes for Trump’s tax reform by the end of the year is the main catalyst in driving the stock market to new highs. Additionally, steady economic fundamentals and strong corporate earnings added to the strength. The upward trend is likely to continue in the months ahead (read: ETF Asset Report: U.S. Equities Rule).Given the enthusiasm, investors are flocking to its ETF, iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV  -  Free Report). Let’s take a closer look at the fundamentals of IVV and its performance.IVV in FocusIVV is the top asset creator this year pulling in nearly $24.1 billion in capital. It tracks the S&P 500 Index and holds 505 stocks in its basket, with each security holding no more than 3.85% of total assets. This suggests a nice balance across each security and prevents heavy concentration. However, the product is slightly tilted toward information technology sector with 23.1% share while health care, financials, consumer discretionary and industrials account for a double-digit exposure each. The ETF is the low cost choice in the space, charging 4 bps in fees per year from investors and trades in solid volume of 3.4 million shares a day on average.The fund has gained 13.1% in the year-to-date time frame and has a Zacks ETF Rank #2 (Buy) with a Medium risk outlook.

(NRG  -  Free Report): The stock has gained about 87% in the year-to-date time frame.

713,VRTX,"There were quite a few major developments this week with Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN  -  Free Report) announcing a restructuring plan that will see the company cutting jobs and streamlining operations. Meanwhile, data was presented by companies like Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN  -  Free Report), AbbVie (ABBV  -  Free Report) and Kura Oncology (KURA  -  Free Report) among others.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesAlexion to Cut Jobs, Shift Headquarters: Alexion announced a restructuring plan which will see the company cutting down its global workforce by 20%, closing down several sites (including the Rhode Island manufacturing facility and certain regional and country-based offices) and shifting its headquarters to Boston (by mid-2018). With these efforts, the company expects to generate annual pre-tax savings of about $250 million by 2019. Savings will be used for growth opportunities and optimization.

While overall results were good, less activity was observed in patients with lower eosinophilic cells. Regeneron and Sanofi intend to file for FDA approval by year end. The asthma market is huge with about one million people in the United States living with uncontrolled, persistent asthma despite being treated with standard therapies. Dupixent, which has blockbuster potential, is currently approved for eczema and is being evaluated for additional indications like pediatric atopic dermatitis, nasal polyps and eosinophilic esophagitis (Read more: Regeneron/Sanofi's Dupixent Asthma Study Meets Endpoints).AbbVie’s Upadacitinib Positive in Studies: AbbVie came out with positive data with the company saying that its experimental oral JAK1-selective inhibitor, upadacitinib (ABT-494), met all primary and ranked secondary endpoints in a late-stage study for moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis (Read more: AbbVie's RA Candidate Meets Primary Endpoint in Phase III).

Upadacitinib is being evaluated for additional indications including psoriatic arthritis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and ankylosing spondylitis.Intercept Hit by “Dear Doctor” Letter: Intercept Pharmaceuticals’s (ICPT  -  Free Report) shares were down on a “Dear Doctor” letter issued by the company related to the use of its sole marketed product, Ocaliva. The letter lays emphasis on the use of the recommended dosage on the label as liver injury, liver decompensation, liver failure, and death were reported when Ocaliva was dosed more frequently than recommended. Ocaliva, approved in May 2016 for primary biliary cholangitis (“PBC”) in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B and C), brought in sales of $30.4 million in the second quarter of 2017. While Intercept’s shares were down 16.1%, the company said on a recent call that it does not expect any label changes or a boxed warning.Sage Drug Disappoints in Late-Stage Study: Sage Therapeutics’s (SAGE  -  Free Report) shares were down 13.7% on disappointing top-line data from a late-stage study on brexanolone (SAGE-547) for treatment super-refractory status epilepticus (“SRSE”). The study failed to meet the primary endpoint. Brexanolone is currently in late-stage development for the treatment of postpartum depression (“PPD”).Kura Soars on Promising Cancer Study Data: Kura’s shares jumped more than 70% on positive topline results from a mid-stage study on its lead pipeline candidate, tipifarnib, in patients with HRAS mutant relapsed or refractory squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck (“HNSCC”). The primary endpoint was achieved before the completion of enrollment.PerformanceMedical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % Return Medical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % ReturnThe Nasdaq Biotechnology Index gained 0.6% over the last five trading sessions.

714,VRTX,"The biotech sector is going through the roof right now with SPDR S&P Biotech ETF (XBI  -  Free Report) adding over 9% in a month (as of Sep 11, 2017). Plenty of factors are powering the sector. Among these, breakthrough U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approvals, success in the immune-oncology field, and mergers and acquisitions are at the forefront.Biotech stock Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX  -  Free Report) received a new FDA approval for cystic fibrosis drug, Kalydeco. In early September, FDA approved “Novartis AG' breakthrough gene transfer treatment, Kymriah (tisagenlecleucel) suspension for the treatment of patients up to 25 years of age with B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia that is refractory or in second or later relapse,” as per the source.Investors should note that CAR-T is a fresh immunocellular therapy and many companies are eyeing it. In fact, Gilead Sciences GILD announced the buyout of Kite Pharma KITE for $11.9 billion in late August (read: Biotech ETFs Soar on Gilead-Kite Deal). Kite Pharma is expected to receive approval for its CAR-T therapy axicabtagene ciloleucel (axi-cel) shortly. With this acquisition, Gilead will step into the new arena of oncology treatment, known as CAR-T, which targets the body’s own immune system to fight tumors.Two months ago, Clovis Oncology CLVS shares also skyrocketed following the company’s positive cancer drug data. The company then said that clinical trial data on its ovarian cancer drug treatment indicated that it may substantially help more patients than expected (read: 4 Stocks & ETFs to Buy on Clovis' Positive Drug Data).If this was not enough, Teva Pharmaceutical TEVA shares surged over 19% on Sep 11 as it appointed a former Novo Nordisk (NVO) as CEO. The new recruitment followed Teva’s last full-time CEO’s seven-month term and resignation amid a bribery scandal.Compelling Valuation Biotech stocks were the most hurt among the S&P 500 members last year. This has probably made the space cheap and helped it to be back with a bang. Biotech ETF XBI added about 17.7% in the last three months (as of Sep 11, 2017) while SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY  -  Free Report) was up 2.9%. The fund XBI has a relative strength index of 66.95. This means that the fund is yet to enter the overbought territory.Also, fears over price gouging are ebbing substantially in the Trump administration.

715,VRTX,"It was a relatively slow week for the biotech sector though key pipeline updates were provided by companies like Cellectis (CLLS  -  Free Report) and Insmed (INSM  -  Free Report). While Insmed skyrocketed on positive data on its lead pipeline candidate, Cellectis was hit by a clinical hold on a couple of phase I studies.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesCellectis Hit by FDA Clinical Hold: Cellectis’ shares were hit by a clinical hold placed by the FDA on a couple of early-stage studies being conducted on UCART123. While one study is for acute myeloid leukemia (""AML""), the other is for blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN). The hold came into place after the company reported a death in the BPDCN study.Cellectis, which is focused on developing immunotherapies based on gene-edited allogeneic CAR T-cells (UCART), said that it is working with the FDA and investigators for the resumption of the studies with an amended protocol including a lower dosage. Although shares were down 20.3% on the clinical hold, Cellectis has gained 51.4% year to date, significantly outperforming the industry’s 15.9% rally.Insmed Shoots Up on ALIS Data: Insmed’s shares shot up 119.6% on positive top-line data from a late-stage study (CONVERT) for treatment-refractory nontuberculous mycobacterial (“NTM”) lung disease caused by mycobacterium avium complex (""MAC""). Results showed that the addition of ALIS (amikacin liposome inhalation suspension) to guideline-based therapy (""GBT"") eliminated evidence of NTM lung disease caused by MAC in sputum by the sixth month in 29% of patients, compared to 9% of patients on GBT alone.Based on this data, Insmed intends to seek accelerated approval and priority review of ALIS under subpart H. ALIS has breakthrough therapy designation and fast track status in the United States and is also a qualified infectious disease product (""QIDP"") under the Generating Antibiotic Incentives Now (""GAIN"") Act, which will provide it with an additional five years of exclusivity.ALIS is the lead candidate in Insmed’s pipeline. According to the company, about 75,000 - 105,000 patients will be diagnosed with NTM lung disease in 2018, of which 40,000 - 50,000 will be treated for NTM lung disease caused by MAC.Akcea/Ionis Submit FCS Drug for FDA Approval: Akcea Therapeutics (AKCA  -  Free Report) and Ionis Pharmaceuticals (IONS  -  Free Report) announced the submission of a New Drug Application (“NDA”) for volanesorsen for the treatment of familial chylomicronemia syndrome (“FCS”), a severe, rare disorder characterized by extremely high levels of triglycerides. The company is looking to launch volanesorsen globally in 2018 provided it gains timely approval. While the efficacy data on volanesorsen is promising, concerns remain about the safety profile of the candidate given injection site reactions and the fall in platelet count.Volanesorsen is currently being evaluated in a late-stage study for familial partial lipodystrophy (""FPL"") with topline data expected in 2019.Ligand Diabetes Drug Fares Well in Mid-Stage Study: Ligand Pharmaceuticals (LGND  -  Free Report) announced positive top-line results from a mid-stage study on its investigational type II diabetes treatment, LGD-6972, an oral, small molecule, glucagon receptor antagonist (""GRA""). In addition to showing robust, statistically significant, dose-dependent reductions from baseline in hemoglobin A1c after 12 weeks of treatment, LGD-6972 was found to be safe and well tolerated. Although there are several diabetes treatments available in the market, there remains significant need for additional treatments considering diabetes is a growing global epidemic affecting millions across the world. Ligand is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock.

Approval was largely expected as the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (“CHMP”) of the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) had adopted a positive opinion for the pediatric formulation earlier this year in June (Also read: Amgen Gets EU Nod to Expand Hyperparathyroidism Drug Label).PerformanceMedical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % Return Medical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % ReturnThe NASDAQ Biotechnology Index gained 2.8% over the last three trading sessions.

716,VRTX,"The second-quarter reporting cycle has almost ended with only nine S&P 500 stocks left to report as of Aug 25, 2017. All the sectors, excluding Auto and Conglomerates, have recorded earnings growth in the quarter. Total earnings increased 11.2% in the second quarter on the back of 5.6% revenue growth from the year-ago period.The pharma and biotech sector has performed well in the first half. The sector was in turmoil in 2016 due to the drug pricing controversy brought forward by presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton in her campaign. However, defying all odds and uncertainties surrounding Obamacare, the sector has turned around this year. Although drug pricing risk still persists, investors are seemingly comfortable with the scenario and are focused on the fundamentals.The NYSE ARCA Pharmaceutical Index has risen almost 10% year to date (YTD) after declining almost 10% last year. The NASDAQ Biotechnology Index is up 25.9% YTD after sliding 19.1% in 2016.In fact, the Zacks Drugs sector is up 9.6% YTD. However, the S&P 500 has risen 10.6% in the period.Impressive 1H & Rising ApprovalsThe Medical sector had recorded earnings growth of 5.7% on revenue growth of 5.8% in the first quarter. In the second quarter, with 98.2% of companies having reported so far, earnings have grown 6.7% on revenue growth of 4.2%. A look at the beat ratio shows earnings beat of 83.3% and revenue beat of 64.8% in the second quarter.Within the sector, biotech stocks performed particularly well as most of the key players beat earnings and revenue expectations. A few companies in the sub sector have also raised their outlook for 2017. Sales of new drugs were also impressive, which is expected to offset the impact of genericization of key drugs to an extent. Moreover, pipeline candidates have progressed well as evident from the positive results announced in the first half. The companies are also focusing on newer categories like gene editing, NASH and Parkinson's disease.Based on the present trend, 2017 is expected to see far more approvals than 2016. The agency has already approved a total of 31 drugs so far this year compared to 22 for the whole of 2016.Meanwhile, tax reforms and cash repatriation policies should give pharma/biotech companies more cash flexibility to pursue acquisitions/deals.However, with many companies fighting to bring their therapies to the market, competition is intensifying. Loss of exclusivity for certain key drugs, high profile pipeline setback and drug pricing issue still remains a concern for the sector.Nonetheless, the rest of 2017 is expected to be eventful with quite a few companies expected to announce data on their pipeline candidates being developed across a wide range of therapeutics areas. We note that the first half was rather quiet in terms of mergers & acquisitions and collaborations/deals. However, there are chances that it will pick up in the second half, beginning with Gilead’s acquisition of Kite Pharma for almost $12 billion.Stocks in FocusGiven this favorable scenario, many biotech stocks have shown an impressive run in 2017. Here are four biotech companies whose share price has more than doubled so far this year.Puma Biotechnology, Inc. (PBYI  -  Free Report)Los Angeles, CA-based Puma’s first marketed drug, neratinib was approved by the FDA for the treatment of advanced breast cancer in July 2017 and subsequently launched in August under the brand name, Nerlynx. The drug is under review in the EU with a response expected in early 2018. Nerlynx FDA approval was a major boost for Puma given the immense commercial potential in the target market.Shares of Pumahave surged 206.7% so far this year, outperforming the gain of 15.4% for the industry.The company has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (ALNY  -  Free Report)This Cambridge, MA-based company has made major progress in its pipeline during the first half. In July, Alnylam advanced its hemophilia candidate, fitusiran, to phase III study. Patisiran demonstrated potential to halt or improve neuropathy progression in patients with hATTR amyloidosis in a phase II study. Data from a phase III study is expected this year with a new drug application expected to be filed by year end.Givosiran, developed for acute hepatic porphyrias, in June 2017 showed potential in preventing porphyria attacks in patients with acute intermittent porphyria (AIP) suffering recurrent attacks in a phase I study. The company expects to initiate a phase III study by year end.The company’s shares are up 120.4% so far this year, significantly outperforming the industry’s gain of 15.3%.Alnylam carries a Zacks Rank #3.Kite Pharma, Inc. The company’s shares are up 296.8% so far this year, significantly outperforming the industry’s gain of 15.3%. Its CAR-T therapy axicabtagene ciloleucel is nearing approval.However, Kite Pharma, has agreed to be acquired by Gilead for approximately $11.9 billion. The deal, which is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2017, also gave a major push to the share priceAxicabtagene ciloleucel, for treating aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), is under priority review in the U.S. A decision from the FDA is expected on Nov 29. We believe the solid efficacy profile demonstrated by the pivotal ZUMA-1 study of axicabtagene ciloleucel is likely to support the drug’s approval this year. In Europe, a regulatory application was filed in July 2017 with approval and launch expected next year.Kite Pharma carries a Zacks Rank #3.Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc. (VRTX  -  Free Report)Shares of this Boston, MA-based company have increased 107.5% so far this year compared with the industry’s gain of 15.3%.Vertex’s two CF drugs - Kalydeco & Orkambi - have performed well with combined sales increasing almost 21.5% year over year.Its CF pipeline is quite strong with a broad portfolio of next-generation CF correctors.The company is evaluating some next-generation CFTR correctors (VX-152, VX-440, VX-659 and VX-445) as part of a triple combination withtezacaftorand Kalydeco.Data from VX-152 and VX-440 phase II and VX-659 phase I triple combination studies were presented in July 2017. The data demonstrated that all three combinations led to pronounced improvement in lung function. In fact, these are the first data to show the potential to treat the underlying cause of CF in patients who have a severe and difficult-to-treat type of the disease.Following discussions with regulatory agencies, Vertex will initiate pivotal phase III studies on one or two of the four triple combination regimens in the first half of 2018.If the triple-combo regimes are successful, Vertex can address a significantly larger CF patient population– almost 90% of patients with CF - in the future.Vertex carries a Zacks Rank #3.Where Do Zacks' Investment Ideas Come From?You are welcome to download the full, up-to-the-minute list of 220 Zacks Rank #1 ""Strong Buy"" stocks free of charge.

717,VRTX,"Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (VRTX  -  Free Report) may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Vertex Pharmaceuticals is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for VRTX in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at 39 cents per share for VRTX, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of 37 cents per share.

718,VRTX,"Celgene Corporation (CELG  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 26, before the opening bell. Celgene’s stock has moved up 6.1% year to date compared with the industry’s gain of 11.8%.Celgene has an excellent track record with the company beating earnings estimates in the last four trailing quarters. Last quarter, the company beat expectations by 2.8%. Overall, the company has delivered an average positive surprise of 3.8%. We expect the company to beat estimates once again on the back of strong performance of key drug Revlimid.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Celgene is likely to beat on earnings estimates this quarter. This is because it has the right combination of two key ingredients, a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold).Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is +0.08%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Celgene currently carries a Zacks Rank #3. The combination of Zacks Rank #3 and a positive ESP makes us confident of an earnings beat.Conversely, Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Celgene Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Celgene Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Celgene Corporation QuoteRevlimid to Drive GrowthConcurrent with the second-quarter earnings results, Celgene raised its guidance for 2017. The company anticipates earnings in the range of $7.25-$7.35 per share compared with the previous guidance of $7.15-$7.30 per share. Net product sales are projected at $13-13.4 billion.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for product sales in the third quarter currently stands at $3.4 billion.Revlimid, an oral immunomodulatory drug, is currently approved for several indications including MM, myelodysplastic syndromes and mantle cell lymphoma. The drug performed well in the first half and combated the challenges of uneven buying patterns and coverage gap. Market share gains in key markets and longer treatment duration are contributing to the drug’s growth.Meanwhile, Celgene is working on expanding Revlimid’s label further. Revlimid received the FDA’s approval for use as a maintenance treatment in NDMM patients after they receive an autologous stem-cell transplant. NDMM market share continues to grow outside the United States, with a positive uptake both in the EU and Japan.Continued momentum in the core indication, label expansion and global launches should help the product to keep contributing to the top line. The Zacks Consensus estimate for Revlimid currently stands at $2.1 billion for the third quarter.Other key products — Pomalyst/Imnovid, Abraxane and Otezla — continue to perform well. Pomalyst/Imnovid is being evaluated in multiple combination studies in relapsed/refractory MM. The drug’s label was updated in the United States and the Europe to include data from a pooled pharmacokinetics analysis of patients with relapsed and/or refractory MM and impaired renal function.  Pomalyst, in combination with Darzalex and dexamethasone for relapsed/refractory myeloma was approved in the United States and should propel sales further.The approval of Idhifa for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory AML (R/R AML) will further boost Celgene’s portfolio. The drug was developed in collaboration with Agios Pharmaceuticals (AGIO  -  Free Report). Otezla achieved the blockbuster status in 2016 driven by solid demand in the United States and trend is expected to continue in 2017. Increased contribution from European countries also impacted sales positively. It is currently being evaluated in phase III studies for Behçet's disease, atopic dermatitis and expanded indications in psoriatic arthritis and plaque psoriasis.The company is keen to expand its oncology franchise beyond Abraxane. Label and geographical expansion of approved drugs in additional indications will increase their commercial potential further. Abraxane sales are estimated to be around $1 billion. While Pomalyst’s revenues are projected around $1.6 billion, the same for Otezla are estimated around $1.5-1.7 billion.During third-quarter earnings call investors are expected to remain focused on the company’s performance and label expansion efforts, along with updates on the pipeline front.Other Stocks Poised to Beat EstimatesHere are some other health care stocks that you may want to consider, as our model shows that they too have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc.

719,VRTX,"A leader in the hepatitis C virus (HCV) space, Gilead Sciences Inc. (GILD  -  Free Report), is expected to beat expectations when it reports third-quarter results on Oct 26, after the market closes.Gilead’s track record is pretty mixed, with the company beating estimates in two of the last four and missing in one two. Last quarter, the company beat expectations by 17.4%. Overall, the company recorded an average positive earnings surprise of 6.4%.  Gilead’s stock has gained 15.9% year to date against the industry's 11.7%. A strong performance in the third quarter will boost share price performance further.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Gilead is likely to beat on earnings estimates this quarter. This is because it has the right combination of two key ingredients, a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold).Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is +0.23%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is $2.09 while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged a penny lower at $2.08. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Gilead currently carries a Zacks Rank #3. The combination of Zacks Rank #3 and a positive ESP makes us confident of an earnings beat.Conversely, Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Gilead Sciences, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Gilead Sciences, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Gilead Sciences, Inc. Quote Factors at PlayConcurrent with the second-quarter earnings call, Gilead updated its annual guidance. Based on a better-than-expected performance in the first half of 2017 specifically in the United States, the company raised its guidance for 2017.  Gilead now expects net product sales in the range of $24.0-$25.5 billion, up from $22.5-$24.5 billion provided earlier. Non-HCV product sales are projected between $15.5 and $16.0 billion (earlier projection: $15 million and $15.5 billion). HCV product sales are projected between $8.5 billion and $9.5 billion (earlier projection: $7.5 billion and $9.0 billion). Adjusted R&D expenses and adjusted SG&A expenses are now projected in the range of $3.2-$3.4 billion and $3.2-$3.4 billion, respectively. Adjusted product gross margin is expected in the range of 86-88%. Earnings per share are now projected around 86-93 cents (earlier projection: 84-91 cents).Strong HIV performance and other antiviral product sales are being driven by continued uptake of tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) based products — Genvoya, Descovy and Odefsey. We expect the trend to continue in the third quarter as well. Genvoya has already become the most prescribed regimen for both treatment-naïve and switch patients since its launch. This should drive the non-HCV product sales.  The TAF-based regimens now represent 51% of total Gilead HIV prescription volume following the launch of Genvoya and Odefsey and Descovy in 2016.  Specifically, Genvoya is now the company’s bestselling HIV product with a treatment-naïve patient share of 41%. The Zacks Consensus estimate for Genvoya stands at $923 million. Strong uptake for Truvada for use in the pre-exposure prophylaxis setting is also expected to boost sales.  However, Gilead will lose exclusivity for Viread in 2017 in some countries outside the United States which might impact sales.Meanwhile, the HCV franchise continues to be under competitive and pricing pressure leading to a massive decline in Harvoni and Sovaldi sales. Harvoni and Sovaldi has been facing competition from AbbVie Inc.’s (ABBV  -  Free Report) Viekira Pak and Viekira XR among others. Higher discounts and payer mix continue to impact sales adversely. Despite this, the company increased its guidance for HCV franchise.  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for lead HCV drug Sovaldi and Harvoni currently stand at $24.6 million and $1.0 million for the third quarter. The HCV portfolio received a major boost when Epclusa gained approval in 2016. The FDA also approved Vosevi tablets as a single-tablet regimen (STR) for the re-treatment of chronic HCV infection in adults.On the other hand, we expect the company to increase its guidance further for the incremental contribution from the recent Kite Pharma acquisition. The FDA recently approved its chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy, Yescarta (axicabtagene ciloleucel), for the treatment of refractory aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma, which includes DLBCL, transformed follicular lymphoma and primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma.  We expect the management to throw more light on the same during the third-quarter’s call. Investors are also likely to keep an eye on other pipeline updates.Other Stocks Poised to Beat EstimatesHere are some other health care stocks that you may want to consider, as our model shows that they too have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (VRTX  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +7.24% and a Zacks Rank #2.

720,VRTX,"Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (VRTX  -  Free Report) reported fourth-quarter 2017 earnings per share of 61 cents, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 58 cents and came ahead of the year-ago earnings of 35 cents. Strong product revenues led to higher profits in the quarter and lower operating expense ratio year over year.Vertex reported revenues of $651.6 million in the fourth quarter, up almost 42% year over year driven by strong product revenues. Revenues also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $596.13 million.Fourth Quarter Sales StrongVertex’s fourth-quarter revenues consisted of sales from cystic fibrosis (“CF”) products — Kalydeco and Orkambi, collaborative ($29.1 million) and royalty revenues ($1.3 million). CF product revenues were $621.2 million in the fourth quarter, up 37% year over year.Kalydeco sales surged 44% to $256 million following approvals to treat an expanded population.In May 2017, Kalydeco was approved for use in CF patients 2 years and older who have one of 23 residual function mutations in the CFTR gene. In August 2017, Kalydeco was approved in CF patients (2 years and older) who have one of five residual function mutations that result in a splicing defect in the CFTR gene. These line-extensions increased the eligible patient population for Kalydeco.Orkambi (lumacaftor/ivacaftor) delivered sales of $365 million, up 32% year over year. The growth was supported by continued uptake globally, especially in pediatric patients in the United States.Costs RiseAdjusted research and development (R&D) expenses increased 20.3% to $249.2 million in the fourth quarter due to higher costs related to development of triple combination CF regimens. Adjusted selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased 20% to $105.5 million.2017 ResultsVertex’s full-year revenues increased 46.2% year over year to $2.49 billion mainly driven by upfront payment of $315.2 million earned from Germany-based Merck KGaA  and strong CF portfolio sales. The upfront payment was part of a collaboration agreement per which Vertex out-licensed four oncology programs to Merck KGaA. Adjusted earnings for 2017 were up 129% year over year to $1.95 per share.Adjusted R&D expenses increased 10.8% year over year to $1.33 billion. However, it excluded an upfront payment of $160 million related to acquisition of a CFTR potentiator, VX-561, from Concert Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (CNCE  -  Free Report). Adjusted SG&A expenses increased 9% year over year to $375.3 million, which included costs related to the potential launch of tezacaftor/ivacaftor combination in the United States. The increase was also due to increased investment to support the global commercialization of Orkambi and Kalydeco.Stock Repurchase ProgramConcurrent with the earnings release, Vertex announced that the board has authorized a share repurchase program to buy back its common stock to the tune of $500 million in 2018 and 2019.2018 GuidanceVertex provided 2018 guidance for combined operating costs.Combined adjusted research and development (R&D) and selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses in 2018 are anticipated in the range of $1.50 to $1.55 billion.The increase in operating expense reflects anticipated costs related to development and commercialization of triple combinations for treating CF and planned launch of tezacaftor/ivacaftor combination.Pipeline & Regulatory UpdatesIn December 2017, Vertex announced data from phase III study – ARRIVAL – evaluating Kalydeco in children (age 1-2 years)who have one of 10 mutations in the CFTR gene. It showed improvement across multiple endpoints, including measures of pancreatic function. Based on this data, Vertex plans to file regulatory applications for approval of Kalydeco in children aged one to two years in the first quarter of 2018.In January 2018, the European Commission approved a line extension for Orkambi to include use in children with CF aged between six and 11 years and have two copies of the F508del mutation. The approval increases the targeted patient population by about 3,400 patients. The company has plans to file regulatory applications for approval of Orkambi in children aged two to five with CF who have two copies of the F508del mutation in the first quarter of 2018.Vertex is also seeking approval for a combination of tezacaftor and Kalydeco (ivacaftor) in CF patients aged 12 and older who have two copies of the F508del mutation or who have at least one residual function mutation. Regulatory applications are under review in the United States and Europe. A decision is expected in the United States on Feb 28, 2018 and in Europe in the second half of 2018.The company is also developing triple combination regimens for treating CF, which are capable of treating almost 90% of patients. Vertex has selected two out of four next-generation correctors – VX-659 and VX-445 – for advancing into two separate phase III triple combination studies. The candidates will evaluated in combination with tezacaftor and Kalydeco.Apart from CF, Vertex is also developing treatments for sickle cell disease, thalassemia, influenza and pain management. During the fourth quarter, the company initiated a phase III study on pimodivir in combination with standard-of-care treatment in patients with influenza. This study is being conducted in collaboration with Janssen Pharmaceuticals, a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report).Our TakeVertex’s fourth-quarter results reflect strong performance of the CF products. The company beat estimates on both counts as sales of its CF drugs rose.Shares rose over 6% in after-hours trading in response to the strong quarterly results. In the past year, Vertex’s share price has increased a massive 100.9%, comparing favorably with an increase of 6.8% for the industry.Vertex’s CF pipeline is quite strong with a broad portfolio of next-generation CF correctors. Its triple combination CF regimens are considered crucial for long-term growth. If the triple-combo regimes are successful, Vertex can address a significantly larger CF patient population — almost 90% of the patients — in the future. However, competition is increasing as several major companies are expressing interest in CF.Vertex carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The announcement comes just a few weeks after Novo Nordisk had announced its interest in acquiring Ablynx in a deal valued at approximately €2.6 billion. Ablynx had rejected Novo Nordisk’s offer with the company’s Board saying that the proposal fundamentally undervalued Ablynx and its growth prospects.A look at Ablynx’s pipeline shows that the company could well be in a position to launch its first product, caplacizumab (anti-vWF; acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura - aTTP), this year. Caplacizumab is currently under review in the EU while a regulatory application will be filed in the United States in the first half of 2018. The estimated annual market opportunity for aTTP, a life-threatening blood clotting disease, is expected to be about €1.2 billion. The company also has a broad range of partnerships with the potential to generate more than €10.6 billion in milestones plus royalties. Other pipeline candidates also address significant market opportunities. The company has more than 45 programs in its pipeline and eight Nanobodies in clinical development. The acquisition is expected to close by the end of the second quarter of 2018 (Read more: Sanofi on a Buyout Spree This Month, to Buy Ablynx for $4.8B).Bellicum Down on FDA Clinical Hold: Bellicum Pharmaceuticals’s shares are down almost 30% following the company’s announcement that the FDA has placed a clinical hold on U.S. studies being conducted on BPX-501. The hold was placed after three cases of encephalopathy were deemed as possibly connected to BPX-501. The company said that the cases were complex with certain factors like prior failed transplants, prior history of immunodeficiency, concurrent infection, and administration of rimiducid in combination with other medications.Bellicum is now waiting to receive a formal notice from the FDA as to the steps needed to be taken for the resumption of the studies. The clinical hold will not impact an ongoing registration study in Europe.Seattle Genetics to Boost Pipeline with Cascadian Acquisition: Seattle Genetics announced that it will be acquiring Cascadian Therapeutics for $10 per share in cash, or about $614 million. With this acquisition, slated to close in the first quarter of 2018, Seattle will be adding tucatinib to its pipeline. Tucatinib is an investigational oral, small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor (“TKI”) that is highly selective for HER2, a growth factor receptor that is overexpressed in several cancers, including breast, colorectal, ovarian and gastric. The candidate is currently in a pivotal phase II program for HER2+ metastatic breast cancer and complements Seattle’s existing pipeline.PerformanceMedical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % Return Medical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % ReturnThe Nasdaq Biotechnology Index declined 1.5% over the last five trading sessions.

722,VRTX,"Last week, we issued an article where we mentioned that mergers and acquisitions, which were quite lean in 2017, may pick up significantly in 2018 if the proposed tax reforms are finally approved.The reforms aim to cut the corporate tax rate from 35% to 20%, which can boost profits of large drug/biotech companies. The change in tax code will also allow companies to bring back huge cash held overseas at a one-time tax rate of 10%.These changes will definitely leave more cash in the hands of drug/biotech companies. Also, with focus on drug pricing taking a backseat and large drug/biotech companies struggling with organic growth, there is a lot of chatter about a possible increase in large M&As in 2018.Given that it takes several years and millions of dollars to develop new therapeutics from scratch, large pharmaceutical companies sitting on huge piles of cash may prefer to buy innovative small/mid cap biotech companies to build out their pipelines.In this article, we discuss some mid- and large-cap names that may be logical acquisition targets next year for companies like Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report), Merck (MRK  -  Free Report), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) and others. What matters for buying a drug/biotech stock is the current sales performance of its drugs/products, prospects of future sales growth, and the quality of the pipeline.The four companies we discuss have most of these factors going in their favor. Acquisitions of small-cap drug/biotech companies are very difficult to predict and quite frequent. Hence, these have been excluded from the discussion.BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. (BMRN  -  Free Report)Companies whose product/pipeline portfolio includes rare disease drugs are in great demand as it is a less competitive space and the expensive treatments can bring in huge profits. BioMarin is one such drug developer. Its market cap is around $14 billion.BioMarin’s key orphan disease drugs – Vimizim and Kuvan – continue to do well, backed by strong underlying patient demand trends. BioMarin expects sustained growth in both the drugs. Brineura’s earlier-than-expected approval this year for the treatment of children with CLN2 disease, a form of Batten disease, was also a huge boost for BioMarin.Its impressive rare disease pipeline is also progressing well with approval for pegvaliase for the treatment of phenylketonuria expected in 2018. On the pipeline, we believe both late-stage candidates – vosoritide - for achondroplasia, the most common form of dwarfism, and BMN27 – for hemophilia A -  have blockbuster potential.BioMarin has already been the target of takeover speculation. Companies like Gilead (GILD), Amgen (AMGN) and Roche may be interested in buying BioMarin.Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (VRTX  -  Free Report)For Vertex, 2017 so far has been a tremendous year with positive data read-outs and regulatory approvals leading to an increase in eligible patient population for its two approved cystic fibrosis (CF) - Kalydeco & Orkambi. CF is Vertex’s main area of focus. With a consistent expansion in patient population, Vertex’s CF product revenues have increased quarter to quarter throughout 2017.The company is optimistic that the positive trend of CF sales will continue in 2018 as it gains additional reimbursement approvals for Orkambi in ex-U.S. markets and gets approval to launch tezacaftor(VX-661)/ivacaftor combination medicine.Meanwhile, the company has also made decent clinical progress across multiple CF studies this year and has meaningful pipeline catalysts. The market cap of Vertex is around $36 billion.Incyte Corporation (INCY  -  Free Report) Incyte’s strong oncology portfolio makes it a lucrative target for companies like Gilead, Amgen and Bristol Myers. The market cap of Incyte is more than $20 billion.The primary reason why Incyte is ripe for buyout is its two products on the market, Jakafi and Iclusig.Jakafi, a JAK inhibitor, is the first and the only product to be approved by the polycythemia vera (PV) and myelofibrosis (“MF”) – two rare blood cancers. Jakafi is seeing strong sales performance driven by strong patient demand for both indications.  In order to expand the patient population and increase the commercial potential of the drug, the company is working on expanding its label further. Iclusig is approved for chronic myeloid leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia.Meanwhile, Incyte’s pipeline boasts candidates like immune therapy epacadostat — being studied in combination with anti-PD-L1 agents of Merck, Bristol Myers and others — and Olumiant for rheumatoid arthritis – approved in Europe and regulatory application to be filed in the United States in January 2018.Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (ALXN  -  Free Report)Like BioMarin, Alexion is also focused on the development and commercialization of life-transforming drugs for the treatment of patients with ultra-rare disorders. Its key drug is Soliris, approved for two severe and ultra-rare disorders — paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) — have been consistently doing well. Meanwhile, Alexion is working on expanding the drug’s label to include additional indications, which if approved, can boost further sales growth. It has two other drugs for rare diseases called Strensiq and Kanuma, which are emerging as growth drivers. Alexion also has a robust pipeline of several candidates under development including Soliris follow-up candidate, ALXN1210.Roche, Pfizer, or Novartis may be interested in buying Alexion. The market cap of Alexion is more than $25 billion.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

723,VRTX,"Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (VRTX  -  Free Report) announced that a phase III study evaluating its key cystic fibrosis (CF) drug, Kalydeco in children (age 1-2 years) met its primary safety endpoint.Kalydeco (ivacaftor) is presently marketed for the treatment of patients (two years and above) with CF who have one of the 38 mutations in their cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene.The ARRIVAL study was conducted in young children less than two years of age who have one of 10 mutations in the CFTR gene. Not only did it reveal that Kalydeco was well tolerated in children as young as one year, the study also showed improvement across multiple endpoints, including measures of pancreatic function. Based on this data, Vertex plans to file regulatory applications for approval of Kalydeco in children aged 1 to 2 years in the first quarter of 2018. The study, however, continues in infants less than one year of age.If approved for use in this additional patient population, sales of Kalydeco may improve further. Please note that Kalydeco’s sales rose 35% in 2015, 11% in 2016 and 12% in the first nine months of 2017.Year to date, Vertex’s shares have gained 88.3%, outperforming the increase of 0.3% for the industry.For Vertex, 2017 so far has been a tremendous year with positive data read-outs and regulatory approvals leading to an increase in eligible patient population for its approved CF medicines — Kalydeco & Orkambi. With a consistent expansion in patient population, Vertex’s CF product revenues have increased quarter to quarter throughout 2017.While Vertex raised its guidance for Orkambi once, that for Kalydeco was upped twice this year. The company is optimistic that the positive trend of CF sales will continue in 2018 as it gains additional reimbursement approvals for Orkambi in ex-U.S. markets and gets approval to launch tezacaftor(VX-661) /ivacaftor combination medicine.Meanwhile, the company has also made decent clinical progress across multiple CF studies this year with meaningful pipeline catalysts lying ahead.Vertex carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

724,VRTX,"Key highlights this week include the announcement of a couple of acquisition agreements as well as pipeline news from Biogen (BIIB  -  Free Report) and Celgene (CELG  -  Free Report). The M&A announcements relate to the acquisition of Ignyta  by Roche and Sucampo Pharmaceuticals  by Mallinckrodt.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesCelgene Down on Revlimid Combo Data: Celgene’s shares were down on disappointing data on a combination evaluating the company’s blockbuster cancer drug, Revlimid, in treatment-naïve follicular lymphoma patients. The late-stage RELEVANCE study evaluated Revlimid plus Rituxan (R2) followed by R2 maintenance compared to the standard of care with Rituxan plus chemotherapy (R-CHOP, R-bendamustine or R-CVP) followed by Rituxan maintenance. The R2 treatment arm failed to achieve superiority in the co-primary endpoints of complete response or unconfirmed complete response (CR/CRu) at 120 weeks and progression-free survival (Read more: Celgene Down on Discouraging Data on Revlimid).Celgene’s shares are down 7.6% year to date compared to the 3% gain recorded by the industry it belongs to.Acquisition Agreements Announced: A couple of acquisition deals were announced this week. The first agreement will see Ignyta being acquired by Swiss pharma giant Roche in an all-cash deal valued at $1.7 billion ($27 per share). Ignyta is focused on developing precisely targeted therapeutics guided by diagnostics for patients with rare cancers. With this acquisition, slated to close in the first half of 2018, Roche will add entrectinib to its portfolio – entrectinib is currently in mid-stage development.The second agreement will see Sucampo being acquired by Mallinckrodt for $18 per share or approximately $1.2 billion. With this acquisition, Mallinckrodt will get a source of near-term net sales and earnings accretion through Amitiza and will boost its rare diseases pipeline with VTS-270 and CPP-1X/sulindac. This deal is expected to close in the first quarter of 2018. Sucampo is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock - you can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Biogen’s Shares Down on Alzheimer’s Data: Biogen’s shares declined 3.3% on data from an ongoing Alzheimer’s disease study on BAN2401, which is being developed in collaboration with Eisai. An Independent Data Monitoring Committee said that BAN2401 did not meet the criteria for success based on a Bayesian analysis at 12 months as the primary endpoint in the phase II study. With the study failing to show an early positive result, the companies said that the blinded study, which is being conducted in patients with prodromal or mild Alzheimer’s disease (collectively known as early Alzheimer’s disease) will continue with a comprehensive final analysis to be conducted at 18 months. These results are expected to be obtained during the second half of 2018. The study data comes as a disappointment as positive data would have been a major boost. Moreover, the results have raised concerns about the candidate’s chances of success given the high rate of failure experienced by other companies in bringing Alzheimer’s disease treatments to market (Read more: Biogen's Alzheimer's Drug Misses Goal in Interim Analysis).BioMarin PDUFA Date Extended: The FDA has extended the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (“PDUFA”) Goal Date for BioMarin Pharmaceutical’s (BMRN  -  Free Report) pegvaliase by three months to May 28, 2018. BioMarin is looking to get the investigational therapy approved for the reduction of blood phenylalanine (Phe) levels in adult patients with phenylketonuria (“PKU”) who have uncontrolled blood Phe levels on existing management. The extension was expected as the agency had asked the company to submit additional Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls (""CMC"") information. The company said that due to the Memorial Day weekend, the Action Goal Date will be May 25, 2018 (Read more: Biogen's Alzheimer's Drug Misses Goal in Interim Analysis).Agios Submits Ivosidenib NDA: Agios Pharmaceuticals (AGIO  -  Free Report) has submitted a New Drug Application (“NDA”) seeking FDA approval for ivosidenib (AG-120), an investigational oral treatment for patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (R/R AML) and an isocitrate dehydrogenase-1 (IDH1) mutation. The company has asked for priority review which would cut down the review period to six months.Agios also announced that it has received permission from the FDA to move another pipeline candidate, AG-270, into clinical studies. The company intends to commence a phase I study in the first quarter of 2018.PerformanceMedical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % Return Medical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % ReturnThe NASDAQ Biotechnology Index gained 1.3% over the last four trading sessions.

725,VRTX,"Key highlights this week include the FDA approval of Luxturna, the first gene therapy for a genetic disease, the first and only pharmacologic treatment for an inherited retinal disease (“IRD”) and the first adeno-associated virus (“AAV”) vector gene therapy and the earlier-than-expected label expansion of Exelixis’s (EXEL  -  Free Report) Cabometyx.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesEarlier-than-Expected Label Expansion for Exelixis’s Cabometyx: Exelixis received a boost with the earlier-than-expected FDA approval of Cabometyx for the first-line treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma (“RCC”) patients. Cabometyx was previously approved for use in advanced RCC patients who have received anti-angiogenic therapy. Approval for the first-line indication will expand the patient population significantly.The approval is based on results which showed that Cabometyx demonstrated a clinically meaningful and statistically significant reduction (52%) in the rate of disease progression or death with median progression free survival (“PFS”) for Cabometyx being 8.6 months compared to 5.3 months for sunitinib.According to information provided by the company in its press release, about 14,000 patients in the country need first-line treatment for advanced kidney cancer every year, almost as many patients as the second and third lines taken together. This represents significant opportunity for the company to grow Cabometyx sales.Exelixis’s shares are up 78.9% year to date, compared to the 3% gain recorded by the industry it belongs to.Spark’s Gene Therapy Gets FDA Nod: Spark Therapeutics (ONCE  -  Free Report) gained FDA approval for its one-time gene therapy, Luxturna for patients with confirmed biallelic RPE65 mutation-associated retinal dystrophy. This makes Luxturna the first gene therapy for a genetic disease, the first and only pharmacologic treatment for an IRD and the first AAV vector gene therapy to be approved in the United States. According to the FDA, biallelic RPE65 mutation-associated retinal dystrophy affects approximately 1,000 to 2,000 patients in the United States. Although approval was expected considering a favorable FDA advisory panel vote in October, the decision came ahead of the Jan 12, 2018 Prescription Drug User Fee Act (“PDUFA”) date.Spark is yet to provide information about pricing which will be a key factor in influencing the treatment’s uptake. The company said that Luxturna will be available for administration at treatment centers late in the first quarter of 2018 while pricing and other details will be provided early in January.Spark will also get a rare disease priority review voucher which can be used to gain priority review for any subsequent drug application that is not eligible for priority review. The company can also sell the voucher for millions of dollars to any other company that wants to fasten the review process for its candidate. BioMarin, United Therapeutics and Knight Therapeutics are some of the companies that sold their priority review vouchers for millions of dollars.New SMA Collaboration between Biogen & Ionis: Biogen (BIIB  -  Free Report) has entered into a new collaboration agreement with Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (IONS  -  Free Report) under which new antisense oligonucleotide drug candidates will be identified for the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy (“SMA”). This new agreement will allow Biogen to license therapies arising out of the collaboration with the company being responsible for their development and commercialization.Biogen will make an upfront payment of $25 million as well as payments on the achievement of development and regulatory milestones and tiered royalties. The companies already have an SMA treatment, Spinraza, on the market, which was developed under a collaboration agreement.

726,VRTX,"Higher hopes of the tax reform of being passed have acted as the latest catalyst in driving the Wall Street to new highs. In particular, the Nasdaq Composite Index gained 0.8% on the day, outperforming the other two benchmarks, the S&P 500 and Dow Jones, and hit the major milestone of 7,000 for the first time.The surging technology sector, which accounts for nearly half of the index, as well as broad bullish sentiments helped Nasdaq to lead higher with a gain of 30% this year compared with gains of 25.5% for the Dow Jones and 20.2% for the S&P 500 (read: 5 Tech ETFs That Crushed FANG ETFs in 2017).A combination of factors like improving global fundamentals, strong corporate earnings, a rising interest rate scenario, and the emergence of cutting-edge technology are acting as the key catalysts to these stocks.

Rising oil prices, pick up in activities in most part of the world as well as improved global sentiments have added to the strength.As a result, PowerShares QQQ QQQ, which serves as a proxy for the index, has climbed nearly 34% this year so far.

727,VRTX,"The biotech sector has had a great year, with SPDR S&P Biotech ETF (XBI  -  Free Report) adding over 39% (as of Dec 11, 2017). Ebbing tensions over the price gouging issue, hopes of easing regulation, positive clinical trials, FDA approvals of drugs and success in the immune-oncology field led to this rally.One of the top-performers in the space,Virtus LifeSci Biotech Clinical Trials ETF (BBC  -  Free Report), is up about 50.8% in the year-to-date frame (as of Dec 11, 2017). However, a steep price rise results in overvaluation concerns. Many may fear high-beta sell-off in the space next year.Below we highlight a few factors that could power the rally.Likely Tax ReformWith the tax reform a few hurdles away from enactment, there is a reason to cheer for biotech stocks. The reforms seek to lower the corporate tax rate from 35% to 20%, which can boost drug/biotech companies. The change in tax code will also permit companies to bring back huge cash held overseas at a one-time tax rate of 10% (read: Senate Passes Tax Bill: 5 ETFs to Buy Now).Upbeat Clinical Trials & FDA ApprovalsSuccessful clinical trials for new drugs are also acting as tailwinds for the space. Notable improvement was noted in cancer drug data. Clovis Oncology (CLVS  -  Free Report) said in June that the clinical trial data on its ovarian cancer drug treatment indicated that it may substantially help more patients than expected. The news acted as a catalyst to the entire space (read: 4 Stocks & ETFs to Buy on Clovis' Positive Drug Data).This month, impressive clinical data on blood-disorder medications were released. Among breakthrough U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approvals, Vertex Pharmaceuticals’ (VRTX  -  Free Report) new FDA approval for cystic fibrosis drug and the Novartis AG breakthrough gene transfer treatment were notable.Merger and Acquisitions to Perk Up Tax reform and cash repatriation may lead to a rise in biotech merger and acquisitions. In any case, mergers and acquisitions over the last few years have been great for biotech companies to reduce competition for the same kind of offerings and attain synergies. Tax reform should leave companies with more cash to pursue their dream deals. Expectations are rife that big players like Sanofi, Pfizer and Merck will announce M&A deals in 2018.ETFs to Tap That said, we would like to note that overvaluation may come in the way of the rally. So, it’s better to bet on ETFs that still have low valuation. For that, below we highlight a few biotech ETFs that have considerably a low P/E in the sector and can benefit investors with solid gains (see all Health Care ETFs here).SPDR S&P Biotech ETF (XBI  -  Free Report) – P/E 16.41xVanEck Vectors Biotech ETF (BBH  -  Free Report) – P/E 18.14xLoncar Cancer Immunotherapy ETF (CNCR  -  Free Report) – P/E 20.01xiShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF (IBB  -  Free Report) – P/E 21.98xWant key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.

728,VRTX,"Major biotech stocks like Gilead (GILD  -  Free Report), Celgene (CELG  -  Free Report), Alexion, AbbVie (ABBV  -  Free Report) and Vertex (VRTX  -  Free Report) reported second quarter results over the last few days. Companies like Gilead and Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report) also provided regulatory updates. Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesA Look at Q2 Earnings Results: Gilead’s results were strong with the company’s HIV franchise putting in a strong performance and the hepatitis C virus (HCV) franchise performing better than expected. The company raised its revenue outlook including for the HCV franchise (Read more: Gilead Tops Q2 Earnings & Revenue Estimates, Stock Up). Celgene also topped estimates and raised its earnings guidance for the year (Read more: Celgene Beats Q2 Earnings & Sales Estimates, Ups View) as did Alexion (Read more: Alexion Tops Q2 Earnings & Revenues, Ups 2017 View). Vertex (Read more: Vertex Q2 Earnings Top on Solid Cystic Fibrosis Sales) and AbbVie too topped expectations (Read more: AbbVie Tops Q2 Earnings & Revenues, Outlook Intact).Earlier-Than-Expected FDA Approval for Celgene/Agios Cancer Drug: Celgene and partner, Agios (AGIO  -  Free Report) gained FDA approval for Idhifa (enasidenib) for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (R/R AML) with IDH2 mutation as detected by an FDA approved test. The approval came ahead of the FDA action date of Aug 30, 2017.This makes Idhifa the first and only FDA-approved therapy for this patient population, which represents 8 – 19% of AML patients, as per information provided by the companies. More than 21,000 new cases of AML are detected every year in the U.S. with the majority of patients seeing their disease relapse eventually. The prognosis for R/R AML is poor with overall survival for this patient population estimated to be less than six months. Although Idhifa comes with a boxed warning regarding differentiation syndrome, uptake should be strong given the significant unmet medical need.Will it be Third Time Lucky for Dynavax’s Heplisav-B? Dynavax’s (DVAX  -  Free Report) shares shot up on a favorable recommendation (12-1) from the FDA’s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC) for Heplisav-B, a vaccine for immunization against hepatitis B infection in adults. With the positive vote, expectations are high that the company will finally gain approval for the vaccine which had previously received two complete response letters (one in Nov 2016 and the other in Feb 2013). A decision from the agency is expected on Aug 10. If approved, Dynavax plans to launch the vaccine early next year. Dynavax’s shares are up a whopping 284.8% year to date, significantly outperforming the industry’s 9.8% rally (Read more: Dynavax Shares Jump 75% after FDA Committee Approval).Vertex Ups CF Outlook on Kalydeco Label Expansion: Vertex’s cystic fibrosis (CF) drug Kalydeco’s label has been expanded in the U.S. and can now be used in the more than 600 CF patients (2 years and older) who have one of five residual function mutations that result in a splicing defect in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. With this label expansion, Vertex upped its 2017 sales guidance for the drug to $770 million - $800 million (old guidance: $740 - $770 million). Vertex now expects total CF product revenues of $1.87 billion - $2.1 billion (old guidance: $1.84 - $2.07 billion), including Orkambi sales of $1.1 billion - $1.3 billion (unchanged).Regulatory Updates from Amgen and Gilead: Amgen provided quite a few regulatory updates over the last few days. The company said that it has submitted a regulatory application in the U.S. seeking label expansion for Prolia for the treatment of patients with glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis (GIOP). Prolia brought in sales of $930 million in the first half of 2017.Amgen along with partner Allergan also said that they have filed for FDA approval of ABP 980, a biosimilar candidate to Roche’s Herceptin (trastuzumab). Herceptin is approved for the treatment of HER2+ adjuvant breast cancer, metastatic breast cancer and metastatic gastric cancer in the U.S.Meanwhile, Amgen’s PCSK9 inhibitor, Repatha, got priority review in the U.S. for the inclusion of FOURIER cardiovascular outcomes study data on the reduction in the risk of cardiovascular events. A decision from the agency is expected on Dec 2, 2017. Amgen said that a second application for the expansion of the lipid-lowering indication to include additional patient populations studied was also accepted by the agency.Gilead also had some updates on the regulatory front. The company said that its HCV drug, Epclusa’s label was updated in the U.S. to include use in patients co-infected with HIV. Epclusa, which initially gained approval in Jun 2016, is an all-oral, pan-genotypic, once-daily single tablet regimen. The label expansion provides co-infected patients with a convenient one-pill-a-day regimen that works across all HCV genotypes and is compatible with widely-used antiretroviral regimens. Epclusa sales crossed $2 billion in the first half of 2017.Moreover, Gilead’s latest HCV offering Vosevi gained approval in the EU for the treatment of all genotypes. The marketing authorization for Harvoni in the EU was also extended allowing use in the adolescent population. Vosevi was approved in the U.S. a few weeks back in July.Gilead is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock -- you can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.PerformanceMedical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % Return Medical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % ReturnThe NASDAQ Biotechnology Index declined 2.5% over the last five trading sessions.

729,VRTX,"The pharma sector has been a moderate performer this year with the NYSE ARCA Pharmaceutical Index adding about 10.4% so far this year (as of Nov 24, 2017), underperforming the S&P 500 (up 15.3%) and the Nasdaq (26.9%).But this underperformance did not eat into the issuer’s enthusiasm. Direxion recently launched a triple-leverage pharmaceutical fund, in the name of Daily Pharmaceutical & Medical Bull 3X Shares (PILL  -  Free Report).Let’s delve a little deeper and find out what caused the issuer to shoot a leveraged fund on this apparently-underperforming (at the current level) space.Inside PILLThe fund looks to track 300% of the performance of the Dynamic Pharmaceutical Intellidex Index. The underlying index comprises common shares of companies that are into research and development, manufacturing and distribution of pharmaceuticals and drugs of all types.Abbvie Ord Shs (6.13%), Bristol-Myers Squibb Ord (5.19%) and Pfizer Ord (5.17%) are the top three holdings of the fund. Pharmaceutical stocks occupy about 66.8% of the portfolio while biotechnology stocks account for the rest. The fund charges 1.13% annually.How Does It Fit in a Portfolio?Price gouging has been nagging the space. Though the threat has subsided a lot in the Trump era after a more vocal protest against it by his democratic opponent Hillary Clinton during the campaign days, the sector still faces risks of price controversies. Still, the long-term prospects of the space appear bright.However, as we progress toward the close of 2017, the pharma sector continues to perform well on breakthrough U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approvals, success in the immune-oncology field, and mergers and acquisitions (read: Should You Keep Your Portfolio Healthy with Biotech ETFs?).In the third quarter of 2017, biotech stock Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX  -  Free Report) received a new FDA approval for cystic fibrosis drug, Kalydeco.

731,VRTX,"Galapagos NV (GLPG  -  Free Report) announced positive top-line data from a phase II study – ALBATROSS – evaluating its cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance (“CFTR”) corrector candidate, GLPG2222, in cystic fibrosis (""CF"") patients. It led to improvements in lung function.So far this year, Galapagos’shares have outperformed the industry. The stock has gained 41.5% compared with an increase of 1.5% registered by the industry.The phase II study evaluated two once-daily doses – 150 mg and 300 mg – of the candidate in CF patients who have one gating mutation and an F508del mutation and were on long-term stable treatment with Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated’s (VRTX  -  Free Report) CF drug, Kalydeco. Treatment with Kalydeco was continued during the course of the study.The study achieved its primary objective of safety and was well tolerated in the patient population. Data also showed an improvement of 2.2% in mean percent predicted FEV1 (a measure of lung function) compared to baseline in 300 mg arm of the study.Meanwhile, Vertex is also developing a combination therapy, tezacaftor plus Kalydeco, in similar indication.Apart from GLPG2222, Galapagos is also developing GLPG2737, a CFTR regulator, in a phase I study and GLPG1837, a CFTR potentiator, in a phase II study in CF patients.

732,VRTX,"The biotech industry turned around this year after the drug pricing issue crippled its performance last year.It had a number of things going in its favor. Strong quarterly results, new product sales ramp up with rising demand, successful innovation and product line expansion, strong clinical study results, more frequent FDA approvals and continued strong performance from legacy products played a pivotal role in bringing the sector on track this year.However, after rising 15.4% in the first nine months of the year (January-September), the Medical-Biotech /Genetics industry has declined 13.4% so far in the fourth quarter (Oct 1 - to date). Both macro and industry specific factors resulted in the sudden downfall.Uncertain Macro PictureA big component of this sell-off is the confusion over the passing of the tax reform. The reform aims to bring down corporate tax to stimulate economic as well as employment growth.The proposed tax reforms, if approved, will leave more cash in the hands of biotech companies. The cash can be invested for mergers/acquisitions, which have been relatively fewer this year compared with the last. It goes without saying that significant uncertainty regarding the timely passing of the U.S. tax reform has cast a shadow over the future of the biotech sector.In October, President Trump once again criticized high drug prices. This came at a time when investors had started to expect that Trump's action on drug prices may not be as onerous as previously feared, sending health-care stocks lower.Tepid Q3 ResultsComing to some industry specific factors, most big biotechs beat estimates for earnings and sales in Q3. However, shares of most of these companies declined post earnings release for various reasons.Although Gilead (GILD  -  Free Report) topped both earnings and revenue estimates in the third quarter, it witnessed continued decline in sales of its HCV drugs — Harvoni and Sovaldi — as a result of competitive and pricing pressure.Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report) also beat expectations for both earnings and sales in Q3 and raised its earnings guidance for 2017. However sales declined year over year, which resulted in share price decline post the earnings call. Sales of its PCSK9 inhibitor, Repatha, were also disappointing.Celgene’s (CELG  -  Free Report) shares plunged following the release of third-quarter results. Although Celgene’s earnings topped estimates, revenues fell short. Moreover, the company lowered its 2017 outlook for Otezla sales as well as its total revenue and earnings outlook for 2020.Although Biogen’s (BIIB  -  Free Report) third-quarter results were better than expected, shares were down 3.9% on concerns regarding the company’s multiple sclerosis franchise sales as well as U.S. sales of its recently launched spinal muscular atrophy (“SMA”) treatment, Spinraza.Alexion (ALXN  -  Free Report) topped earnings estimates but missed on revenues in the third quarter.Vertex (VRTX  -  Free Report) and AbbVie (ABBV  -  Free Report) were the only two outperformers in Q3.ConclusionWe believe that the biotech space should be back on track if there is more certainty regarding the timing of the tax reforms. This is because the fundamentals of the sector remain strong. Meanwhile, with the Q3 earnings season now behind us, stocks should start picking up. Positive data from key clinical studies can drive the sector up as share price of biotechs is correlated to success in key studies. The major biotech players need an infusion of new growth drivers in their pipeline/product portfolios — either from internal development or from buying assets from outside. Strategic deals signed by these biotechs can also push the stocks higher.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

733,VRTX,"The second-quarter reporting cycle is in full swing. The quarter, undoubtedly, is off to a strong start.As of Jul 26, 2017, 171 S&P 500 members, accounting for 44.1% of the index’s total market capitalization, reported results, according to Earnings Preview.Total earnings for these 171 index members were up 8.8% from the year-ago quarter on a 3.4% improvement in revenues.

(BIIB  -  Free Report) released their second-quarter results this week. Both the companies beat earnings and revenue estimates and raised their sales and earnings expectations for the full year. Moreover, Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (VRTX  -  Free Report) and Amgen Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report) reported encouraging second-quarter results on Jul 26, beating estimates on both counts. However, GlaxoSmithKline plc (GSK  -  Free Report) reported mixed second-quarter results the same day, beating on earnings but missing on sales.Let’s take a look at two large-cap pharma companies that are set to report second-quarter results on Jul 28.AbbVie Inc.

734,VRTX,"Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (VRTX  -  Free Report) reported second-quarter 2017 earnings per share of 10 cents (including the impact of stock-based compensation expense), which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 6 cents. Notably, the company had posted a loss of 1 cent in the year-ago quarter. Strong product revenues led to higher profits in the quarter.Excluding stock-based compensation expense, second-quarter adjusted earnings were 39 cents per share compared with the year-ago figure of 24 cents.Vertex reported revenues of $544.1 million in the second quarter, up 26.1% year over year driven by strong product revenues. Revenues also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $487.9 million by 11.5%.CF Franchise Sales StrongVertex’s second-quarter revenues consisted of sales from cystic fibrosis (CF) products — Kalydeco and Orkambi, collaborative ($27.3 million) and royalty revenues ($2.9 million). CF product revenues were $514 million in the second quarter, up 21% year over year.Kalydeco sales rose 5% to $190 million gaining from inventory stocking of $5 million ahead of the Jul 4 holiday.In May this year, Kalydeco was approved for use in CF patients 2 years and older who have one of 23 residual function mutations in the CFTR gene. More than 900 people in the U.S. have one of these mutations. The expanded indication should boost sales of the drug in future quarters.Orkambi (lumacaftor/ivacaftor) delivered sales of $324.0 million, up 32% year over year. On a sequential basis, Orkambi sales rose almost 10% in the second quarter, supported by continued uptake globally and further uptake in the pediatric indication for which approval was received in Sep 2016. Meanwhile, an inventory stocking of $10 million ahead of the Jul4 holiday also benefited sales in the second quarter.Costs RiseAdjusted (including stock-based compensation expenses) research and development expenses increased 10% to $284.3 million in the second quarter due to higher costs related to development of triple combination CF regimens. Adjusted (including stock-based compensation expenses) selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased 10.7% to $121.7 million due to increased investment to support the global launch of Orkambi.Maintains 2017 GuidanceVertex maintained its 2017 guidance for Orkambi and Kalydeco sales but raised its guidance for combined operating costs.Orkambi revenues are expected in the range of $1.1–$1.3 billion while Kalydeco revenues are estimated in the range of $740 million - $770 million. We remind investors that following the approval for the additional indication in May, Kalydeco 2017 revenue guidance was upped to $740 million - $770 million from $710 to $730 million. Total CF product revenues are expected in the range of $1.84 billion to $2.07 billion in 2017.Combined adjusted research and development (R&D) and selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses in 2017 are anticipated in the range of $1.33 to $1.36 billion, higher than $1.25–$1.30 billion expected previously.Costs are expected to be higher due to accelerated development of the triple combination CF pipeline and investment to develop CTP-656.Focus on Triple Combination CF RegimensVertex is evaluating some next-generation CFTR correctors (VX-152, VX-440, VX-659 and VX-445) as part of a triple combination withVX-661 (tezacaftor) and ivacaftor.Data from VX-152 and VX-440 phase II and VX-659 phase I triple combination studies, conducted on CF patients who have one F508del mutation and one minimal function mutation (F508del/Min), were presented last week. The data demonstrated that all three combinations led to pronounced improvement in lung function. In fact, these are the first data to show the potential to treat the underlying cause of CF in patients who have a severe and difficult-to-treat type of the disease.Following discussions with regulatory agencies, Vertex will initiate pivotal phase III studies on one or two of the four triple combination regimens in the first half of 2018.Other CF Pipeline UpdateIn March, positive data from two phase III studies – EVOLVE and EXPAND – evaluating Kalydeco in combination with VX-661 (tezacaftor) in CF patients with two copies of the F508del mutation were also announced. Both studies met their primary endpoints and demonstrated statistically significant improvements in lung function. Based on positive outcome from the studies, the company recently submitted regulatory applications in both the U.S. and EU. Encouragingly, the combination was also granted Orphan Drug designation by the FDA in June.Earlier this week, Vertex announced that it has closed the previously announced agreement to buy Concert Pharmaceuticals, Inc.’s (CNCE  -  Free Report) CF pipeline candidate, CTP-656. Vertex plans to develop CTP-656 for potential use in future once-daily regimens in combination with its other pipeline drugs to treat the underlying cause of CF.Our TakeVertex’s second-quarter results were encouraging, topping estimates on both counts as sales of both its CF drugs rose.Shares declined slightly in after-hours trading probably in response to the hike in operating costs expectations for the year. However, so far this year, Vertex’s share priceis up a massive 121.8%, comparing favorably with an increase of 12% for the industry.Meanwhile, Vertex’s CF pipeline is quite strong with a broad portfolio of next-generation CF correctors. Its triple combination CF regimens are considered crucial for long-term growth. If the triple-combo regimes are successful, Vertex can address a significantly larger CF patient population– almost 90% of patients with CF - in the future.However, one cannot forget potential competition for Vertex’s triple combos. Belgian company, Galapagos NV (GLPG  -  Free Report) and AbbVie, Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report) are also developing triple CFTR combination therapy for CF.Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated QuoteVertex sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

735,VRTX,"Efficiency, the ability to transform inputs into outputs, is a potential indicator of a company’s financial health. Companies with favorable efficiency levels are likely to be on investors’ radar irrespective of market conditions. This is because a company with a favorable efficiency level is expected to provide impressive returns as it is believed to be positively correlated with its price performance.Ratios to Evaluate Efficiency LevelsWe have considered four popular ratios in order to find efficient companies that have the potential to provide impressive returns.Inventory TurnoverInventory level is one of the key indicators of a company’s business health. While a high inventory level may indicate that the company is going through a rough patch in terms of sales, a dwindling level may indicate that the company will run out of stock in a favorable sales condition. This is where inventory turnover comes into play. It is the ratio of 12-month cost of goods sold (COGS) to a 4-quarter average inventory. Thus, a high value of the ratio indicates a low level of inventory relative to COGS, while a low ratio signals that the company has excess inventory.Receivables TurnoverThis ratio is used to measure a company’s capability to extend its credit and collect debts on the basis of that credit. The receivables turnover ratio or the “accounts receivable turnover ratio” or the “debtor’s turnover ratio” is calculated by dividing 12-month sales by four-quarter average receivables. While a high ratio may indicate that the company efficiently collects its accounts receivables or has quality customers, a low ratio may signal that the company has an inefficient collection procedure or has low-quality customers or an inefficient credit policy.Asset UtilizationThis is a widely used measure of a company’s efficiency. Asset utilization indicates a company’s potential to utilize its assets. It is the ratio of total sales over the past 12 months to the last 4-quarter average of total assets. So, the higher the ratio, the greater is the possibility that the company is utilizing its assets efficiently. On the contrary, a low value of the ratio may signal that it is failing to use its assets effectively.Operating MarginAnother popular efficiency ratio is operating margin. Operating profit margin, which is simply operating income over the past 12 months divided by sales over the same period, indicates how well a company is controlling its operating expenses. If a company has a high operating profit margin in relation to its competitors, it is doing a better job at controlling operating expenses.All these ratios can be considered as effective measures if one compares different companies within a particular sector or industry. This is the reason why we have considered only those companies that have ratios higher than their respective industry averages.Screening ParametersIn addition to the above-mentioned ratios, we have added a favorable Zacks Rank – Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) – to the screen with an objective to make this strategy more profitable.Inventory Turnover, Receivables Turnover, Asset Utilization and Operating Margin greater than industry average:  Higher value of these ratios than the industry averages may indicate that the efficiency level of the company is greater than its peers.    The use of these criteria has narrowed down the universe of around 7,887 stocks to only 18. Here are the top five stocks:Farmers & Merchants Bancorp Inc (FMAO  -  Free Report) operates as a bank holding company for The Farmers & Merchants State Bank that provides commercial banking, retail banking, and other financial services to individuals and small businesses in northwest Ohio and northeast Indiana.

736,VRTX,"With just a handful of biotech companies left to report third quarter results, focus is back on regulatory and pipeline updates. Among major news this week, Dynavax Technologies (DVAX  -  Free Report) finally gained FDA approval for its hepatitis B vaccine while Loxo Oncology (LOXO  -  Free Report) was in the news for its collaboration agreement with Bayer.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesLoxo down despite Bayer Deal worth Up To $1.55 Billion: Loxo, which is focused on the development of highly selective medicines for patients with genetically defined cancers, saw its shares lose ground despite the announcement of a collaboration agreement with Bayer that could be worth up to $1.55 billion. The companies are collaborating for the global development and commercialization of Loxo’s highly selective TRK inhibitors, larotrectinib and LOXO-195, for patients with TRK fusion cancers.The agreement terms include a $400 million upfront payment. Loxo could receive another $450 million on the achievement of certain regulatory and commercial milestones and an additional $200 million for milestones related to LOXO-195. Development costs will be split equally by the companies. The companies will co-promote in the United States while Loxo will receive tiered, double-digit royalties on net sales, and sales milestones totaling $475 million for ex-U.S. territories. Larotrectinib is scheduled to be filed for FDA approval in late 2017/early 2018.Loxo’s shares were down 4.1% on the news with the investment community expressing disappointment about the sharing of profits in the United States as well as the absence of an outright acquisition deal.FDA Nod for Dynavax Hepatitis B Vaccine: It turned out to be third time lucky for Dynavax with the company finally gaining FDA approval for its hepatitis B vaccine, Heplisav-B. The regulatory action makes Heplisav-B the first new hepatitis B vaccine in the United States in more than 25 years and the only two-dose hepatitis B vaccine for adults.Hepatitis B, a highly infectious and potentially deadly virus, affects a wide range of adults in the United States with infections on the rise given the absence of any cures. However, hepatitis B can be prevented through vaccination.Heplisav-B is the first FDA-approved product for Dynavax and the company expects to launch the vaccine in the first quarter of 2018.Achillion Slips on Secondary Offering News: Achillion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (ACHN  -  Free Report) was down 4.2% on news that one of its shareholders, Johnson & Johnson Innovation-JJDC, Inc. (""JJDC""), is selling the whole of its equity positon in Achillion (approximately 18.4 million shares). Achillion will not receive any part of the proceeds from the offering.We remind investors that Achillion had an agreement with Johnson & Johnson’s Janssen Pharmaceuticals for hepatitis C virus (""HCV"") treatments. At the time of announcing the HCV agreement in May 2015, J&J and Achillion had also announced an equity transaction under which JJDC would invest $225 million in Achillion and get approximately 18.4 million newly issued and unregistered shares. Achillion’s shares were down significantly when the company had announced the termination of the HCV agreement in September 2017 (Read more: Achillion's HCV Partnership with J&J Terminated, Stock Falls).Year to date, Achillion’s shares are down 10.7% compared to the industry’s 1.5% rally.Zymeworks Inks Deal with J&J Company: Zymeworks Inc. , a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company, announced a licensing agreement with Janssen Biotech, a J&J company, for the development and commercialization of next generation bispecific antibody therapeutics.Under the deal, Janssen will get a worldwide, royalty-bearing license to research, develop, and commercialize up to six bispecific antibodies using Zymeworks’ Azymetric and EFECT platforms. Zymeworks is entitled to an upfront payment of $50 million plus up to $282 million in development milestones and up to $1.12 billion in commercial milestone payments, as well as tiered royalties on potential sales.Janssen also has the option to add two more bispecific programs to the deal which would mean additional money for Zymeworks.The deal is a boost for Zymeworks which already has partnership agreements with several other large companies like Merck, Lilly, Celgene, Glaxo and Daiichi Sankyo. Including the J&J deal, Zymeworks has the potential to earn milestones worth a total of $5.5 billion from all these agreements.Zymeworks is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock.

Approval for this age group would expand the targeted patient population by about 3,400 patients. A decision should be out within three months. Orkambi, which is already approved for this age group in the United States, is expected to bring in revenues of $1.29 billion - $1.32 billion in 2017. Meanwhile, the company expects to seek regulatory approval for the use of Orkambi in children with CF in the two to five years age group who have two copies of the F508del mutation in the first quarter of 2018 (Read more: Vertex Gets CHMP Recommendation for Orkambi Label Expansion).PerformanceMedical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % Return Medical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % ReturnThe NASDAQ Biotechnology Index declined 2.5% over the last four trading sessions.

737,VRTX,"Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc. (VRTX  -  Free Report) announced that the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (""CHMP"") has recommended approval of a label expansion for Orkambi in Europe. The company is seeking extension of its marketing authorization for Orkambi to include use in children with cystic fibrosis (""CF"") who are aged between 6 and 11 years and have two copies of the F508del mutation.We note that the European Commission generally follows the recommendation of the CHMP but is not bound by it. A decision is typically expected within three months of recommendation.We remind investors that Orkambi is currently approved in the EU for the treatment of CF in patients aged 12 years and above who have two copies of the F508del mutation in their CF transmembrane conductance regulator (""CFTR"") gene.Vertex’s stock has outperformed the industry so far this year. Shares are up 101.9% compared with the industry’s gain of 2.3% in the period.The company believes that the label expansion will increase the eligible patient population by 3400 in Europe. The drug is already approved in the United States for this indication.Orkambi generated net sales of $955.5 million in the first nine months of 2017, growing over 35% from the year-ago period. The potential label expansion will further boost the drug’s sales.Meanwhile, the company has completed part 2 of a phase III study evaluating Orkambi in CF patients of two to five years of age who have two copies of the F508del mutation in their CFTR gene. Last month the company announced that the study met its primary endpoint of safety.

738,VRTX,"Key highlights in the biotech sector over the past week include earnings results from companies like Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (REGN  -  Free Report) and the lifting of the clinical hold imposed by the FDA on a couple of studies being conducted on Cellectis’s (CLLS  -  Free Report) UCART123.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesSolid Q3 Results from Regeneron: Regeneron’s third quarter results were strong with the company surpassing both earnings and revenue expectations. Flagship product, Eylea, continues to perform well. On the third quarter call, Regeneron said that the diabetic macular edema (“DME”) indication represents significant growth opportunity considering only 10% of patients with DME in the United States are currently treated with an anti-VEGF agent. Regeneron is looking to expand Eylea’s label into diabetic retinopathy and expects to file for regulatory approval in the second half of 2018 if results from a late-stage study are positive. A supplementary biologics license application (“BLA”) for every 12-week dosing of Eylea for wet age-related macular degeneration (“AMD”) is set to be filed by year end.The Dupixent launch for atopic dermatitis is ongoing while Regeneron and its partner Sanofi expect to file for approval for the asthma indication by year end. Meanwhile, data from the ODYSSEY OUTCOMES study on PCSK9 inhibitor, Praluent, should be out in the first quarter of 2018. A regulatory application for PD-1 inhibitor, cemiplimab, is also slated for the first quarter of 2018 (Read more: Regeneron Beats on Q3 Earnings & Sales, Shares Up).Regeneron has gained 13.1% year to date, outperforming the industry’s 3% rally.Dicerna-Boehringer Ingelheim to Work Together for NASH Treatment: Dicerna Pharmaceuticals (DRNA  -  Free Report), which is focused on the development of investigational RNA interference (RNAi) therapeutics, has signed up with Boehringer Ingelheim for the discovery and development of novel RNAi therapeutics based on Dicerna’s proprietary technology platform, GalXC, for the treatment of chronic liver diseases. The initial focus will be on nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (“NASH”), a chronic liver disease with no treatment options currently approved though several companies are conducting research in this area.The agreement could see Dicerna receive more than $200 million from Boehringer, including an upfront payment, development and commercial milestone payments, and R&D reimbursement for a GalXC candidate addressing an undisclosed NASH target. Dicerna could also receive staggered royalties (up to double-digits) on worldwide net sales. Dicerna’s shares jumped 28.2% following the announcement of the deal.Keryx Down Despite Auryxia Label Expansion: Keryx Biopharmaceuticals, Inc. (KERX  -  Free Report), which is focused on developing medicines for renal disease, gained FDA approval for the label expansion of Auryxia. Auryxia can now be used for the treatment of patients with iron deficiency anemia and non-dialysis dependent chronic kidney disease (“CKD”). However, while approval for this indication, which significantly expands the patient population for Auryxia, is a positive, the company’s shares were down on disappointing third quarter results (Read more: Keryx Q3 Loss Wider Than Expected, Stock Declines).FDA Lifts Clinical Hold on Cellectis Studies: The FDA lifted the clinical hold, previously announced on Sep 4, 2017, on a couple of early-stage studies being conducted on Cellectis’s UCART123 for acute myeloid leukemia (“AML”) and blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (“BPDCN”). The hold was placed after the company had reported a death in the BPDCN study.Cellectis has agreed to several changes in the study protocols for the hold to be lifted. These include lowering the cohort dose level as well as the cyclophosphamide dose of the lympho-depleting regimen, including specific criteria on the day of UCART123 infusion, ensuring that the next three patients who will be treated in each protocol are under the age of 65 and ensuring that enrollment will be staggered across the UCART123 protocols AML123 and ABC123 with at least 28 days elapsing between the enrollments of two patients across the two studies.Although the lifting of the clinical hold comes with several restrictions, it is a relief for the company, which is focused on developing immunotherapies based on gene-edited allogeneic CAR T-cells (UCART).Cellectis is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.PerformanceMedical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % Return Medical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % ReturnThe NASDAQ Biotechnology Index gained 0.2% over the last five trading sessions. Among major biotech stocks, Regeneron was up 4.6% reflecting strong third quarter results while Gilead (GILD  -  Free Report) was down 2.3%. Over the last six months, Vertex (VRTX  -  Free Report) was up 28.1% while Celgene lost 14.1% (See the last biotech stock roundup here: Celgene, Amgen, Gilead Hit by Q3 Results, Vertex Beats on All Fronts).What's Next in the Biotech World?Several small- and mid-cap companies will be reporting results in the next few days. Moreover, companies like Dynavax Technologies Corporation (DVAX  -  Free Report) and Heron Therapeutics, Inc. should get a response from the FDA for regulatory applications filed by them. It could be third time lucky for Dynavax which is awaiting approval for its hepatitis B vaccine, Heplisav-B, with the FDA expected to respond today. Heron is awaiting a decision from the FDA for Cinvanti, which is under review for the prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (“CINV”). The FDA is expected to give its decision on November 12.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

739,VRTX,"We expect Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (VRTX  -  Free Report) to beat expectations when it reports its third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 25, after the market closes.Year to date, Vertex’s shares have soared 109.9% while the industry has recorded an increase of 12.1%.Vertex’s track record has been impressive so far. The company delivered positive earnings surprises in three of the last four quarters and missed expectations in one. The average positive earnings surprise in the last four quarters is 17.91%. In the last reported quarter, Vertex came up with a positive surprise of 11.43%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this quarter.Factors at PlayVertex’s cystic fibrosis (""CF"") drugs — Kalydeco & Orkambi — did well in the second quarter. We expect this positive trend to continue in the second as well.In May 2017, Kalydeco gained FDA approval for use in patients 2 years and older who have one of 23 residual function mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (""CFTR"") gene. Over 900 people in the United States have one of these mutations. In August, Kalydeco received approval for CF patients who have one of five residual function mutation, which causes splicing defect in the CFTR gene. Over 600 people in the United States have one of these mutations. Following these approvals for label expansion, Vertex upped its Kalydeco 2017 revenue guidance to $770-$800 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Kalydeco for the third quarter is $197 million.Orkambi’s sales growth will be dependent on reimbursement discussions in Europe in 2017. In June and July this year, Vertex struck re-imbursement agreements in Ireland and Italy, respectively, for Orkambi, thereby making the medicine more accessible in the countries. The expanded accessibility is expected to bring in more sales for the drug.In the first quarter, the company had also mentioned that if it gains reimbursement in France this year, it would contribute significantly to revenue growth. However, the company is yet to sign the agreement. The consensus estimate for Orkambi for the third quarter is $322 million.Vertex is also evaluating some next-generation CFTR correctors (VX-152, VX-440, VX-659 and VX-445) as part of a triple combination with tezacaftor and ivacaftor. Investor focus at the call will be on these triple combination CF regimens, which are crucial for long-term growth of Vertex.However, operating expenses are likely to shoot up as Vertex expands its pipeline.What Our Model IndicatesOur proven model shows that Vertex is likely to beat estimates this quarter because it has the right combination of two key ingredients. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.Zacks ESP:Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate (earnings of 39 cents) and the Zacks Consensus Estimate (earnings of 37 cents), stands at +7.24%. This is a leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank:Vertex currently has a Zacks Rank #2. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Conversely, we caution against the Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise  Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise | Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated QuoteOther Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some biotech stocks that you may also want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Clovis Oncology, Inc.

742,VRTX,"Geron Corporation (GERN  -  Free Report) is expected to report second-quarter 2017 results next week.The company’s earnings came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the last reported quarter. Let’s see how things are shaping up for the upcoming announcement.Geron’s shares outperformed the industry by rising 39.2% so far this year, while the industry witnessed a gain of 12.7%.Focus on Imetelstat Geron has no approved product in its portfolio and its top line solely comprises license fees and royalties. In such a scenario, investor focus will remain on the company’s sole pipeline candidate, Imetelstat. Geron, in collaboration with Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) Janssen Biotech, is developing the candidate for treating patients with hematologic myeloid malignancies like myelofibrosis (MF), myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and acute myelogenous leukemia (AML).In April, Geron provided a positive update on two late-stage studies for imetelstat – IMbark (phase II) for the treatment of myelofibrosis (MF), and IMerge (phase II/III) for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Owing to the favourable update, both trials are continuing unmodified.Geron informed that Janssen has completed the second internal review of data from two studies, IMbark and IMerge, on imetelstat, Janssen said that the benefit/risk profile of imetelstat in the treated patients supports continued development in lower risk MDS indication.For IMbark, the latest clinical benefit and a potential overall survival benefit observed supports continuation of the trial without modifications. The trial that assesses the safety and efficacy of imetelstat treatment in relapsed or refractory MDS will also include an assessment of overall survival. Also, the data suggest that 9.4 mg/kg is an appropriate starting dose in the studyJanssen is expected to take a decision regarding the initiation of the phase III stage of the IMerge study later this year and a decision regarding the continued development of imetelstat for relapsed or refractory MF indication next year.We expect the company to provide an update on the path forward for imetelstat development program at the second quarter conference call,Surprise HistoryGeron’s performance over the last four quarters has been mixed, with the company surpassing expectations thrice and meeting the same once.

743,VRTX,"Companies with favorable efficiency levels are likely to be on investors’ radar irrespective of market conditions. This is because a company with a favorable efficiency level is expected to provide impressive returns as it is believed to be positively correlated with its price performance.Efficiency, which is the ability to transform inputs into outputs, is a potential indicator of a company’s financial health.Key Ratios to Identify EfficiencySometimes it becomes difficult to measure the efficiency level of a company. This is the reason why one must consider popular efficiency ratios while selecting stocks. These efficiency ratios are:Inventory Turnover: The ratio of 12-month cost of goods sold (COGS) to a four-quarter average inventory is considered one of the most popular efficiency ratios. It indicates a company’s ability to maintain a suitable inventory position. While a high value indicates that the company has a relatively low level of inventory compared to COGS, a low value indicates that the company is facing declining sales, which resulted in excess inventory. Receivables Turnover:  This is the ratio of 12-month sales to four-quarter average receivables. It shows a company’s potential to extend its credit and collect debt in terms of that credit. A high receivables turnover ratio or the “accounts receivable turnover ratio” or “debtor’s turnover ratio” is desirable as it shows that the company is capable of collecting its accounts receivables or that it has quality customers.Asset Utilization: This ratio indicates a company’s capability to convert assets into output and is thus a widely known measure of efficiency level. It is calculated by dividing total sales over the past 12 months by the last four-quarter average of total assets. Like the above ratios, high asset utilization may indicate that a company is efficient.Operating Margin: This efficiency measure is the ratio of operating income over the past 12 months to sales over the same period. It measures a company’s ability to control operating expenses. Hence, a high value of the ratio may indicate that the company manages its operating expenses more efficiently than its peers.Screening ParametersIn addition to the above-mentioned ratios, we have added a favorable Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) to the screen with an objective to make this strategy more profitable. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Inventory Turnover, Receivables Turnover, Asset Utilization and Operating Margin greater than industry average (Values of these ratios higher than industry averages may indicate that the efficiency level of the company is higher than its peers.)    The use of these few criteria narrowed down the universe of over 7,906 stocks to only 19.Here are four stocks from the 19 that made it through the screen:Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (VRTX  -  Free Report) is engaged in discovering, developing, manufacturing and commercializing medicines for serious diseases.

744,VRTX,"Swiss pharmaceutical company Novartis AG (NVS  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 24.  Novartis’ stock has rallied 22.1% year to date compared with the industry’s 21.4% gain.In the last quarter, Novartis delivered a positive earnings surprise of 4.3%. The company posted an average positive earnings surprise of 3.51% in the trailing four quarters. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayConcurrent with the second-quarter results, Novartis reiterated its guidance. Net sales are expected to be broadly in line with the 2016 levels after including the impact of continued genericization of Gleevec/Glivec in the United States and Europe.Novartis operates under three segments: Innovative Medicines (Pharmaceuticals), Alcon and Sandoz (Generics). Novartis has a strong oncology portfolio of drugs like Afinitor, Exjade, Jakavi, Zykadia, Tasigna, Jadenu, and the recently approved Kisqali. The recent approval of Kymriah for acute lymphoblastic leukemia is a major boost for Novartis, given the potential in the CAR T therapy space. Meanwhile, the FDA has recently approved a label expansion of Zykadia as the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer.New products like Cosentyx and Entresto are expected to boost the top line. Cosentyx has been strong and the company has grabbed market shares from rivals like AbbVie, Inc.’s (ABBV  -  Free Report) Humira and Amgen. Inc’s (AMGN  -  Free Report) Enbrel. Cosentyx achieved the blockbuster status in 2016 and recorded over $1 billion of sales. While Entresto is expected to record $500 million revenues, sales of Cosentyx are projected to reach $2 billion in 2017.Additionally, Novartis’ generic arm, Sandoz, is making efforts to strengthen its biosimilars portfolio. The company plans to launch five biosimilars of major oncology and immunology biologics across key geographies by 2020. The company is, however, facing significant pricing pressures and this is expected to impact the third-quarter results.Also, the loss of exclusivity of some of the key drugs in Novartis’ portfolio is hurting the company’s top line.  The company’s blockbuster drug, Diovan, is facing stiff generic competition in the United States, the EU and Japan. Gleevec lost exclusivity in the United States in February 2016 and in the EU in December 2016, thereby leading to generic competition. Exforge is also facing generic competition in the United States and the EU. Furthermore, the oncology drugs are facing new competition in the form of immuno-oncology therapies.The negative impact of generic competition is expected to impact sales by $2.5 billion in 2017.The company’s ophthalmologic division, Alcon, continues to face challenges due to lower surgical equipments sales. Stiff competition faced by intraocular lens and a slowdown in demand for equipment purchases continue to act as dampeners.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Novartis will beat on earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat estimates. Unfortunately, that is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Novartis is -0.40%.  This is because both the Most Accurate estimate is 1.24 and the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.25. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Novartis currently carries a Zacks Rank #3. Although the rank is favorable, the company’s negative ESP makes its highly unlikely for earnings beat this quarter. As it is, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Novartis AG Price and EPS Surprise  Novartis AG Price and EPS Surprise | Novartis AG Quote Stock to ConsiderHere is one stock in the healthcare sector that you may want to consider, as our model shows that it has the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (VRTX  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +6.84% and a Zacks Rank #1.

The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Vertex Pharmaceuticals is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings—with the most up-to-date information possible—is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for VRTX in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at 8 cents per share for VRTX, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of 6 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for VRTX, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +33.33% heading into earnings season.Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise | Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market.

746,VRTX,"Exelixis, Inc. (EXEL  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results on Aug 2, after the market closes.Exelixis’ track record is outstanding. The company has surpassed expectations in all the four trailing quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 512.1%.Exelixis’ share price has increased 82.6% year to date compared with the Zacks classified industry’s gain of 11.7%.Factors Likely to Impact ResultsExelixis received a major boost with the FDA approval of Cabometyx tablets in Apr 2016 for the treatment of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC).The initial uptake of the drug was encouraging and is expected to propel the top line in the forthcoming quarters in 2017. The sequential increase in Cabometyx sales is also a positive. Moreover, Cabometyx was also approved in the EU.Meanwhile, Exelixis is developing cabozantinib in a broad development program. In Oct 2016, the company announced positive results from the phase II CABOSUN study on cabozantinib versus sunitinib in formerly untreated advanced RCC, which was presented at ESMO 2016. Based on the CABOSUN results, the company has planned to submit a supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) for cabozantinib for treating first-line advanced RCC in the third quarter of 2017. The company presented further positive analysis from the trial in Jun 2017. A potential label expansion of the drug will further boost results.In early 2017, Exelixis collaborated with Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY  -  Free Report) to evaluate cabozantinib in combination with Opdivo alone or in combination with Yervoy in a phase III trial in first-line RCC, and potentially in other tumor types including (HCC and bladder cancer. Exelixis will also evaluate Cabometyx in combination with Tecentriq, an anti-PD-L1 antibody, in patients with advanced RCC or bladder cancer. In Jun 2017, Exelixis initiated the dose-escalation stage of a phase Ib trial of cabozantinib in combination with Tecentriq. The drug will be evaluated in patients suffering from locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (UC) or RCC. These collaborations allow Exelixis to earn milestone payments and royalties that boost its top line.However, expenses will continue to increase. Exelixis expects total costs and operating expenses for 2017 in the range of $290 million–$310 million.Exelixis, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Exelixis, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Exelixis, Inc. QuoteEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Exelixis is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), #2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold) to be able to beat earnings. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is -33.3% since the Most Accurate is 2 cents while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 3 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. Zacks Rank: Exelixis sports a Zacks Rank #1 which is favorable. However, this when combined with a negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 and #5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some health care stocks that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (VRTX  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +33.3% and a Zacks Rank #1.

747,VRTX,"Celgene Corporation (CELG  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 27, before the opening bell. Last quarter, the company beat expectations by 4.08%.Celgene has outperformed the Zacksclassified industry in the year so far. The stock has gained 19% during this period against the industry’s11.8% gain.Celgene’s track record has been pretty decent with the company beating earnings estimates thrice in the trailing four quarters. Overall, the company has delivered an average positive surprise of 3.01%.Let's see how things are shaping up at the company ahead of this announcement.Earnings WhispersOur proven model shows that Celgene is likely to beat on earnings estimates this quarter. This is because it has the right combination of two key ingredients, a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold).Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is +0.62%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is $1.62 while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged lower at $1.61. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Celgene currently carries a Zacks Rank #3. The combination of Zacks Rank #3 and a positive ESP makes us confident of an earnings beat.Conversely, Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Factors at PlayConcurrent with the first-quarter earnings results, Celgene updated its outlook for 2017. The company now expects earnings around $7.15–$7.30 compared to the earlier forecast of $7.10–$7.25 per share. Net product sales are expected around $13.0–$13.4 billion.Celgene’s key product, Revlimid, should continue to be the main growth driver as in the first quarter, driven by share gains in important markets and longer treatment duration in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (MM).  Revlimid sales are projected between $8 billion–$8.3 billion.Currently, Celgene is working on expanding Revlimid’s label further. FDA approved Revlimidfor use as a maintenance treatment in NDMM patients after they receive an autologous stem-cell transplant. The drug was also approved in the EU for the same. NDMM market share continues to grow outside the U.S., with a positive uptake both in the EU and in Japan. A label expansion of the drug is expected to boost sales further.Meanwhile, a broad phase III program evaluating Revlimid in non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is underway.Other key products – Pomalyst/Imnovid, Abraxane and Otezla continue to perform well. Both Otezla and Pomalyst achieved blockbuster status in 2016, recording over $1 billion in sales. Otezla sales in the first quarter were impacted by managed care dynamics that led to lower total marketplace prescriptions for psoriasis therapies although the pressure is expected to ease as the year goes.Pomalyst/Imnovid is being evaluated in multiple combination studies in relapsed/refractory MM. The drug’s label was recently updated in the U.S. and the EU to include data from a pooled pharmacokinetics analysis of patients with relapsed and/or refractory MM and impaired renal function.  Pomalyst, in combination with Darzalex and dexamethasone for relapsed/refractory myeloma, is under FDA review.For 2017, Abraxane sales are estimated to be around $1 billion. While Pomalyst’s revenues are projected around $1.6 billion, the same for Otezla are estimated around $1.5 billion– $1.7 billion.Meanwhile, R&D expense as a percentage of revenues is expected to increase throughout the year.In the second-quarter call, investors are expected to remain focused on the company’s performance and label expansion efforts, along with updates on the pipeline front. Celgene has submitted a new drug application to the FDA for Idhifa in relapsed refractory AML in 2016. The NDA for Idhifa was granted Priority Review with a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) action date of Aug 30. We note that Celgene has inked an agreement with Agios Pharmaceuticals (AGIO  -  Free Report) for Idhifa.Celgene Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Celgene Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Celgene Corporation QuoteStocks Poised to Beat EstimatesHere are some other health care stocks that you may want to consider, as our model shows that they too have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (VRTX  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +33.3% and a Zacks Rank #1.

748,VRTX,"Major biotech companies reported earnings results over the last five trading days.

Meanwhile, Celgene plunged 16.4% following the release of third quarter results – although Celgene topped earnings estimates, revenues fell short. Moreover, the company lowered its 2017 outlook for Otezla sales as well as its total revenue and earnings outlook for 2020 reflecting the impact of the discontinuation of GED-0301 for Crohn’s disease, the market dynamics impacting Otezla, and the opportunities and risks associated with the late-stage data read-outs scheduled for 2018 (Read more: Celgene Tops Q3 Earnings, Sales Miss, Updates View).Vertex, which has a strong presence in the cystic fibrosis (“CF”) market, reported a strong quarter with earnings and revenues surpassing expectations.

Under the deal, signed in February 2015, Sanofi had an exclusive option for ex-U.S. development and commercial rights to VY-AADC. The deal terms included upfront payments of $100 million as well as future potential development and sales milestone payments of up to $745 million, plus tiered royalties on product sales.According to Voyager, Sanofi decided to exit the deal as the option did not include rights in the United States. With Voyager gaining global rights to the VY-AADC program for advanced Parkinson’s disease, the company said that it remains on track to dose the first patient during the second quarter of 2018.GW Finishes Rolling Drug Submission for Epilepsy Drug: GW Pharmaceuticals plc (GWPH  -  Free Report) announced that it has completed the rolling submission of a New Drug Application (“NDA”) in the United States for Epidiolex (cannabidiol) as adjunctive treatment of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (“LGS”) and Dravet syndrome.

749,VRTX,"Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (VRTX  -  Free Report) reported third-quarter 2017 earnings per share of 53 cents, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 37 cents and came ahead of the year-ago earnings of 17 cents. Strong product revenues led to higher profits in the quarter.Vertex reported revenues of $578.2 million in the third quarter, up almost 40% year over year driven by strong product revenues. Revenues also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $518.45 million.CF Franchise Sales StrongVertex’s third-quarter revenues consisted of sales from cystic fibrosis (""CF"") products — Kalydeco and Orkambi, collaborative ($26.3 million) and royalty revenues ($2.2 million). CF product revenues were $549.6 million in the third quarter, up 34% year over year.Kalydeco sales rose 22% to $213 million following approvals to treat an expanded population.In May, Kalydeco was approved for use in CF patients 2 years and older who have one of 23 residual function mutations in the CFTR gene. More than 900 people in the United States have one of these mutations. The expanded indication should boost sales of the drug in future quarters. In August, Kalydeco was approved in CF patients (2 years and older) who have one of the five residual function mutations that result in a splicing defect in the CFTR gene, which occurs in more than 600 patients.Orkambi (lumacaftor/ivacaftor) delivered sales of $336.2 million, up 43.7% year over year. The growth was supported by continued uptake in pediatric patients in the United States and additional revenues from European countries where Vertex has signed reimbursement agreements.Costs RiseAdjusted research and development expenses increased 15.3% to $243.2 million in the third quarter due to higher costs related to development of triple combination CF regimens. Adjusted selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased 7.9% to $90.6 million due to increased investment to support the global commercialization of Orkambi and Kalydeco.2017 Guidance RaisedVertex increased its 2017 guidance for Orkambi and Kalydeco sales. However, it maintained its guidance for combined operating costs.Orkambi revenues are expected in the range of $1.29–$1.32 billion (previously $1.1–$1.3 billion), while Kalydeco revenues are estimated in the range of $810 million - $830 million (previously $770 million - $800 million). Total CF product revenues are expected in the range of $2.1 billion to $2.15 billion in 2017.We note that the increase in Orkambi sales projection is based on strong demands seen so far this year. Projections for Kalydeco were increased following strong demand in newly approved indications.Combined adjusted research and development (R&D) and selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses in 2017 are still anticipated in the range of $1.33 to $1.36 billion.Focus on Next Generation CF RegimensVertex’s tezacaftor/ivacaftor combination for treating CF patients is under review in the United States and Europe. The company is seeking approval in people with CF aged 12 and older who have two copies of the F508del mutation or one F508del mutation and one residual function mutation. A decision is expected in February next year in the United States, while approval in Europe is expected in the second half of 2018.Concurrent with the press release, the company announced data from a phase III study evaluating the combination in CF patients with one copy of the F508del mutation and one copy of a gating mutation. The study has failed to meet its primary endpoint of absolute change in percent predicted forced expiratory volume in one second (ppFEV1), a measure of lung function.Vertex is also evaluating some next-generation CFTR correctors (VX-152, VX-440, VX-659 and VX-445) as part of a triple combination with VX-661 (tezacaftor) and ivacaftor. Following discussions with regulatory agencies, Vertex will initiate pivotal phase III studies on two of the four triple combination regimens in the first half of 2018.Other CF Pipeline UpdateVertex’s epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) inhibitor candidate, VX-371, is being evaluated in a phase II study in CF patients who are being treated with Orkambi. Per the press release, the study did not meet its primary endpoint of change in ppFEV1.Another phase II study is developing VX-371 for treating patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia.Our TakeVertex’s third-quarter results were encouraging. The company beat estimates on both counts as sales of both its CF drugs rose.Shares declined slightly in after-hours trading probably due to failure of the pivotal tezacaftor/ivacaftor study. However, so far this year, Vertex’s share price is up a massive 99.3%, comparing favorably with an increase of 6.9% for the industry.Vertex’s CF pipeline is quite strong with a broad portfolio of next-generation CF correctors. Its triple combination CF regimens are considered crucial for long-term growth. If the triple-combo regimes are successful, Vertex can address a significantly larger CF patient population — almost 90% of the patients — in the future.However, competition is increasing as several major companies are developing interest in CF. Belgian company Galapagos NV (GLPG  -  Free Report) and AbbVie, Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report) are also developing triple CFTR combination therapy for CF, which may pose a threat to Vertex’s triple combo regimens.Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated QuoteVertex carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).  A better-ranked stock in the health care sector is Adaptimmune Therapeutics PLC (ADAP  -  Free Report), which carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

750,VRTX,"Intercept Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (ICPT  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 31.In the last reported quarter, the company beat expectations by 15.4%. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Intercept’s share price movement in the year so far reveals that the stock outperformed the industry. The company’s shares have rallied 18.3% during this period compared with the industry’s 12.8% gain.Surprise HistoryIntercept’s track record has been decent so far, with the company surpassing expectations in three of the last four quarters. The company has posted an average positive earnings surprise of 0.06% over this period.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Intercept is likely to beat estimates this quarter because it has the right combination of two key ingredients, a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold).Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is at +9.39%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at a loss of $3.28 while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at a loss of $3.62. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Intercept currently carries a Zacks Rank #3. The combination of Zacks Rank #3 and a positive ESP makes us confident of an earnings beat in the upcoming release.Conversely, Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Factors at PlayIntercept received a major boost with the FDA’s approval (in May 2016) of its lead drug, Ocaliva, in combination with ursodeoxycholic (UDCA), for the treatment of primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) in adults with an inadequate response to UDCA or as monotherapy in adults unable to bear with UDCA. In Dec 2016, the European Commission also granted conditional approval to Ocaliva for the same indication.Ocaliva generated sales of $20.6 million in the last quarter.The initial uptake of Ocaliva has been encouraging and sales of the drug is expected topick up further in 2017.Meanwhile, Ocaliva is being evaluated for other indications including non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC).Intercept expects operating expenses in the range of $380–$420 million in 2017 to support the continued commercialization of Ocaliva in PBC in the United States and other markets, sustained clinical development for OCA in PBC and NASH and the continued advancement of INT-767 and other pipeline programs.The company initiated a phase III study (REGENERATE) on Ocaliva for the treatment of non-cirrhotic NASH in patients with advanced liver fibrosis. The FDA approved a redesign of the REGENERATE trial for the safety and efficacy in treating NASH patients with liver fibrosis. The company now needs to achieve only one co-primary endpoint – either fibrosis improvement or NASH resolution as compared to the earlier target of achieving both. The sample size of the trial has also been reduced to approximately 750 patients or about 250 patients per arm. The company plans to complete enrolment for the interim analysis cohort in the REGENERATE trial soon (data readout in 2019).Intercept also initiated a phase II study, CONTROL (Combination OCA aNdsTatins for monitoRing Of Lipids), on OCA. Enrolment in the study was completed in third-quarter 2016, with top-line data expected shortly. The company also plans to initiate a phase III trial on Ocaliva in NASH patients with cirrhosis in the second half of 2017. The company also expects top-line results from the phase II trial, AESOP, in primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). We expect investors to remain focused on sales ramp-up of Ocaliva and pipeline updates on the call.Intercept Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Intercept Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

751,VRTX,"Radius Health, Inc. (RDUS  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 financial results on Aug 3.Radius Health’s shares have outperformed the industry in the year so far. The stock has gained 13.7% during this time period against a 6.8% industry’s gain.Radius Health has a disappointing track record so far. The company has missed estimates in three of the four trailing quarters with a negative average surprise of 3.6%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this quarter.Factors at PlayRadius Health focuses on the development of therapeutics for the treatment of osteoporosis, oncology and endocrine diseases.The company’s new drug,Tymlos, was approved in the U.S. on Apr 28. The drug is instrumental in treating postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at high risk for fracture defined as history of osteoporotic fracture and multiple risk factors for fracture. The drug is also used for patients who have failed or are intolerant to other available osteoporosis therapy. The drug is under review in the EU. The drug is priced at an annualized wholesaler acquisition cost of $19,500 or $1,625 per pen.Hence, we expect investors to focus on the impending launch during the upcoming earnings call.Although the osteoporosis market in the U.S. has great potential as approximately 1.4 million postmenopausal women in the U.S. experience osteoporotic fractures each year, Tymlos is expected to face significant competition from Forteo and Prolia.Meanwhile, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) issued a second Day-180 List of Outstanding Issues and requested additional data analyses related to the safety and efficacy of abaloparatide-SC in the process of their ongoing regulatory review. The company expects the CHMP to issue an opinion regarding the MAA for abaloparatide-SC prior to the end of 2017.The company is planning to file a supplemental New Drug Application for Tymlos based on the ACTIVExtend study. In May 2017, results from the ACTIVExtend trial showed statistically significant fracture risk reduction through the 3.5 years of sequential therapy: Tymlos followed by an antiresorptive.In Jun 2017, the company announced encouraging results from an ongoing phase I study on pipeline candidate elacestrant (RAD1901) in patients suffering from estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer. The candidate,an oral selective estrogen receptor degrader (SERD), is being evaluated for potential use as an oral non-steroidal treatment for estrogen receptor positive breast cancer at high doses. During the first-quarter earnings call, the company stated that it plans to discuss the next steps for this program with the FDA. We expect the company to throw more light on the same.Radius Health, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Radius Health, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Radius Health, Inc.

753,VRTX,"DST Systems Inc.  is set to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 27. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 15.87%. Notably, DST Systemsoutperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters with an average positive earnings surprise of 10.49%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors to ConsiderDST Systems reported encouraging first-quarter results, wherein both earnings and revenues surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate and grew year over year.We are still of the opinion that DST Systems’ business volume and massive scale of operation in Financial Services will attract new customers. Moreover, we expect steady contributions from acquisitions to support revenue growth. Continued share buybacks and dividend payments are the other encouraging factors.However, persistent decline in registered accounts, ongoing consolidation in the U.S. financial services market and stiff competition from International Business Machines Corporation (IBM  -  Free Report) and Fiserv Inc. might put its fundamentals under pressure. Additionally, a high debt burden remains a major concern.DST Systems, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  DST Systems, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | DST Systems, Inc.

754,VRTX,"Quest Diagnostics Inc. (DGX  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 earnings results before the opening bell on Oct 19.Last quarter, the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 14 cents delivering a positive earnings surprise of 9.9%. Also, Quest Diagnostics outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all trailing four quarters with an average beat of 7.1%.Let’s take a look at how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayAfter several quarters of sustained drag in the company’s revenue per requisition performance,last quarter saw a slight rebound. However, it still remains to be seen if this improvement is here to stay or not. The company’s two Professional Lab Services (PLS) engagements — WJ Barnabas Health and HealthONE System of HCA Holdings, Inc. (HCA) — carry lower revenue per requisition due to the nature of work.Overall, we believe that a low level of employment and slow growth of commercially-insured lives will continuously impact the company’s volume (measured by the number of requisitions) environment till the economy turns around for better.Quest Diagnostics Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise Quest Diagnostics Incorporated price-eps-surprise | Quest Diagnostics Incorporated QuoteThis apart, unit price headwinds were less than 100 bps in the previously reported second quarter. While unit price headwinds hovered in moderate ranges (at approximately 1%) over the last few years, the company continues to expect the same for the rest of 2017 too.Also, over the last two years, Quest Diagnostics has faced several reimbursement issues that affected its revenues. The company is concerned about the CMS (Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services) proposal related to Protecting Access to Medicare Act (PAMA). We believe, reimbursement pressure will be reflected as an overhang in the company’s performance this soon-to-be-reported quarter too.Notably, the company has not positively taken the latest Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) publication of proposed 2018 Medicare reimbursement rates for clinical laboratory tests under the Clinical Lab Fee Schedule (CLFS). However, this leaves no impact on its yet-to-be-reported quarter’s revenue numbers.On a positive note, Quest Diagnostics seems to be determined to repeat its well-meaning efforts from second-quarter 2017 by stimulating the company’s performance via a two-point growth strategy to accelerate growth and drive operational excellence.We are also optimistic about the company’s successful execution of its strategy to grow esoteric testing business and drive profitable growth.Additionally, Quest Diagnostics has recently witnessed significant growth through infectious disease testing, prescription drug monitoring and industry-leading wellness business. We expect these growth drivers to remain active through the third quarter as well, driving the same metrics as in the preceding quarter.We strongly believe all these recent developments to significantly contribute to the company’s top line in the third quarter.The company currently expects full-year 2017 revenues in the range of $7.69-$7.74 billion (annualized growth of 2.6-3.4%). The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $7.7 billion, just above the lower-end of the guided range.In addition, the company’s 2017 adjusted EPS range remains at $5.62-$5.72. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.65 is within this range.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Quest Diagnostics is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Quest Diagnostics has an Earnings ESP of -2.52%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate of $1.33 is pegged lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.37. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Quest Diagnostics has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), which decreases the predictive power of ESP. Combined with a negative ESP, Quest Diagnostics’ chances of an earnings beat can not be conclusively predicted.We caution against the stocks with Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Strong Sell) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few stocks worth considering from the same space as our proven model shows them to comprise the right combination of elements to beat estimates this quarter:  The Cooper Companies, Inc.

755,VRTX,"We expect Abbott (ABT  -  Free Report) to surpass expectations when it reports third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 18, before the market opens. Last quarter, Abbott delivered a positive earnings surprise of 3.3%.Abbott’s strong and impressive earnings track record reflects its estimate beats in each of the past four quarters, delivering an average of 4.6%. Also, the company’s shares have surged 34.6% so far this year. This compares favorably with the industry’s 11.6% registered rally during the same period.Why a Likely Positive Surprise? Our proven model conclusively shows that Abbott is likely to beat on earnings this quarter because it has the right combination of two key ingredients. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for a likely positive surprise.Zacks ESP: Abbott has an Earnings ESP of +0.24%, indicative of being confident about an earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Abbott currently carries a bullish Zacks Rank #2, which increases the predictive power of ESP with a higher chance of beating estimates.Conversely, all Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) are cautioned against going into an earnings announcement.What Is Driving the Better-than-Expected Earnings?Abbott has been on a healthy growth trajectory in Established Pharmaceuticals Division (EPD) business, delivering encouraging operational sales growth in the trailing few quarters. Major part of this growth was stimulated by a series of strategic actions, including Abbott’s sale of developed market businesses along with acquisitions of CFR Pharmaceuticals in Latin America and Veropharm in Russia. Abbott Laboratories Price and Consensus  Abbott Laboratories Price and Consensus | Abbott Laboratories Quote The company also continues to expect strong growth in EPD in the upcoming quarters, particularly in China, Russia and several markets in Latin America including Brazil on the back of Abbott’s strong position lies and competitive edge in these geographies. Also, there should be chances of a certain revamp in EPD sales in India in the third quarter, following the business loss that Abbott had incurred due to implementation of a Goods and Services tax (GST) in this country in the second quarter.There haves been a slew of developments within the medical device space as well. The market is upbeat about Abbott’s FreeStyle Libre Flash Glucose Monitoring System’s recent reimbursement approval in the United Kingdom. Plus, the company has recently announced receipt of Health Canada License for FreeStyle Libre Flash Glucose Monitoring System.With these positives in place, Abbott’s FreeStyle Libre system stands partially or fully covered in 17 countries, including France, Germany and Japan. We expect this uptrend to further stimulate growth in the Diabetes Care sales segment within Medical group that improved 18.7% in second-quarter 2017 on continued consumer acceptance of FreeStyle Libre in international arenas.Within Cardiac Arrhythmias and Heart Failure business, the recent FDA approval of Abbott’s Full MagLev HeartMate 3 Left Ventricular Assist System is expected to boost the company’s sales from the third quarter itself.We are also encouraged about the ongoing synergies from the acquisition of St. Jude Medical on Jan 4, earlier in the year. The comprehensive combined portfolio appears quite promising.Notably, Abbott projects annual pre-tax synergies of $500 million by 2020, including revenue expansion opportunities as well as operational and SG&A efficiencies.For the third quarter of 2017, the company forecasts adjusted earnings per share of 64-66 cents. Comparable operational sales growth for the quarter is projected in mid-single digits.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few other companies worth considering from the same space as our proven model shows that they too have the right combination of elements to come up with an earnings beat this quarter:  QIAGEN N.V.

756,VRTX,"Companies like Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report) and Regeneron (REGN  -  Free Report) were in the news with Amgen providing pipeline and regulatory updates while Regeneron and partner Sanofi got some good news with an appeals court ruling in their favor in the PCSK9 inhibitor lawsuit against Amgen.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesPhase II Combination Data on Amgen’s Imlygic Published: Positive data on Amgen’s oncolytic viral therapy, Imlygic, when used in combination with Bristol-Myers Squibb’s Yervoy were published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology. Results from the mid-stage study showed that the objective response rate (""ORR"") more than doubled when Imlygic was used in combination with Yervoy compared to Yervoy alone in patients with unresectable stage IIIB-IV melanoma (39% versus 18%). Moreover, the complete response rate was almost double in the combination arm compared to Yervoy alone (13% versus 7%). Responses were observed in both injected and uninjected lesions, including visceral lesions.Advanced melanoma is highly aggressive and one of the most dangerous types of skin cancer with there being need for multiple treatment approaches over the course of the disease. The data is encouraging and could open up new avenues of revenues for Imlygic if it eventually gains approval for use in combination with a checkpoint inhibitor. Sales of Imlygic, approved in October 2015, are yet to pick up.Meanwhile, Amgen said that the FDA has accepted its regulatory application seeking label expansion for the use of Prolia in glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis, the most common form of secondary osteoporosis. A response from the agency should be out on May 28, 2018. Prolia, which brought in sales of $505 million in the second quarter of 2017, is an important growth driver for Amgen with the company working on improving diagnosis, treatment rates and duration in order to drive access to a greater number of patients (Read more: Amgen Label Expansion Application for Prolia Accepted by FDA).Amgen is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock. Shares of Amgen have gained 27.1% year to date, significantly outperforming the industry’s 13.9% rally. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Breather for Amgen with Neulasta Biosimilar Approval Delay: Amgen got a bit of a breather with the FDA issuing a Complete Response Letter (“CRL”) for Mylan and Biocon’s biosimilar version of Amgen’s blockbuster drug, Neulasta (pegfilgrastim). While the agency did not raise any queries regarding biosimilarity, pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic data, clinical data or immunogenicity of MYL-1401H, the CRL relates to the pending update of the regulatory application with certain CMC data from facility requalification activities post recent plant modifications.We note that Mylan and Biocon are not the only companies to get a CRL from the FDA for a biosimilar version of Neulasta. While Novartis’s Sandoz had received a CRL last year, Coherus was issued a CRL this year in June.  Regeneron/Sanofi Score a Win in PCSK9 Inhibitor Litigation: Regeneron and partner Sanofi got a major boost with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ordering a new trial related to Amgen’s claims regarding patents for PCSK9 inhibitors. The court also vacated the permanent injunction in the lawsuit which means Sanofi and Regeneron can continue selling their PCSK9 inhibitor, Praluent, in the United States (Read more: Regeneron and Sanofi Get Favorable Ruling Against Amgen).AbbVie in Immuno-Oncology Deal: AbbVie (ABBV  -  Free Report) has entered into a research, option and license agreement with clinical-stage immuno-oncology company Turnstone Biologics. The deal provides AbbVie with an exclusive option to license up to three of Turnstone's next-generation oncolytic viral immunotherapies.Turnstone’s Ad-MG1-MAGEA3 therapy is in a couple of phase I/II studies for different solid tumor indications alone as well as in combination with an approved anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor.Promising New Data on Biogen’s Spinraza: New phase III data presented by Biogen (BIIB  -  Free Report) on Spinraza showed that earlier initiation of treatment with the therapy may improve motor function outcomes in infants and children with spinal muscular atrophy (“SMA”). Biogen and Ionis’s Spinraza is the first approved medicine for the treatment of SMA. Spinraza is off to a promising start in the United States bringing in sales of $203 million in the second quarter of 2017.Clovis Seeks Label Expansion for PARP Inhibitor: Clovis Oncology (CLVS  -  Free Report) has filed for label expansion of its PARP inhibitor, Rubraca, in the United States. The company is looking to get the drug approved for the maintenance treatment of patients with recurrent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who are in a complete or partial response to platinum-based chemotherapy. The company had presented impressive late-stage data earlier this year in June on Rubraca showing that the treatment significantly improved progression-free survival in all ovarian cancer patient populations evaluated in the ARIEL3 study.Rubraca had gained accelerated FDA approval in December 2016 for use in advanced ovarian cancer patients who have been treated with two or more chemotherapies and who have deleterious germline or somatic BRCA mutations. A broader label would boost Rubraca’s sales potential (Read more: Clovis Submits sNDA for Ovarian Cancer Drug Rubraca).PerformanceMedical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % Return Medical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % ReturnThe Nasdaq Biotechnology Index was up 0.6% over the last five trading sessions.

757,VRTX,"Amgen, Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA has accepted its regulatory application in the United States seeking label expansion for Prolia for the treatment of patients with glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis (GIOP). The FDA is expected to give its decision on May 28 next year.Prolia is presently marketed in the United States for the treatment of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at high risk for fracture as well as to increase bone mass in men with osteoporosis at high risk for fracture.The supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) was submitted in July this year. The sBLA was based on a phase III study evaluating the safety and efficacy of Prolia compared with risedronate in patients receiving glucocorticoid medications.GIOP is the most common form of secondary osteoporosis. This serious condition is presently treated with glucocorticoid treatment, which increases fracture risk within the first three months of beginning treatment. Prolia, if approved for the treatment of GIOP, can cater to an expanded patient population and drive sales higher.Prolia is a key revenue generator for Amgen and is witnessing market share gains in both the United States and international markets. In the first half of 2017, the drug generated sales of $930 million, up 17% year over year.Amgen’s shares have rallied 26.9% this year so far, better than the industry’s growth of 14.1% so far this year.Currently, Amgen holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

758,VRTX,"Biogen’s (BIIB  -  Free Report) third quarter results surpassed both top-and bottom-line expectations. Meanwhile, Gilead’s (GILD  -  Free Report) CAR T therapy gained earlier-than-expected FDA approval. Alexion (ALXN  -  Free Report) also got a regulatory boost with the FDA expanding the label of the company’s flagship product, Soliris.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesBiogen Beats on All Fronts: Although Biogen’s third quarter results were better than expected with the company surpassing both earnings and revenue expectations, shares were down 3.9% on concerns regarding the company’s multiple sclerosis franchise sales as well as U.S. sales of its recently launched spinal muscular atrophy (“SMA”) treatment, Spinraza. Spinraza U.S. sales were $198 million in the third quarter, more or less flat from second quarter sales of $195 million though the company reported a 75% increase in the number of patients on therapy in the United States compared to the end of the second quarter. However, second quarter sales included inventory buildup of $30 million (Read more: Biogen Tops Q3 Earnings & Sales, Spinraza Sales Up).Biogen has gained 11.3% year to date, outperforming the industry’s 8.2% rally.Gilead CAR T Therapy Yescarta Approved: Gilead’s Yescarta, which became a part of the company’s portfolio following the $11.9 billion Kite Pharma acquisition, gained FDA approval for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma after two or more lines of systemic therapy. This makes Yescarta the first chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR T) therapy to gain approval for use in this patient population.Yescarta is the second gene therapy to gain approval in the United States, the first being Novartis’s Kymriah. Both treatments come with a Boxed Warning regarding the risks of cytokine release syndrome (“CRS”) and neurologic toxicities.Yescarta’s approval is a major boost for Gilead which is currently facing declining sales from its hepatitis C virus (“HCV”) franchise. According to information provided by the company, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma (“NHL”) - about 7,500 patients with refractory DLBCL are eligible for CAR T therapy every year. Yescarta represents a new treatment option for these patients who have run out of treatment options and face a poor prognosis. Yescarta will be launched with a list price of $373,000 in the United States and is currently under review in the EU where a response is expected in the first half of 2018 (Read more: Gilead CAR-T Therapy Yescarta Clinches FDA Approval).Gilead also announced phase II results on its investigational treatment for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (""NASH""). The company said that the higher dose (20 mg) of GS-0976, an oral ACC inhibitor, achieved significant reductions in buildup of fat in the liver and a noninvasive marker of fibrosis (TIMP-1) compared to placebo. However, statistical significance was not achieved for other parameters like liver stiffness (by FibroScan and MRE), serum ALT and PIII-NP, a serum marker of fibrogenesis. Meanwhile, differences between the lower dose (5 mg) of GS-0976 and placebo were not statistically significant.Celgene Hit by Crohn’s Disease Study Discontinuation: Celgene’s (CELG  -  Free Report) shares were down 10.8% on news that the company will be discontinuing studies (phase III REVOLVE study and the extension study (SUSTAIN)) being conducted with its investigational Crohn’s disease drug, GED-0301 (mongersen). The decision was based on a recommendation from the Data Monitoring Committee in October following an interim futility analysis. No meaningful safety imbalances were observed in the analysis.Celgene also said that it will wait to review the full dataset from the phase II ulcerative colitis study on GED-0301 before deciding the path forward. The company will not be initiating the phase III DEFINE study for Crohn’s disease (Read more: Celgene Down on Discontinued Crohn's Disease Drug Study).AbbVie Announces Immuno-Therapy Focused Deals: AbbVie (ABBV  -  Free Report) announced a couple of deals this week. While one deal is focused on immuno-neurology, the other is focused on immuno-oncology.The immuno-neurology deal will see AbbVie collaborating with Alector for the use of the latter’s immuno-neurology discovery platform for innovative new therapies for Alzheimer's disease and other neurological disorders.Immuno-neurology, a rapidly evolving scientific area, is focused on harnessing the power of the immune system to attack neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's disease.While development and commercialization costs as well as profits will be shared equally by the companies, Alector will get an upfront payment of $205 million and a potential, future equity investment of up to $20 million.Meanwhile, the immuno-oncology deal will see AbbVie teaming up with Harpoon Therapeutics for the use of Harpoon's tri-specific T-cell activating construct (TriTAC) platform with AbbVie's research-stage immuno-oncology targets to develop cancer therapeutics (Read more: AbbVie Inks Immuno-Oncology Deal with Harpoon Therapeutics).Label Expansion for Alexion’s Soliris: The FDA granted approval to Alexion for the use of its flagship product, Soliris (eculizumab) in adult patients with generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) who are AchR antibody-positive. Soliris, already approved in the United States for serious ultra-rare disorders like paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (“PNH”) and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS), brought in sales of $1.6 billion in the first half of the year.

759,VRTX,"The third-quarter reporting cycle is in full swing. Corporate earnings have been reassuring so far this quarter and we expect the momentum to continue going ahead.As of Oct 20, 2017, 87 S&P 500 members, accounting for 24.7% of the index’s total market capitalization, have reported results, according to Earnings Preview.Total earnings of these 87 index members were up 9.4% from the year-ago quarter on a 7.3% improvement in revenues. The growth in revenues is impressive, ahead of the previous quarter’s growth of 4.4% and significantly higher than the 12-quarter average of 1.1%. The beat ratio was 71.3% for earnings and 70.1% for revenues. More than half of the 87 companies have beaten both EPS and revenue estimates.Per the report, total earnings of the S&P 500 companies in the third quarter are expected to grow 2.6% year over year on 5% higher revenues. Meanwhile, the broader Medical sector (includes drug, biotech as well as Medical Device companies) is expected to record year-over-year growth of 4.8% in revenues and 2.2% in earnings in Q3.Only two big names in the biotech/pharma sector have reported thus far — Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) and Swiss-based Novartis AG (NVS  -  Free Report). J&J’s Q3 results were better than expected and the company raised its sales and profit outlook for this year as well. Novartis also beat estimates for both revenues and earnings this quarter.Let’s take a look at three pharma/biotech companies that are set to report third-quarter results on Oct 25.Amgen Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report)Amgen, which is scheduled to release earnings after market closes, had delivered a positive earnings surprise of 5.83% last quarter. Amgen beat expectations in the last four quarters with an average positive surprise of 5.85%.For this quarter, Amgen has an Earnings ESP of -0.41% and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). This does not conclusively show that Amgenis likely to beat estimates this quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $3.09 per share. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Higher demand for Amgen’s new drugs is expected to offset lower sales of its mature brands. The company’s key drug, Neulasta, is facing competition from newer cancer therapies. The threat of biosimilars also lurks as several companies are looking to launch generic version of the drug.

Moreover, the newly launched respiratory drugs are expected to offset declining sales of Seretide, Advair and Avodart. Meanwhile, the slowdown in consumer segment due to market conditions and the impact of divestures is expected to continue. (Read More: Glaxo Q3 Earnings: Will it Deliver a Beat Yet Again?)Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (VRTX  -  Free Report)The company, which specially focuses on cystic fibrosis (""CF""), will report results tomorrow after market closes. In the last quarter, Vertex delivered a positive earnings surprise of 11.43%. The company came up with an average positive earnings surprise of 17.91% in the trailing four quarters. The company has an Earnings ESP of +7.24% and a Zacks Rank #3, indicating a likely positive surprise. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 37 cents per share.The approval for two label expansions of CF drug, Kalydeco, in the United States in May and August has broadened the patient population, which can drive sales of the drug. Moreover, the re-imbursement agreements in Ireland and Italy for Orkambi are also a positive. (Read More: Is a Beat in the Cards for Vertex in Q3 Earnings?)Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

760,VRTX,"Equifax Inc. (EFX  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 26. Last quarter, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 2.13%. Notably, Equifax outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters with an average positive earnings surprise of 4.02%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderEquifax posted better-than-expected results for the first quarter. Earnings and revenues both recorded year-over-year growth.In a recent development, Equifax entered into a definitive agreement to acquire ID Watchdog.  Further, the company expanded its strategic alliance with BizEquity, a global leader of business valuation knowledge and big data. The moves are aimed at boosting Equifax’s capabilities to serve its customers better.We believe that management’s efforts, such as strategic initiatives for product innovation, expansion of data assets through acquisitions and continuous share gains in North America, should act as tailwinds. Moreover, the company’s strong correlation with the consumer and financial markets along with exposure in the U.S. and Europe are likely to propel growth, moving ahead.However, we expect the company’s investments in new initiatives to weigh on its upcoming quarterly earnings. Additionally, uncertainty surrounding IT spending and the strengthening U.S. dollar are some concerns. Moreover, increasing competition from the likes of Fiserv (FISV  -  Free Report) and Total System Services are the other factors likely to affect earnings in the near term.Equifax, Inc.

761,VRTX,"F5 Networks Inc. (FFIV  -  Free Report) is set to report third-quarter 2017 results on Jul 26. Last quarter, the company posted a negative earnings surprise of 3.95%. Notably, F5 Networks outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters with an average positive earnings surprise of 1.17%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors to ConsiderF5 Networks reported dismal second-quarter fiscal 2017 results with both the bottom line and top line missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, year-over-year comparisons on both counts were favorable.It is worth mentioning that the company’s GBB pricing strategy and its BIG-IQ platform remain tailwinds. Revenue growth seems to be steady and was positively impacted by strength across all its business segments along with higher software revenues.We believe that the company’s product refreshes will boost revenues, going forward. Moreover, the initiatives are expected to expand its total addressable market and result in client wins.Better execution and focus on enterprise and service providers have placed F5 Networks well in the application delivery controller market.

762,VRTX,"We expect Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (VRTX  -  Free Report) to beat expectations when it reports its second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 26, after the market closes.Year to date, Vertex’s shares have soared 116.3% while the industry has recorded an increase of 11.2%.Vertex’s track record has been impressive so far. The company delivered positive earnings surprises in three and missed expectations in one of the last four quarters. The average positive earnings surprise for the last four quarters is 406.25%. In the last reported quarter, Vertex posted a positive surprise of 225%.Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated Price and EPS SurpriseVertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise | Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up for this quarter.Factors at PlaySales of Vertex’s both cystic fibrosis (CF) drugs — Kalydeco & Orkambi — rose in the first quarter. We expect this positive trend to continue in the second as well.In May 2017, Kalydeco gained an FDA approval for use in patients 2 and older who have one of 23 residual function mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. Over 900 people in the U.S. have one of these mutations. Following the approval, Vertex upped its Kalydeco 2017 revenue guidance to $740-$770 million. We expect this expanded indication to boost Kalydeco sales in the second quarter.Orkambi’s sales growth will be dependent on reimbursement discussions in Europe in 2017. Last week, Vertex announced that it has struck a re-imbursement agreement in Italy for Orkambi, thereby making the medicine more accessible in the country. Though the reimbursement agreement will not be beneficial in the second quarter, it should contribute to sales in the second half of the year. In the first quarter, the company had also mentioned that if it gains reimbursement in France this year, it would contribute significantly to revenue growth this year.Vertex is also evaluating some next-generation CFTR correctors (VX-152, VX-440, VX-659 and VX-445) as part of a triple combination with tezacaftor and ivacaftor.Data from VX-152 and VX-440 phase II and VX-659 phase I triple combination studies presented earlier this week, have showed that all three combinations led to a pronounced improvement in lung function. Phase II study on VX-659 is expected to be initiated in early Aug. Phase II studies on the fourth next-generation corrector, VX-445 (triple combination with tezacaftor and ivacaftor), are already going on. Data from VX-445 and VX-659 phase II studies are expected in early 2018. Thereafter, upon discussion with regulatory agencies, Vertex will initiate its pivotal studies on one or more of these triple combination regimens in the first half of 2018.If the triple-combo regimes are successful, Vertex can address a significantly larger CF patient population.Investor focus at the call will be on these triple combination CF regimens, crucial for long-term growth of Vertex.However, operating expenses are likely to shoot up as Vertex expands its pipeline.What Our Model IndicatesOur proven model shows that Vertex is likely to beat estimates this quarterbecause it has the right combination of two key ingredients. For astock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate (earnings of 10 cents) and the Zacks Consensus Estimate (earnings of 6 cents), stands at +66.7%. This is a leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Vertex currently flaunts a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). So its desirable combination makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Conversely, we caution against the Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some health care stocks that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Gilead Sciences, Inc.

763,VRTX,"Xilinx Inc. (XLNX  -  Free Report) is slated to report first-quarter 2018 results on Jul 26. Last quarter, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 5.56%. Notably, Xilinx outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the preceding four quarters with an average positive earnings surprise of 8.89%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors to ConsiderKeeping its earnings streak alive for the 12th successive quarter, Xilinx reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter results, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both counts. Further, both the top line and bottom line increased year over year.Rising demand for 28-nm, 20-nm and 16-nm nodes, driven by higher wireless deployments and strength in the wired communication segment, are expected to remain growth drivers. The company’s product launches are likely to further aid revenues.We are also encouraged by Xilinx’s endeavor to return shareholder value through continued share buybacks and dividends. These investor-friendly initiatives not only boost earnings but also increase investors’ confidence and loyalty.However, a slowdown in the Chinese economy, along with economic weakness in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region, could adversely affect Xilinx’s near-term results.

764,VRTX,"Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2017 results on Jul 27, before the opening bell. Last quarter, the company beat earnings estimates by 16.7%.Bristol-Myers Squibb Company Price and EPS Surprise Bristol-Myers Squibb Company Price and EPS Surprise | Bristol-Myers Squibb Company QuoteBristol-Myers’ stock has lost 26.4% in the past year, underperforming the industry, which remained flat in that period.Bristol-Myers has a decent track record so far. The company’s earnings beat estimates in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 8.39%. Will Bristol-Myers surpass expectations this time as well?Let's see how things are shaping up for this quarter.Factors to Impact This QuarterBristol-Myers’ high-profile immuno-oncology drug, Opdivo, should continue to drive the company’s top line in the to-be-reported quarter. Opdivo’s U.S. sales are driven by the melanoma, second-line non-small-cell lung cancer and renal cell carcinoma indications.Recent label expansions into the classical Hodgkin lymphoma and head and neck cancer indications should boost the drug’s sales.  However, the lung-cancer market in the U.S. became more competitive in 2016 due to the entry of Tecentriq.Bristol-Myers expects the second-line lung cancer business to be under competitive pressure. As a result, sales of the drug in the U.S. market is projected be flat in 2017. Although the first quarter saw some stability in the second-line lung cancer, the recent FDA approval of Merck’s (MRK  -  Free Report) Keytruda for the first-line treatment of metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC will further impact sales.On the other hand, the virology business is expected to decline significantly in 2017 due to competition from Epclusa. The HIV business continues to face competitive pressure. Recent launches by other companies in the same space are expected to further impact the Sustiva franchise.Bristol-Myers is also looking to diversify its portfolio with the development of BMS-986036 for NASH.On a positive note, Bristol-Myers raised its earnings expectations for 2017 concurrent with the first-quarter results. The company now projects earnings in the range of $2.85–$3.00 per share (old guidance: $2.70 to $2.90). Revenues are expected to grow in mid- to single-digit range due to strong trends across the business, particularly in key products like Opdivo, Eliquis and Yervoy. Gross margins are projected to decline as the year progresses and are estimated in the 72–73% range.  R&D expenses are expected to increase in the low-double digit range.In the second-quarter earnings call, investors are expected to focus on the company’s performance and label expansion efforts for Opdivo, along with updates on business development activities.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Bristol-Myers is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Unfortunately, that is not the case here, as elaborated below.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Bristol-Myers is 0.0% since both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 73 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Bristol-Myers currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 which increases the predictive power of ESP.

765,VRTX,"Pharma and biotech stocks started 2017 on a strong note with this part of the market remaining in favor as the year progresses. So far this year, the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index and the NYSE ARCA Pharmaceutical Index are up 25.6% and 14.6%, respectively.With investors being more comfortable with the drug pricing scenario, focus has shifted to the fundamentals of the sector. Although the drug pricing issue will remain a headwind, expectations are that steps taken by the Trump administration to drive down drug prices will not be as draconian as previously expected.  Deregulation and increased competition seem to be some of the ways that will be used to control drug prices. The FDA is working to lower healthcare costs by speeding up the development of next-generation treatments, especially for rare diseases or targeted cancer therapies and is also working on clearing up a backlog of orphan drug applications.The FDA has approved far more drugs this year than it did in the whole of 2016. Key approvals this year include Novartis’s (NVS  -  Free Report) Kymriah (the first gene therapy in the United States), Lilly’s Verzenio (advanced or metastatic breast cancer), Gilead’s (GILD  -  Free Report) Vosevi (hepatitis C virus), Puma’s Nerlynx (to reduce the risk of breast cancer returning), J&J’s Tremfya (moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis), Regeneron/Sanofi’s Kevzara (rheumatoid arthritis), Roche’s multiple sclerosis treatment, Ocrevus, Regeneron and Sanofi’s eczema treatment, Dupixent, Tesaro’s PARP inhibitor, Zejula, and BioMarin’s Brineura (treatment of a specific form of Batten disease) among others. Quite a few of these drugs have blockbuster potential.Meanwhile, some other factors that should continue having a positive impact on pharma and biotech stocks are new product sales ramp up, R&D success and innovation, strong results, a higher number of FDA approvals and continued strong performance from legacy products.According to the Zacks Earnings Trends report, the medical sector, which has been among the better performing sectors over the last several quarters, is expected to record earnings growth of 1% on revenue growth of 4.7% in the third quarter.Given this scenario and with medical sector earnings round the corner, it would make sense to look at some pharma and biotech stocks that are expected to report a positive earnings surprise in the quarter.Investing in such stocks could prove beneficial for investors as an earnings beat usually leads to significant share price appreciation.5 Drug Stocks to Keep an Eye on This Earnings SeasonWith the help of the Zacks Stock Screener, we have zeroed-in on five pharma and biotech stocks that sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), #2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold) and have a positive Earnings ESP. Earnings ESP is a very valuable tool for investors looking for stocks that are most likely to beat earnings estimates. Moreover, adding a Zacks Rank of #1, 2 or 3 has produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. While you can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here, you can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Pfizer Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report): Pfizer is focused on the development and commercialization of a wide range of medicines and vaccines as well consumer health care products. The company has surpassed earnings expectations in each of the first two quarters of 2017. Key revenue drivers include Ibrance, Eliquis and Xeljanz. Pfizer, which expects 2017 revenues to be affected by about $2.5 billion due to loss of exclusivities (LOEs), is working on bringing new products to market to make up for lost sales. The company has 15 potential blockbusters lined up for the next 5 years with about half of these potentially by 2020. Focus also remains on growing new products like Ibrance, Eliquis and Xeljanz. Meanwhile, the impact of LOEs should continue declining in the coming years (about $2 billion in 2018 as well as 2019, $1 billion - $2 billion in 2020; $1 billion in 2021, and $0.5 billion or less from 2022 to 2025).Pfizer, a Zacks Rank #2 stock, carries a VGM Score of B. The VGM Score is a useful tool that allows investors to gain an insight into a stock’s strengths and weaknesses.Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2 offer the best upside potential.This company, which will be reporting third quarter results on October 31, has an earnings ESP of +0.84%.Eli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report): Lilly, which has a strong presence in the pharmaceuticals as well as animal health segments, is slated to report third quarter 2017 results on October 24. This Zacks Rank #3 stock has an earnings ESP of +4.46% for the third quarter. Lilly surpassed earnings expectations in the first two quarters of 2017. Although the company is facing challenges including generic competition, new products should drive results. Lilly has several important pipeline catalysts lined up for the coming quarters as well. Estimated earnings growth for the current year is 17.9%.Lilly has gained 18.4% year to date, compared to the 18% rally of the industry it belongs to.Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX  -  Free Report): Vertex, a key player in the cystic fibrosis (CF) market, surpassed earnings expectations in three of the last four quarters with an average surprise of 17.9%. The company holds a strong position in the CF market with two products, Orkambi and Kalydeco, in its portfolio. Early in August, Vertex had said that it expects its CF franchise to deliver revenues of $1.87 billion - $2.1 billion in 2017 including Orkambi revenues of $1.1 billion - $1.3 billion.The company is working on expanding its CF portfolio and is currently seeking both FDA and EMA approval for a tezacaftor/ivacaftor combination. With the FDA granting priority review, a response should be out by Feb 28, 2018.Vertex, a Zacks Rank #1 stock, has gained 111.1% year to date, substantially outperforming the 13.9% rally of the industry it belongs to. The company, which is expected to report third quarter results on October 24, has an Earnings ESP of +2.56% for the quarter.Biogen Inc.

766,VRTX,"Looking for a stock that might be in a good position to beat earnings at its next report? Consider Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (VRTX  -  Free Report), a firm in the Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry, which could be a great candidate for another beat.This company has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. In fact, in these reports, VRTX has beaten estimates by at least 10% in both cases, suggesting it has a nice short-term history of crushing expectations.Earnings in FocusTwo quarters ago, VRTX was expected to post 29 cents per share, while it actually produced 41 cents per share, a beat of 41.4%. Meanwhile, for the most recent quarter, the company looked to deliver 35 cents per share, when it actually saw 39 cents per share instead, representing a 11.4% positive surprise.Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise | Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated QuoteThanks in part to this history, recent estimates have been moving higher for Vertex Pharmaceuticals. In fact, the Earnings ESP for VRTX is positive, which is a great sign of a coming beat.After all, the Zacks Earnings ESP compares the most accurate estimate to the broad consensus, looking to find stocks that have seen big revisions as of late, suggesting that analysts have recently become more bullish on the company’s earnings prospects. This is the case for VRTX, as the firm currently has a Zacks Earnings ESP of +2.56%, so another beat could be around the corner.This is particularly true when you consider that VRTX has a great Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), which can be a harbinger of outperformance and a signal for a strong earnings profile. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.When you add this solid Zacks Rank to a positive Earnings ESP, a positive earnings surprise happens nearly 70% of the time, so it seems pretty likely that VRTX could see another beat at its next report, especially if recent trends are any guide.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

768,VRTX,"Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report) will be reporting second-quarter 2017 earnings on Jul 28, before market opens. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 6.02%.Merck’s performance has been pretty impressive, with the company exceeding earnings expectations consistently. The average positive earnings surprise over the last four quarters is 4.36%Merck’s shares rose 6.9% this year so far, comparing unfavourably with 12.1% increase for the industry.Factors to ConsiderMerck’s new products like Keytruda (cancer), Zepatier (HCV) and Bridion (sugammadex) injection may drive the top line this quarter.We believe Keytruda’s sales will likely be driven by strong uptake, launch in new countries and expansion into additional indications, especially first-line NSCLC. In Mar/Apr 2017, Keytruda received FDA and EU approval for refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) - the first Keytruda approval for hematologic malignancy indication. In May, Keytruda was approved as first-line combination therapy for lung cancer – its first FDA approval as a combination therapy. The expanded indications, especially as a combination therapy, may add to Keytruda’s sales this quarter. This apart, continued strength in melanoma indication and rapid penetration of head and neck cancer indication might boost Keytruda sales.In the last couple of months, there were a series of regulatory approvals for the label expansion of Keytruda like advanced bladder cancer. We expect an update from management on the commercialization plans for the same at the conference call.At the first quarter conference call, management had said that it was working on securing reimbursement for Keytruda in first as well as second-line NSCLC indication outside U.S. and lung cancer sales will become a much larger contributor outside the country as the year progresses. We expect an update on this at the conference call.Meanwhile, ongoing launches globally are likely to support Zepatier’s sales.However, the company will continue to face headwinds in the form of genericization, increasing competition and the negative impact of currency exchange.Sales of Remicade (lost exclusivity in Europe and facing stiff biosimilar competition in the region), Nasonex (generic version launched in the U.S. in Mar 2016), Cubicin (lost patent protection in the U.S. in Jun 2016) and Zetia (lost market exclusivity in the U.S. in Dec 2016) will likely decline in the quarter.Sluggish growth of the integrase class and continued competitor dynamics in the U.S. and Europe may continue to affect Isentress’ sales.Investors focus will remain on the performance of Merck’s DPP-4 inhibitor – Januvia. Pricing pressure hurt sales of the Januvia/Janumet franchise in the first quarter. It remains to be seen if the trends improved in the second quarter.The vaccines and animal health franchises should also boost sales this quarter.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Merck is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Its Earnings ESP is 0.00% as both the Most Accurate estimate as well as the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 87 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Merck’s Zacks Rank #2 increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings beat.We caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Merck & Company, Inc.

770,VRTX,"Tapping stocks that come up with solid earnings is a common practice. But instead of picking them post earnings, investing in those that are like to beat market expectations may increase your gains manifolds.Why Is Positive Earnings Surprise So Important?Historically, stocks of companies with solid quarterly earnings (on a nominal basis) fall if they miss or just come in line with market expectations. After all, a 20% earnings rise (though it looks good apparently) doesn’t tell you if earnings growth has been exhibiting a decelerating trend. If that is the case, the company’s fundamentals are in serious question.There is also the factor of seasonal fluctuation. If a company’s Q1 is seasonally weak and Q4 is strong, then it is likely to report a sequential earnings decline. In a such case, growth rates are ambiguous while judging the company’s true health.On the other hand, Wall Street analysts study companies’ financials and initiatives to forecast earnings. They in fact club their insights and the company’s guidance to derive an earnings estimate. So, outperforming that estimate is almost equivalent to beating the company’s own expectation as well as market perception. And if the company manages to surpass earnings by a wide margin, it typically drives the stock higher right after the release.How to Find Out Those Gems?Since it is hard to predict if a company will beat or miss in the upcoming earnings season, investors can check its earnings surprise history. A notable track record generally acts as a tailwind. It revs up chances of beating estimates in the next release too as investors expect the company to use the same old trick to come ahead of expectations, or is smart enough to pull off a beat in the next release.The Winning StrategyIn order to shortlist stocks that are likely to come up with an earnings surprise, we chose the following as our primary screening parameters.Last EPS Surprise greater than or equal to 10%: Stocks delivering positive surprise in the last quarter tend to surprise again.Average EPS Surprise in the last four quarters greater than 20%: We lifted the bar for outperformance slight higher by setting the average earnings surprise for the last four quarters at 20%.Average EPS Surprise in the last two quarters greater than 20%: This points to a more consistent surprise history and makes the case for another surprise even stronger.In addition, we place a few other criteria that push up the chance of a positive surprise.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Only companies with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) rating can get through.Earnings ESP greater than zero: A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank of #1, 2 or 3 for an earnings beat to happen, as per our proven model.In order to zero in on those that have long-term growth potential and high trading liquidity we have added the following parameters too:Next 3–5 Years Estimated EPS Growth (Per Year) greater than 10%: Solid expected earnings growth exhibits the stock’s long-term growth prospects.Average 20-day Volume greater than 100,000: High trading volume implies that the stocks have adequate liquidity.A handful of criteria has narrowed down the universe from over 7,700 stocks to around seven.Here are five out of seven stocks that passed the screen:Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (VRTX  -  Free Report): The company is a developer and marketer of small molecule drugs. The stock belongs to a Zacks Industry Rank in the top 46%. It has a Zacks Rank #2.AGCO Corporation (AGCO  -  Free Report): The company is engaged in the manufacturer and distribution of farm equipment, machinery and replacement parts in the United States and Canada.

771,VRTX,"Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc.(SRPT  -  Free Report) reported narrower-than-expected loss in the second quarter of 2017. The biotech also increased its 2017 sales outlook for Exondys 51, a treatment for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and its only marketed drug. Shares were up almost 15% in after-hours trading.So far this year, Sarepta’s shares are up 24.2%. This compares favorably with 10.5% increase registered by the Zacks classified Biomed/Genetics industry during this period.Narrower LossSarepta incurred a loss of 65 cents per share in the second quarter of 2017, narrower than the year-ago loss of $1.35 as well as the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 92 cents.Loss per share excludes restructuring costs and gain from asset sale but includes the impact of share-based compensation expenses.Quarterly DetailsSarepta received a huge boost with the FDA’s approval of Exondys 51, its only marketed drug and also the first DMD treatment to gain approval in the U.S. The drug is under review in the EU. In the second quarter, Sarepta recorded revenues of $35 million, up 115% sequentially, primarily attributable to sales of Exondys 51. Revenues beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate. In the prior-year quarter, Sarepta had recognized no revenues.Adjusted research and development (R&D) expenses were $34.6 million in the second quarter, down 16.4% year over year, due to lower manufacturing expenses owing to the capitalization of inventory following the approval of Exondys 51 by the FDA. This was partly offset by increased expenses in preclinical studies on PPMO platform and other follow-on exons and increased patient enrollment in ongoing clinical studies. However, it excludes a one-time payment of $22 million to Summit Therapeutics plc (SMMT  -  Free Report) for completing enrolment in a phase II study evaluating utrophin modulator, ezutromid.Adjusted selling, general & administrative (SG&A) expenses were $25.4 million, up 92.1% year over year, due to increased legal fees and commercial initiatives, compensation and other personnel expenses.Both R&D and SG&A expenses exclude the impact of restructuring costs and share-based compensation expenses.Subsequent to the quarter in Jul 2017, Sarepta launched a Managed Access Program along with UK-based Clinigen to ensure availability of Exondys 51 to DMD patients in certain geographies outside the U.S. The company also appointed Douglas S. Ingram as its new President and CEO. Moreover, it also signed a gene therapy research collaboration agreement with Genethon to jointly develop treatments for DMD.Earlier this week, the company announced that it hassettled a global patent litigation with BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. (BMRN  -  Free Report) regarding the exclusive license on a patent pertaining to exon skipping technology used in DMD therapies. If Sarepta hadn’t settled with BioMarin, the latter could have prevented Sarepta from commercializing Exondys 51 in several jurisdictions.OutlookBased on sales trends witnessed in the second quarter, Sarepta updated its guidance for Exondys 51 sales to $125 million to $130 million in 2017, higher than its prior guidance of $95 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 sales is pegged at $103.51 million.The biotech company raised its outlook for Exondys 51 for 2017 based on increasing market penetration, start forms from physicians and additional new patients in the second quarter.Meanwhile Sarepta is looking to build its own DMD pipeline beyond Exondys 51 by developing other exon-skipping treatments. Sarepta has about seven exon-skipping candidates in its pipeline that could treat 75%–80% of the DMD population. The company expects to present dystrophin data from 4053-101 study by the end of 2017.Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc.

773,VRTX,"Gilead Sciences Inc. (GILD  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 26, after the market closes. Last quarter, the company beat expectations by 0.92%.Gilead Sciences, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Gilead Sciences, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Gilead Sciences, Inc. QuoteGilead’s track record is pretty mixed, with the company beating estimates in three of the last four and missing in the other one. Overall, the company recorded an average positive earnings surprise of 3.52%.Shares of Gilead have moved up 1.5% in the year so far, underperforming the Zacks classified Medical-Biomedical and Genetics industry’s gain of 10.5%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this biotech major for this announcement.Earnings WhispersOur proven model shows that Gilead is likely to beat on earnings estimates this quarter. This is because it has the right combination of two key ingredients, a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold).Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is +3.32%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is $2.18 while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged lower at $2.11. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Gilead currently carries a Zacks Rank #3. The combination of Zacks Rank #3 and a positive ESP makes us confident of an earnings beat.Conversely, Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Factors at PlayConcurrent with the first-quarter earnings call, Gilead reiterated its guidance for annual guidance for 2017.  Gilead expects net product sales in the range of $22.5–$24.5 billion. Non-HCV product sales are projected between $15 billion and $15.5 billion.  HCV product sales are projected between $7.5 billion and $9.0 billion.Strong performance by HIV and other antiviral product sales driven by continued uptake of its tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) based products – Genvoya, Descovy and Odefsey continue to boost sales. We expect the trend to continue in the second quarter as well. Genvoya has already become the most prescribed regimen for both treatment-naïve and switch patients since its launch.By the end of first-quarter 2017, the TAF-based regimens made up 42% of Gilead's HIV prescription volume in the treatment market. Strong uptake for Truvada for use in the pre-exposure prophylaxis setting is also expected to boost sales.  However, Gilead will lose exclusivity for Viread in 2017 in some countries outside the U.S. which might impact sales.However, the HCV franchise continues to be under competitive and pricing pressure leading to a massive decline in Harvoni and Sovaldi sales in 2016. Harvoni and Sovaldi has been facing competition from AbbVie’s (ABBV  -  Free Report) Viekira Pak and Viekira XR among others. Higher discounts and payer mix continue to impact sales adversely. Total HCV treatment starts in the U.S. were an estimated 231,000 in 2016, approximately 25,000 less than 2015. The company expects a further decline in patients starts in 2017.On a positive note, the HCV portfolio received a major boost when Epclusa gained approval in 2016 to become the first and only all-oral, pan-genotypic, STR consisting of Sovaldi and velpatasvir (an NS5A inhibitor), for the treatment of adults with genotype 1–6 chronic HCV infection. Initial uptake of Epclusa has been encouraging while formulary reviews are on track. The recently approved HBV drug Vemlidy is also expected to start contributing to the top line. The FDA recently approved Vosevi (Sovaldi, velpatasvir 100 mg/voxilaprevir 100 mg) tablets as a single-tablet regimen (STR) for the re-treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in adults with genotype 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6, previously treated with an NS5A inhibitor-containing regimen, or with genotype 1a or 3 previously treated with a Sovaldi-containing regimen without an NS5A inhibitor.During the second-quarter call, investors are likely to keep an eye on Gilead’s performance while pipeline updates will also be keenly awaited. Focus would also be on the performance of Epclusa and TAF-based regimens.Other Stocks Poised to Beat EstimatesHere are some other health care stocks that you may want to consider, as our model shows that they too have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (VRTX  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +66.7% and a Zacks Rank #1.

775,VRTX,"Israel-based generic drug maker, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited (TEVA  -  Free Report), saw its shares decline 9.4% last week with the company suffering a fresh setback in the form of FDA approval of a generic version of the company’s top-selling branded drug, Copaxone (multiple sclerosis). Mylan NV (MYL  -  Free Report) gained FDA approval for its generic version of the 40 mg (thrice weekly) dosage as well as the once-daily 20 mg formulation of Copaxone. With Mylan being among the first applicants to challenge the 40 mg patent, the company could enjoy 180 days of exclusivity. Mylan has launched both products. Mylan also gained approval for the 40 mg dose in the EU.The FDA approval of generic Copaxone is a major blow for Teva which is currently facing a whole lot of challenges. Teva issued a statement saying that the launch of the 40 mg formulation before the final resolution of pending patent infringement lawsuits with Mylan will be treated as an “at-risk” launch – this means Mylan would have to pay significant damages if the court upholds the patents protecting the drug.Copaxone brought in total sales of $1.99 billion in the first half of 2017. At the end of the second quarter of 2017, Copaxone 40 mg accounted for more than 85% of total Copaxone prescriptions in the United States.The entry of the 40 mg formulation and the entry of a second generic version of the 20 mg formulation (Sandoz and Momenta have been on the market for quite a while with Glatopa, a generic version of the 20 mg dose) is expected to cut Teva’s 4Q earnings by at least 25 cents per share. Additional details should be out when the company announces third quarter results on November 2. The entry of generic Copaxone just adds to the existing list of problems being faced by Teva.Generic pricing erosion remains a huge issue for generic companies like Teva. The sharp decline in generic drug prices, while a blessing for patients, is proving to be a major challenge for generic drugmakers as well as drug distributors.Consolidation in the industry has increased the ability to negotiate lower prices for generic drugs leading to increasing price erosion and decreasing volume. Moreover, the FDA is speeding up the approval of generic drugs which means more competition, increasing price cuts and decreasing volume. Teva said that price erosion was around 6% in the second quarter and is expected to increase to high-single digits over the remainder of the year. All these headwinds will persist for the U.S. Generics unit into the near future, resulting in lower revenue and profit in this segment in 2018 and potentially 2019.Meanwhile, the company said that it does not expect any earnings contribution from its businesses in Venezuela given the significant devaluation of the Venezuelan currency. Teva also cut its dividend by 75%.Teva has many challenges ahead – paying down debt, divesting non-core businesses to increase focus on core areas and generate cash, delivering on the pipeline and getting the U.S. generics business back on track.The company has been working on addressing these issues and recently announced the appointment of a new CEO (Read more: Why Did Teva Pharmaceuticals Stock Soar Today?). Teva has also made significant progress in the divestment of non-core businesses. However, the entry of Copaxone 40 mg is a major setback for the company and it could well be a while before Teva is able to get back on track.Teva is a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) stock. The company has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings being revised 1.9% downward over the last 7 days while the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 has been revised 5.1% downward over the last 7 days. Teva has lost 56% of its value year to date versus the 20.5% decline of its industry.While Teva deals with these challenges, here is a look at five drug companies that sport a strong Zacks Rank and look well-positioned.Celgene Corporation (CELG  -  Free Report): Celgene is focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of innovative therapies for the treatment of cancer and inflammatory diseases. The company has several blockbuster products in its portfolio including Revlimid, Pomalyst, and Otezla.

The company has 15 potential blockbusters lined up for the next 5 years with about half of these potentially by 2020. Focus also remains on growing new products like Ibrance, Eliquis and Xeljanz. Meanwhile, the impact of LOEs should continue declining in the coming years (about $2 billion in 2018 as well as 2019, $1 billion - $2 billion in 2020; $1 billion in 2021, and $0.5 billion or less from 2022 to 2025).Pfizer, a Zacks Rank #2 stock, carries a VGM Score of B.Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report): Amgen, one of the most well-known names in the biotech industry, has a presence in the oncology/hematology, inflammation, nephrology, bone health and cardiovascular disease markets.

776,VRTX,"Companies like Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report) and Endocyte (ECYT  -  Free Report) were in the news with Amgen signing a deal with AbbVie (ABBV  -  Free Report) related to the entry of its biosimilar version of Humira and Endocyte signing an in-licensing deal which could prove to be transformational for the company.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesEndocyte Soars on In-Licensing Deal: Endocyte’s shares have shot up a whopping 317% following the company’s announcement that it has got an exclusive worldwide license for PSMA-617 from ABX GmbH. Endocyte said that it will quickly move 177Lu-PSMA-617 into phase III development. 177Lu-PSMA-617 is a radioligand therapeutic (“RLT”) that targets the prostate-specific membrane antigen (“PSMA”) present in about 80% of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).   The transformational deal provides Endocyte with the most advanced targeted radioligand therapy in development for prostate cancer, representing a market opportunity of more than $1 billion. The company hopes to start phase III development in the first half of 2018 and complete the program as early as 2020. The terms of the deal include a $12 million upfront payment as well as the issuance of 2 million shares to ABX plus a warrant for the purchase of up to 4 million additional shares of Endocyte common stock. ABX also stands to receive milestone payments of up to $160 million and tiered royalties starting in the mid-teens. Endocyte will bear all future development expenses (Read more: Endocyte Inks Deal For Prostate Cancer Candidate, Shares Up).AbbVie-Amgen Sign Deal Delaying Humira Biosimilar Entry: AbbVie has gained some breathing space by entering into a settlement agreement with Amgen related to biosimilar competition for AbbVie’s multi-billion dollar drug, Humira. Amgen, which gained FDA approval for Amjevita, its biosimilar version of Humira, has acknowledged the validity of AbbVie’s extensive intellectual property portfolio for Humira. According to the deal, the non-exclusive license for Humira will commence on Jan 31, 2023 in the United States and on different dates in other markets including Oct 16, 2018 in most countries in the EU. Amgen will also pay royalties.This agreement has removed a major overhang on AbbVie’s shares though the company is still facing a patent challenge from Boehringer Ingelheim, which gained approval for its biosimilar version of Humira, Cyltezo, in August.Humira generated sales of $8.8 billion in the first half of 2017 including $5.9 billion in the United States, which remains a key market for the drug. With Humira continuing to perform well, it will remain a major contributor to the top-line in the coming years. Moreover, the agreement gives AbbVie ample time to focus on developing its pipeline and launching new products that will help make up for the loss of revenues once biosimilar Humira enters the market. Expectations are high that AbbVie and Boehringer Ingelheim will announce a similar settlement agreement and dismiss all patent litigation.  While AbbVie is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, Amgen is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Ablynx Up on Positive Phase III Results: Ablynx’s shares shot up 23.3% on positive topline results from a late-stage study on caplacizumab, the company’s anti-von Willebrand factor (vWF) nanobody which is being developed for the treatment of acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (aTTP). Ablynx is currently seeking approval for caplacizumab in the EU and expects to submit a regulatory application in the United States in the first half of 2018. Caplacizumab has Fast Track designation in the United States for the treatment of aTTP and timely approval would make it the first therapeutic specifically indicated for the treatment of aTTP, an acute, life-threatening autoimmune blood clotting disorder.CytomX in Immuno-Oncology Deal with Amgen: CytomX Therapeutics (CTMX  -  Free Report) has entered into an immune-oncology focused strategic collaboration with Amgen for the development of a CytomX Probody T-cell engaging bispecific against the epidermal growth factor receptor (“EGFR”).While early development will be led by CytomX, Amgen will lead later development and commercialization. The companies will share global late-stage development costs. The deal will see CytomX getting an upfront payment of $40 million and issuing $20 million of common stock to Amgen. CytomX could also earn up to $455 million in development, regulatory and commercial milestones for the EGFR program. Global commercial activities will be led by Amgen with CytomX having the option to opt into a profit share in the United States and receive tiered, double-digit royalties on net product sales outside the United States.The agreement also covers up to three additional, undisclosed targets. If Amgen decides to pursue all these targets, CytomX could get up to an additional $950 million in upfront and milestone payments and high single-digit to mid-double digit royalty payments. CytomX will also receive the rights to an undisclosed preclinical T-cell engaging bispecific program from Amgen for which it will make milestone and royalty payments on any resulting products under this arrangement. We expect investors to react favorably to this deal.Regeneron, Sanofi Eczema Drug Gets EU Nod: Regeneron (REGN  -  Free Report) and partner Sanofi gained EU approval for their eczema treatment, Dupixent. This makes Dupixent the first targeted biologic to be approved for use in adults with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (“AD”) who are candidates for systemic therapy. Dupixent, approved in the United States earlier this year, has blockbuster potential and is being investigated for other indications as well including asthma, eosinophilic esophagitis and nasal polyps.Shares of Regeneron have gained 24.1% year to date, significantly outperforming the industry’s 15.4% rally.PerformanceMedical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % ReturnMedical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % ReturnThe Nasdaq Biotechnology Index gained almost 3% over the last five trading sessions.

777,VRTX,"Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (VRTX  -  Free Report) announced data from three studies wherein three different triple combination regimens were evaluated for the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF). These led to pronounced improvements in lung function. Shares of the company surged more than 25% in after-hours trading following the announcement of the positive data.So far this year, Vertex’s shares have significantly outperformed the Zacks classified Medical-Biomed/Genetics industry. The stock has gained 79.4% compared with an increase of 8.8% registered by the industry.Two phase II studies evaluated VX-152 (200mg q12h) or VX-440 (600mg q12h) and a phase I study evaluated VX-659, all three in combination with Kalydeco and tezacaftor for the treatment of CF patients with one F508del mutation and one minimal function mutation (F508del/Min). The primary endpoint of these studies was improvement in lung function measured by percent predicted forced expiratory volume in one second (ppFEV1). It measures the volume of air one can exhale in one second.All the studies met their primary endpoints. The study evaluating VX-152 showed a mean absolute improvement of 9.7% points in ppFEV1 from baseline through two weeks versus placebo. The study on VX-440 showed an absolute change of 12% points in ppFEV1 from baseline to the average of the week 4 measurements versus placebo. The VX-659 regimen achieved a mean improvement of 9.6% points from baseline compared to placebo.The data demonstrated the potential of the regimens to treat the underlying cause of CF in patients with severe and difficult-to-treat type of the disease rather than treating the symptoms. Also, the three different regimens were well tolerated in patients and most of the adverse events were mild to moderate in severity.The company is also evaluating VX-152 or VX-440 in patients with two copies of the F508del mutation who are already receiving tezacaftor and Kalydeco combination. The initial data showed improvements in mean absolute ppFEV1 of 7.3% and 9.5% points.Vertex fourth next-generation corrector under development is VX-445. A phase II triple combination (in combination with Kalydeco and tezacaftor) study on VX-445 is ongoing whereas the company expects to initiate phase II study on VX-659 early next month. Data from these studies are expected in early 2018. Thereafter, upon discussion with regulatory agencies, Vertex will initiate pivotal studies on one or more of these triple combination regimens in the first half of 2018.We remind investors that Vertex remains focused on CF treatments. The company has two CF drugs – Kalydeco & Orkambi – in the market. Orkambi and Kalydeco together are approved to treat approximately 40% of the 75,000 CF patients in North America, Europe and Australia. They generated revenues of $481 million in the first quarter of 2017 together, which was 22% higher than the year-ago period.On successful completion of these triple combination studies and subsequent approval, CF patients with minimal function mutations will also be eligible for treatment by Vertex’s portfolio of CF drugs. This should significantly boost Vertex’s sales.Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated Price and Consensus Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated Price and Consensus | Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated QuoteZacks Rank and Key PicksVertex currently carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Some other top-ranked stocks in the health care sector are Enzo Biochem, Inc. , Exelixis, Inc.

778,VRTX,"Key highlights this week include impressive data from Vertex’s (VRTX  -  Free Report) cystic fibrosis (CF) pipeline while companies like Gilead (GILD  -  Free Report) and Puma (PBYI  -  Free Report) got FDA approval for their hepatitis C virus (HCV) and breast cancer treatments, respectively.  Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesVertex CF Data Impresses: Vertex got a major boost with positive data on three different triple combination regimens in people with cystic fibrosis (CF) who have one F508del mutation and one minimal function mutation (F508del/Min). These are the first data to show the potential to treat the underlying cause of CF in these patients, who have a severe and difficult-to-treat type of the disease. The company is looking to start a pivotal program in the first half of 2018. Vertex’s shares were up significantly in pre-market trading.CRL for Amgen/UCB Osteoporosis Drug: Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report) and partner UCB got a Complete Response Letter (CRL) from the FDA for Evenity (romosozumab), their investigational treatment for postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. However, the CRL doesn’t come as a surprise considering the emergence of a new safety signal in a late-stage study (ARCH). Although Evenity met both the primary endpoints and the key secondary endpoint in the study, the companies said that an imbalance in positively adjudicated cardiovascular serious adverse events was observed.The FDA has asked the companies to include data from the ARCH study in the resubmission as well as data from the BRIDGE study in men with osteoporosis (Read more: Amgen Gets CRL for Osteoporosis Drug Evenity's BLA). Amgen is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock -- you can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.FDA Nod for Gilead HCV Drug: Gilead has added another drug to its hepatitis C virus (HCV) portfolio with the FDA granting approval to Vosevi, a single-tablet regimen for the re-treatment of adults with chronic HCV. Vosevi provides physicians with a new therapeutic option for their hardest-to-treat patients. However, Vosevi comes with a boxed warning regarding the risk of hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation in HCV/HBV co-infected patients -- this could limit uptake.Gilead’s HCV franchise, which was a major revenue generator, is under considerable strain due to new competition and pricing pressure. The company has underperformed the Zacks-categorized Medical-Biomedical/Genetics industry so far in 2017 with shares gaining 0.1% while the industry is up 8.9%.Puma Up on FDA Approval of Nerlynx: Puma gained FDA approval for its breast cancer treatment, Nerlynx (neratinib), which has blockbuster potential. Nerlynx, the first approved drug in Puma’s portfolio, is indicated for the extended adjuvant treatment of early-stage, HER2+ breast cancer, an aggressive type of tumor. This means that Nerlynx can be taken after an initial treatment so that the risk of the cancer coming back can be reduced further. Nerlynx’s approval was in line with expectations considering a favorable advisory panel vote earlier this year. Puma’s shares were up 8.5% on the news. Year-to-date (YTD), Puma’s shares are up a whopping 204.4%.Sarepta-BioMarin Settle Patent Dispute: Sarepta (SRPT  -  Free Report) and BioMarin settled their patent dispute regarding the use of Sarepta’s Exondys 51 and all future exon-skipping products for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). The companies signed a licensing agreement providing Sarepta with global exclusive rights to BioMarin’s DMD patent estate for Exondys 51 and all future exon-skipping products. BioMarin has the option to convert the license to a co-exclusive right if it decides to proceed with an exon-skipping therapy for DMD. Terms of the deal include a one-time $35 million payment from Sarepta as well as certain milestone-based payments and royalties. Sarepta’s shares were down 3%.PerformanceMedical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % Return Medical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % ReturnThe NASDAQ Biotechnology Index was up 1.1% over the last five trading sessions.

779,VRTX,"The biotech industry has witnessed a great turnaround this year after the drug pricing issue crippled its performance last year. After declining 27.1% last year, the Medical-Biotech /Genetics industry has risen 15.3% this year so far, outpacing 12.7% gain for the S&P 500 in the same time frame.The NASDAQ Biotechnology Index is up almost 26% year to date after sliding 19.1% in 2016. The Zacks Industry Rank is #106 (to 40% of the 250 plus Zacks industries) for Medical-Biomed and Genetics, indicating a bright outlook for the sector going forward.The biotech sector has a number of things going in its favor. Strong quarterly results, new product sales ramp up with rising demand, successful innovation and product line expansion, strong clinical study results, more frequent FDA approvals and continued strong performance from legacy products have played a pivotal role in bringing the sector on track this year. Another factor that has contributed to the sector’s surge is that President Trump's expected action on drug prices may not be as onerous as previously feared.These factors should continue to drive the sector through the rest of this year and probably the next as well despite challenges like rising competition, pipeline setbacks, slowdown in growth of mature products and generic competition for certain key drugs. On the broader macro front, the proposed tax reforms, if approved, will leave more cash in the hands of these companies. The cash can be invested for mergers/acquisitions, which have been relatively fewer this year compared with the last.With biotech stocks on a tear, here we have picked three of the biggest biotech companies which look well poised for growth and can be added to one’s portfolioAmgen, Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report)Amgen is one of the leading biotechnology companies in the world with several blockbuster drugs in its portfolio. Amgen’s newer drugs – Prolia, Xgeva, Vectibix, Nplate and Sensipar – are all performing well. Amgen is also progressing with its pipeline, including biosimilar drugs. Last month, it received FDA approval for Mvasi, its biosimilar version of Roche’s cancer drug, Avastin. Mvasi is the first biosimilar approved in the United States for the treatment of cancer. Other recent positive pipeline/regulatory developments at Amgen include EU approval for a pediatric formulation of Mimpara, positive long-term data from Kyprolis ENDEAVOR study, and regulatory filings for label expansion of Prolia and Kyprolis, among others.Supported by the positive developments, Amgen’s shares have outperformed the industry so far this year. Shares have risen 28%, comparing favorably with the industry’s gain. Amgen carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Earnings estimates for 2017 have risen 1.2% while that for 2018 have gone up by 1.3% in the past 90 days.Celgene Corporation (CELG  -  Free Report)Celgene’s key growth driver, multiple myeloma drug Revlimid, continues to drive revenues at the company. Meanwhile, Celgene’s label expansion efforts for Revlimid bode well for further sales growth of the drug. Other key products – Pomalyst/Imnovid, Abraxane and Otezla – are also performing well. A recent positive development at Celgene was the FDA approval for Idhifa for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML)Celgene also carries a Zacks Rank of 2. Earnings estimates for both 2017 and 2018 have risen by 0.7% in the past 90 days. The stock has gone up by 26.1% this year, outperforming the industry.Biogen, Inc. (BIIB  -  Free Report)Biogen has a strong position in the multiple sclerosis market backed by a wide range of products. Biogen is trying to diversify its pipelineand is looking to strengthen its Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and other neurodegenerative disorders pipeline. Newly launched Spinraza for spinal muscular atrophy is also off to a promising start. Spinraza has witnessed faster-than-expected adoption in the United States and Biogen is ramping up launch efforts  internationally.Recent key positive pipeline/regulatory developments at Biogen include promising long-term dataon Alzheimer disease candidate, aducanumab and EU approval of Imraldi, Biogen’s biosimilar version of AbbVie’s top-selling blockbuster drug, Humira. Biogen has made several new executive appointments to bring its management team back on track after several key executives departed over the past couple of years including CEO George A. Scangos and CFO Paul Clancy.Biogen, also a #2 Ranked stock, has seen its 2017 earnings estimates rise 4.7% for 2017 and 2.3% for 2017 over the past 90 days. Shares have risen 11.5% this year.Two other biotech companies, though smaller than the above mentioned companies, are worth mentioning.Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (VRTX  -  Free Report) has seen its share price shoot up 106.6% this year so far with earnings estimates rising 5% for 2017 and 6.8% for 2018. The stock is riding high on the success of its cystic fibrosis (CF) pipeline, particularly its triple combination CF regimens as these have the potential to treat up to 90% of CF patients.Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (REGN  -  Free Report) saw the launch of its key pipeline candidates Dupixent for atopic dermatitis and Kevzara for rheumatoid arthritis in the United States this year. Both the drugs are also approved in the EU. Meanwhile, Regeneron’s key growth driver, Eylea, continues to drive revenues on market share gains and the company is expanding the drug's label for additional indications. While Regeneron’s shares have risen 25.9% this year, its earnings estimates have gone up by 16.6% for 2017 and 7.3% for 2018.Both Vertex and Regeneron have been sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for quite some time and may soon join the league of the big biotech stocks.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?

781,VRTX,"Swiss pharmaceutical company Novartis AG (NVS  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 18.A look at Novartis’ share price movement year to date shows that the stock has outperformed the Zacks classified Large Cap Pharma industry. Its shares have rallied 13.3% compared with the industry’s gain of 11.3%.In the last reported quarter, Novartis delivered a positive earnings surprise of 2.7%. The company has posted an average positive earnings surprise of 3.28% in the trailing four quarters. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to Impact the QuarterNovartis operates under three segments: Innovative Medicines (Pharmaceuticals), Alcon and Sandoz (Generics).New products like Cosentyx and Entresto should boost the top line. Cosentyx has been strong and the company has grabbed market shares from rivals like AbbVie’s (ABBV  -  Free Report) Humira and Amgen’s (AMGN  -  Free Report) Enbrel. Cosentyx achieved the blockbuster status in 2016 and recorded over $1 billion of sales.Novartis has broadened its oncology portfolio through acquisitions. FDA’s recent approval of Kisqali, for use in combination with an aromatase inhibitor for the first-line treatment of postmenopausal women with hormone receptor positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 negative (HR+/HER2-) advanced or metastatic breast cancer will further boost the company's oncology portfolio.  Meanwhile, the FDA has also recently approved a label expansion of Zykadia as the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer.Additionally, Novartis’ generic arm, Sandoz, is making efforts to strengthen its biosimilars portfolio. The company plans to launch four biosimilars of major oncology and immunology biologics across key geographies by 2020. The company is, however, facing significant pricing pressures in the U.S. due to a delay in the launch of Glatopa 40mg. This is expected to impact the second-quarter results.Also, exclusivity of some of the key drugs in Novartis’ portfolio is hurting the company’s top line.  The company’s blockbuster drug, Diovan, is facing stiff generic competition in the U.S., the EU and Japan. Gleevec lost exclusivity in the U.S. in Feb 2016 and in the EU in Dec 2016, thereby leading to generic competition. Exforge is also facing generic competition in the U.S. and the EU. Furthermore, the oncology drugs are facing new competition in the form of immuno-oncology therapies.The negative impact of generic competition is expected to impact sales by $2.5 billion in 2017.The company’s ophthalmologic division, Alcon, continues to face challenges due to lower surgical equipments sales. Stiff competition faced by intraocular lens and a slowdown in demand for equipment purchases continue to act as dampeners. We do not expect any improving trends in the division’s sales in the to-be-reported quarter.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Novartis will beat on earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat estimates.

Although the rank is favorable, the company’s 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Novartis AG Price and EPS Surprise  Novartis AG Price and EPS Surprise | Novartis AG QuoteStock to ConsiderHere is one stock in the healthcare sector that you may want to consider, as our model shows that it has the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (VRTX  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +16.7% and a Zacks Rank #1.
