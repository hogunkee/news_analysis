22,OXY,"It seems that everything is going the energy sector's way.The price of oil is trending higher, and the sector is expected to blow the doors off second-quarter earnings. Energy companies on the whole are expected to expand earnings 139.8% in Q2 as the sector continues to emerge from a two-year earnings recession, according to research firm CFRA.Indeed, many companies' earnings are still coming up against easy year-ago comparisons. For example, the consensus estimate for Occidental Petroleum's (OXY) EPS of 693% growth compares against a profit of just 15 cents a share in Q2 of 2017.Crude is the tide that lifts all oil stocks, and the price of U.S. oil briefly topped $75 a barrel the past week. It was the highest level since November 2014. Major oil-producing countries are keeping supplies from swelling, and supply constraints pop up in Iran, Libya and Venezuela. Meanwhile, producers continue driving down costs.Among IBD's industry groups, only U.S. exploration and production is in the top 20 of 197 groups. Drilling is No. 57.Energy's expected profit growth is far above any other sector. The second-best sector is materials, with a projected growth of 29.6% thanks to higher commodity prices and higher volumes, says Lindsey Bell, CFRA investment strategist.Financials and information technology are forecast to grow profits 22.7% and 21.3%, respectively. The other seven S&P sectors are estimated to lag the S&P 500's overall profit increase.Technology remains the market's big profit engine. It's headed for the seventh quarter in a row in the top three sectors and the eighth quarter with double-digit growth, Bell notes. Telecommunications is seen rising 15.2%, industrials 14.1%, consumer discretionary 13.4%, health care 9.9% and consumer staples 7.4%. Real estate and utilities are the only sector indicated to decrease Q2 earnings, down 3.8% and 1.5%.For the entire S&P 500, CFRA sees another strong quarter of 19.5% growth. Historically, quarterly growth ends up 3.5 to 4.5 percentage points higher than initial estimates. That might put final earnings up 23%, on par with the 23.3% increase recorded in the first quarter.""We expect this will be the second quarter in a row for earnings growth of greater than 20%, something that hasn't been recorded since 2010 (a result of a rebound in earnings off recessionary declines),"" Bell wrote in a June 28 report. ""This time the robust growth rate is a reflection of strong sales growth and reduced tax rates from the new tax policy.""Revenue for the S&P 500 is expected to increase 8.9%. Materials is forecast to grow sales 30.3%, energy 19.7%, health care 14.7% and technology 11.4%. Consumer staples and utilities are the only sectors expected to report a decline in sales.Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.RELATED:Permian Oil Prices Dive As Gas Prices Rise, Boosting These RefinersTop Shale Oil Names See Profits Soar As Crude Passes $70

28,OXY,"When Occidental Petroleum (OXY) packed up its Los Angeles, Calif., headquarters and shipped out to Houston in 2014, few investors had heard of the Permian Basin. At the time, Occidental was the largest oil producer in Texas. It was the largest producer of natural gas in California.By 2017, the almost century-old company was the third-largest oil play in Texas. That put it just behind EOG Resources (EOG) and Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD). It is also among the largest holders of acreage and producers of oil in the Permian Basin. That is the west Texas redoubt that Bloomberg has said is on track to ""become the world's largest oil patch over the next decade.""Occidental shares slipped 2.4% in weak trade Monday, edging just below the stock's 50-day moving average. The move technically put the stock back into a buy range above a 78.18 buy point in a cup base. Investors probably don't want to enter a stock that high in the buy range. But a rebound off the 50-day line could produce a follow-on buying opportunity.Many Permian producers face a musical chairs-type shake out, as production outpaces the available capacity of pipelines to transport the oil to market. But Occidental owns its own gathering systems within the basin, the pipelines that take oil and gas from the wellhead to larger pipelines or to separation facilities.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseAlso, Occidental has locked down contracts giving them capacity of 470,000 barrels per day out of the Permian, according to a CNBC interview with chief executive Vicki Hollub in May. At that time, that was roughly double the company's output within the basin, she said.In mid-June, capacity bottlenecks trimmed prices for oil coming out of the Permian to about $10 below West Texas Intermediate crude priced at Cushing, Okla., the transaction location for the WTI benchmark. The International Energy Agency believes take-away capacity from the Permian fields will ""become insufficient by midyear, with a deficit possibly reaching as much as 290,000 barrels a day during the first half of 2019.""In addition, Occidental is expanding the loading capacity of its Ingleside oil export terminal in Corpus Christi, Texas. It is adding loading arms and dredging the terminal to a depth of 66 feet, allowing it to load VLCC tankers — the largest class of oil tanker afloat — with oil headed for markets in Europe and Asia. Crude exports out of Corpus Christi are expected to reach 1 million barrels per day by 2020.In 2013, just before its move to Texas, Occidental began exiting locations in the Bakken shale of Montana and North Dakota. It spun off its operations in California, and divested four international operations. As a result, production decreased 40% — just as the global oil glut was swinging into gear. Earnings per share dropped by 98%, to 12 cents, in 2015, followed by a $1-per-share loss the following year.Earnings recovered to 89 cents per share last year. They are projected to rebound to $4.61 for 2018, with a 673% jump projected by the consensus estimate for the second quarter.Occidental operates in three segments: oil and gas, chemicals and midstream and marketing. In 2017, the oil and gas unit produced about 63% of revenue. Chemicals were another 35%. The oil unit generated 55% of total earnings. Chemicals were 41%.The strength of diversification was apparent in the segment numbers. For 2017, Occidental's operations outside the U.S. accounted for more than 100% of profit, because domestic operations and oil exploration efforts both lost money.An increasing number of analysts are questioning how much longer the Permian basin can continue to increase its total output, and at what point the Permian's localized glut might began to spread.Hollub said she expects additional pipeline capacity will be built, easing the take-away restrictions. More crucial, she told CNBC, are labor shortages plaguing the industry.She said companies attempting to ramp activity much above current levels are in for a struggle, and face rising costs.""We're really at the activity level we want to be,"" she said, pointing to Occidental's current output from the field. ""If you are a company that is not trying to ramp up significantly, you have a significant advantage.""Occidental has delivered uninterrupted quarterly dividends since 1975, with annual increases each year since 2002. The current annual rate is $3.08 per share, which yields about 3.7% on an annualized basis.RELATED: Dow Giant Triggers Sell Signal As China Trade War Boosts RivalIBD Stock Of The Day: This China Internet Gives Back All Its GainsPermian Oil Prices Dive As Gas Prices Rise, Boosting These RefinersTop Shale Oil Names See Profits Soar As Crude Passes $70Divergence In The Stock Market Is A Worrisome Sign

36,OXY,"Diamondback Energy (FANG) and Occidental Petroleum (OXY) reported fourth-quarter results above Wall Street estimates Tuesday as the International Energy Agency predicted that U.S. production will rise faster this year than global demand growth.X Diamondback reported adjusted earnings of $1.56 per share with revenue of $399.2 million. Analysts expected EPS of $1.52 with revenue of $371 million.The U.S. shale producer sees full-year production of 108,000 to 116,000 barrels per day, up 40% from 2017's output midpoint. It issued full-year capital-spending guidance of $1.3 million to $1.5 million.Diamondback shares rose 5.4% in late trade on the stock market today. Diamondback led several breakouts from the oil patch in late December, but with oil prices pulling back and the stock market falling into a correction, Diamondback and other oil stocks have been big losers this month.Occidental's core diluted EPS was 41 cents vs. a loss of 13 cents in the year-ago quarter. Revenue was $3.59 billion. Analysts expected EPS of 39 cents on revenue of $3.5 billion.The company set its 2018 capital-spending budget at $3.9 billion and sees 8%-12% production growth for the year.Shares were not yet active after hours.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.In its monthly report Tuesday, the IEA raised its global oil-demand growth outlook to 1.4 million barrels per day, up from 1.3 million bpd in the month-ago report. Oil demand grew at a rate of 1.6 million bpd last year.But U.S. crude output will likely outpace demand growth as the IEA expects U.S. production to overtake Saudi Arabia ""soon"" and ""catch up to Russia by the end of the year.""""Today, having cut costs dramatically, U.S. producers are enjoying a second wave of growth so extraordinary that in 2018 their increase in liquids production could equal global demand growth,"" the Paris-based energy watchdog said in the report.Earlier the U.S. Energy Information Administration said domestic production could hit 11 million bpd by the end of 2018.The IEA report was similar to OPEC's monthly report out Monday. The cartel said it sees global demand growth increasing by 60,000 barrels per day to 1.59 million, putting total global consumption this year at 98.6 million bpd.But the demand increase comes as it raised U.S. production growth by 150,000 bpd.The IEA said demand for OPEC oil this year will average 32.3 million bpd. Compliance with the production-cut deal to remove 1.8 million bpd from the market hit 137% last month on a drop in production from Venezuela, as an economic crisis hit production.U.S. crude fell 10 cents to $59.19 per barrel.Exxon Mobil (XOM) dipped 0.2%.

Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) said last week that 100 rigs could be added to the highly productive Permian.Earlier this month, EOG Resources (EOG) announced it would purchase privately held Yates Petroleum to expand its presence in the Permian. And in July, Diamondback Energy bought $560 million worth of assets in the southern portion of the Permian. The Permian is in West Texas and SE New Mexico.U.S. oil rigs rose by seven to 425 this week, Baker Hughes reported Friday, the highest in seven months. Rigs in the Permian Basin rose by three to 204, nearly half.IBD'S TAKE: Soaring oil prices triggered a slew of shale players breaking out of consolidations and rebounding from 10-week lines, including Diamondback.Oil prices shot up 8.5% for the week after OPEC agreed to cut production, essentially ending its two-year effort to drive out U.S. shale players.

41,OXY,"Apache (APA) shares jumped early Wednesday on a report that Occidental Petroleum (OXY) offered to buy the firm, but Occidental said it has no knowledge of a bid.A report from Oil and Gas People said Oxy would announce a deal worth at least $25 billion for Apache. But Oxy told Reuters ""We don't have any knowledge around this topic.""Apache shares closed up 2.7% in the stock market today. Occidental shares lost 2%.In November, Anadarko Petroleum (APC) withdrew its offer to buy Apache, which rejected the deal without discussing the matter with Anadarko.Meanwhile, oil prices have been rallying in recent weeks on signs the global supply glut may be easing as well as on production disruptions in Canada and Nigeria.But crude futures pared gains Wednesday after the Energy Information Administration reported a surprise domestic inventory increase of 1.3 million barrels vs. forecasts for a decline of 3 million barrels and the American Petroleum Institute's report late Tuesday for a drawdown of 1.14 million barrels.Brent crude fell 0.7% to end at $48.93 a barrel. U.S. crude dipped 0.3% to settle at $48.19 a barrel. 
"
42,OXY,"Despite a decline in U.S. output, oil stockpiles keep rising -- thanks to unabated production overseas -- but a ""serious"" supply drop will be seen soon, potentially helping shares of Exxon Mobil (XOM), Chevron (CVX), BP (BP) and Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA).The continued buildup in inventory has weighed on crude prices, creating stumbling blocks to a recent rally. On Friday, U.S. crude futures rose 0.9% to $47.75 a barrel, but are still near 2016 highs and gained 3% for the week.Exxon shares closed down 0.4% in the stock market today. Chevron fell less than 0.1%, BP dipped 0.15%, and Royal Dutch Shell ended virtually flat. Baker Hughes (BHI) said U.S. oil rigs in operation were unchanged this week at 318, the first time in nine weeks that it hasn't fallen.Since hitting a high of 9.61 million barrels a day in June 2015, U.S. production has fallen 8.5%. But in that time, inventory excluding the Strategic Petroleum Reserve has climbed 15%. Since June 2014, the stockpile has jumped 40%, raising fears that U.S. storage capacity will hit its limit and send any new supply to flood the spot market.On Wednesday, the Energy Information Administration reported a surprise inventory increase of 1.3 million barrels vs. forecasts for a decline of 3 million barrels. But production fell to 8.79 million barrels per day from 8.8 million barrels a week earlier.Helped by lower costs and efficiency improvements, U.S. output has been surprisingly resilient, with producers like Occidental Petroleum (OXY), Apache (APA) and Continental Resources (CLR) also recently raising their 2016 output forecasts.Factors outside the U.S. are also at play. Canadian oil that was in the pipelines before wildfires hit in the oil sands region of the Alberta province are just now making it to the U.S. Further, imports from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries remain strong, according to Phil Flynn, senior market analyst at the Price Futures Group.""I think OPEC has been sending every barrel they can, but I think that now it will start to fall as output in OPEC nations slow, Iraq output has peaked, and Venezuela is a shambles,"" Flynn wrote in an email.""Nigeria also is falling, and even Saudi Arabia production is falling. The wildfires' impact will be felt in the weeks to come because we are still seeing (that) old production just hit our storage. That will soon fall to a trickle.""Flynn expects to see ""serious oil supply drops in the coming weeks.""Militants have blocked workers from getting to Exxon Mobil's terminal in Nigeria. On Thursday, an official from Lukoil told Bloomberg that Iraq's production has likely peaked and will fall under targets over the next two years.

43,OXY,"More than $1 billion a day. That's the price tag for a Permian Basin pipeline crunch that's increasingly affecting investors as much as it is West Texas oil drillers.Eight of the top explorers focused on the booming U.S. shale region have lost $15.6 billion in combined market value in about two weeks, as shipping constraints devour the profit they can fetch for a barrel of crude. Parsley Energy (PE) shares have wilted 16% in that time; Diamondback Energy (FANG) has been defanged, down 18%.Even as production soars, dwindling pipeline space and a rail and trucking shortage have raised shipping costs, boosting the discount Permian producers take to offload their oil. The bottleneck benefits refiners who can buy cheaper crude and pipeline owners with extra space, but it's dragging down explorers.""You just don't want to touch these Permian names,"" said Gabriele Sorbara, a Williams Capital Group analyst in New York. ""They are falling off a cliff.""Relief may not come until 2020, when new pipelines are expected to be up and running. For now, here's a rundown of winners and losers amid the space crunch:Being a ""pure play"" shale producer, even a Permian stalwart, is no longer the ticket to success for energy equities.Since May 21, the price of benchmark West Texas intermediate crude has fallen about 10% and companies focused primarily on the Permian have been shunned. The hardest fall: Concho Resources (CXO), which has lost $4.1 billion off its market capitalization as of Tuesday.As of Wednesday, oil in Midland, Texas, was trading for about $19 a barrel below Brent crude, the global benchmark price.Even Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD), with relatively strong finances and secure pipeline contracts, has been swept up, Williams Capital's Sorbara said by phone. It's lost $3.2 billion in market value, or 9%, since May 21.While the shortages are real, he deems much of the market sell-off ""overblown,"" since even discounted Permian crude is selling for well above where many producers set their budgets earlier this year.Investors, though, are fleeing to the relative safety of larger names with more diverse portfolios such as Occidental Petroleum (OXY), whose shares are flat over the past couple weeks. The Permian's biggest oil producer also pumps in the Middle East and Colombia, with roughly 40% of its output this year based on higher international crude pricing, Capital One Securities said in an analyst note.The company also operates pipelines and a Gulf Coast export terminal that will benefit from cheaper U.S. crude prices. ""The largest companies or companies with diverse portfolios can rotate capital around,"" Sorbara said. ""If you're a pure play, the only thing you can do is step on the brakes.""With bottlenecks between the Permian and major Gulf Coast refiners, operators in other parts of the country served by less-congested pipelines have a relative advantage, analysts say.That includes Delek US (DK), CVR Refining (CVRR) and HollyFrontier (HFC), with refineries in New Mexico, Arkansas and northeastern Texas, among other locations, according to Barclays. Delek gets about 78% of its crude from the Permian, HollyFrontier gets 39% and CVR gets 14%, the bank said in a June 5 analyst report.Delek shares have climbed 7.5% in the past two weeks while CVR is up 3.3% and HollyFrontier is up 1%.""Simply put, we think U.S. refiners win big with lower input costs,"" analysts including Justin Jenkins at Raymond James & Associates said in a June 4 note.Enterprise Products Partners and Magellan Midstream Partners also stand to benefit from the blowout in Midland prices as they own crucial pipelines in the Permian and dock space on the Gulf used for exports — and have plans to add more.""The very idea of congestion is beneficial,"" said Sandy Fielden, director of oil research at Chicago-based Morningstar. ""If I'm going to pitch my new pipeline or expand my pipeline, and I'm going to hold my open season, I can expect to see a full crowd there anxious to sign up quickly.""Enterprise started full service in April on its 416-mile Midland-to-Sealy pipeline, which can carry some 575,000 barrels per day of crude from the heart of the Permian to key export facilities in Houston. They also own the lion's share of crude storage tanks and docks along the Gulf.Magellan operates and owns part of the 400,000-barrel-a-day BridgeTex pipeline, transporting oil from the Permian to Corpus Christi, Texas. That route is scheduled for expansion in early 2019 because of added interest. The company said last month that almost all existing customers on its Longhorn pipeline, connecting the Permian to Houston, have renewed their contracts for two years.

60,OXY,"The Federal Reserve convinced markets that a June rate hike is on the table. Warren Buffett disclosed a big Apple (AAPL) stake.

General Motors (GM) and Uber tested self-driving cars on the road, joining Alphabet (GOOGL) Google cars, while Google held a major developers conference.The major averages continued to move sideways in a choppy fashion as the market remains under pressure. The Nasdaq rose 1.1% for the week after falling for the prior four weeks. The S&P 500 eked out a 0.3% rise while the Dow Jones industrial average lost 0.2%, its fourth straight weekly decline. The S&P 500 and Dow moved back above their 50-day moving averages on Monday as Apple rose on Buffett's stake, but then fell back as near-term Fed rate hike buzz took hold, pushing up the dollar. Thanks to Friday gains, the S&P 500, Dow and Nasdaq are slightly higher for the week.While some stocks broke out -- Salesforce and Lowe's -- older breakouts struggled. Facebook (FB) closed just below a buy point Thursday, though it regained its entry point on Friday. McDonald's (MCD) fell below its late March entry area.Minutes from the Federal Reserve’s April meeting showed policymakers are close to raising benchmark interest rates again next month, surprising Fed watchers who priced in an increase later in the year.

Profit and sales guidance was also bullish. Analysts had lowered expectations ahead of Cisco earnings due to the growing number of companies outsourcing to cloud computing service providers such as Amazon Web Services, reducing demand for Cisco’s networking gear. The lowered expectations also reflected lower spending on information technology overall.Well aware of the trends, Cisco is diversifying into newer, higher-growth segments such as software, data centers, security, wireless and the Internet of Things market.Cisco stock rose 5.4% for the week.The Energy Information Administration reported a domestic stockpile increase of 1.3 million barrels vs. a 3 million barrel decline expected by analysts.

But sales dropped 5% to $16.2 billion, missing estimates. Same-store sales grew 1.2%, short of predictions for a 1.6% gain. Target’s Q2 EPS guidance of $1 to $1.20 widely missed expectations for $1.36.Shares plunged 7.1%, hitting their lowest levels since late 2014.Wal-Mart’s Q1 profit fell 5 cents to 98 cents a share but beat estimates by 10 cents. Sales rose 0.9% to $115.9 billion vs. forecasts for a drop to $113.2 billion. U.S. same-store sales climbed 1%, the seventh straight gain.

Sonic (SONC) said it would miss its own fiscal Q3 same-store sales target, triggering an 8.65% weekly stock loss. The reports, which followed a weak May 11 sales outlook from Wendy’s (WEN), intensified fears about burger competition as both value and upscale offerings spread. Wendy’s stock fell 2.8%. Shake Shack (SHAK), which popped on solid results earlier this month, slid 6.9%. McDonald’s lost 4.9%.Campbell Soup (CPB) and Hormel (HRL) reported disappointing quarterly results, perhaps indicating that sluggish consumer spending is spilling over into the foods group. Hormel, the parent of Spam lunch meat, Skippy peanut butter and other leading brands, plunged xx% for the week to a 2016 low. Q2 earnings growth was strong as sales in 4 of 5 product groups rose, Hormel also raised guidance.

But sales fell 1.6% to $1.87 bil, missing Wall Street’s target. Shares fell 6.4% Friday and 9.4% for the week, falling to a 3-month low.

61,OXY,"Top shale oil producers like Continental Resources (CLR) and EOG Resources (EOG) are on tap to report quarterly results this week and could give an update on when drilling might start again after crude prices jumped 20% last month.U.S. oil prices are nearing the break-even level of $45 to $55 per barrel, when some producers could start bringing wells online.Some producers may have even started pumping when oil hit $40 per barrel. Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) and Sanchez Energy (SN), which are active in Texas, already reported results in April. Pioneer boosted its 2016 production growth outlook to 12% from an earlier outlook of 10%, helped in part by increased output from the Spraberry/Wolfcamp zones.Sanchez reported a 25% rise in first-quarter production to 56,500 barrels of oil per day, above its 48,000-52,000 guidance, on better-than-expected results in the Eagle Ford’s western Catarina region.

But in the Delaware Basin of west Texas, Anadarko grew sales volumes by 47%. In the DJ Basin of northeast Colorado, sales rose 11%.Despite the recent sharp rally in oil prices, some shale companies may wait and see how sustainable the upswing really is. EOG Resources  Chairman Bill Thomas said at an industry conference in March that his company won’t rush to boost output right after oil hits $60 a barrel.Producers also have to wait for capital markets to reopen and for workers and rigs to come back. Jason Bordoff, founding director of Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy, has said it could take nine months to a year before production ramps up again.Market headwinds also remain. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries pumped out 32.64 million barrels per day in April, near a new high, according to a Reuters survey.

65,OXY,"Anadarko Petroleum (APC) slashed its dividend by 81% on Tuesday as the company looks to boost its cash holdings, after ConocoPhillips (COP) cut its dividend by 66% last week.Anadarko, an oil exploration and production company, lowered its dividend to 5 cents per share from 27 cents per share.""We believe this adjustment to our dividend is the appropriate action to take in the current environment,"" said CEO Al Walker in a release.  ""On an annualized basis, this action provides approximately $450 million of additional cash available to enhance our operations and financial flexibility. Our Board will continue to evaluate the appropriate dividend on a quarterly basis.""Anadarko shares closed down 7% to 37.24 in the stock market today.Last week, Anadarko warned it might cut its dividend because its falling share price raised the yield too high.Also last week, ConocoPhillips cut its dividend to 25 cents from 74 cents -- its first dividend reduction since 1991. The move came just two months after the company said the “dividend remains the highest priority use of our cash.”Shares fell 2.5% to 33.58.Other dividends from oil and gas companies could be under pressure. Exxon Mobil (XOM)  has had to borrow money to fund dividend payments, and analysts speculate that BP (BP) could have trouble maintaining its payout if oil stays below $50 a barrel.Exxon shares dipped 1.3%.

69,OXY,"Diamondback Energy (FANG) said Wednesday it has never pushed to expand oil production just for the sake of growth, but the shale firm still has big production and capital spending increases planned for this year.X During the company's conference call Wednesday, CEO Travis Stice said that Diamondback wants to maintain flexibility and accelerate activity as commodity prices and service costs allow.""Diamondback has never been a 'drill baby drill' company,"" Stice continued.Still, the company said late Tuesday that it sees full-year production of 108,000-116,000 barrels per day, up 37.6%-46% from 2017's production of 79,200 bpd, which was an 84% jump from 2016.Diamondback isn't the only company looking to boost production. Occidental Petroleum (OXY) said Tuesday that it sees 2018 production rising 8%-12% from 2017 levels.Led by shale producers increasing their output this year, the U.S. is expected to become the world's largest producer. The International Energy Agency said Tuesday that U.S. production will overtake Saudi Arabia ""soon"" and ""catch up to Russia by the end of the year.""On Wednesday, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said domestic oil production edged up to 10.27 million barrels per day from 10.25 million the prior week.Shares of Diamondback Energy jumped 6.8% to 122.83 on the stock market today as U.S. crude futures rebounded back above $60 a barrel. Occidental rose 0.21%.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.Diamondback issued full-year capital-spending guidance of $1.3 million-$1.5 million, up from $925.1 million in 2017, representing an increase of 40%-62%.The budget increase comes as executives eye higher service costs.Diamondback expects oil production costs to increase 12% in the Midland Basin this year and 17% in the Delaware, but those figures could rise if oil prices continue to rise as oil service providers will likely raise prices.The shale industry, Diamondback especially, has been quiet on the M&A front recently.""The fact you haven't seen any trades occur, really talks to lack of true quality acreage that's out there to be added,"" Stice said.Diamondback's note of restraint echoes Q3 reports from shale companies in October, when they boosted spending guidance but emphasized capital discipline and their ability to operate within cash flow.But last month, Schlumberger (SLB) said it expects oil companies to start spending more.

70,OXY,"The number of oil rigs operating in the U.S. fell for the 14th time in 15 weeks, as top shale firms hold off on completing wells.Baker Hughes (BHI) said Friday that the rig count fell by 13 to 400 in the past week, the lowest level since December 2009 and down from a peak of 1,609 in October 2014.The number of natural gas rigs ticked up to 102 from 101, despite prices hitting a 17-year low during the week.Crude prices rallied for most of Friday as pipeline issues in Iraq and Nigeria are expected to keep 800,000 barrels temporarily off the market. But they reversed lower, with Brent futures closing down 0.5% at $35.10 a barrel and U.S. oil down 0.9% at $32.78.The oil bust and the collapse in drilling activity have hit oilfield service providers especially hard, with the pain continuing as prices stay lower for longer.On Thursday, Halliburton (HAL) said it would cut its workforce by another 8%, roughly 5,000 jobs. Since 2014, the company has slashed 22,000 employees, or 25% of its workforce. Halliburton also has been divesting assets to get European regulators to approve its acquisition of Baker Hughes.Rival Schlumberger (SLB) has laid off 34,000 workers, or 26% of its workforce, since the end of 2014, including 10,000 cuts in in the past quarter.Baker Hughes shares closed up 2.3% in the stock market today. Halliburton rose 0.95%. Schlumberger edged up 0.2%.The new round of  layoffs come as U.S. shale drillers stop completion activities in the massive Bakken shale formation.Late Wednesday, Continental Resources (CLR) said it stopped fracking operations in the Bakken. It already had planned to defer most completions in the North Dakota play in 2016.It has four operated drilling rigs in the North Dakota Bakken, with plans to maintain that level through the year, but said it has no stimulation crews deployed there.Also late Wednesday, Whiting Petroleum (WLL) said it will stop completing wells and cut its 2016 capital spending budget by 80% from 2015 to $500 million.Shale companies hope that by leaving wells drilled but not completed, they can bring back production quickly once oil prices rise. Fracking a well normally accounts for two-thirds of a well’s total production costs.While oil companies are trying to save money by operating fewer rigs and slashing budgets, their debt ratings are in jeopardy as lower revenue and investment will likely hurt companies for the next four years.Late Thursday, Moody's put Chevron (CVX) on review for a downgrade on expected negative free cash flow and changed Exxon Mobil’s (XOM) debt rating outlook to negative, as lower capital reinvestment will likely haunt the oil major for the rest of the decade.The ratings agency also downgraded ConocoPhillips’ (COP), Marathon Oil’s (MRO), Devon Energy’s (DVN) and Apache’s (APA) senior unsecured ratings with a negative outlooks late Thursday.

84,OXY,"The economy expanded at an annual rate of just 1.5% in Q3, a few ticks lower than analysts had expected and a big comedown from the robust pace of growth notched in Q2.But much of the weakness was due to an inventory drawdown.

That took 1.4 percentage points from growth in Q3.In fact, underlying demand was relatively strong. Consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of the economy, rose 3.2%.

89,OXY,"Oil prices have started the new year at the highest levels since 2015, raising hopes for a sustained rally after more than three years of ups and downs that saw drastic role reversals among the industry's top players.X As investors sort out how much the industry will return to business as usual and how much a new normal will take root, here are five issues to watch:After prices crashed in 2014, oil giants took the unusual step of cutting dividends or halting buybacks to conserve cash. But they appear to have turned a corner last year after reining in investments and selling some assets. U.S. tax cuts will also free up more capital that could be returned to shareholders.In November, Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) announced it would pay its first full dividend since 2015 and said that it would buy back at least $25 billion. In October, BP (BP) said it would buy back shares for the first time in three years. Look to Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) to see what they will do on dividends and buybacks.Collectively, oil companies aren't expected to dump cash into oil fields even if prices rebound. Energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie said investment in exploration will fall 7% this year to $37 billion vs. 2016 and will be down 60% from a peak in 2014. Spending by oil majors is expected to fall 4% but drilling is expected to rise slightly.Shale producers could make or break oil's rally after their emergence as market disrupters prompted OPEC in 2014 to step back from its swing producer role by allowing prices to sink.This past fall, U.S. exploration and production companies signaled that they are shifting their focus to cash-flow discipline rather than increasing spending to chase rising oil prices.""Investment community wants to start seeing a bit more upside. They are interested in profits rather than production. I would expect that to continue,"" said Jim Krane, an energy analyst at Rice University's Baker Institute for Public Policy.But Tom O'Donnell, a senior energy analyst at the consulting firm Wikistrat, doesn't think shale will remain disciplined for long, despite assurances from Continental Resources (CLR) CEO Harold Hamm.""When it looks like OPEC is getting control of the market that's when the other guys come back and the spotlight will be on them,"" O'Donnell said.Either way, output will keep rising, testing OPEC's plans to curb its own production to prop up crude. The Energy Information Administration expects U.S. production to hit 10 million barrels per day by the second-half of the year as companies like EOG Resources (EOG), Occidental Petroleum (OXY) and Apache (APA) cut costs and improve well output.The world's top oil exporter is preparing for an IPO of its state-run oil giant and changed Saudi Aramco's status to a joint stock company at the start of the year to get it ready for a listing.The company's $2 trillion valuation would make it the world's largest publicly traded company and a 5% offering would make the IPO the biggest ever in proceeds generated. While exchanges in London and New York are jockeying to get a piece of the action, watch for a private placement of Aramco shares with China playing a major role.A private placement is easier than jumping through all the hoops the SEC would demand from a U.S. listing and it will also save the kingdom a lot of embarrassment if the company doesn't fetch it's lofty IPO price, said the Baker Institute's Krane.""It also links them up, creates a mutual dependence between Saudi Arabia and China, which is exactly what Aramco needs if it wants to stay in the game as oil demand starts to slip in the developed world,"" he added.Also be on the lookout for additional moves in U.S. shale. Saudi Arabia is reportedly looking at natural-gas assets in the Permian and Eagle Ford shale formations and is in talks with Tellurian (TELL), a U.S. liquefied natgas producer, as it looks to break into U.S. shale, according to the Wall Street Journal.Investing in shale would give Saudi Arabia access to the U.S. industry's ability to quickly start and stop production projects and use that knowledge back at home.""Saudi Arabia has a lot of shale, a lot of tight gas,"" Krane said. ""Aramco needs to get to the gas because Saudi Arabia is very short on natural gas. The only way to get to it without imports is to tap into shale.""The oil group will have a tricky balancing act this year as it tries to keep U.S. shale at bay, its own members in line and oil prices in a sweet spot.At OPEC's November meeting, Saudi Energy Minster Khalid Al-Falih said that ""the contribution of shale is going to be very much manageable"" next year.But the International Energy Agency has said 2018 ""might not be quite so happy for OPEC producers"" as U.S. output increases.Still, OPEC sees markets rebalancing late this year after agreeing in November to extend its production-cut deal to the end of 2018.OPEC's resolve will be tested if crude prices rise enough to trigger more shale growth and increasing calls from its own members to lift production cuts. In December, Kuwait's oil minister suggested that members will discuss an exit strategy at the biannual meeting in June.The Trump administration is making moves to roll back energy regulations. The Interior Department's Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement wants to remove regulations that were enacted after the 2010 Deepwater Horizon spill that killed 11 people and released 4.9 million barrels of oil in the Gulf of Mexico.And on Thursday, the Interior Department issued a draft proposal to open about 90% of the U.S. outer continental shelf to offshore drilling leases between 2019 and 2024, in what would be the largest lease sale ever.Whether companies would actually boost offshore drilling is another story, as such ventures are typically costlier and require higher crude prices to be attractive.Despite the Trump administration's moves, the ending of the U.S. oil-export ban while Barack Obama was president will likely remain a bigger factor for U.S. energy producers.""The biggest energy steps were taken by Obama, the natural gas and oil exports, those were the big steps and now the opening of drilling and cutting some regulations on emissions is probably going to be small potatoes to legalizing exports,"" Krane said.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Energy Stocks And Industry News: Oil, Gas, Solar, Coal

91,OXY,"Schlumberger (SLB), the world's largest oilfield services company, beat fourth-quarter forecasts Friday and expects oil companies to start spending more, while a top oil watchdog predicted U.S. oil output could surge past Saudi Arabia and Russia this year.X The bullish signals in spending and production follow the Q3 reporting season three months ago, when shale producers emphasized spending discipline over production growth.But since then, oil prices hit three-year highs as shale producers have been cutting expenses, with many of them suddenly flush with cash after tax cuts.Citing third-party surveys, Schlumberger expects a 15%-20% increase in North American investments in 2018 and a 5% increase in international spending, the first growth in four years.Those years saw lower spending due to the slump in crude. That, plus output curbs from OPEC and its allies, has translated to a tighter market, easing the supply glut that had weighed on prices.""This means the oil market is now in balance and the previous oversupply discount is gradually being replaced by a market tightness premium, which makes us increasingly positive on the global outlook for our business,"" Schlumberger CEO Paal Kibsgaard said in a statement.International markets are especially important to Schlumberger where management said it has four to five times the earnings power than in North American land operations.Shares closed up 0.1% at 76.43 on the stock market today after falling as much as 3% as U.S. crude prices dropped 0.9% to $63.37 a barrel.  Edward Jones analyst Brian Youngberg said while Schlumberger's outlook comments were generally positive, markets may have been disappointed by lack of a dividend increase.Halliburton (HAL), which is scheduled to report Q4 results Monday and is more exposed to North America, rose 1.3% and Baker Hughes (BHGE), on tap for Wednesday, closed flat. Oil and gas equipment company National Oilwell Varco (NOV) rallied to close up 0.2%. National Oilwell said 2017 results should come in at or above prior expectations.IBD'S TAKE: Buying or holding a stock can be risky heading into an earnings report. Here's an earnings options strategy that can help you cash in on post-earnings stock gains, while minimizing the risk from a weak quarter.Schlumberger's adjusted earnings jumped 78% to 48 cents per share while revenue climbed 15% to $8.179 billion. Revenue from North America rose 59% to $2.81 billion during the quarter. Analysts were expecting EPS of 44 cents on revenue of $8.12 billion, according to Zacks Investment Research.But Schlumberger took $2.7 billion in charges, with nearly $1 billion related to investments in Venezuela.The company also said it is exiting the marine and land seismic acquisition market, booked a $938 million charge on a Venezuelan investment, and signed a memorandum of understanding with Occidental Petroleum (OXY) for a five-year service project in New Mexico's Delaware basin for 700 wells.Also in a monthly report out Friday, the International Energy Agency raised its outlook for growth in U.S. oil production by 240,000 barrels a day to 1.35 million barrels, enough to top Saudi Arabia and Russia.""Relentless growth should see the U.S. hit historic highs above 10 million barrels a day (in production), overtaking Saudi Arabia and rivaling Russia during the course of 2018 — provided OPEC and non-OPEC restraints remain in place,"" the IEA said.In its own monthly report out Thursday, OPEC said U.S. shale producers lowered break-even costs between 2015 and 2017 but now service companies are raising rig and labor costs so break-even prices are rising.Despite increased costs, OPEC cited a JPMorgan report that found U.S. shale exploration and production companies could achieve ""decent rates of return"" at $60 per barrel even if costs rose by another 15%.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Energy Stocks And Industry News: Oil, Gas, Solar, CoalDividend Hikes, Largest IPO Ever Lead 5 Oil Stories To Watch This Year

98,OXY,"Saudi Arabia said it raised its crude output last month, a week after officials with the world's top oil exporter warned U.S. shale executives last week not to automatically assume a deal to trim production would be extended. The news sent U.S. crude futures lower for a seventh straight session.Saudi Arabia said it raised its oil production to 10.011 million barrels per day in February, up 2.7% from January, but still under the 10.05 million-barrel target the country agreed to under a production-cut deal reached last year between OPEC and top non-OPEC countries.But the number conflicted with figures OPEC derived from other sources, showing Saudi production falling by 68,100 barrels a day to 9.8 million barrels per day.After rallying before the OPEC data were released, U.S. crude closed down 1.4% to $47.72 a barrel, their lowest levels since late November. But prices rallied a bit in late trading after the American Petroleum Institute reported a decline of 531,000 barrels in U.S. oil inventories last week, while analysts expected a surge of 3.5 million barrels.Dow Jones industrial average component Exxon Mobil (XOM) shares dipped 0.5% to 80.99 on the stock market today. Fellow Dow stock Chevron (CVX) was off 1.8% to 107.36, hitting a four-month low and testing its 200-day line. BP (BP) retreated 1.9%, while Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) slid 2%.The OPEC report comes as Saudi energy minister Khalid Al-Falih told attendees at IHS's CERAWeek energy conference in Houston last week that the output deal is ""so far so good,"" but his country ""will not bear the burden of free rides"" by others in the agreement.Saudi officials also had a closed-door meeting with executives from top shale producers including ConocoPhillips (COP), EOG Resources (EOG) and Occidental Petroleum (OXY) warning that the producers should not assume the cartel will extend the output cuts, according to a Reuters report.Meanwhile, as U.S. shale rebounds, the additional supply will weigh further on crude prices. OPEC raised its growth forecast for U.S. oil production, now seeing an increase this year of 340,000 barrels per day, up by 100,000 barrels from a prior outlook.The bearish signs for oil come as OPEC members start pushing to extend their six-month production deal for another six months.While Saudi Arabia's Al-Falih said it was too early to decide on extend the output cuts, Iraq has signaled it wants an extension. And Kuwait's oil minister said Monday his country wants to extend the OPEC output cuts as U.S. stockpiles rose more than the cartel was expecting, according to the state run news agency Kuna.Iran said Tuesday it would stick to its end of the production deal, if the rest of OPEC does as well.""If OPEC members stay committed to the agreement (on freezing output), Iran will produce 3.8 million BPD of oil in (the) second half of the current year,"" Bijan Namdar Zanganeh was quoted as saying by state news agency IRNA, Reuters reported.RELATED: Why Oil Prices May Come Under Even More Pressure Next Month

129,OXY,"A bidding war for prime acreage in the Permian Basin is shaping up as Noble Energy (NBL), Marathon Oil (MRO), and Occidental Petroleum (OXY) are reportedly considering offers for Silver Hill Energy Partners.Silver Hill could be worth over $2 billion, according to a Bloomberg report, and Jefferies is reportedly working with Sliver Hill to find a buyer for the privately held company.Last year Noble bought Rosetta Resources for $3.9 billion to gain access to the Permian's Delaware basin.Noble Energy shares fell 0.35% on the stock market today, consolidating in a first stage flat base. Marathon shares retreated 0.1%. Occidental shares were off 1.7%.U.S. crude tumbled 2% to $43.03 per barrel, losing 6.2% for the week. Brent fell 1.8% to $45.77, part of a 4.7% weekly slide.The Permian in West Texas and southeastern New Mexico is the epicenter of low-cost production of U.S. shale oil and companies have been keeping an eye on deals to gain acreage in the prolific basin.In its September update Monday, the Energy Information Agency said production from the Permian will rise by 22,000 barrels a day this month to reach 1.999 million barrels a day in October. Production is seen falling in all other regions, including the Bakken and Eagle Ford basins.And exploration and production companies like Diamondback Energy (FANG), Concho Resources (CXO) and Parsley Energy (PE), and oil majors like Chevron (CVX) have focused their spending on resources in the play.Diamondback shares fell fell 0.2% to 89.69 after hitting 86.93 intraday. Concho closed up 4 cents at 125.39. Parsely rallied 1.8% higher.

130,OXY,"Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) is bullish about the Permian Basin and expects the rig count there to explode soon, while French oil giant Total (TOT) is cutting back investment.Pioneer Chief Executive Scott Sheffield told Bloomberg Thursday that 100 oil rigs could be added to the Permian in the next year. He also expects production in the region to grow by 300,000 barrels per day, per year.Last week, oil rigs in the Permian rose by two to 202, representing nearly half the 416 oil rigs in operation across the U.S., according to Baker Hughes (BHI) data.In its September update last week, the Energy Information Agency said production from the Permian will rise by 22,000 barrels a day this month to reach 2 million barrels a day in October. But production is seen falling in all other regions, including the Bakken and Eagle Ford basins.And Pioneer isn't the only one with eyes on the Permian. Noble Energy (NBL), Marathon Oil (MRO) and Occidental Petroleum (OXY) are reportedly considering offers for Silver Hill Energy Partners, which owns key assets in the basin.Pioneer shares ended 1.8% lower in the stock market today. Noble shares edged up 0.3%, Marathon shares rose 1.5% and Occidental dipped 0.5%.Earlier this month, EOG Resources (EOG) announced it would purchase privately held Yates Petroleum to expand its presence in the Permian. And in July, Diamondback Energy (FANG) bought $560 million worth of assets in the southern portion of the Permian.IBD'S TAKE: The Permian is the epicenter of low-cost production of U.S. shale oil and investors should look at shale oil companies with large assets in the Texas play. Read more about stock winners in the oil patch in the Industry Snapshot. Even oil major Chevron (CVX), which is the Permian's largest net acreage holder, is boosting its spending on unconventional plays, mostly in the Permian, and could double its outlays there to $3 billion by 2020, according to a BMO Capital Markets note out last week.But while interest in the Permian heats up, Total said it would cut overall investment to $15 billion-$17 billion a year next year down from $18 billion-$19 billion this year.The company still said it would boost output by 5% each year until 2020 and then 1% to 2% afterward.Chevron shares rose 0.35% and Total jumped 2.45%.RELATED:Iraq Says It's 'Right Time' For Production Cap; Oil Majors ReboundOil Falls As IEA Cuts 2016 Demand Forecast; U.S. Crude Below $45Permian-Focused Parsely, Laredo Benefit From Low-Cost Shale Center

131,OXY,"U.S. crude futures rose in volatile trade Wednesday morning after government figures showed higher U.S. crude stockpiles, but declining gasoline supplies and lower U.S. oil production. Earlier, Noble Energy (NBL)  and Occidental Petroleum (OXY) reacted to the recent plunge in oil prices.Crude stockpiles rose by 1.4 million barrels last week, the Energy Information Administration said Wednesday. Late Tuesday, the American Petroleum Institute, an industry group, said U.S. stockpiles fell by 1.3 million.But EIA also said production fell 0.6% to 8.46 million barrels per day, after rising in the prior week. And gasoline supplies fell by 3.3 million barrels, easing fears of a refined products glut.U.S. futures settled 3.3% higher at $40.83 a barrel. That follows a sharp drop from above $50 around mid-year. London-based Brent futures were up 3.2% at $43.12 a barrel.Meanwhile, before the market open, Noble Energy said it sees less oil production this quarter after a surge in Q2. Occidental Petroleum reduced its own output as it continues to cut back on certain operations, and crude prices tumbled back below $40 a barrel after U.S. crude inventories rose.IBD'S TAKE: U.S. crude's tumble below the key $40 per barrel support has shares of oil majors Chevron, Royal Dutch Shell and others further out of buy range.Noble Energy swung to a 24-cent per-share loss in Q2 from a profit of 26 cents per share in the year-earlier quarter. Analysts were expecting a loss of 29 cents a share. Revenue rose 16% to $847 million.Noble raised its full-year sales outlook by more than 7% to an average of 415,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. But for Q3, the company sees sales volumes of 405,000-415,000 barrels per day, down from 427,000 barrels in Q2, when volume jumped 43%.Shares fell 1.2% on the stock market today.Occidental swung to a Q2 loss of 18 cents per share, in line with analysts' views, from a gain of 21 cents per share a year earlier. Revenue fell 27% to $2.56 billion, under views for $2.66 billion.Occidental's production fell to 653,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day from 657,000 per day in Q1 and 658,000 a year ago, as the company continues to reduce non-core operations in the U.S. and Middle East.""Our strong balance sheet provides us with the flexibility to pursue attractive opportunities, including reinvesting in the business, while allowing us to deliver on our commitment of returning cash to our shareholders,"" CEO Vicki Hollub said in a release.But for the year, Occidental sees production growth at the high end of its 4%-6% forecast.Shares rose 1.2%.Continental Resources (CLR) closed up 4.8% at 44.48. But Continental fell slightly late after reporting a wider-than-expected loss.

132,OXY,"Shale producers Continental Resources (CLR), Oasis Petroleum (OAS) and Laredo Petroleum (LPI) all lifted their output forecasts as they reported earnings after the close Wednesday.Estimates: For Q2, the company was seen posted a loss of 17 cents per share vs. a 13-cent gain in the year-ago quarter. Revenue was seen plunging 30.3% to $554.8 million.Results: Adjusted loss of 18 cents a share on revenue of $451.2 million. Drilled but uncompleted well inventory in Bakken grew to 165, with expectation to end year with 190, down from view of 195 in Q1.Outlook: Full-year production view upped to 210,000-220,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day from 205,000-215,000.Shares were down 0.9% after hours in the stock market today.IBD'S TAKE: U.S. crude's tumble below the key $40 per barrel support has shares of oil majors Chevron, Royal Dutch Shell and others further out of buy range.Estimates: Analysts saw Oasis swinging to a 15-cents per-share loss from a gain of 38 cents per share a year ago. Revenue was expected to fall 19.5% to $185.3 million.Results: Adjusted loss of 11 cents a share on revenue of $179.1 million.Outlook: Full-year production view upped to 48,500-49,500  barrels of oil equivalent per day.Shares climbed 1.2% after hours.Estimates: The company's Q2 EPS was seen doubling to 10 cents but revenue was expected to fall to $138.3 million.Results: Adjusted EPS of 13 cents on revenue of $146.8 million.Outlook: Full-year production view upped to 17 million-17.3 million from 16.1 million-16.4 million. Q3 output seen at 4.2 million-4.4 million BOE.Shares climbed 2.2% late.Earlier Wednesday, Noble Energy (NBL) and Occidental Petroleum (OXY) reported results. Noble said it sees less oil production this quarter after a surge in Q2.

133,OXY,"Baidu (BIDU) suffered a ratings downgrade Monday, while U.S. oil producer Concho Resources (CXO) was upgraded, and Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) had its price target cut.The Chinese search giant Baidu was downgraded by Citi to neutral with a 180 price target.Last week, Baidu was among three China-based companies -- along with Tencent (TCEHY) and JD.com (JD) -- to each invest $50 million in Chinese car site Bitauto (BITA).Baidu shares lost 0.4% to 163.55 on the stock market today.Chipotle's price target was cut to 340 from 260 by Deutsche Bank, which said in a note that some customers ""may be lost for good"" following the E. coli outbreak last year.Moe's Southwest Grill beat out Chipotle as the most popular Mexican-style restaurant brand, according to a Harris Poll last week.Chipotle shares dropped intraday to their lowest level since August 2013, and fell 2.8% to 394.Concho Resources was upgraded to overweight by Morgan Stanley. The analysts also downgraded Occidental Petroleum (OXY) to equal-weight.Concho shares ticked down 0.1% to 119.67, while Occidental dipped 0.3% to 75.25.U.S. Silica Holdings (SLCA) was downgraded to neutral by D.A. Davidson. Shale companies like Continental Resources (CLR) have been using more sand to extract more oil, as the drop in prices has forced them to make wells more productive via enhanced completion techniques.U.S. Silica shares lost 3.9% to 32.26.

134,OXY,"Saudi Arabia's plan to boost market share and push out higher-cost producers like U.S. shale is working well, according to Aramco's CEO, with the statement coming as Hercules Offshore (HERO) announced a prepackaged bankruptcy plan Friday.Amin Nasser told Reuters that the state-owned company's market share is increasing year-over-year, but he didn't give exact figures.Saudi Arabia was behind the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries' decision to continue pumping crude oil instead of cutting supply to help raise prices. Iran disagrees with the plan and says that OPEC should regulate supply, but Tehran didn't agree to a production freeze that would have capped its own output at levels seen before the lifting of international sanctions.On Thursday, Dan Guffey, vice president of equity research at Stifel Nicolaus, told IBD that he wasn't sure Saudi Arabia could reach the 11 million to 11.5 million barrels they estimate by the end of the year. But a boost to output would have a very bearish effect on the market.Nasser expects prices to ""trend upward by the end of the year,"" as higher-cost production, like U.S. shale and deepwater projects, stall.Shale producers struggled in the first quarter, with Apache (APA) and Occidental Petroleum (OXY) reporting quarterly losses.But oil has been on the uptick in recent months from a low in January, even with Saudi Arabia and Iran boosting production, as more demand comes back.U.S. crude closed Friday at $49.33 a barrel, up 3.3% for the week after it briefly topped $50 intraday Thursday.Apache shares rose 0.45% in the stock market today. Occidental shares rose 4 cents to 76.15. Exxon Mobil (XOM) inched up 0.2%. BP (BP) was down 0.7%. Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) edged 0.6% lower. Chevron (CVX) shares climbed 0.5%.OPEC will meet Thursday to possibly continue talks of a freeze. Qatar’s energy minister told the AP that freeze talks could continue, as a minimum price of $65 per barrel is “badly needed at the moment.” The meeting will be Khalid al-Falih’s first as Saudi Arabia’s oil minister after Ali al-Naimi was removed from the post in April as part of the country’s “Saudi Vision 2030” economic reform plan.  Hercules announced a restructuring support agreement with its lenders as part of a prepackaged Chapter 11 plan. The company also said it will transfer the right to buy its Hercules Highlander, a jack-up rig, to a subsidiary of Maersk Drilling.Hercules shares plunged 47.4% to 1.02Meanwhile, Baker Hughes (BHI) said U.S. oil rigs fell by 2 to 316 this week, after stabilizing in the prior week.

135,OXY,"Diamondback Energy (FANG), Concho Resources (CXO), Continental Resources (CLR) and other U.S. exploration and production companies will report earnings this week, likely providing more information on capital spending, production outlooks and oilfield service costs.Senior Robert W. Baird oil and gas analyst Daniel Katzenberg said he expects some increases in production outlooks for the year and said any increases in output without a corresponding bump in capital spending would be major a confidence boost for investors.Liquids production from U.S. shale plays is expected to expand by 2.3 million barrels per day by 2022 at current prices, and could grow more if prices rise further, according to a new report from the International Energy Agency.The number of oil rigs in operation has swelled for 15 straight weeks, according to Baker Hughes data, suggesting continued U.S. production gains in the near future.Even oil majors like Chevron (CVX) and Exxon Mobil (CVX) have turned their investment focus to expanding their holdings in the Permian Basin while curtailing spending in other areas.But the IEA worries that U.S. production won't be enough to offset the decline in investment in conventional drilling as demand for crude grows.But questions remain about service costs. Katzenberg doesn't think cost inflation will be an issue for E&Ps until WTI crude hits $60 per barrel.He said the average estimate is for a 20% increase this year, but he's only forecasting a 10% increase as improvements in drilling will offset some of the cost increases.IBD'S TAKE: Q1 reports from U.S. E&P companies will shed some light on how innovative producers have become vs. how much they relied on discounts given by service providers during the crude price bust.""However, given investor trepidation, updated cost commentary, and its impact on 2017 plans, remains the biggest risk to the group over the earnings period, in our opinion,"" Katzenberg  wrote in note dated April 20.Diamondback Energy, Devon Energy (DVN) and ConocoPhillips (COP) are scheduled to release first-quarter results Tuesday. Continental, Laredo Petroleum (LPI), Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD), and Concho Resources (CXO) are on tap for Wednesday. Parsley Energy (PE) and Occidental Petroleum (OXY) will announce results Thursday.Analysts expect Parsley and Occidental to report profits, with revenue up 191.2% and 27.3% respectively.International oil majors BP (BP) and Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) will also report this week.RELATED: Exxon, Chevron Signal Stalling Investment As Oil Prices Lose Momentum

137,OXY,"XThe extension of a deal among OPEC and top non-OPEC countries to trim output isn't a foregone conclusion, Saudi Arabia reportedly warned top U.S. shale firms this week, in a sign that the No. 1 crude exporter's strategy to lift prices may be backfiring in the face of surging U.S. producers.In a closed-door meeting with executives from Anadarko Petroleum (APC), ConocoPhillips (COP), Occidental Petroleum (OXY), Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD), EOG Resources (EOG) and Newfield Exploration (NFX) on Tuesday, top Saudi officials said U.S. producers should ""not automatically assume OPEC will extend the cuts"" and that OPEC ""would not take the hit for the rise in U.S. shale production,"" an executive at the meeting told Reuters on Thursday.U.S. crude futures fell 2% to settle at $49.28 a barrel, its lowest close since November, after tumbling more than 5% Wednesday. Brent futures fell 1.7% to $52.19.Late last year, OPEC and non-members like Russia agreed to trim output by a collective 1.8 million barrels a day for the first six months of this year. While crude prices surged leading up to and immediately after the deal was reached, they later stayed sideways as U.S. companies rushed to add drilling rigs and crank up production.With the deal's upside fizzling out, OPEC member Iraq had starting talking about an extension when the agreement expires in June. And on Tuesday, Saudi Energy Minister Khalid Al-Falih appeared to lay out an initial, albeit tough, negotiating position.He told IHS' CERAWeek energy conference attendees Tuesday that ""conformity by all"" will be a criterion for any extension of the production-cut pact and that his country ""will not bear the burden of free rides"" as Saudi Arabia takes the brunt of the production cuts.Anadarko shares rose 0.9% to 61.94 on the stock market today. Conoco shares were up 1.2%. Occidental edged up 0.7%. Pioneer Natural climbed 1.9%. EOG was up 0.9%. Newfield jumped 1.9%.IBD'S TAKE: U.S. shale producers have ramped up spending and rig counts as oil prices rise and OPEC curbs production. But a debate is raging over how innovative producers have become vs. how much they relied on discounts. Failure to extend the agreement could send oil prices even lower, as U.S. companies have vowed to unleash a flood of investment this year to pump more oil from low-cost formations like the Permian Basin.On Tuesday, the Energy Information Administration raised its 2017 U.S. crude output forecast to 9.2 million barrels per day from a prior outlook of 8.98 million and raised its 2018 outlook to 9.73 million from 9.53 million. Last week, U.S. output hit 9.09 million barrels, the highest in a year and a half.Saudi Arabia's warning to U.S. shale comes despite strong compliance with the terms of the current agreement.Last month, OPEC Secretary General Mohammad Barkindo said he wants compliance on the output deal to rise past 90% to nearly 100%.But the high number is a collective figure and was due in part to Saudi Arabia cutting its output by more than it was expected, offsetting weaker compliance elsewhere.During an interview with CNBC after his speech, Al-Falih said Russia's cuts in February weren't enough but that Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak assured him that March cuts will be better.OPEC's next meeting is scheduled for May 25, and on March 26 a committee formed to monitor compliance with the production deal will meet in Kuwait.RELATED:Does OPEC Have Anything Left In The Tank As U.S. Shale Looms?This Is When Shell Expects Global Peak Oil DemandDow's Exxon Mobil, Royal Dutch Shell Announce Energy Deals As Oil Undercuts $50

138,OXY,"U.S. shale producers were the big winners of OPEC's decision Wednesday to cut production by 1.2 million barrels per day, but the deal won't immediately fix high debt loads, lack of skilled workers and other issues that shale producers need to resolve before ramping up production.West Texas Intermediate futures rose 3.3% to $51.06 a barrel on Thursday, the highest close since Oct. 19, after jumping 9% the day before. Brent futures rose as high as $54.53, the highest since July 2015.""There were casualties on capital spending  and future capital spending, so even though the war is over and welcomed by everyone, thinking the U.S. producers are going to ramp up production to where they were even a year ago is ill-conceived,"" said Phil Flynn, a senior market analyst at the Price Futures Group.Domestic crude production has edged up to the highest level in nearly six months, but Flynn thinks it will take a least a year before output really heats up in the U.S.""Companies are going to need more capital from banks, and it will be more difficult to borrow money because they have been burned in the past.""During the downturn, shale firms relied on bank loans or debt and stock sales to keep the lights on and rigs running.ConocoPhillips (COP) has said it would use cash from higher oil prices to first reduce debt before expanding operations. In May, EOG Resources (EOG) said it would first fund capital expenditures with cash flow, reduce net debt with property sales, and then complete drilled but uncompleted wells before starting to drill new wells.But Flynn said Conoco, Occidental Petroleum (OXY)and Oasis Petroleum (OAS) have a lot of capital and should be winners in the shale patch.Finding skilled workers and functioning equipment will be another major hurdle for the industry as rigs were retired or put in storage, and thousands of employees found other jobs after being laid off during the bust.Meanwhile, the latest surge in oil prices still isn't enough for many producers to jump back into the fray.Jason Wangler, managing director Wunderlich, told IBD oil would have to reach $60 per barrel before ""you'll see an absolute rush"" of producers ramping up activity. ""But $50 is a lot better than $40,"" and he expects U.S. shale companies' capital spending to be up 20% to 25% in 2017 vs. 2016.Last month, EOG said the U.S. shale industry needs oil prices of $60 a barrel to ramp up drilling.But Conoco, Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) and Devon Energy (DVN) will be able to boost activity at $50 per barrel, according to research company Wood Mackenzie in a Financial Times article.And costs are going up. Oil field service providers plan to roll back discounts offered during the depths of the price crash. In October, Halliburton (HAL) indicated that it was willing to increase its prices even if it means losing some customers.Still, technological advances have helped Continental Resources (CLR) reduce drilling time in the Bakken, and EOG has found a way to use cheap natural gas in fracking. But an estimated 80% of cost savings during the downturn came from service providers slashing costs.Shares of Continental Resources dipped 0.8% to close at 57.55 on the stock market today, but that's after surging 23% on Wednesday, breaking out of a cup with handle base. Occidental dipped  slightly to 71.27, Oasis ticked up 3 cents to 15. EOG climbed 2.2% to 104.75, above buy range, after jumping 11% Wednesday on the OPEC news. Halliburton added 0.3% to 53.24. Conoco lost 0.6% to 48.22 while Pioneer shares fell 0.8% to 189.57. Devon finished the day down 1% to 47.85.IBD'S TAKE: OPEC's announcement send shale stocks are soaring, see which shale plays are now buys.While rig counts have been rising in the Permian and Colorado's DJ Niobrara basin, Flynn said most of the recent rigs were added to replace rigs in decline or to hold leases.U.S. producers also could be hesitant to ramp up activity as the OPEC deal is contingent on Russia and other nonmembers scaling back output.The certainty of the deal was already in question Wednesday as Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak cautioned that Russia will ""gradually"" reduce due to technical issues. OPEC will meet with nonmembers to work out the details on Dec. 9.RELATED: U.S. Crude Production Hits Highest Level In Nearly 6 MonthsDover, Machinery Stocks Soar On Oil Prices, Infrastructure Hopes

Next year, the oil major sees $15 billion-$17 billion in spending.Shell still expects 2016 capital spending to be $29 billion, down 38.2% vs. 2014 levels. Looking ahead, Shell said capital investment for 2017 is expected to be $25 billion, at the low end of its $25 billion-$30 billion range.The company sees projects started this year adding more than 250,000 barrels of oil per day to production, but anticipates $50-per-barrel oil prices are here to stay.""We're planning next year on $50 a barrel,"" said CFO Simon Henry. ""We're planning the balance sheet for potentially even lower than that, and were building the portfolio to be robust at anything above $50 a barrel.""But oil prices are no longer above $50 a barrel.

140,OXY,"The U.S. rig count, which is already on the rise, is expected to jump next year, in contrast with the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, which is now trying to reduce its own output after pressuring U.S. companies to cut down.Rigs in operation will average 579 for 2017, up 29% from what's expected this year, according to a study out Wednesday by Platts RigData, a forecasting unit of S&P Global Platts. Analysts forecast 11,151 new wells to be drilled next year, up 25% from the 8,915 wells expected to be started this year.After collapsing last year, the U.S. oil rig count is heading back up and climbed by two to 418 in the week ended Sept. 23, marking the 15th gain in the last 17 weeks, according to Baker Hughes (BHI) data. Similarly, U.S. production has started to creep higher after a drawdown.Platts RigData expects capital spending this year to rise in the Anadarko Woodford, Marcellus/Utica, and Permian basins as exploration and production companies focus on ""highest-margin opportunities.""Spending is seen falling in the Bakken and Eagle Ford plays as companies keep capital spending targets steady, but drilling improvements and efficiencies have helped lower costs.""We have seen efficiency gains, like  high grading, and companies are able to do more with less as far as capex is concerned,"" said Jenna Delaney, senior energy analyst, Platts Analytics. ""They had to get creative to survive, and even though prices are only going to rise a fairly marginal amount next year, we would still see production rebounding.""IBD'S TAKE: The Permian is the epicenter of low-cost production of U.S. shale oil and investors should look at shale oil companies with large assets in the Texas play. Read more about stock winners in the oil patch in the Industry Snapshot. The Permian has been the focus of heavy acquisition interest lately.Noble Energy (NBL), Marathon Oil (MRO), and Occidental (OXY) are reportedly looking at offers for privately held Silver Hill Energy Partners.EOG Resources (EOG) said earlier this month it would buy Yates Petroleum to expand its presence in the Permian, and in July Diamondback Energy (FANG) bought $560 million worth of assets in the southern portion of the Permian.Chevron (CVX), the Permian's largest net acreage holder, could double its holdings there to $3 billion by 2020, according to a BMO Capital Markets note out earlier this month.Producers will also use their extra capital to finish drilled but uncompleted (DUC) wells. Platts RigData  said that DUC ""inventories may get depleted by between 950 to 1,200 wells this year.""The rise in U.S. rig counts comes as OPEC and other top producers agreed to limit production starting in November, according to Reuters.OPEC members are discussing concessions where Saudi Arabia would cut 400,000 barrels a day from its production, which hit 10.6 million barrels  a day in August, and Iran would cap production at 3.7 million barrels, the Wall Street Journal reported earlier, below the presanction level of about 4 million Tehran has said it is targeting.""If OPEC actually curtails production obviously that is going to be supportive of prices, and the rig count tends to track what the price of oil does,"" said Trey Cowan, Senior Industry Analyst, Platts RigData.Shares of Noble Energy climbed 4.55% in the stock market today on news of the OPEC agreement. Marathon jumped 8%, Occidental gain 4.7%, EOG 6%, Diamondback 5.5% and Chevron 3.2%.RELATED:

173,OXY,"Continental Resources (CLR) CEO Harold Hamm said he wouldn’t consider adding drilling rigs until oil prices reach $60 a barrel, and the first rigs could be headed to North Dakota.The price is higher than what others have said would spark more drilling. Pioneer Resources (PXD) said last week it would add five to 10 drilling rigs when oil hits $50 a barrel. Some analysts have put the price at $45-$55. U.S. crude futures rose 1.2% to $44.32 a barrel.But the usually brash Hamm sounded more cautious on a conference call Thursday, saying he wants to see a sustainable price recovery before adding rigs and that drilled but uncompleted wells would first be brought online.""It will be some time before we think about bringing on more rigs,"" he said.Continental shares jumped 13.9% on the stock market today, after reporting late Wednesday that its Q1 adjusted per-share loss widened to 41 cents from 9 cents a year ago, missing views by 4 cents. Revenue from crude oil and natgas sales fell 30.7% to $403.6 million, below views of $441.22 million. But Continental boosted its 2016 output guidance.EOG Resources (EOG) said late Thursday that it swung to an adjusted loss of 83 cents a share, beating estimates by a penny, from a year-ago profit of 3 cents a share. Revenue fell 41.6% to $1.35 billion, below forecasts of $1.67 billion.When asked about the Bakken’s prospects in the long term as it competes for capital against newer plays like the Stack and Scoop plays in Oklahoma, Hamm said that assets in the older play would be more valuable in the future. But management said it was looking at the possibility of selling some of its non-core assets.Meanwhile, other oil and gas producers continue to raise production outlooks after first-quarter results.Occidental Petroleum's (OXY) loss, adjusted to account for discontinued operations and non-recurring gains, was 56 cents per share, swinging from a gain of 4 cents a year ago. Analysts were expecting a loss of 40 cents a share. Revenue fell 26.5% to $2.28 billion, below analyst estimates of $2.35 billion.But the company said its Permian production rose 30% year over year while operating costs in the area fell 33%. Total oil and gas operating costs were 23% lower.Occidental also raised its full-year production growth outlook for the year to 4%-6%. Occidental shares climbed 3%.Elsewhere, Apache's (APA) adjusted loss widened to 40 cents per share. Analysts were expecting a loss of 89 cents a share. Revenue fell 35% to $1.05 billion, under views for $1.1 billion.Apache shares tacked on 8%. The company drilled and completed 47 gross-operated wells in its North America on shore operations in the first quarter.""Apache's first-quarter performance was characterized by notable achievements in operations, drilling and further cost reductions. Despite a continued decline in our drilling activities, we delivered strong production results in North America Onshore,"" said Chief Executive John Christmann IV. ""Results in the Permian Basin were particularly strong with solid performance from our base production and very good results from maintenance projects and new drilling.""He said drilling and completion costs in key onshore plays were down 45% from 2014.Apache raised its full-year 2016 North American onshore production outlook to 268,000-278,000 barrels per day, up from an earlier outlook of 263,000-273,000 barrels.But Jason Wangler, a managing director at Wunderlich, told Investor's Business Daily earlier that most companies gave low production guidance in the fourth quarter in the hopes of beating it and drilling activity wouldn't start increasing  until oil hits $50-$55 per barrel for a sustained period.Exxon Mobil (XOM) also said Thursday it is teaming up with FuelCell Energy (FCEL) to develop new fuel cells to capture carbon emissions.The companies are working on creating technology that would lessen carbon dioxide emissions from natural gas power plants and other large emitters.""Carbon capture configuration has the added benefit of eliminating approximately 70% of the smog-producing nitrogen oxide generated by the combustion process of these large-scale power plants,"" said FuelCell Chief Executive Chip Bottone.Exxon shares edged up 0.1%.

207,OXY,"That's significant because the key to Athlon's growth since its founding has been management's grasp of the 70,000-square-mile Permian, which stretches from western Texas into the southeast corner of New Mexico.

"
267,OXY,"On Jun 26, U.S. crude price moved above $70 for the first time in more than a month. Several factors contributed to this increase, though all of them emanated from supply concerns. Reports emerged that the United States is urging countries to stop importing oil from Iran by November. Meanwhile, uncertainty hovered over the fate of Libyan crude supplies.Further, concerns have emerged over Saudi Arabia’s ability to step up production at a pace quick enough to combat supply shortages. The temporary closure of a production facility in Canada also served to boost U.S. prices. With no end to the sector’s supply concerns in sight, investing in oil stocks looks like a profitable option.Iran, Libya Crude Supplies Under CloudOn Tuesday, WTI crude increased 3.6% to close at $70.53 a barrel, the highest finish recorded since May 24. Brent crude also gained 2.1% to close at $76.31 a barrel, a near two-week high. Such gains came on the back of multiple factors boosting supply concerns.According to a report by The Wall Street Journal, the United States wants all countries to stop importing oil from Iran by Nov 4. This is part of the United States’ efforts to isolate the country economically and politically, per a senior U.S. State Department official.Major purchasers of Iranian crude were expecting the United States to allow them to reduce such oil imports over an extended period. But the Trump administration has no plans of issuing any waivers for countries that are making efforts to cut Iranian oil imports.Meanwhile, a cloud is hovering over Libyan crude supplies. According to a report from Reuters, forces led by Eastern Libya’s military commander Khalifa Haftar have handed over control of the country’s eastern oil ports to a National Oil Corporation (NOC) based in the east. The internationally recognized NOC has dismissed the move, terming it as illegal.Saudi Concerns, Syncrude Breakdown Boost PricesAccording to Bloomberg, Saudi Arabia is preparing to boost crude production to a record level in July. The oil-rich country plans to produce 10.8 million barrels a day starting next month, which exceeds the earlier all-time high of 10.72 million barrels a day recorded in November 2016. The move would be in accordance with the recent agreement concluded between OPEC and its allies.But analysts feel that this report implies that oil prices can only move higher. If Saudi Arabia does pump oil at an all-time high level, it will cross its production quota and place the excess in storage.However, such a move comes at a time when global spare production capacity is languishing near all-time lows. This means that the country may not be confident enough about boosting production at a pace that is enough to make up for a likely shortfall.Also boosting oil prices on Tuesday was the temporary closure of Canada-based oil-sands facility Syncrude. Loss of power led to a shutdown on Jun 20 and even though power has been restored since then, no shipments have been forthcoming as of now. Since the facility produces 360,000 barrels of crude a day, the disruption has also contributed to the spike in oil prices.Our ChoicesMultiple supply concerns are serving to boost crude prices at this moment. While temporary disruptions like Syncrude are unlikely to leave a long-term impact, the United States’ tough stance on Iranian imports could lead to prolonged supply concerns.The situation in Libya is also likely to remain unpredictable. Meanwhile, questions surround Saudi Arabia’s ability to boost production quickly.  Investing in stocks of oil companies looks like a smart option at this point.

268,OXY,"Eni SpA (E  -  Free Report) discovered oil in the southern part of Block 15/06, located in the Kalimba exploration prospect, offshore Angola.The new find is estimated to hold light oil between 230 million and 300 million barrels in place. So far, the license was primarily estimated to hold gas but the discovery has provided prospects for oil exploration. The discovery is likely to boost the potential value in the block.Located about 150 kilometers off the coast and 50 kilometers south east from the Armada Olombendo FPSO (East Hub), the Kalimba-1 NFW well was drilled by the West Gemini drillship. The well was drilled to a total depth of 1901 meters in a water depth of 458 meters.The drilling of Kalimba-1 NFW confirmed a 23 meters net oil pay of high quality oil (33° API) enclosed in Upper Miocene sandstones with outstanding petrophysical properties. The data obtained from Kalimba-1 NFW indicates production capacity of more than 5,000 barrels of oil per day.Eni, the operator of Kalimba-1 NFW well, holds a stake of 36.8%. The other partners are Sonangol P&P and SSI Fifteen Limited, holding 36.8% and 26.4%, respectively. The co-venturers will operate to evaluate the updip of the discovery and will begin the studies to accelerate its development.Currently, two oil development projects — West Hub and East Hub — are producing about 150,000 barrels of oil per day (bopd) (100%) in Block 15/06. Eni also operates the Cabinda Norte Block, located onshore Angola.In 2018, a number of start-ups are expected in block 15/06, including the Upper Miocene, the East Hub and the Subsea Boosting System for the Mpungi field. The Vandumbu field is expected to come online earlier than expected at the end of 2018 and will be linked to the West Hub. The overall production from Block 15/06 will be augmented by 30,000 barrels of oil with these start-ups and the figure will be more than 170,000 bopd gross in 2019.Angola takes an important place in Eni’s organic growth plans. The company’s presence in the country dates back to 1980. Currently, the company’s equity production in the country is about 155,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.Price PerformanceIn the past three months, Eni’s shares have gained 2.6% compared with the industry’s 6.6% rise. Zacks Rank & Other Key PicksEni currently sportsa Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).A few other top-ranked players in the same sector are Occidental Petroleum Corporation (OXY  -  Free Report) and China Petroleum and Chemical Corporation (SNP  -  Free Report) as well as CVR Refining, LP (CVRR  -  Free Report).

269,OXY,"Occidental Petroleum Corporation’s (OXY  -  Free Report) Board of Directors announced the company’s regular quarterly dividend of 78 cents per share, which annually stands at $3.12. The figure reflects a 1.3% hike compared with the previous annual rate of $3.08 per share.Details of the Dividend RaiseThe quarterly dividend of 78 cents per share is payable Oct 15, 2018 to shareholders of record as of Sep 10, 2018. The company has been consistently paying quarterly dividend since 1975.The board members of Occidental Petroleum have been clearing annual dividend hikes for more than a decade now. Notably, yearly payout increases are becoming a steady policy for this Oil and Gas integrated major. The company’s latest move marks the 16th consecutive year of dividend raise.The current annualized dividend yield is 3.7% compared with the S&P 500 average of 1.8%. This rise in distributable income vouches for the company’s strong balance sheet and a constant cash flow position, providing it with financial flexibility and a cushion for incremental dividend.Can Occidental Petroleum Sustain Dividend Increases?Occidental Petroleum's continued focus on the Permian Resources has been beneficial for the company. Permian production grew 18,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d) sequentially to 177,000 boe/d in the first quarter. The output from this region is expected to improve further from the current levels, courtesy of the new wells added to this region in 2018. Occidental Petroleum expects production from this area in the range of 198,000-210,000 boe/d in 2018, which will further boost margins.In the first quarter, capital expenditures were $1,032 million, of which, $574 million were invested in the Permian Resources. A substantial portion of its planned 2018 capex will be directed toward the same to further strengthen its operation in the region.Occidental Petroleum hatched a strategic plan to divest lower-margin, lower-return oil and gas production and replace it with higher-margin, higher-return production from the Permian Resources business.We believe, the company’s strong cash flow, concentration on Permian Resources and organic growth will help generate sufficient funds to meet its financial commitments.Dividend Hikes in the Same SpaceOccidental Petroleum is not the only company to reward its shareholders with increased dividend. There are also other players in the same sector to add shareholder value.For instance, TOTAL S.A. (TOT  -  Free Report) announced the final dividend of 62 cents per share on Jun 1, 2018, bringing the annual dividend to $2.48, registering a 1.2% raise compared with the annual dividend amount paid in the previous year.On Feb 7, 2018, Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (APC  -  Free Report) approved a quarterly hike in cash dividend of 25 cents per share, payable to shareholders by a staggering 400% compared with the previous quarter’s payout of 5 cents.Also, on Feb 7, 2018, Suncor Energy Inc.’s (SU  -  Free Report) board cleared a 12.5% hike in quarterly dividend of 36 cents per share, payable Mar 26, 2018 to shareholders holding scripts as on record date.Price MovementOccidental Petroleum’s stock has surged about 41.4% in the past year compared with Zacks Oil and Gas – Integrated industry’s rally of 24%.Zacks RankOccidental Petroleum currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

270,OXY,"ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report) has received consent from board of directors for increasing share repurchase program for 2018 by 50% to $3 billion from $2 billion. In 2018, the company will have sufficient cash from operations to fund the program along with dividend and capital expenditures.Currently, the company has a total share repurchase authorization of $6 billion. The 2018 share repurchase program expansion to $3 billion along with shares repurchased worth $3 billion during 2016 and 2017, will fully utilize the board’s existing authorization. Therefore, the board has authorized additional share repurchases of $9 billion, taking the total amount to $15 billion.In late 2016, ConocoPhillips had commenced the current share repurchase program. The $15-billion authorization reflects about 20% of the total shares outstanding as of Sep 30, 2016. This comprises shares already repurchased under this program as well as future repurchases based on the current share price.ConocoPhillips also announced that it has reduced debt by $2.1 billion during the second quarter and has attained declared debt target of $15 billion much before the original target date of 2019 end.The board of directors holds the discretionary power to execute the repurchase authorization. The level or rate of activity may be impacted by future earnings, financial condition, capital requirements, levels of indebtedness, credit ratings and other considerations that are relevant.These initiatives emphasize the company’s commitment toward boosting shareholders’ value. It also highlights the fact that the company projects upside potential in shares. As the company achieved the target of meeting debt before the targeted date, ConocoPhillips can focus on channeling cash flows toward business growth and maintain efficiency in operations.As oil and gas prices continue to recover, several oil giants have reinitiated share repurchase program, which is intended to increase shareholders’ value.

EagleClaw is a portfolio company of Blackstone Energy Partners.The PHP project, estimated at $2 billion, will provide a channel to transport the increased natural gas production from the Permian Basin to emerging market areas along the Texas Gulf Coast. The project is intended to transfer about 2 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d) of natural gas from the Waha area, Texas, to the U.S. Gulf Coast and Mexico markets, via a 42-inch pipeline of about 430 miles. The project is anticipated to come online by late 2020.Kinder Morgan is also appraising the economic and hydraulic viability of a 48-inch pipeline with increased transportation capacity owing to enhanced interest of producers.The PHP Project will receive natural gas supply from numerous locations, including Kinder Morgan’s, EagleClaw’s and Apache’s existing systems in the Permian Basin with additional interconnections to intrastate and interstate pipeline systems in the Waha area. The PHP Project will hold the supply on Kinder Morgan’s intrastate pipeline systems in the market area.Thereafter, the supply will be delivered to various markets, including the Katy market hub, the Agua Dulce market hub, the Coastal Bend and Kinder Morgan Tejas headers connected to the Freeport LNG export facility, the Cheniere header linked to the Cheniere Corpus Christi LNG export facility as well as several pipelines along the Texas Gulf Coast.Initially, Kinder Morgan and EagleClaw will be equal partners in the PHP Project holding 50% each. Apache, who has been jointly developing the planned project, will have the option to purchase about 33% equity in the project from the initial partners.Apache and EagleClaw will be the primary shippers on the planned pipeline, with Apache proposing to consign about 500,000 dekatherms per day.

272,OXY,"SM Energy Company (SM  -  Free Report) released operational updates for the second quarter of 2018 and announced higher-than-expected production guidance.The company expects higher-than-expected production volumes, primarily owing to outstanding operational results at the Midland Basin, wherein  performance of new and existing wells was better than expected. The company expects production in the range of 10.1-10.4 million barrels of oil equivalent (MMBoe) or 111-114 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (MBoe/d), showing a rise from 9.7-10.1 MMBoe (106-111 MBoe/d). Of the total production, about 41% will comprise oil.Operational efficiencies have enabled the ramp up of the 2018 Midland program. SM Energy continued to drill and complete wells earlier than anticipated through this plan. Consequently, a few operations in numerous pads are anticipated to be accelerated in the third quarter. This will boost production volumes in the third quarter. The bulk of capital related to the completion of these wells will be spent in the second quarter.Improved operational efficiencies have enabled the company to supervise three completions crews in the Midland Basin, compared with five engaged through May. Eventually, SM Energy is likely to lower active rig count in the Midland Basin to seven.Moreover, SM Energy has concluded main construction of water handling infrastructure project in the Midland Basin, investing the bulk of estimated infrastructure capital in the first half of 2018.Higher level of activity in the first half of the year leads to the projection that about 60-65% of the total 2018 capital budget will be spent in the first half of 2018 or about 5% of the original budget is accelerated into the first half of the year. Cost inflation is a persistent obstruction to the company's original plan in February. Therefore, second-quarter capital spend is estimated in the range of $400-440 million, while total capital spend guidance for 2018 remains unchanged at about $1.27 billion.Price PerformanceIn the past three months, SM Energy’s shares have gained 34% compared with the industry’s 8.6% rise. Zacks Rank & Key PicksSM Energy currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked players in the same sector are Occidental Petroleum Corporation (OXY  -  Free Report), Eni SpA (E  -  Free Report) and CVR Refining, LP (CVRR  -  Free Report).

273,OXY,"Petróleo Brasileiro S.A. or Petrobras (PBR  -  Free Report) recently lost a wage lawsuit when Brazil’s Labor Court voted in favor of the workers of Petrobras seeking higher wages. This is notably the biggest lawsuit that the company has faced in the Brazil’s Labor Court, which is expected to cost the company around 17 billion reals or 4.5 billion in U.S. dollars.The case is mainly centered on the Minimum Remuneration Level Regime (RMNR) policy, adopted by Petrobras in 2007. The employees argue that the payments related to special working conditions such as night shifts and hazardous working environment should not be included in the base wage calculation, which will thus lead Petrobras to make additional payment to comply with RMNR. In contrast, the company is of the opinion that such payments should be included in the base wage calculations itself.The ruling in favor of the workers is likely to result in wage increase of around 35% for 59,000 employees. Petrobras intends to appeal the decision in the Supreme Federal Court.Of late, Petrobras has been going through a really tough time with the resignation of the company’s CEO, Pedro Parente. Petrobras has been thrown into disarray, with its shares falling sharply. The departure of Parente has raised speculations that the country may resort back to its old fuel pricing of subsidies that may again hamper the company’s growth and economy.Early this month, the Brazilian Federal court suspended Petrobras’ $7-billion TAG sale deal with Engie SA, jeopardizing its 2017-2018 divestment goals of $21 billion. The latest lawsuit defeat comes as another huge blow to the company, which is grappling with high debt burden.Zacks Rank and Key PicksCurrently, Petrobras has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Petroleo Brasileiro S.A.- Petrobras Price Petroleo Brasileiro S.A.- Petrobras Price | Petroleo Brasileiro S.A.- Petrobras QuoteSome better-ranked stocks in the oil and energy sector are Cheniere Energy, Inc.

275,OXY,"By now, the year 2018 can easily be credited to trade tensions. In the first half, the two countries targeted $50 billion of each other’s goods for tit-for tat tariffs. But now, the situation has deteriorated with President Trump’s latest threat of 10% tariffs on further $200 billion in products imported from China.Trump has even gone on to say that if Beijing continues to retaliate, the United States will impose a total tariff on $550 billion in Chinese goods – an amount that was not even the total U.S. import from China last year.Now, if any broader investing spectrum falls prey to such political tensions, then that will be the large caps. Though the large-cap index S&P 500 started 2018 on a better footing than the Russell 2000, the game started changing from mid-March. President Trump’s protectionist agenda and the resultant trade war fears started weighing on large-cap stocks.Trade War Fear Seems Oversold, Time to Look at Better Data Points?Investors should note that after a nagging four-month trade war talks, investors seem to be ignoring the reality in July. U.S. stock futures are trading at a five-month high currently. This is especially true given that Chinese and U.S. officials have lately hinted at the prospect of recommencing talks over trade between the two countries.Three big ETFs including SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY  -  Free Report), SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (DIA  -  Free Report) and Invesco QQQ ETF (QQQ  -  Free Report) have added about 0.9%, 1.2% and 1.5%, respectively, in the past five days (as of Jul 12, 2018).Investors also shifted focus to upbeat U.S. economic data points from the trade war. U.S. employers added 213,000 new jobs in June, after an upwardly revised 244,000 in May. The number breezed past market expectations of 195,000. The momentum in the manufacturing sector is equally upbeat with the sector logging the strongest expansion in four months in June.If this was not enough, U.S. retail sales rose the maximum in six months in May. Sales increased 0.8% sequentially in the month, after an upwardly revised 0.4% growth in April, handily beating market expectations of a 0.4% rise.Earnings Growth Momentum SolidEarnings for the S&P 500 index are expected to be up 19.1% in Q2 on 8.2% higher revenues, per the Earnings Trends issued on Jul 11.  Investors should note that the present earnings cycle for the S&P 500 started from 2009, when the U.S. economy came out of its last recession.By now, the growth momentum should have slowed and reached the historical normalized pace of the mid-single-digits’ level. But an expected double-digit growth rate for Q2 earnings is the result of the tax reform, per the Earnings Trends.The Atlanta Fed estimates real GDP growth in the second quarter of 2018 to be 3.8%, much higher than the 2.0% rate recorded in Q1. The combination of these factors should continue to boost growth stocks.Why Large Caps?Having said this, while all sorts of growth ETFs may scale higher, large-caps are likely to enjoy some special benefits. This is because, large-caps have been subdued this year on trade concerns, resulting in cheaper valuation.Secondly, large-cap stocks perform better in a falling dollar environment as these have wide foreign exposure. Along with many analysts, we too believe that “tariffs, rising debt and deficits” may put a downward pressure on the greenback. This could bode well for large-cap stocks.Given this, we have highlighted a few top-ranked, large-cap growth stocks for investors.

After receiving the required consents, the transaction is expected to be completed in a number of series, mostly in the second half of 2018. In the coming quarters, Weatherford proposes to divest remaining land drilling rigs via a series of smaller sales.The funds raised from the transaction will be used to lower debt burden of the company, which amounted $7.6 billion as of Mar 31, 2018.In late 2017, Reuters reported that Weatherford had appointed advisors, including Morgan Stanley, to ease the high debt burden by disposing some units. The asset divestment was scheduled to begin in the first quarter of 2018.

278,OXY,"The hottest commodity oil has been on a solid run this year thanks to a tightening oil market and rising global demand. Rounds of news about new supply disruption are adding strength to the oil price, making the case for energy stocks appealing.Supply DecliningThe looming Iran sanctions and falling Libya and Venezuela output were the biggest catalysts in driving oil price lately. The United States is expected to halt oil exports from the fifth-biggest producer Iran by November though some waivers can be granted while production in Libya has halved in five months to 527,000 barrels per day. Venezuela’s worsening economic crisis has forced the country to curtail its output to below 2 million barrels per day, which has been halved since 2005.Now, the strike by hundreds of workers on Norwegian offshore oil and gas rigs has led to the shutdown of one shell-operated oilfield and escalated supply worries. A Canadian production outage at the 360,000-bpd Syncrude oil sands facility has reduced flows into Cushing, OK and is expected to continue doing so till September.The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and other top crude producers, agreed to raise output by about 1 million barrels per day from July in order to offset global production losses in countries including Libya and Venezuela. However, the move will not be able to make up for higher demand thus pushing the price higher.Demand RisingGlobal demand for oil has been picking up buoyed by improving economic growth since the financial crisis and continued to be strong during the peak summer season.However, demand from China may be curtailed by Trump’s tariff threats. President Donald Trump has threatened to levy new trade tariffs of 10% on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods, a move that will intensify trade tensions between the world’s two biggest economies.Other FactorsOngoing geopolitical tension in the Middle East is also supporting the oil price. Further, the oil futures market is in a state of backwardation, where later-dated contracts are cheaper than near-term contracts. This signals that the oil market is tightening and demand is robust, paving the way for an oil rally. This trend is likely to persist at least in the near term, acting as the biggest catalyst for the commodity.Earnings OptimismPer the latest Earnings Trends report, the energy sector remains the largest contributor to Q2 S&P 500 earnings, having projected more than double the growth from the year-ago level at 138.2%. In fact, full-year earnings are expected to grow 101.7%.Given the barrage of bullish trends, energy stocks are set to explode higher heading into the Q2 earnings season.

282,OXY,"Equinor ASA (EQNR  -  Free Report) and Martifer Renewables have inked an agreement to acquisition of a 50% interest in the Guanizul 2A (G2A) solar asset in Argentina. The other 50% is being purchased by Scatec Solar, a Norwegian independent solar power producer.Located in the San Juan region of Argentina, the G2A asset is a 117 MW ready-to-build solar project. During the December 2017 RenovAr auction, held by CAMMESA — the Argentinian Electricity Regulatory Agency — the asset received a 20-year electricity offtake agreement (PPA) with a fixed price equivalent to ~50 USD/MWh.The project, which has a potential to provide renewable energy to about 80,000 Argentine households, is expected to commence production toward the end of 2019.

Moreover, earnings are expected to register 2.4% growth in 2019.Solid Growth DriversThe integrated energy company has a strong portfolio of upstream projects, which have been backing impressive production growth. Through 2016 and 2017, BP has placed 12 key upstream projects online. All these developments drove the company’s record first-quarter 2018 production. Notably, since the October-to-December quarter of 2010, first-quarter output has been the highest. Additionally, the January-March quarter output marked an increase in production for six quarters in a row. Through 2021, BP expects production to grow at 5% per annum.BP plans to add six key upstream projects through 2018. Among the new developments for 2018, Atoll in Egypt and Shah Deniz 2 gas development in Azerbaijan have commenced production. All the upstream projects that are either placed into operation or are yet to start will boost BP’s production by 900 thousand barrel of oil equivalent per day (MBOE/D) by 2021.BP believes in active optimization of its portfolio. The company tries to create value over the long-term by finding ways to grow inorganically. For example, the company’s transaction in the Norwegian North Sea to form AkerBP as well as the merger of BP and Bridas assets to create Argentina’s largest private integrated oil and gas company — Pan American Energy Group or PAEG — emphasize its commitment to enhance shareholders’ value.BP’s strategic partnership with Russia’s largest oil company, Rosneft, wherein it holds 19.75%, allows the company to manipulate the strategic direction as well as gain from a diverse set of existing and potential projects in the nation’s oil and gas sector. Currently, BP’s daily equity production in the country is 3.6 million barrels with an estimated 18.4 billion barrels of proved oil reserves, equivalent to 13.7 years of reserve life. Moreover, the company has reserves of 48 billion barrels across its upstream resource, which provides ample scope for growth through the next decade.The company also proposes to invest about half a billion dollars annually in Alternative Energy business. This is in line with the company’s current focus to lower emissions. In this respect, BP plans to diversify by investing in Lightsource BP, Clean Energy, Fulcrum, and Butamax among others.Other Key PicksA few other top-ranked players in the same sector are Occidental Petroleum Corporation (OXY  -  Free Report), China Petroleum & Chemical Corporation (SNP  -  Free Report) or Sinopec, and CVR Refining, LP (CVRR  -  Free Report).

The transaction is expected to close by the end of third-quarter 2018.Update on Denmark SaleHess, as the operator of the South Arne Field in Denmark, decided to retain its interest of 61.5% in the field as the offers received for the earlier announced sale did not meet expectations. However, the company will continue to seek strategic options for this asset in the normal course of business.Divestment RationaleHess has been divesting non-core assets to focus on projects which will benefit the company in the long run. The company is planning to allocate the proceeds from the sale toward offshore Guyana project. Till date, Hess has made seven world-class oil discoveries at the Stabroek Block, located off the coast of Guyana. Hess raised gross recoverable resources projection to 3.2 billion barrels of oil equivalent (boe) from 2.25-2.75 billion boe. The company expects production from offshore Guyana’s Liza prospects to commence by 2020.Hess is also among the leading producers of crude in the Bakken oil shale play in North Dakota. The company has interests in the best areas of the plays.Price PerformanceIn the past three months, Hess’ shares have surged 37.9% compared with the industry’s 23.1% rally. Zacks Rank & Other Key PicksHess currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).A few other top-ranked players in the same sector are Occidental Petroleum Corporation (OXY  -  Free Report) and China Petroleum and Chemical Corporation (SNP  -  Free Report), also known as Sinopec.

288,OXY,"West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude recently touched the $75-a-barrel psychological mark, showing a more than 186% improvement from February 2016 when the commodity had hit its lowest level of $26.21 since 2003. The surge in oil price is definitely a boon for upstream and midstream businesses of integrated energy companies.Healthy crude price will likely convince energy players to ramp up production in domestic shale plays. From storing and transporting new oil volumes, integrated energy firms are expected to get additional fee-based revenues from shippers.Moreover, the abundance of natural gas in the United States following the shale revolution will continue to back the integrated energy firms’ chemical/downstream activities since the players’ petrochemical crackers should benefit from cheaper natural gas feedstocks like ethane instead of naphtha — which is derived from the pricier crude.Industry Rewards Shareholders with Huge ReturnsLooking at shareholder returns over the past year, it appears that the crude price recovery was enough for boosting investors’ confidence in the industry’s prospects. The Zacks Oil & Gas-US Integrated Industry, part of the broader Zacks Oil and Energy Sector, has outperformed both the S&P 500 and its sector over the past year. We can see that stocks in this industry have collectively gained 44.3% over the past year, while the Zacks S&P 500 Composite and Zacks Oil and Energy Sector have rallied a respective 14.2% and 18.7%.One-Year Price PerformancePlenty of Room to RunIn order to determine the value of the oil sector, we have used the trailing 12-month Enterprise Multiple. This is because oil energy players typically shoulder significant debt pertaining to investments in growth projects and EV includes debt for valuing company or industry.Enterprise Multiple = Enterprise Value (EV)/EBITDAThe industry currently has a trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA ratio of 9.09. When compared with the highest level of 10.49 over that period, there is apparently room for more upside.Enterprise Value/EBITDA Ratio (TTM) The space also looks cheap when compared with the market at large, as the trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA ratio for the S&P 500 is 11.48 and the median level is 11.38.  Comparing the group’s EV/EBITDA ratio with that of its broader sector shows that the industry is trading at a considerable premium. In fact, the solid business potential has convinced investors to persistently pay premium for the industry as compared to the broader sector over the past few years.  Enterprise Value/EBITDA Ratio (TTM) Outperformance May Sustain on Strong Earnings OutlookPer our proprietary model, the industry’s trailing 12-month free cashflow as of Dec 31, 2017 was $6.4 billion, significantly up from $542 million in 2016. This reflects that the industry has sufficient cashflow left for financing growth projects without the need to rely on debt and equity capital.Moreover, the industry has considerable lower exposure to debt as compared to the S&P 500. This is reflected in the industry’s debt-to-capitalization ratio of 34.7% against the S&P 500’s 47.2%. Hence, apart from adequate free cashflow, the industry has sufficient space for sponsoring future developments by debt capital if need arises. While the ratio analysis shows that there is a solid value-oriented path ahead, one should not really consider the current price levels as good entry points unless there are convincing reasons to predict a rebound in the near term. One reliable measure that can help investors understand the industry’s prospects for a solid price performance is the earnings outlook for its member companies. Empirical research shows that a company’s earnings outlook significantly influences its stock performance.The Price & Consensus chart for the industry shows the market's evolving bottom-up earnings expectations for it as well as the industry's aggregate stock market performance. The red line in the chart represents the Zacks measure of consensus earnings expectations for 2019 while the light blue line represents the same for 2018.Price and Consensus: Zacks US IntegratedIndustry This becomes clearer by focusing on the aggregate bottom-up EPS revision trend. The chart below shows the evolution of aggregate consensus expectations for 2018.Please note that the $2.69 EPS estimate for the industry for 2018 is not the actual bottom-up dollar estimate for every company within the Zacks Oil & Gas-US Integrated Industry but rather an illustrative aggregate number created by our proprietary analytics model. The key factor to keep in mind is not the industry’s earnings per share for 2018 but how this estimate has evolved recently.Current Fiscal Year EPS Estimate Revisions As you can see here, the $2.69 EPS estimate for 2018 is up from $2.03 at the end of April and 55 cents at the end of August 2017. In other words, the sell-side analysts covering the companies in the Zacks US integrated industry have been steadily raising their estimates.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Solid ProspectsThe group’s Zacks Industry Rank is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all member stocks.The Zacks Oil & Gas-US Integrated Industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #18, placing it in the top 7% of more than 250 Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.On top of that, our proprietary Heat Map shows that the industry’s rank has been in the top 50% for the past eight weeks with an overall steady upward trend.The solid near-term prospects are strengthened further by the recovery in top and bottom lines that integrated energy firms have been showing since the start of 2017.Revenues: Zacks US Integrated IndustryNet Income: Zacks US Integrated IndustryBottom LineProspects for upstream businesses seem promising as the current crude rally is expected to continue on numerous factors.Possibility of higher oil output from Saudi Arabia and Russia will not be able to offset global supply concerns emanating from Venezuela’s supply and Iran’s sanction issues. This is constantly driving WTI crude price. On top of that, a booming domestic economy, as reflected from robust job additions and the increase in labor force participation rate, is fueling the oil rally.  Midstream businesses are also picking up pace given the mounting demand for new pipeline networks in the domestic shale plays. Also, integrated energy firms are investing in petrochemical crackers in the Gulf Coast areas for capitalizing on cheap domestic natural gas feedstocks like ethane.Overall, it seems to be the ideal time to bet on four integrated energy companies with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and positive earnings estimate revisions.ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report): This Houston, TX-based firm has gained 66% over the past year.

290,OXY,"It commonly happens in stock investing that investors miss the chance of buying winning stocks that they knew would stand out.

291,OXY,"After three years, Enbridge Inc (ENB  -  Free Report), Enbridge Energy Partners, L.P. (EEP  -  Free Report) and Enbridge Income Fund Holdings Inc have received approval to proceed with Line 3 Replacement Project. The news has annoyed protestors who believe that the project is a threat to pristine areas. The protestors will continue to express their dissent and use regulatory methods to disrupt the project.The Minnesota Public Utilities Commission (PUC) has given Enbridge a Certificate of Need for the project. Despite protests from various sectors, PUC’s decision was based on the worsening condition of the existing line, built in the 1960s.PUC approved Enbridge's line and incorporated minor alterations and certain conditions. The replacement of Line 3 will include a new passage in its path. Currently, the pipeline extends from Alberta, Canada, moves through North Dakota and Minnesota to Enbridge's terminal in Superior, WI.It has been highly debated whether refineries in Minnesota and Midwest need additional oil. Currently, Enbridge runs Line 3 at about 50% of its original capacity of 760,000 barrels per day for security reasons and transports only light crude.Per the project’s antagonists, including the Minnesota Department of Commerce, the refineries need the additional oil as demand will fall in the coming years when people switch to electric cars and renewable energy sources. Eventually, the oil will be exported.The decision has not made any impact on the cost estimate of the Line 3 Replacement project.  The cost is projected at $5.3 billion in Canada and $2.9 billion in the United States with about $3.6 billion of capital spent till date. Enbridge reiterated that the project will be brought online in the second half of 2019.The project indicates the company's low-risk business profile and long-term cash flow stability.

293,OXY,"Equinor ASA (EQNR  -  Free Report) intends to acquire 100% of the shares in Danish energy trading company, Danske Commodities (DC). Per the agreement, Equinor will pay EUR 400 million in smaller contingent payments, subject to Danske’s performance over the next couple of years.About Danske CommoditiesFounded in 2004, Danske Commodities is based in Aarhus, Denmark, with a workforce of 284 employees. The company is active in short-term gas trading and offers energy market services. In 2017, the company dealt in 318 terawatt hours of electricity with 37 countries. This corresponds to more than two times of Norway’s electricity consumption per year. Danske also traded 389 terawatt hours of gas across 18 countries, which is equal to about 33% of the total Norwegian gas production. It executes more than 4000 trades and processes about 173 terabytes of data on a daily basis, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.On completion of the acquisition, Danske will be led by the existing CEO Henrik Lind for a minimum of 12 months.  The senior management group will also remain unchanged.Acquisition RationaleThe company rebranded itself as Equinor from Statoil as they wanted to remove oil from the name. This is a recent trend followed by many energy players, which is in sync with the global move to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.The latest acquisition underlines the above-mentioned strategy of the company to broaden offerings. Equinor intends to move from being an upstream oil and gas company to becoming a broad energy company. The company proposes to create a significant position in renewable energy and anticipates investing 15-20% of its capital expenditure in new energy solutions by 2030.The transaction will allow both Equinor and Danske to create value along the complete electricity value chain by gaining from competencies of both.

It has amassed assets over $702.24 M, making it one of the average sized ETFs attempting to match the Large Cap Value segment of the US equity market.Why Large Cap ValueLarge cap companies typically have a market capitalization above $10 billion. They tend to be stable companies with predictable cash flows and are usually less volatile than mid and small cap companies.Value stocks have lower than average price-to-earnings and price-to-book ratios. They also have lower than average sales and earnings growth rates. Considering long-term performance, value stocks have outperformed growth stocks in almost all markets; however, they are more likely to underperform growth stocks in strong bull markets.CostsWhen considering an ETF's total return, expense ratios are an important factor, and cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive counterparts in the long term if all other factors remain equal.Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.35%, putting it on par with most peer products in the space.It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 3.01%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsWhile ETFs offer diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk, a deep look into a fund's holdings is a valuable exercise. And, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Utilities sector--about 24.70% of the portfolio. Financials and Consumer Discretionary round out the top three.Looking at individual holdings, Duke Energy Corp. (DUK  -  Free Report) accounts for about 1.56% of total assets, followed by Occidental Petroleum Corp (OXY  -  Free Report) and Xcel Energy Inc.

296,OXY,"On Jun 22, a congregation of OPEC (Oil and Petroleum Exporting Countries) countries and non- OPEC allies will assemble in Vienna to take a decision regarding an 18-month old agreement to curb output in order to support global oil prices.Notably, Saudi Arabia and Russia are extremely eager to dissolve the production barrier. However, some OPEC members, especially Iran, Iraq, Venezuela and Iraq are in favor of maintaining status quo.Supply Concerns of Iran and VenezuelaIssues related to Iran stem from the United States’ withdrawal from the nuclear pact and plans of re-imposing sanctions the country. Iran currently exports around 2.5 million barrels of oil a day, reflecting around 4% of world’s total supply. The U.S. sanctions will reduce its oil export to around 1 million barrels per day.Meanwhile, Venezuela is plagued with economic instability, massive debt load, unrest in the workforce and hyperinflation. These factors are likely to take severe toll on the country’s oil production till the end of 2018. In fact, oil exploration has reached at its lowest level in 30 years and is far below the level of strategic cuts required by the OPEC.These two major oil exporters and some other oil countries suffering production inefficiencies like Iraq are vehemently opposing the removal of output restrictions. More oil production means lower oil prices. This implies that the oil revenues of Iran and Venezuela will be hurt significantly. Consequently, this will hamper the economic well-being of these countries.Saudi Arabia and Russia to Increase Oil ProductionsThe two global oil behemoths both in terms of oil reserve and export, Saudi Arabia and Russia, are in favor of elimination of output restrictions even if that means lower oil prices. These two countries want to increase oil supply by 1.5 million-barrels-a-day. These two countries can easily ramp up oil production and increase revenues through higher volume sales by gaining market share from other OPEC and non-OPEC partners.However, an anonymous OPEC source has hinted that OPEC and Russia will finally opt for a compromise which will result in an increase of oil supply 300,000 to 600,000 barrels a day, much lower than 1.5 million barrels a day.Likely Effect on U.S. Oil CompaniesSeveral industry experts firmly believe that OPEC will only compensate the shortage originating from Venezuela or Iran and some other countries. However, the largest oil production cartel will keep international oil production levels intact.Higher oil prices will be major boon for the U.S. oil exploration industry. The U.S. shale production of crude oil is currently going on in full swing. Crude oil production touched a new weekly high of 10.8 million barrels a day and is poised to hit 12 million barrels a day in 2019 making United States the world’s largest crude oil producer.  Although China has imposed tariffs on U.S. crude, strong global demand for oil will enable the United States to seek out a substitute for China which accounts for 20% of U.S. oil exports. Higher oil price and higher volume sales will significantly increase revenues of oil majors.Major beneficiaries will be  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM  -  Free Report), Chevron Corp. (CVX  -  Free Report), Occidental Petroleum Corp. (OXY  -  Free Report) and ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report) to name a few. Chevron and Occidental carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The chart below depicts price performance of above-mentioned four stocks in the last three months.Bottom LineThe U.S. stock markets are facing severe volatility in 2018 primarily due to concern about global trade war, geopolitical conflicts and inflationary fears. Notably, the technology and energy are the two sectors which are providing stability to market fluctuations. However, the tech sector by its nature depends on successful new product innovation while energy sector has a stable footing. Consequently, oil price surge may act as a major catalyst to bring back sustained market momentum.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

307,OXY,"Oil prices surged on Jun 7, as investor concerns prevailed over an impending supply shortage from Iran, gradually declining output from Venezuela and a longer-term picture of tighter supply from OPEC (Oil and Petroleum Exporting Countries) and non-OPEC allies led by Russia.Notably, oil prices had plummeted on Jun 6, following the U.S. Energy Information Association (EIA) report that domestic crude has registered its lowest finish in almost two months for the week ended Jun 1. Crude oil production touched a new weekly high of 10.8 million barrels a day, which is almost close to making United States the world’s biggest crude oil producer.  Increase in U.S. oil supply may compel OPEC and non-OPEC allies led by Russia to abide by a global pact on cutting oil supplies until the end of 2018. Investors’ fear of global oil shortage helped crude prices recover yesterday. At this stage, investment in energy stocks engaged in oil production, refining and marketing will be a lucrative option.Oil Prices RecoverOn Jun 7, the WTI crude rose $1.22 or 1.9%, to settle at $65.95 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent futures for August settlement rose $1.96 or 2.6% to end the session at $77.32 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The global benchmark crude traded $9.29 higher than the WTI.Supply Concerns From Iran and VenezuelaAt present, Venezuela and Iran are the major supply disturbances. Economic instability in Venezuela, its massive debt load, unrest in workforce and hyperinflation will take a severe toll on the country’s oil production till the end of 2018. According to Reuters, the country is embroiled in an oil supply crisis, with a delay of nearly a month in delivering oil to its customers from its main export terminals.However, problems related to Iran started after the United States withdrew from the nuclear pact and announced plans to re-impose oil sanctions on it. The U.S. government also warned about the possibility of secondary sanctions imposed on European companies that continue to deal with Iran. Research firm Commerzbank reported that several European oil companies have announced plans to withdraw from Iran in order to avoid the risk of U.S. sanctions.Our Top PicksStrong international demand for crude oil, a tight global oil inventories and stabilization of oil production level will boost oil price rally in the near term.

309,OXY,"Oil prices trickled down on Jun 6, with the U.S. benchmark crude registering its lowest finish in almost two months. The decline in oil prices can be primarily attributed to a surprise increase in weekly U.S. crude oil inventories. Yet, oil has been one of the best performing sectors over the last few months and is poised for growth.Understandably, geopolitical tensions have kept oil prices in focus over the last few weeks, with the United States imposing sanctions on Iraq. Moreover, a deep economic crisis in Venezuela has pushed oil production down, with its ports struggling to ship enough crude.So much so, that crude oil exports from Venezuela are almost a month behind schedule due to a backlog in the country’s ports. That said, oil prices have been rising over the last few months, which makes for a good time to invest in oil stocks.Oil Prices Fall on Climb in Weekly Domestic InventoriesOil prices fell unexpectedly on Jun 6, on reports of a rise in weekly domestic crude inventories. The WTI Crude Oil declined 1.2% to end at $64.73 per barrel, registering its lowest finish in almost two months. Also, the benchmark Brent Crude oil fell 0.7% to settle at $75.36 a barrel.Moreover, the Energy Information Association (EIA) figures reflect a huge jump in U.S. oil production, escalating 2.1 million barrels for the week ended Jun 1. Crude oil production touched a new weekly high of 10.8 million barrels a day, which is almost close to making United States the world’s biggest crude oil producer.  The rise in supply may compel OPEC members to go against plans of increasing production by a million barrels. Crude oil has been performing well over the last few months with the S&P 500 Energy Select Sector SPDR (XLE) growing 12.1% in the last three months. On a year-to-date basis, the sector has grown 5%.Geopolitical Tensions to Boost Prices?Growing geopolitical tensions have brought crude oil back in focus again. Earlier last month, President Donald Trump withdrew from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal and imposed sanctions on that country. This immediately led to fears of a rise in oil prices. Imposition of sanctions means Iran could cut down on its oil production thus impacting oil exports. Moreover, United States’ sanctions over Venezuela coupled with that country’s ongoing economic crisis could further impact oil prices. Venezuela is embroiled in an oil supply crisis, with a delay of nearly a month in delivering oil to its customers from its main export terminals. The crisis comes at a time when OPEC is maintaining production controls that it has put in place since last year.Our ChoicesThe recent fall in oil price might just be temporary as data shows a surprise climb in weekly domestic crude inventories. Given this scenario, it makes good sense to invest in crude oil stocks.However, picking winning stocks may be difficult. We have narrowed down our search to the following stocks based on a good Zacks Rank and other relevant metrics.Wildhorse Resource Development Corporation (WRD  -  Free Report) is an oil and natural gas company. It focused on the acquisition, exploration, development and production of oil, natural gas and NGL. The company has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

310,OXY,"With releases from 409 S&P 500 members, the Q1 earnings season is at its tail end. The companies recorded year-over-year earnings growth of 24% on 9.3% higher revenues.Around 78% of the S&P 500 companies surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings, while 75.6% beat revenue estimates. Notably, 63.3% surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for both earnings and revenues.Energy to Outperform OthersThe elite S&P 500 index is expected to see year-over-year earnings growth of 23.2% in Q1. This growth estimate represents the January to March quarter as a whole, including the companies that have already reported results and have yet to report earnings.Energy will likely be the key sector backing the index’s outperformance. Excluding Energy, earnings of S&P 500 are expected to decline to 21.5% from 23.2%. In fact, the latest Earnings Preview shows that Energy will outshine all sectors with earnings growth of 73.9%.Favorable Oil Supports EnergyThe favorable crude pricing scenario primarily supported Energy’s outperformance. For the first three months of 2018, oil traded at an average monthly price of $63.70, $62.23, and $62.73 per barrel, respectively. The average monthly price of the commodity never touched $60 through 2015 to 2017. It was the production cut extension deal by the OPEC players through 2018-end that mainly drove the rally in crude.The fate of all the energy players is related to the movement of oil price. Exploration and production companies will likely gain from the crude rally. Also, drillers and oilfield service companies are expected to gain more contacts from explorers. Midstream energy companies, engaged in transporting and storing of oil and refined petroleum products, will likely record more fee-based revenues from shippers transporting the increased production.It is to be noted that for January and February of 2018, crude production in the domestic field was recorded at 310,138 thousand barrels and 287,379, respectively — representing a year-over-year improvement from 273,673 and 253,623.Oil Stocks to WatchWe have chosen four energy players gearing up to report first-quarter 2018 results on May 8.Headquartered in Denver, CO, Cimarex Energy Co. (XEC  -  Free Report) managed to surpass the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in each of the last four quarters, the average positive surprise being 13.3%.Our proven model does not show a beat for Cimarex this earnings season.

313,OXY,"Equinor ASA (EQNR  -  Free Report) along with its partners is contemplating the idea of supplying power from land to three platforms. These include Troll C and the Sleipner field center that comprises the Gudrun tie-in platform in the North Sea.Currently, these three platforms are powered by gas turbines. The company is planning to lower CO2 emissions by more than 600,000 tons annually from Troll C and the Sleipner area.Platform electrification is expected to cut CO2 emission by 365,000 tons annually on Troll C. Electrification of the Sleipner field center and Gudrun has the potential for lowering emissions by 250,000 tons annually. NOx emissions might also be lowered, owing to electrification of these platforms by about 2500 tons annually.Electrification of major offshore oil and gas installations from land is a highly complicated task. Apart from numerous hindrances, technical and financial, many of its installations are in areas with no option for tying in to land-based power supply.However, the electrification plan follows Equinor’s appraisal on its own-operated Norwegian Continental Shelf (NCS) fields. The study identified Troll C and the Sleipner field center, including the Gudrun platform, as the most appropriate electrification candidates for further consideration. These platforms can utilize existing power supply infrastructure and can save large resources, which will lead to significant CO2 reductions.Going forward, Equinor intends to power Johan Sverdrup field along with several fields on the Utsira High, including the Gina Krog field from land. This is in line with the company’sstrategy to work on fields with minimal emissions.Profitability is important in achieving success in such projects. Moreover, support from the Business Sectors NOx fund will play a vital role.The partnership is required to carry out analysis before it can decide on the electrification of Troll C and Sleipner field center.The electrification plans involve close cooperation between Equinor, partners and authorities to ascertain good solutions from a technical and financial viewpoint.To reap long-term benefits on the NCS, the company must focus on reducingCO2 from its operations. In 2017, Equinor attained its goal of lowering annual CO2 emissions from the NCS by 1.2 million tons, almost three years ahead of schedule. Consequently, the company raised its goal and targets to lower CO2 emissions from its offshore operations by another 2 million tons per year by 2030.Zacks Rank & Other Key PicksEquinor currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).A few other top-ranked players in the same sector are Occidental Petroleum Corp. (OXY  -  Free Report), China Petroleum and Chemical Corp. (SNP  -  Free Report) and CVR Refining, LP (CVRR  -  Free Report). These stocks sport a Zacks Rank #1.

314,OXY,"Wall Street is finally showing signs of stabilizing despite the lingering presence of destabilizing elements. For the week ended Jun 8, all three major indexes – The Dow 30, S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite – closed in the positive territory. Robust first-quarter 2018 earnings and strong fundamentals of the U.S. economy foreshadow the persistence of uptrend in stock markets.Robust labor market data for May, recovery of il prices due to supply concern, anticipation of interest rate hike by the Fed which will bode well for the financial sector and easing of trade war fear are primary reasons behind the stabilization of the markets. Major indexes are likely to maintain their northbound movement in the near term. Consequently investment in growth stocks with favorable Zacks Rank will be a prudent move.Wall Street’s Big Weekly GainFor the week ended Jun 8, the Dow 30 increased 2.8%, its biggest weekly gain since March. Notably, the index closed at 25,316.53, on Jun 8. This was blue-chip index’s highest level of closing since Mar 12. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite recorded weekly gains of 1.6% and 1.2%, respectively. These reflect third straight weekly advances for both indexes.Strong weekly gains have placed all three indexes in the green year to date. The Dow 30, S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite are up 2.4%, 3.9% and 10.8%, respectively.Robust Earnings Momentum   First-quarter earnings results have been exhibiting strong momentum so far. Total earnings are up 24.4% from the same period last year on 8.7% higher revenues. This is the highest quarterly earnings growth pace in seven years.For the second quarter, total earnings for the S&P 500 index are expected to be up 17.9% on 7.9% higher revenues. For full-year 2018, total earnings for the S&P 500 index are anticipated to be up 19.6% on 6% higher revenues. (Read more: Looking Ahead to the Q2 Earnings Season)Oil Prices RecoverOil prices recovered in June after plunging in May following the news that Saudi Arabia, other OPEC (Oil and Petroleum Exporting Countries) countries, and non-OPEC allies led by Russia are likely to abide by a global pact on cutting oil supplies until the end of 2018. Strong international demand for crude oil, an impending supply shortage from Iran if the Trump administration imposes sanctions and a gradually declining output from Venezuela will bolster oil prices in the near term.Trade War Fear OverblownIt seems that investors have decided not to attach too much significance to the G-7 summit which took place in Canada on Friday. A strong U.S. macro economy allowed investors to shrug off G-7 trade conflicts.Meanwhile, China has offered to purchase nearly $70 billion of U.S. farm and energy products if the United States refrains from imposing further tariffs on the country. Moreover, President Trump is scheduled to meet his North Korean counterpart Kim Jong-Un on Jun 12 in Singapore to reach an amicable solution about North Korea’s nuclear ambitions.Our Top PicksStock markets momentum remained largely unhindered despite recent volatility.

315,OXY,"Diamondback Energy Inc.’s (FANG  -  Free Report) strong foothold in the prolific Permian Basin has been quite a boon to the company’s performance for a while. Notably, the shares of this Texas-based upstream player have increased 30% over a year, outperforming the industry’s growth of 13.5%.On the flip side, infrastructural bottlenecks in the shale play still remain a concern. That said, let’s do a close introspection of the company’s performance and see if it can add more laurels to its growth story.The Permian AdvantageDiamondback’s strategic acreage position in the low-cost Permian Basin bodes well. The low operating cost stems from the region's extensive pipeline infrastructure, plentiful labor and supplies, and relatively warm winters that make year-round work possible. The Permian pure-play company holds around 207,000 net acres in the region, including 188,000 net acres in the Midland and Delaware Basins. Its activities are concentrated in the Wolfcamp, Spraberry, Clearfork, Bone Spring and Cline formations.Diamondback recently delivered its 12th consecutive earnings outperformance, driven by its phenomenal production growth. Owing to its significant resource potential and prime acreage holdings, the company’s first-quarter output recorded a year-over-year and sequential increase of 66.5% and 10.5%, respectively.Driven by the robust results, the company raised the lower end of its 2018 production guidance from 108-116 Mboe/d to 110-116 Mboe/d. For 2018, it is now targeting an annual output growth of 40% within cash flow.Effective Growth StrategiesA deep inventory of horizontal development opportunities in both the Midland and Delaware sides of the Permian Basin bodes well. The company’s strategy of horizontal drilling and increased well density maximizes its productivity. Notably, the lateral length of its wells that was less than 4,000 feet in 2012 is likely to jump to around 9,300 feet by this year, owing to the technological advancements. Diamondback targets around 170-190 horizontal completions in 2018, which will boost its production prospects as the wells become operational. The company also plans to add two more rigs in 2018, increasing its operational rigs by 20% from the last year.Diamondback is also making continual efforts to convert its undeveloped reserves to developed ones, which is aiding its cash flows further. In 2017, the company’s proved reserves increased around 63% to stand at 335,352 thousand barrels of oil-equivalent (MBoe). In fact, it achieved a remarkable 52% CAGR in its total reserves since 2013.The energy explorer also has an impressive record in purchasing leasehold position, which further spurs its organic growth and bolsters Permian foothold.The low-cost development strategy is another positive for the company. It has been gaining from the economies of scale and operational efficiencies, thereby maximizing its earnings growth. In the last reported quarter, its cash operating costs were down 10% on a year-over-year basis to stand at $8.42 per barrels of oil equivalent. Diamondback also improved its cost outlook by lowering the lease operating expenses guidance for 2018 by 13% to reflect increased efficiencies.  Cash Flow Generation Bodes WellDiamondback Energy’s cost efficiencies, disciplined capital management and employing more equity financing than debt boosted the financials of the company. Notably, the company generated free cash flow of $21 million in the last reported quarter, while generating 13% annualized return on the capital employed. As a show of confidence in its cash flow generating ability, it also initiated its dividend payout program in the first quarter.Its return on equity for the trailing 12 months is 10.53%, higher than the industry’s figure of 6.07%. Finally, Diamondback’s manageable debt-to-capital ratio of 22.9% is lower than most of its peers, providing it with enough financial flexibility to tap the strategic growth opportunities.Signs of ConcernWhile production in the Permian is soaring, the takeaway capacity is not increasing in proportion. Due to pipeline capacity constraints, Diamondback Energy and other producers have to sell their products at a discounted rate. Though the company is entering into agreements to improve pricing exposure, the impact of the same is unlikely to be immediate. While Diamondback inked a deal to secure 50 thousand barrels per day of capacity for the Gray Oak pipeline, the project is not expected to become operational till late 2019, providing no immediate respite from the concerns.Also, while the company’s financials are otherwise strong, there is one area of concern in the balance sheet with respect to its cash position. Notably, cash and cash equivalents of the company decreased 35.5% in the last reported quarter. As it is, Diamondback’s current ratio of 0.53 compares with 1.06 for its broader industry, which is low both in absolute and relative terms. This may lead to difficulties in meeting its current obligations.Bottom LineDespite the above-mentioned hurdles, we believe that the company’s top-tier acreage in the Permian, cost-containment and growth initiatives, healthy cash flow generation, along with a rebounding energy landscape will enable Diamondback to counter the limitations.Zacks Rank and Key PicksDiamondback currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold)Some better-ranked stocks in the oil and energy sector are Cheniere Energy, Inc. (LNG  -  Free Report), Occidental Petroleum Corporation (OXY  -  Free Report) and Oasis Petroleum Inc., (OAS  -  Free Report) each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

317,OXY,"Occidental Petroleum Corporation (OXY  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results after the market closes on May 8. In the fourth quarter, the oil and gas company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 2.50%.Let’s see how things are shaping up before this earnings announcement.Factors to ConsiderOccidental Petroleum expects first-quarter production to be in the range of 592,000-603,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d) and Permian Resources output within 169,000-173,000 boe/d.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter average daily production is pegged at 601,000 boe/d, reflecting year-over-year growth of 2.9%. This is within Occidental Petroleum’s guided range.First-quarter production of the company will be adversely impacted by the January freezing weather, which lowered output by 2,000 boe/d.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues and earnings for the quarter under review stands at $3,696 million and 71 cents, respectively, reflecting growth of 24.1% and 373.3% from the year-ago reported quarter.Occidental Petroleum Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Occidental Petroleum Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Occidental Petroleum Corporation Quote Earnings WhisperOur proven model shows that Occidental Petroleum is unlikely to beat estimates in the to-be-reported quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

318,OXY,"Petroleo Brasileiro S.A. or Petrobras’ (PBR  -  Free Report) 2017-2018 divestment plans could be in jeopardy, as the Brazilian Federal court suspended the company’s $7-billion deal with Engie SA. The court recently passed a ruling against the sale of Petrobras’ natural gas pipeline unit, Transportadora Associada de Gás (TAG) to France-based Engie SA.The company had announced the sale of its wholly-owned subsidiary, TAG, last year. TAG’s gas pipeline system spanning 4,500 kilometers is primarily located in the north and northeast of Brazil. It can transport up to 74.7 million cubic feet per day, which is fully contracted through long-term agreements with ship-or-pay clauses.The court halted the transaction due to discrepancies in the way Petrobras advanced with the sale. It is believed that the sale was not publicized well enough to stimulate ample competition. Petrobras is taking necessary legal steps to protect the interest of its shareholders.The sale of TAG is major part of Petrobras’ divestiture program of 2017-2018. The company plans to sell assets worth $21 billion over the said time frame. These divestment plans are in sync with the company’s strategy to reduce its debt burden, and reinstate its investment grade rating and financial health. Further, it will also help the company gain additional liquidity, as it intends to increase investment in the ultra-deepwater projects.As it is, with the resignation of the company’s CEO, Pedro Parente, Petrobras has been thrown into disarray, with its shares falling sharply. The departure of Parente has raised speculations that the country may resort back to its old fuel pricing of subsidies that may again hamper the company’s growth and economy. Moreover, with this latest unpleasant news about the suspension of $7 billion divestment deal, Petrobras might have a tough time ahead.Zacks Rank and Key PicksCurrently, Petrobras has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Petroleo Brasileiro S.A.- Petrobras Price  Petroleo Brasileiro S.A.- Petrobras Price | Petroleo Brasileiro S.A.- Petrobras QuoteSome better-ranked stocks in the oil and energy sector are Cheniere Energy, Inc.

319,OXY,"Are U.S. stock markets finally stabilizing after being plagued by extreme volatility in the last three months? The answer seems to be in the affirmative. Two major indexes – S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite - are trending upwards for four consecutive trading days. Barring minor fluctuations on Tuesday, the Dow 30 index has also been largely trading in the green for trailing four days.Robust labor market data for May, easing of trade war fears, tech stock boom and hike in the U.S. government bond yields resulting in gain for the banking sector are the primary reasons behind this encouraging performance of stocks. These positives are likely to remain constant in the near-term and consequently investment in momentum stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank will be a prudent move.Indexes Moving NorthOn Jun 6, the Dow 30 closed at 25,146.39, after gaining 346.41 points or 1.4%. This was blue-chip index’s highest level of closing since Mar 12. Likewise, the benchmark S&P 500 closed at 2,772.35, up 0.9% reflecting its highest level of closing since Mar 12.The teach-heavy Nasdaq Composite closed at 7,689.24, up 0.7%. The index also recorded its third consecutive all-time closing high after hitting a fresh record high for the first time in almost three months on Jun 4.Robust Labor Market DataOn Jun 1, The Department of Labor reported that the U.S. economy added 223,000 jobs in May, exceeding the consensus estimate of 190,000. The unemployment rate declined from 3.9% in April to 3.8% in May, the lowest in 18 years. The decline in the unemployment rate indicates the extent to which the labor market has tightened. However, most economists think job additions will continue and that the unemployment rate will decline further. (Read more: Unemployment Falls to 18-Year Low: 6 Winning Picks)Trade War Fear EasesAccording to a report by ABC News, on Jun 4, the U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin urged President Donald Trump to exempt Canada from metal tariffs during a trade meeting. The U.S. government has imposed 25% tariff on steel and 10% on aluminum on Canadian imports since Jun 1.  Meanwhile, China has offered to purchase nearly $70 billion of U.S. farm and energy products if the United States refrains from imposing further tariffs on the country. Moreover, President Trump is scheduled to meet his North Korean counterpart Kim Jong-Un on Jun 12 in Singapore to reach an amicable solution about North Korea’s nuclear ambitions.Bank Stocks Gain on Higher Bond YieldsOn Jun 6, the yield on 10-year U.S. Treasury Note rose 5.9 basis points to 2.975%, its highest since May 24. The hike in U.S. government bond yield is a result of strong sell off of Eurozone bonds following a senior European Central Bank (ECB) official’s remark that the ECB remained on track to debate next week the timetable for ending its monthly bond purchase scheme.Hike in bond yield was also supported by the market sentiment that the Fed will raise interest rate as labor market is tightening and wage growth will result in inflation. In May, wages increased by 2.7% year over year after remaining unchanged at 2.6% for three consecutive months. The slow increase in wage gains is also serving to cool inflationary fears.The major gainer of a rate hike is the banking sector. Yesterday, the stock price of Bank of America, Morgan Stanley, Citigroup and The Goldman Sachs Group increased 3.2%, 2.2%, 2.2% and 1.7%, respectively.Our Top PicksA healthy labor market, gradual fading out of trade conflict and an impending rate hike along with a strong U.S. economy will help stock market bull-run to continue. At this stage, investment in stocks with strong earnings momentum will be lucrative. Our selection is backed by a good Zacks Momentum Score and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

320,OXY,"Royal Dutch Shell plc (RDS.A  -  Free Report) recently divested its entire stake in Oman’s Mukhaizna oilfield to India’s largest oil company, Indian Oil Corporation. The European oil giant sold its entire 17% interest in the oil field to IOCL Singapore PTE Ltd — a wholly-owned subsidiary of Indian Oil — for a total consideration of $329 million.The majority stakeholder in the Mukhaizna field is Occidental Mukhaizna LLC, a subsidiary of Occidental Petroleum Corporation (OXY  -  Free Report), which owns 45% stake. Other partners in the field include Oman Oil Company, Liwa Energy Limited, TOTAL E&P Oman, a subsidiary of TOTAL S.A. (TOT  -  Free Report), and Partex (Oman) Corporation, each holding 20%, 15%, 2% and 1% stakes, respectively.Mukhaizna oilfield, being the largest oilfield in Oman, accounts for 13 per cent of the total oil production of 120,000 barrels per day in the nation. The deal marks the first upstream acquisition of Indian Oil in Oman that is likely to enhance its global footprint and growth opportunities in the Middle East region, along with bolstering India’s energy security.The move will help Shell proceed with its $30 billion divestment program. The deal provides the company with a major uplift in its drive to decrease debt, following the acquisition of BG Group for $47 billion. The divestment is expected to reduce the company’s cost and enhance cash flow, as well as return to capital. The deal will also help the company to upgrade and streamline its upstream portfolio.With Shell already wrapping up divestment deals worth more than $23 billion, it remains focused to meet its target by 2018. Further, the company announced asset disposals amounting to around $2 billion and talks for prospective transactions of additional $5 billion divestment deals are already in advanced stages.Headquartered in Netherlands, Shell is one of the largest integrated energy companies engaged in the production, refining, distribution, and marketing of oil and natural gas.

321,OXY,"Royal Dutch Shell plc (RDS.A  -  Free Report) recently selected Gretchen Watkins as the new President for the company’s North American operations, effective Jan 1, 2019. Watkins will replace the current President and Executive Vice President of Unconventionals. Both of them will be stepping down this year, with Watkins eventually assuming both the roles. She will supervise the sprawling U.S. operations that include wells and refineries from the Gulf of Mexico to Pacific Northwest.On Jul 1, 2018, Watkins will replace Greg Guidry as Shell’s executive vice president of unconventionals. Eventually, the current Shell U.S. County Chair and President, Bruce Culpepper will also step down on Dec 31, 2018 and be succeeded by Watkins. Both Culpepper and Guidry have had been veterans in the company working for 37 and 36 years, respectively.Watkins joined Maersk Oil in 2014 as the COO and was elected as the CEO of the company in 2016. She left the company after its acquisition by the supermajor TOTAL S.A. (TOT  -  Free Report). Prior to joining Maersk Oil, she served as the vice President of Houston-based Marathon Oil Corporation.Surprisingly, only about 20% workforce in the oil industry is female, representing one of the lowest ratios among major industries. While women account for nearly 30% of the workforce in Big Oil companies including ExxonMobil and BP plc (BP  -  Free Report), new disclosures from such companies reveal major gender pay disparity, with females getting paid less by at least 20% on an average, owing to the lack of women at the upper wrung positions.Notably, Vicki Hollub is currently the highest-ranking female executive among the major oil companies, being the President and CEO of Occidental Petroleum Corporation (OXY  -  Free Report). While the Big Oil companies have women CFO’s and a few female Presidents in some of their divisions, Hollub remains the only woman CEO among major publicly-traded oil companies. In fact, under Hollub’s leadership, Occidental emerged as the top producer in the Permian Basin, leaving behind biggies like ExxonMobil and Chevron Corporation. Notably, gender diversity in the upper echelons of the companies can boost the financial performance and innovative capacity of the firms, according to studies.Some top female executives in major energy companies include Sara Ortwein — President of XTO Energy, a subsidiary of ExxonMobil and Stacy Olson — President of Chevron Appalachia, among few others.The Anglo-Dutch oil giant is the latest supermajor to announce the appointment of a female executive, after BP named Susan Dio as the chairman and president of its vast operations in the United States on Mar 20, 2018. With Susan Dio’s election, BP will hand over the reins of responsibility of its vital U.S. operations to a woman for the first time. She will succeed John Minge who had been leading the company’s U.S. business since early 2013. Notably, both Shell and BP carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank  (Strong Buy) stocks here.While certain companies have gradually started making strides to move toward gender parity in the workforce, there’s still much scope for progress in the arena. With two supermajors naming a woman to a president position within the span of a week, it may prompt more energy companies to promote women in top leadership positions in coming period.    Can Hackers Put Money INTO Your Portfolio?Earlier this month, credit bureau Equifax announced a massive data breach affecting 2 out of every 3 Americans.

322,OXY,"Have you been paying attention to shares of Occidental Petroleum (OXY  -  Free Report)? Shares have been on the move with the stock up 9.4% over the past month. OXY hit a new 52-week high of $87.17 in the previous session. Occidental Petroleum has gained 16.1% since the start of the year compared to the 6.2% move for the Oils-Energy sector and the 17.3% year-to-date return for its peer group.What's Driving the Outperformance?The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises, having beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on May 8, 2018, Occidental Petroleum reported EPS of $0.92 versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.71 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 2.14%.For the current fiscal year, Occidental Petroleum is expected to post earnings of $4.1 per share on $16.56 billion in revenues. This represents a 360.67% change in EPS on a 24.73% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $4.39 per share on $17.85 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 7% and 7.79%, respectively.Valuation MetricsOccidental Petroleum may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for OXY? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.Occidental Petroleum has a Value Score of F. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are A and A, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of B.In terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 20.8X current fiscal year EPS estimates. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 14X versus its peer group's average of 10.2X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 3.21. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.Occidental Petroleum Corporation Price and Consensus  Occidental Petroleum Corporation Price and Consensus | Occidental Petroleum Corporation QuoteZacks RankWe also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Occidental Petroleum currently has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy) thanks to favorable earnings estimate revisions from covering analysts.Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Occidental Petroleum fits the bill. Thus, it seems as though OXY shares could still be poised for more gains ahead.How Does Occidental Petroleum Stack Up to the Competition?Shares of Occidental Petroleum have been soaring, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? Some of its industry peers are also solid potential picks, including Sasol (SSL  -  Free Report), China Petroleum & Chemical (SNP  -  Free Report), and CNOOC (CEO  -  Free Report), all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least #2 and a VGM Score of at least B, making them well-rounded choices.The Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 22% of all the industries we have in our universe, so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for OXY, even beyond its own solid fundamental situation.

324,OXY,"The U.S. stock markets have been reeling from severe volatility since February primarily owing to inflationary concerns and global trade war fears. Additionally, significant hike in U.S. government bond, geopolitical conflicts in the Middle East, political turmoil in Europe and oil price fluctuations also fueled volatility in the Wall Street.Despite the presence of several destabilizing elements in the markets, a closer look of the performance of the three major indexes – the Dow 30, S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite – will give us a positive view.

325,OXY,"Oil prices surged on May 30, following a report by Reuters that Saudi Arabia, other OPEC (Oil and Petroleum Exporting Countries) countries, and non-OPEC allies led by Russia are likely to abide by a global pact on cutting oil supplies until the end of 2018. However, oil producers will make gradual adjustments in the event of any supply disturbances.Notably, oil prices have been plummeting of late following the news that OPEC and Russia are planning to increase crude oil production by 1 million barrels a day to neutralize the effect of shortfall of oil production from Iran and Venezuela.The news of OPEC countries and Russia’s intention to follow the global pact finally brought relief to oil prices which rallied yesterday reversing the price slump in last five days. At this stage, investment in energy stocks engaged in oil production, refining and marketing will be a lucrative option.Oil Prices RecoverOil took a breather from its week-long rout as concerns over higher OPEC production eased. WTI crude rose $1.48 or 2.2%, to settle at $68.21 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. This was WTI’s highest gain in three weeks, after losing almost 8% in five sessions.Brent futures for July settlement rose $2.11 to end the session at $77.50 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The global benchmark crude traded $9.29 higher than the WTI. Likewise, July Brent oil, the international benchmark was up $2.11 or 2.8%, to end at $77.50 a barrel on ICE Futures Europe.Oil Production Likely to Remain Stable in 2018At present, Venezuela and Iran are the major supply disturbances. Economic instability in Venezuela, its massive debt load, unrest in the workforce and hyperinflation will take severe toll on the country’s oil production till the end of 2018.However, problems related to Iran started after the United States withdrew from the nuclear pact and plans to re-impose oil sanctions on it. However, growing support and solidarity among other countries toward the nuclear deal may neutralize the effect of U.S. sanctions as Iran is likely to sell oil to several European and Asian countries.Moreover, several industry experts firmly believe that OPEC will try to compensate the shortage originating due to Venezuela or Iran. However, the largest oil production body will keep the international oil production level intact.Goldman Sachs stated that global oil inventories have already returned to its five-year average. However, demand for oil is very strong and growing. Moreover, shortfall from Venezuela and infrastructure bottlenecks in the Permian is likely to result in low production in the United States. This will add more to supply shortages. In such a situation, even if OPEC decides to increase production it will only just compensate the shortage and not result in a production glut.  Our Top PicksStrong international demand for crude oil, a tight global oil inventories and stabilization of oil production level will boost oil price rally in the near term. Consequently it will be a prudent move to invest in good energy stocks. However, picking winning stocks can be a difficult task.This is where our VGM Score comes in Handy. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores. Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select the winners. However, it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM Score.We have narrowed down our search to the following stocks, each of which has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and a good VGM Score. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Chart below depicts price performance of our five picks in the last three months. BP p.l.c.

326,OXY,"ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report) entered into a Master Service Agreement (MSA) with Ocean Rig UDW Inc. The tenure of the MSA is expected to be three years with scope to get extended by a couple of years.It is to be noted that the oil and gas explorer has inked a Drilling Program Order (DPO) — included in the MSA — with the offshore drilling contractor. Per the DPO, ConocoPhillips will likely be operating a semi-submersible rig of Ocean Rig for drilling an offshore well in Norway, with options for additional two wells. The well is expected to be drilled by Leiv Eiriksson over a period of roughly 90 days.In the Norwegian regions of the North Sea, ConocoPhillips has significant presence. Most importantly, the company is among the largest players in the continental shelf of Norway.Headquartered in Houston, TX, ConocoPhillips is the largest oil and natural gas explorer in the world, in terms of output of commodities and proved reserves. The company has an excellent earnings surprise history. In three of the last four quarters, ConocoPhillips surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate, the average positive earnings surprise being 226.9%.Over the past year, the stock has rallied 46.7%, outperforming the industry’s 8.5% gain. However, we are concerned about ConocoPhillips’ expectation for higher production and operating expenses. For 2018, the firm projects production and operating expenses of $5.7 billion, higher than $5.2 billion for 2017.Currently, the stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), implying that it will perform in line with the broader U.S. equity market over the next one to three months.Meanwhile, a few better-ranked players in the energy sector are BP plc (BP  -  Free Report), Occidental Petroleum Corp. (OXY  -  Free Report) and WildHorse Resource Development Corp. (WRD  -  Free Report). All the stocks sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.

Where should investors look who want a little bit of extra income?Shareholders Finally Get Their PayoutIn 2017, companies spent over $900 billion on dividends and buybacks. This was the sixth year of increases. In 2018, 169 companies have announced dividend increases, with none reporting a decrease. That is the first time that has happened since 2003. Additionally, there have been some huge announcements, including Apple’s (AAPL  -  Free Report) $100 billion share buyback program. Screening for DividendsIt’s not all about what pays out the highest yield. Investors also want companies with solid fundamentals, including rising earnings estimates.Brian screened for that by screening for Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) stocks, both of which should have rising earnings estimates. He also included a dividend yield of 2% or higher, which is above that of the S&P 500 which is currently yielding 1.84%. The screen returned 206 stocks. If you are a premium member, you can replicate this screen on Zacks.com using the screening tool.  Here are five of Tracey and Brian’s favorites.5 Dividend Stocks to Keep on Your Shortlist1.      Las Vegas Sands (LVS  -  Free Report) is cashing in on the global economic boom thanks to its casinos in Macau.

328,OXY,"Business tycoon John D. Rockefeller, with keen interest in the oil industry, once said, “Do you know the only thing that gives me pleasure? It's to see my dividends coming in.”The easiest way to analyze a company’s fundamentals is to consider its dividend payment history as steady and consistent dividends can be paid only after meeting all business obligations.The business scenario for both upstream and midstream energy players is quite favorable as oil is trading well above $65 a barrel and U.S. plays are facing bottleneck in transportation capacity. Hence, it is the ideal time to load up on energy stocks as such companies are likely to maintain impressive dividend payouts.Oil Springs HigherPer the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), the average monthly price of West Texas Intermediate crude has traded well above the $60-a-barrel psychological mark over the first four months of 2018. The commodity traded at an average price of $63.70, $62.23, $62.73 and $66.25 in January, February, March and April, respectively.On May 8, Trump nixed the Iran nuclear deal, putting a lot on the line. Eventually, WTI crude price crossed the $70 mark to scale the highest point since November 2014 in the wake of concerns that Iran’s crude export might fall. Trump also insisted that Iran should refrain from developing nuclear weapons and disengage from the civil war in Syria.  Venezuela also faces the risk of U.S. sanctions. The country, touted to be among the biggest oil producers in Latin America, has been witnessing a steep decline in crude production. Last year, the country reported the lowest oil production in a decade. Hence, sanctions on Venezuela will dent the country’s output further, weighing on the already-tightened global crude supplies.In other words, fears of sanctions on Iran and Venezuela have been largely backing the oil recovery.Room for More DividendsEIA expects WTI crude to average $66 per barrel in 2018, painting a favorable picture for explorers who have raked in profits at prices way below $60 as well.Our proprietary model shows that the trailing 12-month net operating cashflow of the Oil-Energy sector at the end of first-quarter 2018 was $12.3 billion, easily financed the capital spending of $5.8 billion. This has created free cashflow of $6.5 billion, out of which $2.6 billion was paid as dividends.Returning cash back to shareholders is rooted in energy companies’ initiatives to steadily pay out dividends under investor pressure. With more explorers flocking to U.S. shale plays, demand for midstream infrastructure is on the rise. Also, more crude pipelines will likely be constructed in the Permian as the basin has been facing labor shortage and low pipeline capacity.Focus on Dividend Oil StocksGiven the favorable oil price scenario as well as strong demand for transporting and storing fresh crude volumes, the focus should be on upstream and midstream energy players at the moment. Here, we are picking energy stocks that have already been paying out handsome dividends yields.Companies giving impressive dividend yields generally boast strong fundamentals. In other words, it is always better to focus on energy stocks with strong fundamentals as they are more likely to continue paying impressive yields in the days ahead.Picking the Right WaySelecting dividend stocks is not quite a daunting task. Investors should take a close look at the past financial statement and price performance of companies. It could happen that a company which has paid high dividends in the past may struggle to maintain the trend.Here, our proprietary Stock Screener comes in handy. With this tool, we have selected four energy stocks with either a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). These companies have also been paying higher dividend or distribution (in case of partnerships) yields than the S&P 500 index.Headquartered in London, BP plc (BP  -  Free Report) is among the leading integrated energy players in the world. The company has a strong portfolio of upstream projects which has been backing impressive production growth. The British energy giant is committed toward supporting the U.S. economy with extensive presence in the country.The current dividend yield of the firm is 5.4%, significantly higher than S&P 500’s 1.8%. BP sports a Zacks Rank #1.Occidental Petroleum Corporation (OXY  -  Free Report), headquartered in Houston, TX, is one of the leading oil and gas explorers. The company also has a strong presence in midstream energy businesses.It currently has dividend yield of 3.7% and carries a Zacks Rank of 1. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Based in Oklahoma City, Enable Midstream Partners, LP (ENBL  -  Free Report) is a master limited partnership with extensive midstream energy assets.The partnership, with Zacks Rank #2, has a distribution yield of 8.2%.Based in Leawood, KS, Tallgrass Energy GP, LP  primarily provides services related to transportation of crude in the domestic market.This #2 Ranked stock pays out a rewarding distribution of 9.4%.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!

In fact, they’ve outperformed most of the FANG stocks: Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Alphabet and Facebook.What are these unicorns?5 Value Stocks Crushing it in 20181.       Micron (MU  -  Free Report) is one of the hottest stocks of the past 18 months. Yes, it’s been on the podcast about 80% of the time.

331,OXY,"As we know, U.S. President Donald Trump loves to tweet and has quite a loose-cannon approach toward it. After the twitter tussle between the President and Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) early this month, Trump attacked OPEC — The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries— blaming it for artificially hiking oil prices, post which crude prices tumbled; albeit temporarily.  The energy market has witnessed extreme volatility in terms of prices over the past three years. However, the market has finally recovered from the historic lows to comfortably trade at more than $60 a barrel since the start of this year. Crude has been well supported by a variety of catalysts, including strong demand and continued production curbs from OPEC and its allies.Since 2014, major oil producing countries whose economies depend heavily on the resource revenue, have been hugely affected by the oil slump caused by the supply glut. Hence, OPEC members as well as other major non-OPEC countries entered into an agreement in late 2016 to curb oil production in an attempt to rebalance the market. The continued efforts of OPEC have led to the gradual recovery of oil prices.However, it seems that the rally in oil prices on the back of OPEC’s commitment to curtail production has not gone too well with President Trump. OPEC has hiked gasoline prices in the United States and rising energy costs may lead to inflation. Trump took to Twitter on Apr 20 to express his anger, blaming OPEC for artificially inflating oil prices.Trump’s OPEC Tweet Leaves No Lasting ImpactHis tweet read: “Looks like OPEC is at it again. With record amounts of oil all over the place, including the fully loaded ships at sea. Oil prices are artificially Very High! No good and will not be accepted!”This is the first time that Trump lashed out at OPEC on social media during his presidential term. The tweet came as the OPEC and non-OPEC members met in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, to reaffirm their agreement in order to keep output limited. The meeting determined that compliance is at its highest level ever.Following Trump’s tweet, crude prices came under much pressure, dropping to $67.50 a barrel for WTI and $72.83 for Brent. However, by the end of the day it moved higher, rebounding from early losses, to close at $68.38 a barrel (WTI) and $74.07 a barrel (Brent).In fact, the impact of Trump’s tweet fizzled out too soon with both WTI and Brent crude prices pivoting higher yesterday to touch their three-year highs at $ 68.64 a barrel and $ 74.71 a barrel, respectively.Notably, the Energy Select Sector SPDR — an assortment of the largest U.S. energy companies — also rose 0.61% as of Apr 23. The two energy representatives in the 30-stock Dow Jones industrial average, ExxonMobil Corporation (XOM  -  Free Report) and Chevron Corporation (CVX  -  Free Report), added 0.72% and 1%, respectively. Both these supermajors carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Among other big energy companies, Occidental Petroleum Corporation (OXY  -  Free Report) was up 1.01%, Valero Energy Corporation (VLO  -  Free Report) gained 0.65%, while EOG Resources, Inc. (EOG  -  Free Report) saw its stock price go up 0.76%.OPEC Denies, Hits BackSuhail Al Mazrouei — OPEC’s President and UAE’s minister of energy industry — rejected Trumps criticism of OPEC manipulating oil prices claiming that they never targeted any specific price level. He maintained his stance of just focusing on efforts to cut production in order to rebalance the market and prevent it from supply glut.Khalid al-Falih said, “There’s no such thing as artificial price.” He claimed that the OPEC agreements cannot continue to curb the production indefinitely and that it is in fact market demand and supply factors that actually set the price.Alexander Novak, Russia’s energy minister, also supported Falih’s claims asserting that OPEC’s production cut agreement is not just the only factor leading to oil price surge; rather it is the overall market dynamics that determine the price. Further, he also pointed out that crude price recovery has aided the U.S. shale oil industry, with domestic output at record levels.Primary Drivers of Crude RecoveryOne of the main reasons why the U.S. oil benchmark soared revolved around expectations that OPEC and other major producers agreed to expand their output-cut deal beyond March. The coalition prolonged the agreement for another nine months to the end of 2018 in an attempt to clear the supply gut.Meanwhile, reports have emerged that Saudi officials are looking to push oil prices even higher ahead of the launch of the Aramco IPO to bolster its valuation.Another major factor fueling higher oil prices is fast-growing demand for the commodity, which continues to tighten the market. Per the International Energy Agency (IEA), global oil demand is likely to grow by 1.5 million barrels a day this year to average 99.3 million barrels a day.Sharp inventory drawdowns have also helped the commodity tread on a growth trajectory. Oil stockpiles have shrunk in 36 of the last 51 weeks and are down more than 100 million barrels since April last year. The gradual fall – stemming from a combination of lower imports and spiralling exports – has helped the U.S. crude market shift from year-over-year storage surplus to a deficit. At 429.9 million barrels, current crude supplies are 20% below the year-ago period.However, not just these factors but other Middle-East tensions also led to this huge rise in oil prices.Other Factors Behind the UptickFueling the rally in oil prices over the last few weeks are concerns that geopolitical tensions in the Middle East could disrupt crude supplies. Crude prices have been soaring lately on expectations of the reintroduction of sanctions on Iran, expansion of sanctions against Venezuela and strikes on Syria.   Iran Nuclear Deal: Industry watchers are waiting to see if the Trump administration decides to impose sanctions on Iran once again, post the May 12 deadline. Following the lifting of sanctions in 2016 as part of Obama-era agreement, Iran’s crude oil production and exports have been rising. However, the return of sanctions would put pressure on Iran’s energy industry and affect the oil market in general. A disruption to Iranian oil exports and investments in the country might cut off some of its supplies to the global market, thereby boosting prices.The Venezuela Issue: Fast falling production in Venezuela have added to the jitters. With the country tethering on the verge of an economic collapse, oil output has shrunk almost 50% since 2005. As it is, Venezuela currently churns out less than 2 million barrels per day, much lower that its pledge per the OPEC-led supply cuts. U.S. sanctions have further aggravated the situation. Further, Trump is likely to increase sanctions on Venezuela, which will further tighten the markets. A prolonged slump in Venezuela production could result in higher prices.Syria Strike and Russian Involvement Also Pushes Oil Higher: The conflict in Syria heightened after a joint air strike by the United States, France and the United Kingdom, post which crude started marching north. The rally will continue as the United States is likely to take strong measures against Iran and Russia for backing Syria’s chemical attack.Also, the Russian market has seen increased volatility after Moscow was slapped with new American sanctions on Apr 6. Trump will take a strong stand against Russian players, who reportedly helped Syria to carry out the chemical attack. Since, Russia is one of the largest producers and exporters of crude in the world, any sanction on the country will lift crude price.In ConclusionSince April, prices of oil ticked up by almost 8%. However, the latest uptick has got a lot to do with geopolitical tensions and the Trump administration’s policies rather than just the OPEC production curbs. The United States being a powerful global power, plays a significant role in contributing toward these geopolitical tensions. Hence, Trump’s tweet holding OPEC responsible for the surge in prices seems more like a case of the pot calling the kettle black.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

While such performance evaluation normally drawsattention to the bottom line, sales growth demands equal attention. We’ll tell you why.Investors should note that sales are harder to be influenced in an income statement than earnings. A company can land up on decent earnings numbers by adopting cost-cutting or some other measures that do not speak of its core strength. But it is harder for a company to mold its revenue figure.So far, 96.9% of the S&P 500 market cap and 94.8% of the companies have come up with their first-quarter 2018 reports. Total earnings for the first quarter are expected to grow 24.2% from the same period last year on 8.5% higher revenues, per the Earnings Trends issued on May 23, 2018. Around 74.5% of the companies beat on the top line while 77.6% surpassed earnings estimates.Below, we highlight four sectors and their related stocks that could be used to book some profits on double-digit revenue growth potential.MaterialsThe sector is expected to witness the highest revenue growth of 22.4% in the ongoing earnings season. On top of it, about 73.7% companies beat on revenue estimates. The materials sector is best positioned to take advantage of President Trump’s fiscal reflation. Moreover, the President’s “America First” push means more manufacturing in the U.S. territory, which should create greater need for materials.Sierra Metals Inc.

The huge trade deficit of United States with China – recorded at $375 billion per media reports – will eventually come down.UNIPEC, the wholly-owned affiliate of Sinopec, is going to ship 16 million barrels of American oil in June.

The purchase of U.S. oil for the month of June by UNIPEC is estimated at $1.1 billion, Reuters added.China is in a position to import more U.S. oil. However, the hindrance to this move has been the bottleneck for Gulf coast midstream infrastructure. The other problem is that oil produced in the United States is light while China has prioritized heavy crude, the source said.Headquartered in Beijing, Sinopec is the largest refiner of crude in Asia.

339,OXY,"It was a week where oil prices ended above $70-a-barrel and natural gas futures got a lift from the U.S. supply data.On the news front, energy biggies Occidental Petroleum Corp. (OXY  -  Free Report), Cheniere Energy, Inc. (LNG  -  Free Report) and Petrobras (PBR  -  Free Report) came up with strong earnings reports.Overall, it was a good week for the sector. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures gained about 1.4% to close at $70.70 per barrel, while natural gas prices rose some 3.5% to $2.806 per million Btu (MMBtu). (See the last ‘Oil & Gas Stock Roundup’ here: BP & EOG's Q1, Marathon-Andeavor Deal & More)The U.S. oil benchmark hit a new three-and-a-half-year high last week on bullish EIA inventory numbers and a looming drop in Iranian crude exports.The federal government’s EIA report revealed that crude stockpiles recorded a fall of 2.2 million barrels, the first increase in three weeks, and significantly larger than expected. On a further bullish note, the report revealed that refined product inventories, gasoline and distillate, both dropped from their week earlier levels.The commodity was also supported by President Trump’s recent withdrawal from a nuclear deal with OPEC’s third-largest producer Iran and a pledge to reimpose sanctions on Tehran. The action has stoked worries about an expected cut in Iranian oil exports by around 1 million barrels per day from current levels and lead to a supply shortage in an already ‘tight’ oil market.Natural gas prices also moved northward last week following a smaller-than-expected increase in supplies. Stockpiles held in underground storage in the lower 48 states rose by 89 billion cubic feet (Bcf) for the week ended May 4, below the guidance (of 92 Bcf gain) as per the analysts surveyed by S&P Global Platts, a leading independent commodities and energy data provider.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    Houston-based energy explorer Occidental Petroleum reported first-quarter 2018 earnings of 92 cents per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 29.6%. The Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company’s outperformance was owing to improvement in worldwide sales volume and realized price of oil and natural gas liquids. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Occidental Petroleum’s average daily net oil, liquids and gas production volume increased to 609,000 barrels of oil equivalents per day (BOE/d) from 584,000 boe/d reported in the year-ago quarter. This increase could be attributed to increased drilling activity and well productivity in the Permian Resources region. Realized prices for crude oil in the first quarter increased 24.5% year over year to $61.04 per barrel worldwide, while realized NGL prices increased 17.4%.Occidental Petroleum expects second-quarter production to be in the range of 628,000-648,000 BOE/d and Permian Resources production within 188,000-198,000 BOE/d. The company expects 2018 production between 645,000 and 665,000 BOE/d, up from the prior expected range of 640,000-665,000 BOE/d. Occidental expects 2018 Permian Resources production in the range of 198,000-210,000 BOE/d, up from the prior guidance of 195,000-209,000 BOE/d.

The company’s net income per share came in at $1.18, ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 62 cents and the comparable 2017 period profit of 23 cents.During the quarter, the company shipped 67 cargoes from Sabine Pass liquefied natural gas terminal in Louisiana. Total volumes lifted in the reported quarter were 244 trillion British thermal units.Overall costs and expenses soared 79% to $1,495 million from the same quarter last year. The increase is mainly attributed to the higher cost of sales which jumped to $1,178 million compared with $624 million in the prior-year quarter, while operating and maintenance expenses rose 79.5% year-over-year to $140 million.Cheniere Energy raised its EBITDA guidance for full-year 2018, following the better-than-expected profit. The upbeat forecast reflects higher-than-anticipated realized margins on marketing volumes. Adjusted EBITDA is now expected to be between $2,300 million and $2,500 million compared with the prior guidance ranging $2,000-$2,200 million. The distributable cash flow is likely to be between $350 million and $550 million, up from the prior guided range of $200-$400 million.

Earnings per ADR came in at 32 cents (1 ADR equivalent to 2 shares in the Brazilian market), well ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 19 cents. Higher oil prices were primarily responsible for the outperformance, which helped Petrobras post its best quarterly earnings in five years.Importantly, Petrobras generated free cash flows of $4,005 million for the quarter ended Mar 31 – positive for the twelfth quarter in a row – reflecting operational improvement and lower investments. However, free cash flows fell 3% from the year-ago period due to the payment associated with a class action lawsuit. Moreover, adjusted EBITDA edged down 1% to $7,914 million.During the three months ended Mar 31, 2018, Petrobras’ capital investments and expenditures totaled $3,067 million, lower than the $3,672 million incurred in the year-ago period.This allowed the world's most indebted oil company to trim its massive debt load. At the end of the quarter, the company had net debt of $81,447 million, decreasing from the $84,871 million as of Dec 31, 2017. Net debt-to-capitalization ratio during the same period was approximately 49%, down from 51% three months ago. Additionally, Petrobras finished the first quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $19,966 million.

(For more details read our weekly Zacks Earnings Trends)The VerdictBoth Occidental Petroleum and ConocoPhillips surpassed first-quarter earnings expectations but the former has a better earnings surprise trend in the last four quarters.The companies saw upward estimates for 2018 and 2019 in the last 30 days. However, the magnitude of estimate revisions for Occidental Petroleum was better than ConocoPhillips.Given its better rank and magnitude of estimate revisions post earnings, our verdict is tilted toward Occidental Petroleum.  Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

345,OXY,"Eni SpA (E  -  Free Report) signed two Concession agreements with Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (“ADNOC”). The move is expected to strengthen the company’s footprint in the region, which is known to hold the largest hydrocarbon reserve in the world.The agreements include two offshore oil blocks in the Persian Gulf and marks Eni’s first expedition into oil development in the United Arab Emirates.For a total participation fee of about $875 million, the company acquired a 5% stake in the Lower Zakum offshore oil field and o a 10% stake in the oil, condensate and gas offshore fields of Umm Shaif and Nasr. The contract is for a period of 40 years.Located about 65 kilometers off the coast of Abu Dhabi, Lower Zakum, was discovered in 1963 and was brought online in 1967. Production from the license is targeted at 450,000 barrels of oil per day. Located about 135 kilometers from the coast of Abu Dhabi, Umm Shaif and Nasr have a target production of 460,000 barrels of oil per day.ADNOC — the operator of the licenses — has a stake of 60% each, while Eni holds the remaining 40%.

347,OXY,"ExxonMobil Corporation (XOM  -  Free Report) and Synthetic Genomics Inc. have initiated a new phase in their joint algae biofuel research program. Through the study, the company intends 10,000 barrels of algae biofuel per day by 2025.ExxonMobil’s assumption is based on the research carried out till date and emerging technical capability. To progress toward large-scale production, extra work is required. As the study advances, the companies continue to perform basic research on algae biology in their laboratories.The scope of the new phase comprises an outdoor field study that will raise naturally occurring algae in numerous contained ponds in California. Better understanding of the fundamental engineering parameters including viscosity and flow will be facilitated from the research. These parameters are difficult to imitate in a lab. The potential commercial deployment of this technology largely depends on the outcome of this research.Subsequent to the companies’ years of fundamental biological research into accepting and enhancing algae oil production, outdoor research will follow.ExxonMobil and Synthetic Genomics have been researching jointly since 2009 to develop oil from algae that could be substituted as a renewable, lower-emission fuel to traditional transportation ones.ExxonMobil also partnered with universities, government laboratories and other companies to perform a wide range of research on advanced biofuels.In 2017, ExxonMobil and Synthetic Genomics got a breakthrough research published in Nature Biotechnology that lead to a modified algae strain which more than doubled oil content without considerably restraining growth, a key challenge along the path to commercial scalability.Transportation-related global energy demand is estimated to grow about 25% through 2040. Thereby, a cut in emissions from the transportation sector will play a significant role in reducing global greenhouse gas release.Additionally, other researches by ExxonMobil include emission-reducing technologies, including carbon capture and sequestration. The company has invested about $8 billion since 2000 to build and deploy lower-emission energy solutions in its operations.Price PerformanceDuring the last three months, ExxonMobil’s shares have lost 7.7% compared with the industry’s 1.1% decline. Zacks Rank & Key PicksExxonMobil carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked players in the same sector are Occidental Petroleum Corp.

351,OXY,"Have you been paying attention to shares of Occidental Petroleum OXY)? Shares have been on the move with the stock up 18.4% over the past month. OXY hit a new 52-week high of $85.79 in the previous session. Occidental Petroleum has gained 15.4% since the start of the year compared to the 9.5% move for the Oils-Energy sector and the 19.1% year-to-date return for its peer group.What's Driving the Outperformance?The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises, having beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on May 8, 2018, Occidental Petroleum reported EPS of $0.92 versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.71 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 2.14%.For the current fiscal year, Occidental Petroleum is expected to post earnings of $3.49 per share on $16 billion in revenues. This represents a 325.84% change in EPS on a 20.52% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $3.49 per share on $16.55 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 6.52% and 3.45%, respectively.Valuation MetricsOccidental Petroleum may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for OXY? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM score as well. The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.Occidental Petroleum has a Value Score of F. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are A and A, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of B.In terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 24.4X current fiscal year EPS estimates. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 13.9X versus its peer group's average of 10.3X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 3.75. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.Occidental Petroleum Corporation Price and Consensus Occidental Petroleum Corporation Price and Consensus | Occidental Petroleum Corporation QuoteZacks RankWe also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Occidental Petroleum currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Occidental Petroleum fits the bill. Thus, it seems as though OXY shares could have a bit more room to run in the near term.How Does Occidental Petroleum Stack Up to the Competition?Shares of Occidental Petroleum have been rising, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? Some of its industry peers are also solid potential picks, including Cactus (WHD  -  Free Report), BP p.l.c. (BP  -  Free Report), and CNOOC (CEO  -  Free Report), all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least #2 and a VGM Score of at least B, making them well-rounded choices.The Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 35% of all the industries we have in our universe, so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for OXY, even beyond its own solid fundamental situation.

352,OXY,"Markets closed higher on Wednesday, driven by a rally in energy stocks, as oil prices soared. The rise in oil prices followed President Donald Trump’s decision to pull out of the Iran nuclear deal a day earlier. Moreover, the broader market also got a boost from financial stocks. This saw all three major indexes ending the day in positive territory.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 0.8%, to close at 24,542.54, registering its fifth straight day of gains. The S&P 500 increased 1% to close at 2,697.79. The Nasdaq Composite Index closed at 7,349.91, increasing 1%. The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) closed down 1.29 points at 13.42, its lowest since Jan 26, 2018. A total of 7.1 billion shares were traded on Wednesday, higher than the last 20-session average of 6.6 billion shares. Advancers outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by a 1.71-to-1 ratio. On Nasdaq, a 1.65-to-1 ratio favored advancing issues.How did the Benchmark Perform?The Dow gained 182.33 driven by a rally in tech stocks. Of the 30 blue-chip companies 23 registered gains. DowDuPont Inc. (DWDP  -  Free Report) was the best performer on the index, gaining 2.8%. However, Walmart Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report) was one of the biggest losers, declining 3.1%.

Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq gained 73.00 points.Oil Prices Rise Bossing Energy StocksOil prices hit a three and-half-year high on Wednesday following Trump’s decision to abandon the 2015 Iran nuclear deal a day earlier. WTI Crude Oil increased 2.9% to $71.14 a barrel, while Brent Crude Oil rose 3.1% to $77.21 per barrel.On Tuesday, Trump had said that the United States would re-impose sanctions on Iran. This gave rise to speculation of increasing level of conflict in the Middle East, which could result in curtailing global oil supplies. This saw oil prices shooting up resulting in a rally in energy stocks.Occidental Petroleum Corporation (OXY  -  Free Report) was the best performer in the S&P 500, with its shares increasing 5.4%. Marathon Oil Corporation (MRO  -  Free Report) gained 4%.Financial Stocks GainThis rise in oil prices increased inflationary pressure. This in turn lead to possibility of further rate hikes by the Fed, eventually boosting financial shares.As inflationary pressure is expected to build up with the rise in oil price, bonds are becoming less appealing resulting in its yield to go up. This rise in yield again helped financial stocks move north. The 10-year Treasury yield once again crossed the psychological 3% mark.Stocks That Made HeadlinesGOL Linhas (GOL  -  Free Report) Q1 Earnings In Line, Revenues Miss EstimatesGOL Linhas Aereas Inteligentes S.A.’s (GOL  -  Free Report) first-quarter 2018 earnings were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. (Read More)Enbridge to Sell Midstream Businesses in Texas and OklahomaEnbridge Inc.’s (ENB  -  Free Report) indirect subsidiary — Enbridge (U.S.) Inc — has inked a definitive agreement with AL Midcoast Holdings, LLC (AL Midcoast), an affiliate of ArcLight Capital Partners, LLC, for sale of Midcoast Operating, L.P. and its subsidiaries (Midcoast). (Read More)Wall Street’s Next Amazon Zacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

353,OXY,"The U.S. Energy Department's weekly inventory release showed that crude stockpiles recorded a fall of 2.2 million barrels, the first increase in three weeks, and significantly larger than expected. On a further bullish note, the report revealed that refined product inventories, gasoline and distillate, both dropped from their week earlier levels. Importantly, the positive data sets have added to the strong sentiment in the oil market.As a result, the front month West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures gained 3% (or $2.08) to $71.14 per barrel yesterday – the highest settlement since November 2014.Over the past month, the commodity has been supported by speculation that the United States could renew sanctions on OPEC-member Iran. True to predictions, U.S. President Donald Trump recently withdrew from a nuclear deal with the cartel’s third-largest producer and pledged to reimpose sanctions on Tehran. The action has stoked worries about an expected cut in Iranian oil exports by around 1 million barrels per day from current levels and lead to a supply shortage in an already ‘tight’ oil market.Energy Stocks on a RollThe bullish oil market sentiment encouraged buying in energy stocks, which lifted the Energy Select Sector SPDR – an assortment of the largest U.S. energy companies – more than 2% Wednesday.The two energy representatives in the 30-stock Dow Jones industrial average, Exxon Mobil (XOM  -  Free Report) and Chevron (CVX  -  Free Report) added 2.4% and 1.7%, respectively. Meanwhile, some of the biggest gainers of the S&P 500 were oil and oil-related stocks like Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO  -  Free Report), Occidental Petroleum Corporation (OXY  -  Free Report), Marathon Oil Corporation (MRO  -  Free Report) and National Oilwell Varco, Inc. (NOV  -  Free Report).Analysis of the EIA DataCrude Oil: The federal government’s EIA report revealed that crude inventories fell by 2.2 million barrels for the week ending May 4, following an increase of 6.2 million barrels in the previous week. The analysts surveyed by S&P Global Platts – the leading independent commodities and energy data provider – had expected crude stocks to go down some 400,000 barrels.A sharp drop in net crude imports to its lowest since March led to the larger-than-expected draw with the world's biggest oil consumer even as domestic production reached a new record.In particular, U.S. output rose by 84,000 barrels per day last week to more than 10.7 million barrels per day – the most since the EIA started maintaining weekly data in 1983. In early February, oil production broke through the 10 million barrels a day threshold for the first time in nearly 50 years and has maintained the record levels thereafter.Meanwhile, stockpiles have shrunk in 39 of the last 57 weeks and are down nearly 90 million barrels in the past year. The gradual fall has helped the U.S. crude market shift from year-over-year storage surplus to a deficit. At 433.8 million barrels, current crude supplies are 17% below the year-ago period and are in the bottom half of the average range during this time of the year.However, stocks at the Cushing terminal in Oklahoma – the key delivery hub for U.S. crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange – was up by 1.4 million barrels to 37.2 million barrels.At 26.0 days, the crude supply cover was unchanged from the previous week. In the year-ago period, the supply cover was 30.7 days.Gasoline: Gasoline supplies recorded their first decrease in three weeks as imports and production dropped, while demand strengthened. The 2.2 million barrels decline – outpacing the polled number of 600,000 barrels fall in supply level – took gasoline stockpiles down to 235.8 million barrels. Following last week’s draw, the stock of the most widely used petroleum product is now 2.2% below the year-earlier level and it is in the bottom half of the average range.Distillate: Distillate fuel supplies (including diesel and heating oil) were down 3.8 million barrels last week, twice analysts’ expectations for 1.9 million barrels decrease in supply level. The weekly fall could be attributed to slightly lower production. At 115 million barrels, current supplies are 23% below the year-ago level and are in the lower half of the average range for this time of the year.Refinery Rates: Refinery utilization was down by 0.7% from the prior week to 90.4%.About the Weekly Petroleum Status ReportThe Energy Information Administration (EIA) Petroleum Status Report, containing data of the previous week ending Friday, outlines information regarding the weekly change in petroleum inventories held and produced by the U.S., both locally and abroad.The report provides an overview of the level of reserves and their movements, thereby helping investors understand the demand/supply dynamics of petroleum products. It is an indicator of current oil prices and volatility that affect the businesses of the companies engaged in the oil and refining industry.Want to Own an Energy Stock Now?If you are looking for a near-term energy play, Wildhorse Resource Development Corporation (WRD  -  Free Report) may be an excellent selection.

354,OXY,"In a bid to deepen its focus on U.S. shale plays, Marathon Oil (MRO  -  Free Report) recently offloaded its oil acreage in Libya to France-based supermajor TOTAL S.A. (TOT  -  Free Report). This development marks the exit of Marathon Oil from Libya.Deal HighlightsPer the deal, Marathon Oil divested 16.3% interest in the Waha acreage in Libya. Other partners in Waha concessions include Libya’s national oil company with 60% stake, along with ConocoPhillips and Hess Corp. with 16.3% and 8.2% stake, respectively. At the end of 2017, Marathon Oil held 199 million barrels of oil equivalent (boe) of proved reserves in Libya.The divestment deal was valued at $450 million.Marathon Oil on a Divestment SpreeIn the last couple of years, the Texas-based energy explorer has inked several deals to sell non-core assets that do not fit into the company’s long-term growth plan. In August 2015, the company divested its Wilburton, OK assets for an amount of $102 million. In November 2015, Marathon Oil jettisoned Gulf of Mexico (GoM) assets for a total price of $205 million.In April 2016, the company inked a deal to divest its Wyoming upstream and midstream assets to Merit Energy for $950 million. Further, in October 2016, the upstream player signed a deal to sell some of its non-core assets in West Texas and New Mexico for $235 million. Additionally, in March 2017, the company exited the high-cost Canadian oil-sands operations for $2.5 billion.In fact, over the last two years, the company has garnered proceeds of over $4 billion from its divestment deals. Notably, Marathon Oil has made an exit from seven countries since 2013.Deal RationaleThe recent divestment of Libyan holdings is just another move by Marathon Petroleum to further streamline its portfolio. Over the last two years, the company has successfully positioned itself into the Delaware Basin and low cost-high margin STACK/SCOOP resource plays while exiting non-core property assets with limited upside.In fact, driven by the key low cost-high margin U.S. resource shales including Permian, Eagle Ford and Bakken, Marathon Oil has projected an increase of 18% in its total production for 2018. The company announced a 2018 capital program of $2,300 million, with around 95% of the outlay earmarked for high return U.S. resource plays.Also, the deal is in sync with the company’s focus to boost its financials. In the recent earnings release, the company restated its commitment toward strengthening its balance sheet and driving cash flows. With $450 million coming in from the latest divestment, along with the remaining proceeds from the sale of Canadian oil-sands business, Marathon Oil is set for a robust cash influx in the coming quarter. This will also position the company to tap on strategic growth opportunities through bolt-on acquisitions.  Moreover, Marathon Oil has been bearing the brunt of stuttering operations in Libya amid political instability and conflicts in the region. Production from the region once accounted for over 11% of the company’s total oil and gas output. However, amid the political and security scenario, the company’s operations in the region had become uncertain and consequently the output was declining. As such, Marathon Oil generated little cash flow from the region in comparison with the rest of its portfolio.Nevertheless, TOTAL — having operated in Libya for nearly 65 years — looks better positioned to handle the political uncertainty of the region. Despite the risks, TOTAL believes that the acquisition will provide growth opportunities and bolster its historic strengths in the Middle East and North African regions. The acquisition signifies TOTAL’s vote of confidence in the country that is making efforts to ramp-up production amid political turmoil.Zacks Rank & Key PicksMarathon Oil carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Shares of Marathon Oil have increased almost 27% over the last six months, outperforming the broader industry’s gain of 12%.We believe that the company's high emphasis on exiting non-core business, and focusing on strategic acquisitions and balance sheet strengthening will drive growth. However, management’s low priority toward dividend growth and share buyback programs may dampen investor's confidence.A few better-ranked players within the same industry include ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report) and Occidental Petroleum Corp. (OXY  -  Free Report), each sporting a Zacks Rank #1(Strong Buy).

355,OXY,"Marathon Oil Corporation (MRO  -  Free Report) – a leading upstream energy firm based in Houston, TX – posted fourth-quarter adjusted income of 7 cents per share, ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 2 cents. In the year-earlier quarter, the company incurred adjusted loss of 10 cents.The strong numbers came thanks to higher production and the recovery in crude prices. In particular, total quarterly output rose 12% year over year to 383,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day (BOE/d).Quarterly revenues of $1,382 million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,280 million and also rose from the prior-year quarter level of $1,124 million.Marathon Oil Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Marathon Oil Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Marathon Oil Corporation QuoteSegmental PerformanceUnited States E&P: Marathon Oil’s United States upstream segment reported a profit of $76 million, turning around from the loss of $91 million a year ago. Higher oil prices and production improved the results.Marathon Oil reported production available for sale of 262,000 BOE/d, up from 212,000 BOE/d in the fourth quarter of 2016.

But natural gas realizations decreased 7.7% year over year to $2.65 per thousand cubic feet (Mcf). International E&P: The segment’s income increased 7.3% year over year to $118 million.

The decrease in output could be blamed on the temporary shut-down of the third party-operated Forties Pipeline System, natural field declines and planned turnaround activity in the U.K.The company realized liquids price of $51.13 per barrel, reflecting a 35.1% rise from the year-earlier quarter level of $37.85 per barrel.

357,OXY,"Patterson-UTI Energy Inc. (PTEN  -  Free Report) shares plunged 14.3% Thursday after the onshore contract driller reported adjusted net loss per share of 10 cents, 2 cents wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate on soaring expenses.The company is already grappling with the aftermath of the recent explosion in a well in Quinton, OK, owned by Red Mountain Energy. The tragedy, one of the deadliest oil and gas related accidents in the last few years, occurred at one of Patterson-UTI's APEX 1500 rigs and killed five workers.However, Patterson-UTI’s performance improved from the year-ago loss of 53 cents per share as shale drilling picked up amid rebounding oil prices.Revenues of $787.3 million compared with $246.9 million in the year-ago quarter and were also higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $760 million.Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. QuoteSegmental PerformanceContract Drilling: This segment’s revenues totaled $309.6 million, soaring 127.5% year over year.Average revenues per operating day decreased to $20,950 from $21,640 in the fourth quarter of 2016. However, average direct costs per operating day came in at $12,940, down from $13,770 in the year-ago quarter. The segment was also boosted by a jump in both the operating days (from 6,288 to 14,776) and the number of rigs operational (from 68 to 161) on the back of resilience in Patterson-UTI’s operations amid an improving market.Consequently, the segment recorded operating loss of $16.4 million – significantly narrower than the loss of $62.5 million incurred in the year-earlier quarter.Pressure Pumping: Revenues of $406.7 million almost trebled from the year-ago sales of $105.6 million. Moreover, the segment reported a profit of $22.4 million, turning around from a loss of $40.1 million in the prior-year quarter. Pricing gains and higher activity led to the improvement.Directional Drilling: Directional Drilling – Patterson-UTI’s newest unit following the acquisition of MS Directional – lost $21,000 on revenues of $45.6 million.Other Operations: Revenues came in at $25.5 million compared to $5.2 million in the year-ago quarter. However, the rebound in commodity prices notwithstanding, the unit incurred a wider quarterly loss of $7.8 million, as against the loss of $1.1 million recorded in year-ago quarter. The deterioration was mainly on account of steep rise in direct operating costs – from $2.8 million to $20.9 million.Direct Operating CostsThe company – whose larger rival Helmerich & Payne Inc. (HP  -  Free Report) also reported a loss but managed to outperform estimates – incurred direct operating expenses of $567.9 million, reflecting a 200% jump from $189.4 million reported in the year-ago quarter.Capital Expenditure & Balance SheetDuring the quarter, Patterson-UTI spent approximately $237.2 million on capital programs (as against $39.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2016). Capital expenditure for the full-year 2017 came in at $567.1 million.As of Dec 31, 2017, the company had $42.8 million in cash and $598.8 million in long-term debt.Guidance & OutlookPatterson-UTI management remains upbeat over its business following the recovery in land rig count and the recent bullishness in activity and pricing. In fact, the company sees 2018 as an exciting year for super-spec rigs. The company has 130 of them in its fleet with 98% under contract.While Patterson-UTI sees an average rig count of 169 in the first quarter, it also expects average rig revenue per day to increase $300 sequentially, driven by favorable repricing of short-term contracts.

360,OXY,"President Trump wants to slap tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum to protect domestic producers. But it hasn’t gone down well with the investing community. The tariffs will increase the cost of companies that rely heavily on steel and aluminum, affecting their bottom lines. Further, these have raised anxieties that other countries will retaliate, increasing the odds of a trade war and harm to the global economy.  The tariff declaration incited a steep stock market selloff and a rebuke from world leaders. The Dow plunged for four straight trading sessions on Mar 2, while the industrials sector of the S&P 500 was hit the hardest. The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX), Wall Street’s so-called fear gauge came in at 19.59, way higher than a reading near 11 for most of 2017.With the markets receiving a drubbing on Trump tariffs, investing in stocks that provide excellent risk-adjusted returns won’t be a bad proposition.Trump Tariffs to Hurt U.S. IndustrialsTrump surprised the global market by announcing steep tariffs on imported steel and aluminum. The President said that the United States will impose a 25% tariff on steel imports and a 10% tariff on aluminum.But, tariffs on steel and aluminum have stoked concerns among manufacturers of cars, planes and machinery that rely heavily on such products. After all, steel and aluminum are major expenses for these industries, so an uptick in cost will hurt their profits. Needless to say, the tariff announcement has propelled steel prices to a six-year high of $840 per ton, while aluminum prices exploded to a two-year high at 17 cents per pound.Higher prices on steel and aluminum, furthermore, will compel these companies that rely on such products to pass on some of the costs to consumers. Increased consumer prices may in the long run hamper sales growth and affect companies, leading to job losses. Trump’s tariffs are estimated to hurt nearly 6.5 million U.S. workers at steel and aluminum consuming manufacturers.Retaliation Heats UpThe affected companies further cautioned that they may face retaliatory tariffs from foreign players against the goods they export, eventually denting their profit margins. Trump’s tariff announcement has already evoked anger among global leaders, with the European Union saying that it will impose tariffs on $3.5 billion worth of U.S. imports, as per Reuters.China cautioned America to abide by multilateral trade rules and not to harm the delicate global economy. We shouldn’t forget that China is the world’s dominant steel producer and Trump’s tariff moves could easily start a trade war between them.Tariffs also raise threats of a trade war with America’s closest ally, Canada. After all, Canada is the top exporter of both steel and aluminum from the United States. Canada is solely responsible for manufacturing 17% of all the U.S. steel imports and 43% of all aluminum imports. Other major suppliers to the United States, including Brazil, South Korea, Mexico and Russia will also be negatively impacted.Tariffs news hit not only heavy users of steel and aluminum, but also cyclical-sensitive sectors like technology and consumer cyclicals to name a few. Investors remained worried that threats of retaliation by trade partners could harm global economic growth that was widely seen as the major driving force of the stock market’s rally last year.Dow Companies Strongly Disagree With Trump TariffsHere is how some of the blue-chip companies responded to Trump tariffs:The Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report) agreed with Can Manufacturers Institute (CMI) President Robert Budway, who said that tariff restrictions will have a severe impact on the can manufacturing industry, its employees and consumers of such aluminum cans. Tariffs will increase price, lead to supply inefficiency and affect product availability.Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM  -  Free Report) supported American Petroleum Institute (API) stance that they “support free trade” largely in the oil and natural gas industries, but in other industries as well.JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report) shares its view with Joshua Bolten, chief executive of the Business Roundtable, who said that the industry group urges Trump to persuade “other approaches” to address issues related to overcapacity of steel and aluminum that won’t place the economy at high risk.Walmart Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report) stood by Retail Industry Leaders Association that said “Trump administration’s intention to unilaterally impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports could have severely negative consequences for the American economy. If broadly applied, these tariffs will have a downstream impact on every sector.”The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (GS  -  Free Report) responded by saying that Trump’s tariff plan “is likely to escalate trade tensions, particularly as it looks likely to apply to a broad group of countries including to some allies of the U.S.”5 Ultra-Safe BetsGiven such heightened tariff concerns, investors should build a strategy around low-risk assets and a combination of parameters that lead to better returns. The best way to go about doing this is by creating a portfolio of low-beta stocks that are inherently less volatile than the markets they trade in.

361,OXY,"The U.S. Energy Department's inventory release showed that crude stockpiles recorded a second straight weekly build. On a further bearish note, gasoline and distillate inventories rose, too.However, the talking point from the data sets was the steady trend of rising domestic oil production that continues to be the biggest headwind for the market. EIA revealed that weekly U.S. crude output jumped above 10 million barrels a day for the first time since 1970. This has refueled concerns that the domestic supply glut is cancelling out cuts from OPEC and its allies.As a result, the front month West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures moved down 2.5% (or $1.6) to end at $61.79 per barrel yesterday – the lowest settlement since Jan 8.Investors Dump Energy StocksThe federal data sparked widespread selling in energy stocks, which pushed the Energy Select Sector SPDR – an assortment of the largest U.S. energy companies – down almost 1.7% Wednesday.The two energy representatives in the 30-stock Dow Jones industrial average, ExxonMobil Corp. (XOM  -  Free Report) and Chevron Corp. (CVX  -  Free Report) lost 1.8% and 1.6%, respectively, yesterday. Meanwhile, some of the biggest casualties of the S&P 500 were oil and oil-related stocks like Southwestern Energy Co. (SWN  -  Free Report), Chesapeake Energy Corp. (CHK  -  Free Report), Marathon Oil Corp. (MRO  -  Free Report) and Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO  -  Free Report).Analysis of the EIA DataCrude Oil: The federal government’s EIA report revealed that crude inventories rose by 1.9 million barrels for the week ending Feb 2, following an increase of 6.8 million barrels in the previous week. The analysts surveyed by S&P Global Platts – the leading independent commodities and energy data provider – had expected crude stocks to go up some 2.8 million barrels.Record high domestic production led to the stockpile build with the world's biggest oil consumer. This was partly offset by lower imports and higher refiner demand, which helped restrict the inventory injection below expectations.In particular, U.S. output rose by 332,000 barrels per day last week to more than 10.2 million barrels per day – the most since the EIA started maintaining weekly data in 1983 and the first time in nearly 50 years that oil production broke through the 10 million barrels a day threshold.While oil inventories rose for a second successive week, stockpiles have shrunk in 34 of the last 44 weeks and are down more than 110 million barrels since April. The gradual fall has helped the U.S. crude market shift from year-over-year storage surplus to a deficit. At 420.3 million barrels, current crude supplies are 17.4% below the year-ago period though they are in the middle of the average range during this time of the year.Meanwhile, stocks at the Cushing terminal in Oklahoma – the key delivery hub for U.S. crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange – was down by 711,000 barrels to three-year lows of 36.3 million barrels.The crude supply cover was up from 25.1 days in the previous week to 25.4 days. In the year-ago period, the supply cover was 31.6 days.Gasoline: Gasoline supplies recorded their twelfth increase in 13 weeks on the strength of production and imports. The 3.4 million barrels addition – significantly above the polled number of 200,000 barrels rise in supply level – took gasoline stockpiles up to 245.5 million barrels. Despite last week’s increase, the stock of the most widely used petroleum product remains 4.2% below the year-earlier level and is in the middle of the average range.Distillate: Distillate fuel supplies (including diesel and heating oil) gained 3.9 million barrels last week, contrary to analysts’ expectations for 800,000 barrels decrease in supply level. The weekly rise could be attributed to tepid demand and strong production. But at 141.8 million barrels, current supplies are still 16.9% below the year-ago level and are in the middle of the average range for this time of the year.Refinery Rates: Refinery utilization was up by 4.4% from the prior week to 92.5%.About the Weekly Petroleum Status ReportThe Energy Information Administration (EIA) Petroleum Status Report, containing data of the previous week ending Friday, outlines information regarding the weekly change in petroleum inventories held and produced by the U.S., both locally and abroad.The report provides an overview of the level of reserves and their movements, thereby helping investors understand the demand/supply dynamics of petroleum products. It is an indicator of current oil prices and volatility that affect the businesses of the companies engaged in the oil and refining industry.The data from EIA generally acts as a catalyst for crude prices and affect producers, such as ExxonMobil Corp. (XOM  -  Free Report), Chevron Corp. (CVX  -  Free Report) and ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report), and refiners such as Valero Energy Corp. (VLO  -  Free Report), Phillips 66 (PSX) and Marathon Petroleum Corp. (MPC  -  Free Report).Want to Own an Energy Stock Now?If you are looking for a near-term energy play, Occidental Petroleum Corporation (OXY  -  Free Report) may be a good selection.

362,OXY,"The United States has pulled out of the landmark deal curbing Iran’s nuclear program and reimposing sanctions on the Islamic Republic. Trump said that it was a “horrible one-sided deal that should have never, ever been made.” He added that the “Iran deal is defective at its core” and it’s an “embarrassment” that the United States did little to restrain Iran’s nuclear ambition.In the run-up to the U.S. decision, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu claimed that he has evidence that the nuclear deal was nothing but fabrications and Iran was hiding nuclear weapons. Trump agreed that Netanyahu’s claims corroborated his own view.So, what is the Iran nuclear deal? It was a historic agreement reached by Iran and several other world powers including Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and the United States to reduce the Islamic Republic’s ability to produce two major components of nuclear weapons — plutonium and uranium. In return, Iran will be able spared of crippling financial sanctions. The deal also permitted Iran to export more crude provided the nation restricted its nuclear activities.Let us now take a look at the potential winners and losers emerging from the end of the Iran nuclear deal:Oil Near $70, Energy Stocks GainWith the United States poised to reimpose sanctions on Iran’s petroleum sales, oil prices initially dropped but rebounded soon after. This has disrupted global oil production at a time when the crude market is tight. The international benchmark, Brent crude oil, rose as high as 3.1% to $77.20 in early trading in London on May 9, while the benchmark price for U.S. crude oil climbed to $70.93. Shares of energy companies are, undoubtedly, rallying as crude prices hover near $70 a barrel. Energy shares are looking up after they fell out of favor when oil price slipped from $100 a barrel to under $30 in 2014. In fact, the energy sector of the S&P 500 has risen more than 10% in the past month to total gains of 3.1% so far this year.From exploration and production firm Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (APC  -  Free Report) and Hess Corporation (HES  -  Free Report) to petroleum refiner Valero Energy Corporation (VLO  -  Free Report), all have seen a rally in shares of more than 20% to date, easily outperforming the broader S&P 500’s decline of less than 0.1%. Meanwhile, smaller energy equipment and services companies, whose shares tend to rise with an uptick in oil prices, have gained even more.At the same time, companies like Encana Corporation, Occidental Petroleum Corporation (OXY  -  Free Report) and Pioneer Natural Resources Company’s (PXD  -  Free Report) earnings are poised to improve further as oil prices scale north. This is because these companies have already posted better results in the most recent quarter when oil prices were between $50 and $60 a barrel.As oil continues to hover around $70 a barrel and is probably heading toward $80 soon, these energy players will not only make the most of the higher spot prices but will also hedge into next year at higher oil prices.But let’s admit that it’s just not oil prices that are changing investors’ attitude toward energy companies. Stronger balance sheets, steady rise in profitability and focus to boost shareholders’ returns are shaping the turnaround in the energy space.Oil majors Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM  -  Free Report) and Chevron Corporation (CVX  -  Free Report) have already seen the best first-quarter performance in years last month. In all, the highest first quarter year-over-year earnings growth is likely to be recorded in the energy sector, which is expected to surge 73.9% from the same period last year on 14.4% higher revenues.Given this bullishness, some of the top-ranked energy shares one could consider are Evolution Petroleum Corporation (EPM  -  Free Report), Pioneer Energy Services Corp. (PES  -  Free Report), Oasis Midstream Partners LP (OMP  -  Free Report) and Rice Midstream Partners LP (RMP  -  Free Report). These stocks flaunt a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and a VGM Score of A or B. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three metrics. Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners (read more: Oil Hits $70 for First Time in 4 Years: 5 Top Energy Picks).Travel Shares Go Down, Boeing in TroubleThe surge in oil prices incited investors to dump travel and leisure stocks, put off by the prospect of increasing fuel costs for airlines. Travel and leisure stocks dropped as much as 2.1% on May 8.Trump’s announcement to withdraw from what he considers a “defective” Iranian nuclear deal, in the meantime, is expected to heighten tensions in the Middle East region. This doesn’t bode well for The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report). The airline manufacturer stands to lose a whopping $20 billion in business with Iran. After all, it has an agreement to sell around 110 planes worth the said amount to Iranian airlines.The U.S. withdrawal also affected Boeing’s French rival Airbus SE, which had a multibillion-dollar sale planned. IranAir has ordered nearly 80 passenger aircraft from Airbus.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of All                 Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

363,OXY,"SandRidge Energy, Inc.  has recently been offered a merger deal from rival Midstates Petroleum Company  in an all-stock deal. The move, if it were to be agreed upon at somew poibnt in the future, would create one of the largest oil players in the Mississippian Lime shale formation. Both Tulsa-based Midstates Petroleum and Oklahoma-based SandRidge have prominent presence in Mississippian Lime and the merger would be likely to unlock substantial synergies for both companies.Following the news of the offer, SandRidge shares rose more than 2.2% to eventually close at $16.87 on Feb 6. On the other hand, Midstates Petroleum stock dipped around 1% to eventually close at $15.30 following the announcement.This comes almost after a month SandRidge cancelled its plan to acquire Colorado-based Bonanza Creek Energy (BCEI  -  Free Report) amid shareholders’ strong opposition.Details of the DealSandRidge shareholders would be expected to receive 1.068 shares of Midstates Petroleum’s for each share held, according to the proposed deal, per its closing price as on Feb 5. SandRidge shareholders would own a 60% stake in the combined company, with the remaining interest held by Midstates Petroleum. The combined entity would likely be valued at nearly $1 billion.According to the proposal, Midstates’ CEO David J. Sambrooks would serve as the chief controller of new entity. The proposal also supports the prolonged efforts of Fir Tree Partners and Carl Icahn — two of the biggest shareholders in both SandRidge and Midstates Petroleum — who have long criticized SandRidge’s managerial decisions and wanted a change in the company’s leadership position.The new entity would own more than 450,000 net acres in the core of the Mississippian Lime play, with the production capacity of over 53,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. In addition, the combined company would also hold 75,000 net acres in the Northwest STACK play.Benefits of the DealThe merger would benefit from complementary assets which would likely lead to various financial, commercial and operational synergies. It would lead to cost synergies of around $70 million annually, generating free cash flow of over $100 million. The deal would lead to significant value addition for both companies.  Both companies have emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy after successfully completing debt restructuring. SandRidge recovered from bankruptcy in October 2016 after reorganizing $4.1 billion in debt, while MIdstates Petroleum came out of the same in December 2016 after writing off $2 billion in debt.The proposed combined company would not have any debt and would display strong liquidity metrics with forecasted free cash flow of up to $480 million in the next five years. The acquisition would help the combined entity to yield superior risk-adjusted returns in the coming years.Zacks Rank and Other Stock to ConsiderSandRidge is engaged in the development and production activities of oil and gas.

Both Tulsa-based Midstates Petroleum and Oklahoma-based SandRidge have prominent presence in Mississippian Lime and the merger would be likely to unlock substantial synergies for both companies.Following the news of the offer, SandRidge shares rose more than 2.2% to eventually close at $16.87 on Feb 6. On the other hand, Midstates Petroleum stock dipped around 1% to eventually close at $15.30 following the announcement.This comes almost after a month SandRidge cancelled its plan to acquire Colorado-based Bonanza Creek Energy (BCEI  -  Free Report) amid shareholders’ strong opposition.Details of the DealSandRidge shareholders would be expected to receive 1.068 shares of Midstates Petroleum’s for each share held, according to the proposed deal, per its closing price as on Feb 5. SandRidge shareholders would own a 60% stake in the combined company, with the remaining interest held by Midstates Petroleum. The combined entity would likely be valued at nearly $1 billion.According to the proposal, Midstates’ CEO David J. Sambrooks would serve as the chief controller of new entity. The proposal also supports the prolonged efforts of Fir Tree Partners and Carl Icahn — two of the biggest shareholders in both SandRidge and Midstates Petroleum — who have long criticized SandRidge’s managerial decisions and wanted a change in the company’s leadership position.The new entity would own more than 450,000 net acres in the core of the Mississippian Lime play, with the production capacity of over 53,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. In addition, the combined company would also hold 75,000 net acres in the Northwest STACK play.Benefits of the DealThe merger would benefit from complementary assets which would likely lead to various financial, commercial and operational synergies. It would lead to cost synergies of around $70 million annually, generating free cash flow of over $100 million. The deal would lead to significant value addition for both companies.  Both companies have emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy after successfully completing debt restructuring. SandRidge recovered from bankruptcy in October 2016 after reorganizing $4.1 billion in debt, while MIdstates Petroleum came out of the same in December 2016 after writing off $2 billion in debt.The proposed combined company would not have any debt and would display strong liquidity metrics with forecasted free cash flow of up to $480 million in the next five years. The acquisition would help the combined entity to yield superior risk-adjusted returns in the coming years.Zacks Rank and Other Stock to ConsiderSandRidge is engaged in the development and production activities of oil and gas.

365,OXY,"U.S. bourses have suffered the worst fall in six years, triggering a worldwide bloodbath of stocks. It has severely affected investors who had vouched for an extended period of market calm. The major cause of the selling is concerns over inflation and rising interest rates that pushed bond yields higher at the expense of stocks.With the markets witnessing a healthy pullback after a strong run, investing in stocks that provide excellent risk-adjusted returns seems judicious.Steepest Sell-Off Since 2011The Dow has tanked 1,175 points, or 4.6%, to 24,345.75 at the closing bell on Feb 5 — marking the steepest one-day drop since Aug 10, 2011. All the 30 components of the blue-chip index ended in the red.The S&P 500 shed 113.19 points, or 4.1%, to 2,648.94. The large-cap index’s percentage drop was the largest since Aug 18, 2011. It was also almost close to a 5% pullback. The index had somehow managed to complete 406 sessions without such a decline, registering its longest period without a 5% pullback in 20 years. All the S&P 500 sectors were down as well. The financial sector declined the maximum at 5%. Other sectors that fell more than 4% were healthcare, industrials, energy, telecommunications and information technology. They were followed by consumer cyclicals and utilities, which lost 3.3% and 1.7%, respectively.Such a sell-off followed last week’s worst weekly decline for the Dow and the S&P 500 in more than two years. The indices turned negative for the year, while the Nasdaq managed to retain a gain of 0.9%. Nevertheless, the tech-laden index dropped 273.42 points, or 3.8%, to end yesterday’s session at 6,967.53.The day’s broad-based weakness drove the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX), Wall Street’s so-called fear gauge, 104% to 35.02, its highest since August 2015, per FactSet. The VIX shows expectations of volatility in the broader market, and trades inversely to the major benchmarks roughly 80% of the time.Robust Jobs Data — Major Reason for the TumbleEveryone one was quick to name the culprit and it was the jobs data. Stronger-than-expected job addition along with fastest wage growth in more than eight years sparked fears of inflation and bolstered expectations that the Fed could take a more aggressive stance in hiking rates than previously expected. In fact, the U.S. 10-year bond yields touched a four-year high as investors continue to take money away from the equity market and flee into treasury for safety. The 10-year treasury note at one point jumped as high as 2.883%, but, ended the day at 2.72%.Coming to the jobs report, the labor market has come a long way since the Great Recession, with broad-based job gains recorded in January. Non-farm payrolls climbed 200,000 jobs last month after rising 160,000 last December, per the Labor Department. In fact, the economy added jobs for 88 successive months, while unemployment rate remained at a 17-year low of 4.1%.Average hourly wages increased 9 cents, or 0.3%, to $26.74. This helped the average year-on-year hourly earnings to rise to 2.9%, the highest since June 2009. Wages grew at the fastest pace since the end of the last decade on a tighter labor market, tax cut policy and a rise in the minimum wage threshold in several states. Minimum wage has been raised in 18 states in January, which had a positive impact on 4.5 million workers, per the Economic Policy Institute (read more: Wages See Fastest Growth Since 2009: Top 5 Gainers).Buy These 5 Ultra-Safe Stocks NowGiven the aforesaid factors, it seems like Wall Street is facing a bloodbath. After all, the stock market’s tried-and-tested policy of buying the dip that involves scooping up companies at attractive valuations following sell-offs has failed to boost equities this time around. Moreover, market pundits have been predicting a correction for quite some time. The stock market has remained calmed for a pretty long time, courtesy of a sturdy economy and low interest rates. But, as evident, such things don’t last long.Taking this into consideration mind, let’s take a look at which stocks are worth a bet at the moment. Investors should build a strategy on low-risk assets and a combination of parameters that lead to better returns. The best way to go about doing this is by creating a portfolio of low-beta stocks, which are inherently less volatile than the markets they trade in.

366,OXY,"It was a week where the price of oil rallied. However, natural gas futures were down slightly.On the news front, energy biggies Occidental Petroleum Corporation (OXY  -  Free Report), The Williams Companies, Inc. (WMB  -  Free Report) and Marathon Oil Corporation (MRO  -  Free Report) came up with strong earnings reports.  Overall, it was a mixed week for the sector. While West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures gained about 4.2% to close at $61.68 per barrel, while natural gas prices lost 1% to $2.558 per million Btu (MMBtu). (See the last ‘Oil & Gas Stock Roundup’ here: Earnings Beats & Dividend Hikes from Total, Anadarko & Suncor)The U.S. oil benchmark recorded its second increase in five weeks. The major catalyst was the Energy Department's inventory release, which revealed that crude stockpiles recorded a lower-than-expected weekly build. A tumbling dollar – that made the greenback-priced crude more affordable for investors holding foreign currency – provided further support.Meanwhile, natural gas prices dropped last week despite a larger-than-expected decrease in supplies. The decline was primarily on account of strength in the commodity’s production Investors were also spooked by forecasts of warmer weather, leading to the heating fuel’s tepid demand.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    Houston-based energy explorer Occidental Petroleum reported fourth-quarter 2017 earnings of 41 cents per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. In the year-ago quarter, the Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company had posted a loss of 13 cents. The outperformance was owing to improvement in worldwide sales volume and realized price of oil and natural gas liquids. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Occidental Petroleum’s average daily net oil, liquids and gas production volume increased to 621,000 barrels of oil equivalents per day (boe/d) from 583,000 boe/d reported in the year-ago quarter. This increase could be attributed to increased drilling activity and well productivity in the Permian Resources region.Occidental Petroleum’s proved reserves at the end of 2017 were 2.6 billion barrels of oil equivalent, out of which 60% is located in the United States and the rest in other international locations. Finding and development costs (F&D) were $8.53 per BOE in 2017 compared with $9.65 per BOE in 2016. (Read more Occidental Tops Q4 Earnings Estimates, Issues Guidance)2.    Energy infrastructure provider The Williams Companies reported adjusted earnings from continuing operations of 20 cents per share in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The bottom line improved from the prior-year figure of 17 cents per share. Better year-over-year results can be attributed to absence of impairment charges associated with equity method investments and favorable changes in the income tax provision.During the reported quarter, Williams Companies’ capital expenditure was $699 million. As of Dec 31, 2017, the company had cash and cash equivalents of 899 million compared with $170 million in the year ago quarter. Long-term debt of the company was $20,434 million, representing a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 67.9%.The company issued a preliminary guidance for 2018, wherein it anticipates the net income from its major segment Williams Partners to be within the range of $1.5-$1.7 billion range.  Williams Companies expects the annual dividend growth rate of 10-15% for 2018 and 2019, with the dividend-coverage ratio of 1.35x.(Read more Williams Companies Q4 Earnings in Line, Sales Top)3.    Upstream energy firm Marathon Oil posted fourth-quarter adjusted income of 7 cents per share, ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 2 cents. In the year-earlier quarter, the company incurred adjusted loss of 10 cents. The strong numbers came thanks to higher production and the recovery in crude prices. In particular, total quarterly output rose 12% year over year to 383,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day (BOE/d).The company’s exploration expenses for the quarter came at $57 million, higher than $34 million in the year-earlier quarter. Moreover, Marathon Oil’s total quarterly cost and expenses rose 7.3% to 1,174 million.During the year, Marathon Oil spent $2,100 million on capital programs, in line with its guidance. The company announced a 2018 capital program of $2,300 million, with 90% of the outlay earmarked for high return U.S. resource plays.Marathon Oil expects first-quarter 2018 United States E&P output available for sale in the range of 265,000–275,000 BOE/d and International E&P output in the range of 105,000–115,000 BOE/d.

The prime reservoir of the project – discovered in March 2015 – holds approximately 1.5 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.BP was able to start production from the Atoll field seven months before it was planned. Moreover, the company was successful in reducing the operating cost of the upstream project by 33% from its initial projection. BP’s daily oil and natural gas production from the field currently stands at 10,000 barrels and 350 million cubic feet, respectively.Investors should know that Atoll Phase One project is the first key upstream development of BP, having initiated operations in 2018. During 2016 and 2017, BP managed to bring 13 key developments online, which already boosted the company’s daily production by more than 500,000 barrels of oil equivalent (BoE). The firm believes that all these major projects might help reach its target worth 900,000 BoE of daily new output by 2021. (Read more BP Commences Oil & Natural Gas Production From Atoll Field)5.    Energy giant ExxonMobil Corp. (XOM  -  Free Report) recently agreed to divest its 50% stake in the Scarborough gas field offshore Western Australia to Woodside Petroleum Ltd for $744 million. The gas field is located in the Carnarvon Basin.The divestment can shrink ExxonMobil's risky asset portfolio and give an opportunity to focus on comparatively cheaper offshore liquefied natural gas (“LNG”) prospects in Papua New Guinea, Mozambique and others.Moreover, the company was of the opinion that the economic development of the gas field involved a few challenges like water depth, resource characteristics and execution complexities. With production unlikely to start before 2025, short-run payoff from the field is not available.Additionally, offshore drilling is excessively expensive that might dent the company’s cash flow. The Scarborough project’s overall estimated cost was $9.7 billion. ExxonMobil’s move is likely to enable the company to improve its cash flow situation.

The best performer was independent refiner Valero Energy Corp. (VLO  -  Free Report), whose stock soared 7.5%.Longer-term, over 6 months, the sector tracker is up 8.7%. Valero Energy was again the major gainer during this period, experiencing a 41.4% price appreciation.What’s Next in the Energy World?As usual, market participants will be closely tracking the regular releases i.e. the U.S. government statistics on oil and natural gas - one of the few solid indicators that comes out regularly. Energy traders will also be focusing on the Baker Hughes data on rig count.However, the 2017 Q4 earnings again remain the primary focus this week, with a number of S&P 500 members coming out with quarterly results.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

367,OXY,"BP plc (BP  -  Free Report) is expected to report fourth-quarter 2017 earnings on Feb 6, before the opening bell. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 14%. Also, the company was able to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in three of the prior four quarters, the average positive surprise being 26.8%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Which Way Are Estimates Treading?Let’s look at the estimate revisions in order to get a clear picture of what analysts expect from the company’s upcoming earnings release.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earnings of 66 cents has been stable in the last seven days. It reflects year-over-year growth of 407.7%.BP p.l.c. Price and EPS Surprise  BP p.l.c. Price and EPS Surprise | BP p.l.c. Quote Factors to ConsiderFollowing the ongoing ramp up of key upstream developments, BP expects production to increase sequentially in the October-to-December quarter.Also, the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude increased almost 20% in the October-to-December quarter of 2017, per The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). Through most of November and the entire December, the commodity traded above the $55-per-barrel psychological mark. The extension of the production cut deal by OPEC players supported the rally in crude. On Nov 30, 2017, OPEC members met non-OPEC players to decide on an extension of the crude production cut accord, first signed in late 2016, beyond the first quarter of 2018. More than 20 oil producers, including leading exporters like Russia and Saudi Arabia, participated in the meeting. As expected by most analysts, all crude exporters decided to extend the deal through 2018-end. Saudi Arabia, Russia and their allies have pledged to put 1.8 million barrels a day of crude oil out of the market through the end of this year.The improvement in oil price along with higher expected quarterly production by the company will likely fetch BP impressive profits from upstream business.However, for fourth-quarter 2017, the company expects refining margin to decline sequentially owing to turnaround activities.  Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that BP is likely to beat estimates this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.  Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 66 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.  Zacks Rank: BP carries a Zacks Rank #1. Though a favorable Zacks Rank increases the predictive power of ESP, the company’s 0.00% ESPmakes surprise prediction difficult.Meanwhile, we caution investors against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions. Stocks to ConsiderThough an earnings beat looks uncertain for BP, here are a few firms that you may want to consider on the basis of our model. These have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Headquartered in Irving, TX, Pioneer Natural Resources Company (PXD  -  Free Report) is an upstream energy player, primarily exploring oil and gas. The company has an Earnings ESP of +5.53% and a Zacks Rank #1.

(MPC  -  Free Report) raised their respective quarterly dividends. Meanwhile, driller Helmerich & Payne Inc. (HP  -  Free Report) came out with better-than-expected first-quarter fiscal 2018 results.Overall, it was a good week for the sector. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures gained about 4.5% to close at $66.14 per barrel, while natural gas prices soared 10% to $3.505 per million Btu (MMBtu). (See the last ‘Oil & Gas Stock Roundup’ here: Schlumberger & Halliburton's Q4, BP's Horizon Woes & More)The U.S. oil benchmark recorded its fifth increase in six weeks, attaining its highest closing since December 2014. The major catalyst was the Energy Department's inventory release, which revealed that crude stockpiles recorded another weekly draw. A tumbling dollar – that made the greenback-priced crude more affordable for investors holding foreign currency – provided further support.Oil stockpiles have shrunk in 34 of the last 42 weeks and are down almost 114 million barrels since April. The gradual fall has helped the U.S. crude market shift from year-over-year storage surplus to a deficit. At 411.6 million barrels, current crude supplies are 15.7% below the year-ago period and the lowest since February 2015.Meanwhile, natural gas – one of 2017’s worst-performing commodities – had an excellent week of its own following a larger-than-expected decrease in supplies.

The Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company will now reward shareholders with a dividend of 46 cents per share compared with 40 cents earlier. This translates to an annualized dividend of $1.84 per share. The increased dividend will be paid on Mar 12, 2018 to shareholders of record as of Feb 21, 2018. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The oil refining and marketing giant was able to pull off the dividend hike due to the strategic actions it undertook last year for generating long-term cash flow. Notably, Marathon Petroleum's $8.1 billion drop-down deal with its midstream subsidiary MPLX L.P. bodes well for the company as it will lead to huge cash influx, boosting dividend and buyback programs. Moreover, the recent tax reform by the U.S. government has reduced the company's cash burden, leading to the hike.Marathon Petroleum is known for raising dividends since it became a standalone public company in mid-2011. Additionally, it has an active share repurchase program. These highlight the company’s commitment to return more value to shareholders. Notably, the dividend hikes and buybacks, since the company's inception, have totaled $13 billion.

The outperformance was primarily driven by higher drilling activity at its biggest segment – U.S. Land. The bottom line also compared favorably with the year-ago adjusted loss of 41 cents.During the quarter, operating revenues at its U.S. Land unit totaled $461.6 million (81.8% of total revenues), up 75.1% year over year. While average rig revenue per operating day was $22,400 — 10.7% below the year-ago period — average rig margin per day was down 7.6% to $8,854. However, utilization levels of 57% in the quarter under review (versus 31% in first-quarter fiscal 2017) resulted in an operating income of 24.7 million at the segment marking a turnaround from the year-ago loss of $30.9 million.The company expects activity in the U.S. land segment to rise by 3-4% sequentially during the second fiscal quarter of 2018. While the average rig revenue per day is likely to be flat compared with the first fiscal quarter, daily average rig cost is expected to be roughly $13,900 during next quarter.During the quarter, Helmerich & Payne spent approximately $91.7 million on capital programs. As of Dec 31, 2017, the company had approximately $383.7 million in cash, while long-term debt stood at $493.2 million (debt-to-capitalization ratio of 9.7%).

(PTEN  -  Free Report) shares declined more than 2% in the wake of an explosion in a well in Quinton, OK, owned by Red Mountain Energy. The tragedy, one of the deadliest oil and gas related accidents in the last few years, occurred at one of Patterson-UTI's APEX 1500 rigs. The rig had operated for 10 days and dug 13,500 feet when the accident took place. Notably, the company has 25 drilling rigs online in the state.Although the reason for the explosion is still not clear, gas from the well may have been a factor. Out of the 22 workers at the site, 16 managed to escape while five went missing. Their bodies were found in an adjacent building, one day after the explosion took place. Three of them were working for Patterson-UTI.Halliburton’s well control and prevention service providing unit, Boots & Coots was summoned to extinguish the fire at this eastern Oklahoma site.

370,OXY,"The U.S. Energy Department's inventory release showed that crude stockpiles recorded another weekly draw to the lowest level since 2015. As a result, the front month West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures moved up 1.8% (or $1.14) to end at $65.61 per barrel yesterday – the highest settlement since December 2014.But the positive effect from the record tenth straight crude inventory withdrawal was partly offset by builds in gasoline and distillate supplies. On a further bearish note, domestic oil production revisited its rising trend that continues to be the biggest headwind for the market.Analysis of the EIA DataCrude Oil: The federal government’s EIA report revealed that crude inventories fell by 1.1 million barrels for the week ending Jan 19, following a decrease of 6.9 million barrels in the previous week. The analysts surveyed by S&P Global Platts – the leading independent commodities and energy data provider – had expected crude stocks to go down some 1.6 million barrels.An uptick in exports led to the stockpile draw with the world's biggest oil consumer. However, the withdrawal failed to match expectations as U.S. output edged up 128,000 barrels per day last week to 9.9 million barrels per day – tantalizingly close to the all-time record of just over 10 million barrels per day set in 1970.Oil stockpiles have shrunk in 34 of the last 42 weeks and are down almost 122 million barrels since April. The gradual fall has helped the U.S. crude market shift from year-over-year storage surplus to a deficit. At 411.6 million barrels, current crude supplies are 15.7% below the year-ago period and the lowest since February 2015 though they are in the middle of the average range during this time of the year.Meanwhile, stocks at the Cushing terminal in Oklahoma – the key delivery hub for U.S. crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange – was down by 3.2 million barrels to three-year lows of 39.2 million barrels.The crude supply cover was up from 23.9 days in the previous week to 24.1 days. In the year-ago period, the supply cover was 29.5 days.Gasoline: Supplies of gasoline were up for the eleventh straight week on the strength of imports. The 3.1 million barrels addition – more than the polled number of 2.1 million barrels rise in supply level – took gasoline stockpiles up to 244 million barrels. Despite last week’s increase, the stock of the most widely used petroleum product remains 3.6% below the year-earlier level and is in the middle of the average range.Distillate: Distillate fuel supplies (including diesel and heating oil) gained 639,000 barrels last week, contrary to analysts’ expectations for 2.5 million barrels decrease in supply level. The weekly rise could be attributed to tepid demand. But at 139.8 million barrels, current supplies are still 17.3% below the year-ago level and are in the lower half of the average range for this time of the year.Refinery Rates: Refinery utilization was down by 2.1% from the prior week to 90.9%.About the Weekly Petroleum Status ReportThe Energy Information Administration (EIA) Petroleum Status Report, containing data of the previous week ending Friday, outlines information regarding the weekly change in petroleum inventories held and produced by the U.S., both locally and abroad.The report provides an overview of the level of reserves and their movements, thereby helping investors understand the demand/supply dynamics of petroleum products. It is an indicator of current oil prices and volatility that affect the businesses of the companies engaged in the oil and refining industry.The data from EIA generally acts as a catalyst for crude prices and affect producers, such as ExxonMobil Corp. (XOM  -  Free Report), Chevron Corp. (CVX  -  Free Report) and ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report), and refiners such as Valero Energy Corp.

373,OXY,"Schlumberger Limited (SLB  -  Free Report) is expected to report fourth-quarter 2017 earnings on Jan 19, before the opening bell.  Last quarter, the company’s earnings of 42 cents per share were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Also, the company posted an average positive earnings surprise of 4.17% for the last four quarters.  Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to the announcement.Which Way Are Estimates Headed?Let’s look at the estimate revision trend to get a clear picture of what analysts expect from the earnings release.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of 44 cents for the fourth quarter has been stable in the last seven days. It reflects growth of about almost 63% from the year-ago quarter.Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $8,116 million for the quarter, up 14.2% from the prior-year quarter.Factors to ConsiderThe West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude increased almost 20% in the October-to-December quarter of 2017, per The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). Through most of November and the entire December, the commodity traded above the $55-per-barrel psychological mark. The extension of the production cut deal by OPEC players supported the rally in crude. On Nov 30, 2017, OPEC members met non-OPEC players to decide on an extension of the crude production cut accord, first signed in late 2016, beyond the first quarter of 2018. More than 20 oil producers, including leading exporters like Russia and Saudi Arabia, participated in the meeting. As expected by most analysts, all crude exporters decided to extend the deal through 2018-end. Saudi Arabia, Russia, and their allies have pledged to put 1.8 million barrels a day of crude oil out of the market through the end of this year.Improvement in crude price will likely be favorable for Schlumberger as oilfield service businesses are positively correlated with crude price. This is reflected in the Zacks Consensus Estimate for each of the company’s business segments.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Reservoir Characterization segment’s earnings-before-tax stands at $318 million, higher than $316 million recorded in the year-earlier quarter.Moreover, for the Drilling unit, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings stands at $307 million, up from $234 million in the prior-year quarter.The balance sheet looks solid as Schlumberger’s total current assets of $19.9 billion — as of Sep 30, 2017 — is higher than $13 billion of current liabilities. The long-term debt level is slightly discouraging as $15.9 billion is higher than $10.6 billion as of Dec 31, 2014.  Q4 Price PerformanceIn the fourth quarter, shares of Schlumberger underperformed the industry. The stock lost 3.4% compared with the industry’s decline of 1.8%.  Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Schlumberger is likely to beat estimates this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is -3.01%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at 43 cents, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at 44 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Schlumberger carries a Zacks Rank #3. Though a favorable Zacks Rank increases the predictive power of ESP, the company’s negative Earnings ESP makes surprise prediction difficult. Meanwhile, we caution investors against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell Rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.  Stocks to ConsiderThough an earnings beat looks uncertain for Schlumberger, here are a few firms that you may want to consider on the basis of our model. These have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Headquartered in Irving, TX, Pioneer Natural Resources Company (PXD  -  Free Report) primarily explores oil and gas and hence is an upstream energy player. The company has an Earnings ESP of +2.45% and sports a Zacks Rank #1.

374,OXY,"As we enter the Q4 earnings season, this week will see reports from key energy companies. The partial recovery in crude price has strengthened the financial metrics of the energy sector — as represented by the Zacks Oil-Energy sector — and helped them pay off a part of their huge debt.The sector now has sufficient net operating cashflow to fund their capital spending. Also, the energy sector’s 3.7% dividend yield is lucrative, and is more than the 1.8% yield of the S&P 500.  We believe that the fourth-quarter earnings season will likely see the strongest gain from the energy sector among all Zacks sectors.Higher Oil & Gas PricesThe West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude increased almost 20% in the October-to-December quarter of 2017, per The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). Through most of November and the entire December, the commodity traded above the $55-per-barrel psychological mark. The extension of the production cut deal by OPEC players supported the rally in crude.  On Nov 30, 2017, OPEC members met non-OPEC players to decide on an extension of the crude production cut accord, first signed in late 2016, beyond the first quarter of 2018.

As expected by most analysts, all crude exporters decided to extend the deal through 2018-end. Through the end of this year, Saudi Arabia, Russia, and their allies have pledged to put 1.8 million barrels a day of crude oil out of the market.Like oil, natural gas has been in the bullish territory after gaining more than 25% through the fourth-quarter 2017.Q4 Earnings Growth Likely to be ImpressiveAmong all the 16 Zacks sectors defining the S&P 500 index, energy will likely witness the strongest earnings growth in the fourth quarter, per our latest Earnings Preview. In other words, energy will likely be the only Zacks sector to report triple-digit earnings growth.For the October-to-December quarter, we expect energy to post 178.5% earnings growth on 24.1% higher revenues. The rise in fourth-quarter earnings will likely be more than 152.3% recorded in third-quarter 2017.  Bet on Oil/Energy StocksCrude and natural gas prices determine the fate of the energy players. With the massive fourth-quarter crude and gas improvements, upstream energy players are expected to report strong Q4 numbers. Companies involved in exploration and production activities will likely gain, while contract drilling players and drilling equipment makers are expected to clinch more contracts. Choosing stocks with earnings beat potential might be a difficult task unless one knows the way to shortlist. One way to do this is to pick stocks that have the combination of a favorable Zacks Rank — #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — and a positive Earnings ESP.Earnings ESP is our proprietary methodology for identifying stocks that have high chances of surprising in their upcoming earnings announcements. It shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Our research shows that for stocks with this combination, the chance of a positive earnings surprise is as high as 70%.Headquartered in Irving, TX, Pioneer Natural Resources Company (PXD  -  Free Report) is a leading upstream energy player with operations in the Permian Basin and Eagle Ford Shale region.The company, expected to report Q4 numbers on Feb 6, sports a Zacks Rank #1 and an Earnings ESP of +2.45%.

375,OXY,"Kinder Morgan Inc (KMI  -  Free Report) is expected to post fourth-quarter 2017 earnings on Jan 17.Last quarter, the company delivered an earnings surprise of 7.1%. Moreover, Kinder Morgan delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 1.8% in the last four quarters. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to the announcement.Which Way are Estimates Treading?Let’s look at the estimate revisions to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company before earnings release.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of 18 cents for the fourth quarter has been stable in the last 30 days. It reflects growth of about 12.5% from the year-ago quarter. Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $3,324 million for the impending quarter, down 0.2% from the prior-year quarter.Factors to ConsiderKinder Morgan has the largest network of natural gas pipelines in North America, spread over almost 70,000 miles. Notably, the company’s midstream properties are linked to all the prospective plays in the United States, which are rich in natural gas.These extensive networks of natural gas pipelines, for which the company has invested billions of dollars, provide stable fee-based revenues. In fact, Kinder Morgan expects 91% of its 2017 cash flow generation to come from fees charged for midstream properties. The revenues from midstream properties will be reflected in the quarterly results.However, Kinder Morgan’s weak balance sheet is a concern. As of third-quarter 2017, total debt — short and long term — is pegged at $38.3 billion. Debt capital is higher than total equity capital of $36.5 billion which depicts the company’s significant exposure to debt. If debt continues to grow, the company may face liquidity issues.Moreover, the company’s Trans Mountain pipeline expansion faces threats. Being a part of the legal dispute, the successful appeal is expected to nullify the federal sanction for the C$7.4-billion or $5.9-billion Trans Mountain project and result in long postponement. This will be a major drawback for the company.Price Performance in Q4During the quarter, Kinder Morgan has underperformed the industry. In the aforesaid period, the stock has lost 5.8% compared with the industry’s decline of 3%. Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Kinder Morgan is likely to beat earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for the company is -1.16%.

Total revenues were up 41.8% from the year-ago figure of $2,808 million.This year-over-year improvement in total revenues were primarily due to strong contribution from its Upstream business, and Marketing and midstream businesses.Highlights of the ReleaseIn the fourth quarter of 2017, total production touched 548,000 barrels of oil equivalent (Boe) per day.  The actual production was lower than the expected range of 551,000-571,000 Boe per day. In the quarter, net production in the United States was limited by nearly 9,000 barrels per day primarily due to the timing of well tie-ins associated with non-operated activity in the STACK.Devon’s midstream business generated operating profits of $272 million, expanding 35% year to date.

378,OXY,"The U.S. Energy Department's inventory release showed that crude stockpiles recorded a higher-than-expected weekly draw to the lowest level since 2015 on strong refining demand.But the positive effect from the hefty crude inventory draw was partly offset by another build in gasoline and distillate supplies. On a further bearish note, domestic oil production revisited its rising trend that continues to be the biggest headwind for the market.As a result, the front month West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures edged up 0.3-6% (or 38 cents) to end at $62.01 per barrel yesterday – the highest settlement since December 2014.Energy Stocks on a RollWith the federal data showing the seventh consecutive week of U.S. stockpiles decline, energy stocks have been in a strong uptrend lately.The two energy representatives in the 30-stock Dow Jones industrial average, ExxonMobil (XOM  -  Free Report) and Chevron (CVX  -  Free Report) added 3.9% and 6%, respectively, in the past month. Meanwhile, some of the biggest gainers of the S&P 500 during the period were oil and oil-related stocks like Marathon Oil Corp. (MRO  -  Free Report), Halliburton (HAL  -  Free Report), Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO  -  Free Report), and Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (APC  -  Free Report).Analysis of the EIA DataCrude Oil: The federal government’s EIA report revealed that crude inventories fell by 7.4 million barrels for the week ending Dec 29, following a decrease of 4.6 million barrels in the previous week. The analysts surveyed by S&P Global Platts – the leading independent commodities and energy data provider – had expected crude stocks to go down some 5.7 million barrels.An uptick in refinery demand led to the larger-than-expected stockpile draw with the world's biggest oil consumer even as U.S. output edged up 28,000 barrels per day last week to 9.8 million barrels per day – just 9,000 barrels per day short of last month’s record levels.Oil stockpiles have shrunk in 31 of the last 39 weeks and are down almost 109 million barrels since April. The gradual fall has helped the U.S. crude market shift from year-over-year storage surplus to a deficit. At 424.5 million barrels, current crude supplies are 11.4% below the year-ago period and the lowest since 2015 though they are in the middle of the average range during this time of the year.Meanwhile, stocks at the Cushing terminal in Oklahoma – the key delivery hub for U.S. crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange – was down by 2.4 million barrels to 49 million barrels.The crude supply cover was down from 25.2 days in the previous week to 24.6 days. In the year-ago period, the supply cover was 28.9 days.Gasoline: Supplies of gasoline were up for the eighth straight week on weak demand. The 4.8 million barrels addition – more than double the polled number of 2 million barrels rise in supply level – took gasoline stockpiles up to 233.2 million barrels. Despite last week’s increase, the stock of the most widely used petroleum product remains 1% below the year-earlier level and is also above the upper limit of the average range.Distillate: Distillate fuel supplies (including diesel and heating oil) soared 8.9 million barrels last week, dwarfing analysts’ expectations for 1.3 million barrels increase in supply level. The massive weekly rise could be attributed to higher output and tepid demand. But at 138.8 million barrels, current supplies are still 14.2% below the year-ago level and are in the middle of the average range for this time of the year.Refinery Rates: Refinery utilization was up by 1% from the prior week to 96.7% - the highest since 2005. The operators kept processing large volumes of crude into products to circumvent year-end tax payments on stocks.About the Weekly Petroleum Status ReportThe Energy Information Administration (EIA) Petroleum Status Report, containing data of the previous week ending Friday, outlines information regarding the weekly change in petroleum inventories held and produced by the U.S., both locally and abroad.The report provides an overview of the level of reserves and their movements, thereby helping investors understand the demand/supply dynamics of petroleum products. It is an indicator of current oil prices and volatility that affect the businesses of the companies engaged in the oil and refining industry.Want to Own an Energy Stock Now?If you are looking for a near-term energy play, Occidental Petroleum Corp.

380,OXY,"It was a week where the price of oil spiked to its highest settlement since June 2015. However, natural gas futures fell sharply.On the news front, Anglo-Dutch oil giant Royal Dutch Shell plc (RDS.A  -  Free Report) announced the expansion of its electric vehicle charging business through a partnership with Munich-based venture IONITY, while Brazil’s Petrobras (PBR  -  Free Report) started oil production from its Libra field off Rio de Janeiro.Overall, it was a mixed week for the sector. While West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures gained 4% to close at $58.95 per barrel, natural gas prices slumped 9.2% to $2.813 per million Btu (MMBtu). (See the last ‘Oil & Gas Stock Roundup’ here: Keystone XL's Approval, BP's Buyback & More)The U.S. oil benchmark rallied to two-and-half year high on expectations that OPEC and other major producers will agree to expand their output-cut deal beyond March when they meet at the end of the month. The agreement, already renewed once, keeps 1.8 million barrels a day off the market in an attempt to clear a supply glut.Further support came from the U.S. Energy Department's inventory release, which showed a decline in crude stockpiles.The shutdown of TransCanada Corporation’s 590,000 barrel-per-day Keystone oil pipeline – one of the largest from Canada to the United States – due to a leak and subsequent cleanup operations, was also bullish for oil prices.Meanwhile, natural gas futures logged a big decline following a smaller-than-expected decrease in supplies. Unfavorable weather forecasts and strength in the commodity’s production also fueled the downside.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    In a bid to bolster its electric-vehicle (EV) charging business, European oil giant Royal Dutch Shell plc is set to collaborate with EV-focused charging operator IONITY.IONITY— one of the most significant developments in the EV infrastructure — is a joint venture (JV) formed by world’s major carmakers namely BMW Group, Daimler AG, Ford Motor Company, and Volkswagen Group with Audi and Porsche. The Munich-based JV, set up only a few weeks ago, aims at designing around 400 high-power charging stations across Europe by 2020.Per the deal, Shell is likely to launch around 80 charging networks across Europe by 2019. The charging stations will be deployed in Belgium, Britain, France, the Netherlands, Austria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia. The charging points to be installed by the partnership are likely to top up the electric vehicles in around 5-8 minutes.With this deal, Shell wants to cash in on the wide acceptance of the electric cars and thereby increase customer base and revenues. Shell believes that the deal will provide customers range of refueling choices in future and bring diversification to its asset portfolio.

The offshore oil field is located 200 kilometers south of Rio de Janeiro.

The FPSO vessel is the company's first unit capable of reinjecting all the gas produced during the tests that will induce the flow of crude oil. The unit has a processing capacity of 50,000 barrels of oil and 4 million cubic meters of gas per day.Brazil has huge oil reservoirs that lie below the Espírito Santo, Campos and Santos basins in deep and ultra-deep water. These reserves, estimated to hold 50 billion barrels, are widely thought to be the most important oil finds in recent years.

382,OXY,"Markets are a little more than halfway through the Q2 earnings season, with 57.2% S&P 500 members having reported results as of Friday, Apr 28.Picture Emerging Thus FarWe now have Q2 results from 286 S&P 500 members that combined account for 68.8% of the index’s total market capitalization. According to the latest Earnings Preview, total earnings for these companies are up 11.3 from the same period last year on 6.1% higher revenues, with 74.5% positive earnings surprises and 69.2% beating revenue estimates.Energy Earnings SoarThe ‘Energy’ sector has been off to a spectacular start. For the 48.5% sector components on the S&P 500 index that have reported Q2 results, total earnings surged 226.2% on 15.5% higher revenues. While 50% of the companies have been successful in beating earnings estimates, 81.3% outperformed the top line.Energy: First Half RecapLast year, 'Energy' was the strongest S&P sector performer, with a market-thumping 24% return. In particular, November's historic OPEC-led production cut deal to alleviate a supply glut managed to buoy oil prices and stabilize them around the psychologically important $50 per barrel threshold. The commodity was on a stellar run on optimism surrounding the agreement, and the outlook for oil stocks was getting better.The seemingly positive developments encouraged investors to bet on firming prices for 2017 with the oil industry finally hoping that 'this would be the year.' True to the strong sentiments, U.S. oil prices reached around $55 per barrel in late February, the highest level in 19 months.However, the situation is drastically different now, with the commodity floundering in recent weeks. By Jun 21, crude had cratered more than 20% from its February highs and officially plunged into bear territory. In fact, prices ended down 14.3% for the first half of the year – the worst performance since 1998.Let's take a look at how oil and gas prices behaved during the second quarter of this year.Strong Q2 Earnings Growth PredictionA look back at the Q1 earnings season reflects that the overall results of the Oil/Energy sector were spectacular, driving the aggregate growth picture for the S&P 500 index.The Jan-Mar 2017 period turned out to be a rather good one with both oil and natural gas prices benefiting from easier comparison figures from the year-ago period. While crude slumped to some 12-year low in the first quarter of 2016, natural gas futures dropped to its worst level in almost 17 years.As a result, the sector – whose year-earlier comparison was to an aggregate loss – came out swinging. For the sector components on the S&P 500 index, total Q1 earnings saw robust year-over-year dollar growth on 33.8% higher revenues. While 69.7% of the companies were successful in beating earnings estimates, 63.6% outperformed the top line.The picture looks rather encouraging for the upcoming Q2 earnings season as well. This is not surprising, considering that oil and gas are both averaging higher compared to the second quarter of 2016 when the energy companies reported unusually low bottom line. While earnings for the Oil/Energy sector are set to jump a massive 249.0% – the highest year-over-year growth among all sectors – the top line is likely to show an improvement of 16.5% from the second-quarter 2016 levels.Stocks to Watch for Earnings on Aug 2Let’s see what’s in store for four energy companies expected to come up with June quarter numbers on Wednesday, Aug 2, after market close.First, we have energy infrastructure provider The Williams Companies Inc. (WMB  -  Free Report). In the previous quarter, this Tulsa, OK-headquartered transporter of oil and gas missed estimates, weighed down by rising costs and expenses.Regarding earnings surprises, The Williams Companies has a decent record, having missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate just once in the last four reports. And our model indicates that the company is likely to beat on earnings this time around too.This is because, as per our proven model, a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to beat estimates. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.For the quarter to be reported, The Williams Companies has an Earnings ESP of +50.00% and a Zacks Rank #3, wh the right combination of two key ingredients. (Read more: Is Williams Companies Poised for a Beat in Q2 Earnings?)Simultaneously, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Williams Companies, Inc. (The) Price and EPS Surprise  Williams Companies, Inc. (The) Price and EPS Surprise | Williams Companies, Inc. (The) QuoteHeadquartered in Houston, TX, Occidental petroleum Corp. (OXY  -  Free Report) is another energy player set to report second-quarter 2017 results. The company – with significant exploration and production exposure, together with chemical and midstream operations – has a mixed track of having outperformed estimates in two of the last four quarters.However, Occidental Petroleum is not expected to add to its positive surprises in the to-be-reported quarter. This is because the company has a Zacks Rank #4 and an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. (Read more: Is Disappointment Likely for Occidental in Q2 Earnings?)Occidental Petroleum Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Occidental Petroleum Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Occidental Petroleum Corporation QuoteThen there is Houston, TX-based leading upstream energy firm Marathon Oil Corp. (MRO  -  Free Report) coming up with April-June operational results.As far as earnings surprises are concerned, Marathon Oil – whose business is organized into North America and International segments – has an excellent history, having gone past the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four reports. However, with an Earnings ESP of -7.14% and a Zacks Rank #4, our proven model shows that an earnings beat is unlikely for Marathon Oil in the upcoming quarterly release.

(CXO  -  Free Report) reporting second-quarter 2017 results. Coming to the earnings surprise history, this Midland, TX-headquartered energy explorer – with producing properties mainly in the Permian Basin of southeast New Mexico and west Texas – has been on a bull run: it went past estimates in all the last four quarters, resulting in an average positive surprise of 247.57%.Powered with the right combination of two key ingredients – an Earnings ESP of +2.33% and Zacks Rank #3 – our proven model shows that an earnings beat is likely for Concho Resources in the to-be-reported quarter as well.Concho Resources Inc.

Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

383,OXY,"Shares of Occidental Petroleum Corporation (OXY  -  Free Report) have outperformed the Zacks Domestic Integrated Oil and Gas industry in the last six months. While the company’s shares rallied 10.8%, the industry gained 5.9%.Occidental Petroleum continues to benefit from increasing oil production in the Permian Resources and from its focus on high margin production region. Improving operating efficiency is also lowering barrels of oil equivalent (boe) operating expenses of the company in Permian Resources region. Year to date, operating expenses per boe is $8.14, down from $12.93 per boe in 2016, reflecting an improvement of 37%.Capital expenditures in the first nine months of 2017 were $2.4 billion compared with $1.8 billion in the last-year period. Year to date, the company has invested nearly $2 billion in its Oil & Gas segment, which boosted its performance. Occidental Petroleum expects to increase its capital expenditure to $1.1 billion for the fourth quarter, taking its 2017 spending to nearly $3.6 billion.Occidental Petroleum is also gaining from improving contribution from Chemical segment, primarily due to improving pricing and operations. The company will generate additional cash flow from the Chemical segment in 2018, thanks to the startup of the 4CPe plant in the fourth quarter of this year and from improving product prices.The company’s operation is subject to natural calamities and disasters. Occidental Petroleum had to temporarily shut its chlorovinyl production, primarily due to impact of Hurricane Harvey, which lowered its pre-tax income by nearly $60 million in the third quarter. Harvey also lowered the company’s Permian Resources production by 1,000 boe/d in the third quarter.The company’s Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 and 2018 earnings per share moved up 18.5% and 10.2%, respectively in last 90 days. The company delivered positive surprises in last three quarters with an average surprise of 31.9%.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderThe stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

384,OXY,"It was a week where the price of oil spiked to its highest mark in more than two years and natural gas futures rose marginally.On the news front, integrated major Royal Dutch Shell plc (RDS.A  -  Free Report), as well as Permian-focused upstream oil and gas explorers –  EOG Resources Inc. (EOG  -  Free Report) and Concho Resources Inc. (CXO  -  Free Report) – came up with stronger-than-expected earnings reports, driven by higher commodity prices.Overall, it was a good week for the sector. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures gained about 3.2% to close at $55.64 per barrel, while natural gas prices edged up 0.7% to $2.984 per million Btu (MMBtu). (See the last ‘Oil & Gas Stock Roundup’ here: Exxon, Chevron, TOTAL Report Strong Q3.)The U.S. oil benchmark rallied to its highest settlement since July 2015 on expectations that OPEC and other major producers will agree to expand their output-cut deal beyond March. The agreement, already renewed once, keeps 1.8 million barrels a day off the market in an attempt to clear a supply glut.Further support came from the U.S. Energy Department's inventory release, which showed steep declines in domestic gasoline and distillate inventories, apart from a bigger-than-expected fall in domestic crude supplies.Upbeat U.S. economic data sets and signs of recovery in global demand growth was also bullish for oil prices.Meanwhile, natural gas futures logged a small gain following an in-line increase in supplies. Favorable weather forecasts and strength in the commodity’s demand provided further upside.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    Europe’s largest oil company Royal Dutch Shell reported strong third-quarter results on all round contribution from all its segments. In particular, rebounding commodity prices and cost cuts helped the Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company come out with better-than-expected numbers. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.During the quarter under review, Shell generated cash flow from operations of $7,582 million, returned $4,000 million to shareholders through dividends and spent $5,742 million on capital projects. Despite falling from the year-ago period, the company’s resilient cash generation has helped it to cover dividend payments. Importantly, the group raked in $3,670 million in free cash flow during the third quarter, up from $3,324 million a year ago.As of Sep 30, 2017, the company had $20,699 million in cash and $88,356 million in debt (including short-term debt). Net debt-to-capitalization ratio was approximately 25.4%, down from 29.2% a year ago following the BG Group acquisition. The improvement in the group’s debt ratio was helped by cost cuts and asset sales (worth more than $26 billion since 2016). (Read more: Shell's Q3 Earnings Beat Amid Higher Oil, Cost Cuts.)2.    Upstream energy company EOG Resources reported third-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of 19 cents, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 10 cents supported by higher oil equivalent production and increased commodity price realizations. The bottom line also compared favorably with the year-ago quarter loss of 40 cents per share.In the quarter, EOG Resources’ total volume improved 7.6% year over year to 55 million barrels of oil equivalent (MMBoe). Average price realization for crude oil and condensates rose 10.3% year over year to $48.11 a barrel. Quarterly NGL prices also improved 50% year over year from $14.92 to $22.38 per barrel. Natural gas was sold at $2.19 per thousand cubic feet (Mcf), up 12.3% year over year.The company expects crude oil equivalent volumes in the fourth quarter of 2017 to be in the range of 328.1-662.2 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day. Capital expenditure for the fourth quarter is expected to lie within $3,000-$3,350 million.Along with the strong results, the company announced that it has added two premium crude acreages to its portfolio with net resource potential of 750 million barrels of oil equivalent. (Read more EOG Resources Q3 Earnings Gain on Increased Volumes.)3.    Permian-focused energy explorer Concho Resourcesreported strong third-quarter revenues and earnings results on the back of higher commodity price realizations and robust production growth.Concho Resources' average quarterly volume increased 26% year over year to 193.2 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (exceeding the high end of the company’s guidance range), of which 62% was liquids. Daily oil output was up 31% to 119.6 thousand barrels, while natural gas production came in at 441.6 million cubic feet (up 19%).The average realized natural gas price jumped 31% from the year-ago quarter to $3.18 per thousand cubic feet, while average oil price realization increased 9.1% to $45.29 per barrel. Overall, the company fetched $35.29 per barrel as against $30.61 a year back.The company expects production growth above the high end of its annual guidance range of 24-26%, with oil output growth expected to exceed 27%. The company has provided fourth quarter net production guidance of 200-204 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day. Capital expenditures for 2017 are estimated to be between $1,600 million and $1,800 million. (Read more Concho Resources Tops Q3 Earnings & Sales Estimates)4.    U.S. energy firm Apache Corp. (APA  -  Free Report) reported third-quarter earnings per share – excluding one-time items – of 4 cents, versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate for a loss of 5 cents. The bottom line also turned around from the year-ago adjusted loss of 3 cents. The outperformance stems from higher oil and gas realizations, and lower cost.The average realized crude oil price during the third quarter was $49.34 per barrel, representing an increase of 11.3% from the year-ago realization of $44.35. Moreover, the average realized natural gas price during the September quarter of 2017 was $2.75 per thousand cubic feet (Mcf), up 6.2% from the year-ago period.Apache’s third quarter lease operating expenses totaled $358 million, down 6.3% from the year-ago quarter. Moreover, total costs and expenses fell 36.7% from the third quarter of 2016 to $1,482 million.During the oil rout, Apache aligned its spending plans with the low-price environment. But Apache is now looking to increase its capital investment after achieving cost rationalization. Keeping with the company’s planned shift in strategic objective, Apache’s oil and gas capital investments totaled $843 million during the July-September period, 95.1% higher than the $432 million incurred a year ago. (Read more Apache Posts Q3 Earnings on Oil Rebound, Cost Cuts)5.    Chinese oil and gas giant PetroChina Company Limited (PTR  -  Free Report) announced third-quarter 2017 earnings of RMB 4,690 million or RMB 0.03 per diluted share, compared with RMB 1,200 million or RMB 0.01 per diluted share a year earlier. The positive comparisons can be primarily attributable to higher oil prices and strict cost control, which helped its biggest unit — exploration and production — to swing to profitability.Average realized crude oil price during the first nine months of 2017 was $48.76 per barrel, representing a 36.2% jump from the year-ago period. Further, natural gas price rose 8.6% year-over-year to $5.07 per thousand cubic feet (Mcf). This helped PetroChina’s upstream (or exploration & production) achieve an operating income of RMB 10,983 million — turning around from the year-ago operating loss of RMB 3,949 million. A tight leash on oil and gas lifting costs that decreased 1.9% from the same period last year, also helped results.As of Sep 30, 2017, PetroChina’s cash balance was RMB 169,469 million, while net cash flow from operating activities was RMB 244,295 million for the first three quarters of this year. Capital expenditure for the period was RMB 124,552 million, 9.1% higher than the year-ago level.

386,OXY,"Occidental Petroleum Corporation (OXY  -  Free Report) will release third-quarter 2017 financial results after the market closes on Nov 1. In second quarter, the oil and gas company reported a positive earnings surprise of 25%. Let’s see how things are shaping up at the company prior to this announcement.Factors to ConsiderOccidental Petroleum expects one-time impact of Hurricane Harvey on its performance.  Due to the hurricane, third-quarter pre-tax income is expected to be down $70 million while Permian Resources daily production is likely to reduce nearly 1,000 barrels of oil equivalent (boe) per day. Occidental Petroleum initially expected Permian volumes to be in the range between 138,000 and 143,000 boe/d.  Per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, average daily production is expected to be 607,000 boe/d, reflecting year-over-year and sequential growth of 0.3% and 1%, respectively. This is within Occidental Petroleum’s expectation of 600,000 to 610,000. Domestic production is the major contributor to the company’s daily production volumes which was impacted by the outages caused by the hurricane.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues and earnings for the quarter stand at $3,146 million and 11 cents, respectively, reflecting a sequential decline of 12.7% and 26.7%.Occidental Petroleum Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Occidental Petroleum Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Occidental Petroleum Corporation QuoteEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not show that Occidental Petroleum is likely to beat estimates this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Occidental Petroleum has an Earnings ESP of -1.14%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Though Occidental Petroleum’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of the ESP, its negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to Consider                    Occidental Petroleum does not have the right parameters to come out with earning surprise this season. However, we have a few players in the Zacks Oil and Energy Sector, which have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Cheniere Energy, Inc. (LNG  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +2,500.00% and a Zacks Rank #3. It is expected to report third-quarter 2017 earnings on Nov 14.
