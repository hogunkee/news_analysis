0,BHGE,"Shares of U.S. industrial giant General Electric (GE  -  Free Report), Thomas Edison’s old company, are trading up higher than 6.5% in today’s pre-market on new headlines that the long-beleaguered firm will be spinning off its healthcare business and exiting its position on oil & gas company Baker Hughes (BHGE  -  Free Report) over the next 2-3 years, reducing its considerable debt by $25 billion in the process. This comes on the very day GE is being replaced by Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA  -  Free Report) on the 30-company blue-chip index.Since he was appointed to take the reins of GE last August, CEO John Flannery has acknowledged the difficulties he had inherited and that he will be focused on turning its core businesses around. Since then, and despite GE stock having gone south by roughly 50% year over year, it would appear he has stayed true to his word. The company focus will now be in the realms of Power (with a particular interest in renewable energy such as wind turbines) and Aviation.

2,BHGE,"In its weekly release, Baker Hughes (BHGE  -  Free Report), a GE company, reported a decline in rig count in the United States.About the Rig CountBaker Hughes’ data, issued at the end of every week since 1944, helps energy service providers gauge the overall business environment of the oil and gas industry.A change in the Houston-based oilfield services player’s rotary rig count impacts demand for energy services like drilling, completion and production provided by the likes of Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report), Schlumberger Limited (SLB  -  Free Report), Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO  -  Free Report) and Transocean Ltd. (RIG  -  Free Report).DetailsWeekly Summary: Rigs engaged in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas in the United States totaled 1052 in the week ended Jun 22, down from 1059 in the previous week. This marked the decline in rig count for two weeks in a row.  Despite rig count slipping to an all-time low of 404 in May 2016, it has been rising rapidly in U.S. shale resources. The current national rig count is considerably higher than the prior-year level of 941.For the week under review, the fall in rig count can be attributed to lower onshore and offshore operations. The number of onshore rigs totaled 1032, down from 1035. Moreover, the tally for offshore rigs was recorded at 18, down from the prior week’s tally of 20. Also, the number of rigs operating in the inland waters was two last week, lower than four for the week ended Jun 15.  Oil Rig Count: Oil rig count was 862, down from 863 for the week ended Jun 15. However, the current tally, though far from the peak of 1,609 attained in October 2014, is significantly higher than last year’s 758.Natural Gas Rig Count: The natural gas rig count of 188 lags 194 for the week ended Jun 15. Per the recent report, the number of natural gas-directed rigs is 88.3%, below the all-time high of 1,606 in 2008.  However, like oil, the count of rigs exploring gas is above the year-ago tally of 183.Rig Count by Type: The number of vertical drilling rigs totaled 60 units, in line with the prior week tally. The horizontal/directional rig count (encompassing new drilling technology that has the ability to drill and extract gas from dense rock formations, also known as shale formations) fell by seven units to 992.  Gulf of Mexico (GoM): The GoM rig count is 18 units, of which 15 were oil-directed. The count fell from the tally of 19 for the week ended Jun 15.ConclusionThe number of rigs exploring in the United States declined primarily due to the removal of two oil rigs in the Permian Basin and one from the Williston Basin. The removal of one natural gas rig from each of Haynesville and Marcellus shale plays also led to the fall in rig count.West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude is again approaching the $70-a-barrel psychological mark. Although the pricing scenario of oil is favorable for drillers, the production possibilities in the domestic shale plays — especially the Permian — remain dull owing to the pipeline bottleneck problem. In other words, the bottleneck in transportation capacity and labor shortage have made Permian operations expensive.Despite the unfavorable business scenario, investors may bet on a few oil and gas explorers. However, picking winning stocks may be a daunting task.This is where our VGM Score comes in handy. Here, V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum, and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores. Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners. However, it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM Score.We have narrowed down our search to the following two stocks – Northern Oil and Gas, Inc. (NOG  -  Free Report) and Whiting Petroleum Corporation (WLL  -  Free Report). The stocks carry a VGM Score of A or B and sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Northern Oil and Gas — with a VGM Score of A — is projected to post earnings growth of 157.1% in 2018.Whiting Petroleum, with a VGM Score of B, has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all of the last four quarters.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!

3,BHGE,"Equinor ASA (EQNR  -  Free Report) is awarding new contracts for integrated drilling and well services on majority of the Equinor-operated fields on the Norwegian continental shelf (NCS) to Baker Hughes Incorporated (BHGE  -  Free Report), Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report) and Schlumberger Limited (SLB  -  Free Report).The contracts comprise options for five two-year extensions. The extension of the contracts is dependent on constant accomplishment of the goals for well deliveries. Initially, the contracts have been awarded for four years and have a total estimated value of about NOK 30 billion.Equinor’s new contracts will ensure that the service supplier, rig supplier and operator have proper interactions with each other so as to simplify each ones roles and responsibilities.The purpose of this practice is to facilitate flawless planning and execution of operations between various contributors. It will also help in drilling more wells, which will result in recovery improvement and enhance long-term operations.The new contracts are projected to generate employment for about 2000 people on 17 fixed platforms and eight mobile rigs. The current service contracts, which expire on Aug 31, 2018, will be substituted with the new ones.The contracts incorporate new methods of joint operations, which will provide the service suppliers with larger accountability for services than before. For successful implementation of integrated operations, support from land will be vital. For mobile units the service contracts will be connected to the rig rather than various licenses. The collaboration model has given very competent and efficient results. It has already been tested out for Johan Sverdrup Phase 1, Aasta Hansteen, Mariner and the Askeladd and Askepott Cat J rigs.The contracts will comprise integrated drilling, cementation and pumping, drilling and completion fluids, electrical logging and completion services for well construction.Per Baker Hughes, it will be the key drilling and well services provider for the eight rigs developing Troll, Oseberg and Grane. These three fields are considered to be the most prolific and dynamic in the Norwegian continental shelf.In a separate announcement, Equinor announced that it had been awarded seven licenses in the 24th licensing round by the Ministry of Petroleum and Energy. Of which, Equinor will operate five and will have partner positions in the other two.The company aims to maintain production on the NCS until 2030 and beyond at the current level. For this, the company is required to get access to new exploration acreage past the already-opened areas.Thus, the award is in line with Equinor’s exploration strategy of securing access to newer areas on the Norwegian continental shelf as exploration in the region gets more challenging.Price PerformanceIn the past three months, Equinor’s shares have gained 16.8% compared with the industry’s 8.6% rise.Zacks Rank Equinor currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

Notably, total count increased 13 times in the last 14 weeks.Since it slipped to an all-time low of 404 in May 2016, rig count has been rising rapidly in U.S. shale resources. Punctuated by a few pauses, the current nationwide rig count is considerably higher than the prior-year level of 927.For the week in discussion, the rise in rig count can be attributed to higher offshore and inland waters operations. The number of offshore rigs totaled 20, marginally higher than 19. Three rigs operated in the inland waters last week, higher than two for the week ended Jun 1. The tally for onshore rigs was 1039, in line with prior week.Oil Rig Count: Oil rig count was 862, up from 861 for the week ended Jun 1. Moreover, the current tally, though far from the peak of 1,609 attained in October 2014, is significantly higher than last year’s 741.

In the past six weeks, the number of oil rigs in the Permian Basin increased five times. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude continues to hover around $65-a-barrel psychological mark. This seems favorable for drillers in few U.S. shale plays like Eagle Ford despite the fact that producers are facing labor shortage and low pipeline capacity, especially in the Permian.Two energy stocks that should make valuable additions to your portfolio are Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (APC  -  Free Report) and WildHorse Resource Development Corporation (WRD  -  Free Report).

7,BHGE,"Stocks ended lower on May 25 as crude prices plummeted. The immediate trigger for a decline in oil prices was reports that OPEC and Russia were discussing an increase in oil production. Consequently, stocks of energy companies suffered losses.The energy sector has been on a dream run this year following OPEC and other major oil producers’ decision to extend an output controls agreement. Consequently, oil prices touched three-year highs recently. But could a reconsideration of the same agreement end crude’s spectacular rally? Oil Prices Suffer Weekly LossesOn May 25, the price of WTI crude declined by 4% or $2.83 to end at $67.88 per barrel. This was the largest daily loss for U.S. crude price since July 2017. Currently, oil is nearly 7% lower than the recent highs above $72. This was also its lowest close since May 1. Further, prices suffered a weekly decline of 4.9%.Additionally, Brent crude lost 3% or $2.35 to close at $76.44 per barrel. This was its lowest close since May 8. Brent crude also suffered a weekly loss of 2.6%. In recent weeks, a collapse in production in Venezuela and fears that exports from Iran will fall post Trump’s decision to exit the nuclear deal had boosted prices.Reports of Output Increase Cause DeclineThe decline in crude prices weighed on shares of energy companies. Consequently, shares of oil majors Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM  -  Free Report) and Chevron Corporation (CVX  -  Free Report) declined 1.9% and 3.5%, respectively.Shares of Schlumberger Limited (SLB  -  Free Report) and ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report) Inc. also declined 3.7% and 4.4%, respectively. ConocoPhillips has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The immediate trigger for the decline in crude prices was reports that OPEC and key non-OPEC oil producers were considering an increase in output. On May 25, Russia’s energy minister Alexander Novak met his Saudi counterpart Khalid Al-Falih in Petersburg to discuss the output controls agreement.Subsequently, reports emerged that an increase in production levels was being considered for the first time since 2016. The current agreement, which has been in force since January 2017, aims to limit output to 1.8 million barrels a day.According to a report from Reuters, the planned increase in output is as high as 1 million barrels. Bloomberg has reported that output may be increased by 300,000 barrels to 800,000 barrels per day. Currently, global inventories are close to OPEC’s targeted level, another factor which has helped to boost prices to three-year highs recently.Forecasts for Prices Remain HighAnother reason for the decline in crude prices on last Friday was an increase in total active U.S. rig count. A report from Baker Hughes (BHGE  -  Free Report) revealed that the number of active U.S. rigs drilling for oil increased by 15 to 859 over last week. This was the biggest weekly increase since the week ended February 9.However, despite the losses incurred on Friday Société Générale (SCGLY  -  Free Report) revised its projections for oil prices upward. The bank now believes Brent crude will maintain an average of $72.75 in 2019, $7.75 higher than its earlier forecast. The outlook for WTI was also revised upward by $6.75 to $67.75.The primary reason for analysts’ projections for a continuing uptrend is the massive decline in Venezuelan output. Analysts at the Paris-based bank now believe that monthly declines will continue at the current rate into 2019. The projected fall in crude supplies due to the United States’ decision to exit the Iran nuclear deal is also likely to boost prices in the medium term. 5 Medical Stocks to Buy NowZacks names 5 companies poised to ride a medical breakthrough that is targeting cures for leukemia, AIDS, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, and other conditions.New products in this field are already generating substantial revenue and even more wondrous treatments are in the pipeline.

Notably, total count increased 11 times in the last 12 weeks.Since it slipped to an all-time low of 404 in May 2016, rig count has been rising rapidly in U.S. shale resources. Punctuated by a few pauses, the current nationwide rig count is considerably higher than the prior-year level of 901.For the week in discussion, the rise in rig count can be attributed to higher onshore operations. The number of onshore rigs totaled 1023, marginally higher than 1021. Four rigs operated in the inland waters last week, higher than three for the week ended May 11. The tally for offshore rigs was, however, recorded at 19 compared with 21.Oil Rig Count: Oil rig count was 844, flat with the week ended May 11. Moreover, the current tally, though far from the peak of 1,609 attained in October 2014, is significantly higher than last year’s 720. The oil rig count rose nine times in the last 12 weeks.Natural Gas Rig Count: The natural gas rig count of 200 is higher than 199 for the week ended May 11.Moreover, like oil, the count of rigs exploring gas is above the year-ago tally of 180.Per the recent report, the number of natural gas-directed rigs is 88%, below the all-time high of 1,606 achieved in late summer 2008.Rig Count by Type: The number of vertical drilling rigs of 61 units increased from 55 units. However, the horizontal/directional rig count (encompassing new drilling technology that has the ability to drill and extract gas from dense rock formations, also known as shale formations) fell by five units to 985 units.   Gulf of Mexico (GoM): The GoM rig count is at 18 units — 17 rigs were oil-directed — lower than the tally of 20 for the week ended May 11.ConclusionThe number of total rigs exploring in the United States has increased, courtesy of the addition of three land rigs in New Mexico and two in Texas.           West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude continues to trade above the $70-a-barrel psychological mark owing to concerns that Iran’s crude export might fall after Trump nixed the nuclear deal.

9,BHGE,"West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude continues to trade above the $70-a-barrel psychological mark in the wake of concerns that Iran’s crude export might fall after Trump nixed the nuclear deal.Higher oil prices are definitely a plus for all drillers in major U.S shale plays. Investors interested in the energy sector should know which oil plays are profitable at the moment.The Permian Basin has long been the favorite oil and gas play for drillers, as the region supported companies even when oil was trading below $50, per media reports. At such a low price level, most explorers struggled to survive in areas like Eagle Ford and instead chose to focus on the Permian Basin by dumping assets in other plays.However, the situation is quite different now with Eagle Ford taking center stage following the bottleneck in the Permian pipeline.Strong Permian OperationsThe Permian region has always been in the spotlight when it comes to oil and natural gas production in the United States. In terms of production, Permian has outrun resources like Anadarko, Appalachia, Bakken, Eagle Ford, Haynesville and Niobrara.As per data provided by the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), oil production from Permian has been increasing steadily over the past several years. Notably, the maximum proportion of crude production in the United States came from Permian.From nearly 1 million barrels a day of crude at the beginning of 2009, Permian’s daily production is now heading toward 3.5 million barrels, per the EIA. While the prolific Permian Basin is undoubtedly the hottest shale play in the United States, Eagle Ford and Bakken are the other regions that have contributed meaningfully to the overall production picture.After a steep fall in rig count in the mid-2014 to mid-2016 period due to crude weakness, the number of rigs exploring oil has started to increase. We can say that the rise in drilling activities has been directly contributing to Permian production.Rising Activities in Eagle Ford From minimal production since the start of 2009, daily production of oil in the Eagle Ford region is now headed toward 1.5 million barrels, per the EIA. This has been supported by an uptick in rig count in the shale play.The weekly rig count in Eagle Ford was mostly in the range of 188 to 214, per data provided by Baker Hughes (BHGE  -  Free Report), a GE company. The count fell to below 30 in mid-2016 and is now treading toward 70, reflecting increasing focus on the shale play.Notably, daily crude production in the Eagle Ford saw upward momentum since early 2011, approaching toward 1.8-million barrels per day. However, production started falling since 2015-beginning as energy market was already grappled with crude weaknesses.Focus Now on Eagle FordEIA predicts new well oil production per rig from Eagle Ford to increase from 1,479 barrels a day in May to 1,532 barrels in June this year. Meanwhile, in the Permian, EIA expects the production growth to be only 2 barrels per day.This seems that drillers and explorers are redirecting focus from the crowded Permian to Eagle Ford. In Permian, there is a dearth of pipeline capacity for transporting oil to Gulf Coast export facilities, major refinery terminals and principal hubs like Cushing. This has forced Midland operators to sell stranded oil at a big discount to that in Cushing.Drillers with strong foresight have already booked the existing pipeline capacity for transporting Permian crude to the principal hubs. Thus, other drillers do not have the incentive to operate in the basin.Also, labor shortage and low pipeline capacity have bumped up the cost of production in the Permian Basin, making the operating scenario unfavorable for new drillers. Hence, upstream players have shifted focus to the Eagle Ford, where the cost of production is relatively low.Eagle Ford Drillers Come to the ForefrontHeadquartered in Houston, TX, ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report) is giving more importance to the Eagle Ford shale play than the crowded Permian Basin, per Ryan Lance, CEO of the upstream energy giant.The company’s prime focus on the Eagle Ford is reflected in the first-quarter 2018 production picture. Through the quarter, the company’s daily oil equivalent production from the Permian Basin was recorded at 19,000 barrels, considerably lower than 163,000 barrels from Eagle Ford. (Read more: ConocoPhillips Chooses Eagle Ford Over Permian: Here's Why).EOG Resources, Inc. (EOG  -  Free Report) is among the leading players in the Bakken play and the largest in the Eagle Ford. In the South Texas Eagle Ford, the company has brought online 72 gross wells through first-quarter 2018. The company’s strong first quarter production was significantly aided by operations in Eagle Ford.Houston, TX-based Marathon Oil Corporation (MRO  -  Free Report) has extensive acres of resources in the oil-rich Eagle Ford. The company’s year-over-year rise in production, available for sale, in the first-quarter 2018 was aided by solid contributions from U.S. resource plays in the Eagle Ford.Chesapeake Energy Corporation (CHK  -  Free Report), headquartered in Oklahoma City, OK, has a footprint across roughly 245,000 acres in the lucrative Eagle Ford. Through 2018, the company plans to bring online up to 140 wells in the Eagle Ford.We advise investors not to dump the above stocks right away as the companies currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

12,BHGE,"We have now passed the halfway mark of the first-quarter reporting cycle. We expect the elite S&P 500 index to record year-over-year earnings growth of 22.6% in the quarter on 8.4% higher revenues.Energy to OutperformAmong all the 16 Zacks sectors that represent the S&P 500 cohort, we expect Energy to outperform and be a key driver of the index’s Q1 earnings growth. In fact, excluding Energy, earnings growth for the index is expected to drop to 21% from 22.6%. We expect Energy to report year-over-year earnings growth of 70.8% on 15.4% higher revenues. The healthy crude price scenario has primarily backed Energy’s performance.The average West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude price for the month of January, February and March was $63.70, $62.23, and $62.73 per barrel, respectively — per the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Notably, the average monthly price of the commodity never touched $60 in the 2015-2017 period, courtesy of the extension of OPEC’s production cut deal through 2018-end.What Role Does Crude Price Play?The fate of all energy companies mostly depends on the movement of crude price. Explorers and producers of the commodity primarily benefit from an uptick in oil prices. Also, the market saw a ramp up in drilling activities by rigs in oil plays of the United States.According to Baker Hughes, a GE company (BHGE  -  Free Report), the number of rigs explored for oil resources in the domestic market increased from 742 (for the week through Jan 5, 2018) to 797 (for the week ended Mar 29, 2018). Baker Hughes’ data, issued at the end of every week since 1944, helps energy service providers gauge the overall business environment of the oil and gas industry.The increased drilling activities have also supported higher production of the commodity. For the first two months of 2018, the production of oil in the domestic field was recorded at 310,138 thousand barrels and 287,379 thousand barrels, respectively — marking a year-over-year improvement from 273,673 thousand barrels and 253,623 thousand barrels.Higher production will likely be favorable for midstream energy players for transporting and storing the commodity.Let’s See How EOG, CNQ, PBA & PE Are PlacedLet’s take a look at four Energy stocks scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 earnings on May 3 and see how things are shaping up for the upcoming results.Headquartered in Houston, TX, EOG Resources, Inc. (EOG  -  Free Report) posted an average positive earnings surprise of 25.7% for the last four quarters.Our proven model shows that EOG Resources is likely to beat estimates this earnings season. Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is +3.33%. The upstream energy player carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which when combined with a positive ESP, makes us confident of a positive earnings surprise. This is because our research shows that for stocks with a combination of a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 and a positive Earnings ESP, the chance of a positive earnings surprise is as high as 70%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Canadian Natural Resources Limited (CNQ  -  Free Report) sports a Zacks Rank #1 and an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. Hence, our proven model does not conclusively show a beat for Canadian Natural.Headquartered in Calgary, Canada, Pembina Pipeline Corporation (PBA  -  Free Report) posted average positive earnings surprise of 2.9% for the last four quarters.

13,BHGE,"Oilfield services behemoth Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report) reported in-line first quarter profit after robust North American drilling activity on the back of oil pricing strength were offset by problems in Venezuela and frack sand delivery delays.The world's second-largest oilfield services company after Schlumberger’s (SLB  -  Free Report) income from continuing operations (adjusted for Venezuela write-downs) came in at 41 cents per share, same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Moreover, revenues of $5,740 million missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5,760 million.However, Halliburton joined fellow oil services majors Schlumberger and Baker Hughes, a GE Company (BHGE  -  Free Report), in affirming increased activity in U.S. shale, driven by strong oil and gas production in response to an improving crude environment.Halliburton Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Halliburton Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Halliburton Company QuoteSegmental PerformanceOperating income from the Completion and Production segment was $500 million, significantly higher than the year-ago level of $147 million. The division’s performance was helped by continued growth in the North American land drilling business. Further, Halliburton experienced a bump in the Europe/Africa/CIS completion services, while stimulation activity in the Middle East were higher as well.However, the segment operating income could not match our consensus estimate of $534 million. The shortfall could be attributed to cost inflation triggered by increased fracking sand pricing. Rising prices of sand – used to hydraulically fracture new wells – increased the expense associated with the drilling of a new shale well and put upward pressure on the cost of contractors like Halliburton.As it is, Halliburton had to shell out more to purchase the sand from spot markets to minimize the impact on client completion timelines after extreme weather and rail shut-downs disrupted deliveries.Meanwhile, Drilling and Evaluation unit profit improved from $122 million in the first quarter of 2017 to $188 million this year. The outperformance was on account of higher drilling activity in the Eastern Hemisphere and North America.But the segment income was below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $180 million. Results were hampered by lower activity – primarily across various product lines – in Latin America, especially Venezuela.Balance SheetHalliburton’s capital expenditure in the first quarter was $501 million. As of Mar 31, 2018, the company had approximately $2,332 million in cash/cash equivalents and $10,428 million in long-term debt, representing a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 55.4%.Zacks Rank & Stock PicksHalliburton currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), implying that it is expected to perform in line with the broader U.S. equity market over the next one to three months.Meanwhile, one can look at a better-ranked oilfield service player like Flotek Industries, Inc. (FTK  -  Free Report). Flotek Industries is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock.(You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.)Flotek Industries provides a range of products and services to enhance returns for the oil and gas finders. The 2018 Zacks Consensus Estimate for this Houston, TX-based company is 32 cents, representing some 557.1% earnings per share growth over 2017. Next year’s average forecast is $52 cents, pointing to another 62.5% growth.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

15,BHGE,"So far in Q1 earnings, 10.4% of the S&P 500 companies have reported results. The total 52 companies belonging to the index saw year-over-year earnings growth of 27.9% on 10.7% higher revenues. Notably, 84.6% of the firms surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings while 78.8% beat the revenue mark.As of now, we have seen only one S&P 500 release from the Energy space — Kinder Morgan, Inc. (KMI  -  Free Report).Energy Sector Likely to Shine BrightFor the first-quarter of 2018, we expect Energy to eclipse all the 16 Zacks sectors, posting earnings growth of 58.6%. For the January-to-March quarter, we project earnings of $14 billion — the highest in the last four quarters.  Importantly, Energy will likely be among the major drivers behind the S&P 500’s year-over-year earnings growth. Excluding Energy, the index’s Q1 earnings growth will likely drop to 16.5% from 17.8%. A favorable Q1 oil pricing scenario is expected to back Energy’s performance. Per the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the average West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude price for the month of January, February and March was reported at $63.70 per barrel, $62.23 and $62.73, respectively. The average oil price never touched $60 in any of the months in the 2015-2017 period, thanks to the extension of OPEC’s production cut deal through 2018-end.Let’s See How SLB & BHGE ere PlacedBoth Schlumberger Limited (SLB  -  Free Report) and Baker Hughes (BHGE  -  Free Report) belong to the Zacks Oil & Gas-Field Services industry, which falls under the Energy sector as well. Both stocks are scheduled to report on April 20, before the opening bell.Let’s employ a few parameters to analyze how the stocks will fare earnings season.Earnings ESP & HistoryEarnings ESP is our proprietary methodology for identifying stocks that have a high chance of surprising in their upcoming earnings announcement. It shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Our research shows that stocks with a combination of a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP, the chance of a positive earnings surprise is as high as 70%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Schlumberger will beat estimates this quarter. This is because the stock has an Earnings ESP of -1.72% and a Zacks Rank #3. Though a Zacks Rank of 3 increases the predictive power of ESP, a negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Baker Hughes is unlikely to beat estimates, since it has a combination of a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and Earnings ESP of -2.94%. This is because we caution against Sell-rated stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Strong Sell) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Schlumberger’s earnings surprise history is impressive. The stock surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the last four quarters, the average positive earnings surprise being 6.4%.The picture is just the reverse for Baker Hughes, with the stock failing to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the past four quarters. The average negative earnings surprise for the last four quarters is recorded at 34.8%.Earnings GrowthWe expect Schlumberger to witness earnings growth of 52% for Q1 2018. Baker Hughes’ projected growth of 250% is much healthier.Price PerformanceSchlumberger stock fell 3.9% during the January-March quarter of 2018, performing better than the respective decline of 7.7% and 12.2% of the industry and Baker Hughes.Bottom LineThe healthy oil pricing scenario is favorable for both the stocks, as oilfield services players are expected to clinch more contracts for setting up oil wells.Although Baker Hughes scores way higher in terms of earnings growth, the stock is unlikely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Meanwhile, Schlumberger has higher chances of trumping estimates.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of All Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce """"the world's first trillionaires,"""" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

16,BHGE,"In its weekly release, Baker Hughes (BHGE  -  Free Report), a GE company, reported an increase in total rig count in the United States.About the Rig CountBaker Hughes’ data, issued at the end of every week since 1944, helps energy service providers gauge the overall business environment of the oil and gas industry.Change in this Houston-based oilfield services player’s rotary rig count impacts demand for energy services like drilling, completion and production provided by the likes of Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report), Schlumberger Limited (SLB  -  Free Report), Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO  -  Free Report) and Transocean Ltd. (RIG  -  Free Report).DetailsWeekly Summary: Rigs engaged in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas in the United States totaled 1008 in the week (ended Apr 13) compared with the prior week’s 1003. Notably, total count increased eight times in the last 10 weeks.Since it slipped to an all-time low of 404 in May 2016, rig count has been rising rapidly in U.S. shale resources. Punctuated by a few pauses, the current nationwide rig count is considerably higher than the prior-year level of 847.For the week in discussion, the rise in rig count can be attributed to higher offshore and onshore operations. The tally for offshore rigs was recorded at 16 compared with 12. Also, the number of onshore rigs totaled 988, marginally higher than 987.Four rigs operated in the inland waters last week, in line with the figure reported in the week ended Apr 6.Oil Rig Count: Oil rig count rose to 815 from 808 for the week ended Apr 6. Moreover, the current tally, though far from the peak of 1,609 attained in October 2014, is significantly higher than last year’s 683. The oil rig count rose eight times in the last 10 weeks.Natural Gas Rig Count: The natural gas rig count of 192 is lower than 194 for the week ended Apr 6.However, like oil, the count of rigs exploring gas is above the year-ago tally of 162.Per the recent report, the number of natural gas-directed rigs is 88% below the all-time high of 1,606 achieved in late summer 2008.Rig Count by Type: The number of vertical drilling rigs of 55 units dropped from 56 units. However, the horizontal/directional rig count (encompassing new drilling technology that has the ability to drill and extract gas from dense rock formations, also known as shale formations) rose by six units to 953 units.Gulf of Mexico (GoM): The GoM rig count is at 16 units — 15 rigs were oil-directed — higher than the tally of 12 for the week ended Apr 6.ConclusionThe number of total rigs exploring in the United States has increased, courtesy of the addition of two oil rigs in Cana Woodford shale play and three oil rigs in the Eagle Ford.The price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude is trading above $65 per-barrel-mark, thanks to the intensified middle east tensions. The missile strike in Syria by the United States and allies Britain and France will likely pave the way for America’s strong stance against Iran and Russia. Iran and Russia reportedly backed Syria for conducting the suspected chemical attack on Douma people. Hence, there is considerable room for rally in oil prices which could support the persistent ramp up of drilling activities.Two energy stocks that should make valuable additions to your portfolio are Continental Resources, Inc.

17,BHGE,"In its weekly release, Baker Hughes (BHGE  -  Free Report), a GE company, reported an increase in total rig count in the United States.About the Rig CountBaker Hughes’ data, issued at the end of every week since 1944, helps energy service providers gauge the overall business environment of the oil and gas industry.Change in this Houston-based oilfield services player’s rotary rig count impacts demand for energy services like drilling, completion and production provided by the likes of Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report), Schlumberger Limited (SLB  -  Free Report), Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO  -  Free Report) and Transocean Ltd. (RIG  -  Free Report).DetailsWeekly Summary: Rigs engaged in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas in the United States totaled 1003 in the week (ended Apr 6) — higher than the prior week’s 993. Notably, total count increased six times in the last seven weeks.Since it slipped to an all-time low of 404 in May 2016, rig count has been rising rapidly in U.S. shale resources. Punctuated by a few pauses, the current nationwide rig count is considerably higher than the prior-year level of 839.For the week in discussion, the rise in rig count can be attributed to higher onshore operations. The number of onshore rigs totaled 987, higher than 977.Four rigs operated in the inland waters last week, in line with the week ended Mar 29. The tally for offshore rigs was flat at 12.Oil Rig Count: Oil rig count rose to 808 from 797 for the week ended Mar 29. The count of rigs exploring oil in the United States never reached the current mark since March 2015. Moreover, the current tally, though far from the peak of 1,609 attained in October 2014, is significantly higher than last year’s 672. The oil rig count rose eight times in the last ten weeks.Natural Gas Rig Count: The natural gas rig count of 194 was the same as the count for the week ended Mar 29. With this, the tally increased six times in seven weeks.Moreover, like oil, the count of rigs exploring gas is above the year-ago tally of 165.Per the recent report, the number of natural gas-directed rigs is almost 88% below the all-time high of 1,606 achieved in late summer 2008.Rig Count by Type: The number of vertical drilling rigs of 56 units declined from 63 units. However, the horizontal/directional rig count (encompassing new drilling technology that has the ability to drill and extract gas from dense rock formations, also known as shale formations) rose by 17 units to 947 units.Gulf of Mexico (GoM): The GoM rig count is at 12 units — all the rigs were oil-directed — in line with the tally for the week ended Mar 29.ConclusionThe number of total rigs exploring in the United States increased, courtesy of the addition of five onshore rigs in the Oklahoma state and two onshore rigs in Texas.Per the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), the average monthly prices of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude during January and February of 2018 were recorded at $63.70 per barrel and $62.23 per barrel, respectively. Notably, the average monthly WTI crude price has never touched $60 since 2015. Also, throughout March, the commodity traded above the $60-per-barrel mark. Overall, the crude pricing scenario seems healthy which has opened up room for further ramp up of drilling activities.Two energy stocks that should make valuable additions to your portfolio are Continental Resources, Inc.

18,BHGE,"We have already seen a few releases from S&P 500 companies in the Q2 earnings season. Major oilfield services companies will start reporting results starting Jul 21. Although our report shows that the Oil/Energy sector might post the healthiest earnings performance among all the 16 Zacks sectors, the story for the Zacks categorized Oil & Gas-Field Services industry is somewhat different.The industry has been grappling with huge debt and low cash balances. On top of that, cash flow from core operations is getting weaker by the day. The April-to-June quarter of 2017 has not been able to reverse the unimpressive performance of the Oil & Gas-Field Services industry over the last few quarters. Most importantly, during Q2, the industry underperformed the S&P 500 index.About the Oil & Gas Field Services IndustryCompanies belonging to this industry primarily support drilling players in efficiently setting up oil and gas wells. These firms are mainly engaged in manufacturing, repairing and maintaining equipment required for pumping oil.Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report), Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB  -  Free Report), Baker Hughes, a GE company (BHGE  -  Free Report) and Weatherford International plc (WFT  -  Free Report) are four premier oil field services companies. These companies are often referred to as the ‘Big Four.’Schlumberger, the largest player in the oilfield services industry, is expected to report Q2 earnings on Jul 21, while Halliburton – the second largest player in terms of market capitalization – will likely report on Jul 24. The companies carry a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) while the Earnings ESP for the respective firms are + 6.67% and +15.79%, respectively. Hence, our proprietary model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for the firms this quarter.Past Performances Lack LusterDeclining Cash Flow: The industry has not been performing well since the beginning of 2015. Our proprietary model shows that net cash flows from core operations in the industry has declined nearly 55% over the last two years.Huge Debt Load: The industry is faced with a high debt level. From $6000 million in long-term debts at the end of 2013, the level scaled to $8,500 at 2016-end. Also, cash balance declined substantially last year to slightly above $4,500 million.Industry Lags S&P 500 Pricing chart is generally referred to for analyzing the performance of any stock or industry over a period of time. The price chart clearly shows that the Oil & Gas-Field Services industry has underperformed the S&P 500 index throughout the second quarter.During the aforesaid period, the index rose 2.7% while the industry declined 15.6%. It is to be noted that in terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, the Oil & Gas-Field Services industry is among the weak performing industries. The industry is ranked #205 and lies in the bottom 20% of industries.What’s Behind the Bleak Scenario?Oil & Natural Gas Prices WeakOil and gas prices have been low for almost three years now and during second-quarter 2017, the prices of both the commodities slipped further. The prolonged weakness is owing to a persistently oversupplied commodity market.During the April-to-June quarter of this year, oil and natural gas prices fell 8.4% and 5%, respectively. Also, OPEC’s historical production cut extension deal until Mar 2018 has failed to drive oil.Natural gas is also an oversupplied commodity as is reflected by its inventory level of 2.816 tcf – as of Jun 23 – almost 7% higher than the five-year average mark (as per The U.S. Energy Information Administration).Oilfield Services Players at a DisadvantageDeclining oil and gas prices act as a deterrent for exploration and production companies as it affects the cashflow. In fact, many upstream companies are cutting down on their capital investment for exploitation activities which has led to a decline in proved reserves.These developments might reduce contracts for oilfield service companies.5 Trades Could Profit ""Big-League"" from Trump PoliciesIf the stocks above spark your interest, wait until you look into companies primed to make substantial gains from Washington's changing course.Today Zacks reveals 5 tickers that could benefit from new trends like streamlined drug approvals, tariffs, lower taxes, higher interest rates, and spending surges in defense and infrastructure.

(DO  -  Free Report) and Transocean Ltd. (RIG  -  Free Report).DetailsWeekly Summary: Rigs engaged in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas in the United States totaled 1052 in the week ended Jul 6, up from 1047 in the previous week. This marked an increase after the rig count fell for three consecutive weeks.Despite rig count slipping to an all-time low of 404 in May 2016, it has been rising rapidly in U.S. shale resources. The current national rig count is considerably higher than the prior-year level of 952.For the week under review, the rise in rig count can be only attributed to increased onshore operations. The number of onshore rigs totaled 1029, up from 1024. The tally for offshore rigs was recorded at 19, in line with the prior week’s count. Also, the number of rigs operating in the inland waters was four last week, same as the count for the week ended Jun 29.   Oil Rig Count: Oil rig count was 863, up from 858 for the week ended Jun 29, marking an increase after a decline for two weeks in a row.Moreover, the current tally, though far from the peak of 1,609 attained in October 2014, is significantly higher than last year’s 763.   Natural Gas Rig Count: The natural gas rig count of 187 is flat with the week ended Jun 29.Per the latest report, the number of natural gas-directed rigs is 88.4% below the all-time high of 1,606 recorded in 2008. Unlike oil, the count of rigs exploring gas is below the year-ago tally of 189.Rig Count by Type: The number of vertical drilling rigs totaled 55 units, down from the prior week tally of 56. The horizontal/directional rig count (encompassing new drilling technology that has the ability to drill and extract gas from dense rock formations, also known as shale formations) rose by six units to 997.Gulf of Mexico (GoM): The GoM rig count is 18 units, of which 15 were oil-directed. The count is in line with the week ended Jun 29.ConclusionThe number of rigs exploring in the United States increased primarily due to the addition of three oil rigs in the Williston Basin and one in each of the Eagle Ford and Permian basins.   West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude is trading close to $75-a-barrel psychological mark. As of now, worries of intensifying trade war tensions between the United States and China have gripped the energy market, keeping investors in the dark the direction of commodity prices. Also, the uncertainty of whether the higher oil output from Saudi Arabia and Russia will be able to offset global supply concerns emanating from Venezuela’s supply and Iran’s sanction issues has resulted in crude price volatility. Despites the uncertainties, oil price is trading at a healthy level, making the business scenario favorable for drillers.     Two energy stocks that should make valuable additions to your portfolio are Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (APC  -  Free Report) and Whiting Petroleum Corporation (WLL  -  Free Report). Both the stocks sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.We expect Anadarko Petroleum to witness year-over-year earnings growth of 229.6% in 2018.Whiting Petroleum has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all of the last four quarters.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.     Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

20,BHGE,"It was a week where oil prices finished at their highest since November 2014. Meanwhile natural gas futures fell slightly.On the news front, BP plc (BP  -  Free Report) announced the expansion of its electric vehicle charging business, while Baker Hughes, a GE company (BHGE  -  Free Report) is on the verge of ending its disastrous relationship with parent General Electric Company (GE  -  Free Report). Meanwhile, EQT Corporation (EQT  -  Free Report) will sell around 2.5 million non-core acres for $575 million.Overall, it was another mixed week for the sector. While West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures gained more than 8% to close at $74.15 per barrel, natural gas prices edged down some 0.7% to $2.924 per million Btu (MMBtu). (See the last ‘Oil & Gas Stock Roundup’ here: Shell, Baytex, Petrobras & OPEC)The U.S. oil benchmark hit a new three-and-a-half-year high last week on significantly higher-than-expected decline in domestic stockpiles, worries about tightening global supplies and doubts over OPEC’s ability to boost production.On the other hand, natural gas prices moved southward last week following an upward revision to EIA’s previously reported figures and forecasts for cooler temperatures that might lead to the fuel’s tepid use for air-conditioning.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    BPannounced that it has agreed to acquire Chargemaster, touted to have the largest network of charging points for electric cars in the UK.After the conclusion of the accord, BP will have the opportunity to set up ultra-fast chargers in all of its U.K.-based filling points. The united entity, BP Chargemaster, will likely own and operate roughly 1,200 forecourts of BP along with 6,500 charging units of Chargemaster. As per media reports, the transaction will be valued at $170 million.It is to be noted that BP Chargemaster will operate as a wholly owned affiliate of BP and all the current Chargemaster employees will be serving the newly-formed company. The British energy giant foresees mounting demand for electric vehicles (EV) in the coming years. From 1 million electric cars in 2016, the world will see roughly 300 million EVs by 2040, per BP. (Read more BP to Unveil EV Chargers in Stations with Chargemaster Buy)2.    Baker Hughes, a GE company will separate from parent company General Electric Company, which is planning to lower exposure in the volatile energy sector.Over the next two to three years, General Electric will likely sell its 62.5% stake in Baker Hughes to strengthen its balance sheet and simplify operations. In July 2017, General Electric had acquired Baker Hughes and merged the affiliate with its oil and gas equipment and services businesses.However, investors didn’t cheer the acquisition as following its closure, share prices of both the companies plunged. Baker Hughes has lost 39.2% since the acquisition, underperforming the 5.3% collective decline of the stocks belonging to the industry, while General Electric slipped 49.1%. (Read more Baker Hughes to Part Ways With General Electric in 2-3 Years)3.    EQT Corporation recently agreed to divest around 2.5 million non-core Huron Play acres for $575 million, to Diversified Gas and Oil Plc. The net acres are located in Southern Appalachia. The transaction is expected to conclude in July 2018.The all-cash deal enabled the company to sell net acreages in Kentucky, Virginia, and southern West Virginia. In the last reported quarter, net production from around 12,000 wells in the area came in about 200 million cubic feet of gas equivalent per day. Per the company, the assets consist of net proved developed reserves of 1.6 trillion cubic feet of gas equivalent.  Around 250 employees, currently working at the site, will be transferred to Diversified Gas and Oil.The financial and operational guidance for 2018 will be revised as a result of the divestment, which the company plans to disclose in the April-June earnings report that is slated to be announced on Jul 26. (Read more EQT Gears Up for Huron Play Acres' Divestment to Reduce Debt)4.    Oasis Petroleum, Inc. (OAS  -  Free Report) recently inked two separate deals to offload some of its non-operating assets in the Williston Basin, in a bid to upgrade its portfolio. The transaction is valued at $283 million. However, details of the buyers have been kept under wraps. The divested non-core assets comprise 65,000 acres in North Dakota and Montana, having an estimated production capacity of 4,400 barrels of oil equivalent per day (Boe/d).The proceeds from this transaction will enable the company to pay for the acquisition of Permian acreage from San Antonio-based Forge Energy. In an attempt to diversify its holdings away from North Dakota, Oasis Petroleum acquired around 22,000 acres in the prolific Delaware Basin earlier this year. The deal has undoubtedly opened the gateway for Oasis Petroleum in the Delaware Basin, which is the most profitable area for oil explorers of late due to low production cost.Oasis Petroleum paid a huge premium for this $946-million acquisition deal, funded through cash and stock. In order to finance the deal, the company had resorted to issuing new stocks and also planned to jettison its non-core Williston assets to raise cash. In fact, it had announced its plans to sell around 200,000 acres, accounting for 8000-10,000 Boe/d, for approximately $500 million.The latest agreements highlight the company’s progress toward its target. Oasis Petroleum remains committed to evaluate and vend the additional non-pivotal acreage in order to streamline portfolio and strengthen its position in the prolific Delaware Basin. (Read more Oasis Petroleum to Vend Non-Core Williston Assets for $283M)5.    Shares of Cheniere Energy, Inc. (LNG  -  Free Report) plunged on Thursday after Carl Icahn pared down his stake in the liquefied natural gas exporter. The activist hedge fund billionaire said in a filing that entities controlled by him sold nine million of his 32.7 million shares in Cheniere Energy. That marks a roughly 27.5% divestiture of the firm’s ownership.Cheniere Energy’s stock tumbled on the news, falling 3.9% to $64.86. Icahn, who still has two members on Cheniere Energy’s board, remains the Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company’s largest shareholder with a roughly 9.5% stake. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Despite trimming his position in Cheniere Energy, Icahn expressed his confidence in Cheniere Energy’s management and Chief Executive Officer Jack Fusco.

(DO  -  Free Report) and Transocean Ltd. (RIG  -  Free Report).DetailsWeekly Summary: Rigs engaged in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas in the United States totaled 1047 in the week ended Jun 29, down from 1052 in the previous week. This marked a decline in rig count for three weeks in a row.  Despite rig count slipping to an all-time low of 404 in May 2016, it has been rising rapidly in U.S. shale resources. The current national rig count is considerably higher than the prior-year level of 940.For the week under review, the fall in rig count can be only attributed to reduced onshore operations. The number of onshore rigs totaled 1024, down from 1032. However, the tally for offshore rigs was recorded at 19, up from the prior week’s count of 18. Also, the number of rigs operating in the inland waters was four last week, higher than two for the week ended Jun 22.  Oil Rig Count: Oil rig count was 858, down from 862 for the week ended Jun 22, marking a decline for two straight weeks.However, the current tally, though far from the peak of 1,609 attained in October 2014, is significantly higher than last year’s 756.  Natural Gas Rig Count: The natural gas rig count of 187 lags 188 for the week ended Jun 22. Notably, the tally for gas rigs fell for three consecutive weeks. Per the recent report, the number of natural gas-directed rigs is 88.4%, below the all-time high of 1,606 in 2008.  However, like oil, the count of rigs exploring gas is above the year-ago tally of 184.Rig Count by Type: The number of vertical drilling rigs totaled 56 units, down from the prior week tally of 60. The horizontal/directional rig count (encompassing new drilling technology that has the ability to drill and extract gas from dense rock formations, also known as shale formations) fell by one unit to 991.Gulf of Mexico (GoM): The GoM rig count is 18 units, of which 15 were oil-directed. The count is in line with the week ended Jun 22.ConclusionThe number of rigs exploring in the United States declined primarily due to the removal of three onshore rigs from Texas and two from North Dakota.  West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude is again approaching the $75-a-barrel psychological mark. Although the pricing scenario of oil is favorable for drillers, the production possibilities in the domestic shale plays — especially the Permian — remain dull owing to the pipeline bottleneck problem. In other words, the bottleneck in transportation capacity and labor shortage have made Permian operations expensive.Despite the unfavorable business scenario, investors may bet on a few oil and gas explorers.

23,BHGE,"Major energy players on the S&P 500 index are expected to start reporting Q1 numbers starting mid-April. Like in the last three quarters, we expect the Energy sector to contribute majorly to the index’s earnings growth this time around. In fact, excluding Energy, we anticipate a drop in S&P 500’s earnings growth to 14.4% from 15.9%.Last year, the sector generated $11.6 billion in net operating cashflow, which was enough to meet capital expenditures of $5.5 billion. This resulted in positive free cashflow of $6.1 billion in 2017, the highest since 2009.We also believe that the healthy crude pricing scenario will help the sector report substantial free cashflow in Q1.Oil Pricing Scenario RosyPer the U.S Energy Information Administration (EIA), average WTI crude prices for the first two months of 2018 have been $63.70 and $62.23 per barrel, respectively. The average monthly oil price had never traded near the $60 per barrel mark since 2015. Also, during the entire of March, the commodity traded above $60, reflecting a healthy pricing scenario.The oil production cut extension deal signed by OPEC players late last year continued to support the rally in crude. On Nov 30, 2017, OPEC members met non-OPEC players to decide on an extension of the crude production cut accord, first signed in late 2016, beyond the first quarter of 2018. All crude exporters decided to extend the deal through 2018-end.Strong Earnings GrowthWe expect Energy to post the strongest earnings growth in first-quarter 2018, courtesy of the tick up in oil price. Compared with the January-to-March quarter of 2017, Energy is expected to see earnings growth of 60.8% on 15.7% higher revenues, per the latest Earnings Trends.Notably, Energy’s Q1 earnings growth is expected to surpass 20.9% of the technology sector — the market’s largest segment with boundless investment opportunities. Moreover, for the second, third and fourth quarters of 2018, we project Energy’s earnings growth at 112.5%, 62.2% and 51.2% respectively.For the first quarter of this year, we expect Energy to record $14.6 billion in earnings, higher than $11.4 billion and $9.1 billion in fourth-quarter 2017 and first-quarter 2017, respectively. On top of that, for the second, third and final quarters of 2018, we look forward to Energy raking in $17.3 billion, $17.8 billion and $17.3 billion, respectively.Which Energy Players Will Make the Most?The fate of upstream energy firms is largely dependent on oil prices. With increased exploration and production activities, a higher number of rigs will likely get hired and oil field services players are expected to clinch more contracts for setting up oil wells.In fact, the market has seen a ramp up of crude drilling activities in the January-to-March quarter of 2018. As per data provided by Baker Hughes, a GE company (BHGE  -  Free Report) – oilfield service provider – the total number of rigs exploring oil fields in the United States rose from 747 to 797 in the aforesaid quarter.Choosing stocks with earnings beat potential might be a difficult task unless one knows the way to shortlist.

24,BHGE,"In its weekly release, Baker Hughes (BHGE  -  Free Report), a GE company, reported an increase in total rig count in the United States.About the Rig CountBaker Hughes’ data, issued at the end of every week since 1944, helps energy service providers gauge the overall business environment of the oil and gas industry.Change in this Houston-based oilfield services player’s rotary rig count impacts demand for energy services like drilling, completion and production provided by the likes of Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report), Schlumberger Limited (SLB  -  Free Report), Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO  -  Free Report) and Transocean Ltd. (RIG  -  Free Report).DetailsWeekly Summary: Rigs engaged in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas in the United States totaled 995 in the week (ended Mar 23) — higher than the prior week’s 990. Notably, total count increased seven times in the last nine weeks.Since it slipped to an all-time low of 404 in May 2016, rig count has been rising rapidly in U.S. shale resources. Punctuated by a few pauses, the current nationwide rig count is considerably higher than the prior-year level of 809.For the week in discussion, the rise in rig count can be attributed to higher onshore operations. The number of onshore rigs totaled 979, higher than 973.Three rigs operated in the inland waters last week, down from four for the week ended Mar 16. The tally for offshore rigs was flat at 13.Oil Rig Count: Oil rig count rose to 804 from 800 for the week ended Mar 16. Moreover, the current tally, though far from the peak of 1,609 attained in October 2014, is significantly higher than last year’s 652. The oil rig count rose eight times in the last nine weeks.  Natural Gas Rig Count: The natural gas rig count of 190 was up from 189 for the week ended Mar 16. With this, the tally increased six times in nine weeks.Moreover, like oil, the count of rigs exploring gas is above the year-ago tally of 155.Per the recent report, the number of natural gas-directed rigs is 88.2% below the all-time high of 1,606 achieved in late summer 2008.Rig Count by Type: The number of vertical drilling rigs of 63 units increased from 57 units. However, the horizontal/directional rig count (encompassing new drilling technology that has the ability to drill and extract gas from dense rock formations, also known as shale formations) fell by a unit to 932 units.Gulf of Mexico (GoM): The GoM rig count is at 13 units — 12 of which were oil-directed — in line with the tally for the week ended Mar 16.ConclusionThe number of total rigs exploring in the United States increased, courtesy of the addition of seven oil rigs in the Permian basin.  West Texas Intermediate crude has crossed the $65-per-barrel mark, thanks to Middle East tensions and the projection of Khalid al-Falih — energy minister of Saudi Arabia — that the production cut accord could get extended till 2019.  Hence, we believe that there is considerable opportunity for U.S. shale players to continue ramping up drilling activities.  Two energy stocks that should make valuable additions to your portfolio are Continental Resources, Inc. (CLR  -  Free Report) and Concho Resources Inc. (CXO  -  Free Report). Both the stocks sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

25,BHGE,"Oil prices have gained almost 10% since falling to a ten-month low in late June. Plunging to $42 per barrel on June 21 and officially entering a bear market, the commodity was pushed down by the ongoing rebound in U.S. shale production, OPEC’s slow progress toward rebalancing the market and restored output from exempted African producers Libya and Nigeria. Some feared more pessimism ahead with the notoriously-volatile crude’s return to the sub-$30 prices of early last year.But West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures seems to have come back from the brink and rallied to climb above $45 a barrel.  Crude Spurred by Decline in Oil & Product StockpilesOil’s recent rebound has been fueled by multiple weeks of strong inventory draws in the U.S. crude and gasoline stockpiles.The nation's oil stockpiles have shrunk in 12 of the last fourteen weeks and the latest decline – of 7.56 million barrels for the week ending July 7 – was its biggest in 10 months. Over the last two weeks, inventories have slumped by 13.9 million barrels, narrowing the five-year average storage surplus down to 103.05 million barrels. Importantly, stocks at the Cushing terminal in Oklahoma – the key delivery hub for U.S. crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange – is currently at 57.56 million barrels, the lowest since November 2015.Gasoline stocks have also been going down. As per EIA’s latest inventory release, supplies of gasoline were down for the fourth successive week as demand strengthened and imports declined. The 1.65 million barrels draw took gasoline stockpiles down to 235.66 million barrels.As a result of recent decreases, the existing stock of the most widely used petroleum product has now fallen 1.8% below the year-earlier level. Moreover, implied demand rose 81,000 barrels per day and has averaged 9.711 million barrels per day the last four weeks – above the five-year average for the same period.It’s this comprehensive decline in oil and product inventories the energy traders have been waiting to see all this while.  But Plenty of Risks RemainDespite the recent uptick in prices, the sustainability of these gains is highly uncertain as the oil market is still in a lot of trouble.Arguably, the biggest headwind is the steady climb in U.S. shale production. Last week it rose to 9.40 million barrels per day, the most since July 2015. The biggest development in global oil markets over the last few years, the relentless increase in North American shale output has repeatedly undermined efforts by OPEC and other major producers’ efforts to ‘rebalance’ the market and prop up prices.Now at a financial equilibrium, the shale firms are putting more rigs and employees back to work. Throughout the downturn, producers worked tirelessly to cut costs down to a bare minimum and look for innovative ways to churn out more oil from rock. And they managed to do just that by improving drilling techniques. With these efforts, many upstream companies have repositioned themselves to adapt to the new $45 oil reality and even thrive at those prices.Another concern is that despite the Saudi-led OPEC cartel’s best efforts in draining the oil glut through production cuts, the group’s exports are still at fairly high levels that is minimizing the impact of their own curbs.What Does the Future Hold?The uncertainty of oil prices means that the future direction of the commodity’s movement is anybody's guess. While we cheer strong inventory draws in the U.S., there are still a host of bearish factors that might induce oil’s fall into the mid-$30s and spell doom for investors.On the contrary though, the commodity’s recovery to $45, predictably, has had a positive effect on stocks in the sector. In particular, savvy investors might view the price bump as the impetus the stocks need after freefalling for three years. Undoubtedly still a long way to go, but improving crude prices may have already primed certain oil producers and linked entities for upward momentum.Play It SmartBut it’s important to keep in mind that even in these tumultuous times, there are some stocks that stands out.Amid the uncertainty, it is necessary that investors adopt a cautious approach. It is prudent to opt for large cap stocks. These have a market capitalization of over $10 billion, and also have further room for upside. These companies enjoy leading market positions, have a global footprint, strong cash positions and are large enough to stay strong even in the face of unfavorable events.To guide investors to the right picks, we highlight 5 stocks that carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The Zacks Rank is a reliable tool that helps you to trade with confidence regardless of your trading style and risk tolerance.

30,BHGE,"Baker Hughes, a GE company (BHGE  -  Free Report) will separate from parent company General Electric Company (GE  -  Free Report), which is planning to lower exposure in the volatile energy sector.Over the next two to three years, General Electric will likely sell its 62.5% stake in Baker Hughes to strengthen its balance sheet and simplify operations. In July 2017, General Electric had acquired Baker Hughes and merged the affiliate with its oil and gas equipment and services businesses.However, investors didn’t cheer the acquisition as following its closure, share prices of both the companies plunged. Baker Hughes has lost 39.2% since the acquisition, underperforming the 5.3% collective decline of the stocks belonging to the industry, while General Electric slipped 49.1%.Although crude prices have made a massive comeback, Baker Hughes scattered international operations could not benefit from the surge in commodity prices. Also, demand for drill bits and refinery valves of Baker Hughes will likely be blunt in the long term since the energy market is expected to be hurt by limited operational possibilities in prime oil plays and political disturbances, Bloomberg added.All those uncertainties might have convinced General Electric to offload Baker Hughes stake. Sonny Randhawa of Seaport Global Securities LLC announced that the entire interest of General Electric in Baker Hughes will not be sold through corporate buyout but will involve a number of share divestments. Randhawa added that Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report) and Schlumberger Limited (SLB  -  Free Report) might be potential buyers but they will not get the approvals from the regulators.Baker Hughes is a leading oilfield service player.

31,BHGE,"General Electric Company (GE  -  Free Report) yesterday communicated plans to restructure its business portfolio, in a bid to become a high-tech industrial company — focused on Aviation, Power and Renewable Energy. The news lifted market sentiment toward the stock, which rallied 7.8%, ending the trading session at $13.74.As part of the plan, General Electric has decided to separate GE Healthcare and turn it into a stand-alone company. GE Healthcare — which provides medical imaging and information technologies, patient monitoring systems, and biopharmaceutical manufacturing technologies — has generated roughly $19 billion revenues in 2017 while recorded an impressive 9% growth in segmental profit.The company plans to sell 20% interest in GE Healthcare while intends on distributing 80% stake to shareholders in a tax-free manner. The spin-off will likely be completed in the coming 12-18 months. It is worth mentioning here that the current president and CEO of GE Healthcare, Kieran Murphy, will continue to head the business, post the spin-off.In addition, General Electric intends to dispose of its 62.5% interest stake in Baker Hughes, a GE company (BHGE  -  Free Report). This Texas-based oilfield service provider was formed in last July when General Electric merged its oil and gas services, and equipment business with the acquired assets of Baker Hughes Inc. The stake disposition, to be carried out in the next two to three years, is going to mark the exit of the company from oil and gas businesses.As a reminder, in May 2018, General Electric signed an agreement to combine GE Transportation with Wabtec Corporation. In lieu of its transportation business, the company will receive $2.9 billion in cash at the time of the closing of the transaction (anticipated in early 2019) while its shareholders will gain 50.1% ownership interest in the combined company.Also, General Electric reiterated its intention of shrinking GE Capital business, aiming $25-billion sales in finance assets (energy and industrial) by 2020 and assuming capital contribution of $3 billion in 2019. Moreover, it is working on lowering its exposure to the insurance business.With all these restructuring initiatives, along with other deals like the divestment of Distributed Power business to Advent International a couple of days ago and the disposition of Value-Based Care business by GE Healthcare to Veritas Capital in April this year, the company seems to have achieved its $20-billion assets-divestment target.Benefits From Restructuring ActionsAll of the above-mentioned restructuring moves will make General Electric a more focused player in the aviation, power and renewable energy industry. Its technological expertise, as well as solid product offerings and innovation-investments, will strengthen its businesses.The company anticipates realizing corporate savings of more than $500 million by 2020, resulting from the implementation of the new GE Operating System. It intends to maintain its quarterly dividend until the completion of GE Healthcare separation while it might consider some revision post the completion.Moreover, for its Industrial business, the company intends on reducing debt by $25 billion by 2020, net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of less than 2.5, long-term credit rating of ‘A’ and cash balance of $15 billion.General Electric currently has a market capitalization of $119.4 billion. This conglomerate’s share price has yielded 0.4% return in the past three months, as against 1% decrease recorded by the industry.Stocks to ConsiderSome stocks worth considering in the industry are Federal Signal Corporation (FSS  -  Free Report) and Honeywell International Inc. (HON  -  Free Report). Both the stocks carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

32,BHGE,"In its weekly release, Baker Hughes, a GE company (BHGE  -  Free Report) reported an increase in total rig count in the United States.About the Rig CountBaker Hughes’ data, issued since 1944 at the end of every week, helps energy service providers gauge the overall business environment of the oil and gas industry.Change in this Houston-based oilfield services player’s rotary rig count hampers demand for energy services like drilling, completion and production provided by the likes of Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report), Schlumberger Limited (SLB  -  Free Report), Weatherford International plc (WFT  -  Free Report), Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO  -  Free Report) and Transocean Ltd. (RIG  -  Free Report).   DetailsWeekly Summary: Rigs engaged in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas in the United States totaled 981 in the week (ended Mar 2) — higher than the prior week’s 978. Notably, the total count increased for four in the prior six weeks.Since it slipped to an all-time low of 404 in May 2016, rig count has been rising rapidly in U.S. shale resources. Punctuated with a few pauses, the current nationwide rig count is considerably higher than the prior-year level of 756.For the week in discussion, the rise in rig count can be attributed to increased onshore operations. The number of onshore rigs were 963, higher than 959. Four rigs operated in the inland waters last week, up from the count of two for the week ended Feb 23.  However, the tally for offshore was 14, down from 17 in the prior week.Oil Rig Count: Oil rig count of 800 was up from 799 for the week ended Feb 23. Further, the current tally, though far from the peak of 1,609 attained in October 2014, is significantly above the previous year’s count of 609. It should be noted that since 2015, the count of rigs exploring for oil touched 800 for the first time.Natural Gas Rig Count: The natural gas rig count of 181 was up from 179 for the week ended Feb 23. With this, the tally increased thrice in the last four weeks.Moreover, like oil, the count of rigs for gas exploration sits comfortably above the year-ago tally of 146.  Per the recent report, the number of natural gas-directed rigs is nearly 89%, below the all-time high of 1,606 achieved in late summer 2008.Rig Count by Type: The number of vertical drilling rigs of 59 units decreased from 67 units. Moreover, the horizontal/directional rig count (encompassing new drilling technology that has the ability to drill and extract gas from dense rock formations, also known as shale formations) increased by 11 units to 922 units.Gulf of Mexico (GoM): The GoM rig count is at 14 units — 13 of which were oil-directed — compared with 17 units for the week ended Feb 23.ConclusionThe number of rigs exploring oil and natural gas in the United States increased, courtesy of the addition of two gas rigs in the Marcellus shale play.Crude pricing scenario has been healthy after the OPEC members agreed to extend the production curb deal beyond first-quarter 2018. Given that oil has been trading mostly over the $60-per-barrel mark since January, we believe that there is considerable opportunity for U.S. shale players to continue ramping up drilling activities.Two energy stocks that should make valuable additions to your portfolio are Continental Resources, Inc. (CLR  -  Free Report) and Concho Resources Inc. (CXO  -  Free Report). Both the stocks sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.

34,BHGE,"Shares of General Electric (GE  -  Free Report) gained about 8% in early morning trading Tuesday after the struggling multinational conglomerate announced plans to spin off its health-care business and separate its stake in Baker Hughes (BHGE  -  Free Report) over the next few years.The moves should help General Electric pare down its debt and sharpen its focus on core businesses like aviation, power, and renewable energy.“We are confident that positioning GE Healthcare and BHGE outside of GE’s current structure is best not only for GE and its owners, but also for these businesses, which will strengthen their market-leading positions and enhance their ability to invest for the future, while carrying the spirit of GE forward,” said CEO John Flannery in a statement.General Electric also noted that it will maintain its current quarterly dividend until after the spinoff of its health-care business is complete. The company then plans to adjust the dividend “in line with industrial peers.”GE’s new strategy aims to reduce the firm’s debt pile by about $25 billion by 2020 and generate at least $500 million in corporate cost savings through the end of that year.The much-needed turnaround plan comes on the same day that GE is officially being replaced by Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA  -  Free Report) on the Dow. GE was the last remaining original member of the index, but its recent struggles left many calling for more-accurate representation on the blue-chip gauge.General Electric shares have lost more than 50% over the past year and now sit about 80% lower than their all-time highs seen during the early 2000s. The company has struggled to find value in its assets over the past decade as a shifting economy left many of its businesses in the dust.Investors will hope that GE’s turnaround strategy can reinvigorate the stock, trim the company’s fat, and modernize its core businesses.They will also hope that today’s plan inspires some positive analyst sentiment for GE, which has watched its current-year earnings outlook deteriorate in recent weeks. Downward earnings estimate revisions have dragged our consensus projection for GE’s 2018 earnings three cents lower over the past quarter, earning the stock a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).General Electric is now expected to witness its annual earnings slump by about 9.5% year over year.Want more market analysis from this author?

Notably, the total count increased for three in the prior five weeks.Since it slipped to an all-time low of 404 in May 2016, rig count has been rising rapidly in U.S. shale resources. Punctuated by a few pauses, the current nationwide rig count is considerably higher than the prior-year level of 754.For the week in discussion, the rise in rig count can be attributed to increased onshore operations.

36,BHGE,"The fourth-quarter earnings season is picking up pace, with 16.1% of the energy companies — representing 14.9% of the S&P 500’s total market capitalization — having already reported results.Per the latest Earnings Trends, total earnings for these firms increased 140.1% on 39.2% growth in revenues, both on a year-over-year basis. Most importantly, the releases of energy companies so far have shown a beat for both the top and the bottom line.ExxonMobil (XOM  -  Free Report), the largest publicly traded energy firm, and smaller rival Chevron (CVX  -  Free Report) have yet to report their numbers this earnings season. Let’s take a look at which of these oil majors has an edge over the other ahead of their Q4 release on Feb 2.Before delving deeper into numbers, let's discuss the oil and natural gas pricing scenario during the October-to-December quarter since commodity prices determine the fate of energy players to a great extent.Q4 Oil & Gas Prices EncouragingWest Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude increased almost 20% in the fourth quarter of 2017, per The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). Through most of November and the entire month of December, the commodity traded above the $55-per-barrel psychological mark. The extension of the production cut deal by OPEC players supported the rally. On Nov 30, 2017, OPEC members met non-OPEC players to decide on an extension of the crude production cut accord, first signed in late 2016, beyond the first quarter of 2018. More than 20 oil producers, including leading exporters like Russia and Saudi Arabia, attended the meeting. As expected by most analysts, all crude exporters decided to extend the deal through 2018-end. Saudi Arabia, Russia and their allies have pledged to put 1.8 million barrels a day of crude oil out of the market through the end of this year.Like oil, natural gas price reflected a gain of 25.5% through fourth-quarter 2017.XOM vs. CVXWe have assessed these oil companies on four parameters.Price PerformanceDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, Chevron clearly outpaced ExxonMobil in terms of price performance. Chevron rallied 6.5% compared with ExxonMobil’s 2%.  ESP and Earnings HistoryEarnings ESP is our proprietary methodology for identifying stocks that have high chances of surprising in their upcoming earnings announcement. It shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Our research shows that for stocks with the combination of a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP, the chance of a positive earnings surprise is as high as 70%.  Chevron is likely to beat earnings in the quarter to be reported. This is because the stock has an Earnings ESP of +0.31% and a Zacks Rank #3. However, the picture is different for ExxonMobil with an Earnings ESP of 0.00%.The snapshot for earnings surprise history seems comparable as both Chevron and ExxonMobil managed to surpass the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four quarters.Projected Earnings Growth We expect year-over-year 2017 earnings growth of a massive 335% for Chevron, significantly higher than 56.5% for ExxonMobil.The picture is quite similar for the fourth quarter of 2017. We project 486.4% earnings growth for Chevron, way higher than ExxonMobil’s 19% for the quarter.Upstream PerformanceThrough 2017, oil and gas plays in the United States have witnessed a higher number of drillers.  Data provided by Houston-based oilfield services player Baker Hughes, a GE company (BHGE  -  Free Report), clearly showed an increase from 665 to 929 in rig count during the aforesaid period.Upstream operations in the United States have been lucrative, with Chevron having an advantage over ExxonMobil. Investors should know that both the integrated energy players generate a chunk of their earnings from upstream operations.For Chevron, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter 2017 earnings from the U.S. stands at $154 million, against a loss of $26 million in the third quarter. The estimate also stands higher than the year-ago quarter’s $121 million. (See more on Why Chevron Could See Its Upstream Earnings Rise in Q4).We expect ExxonMobil to see a loss from U.S. business even though its likely to be narrower than the prior quarter. For upstream operations in the domestic region, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for after-tax loss is pegged at $114 million, significantly narrower than 238 million and $2.3 billion reported in the preceding and year-ago quarter, respectively. (See more on Can Upstream Operations Fuel ExxonMobil's Q4 Earnings?)Bottom LineChevron is poised for a better fourth quarter, as the company clearly scores higher than ExxonMobil in all the four parameters.Our model also backs Chevron when it comes to earnings projections for 2018. We expect Chevron to witness earnings growth of 42.2% in 2018, higher than ExxonMobil’s 26.7%.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

37,BHGE,"In its weekly release, Houston-based oilfield services player Baker Hughes, a GE company (BHGE  -  Free Report), reported a decline in total rig count in the United States.Details on Rig CountBaker Hughes’ data, issued since 1944 at the end of every week, helps energy service providers gauge the overall business environment of the oil and gas industry.Change in Baker Hughes’ rotary rig count hampers demand for energy services like drilling, completion and production provided by the likes of Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report), Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB  -  Free Report), Weatherford International plc (WFT  -  Free Report), Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO  -  Free Report) and Transocean Ltd. (RIG  -  Free Report).DetailsWeekly Summary: Rigs engaged in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas in the United States totaled 936 in the week ended Jan 19 — lower than the prior week’s 939. This marked a decrease in rig count for three times in the last four weeks.Since it slipped to an all-time low of 404 in May 2016, rig count has been rising rapidly in U.S. shale resources. Punctuated by a few pauses, the current nationwide rig count is considerably higher than the prior-year level of 694.For the week in discussion, the fall in rig count can be attributed to decreased onshore operations. The number of onshore rigs were 916, lower than 919. The tally for offshore and inland waters were 19 and 1, in line with the respective counts for the week ended Jan 12. Oil Rig Count: Oil rig count of 747 slipped from 752 recorded for the week ended Jan 12. This marked a decline after the domestic plays witnessed the addition of 10 rigs through the week ended on Jan 12.However, the current tally, though far from the peak of 1,609 attained in October 2014, is significantly higher than the previous year’s count of 551.Natural Gas Rig Count: The natural gas rig count of 189 was up from 187 for the week ended Jan 12. Like oil, the count of rigs for gas exploration sits comfortably above the year-ago tally of 142.   Per the most recent report, the number of natural gas-directed rigs is 88.2%, below the all-time high of 1,606 achieved in late summer 2008.Rig Count by Type: The number of vertical drilling rigs of 57 units fell from the count of 62 for the week ended Jan 12. However, the horizontal/directional rig count (encompassing new drilling technology that has the ability to drill and extract gas from dense rock formations, also known as shale formations) increased by two units to 879.Gulf of Mexico (GoM): The GoM rig count is at 19 units — 16 of which were oil-directed — in line with the tally for the week ended Jan 12.ConclusionThe number of rigs exploring oil decreased while the count for natural gas increased. Overall, the total tally of rigs in the United States declined, thanks to the removal of the respective four and three rigs from the Utica and Eagle Ford shale plays. In the Utica resources, natural gas rig count fell from 27 to 24, while the tally for oil rig was zero against 1 in the week ended Jan 12. At the Eagle Ford shale, the count of rigs exploring crude fell from 62 to 58.On top of that, two rigs were removed from each of DJ-Niobrara basin, Cana Woodford shale and Barnett shale play.Although the count of oil rigs fell, there has been plenty of room for crude explorers to ramp up drilling, given that the commodity has been trading above the $60-per-barrel mark.  Energy stocks that should make valuable additions to your portfolio are Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation (COG  -  Free Report) and EOG Resources, Inc. (EOG  -  Free Report). Both the stocks sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.   Headquartered in Houston, TX, Cabot is primarily engaged in exploration and development activities. We expect the company to see year-over-year earnings growth of more than 357% in 2017.Headquartered in Houston, TX, EOG Resources is also an upstream energy player. The company is likely to witness year-over-year earnings growth of 157.1% in 2017.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of All Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

38,BHGE,"We expect Halliburton Company’s (HAL  -  Free Report) Completion and Production segment — which makes up around 65% of the oilfield service provider’s total revenue and more than 80% of its operating income — to post improved results in fourth-quarter 2017. This could help Halliburton notch its 14th consecutive quarterly outperformance when it reports on Monday, Jan 22.(See more in Is Halliburton Poised for a Beat This Earnings Season?)   The Completion and Production segment supplies cementing, stimulation, intervention and completion services. The unit comprises of production enhancement services, completion tools and services, and cementing services.A Look at Halliburton’s Completion and Production Performance in Q3Completion and Production revenue grew 12.9% sequentially and 62.5% from the year-ago level. Operating income from the segment was $525 million, significantly higher than the $24 million a year ago. The division also improved from previous quarter’s income of $397 million, helped by better utilization and pricing in the North American land market -- especially in Halliburton’s pressure pumping, completion tools and cementing product service lines.Oil Tailwinds to Boost Q4 ActivityWith U.S. rig count falling to record levels in 2016, oilfield services players (like Halliburton) were hit hard. Unprecedented declines in activity levels and a sharp fall in upstream spending led to lower revenues and pricing headwinds. However, as commodity prices steadily improve and drilling activities pick up, the market for services companies is on the mend.The U.S. oil benchmark wrapped up a strong quarter amid continued declines in domestic inventories and an improving supply-demand narrative. With fundamentals pointing to a tighter market, oil ended 2017 at $60.42 per barrel – the first settlement above $60 since June 2015. A year ago, crude futures hovered around the $53 per barrel mark.Though we are still not anywhere near the activity highs seen in 2014, spending on exploration projects have experienced a much-awaited rebound. The energy explorers, buoyed by the jump in commodity prices, are set for improving sales and earnings – a part of which is likely to be pocketed by the long-struggling oilfield service providers.In particular, the North American land market is improving rapidly, driven by increased utilization and pricing -- particularly for pressure pumping.Completion and Production Unit to BenefitConsequently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Halliburton’s largest segment’s fourth-quarter revenue is pegged at $3,641 million, 60.5% higher than the reported figure in the corresponding quarter of 2016 and up 3% sequentially.And with the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company seeing continued pricing strength, its operating income for the division is expected to jump to $570 million from just $85 million in the fourth-quarter of 2016 and representing a 9% sequential increase.(You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.)Overall Earnings & Revenue ProjectionsNotably for the world's second-largest oilfield services company after Schlumberger (SLB  -  Free Report), the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of 46 cents reflects a massive growth from the prior-year quarter profit of 4 cents. Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of $5,574 million indicates a 38.6% increase on a year-over-year basis.Our TakeThe improving oil price outlook and strengthening North American market conditions have led to strong demand for Halliburton’s completions equipment and services. This will support the company’s top and bottom-line growths.Earnings Schedules of Other Major Oilfield Service ProvidersAmong the major players, Schlumberger is scheduled to release today, while Baker Hughes, a GE company (BHGE  -  Free Report) will report on Jan 24. Weatherford International plc (WFT  -  Free Report), another biggie, will report fourth-quarter earnings early next month.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars? Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers.

39,BHGE,"SchlumbergerLimited’s (SLB  -  Free Report) fourth-quarter 2017 earnings of 48 cents per share (eliminating charges and credits) surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 44 cents and the year-earlier figure of 27 cents.Total revenues of $8,179 million improved from the year-earlier level of $7,107 million and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8,116 million.Surge in SIS software sales, ramp up of drilling operations in Colombia and Argentina along with higher pricing in North America’s onshore market supported the strong fourth-quarter results.Schlumberger is the first among the “Big Four” oilfield service and equipment providers to report fourth-quarter results. The other players — Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report), Baker Hughes, a GE company (BHGE  -  Free Report) and Weatherford International plc (WFT  -  Free Report) — will likely report results on Jan 22, Jan 24 and Feb 2, respectively.Segmental PerformanceEach of the groups — Reservoir Characterization, Drilling Group and Production Group — recorded a year-over-year rise in earnings.Drilling Group revenues increased primarily on contributions from the international market. Ramp up of activities in Colombia and Argentina also drove revenues. On top of that, profits at the business unit were supported by the commencement of new projects in China and Qatar.Results at the Production Group were mostly buoyed by solid activities in the international market. Increased operations in Russia, Argentina and Saudi Arabia drove the segment’s fourth-quarter numbers. Surge in pricing in North America’s onshore market also contributed to the outperformance.   The Reservoir Characterization segment was also supported by strong contributions from the international market. Jump in sales of SIS software led to increased profits.Reservoir Characterization: Revenues totaled $1,638 million compared with $1,676 million in the prior-year quarter. However, pre-tax operating income totaled $360 million, up 13% year over year.   Drilling Group: Revenues of $2,180 million rose 8% year over year.

40,BHGE,"We should have known something big was coming when General Electric (GE  -  Free Report) slashed its dividend in half last November, and now, it looks like the industrial and infrastructure giant is mulling a restructuring move that would break up the company.The speculation began when GE announced that it will be taking an after-tax GAAP charge of $6.2 billion to its fourth quarter earnings—at the new 21% tax rate, the charge will be $7.5 billion—a significant hit that is linked to weakness in the company’s North American Life & Health insurance portfolio.This is a shining example of the difficulties GE and other long-term care insurers and re-insurers have faced over the years. Because of the rise in healthcare costs, and the simple fact that people are living longer, many insurers are struggling to “make good on policies dating back to the 1990s,” notes Reuters.GE also said that over the next seven years, it’s financing segment GE Capital would make $15 billion statutory reserve payment contributions to the long-term care insurance assets. But in order to fund this, the company will be suspending GE Capital’s dividend for the “foreseeable future.”In a conference call with analysts, CEO John Flannery said that “We are looking aggressively at the best structure or structures for our portfolio to maximize the potential of our businesses,” and a review “could result in many, many different permutations, including separately traded assets really in any one of our units, if that’s what made sense.”“Needless to say, at a time when we are moving forward as a company, I am deeply disappointed at the magnitude of the charge,” Flannery said on the call. “It’s especially frustrating to have this type of development when we’ve been making progress on many of our key objectives.”Not only is Flannery seemingly implying that a breakup for GE is on the horizon, but sources told CNBC’s David Faber that a split is “likely,” and could come as soon as this spring.Shares of GE closed the day down almost 3% to $18.21 per share.A Fading IconWhen Flannery took over from previous CEO Jeffrey Immelt last August, he had big plans for GE. He made a promise to consider all options for the company, and emphasized a business strategy that would concentrate on jet engines, health-care machines, and power-generation equipment.Fast forward to November, and you could see those plans beginning to come into focus, though some cost cutting and other major business decisions had to happen first. Besides its dividend cut, GE is planning over $2 billion in cuts this year, along with $20 billion in divestments over the next year or two.This could include the potential sale of oil and gas company Baker Hughes (BHGE  -  Free Report); GE just bought a majority stake in BHGE last year, and the consolidation of each respective company’s oil and gas businesses is going smoothly. GE previously sold its real estate portfolio, its water business, its unit that makes electrical equipment for utilities, its dishwasher and appliance business, and sold its media properties NBC and Universal Studios to Comcast (CMCSA  -  Free Report).Additionally, the company said that there will be “ongoing actions” to shrink GE Capital’s business over the next two years, continuing a plan set in motion back in 2015 to sell the majority of its finance division’s operations.Too Little Too Late?While its insurance arm has certainly been struggling, it’s just another problem in a long list of problems for GE.The company was the worst performer on the Dow in 2017, with shares losing almost 40% in value. Margins have been on the decline since 2014, and the company’s free cash flow has grown less and less consistent, especially after it decided to sell its very lucrative lending business.Chart via: ZacksSince its founding in 1892, GE grew into a business icon, creating a portfolio along the way that spanned everything from energy and infrastructure to finance and media. The company was once looked to as a reliable symbol of American success, and during the ‘80s and ‘90s, its management practices gained a huge following under then-CEO Jack Welch.Under Jeffrey Immelt, GE began to shrink, with a goal of focusing on businesses it could win in and getting rid of the ones that were distractions. But compared to other multinational rivals like Honeywell (HON  -  Free Report) and United Technologies (UTX  -  Free Report), GE’s continued underperformance became even more glaring.What’s next for the company? If a breakup is on the docket, GE and its management must make sure that each of its core businesses are performing at the levels where they need to be, and that may be a tough thing to accomplish.But even if GE decides to split up, what’s the guarantee that the move will help the company bounce back? Flannery’s narrowed vision certainly has potential, and a fresh leader at the head of the table is never a bad thing for an older institution like GE. However, with a weakening brand name and strong growth competitors, a breakup may not be the easiest fix for GE after all.GE reports its fourth-quarter earnings on January 24.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

41,BHGE,"In its weekly release, Houston-based oilfield services player Baker Hughes, a GE company (BHGE  -  Free Report), reported an increase in total rig count in the United States.About the Rig CountBaker Hughes’ data, issued since 1944 at the end of every week, helps energy service providers gauge the overall business environment of the oil and gas industry.Change in Baker Hughes’ rotary rig count hampers demand for energy services like drilling, completion and production provided by the likes of Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report), Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB  -  Free Report), Weatherford International plc (WFT  -  Free Report), Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO  -  Free Report) and Transocean Ltd. (RIG  -  Free Report).DetailsWeekly Summary: Rigs engaged in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas in the United States totaled 939 in the week ended Jan 12 — higher than the prior week’s 924. This marked an increase after the tally decreased for two straight weeks.Since it slipped to an all-time low of 404 in May 2016, rig count has been rising rapidly in U.S. shale resources. Punctuated by a few pauses, the current nationwide rig count is considerably higher than the prior-year level of 659.   For the week in discussion, the rise in rig count can be attributed to increased onshore and offshore operations. The number of onshore rigs were 919, higher than 906. The tally for offshore was 19, up from 17. One rig operated in the inland waters last week, in line with the count for the week ended Jan 5.  Oil Rig Count: Oil rig count of 752 jumped from 742 recorded for the week ended Jan 5. Moreover, the current tally, though far from the peak of 1,609 attained in October 2014, is significantly above the previous year’s count of 522.   Natural Gas Rig Count: The natural gas rig count of 187 was up from 182 for the week ended Jan 5. Like oil, the count of rigs for gas exploration sits comfortably above the year-ago tally of 136.  Per the most recent report, the number of natural gas-directed rigs is nearly 89% below the all-time high of 1,606 achieved in late summer 2008.Rig Count by Type: The number of vertical drilling rigs of 62 units is in line with the tally for the week ended Jan 5. Moreover, the horizontal/directional rig count (encompassing new drilling technology that has the ability to drill and extract gas from dense rock formations, also known as shale formations) increased by 15 units to 877.Gulf of Mexico (GoM): The GoM rig count is at 19 units — 16 of which were oil-directed — up from 17 for the week ended Jan 5.ConclusionThe number of rigs exploring oil and natural gas in the United States increased. The addition of three oil rigs in the Permian basin primarily supported the upside.Crude pricing scenario has been healthy after the OPEC members agreed to extend the production curb deal beyond first-quarter 2018. Given that oil crossed the $60-per-barrel mark, we believe that there is considerable opportunity for U.S. shale players to ramp up drilling activities.Two energy stocks that should make valuable additions to your portfolio are Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation (COG) and EOG Resources, Inc. (EOG). Both the stocks sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.    Headquartered in Houston, TX, Cabot is primarily engaged in exploration and development activities.

With this, the count fell for two weeks in a row.Since it slipped to an all-time low of 404 in May 2016, rig count has been rising rapidly in U.S. shale resources. Punctuated by a few pauses, the current nationwide rig count is considerably higher than the prior-year level of 665.For the week in discussion, the fall in rig count can be attributed to decreased onshore, offshore and inland operations. The number of onshore rigs were 906, lower than 909. The tally for offshore was 17, down from 18. One rig operated in the inland waters last week against the count of two for the week ended Dec 29. Oil Rig Count: Oil rig count of 742 fell from 747 recorded for the week ended Dec 29.

Naturally, the total oil and gas rig count fell, primarily due to the removal of five onshore and one offshore rig in Louisiana. Two rigs were also removed from Oklahoma.The crude pricing scenario has been healthy after the OPEC members agreed to extend the production curb deal beyond first-quarter 2018. The fall in U.S drilling rigs also supported the crude rally.Given that oil crossed the $60-per-barrel mark, we believe that the business scenario has been favorable for exploration and production players.Two energy stocks that should make valuable additions to your portfolio are Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation (COG  -  Free Report) and Approach Resources Inc.

44,BHGE,"Among the major oilfield services firms, Schlumberger Limited (SLB) and Halliburton Company (HAL) deserve a special mention, given their massive market caps of $86.4 billion and $38.8 billion, respectively. These companies dominate and define the industry to which they belong to.Both of these firms have interesting earnings surprise histories. Halliburton surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in each of the prior four quarters with an average positive earnings surprise of 41.2%. However, Schlumberger beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in only one of the last four quarters and came up with an average positive earnings surprise of 4.2%.Given that West Texas Intermediate crude recently traded at $60 per barrel– the highest mark since Jun 25, 2015 – we can say the business environment is highly favorable for oilfield services players. The latest rig count report by Houston-based Baker Hughes (BHGE) clearly shows that the number of rigs exploring for oil and gas in the United States has increased from 665 to 931, year to date. Ramping up drilling activities should call for more oilfield service contracts. Although both the stocks are attractive picks for investors based on their earnings reports and favorable business scenario, our research shows Halliburton is a better choice than Schlumberger for 2018. The AnalysisWe have employed three parameters for an in-depth comparative analysis.Positive Earnings Estimate RevisionsEarnings estimate revisions are at the heart of the Zacks investment philosophy. Stocks that have recently had their estimates revised upward by analysts tend to outperform the market in the next 9-12 months.In the last 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Halliburton’s 2018 earnings has risen from $2.11 per share to $2.16 per share. Moreover, for 2018, we expect the company to report year-over-year earnings growth of 86.5%.However, the story is different for Schlumberger. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 has been revised downward, from earnings per share of $2.25 to $2.14 in the last 60 days. Also, for 2018, we anticipate the company to witness year-over-year earnings growth of 46%.Strong Potential to Generate Cash FlowInvestors often look for indicators that help them determine the ability of a company to generate free cash flow from investments. For this purpose, we have employed the free cash flow yield ratio. Companies with strong operations generally have high free cash flow yield.Our proprietary model shows that free cash flow yield for Halliburton is 3.7%, higher than 3.5% for Schlumberger.  Sufficient Funds to Meet Capital ExpenditureA company’s free cash flow is calculated after deducting capital spending from operating cash flow. In the last four quarters, free cash flow for Halliburton came in at $1.566 billion, indicating that the firm has sufficient cash flow to fund capital spending.In other words, Halliburton generated $2.516 billion in net cash from core operations, while its capital spending amounted to $950 million. Most importantly, its trailing twelve-month free cash flow for 2017 has turned positive from negative free cash flow of $2.279 billion in 2016, reflecting massive improvement in the company’s operations. Although Schlumberger’s free cash flow of $3.289 billion is higher than that of Halliburton, it has been decreasing steadily since 2015. If the trend continues, Schlumberger’s reliance on debt capital for financing future operations will increase.ConclusionOur comparative analysis shows that the returns from investment at Halliburton are higher than Schlumberger. On top of that, earnings estimate revision trends are also in favor of Halliburton.This is reflected in Halliburton’s Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which suggests that the stock could outperform the broader U.S. equity market over the next one to three months. Meanwhile, Schlumberger carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

46,BHGE,"The S&P 500 index witnessed steady growth in earnings over the last three quarters and will likely report earnings growth in the fourth quarter as well. As per our report, the index garnered a total of $277.3 billion, $293.4 billion and $303.2 billion in the first, second and third quarters, respectively. For the October-to-December quarter, we expect higher earnings for the S&P 500 at $310.9 billion.We note that the energy sector has been a major contributor to the S&P 500’s growth story. In fact, among all the 16 Zacks sectors in the index, energy is probably the only one which is expected to witness triple-digit earnings growth in Q4.Hence, it seems prudent for investors to choose stocks from a sector that has clearly crushed the S&P 500 in 2017.Healthiest Free Cash Flow Since Oil WeaknessBefore considering any particular stock or sector, investors should analyze the security’s free cash flow. Free cash flow measures the amount of operating cash flow remaining for business investments after deducting capital spending.   Our proprietary model shows that the Zacks Oil-Energy sector has witnessed almost a 161.1% rise in free cash flow over the trailing 12 months. Also, the sectors free cash flow has been the healthiest since the free fall in crude price in mid-2014.  Reflecting the bullishness, long-term debt for the sector declined over the first nine months of 2017. Short-term debt also plunged reflecting the sector’s improving financial strength.  What’s Driving the Energy Sector?The improving financial metrics were primarily supported by a partial recovery in crude price in 2017. Looking at the U.S. Energy Information Administration’s (EIA) average crude prices for all the months in 2017, it is clear that the commodity pricing scenario has been much better than the prior-year period.                            The year 2017 has been a remarkable one for energy investors with the OPEC agreeing to extend the production cut deal beyond the first quarter of 2018, an imperative step to fight the global crude glut. On Nov 30, OPEC members met non-OPEC players to decide on an extension of the crude production cut accord, first signed in late 2016. More than 20 oil producers, including leading exporters like Russia and Saudi Arabia, participated in the meeting.As expected by most analysts, all crude exporters decided to extend the deal through 2018-end. Through the end of next year, Saudi Arabia, Russia and their allies pledged to put 1.8 million barrels a day of crude oil out of the market.Which Energy Stocks Beat the S&P 500? Year to date, the S&P 500 index rallied 20.6%. The U.S. stock market is regularly scaling all-time highs. Stocks have mostly rallied since last year’s election, with a booming U.S. economy, supportive monetary policy and robust corporate earnings being the key growth drivers. Expectations that the Trump administration’s proposed tax and regulatory reforms will help companies and consumers have boosted investors’ sentiments further. There are energy stocks that have rallied higher than the S&P 500 on a year-to-date basis. Before zeroing in on the stocks, let us take a look at how the upstream, midstream and downstream businesses have fared in 2017.The healthy oil price scenario was favorable for upstream business as explorers were able to sell the commodity at a higher price. This resulted in an increased number of drilling rigs at domestic oil resources, per the report of Houston-based oilfield services player Baker Hughes, a GE company (BHGE  -  Free Report).

47,BHGE,"In its weekly release, Houston-based oilfield services player Baker Hughes, a GE company (BHGE  -  Free Report), reported a decline in total rig counts in the United States.About the Rig CountBaker Hughes’ data, issued since 1944 at the end of every week, helps energy service providers gauge the overall business environment of the oil and gas industry.Change in Baker Hughes’ rotary rig count dents demand for energy services like drilling, completion and production provided by the likes of Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report), Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB  -  Free Report), Weatherford International plc (WFT  -  Free Report), Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO  -  Free Report) and Transocean Ltd. (RIG  -  Free Report).DetailsWeekly Summary: Rigs engaged in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas in the United States totaled 930 in the week ended Dec 15 — lower than the prior week’s 931. This marked the decrease for the first time after the tally rose for five weeks in a row.Since the all-time low of 404 last May, rig count has been rising rapidly in U.S. shale resources. Punctuated by a few pauses, the current nationwide rig count is considerably higher than the prior-year level of 637.For the week in discussion, the fall in rig count can be attributed to decreased offshore operations. The count of rigs engaged in offshore works fell from 20 to 19. The tally for onshore and inland activities remained in line with the count for the week ended Dec 8.Two rigs operated in the inland waters last week, while 909 rigs worked onshore.Oil Rig Count: Oil rig count of 747 was lower than 751 in the prior week. However, the current tally, though far from the peak of 1,609 attained in October 2014, is significantly above the previous year’s count of 510.       Natural Gas Rig Count: The natural gas rig count — which plunged to its lowest last August — of 183, was up from 180 for the week ended Dec 8. Moreover, like oil, the rig count for gas exploration sits comfortably above the year-ago tally of 126.        As per the latest report, the number of natural gas-directed rigs is almost 89% below the all-time high of 1,606 achieved in late summer 2008.Rig Count by Type: The number of vertical drilling rigs of 60 units fell from 64. However, the horizontal/directional rig count (encompassing new drilling technology that has the ability to drill and extract gas from dense rock formations, also known as shale formations) increased by three units to 870.Gulf of Mexico (GoM): The GoM rig count stands at 19 units — 15 of which were oil-directed. The present count shows a decline from 20 units recorded in the week ended Dec 8.ConclusionThe number of rigs exploring oil in the United States has decreased, while the same for natural gas went up. The total oil and gas rig count slipped, thanks to the removal of four rigs from Cana Woodford shale and three from the Permian basin.Rig counts have recently snapped a five-week streak of gains. However, it is difficult to say whether the tally will continue to fall in the coming weeks. This is because the crude pricing scenario is healthy and OPEC’s November production has touched a six-month low, per the monthly oil market report of the cartel.Two oil stocks that should make valuable additions to your portfolio are Northern Oil and Gas, Inc.

48,BHGE,"In its weekly release, Houston-based oilfield services player Baker Hughes, a GE company (BHGE  -  Free Report), reported an increase in total rig counts in the United States.About the Rig CountBaker Hughes’ data, issued since 1944 at the end of every week, helps energy service providers gauge the overall business environment of the oil and gas industry.Change in Baker Hughes’ rotary rig count dents demand for energy services like drilling, completion and production provided by the likes of Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report), Schlumberger Ltd.

Punctuated by a few pauses, the current nationwide rig count is considerably higher than the prior-year level of 624.   For the week in discussion, the rise in rig count can be attributed to increased onshore operations. The count of rigs engaged in onshore works rose from 908 to 909. The tally for offshore activities remained in line with the count for the week ended Dec 1.Two rigs operated in the inland waters last week, higher than one rig for the week ended Dec 1.Oil Rig Count: Oil rig count of 751 was higher than 749 in the prior week.

Naturally, the total oil and gas rig count has increased, primarily supported by the addition of three rigs in each of Permian basin, Marcellus, Eagle Ford and Haynesville shale plays.A healthy crude price scenario owing to the consistent compliance of the OPEC members with the historical production curb deal have been encouraging U.S drillers to ramp up upstream operations in prospective shale plays.  Two oil stocks that should make valuable additions to your portfolio are Northern Oil and Gas, Inc.

49,BHGE,"In its weekly release, Houston-based oilfield services player Baker Hughes, a GE company (BHGE  -  Free Report), reported an increase in oil rig count in the United States. However, the number of rigs searching for natural gas has declined.DetailsWeekly Summary: Rigs engaged in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas in the United States totaled 940 in the week ended Sep 29 – higher than the prior week’s 935. This marked an increase in total rig count after the tally declined six times in the last nine weeks.  Since it slipped to an all-time low of 404 last May, rig count has been rising rapidly in U.S. shale resources. Punctuated by a few pauses, the current nationwide rig count is considerably higher than the prior-year level of 522.For the week in discussion, the increase in rig count can be attributed to increased onshore and offshore operations. The count of rigs engaged in offshore works rose from 19 to 22, while the tally for onshore activities jumped to 916 from 913.However, the number of rigs for inland waters fell by one unit to two.Oil Rig Count: Oil rig count rose by six to 750. It is to be noted that the rigs exploring crude increased after falling for three weeks in a row. Also, the current tally, though far from the peak of 1,609 attained in October 2014, is significantly above the previous year’s count of 425.    Natural Gas Rig Count: The natural gas rig count – which plunged to its lowest last August – declined by one unit to 189. Like oil, the count of rigs for gas exploration sits comfortably above the year-ago tally of 96.

(SLB  -  Free Report), Weatherford International plc (WFT  -  Free Report), Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO  -  Free Report) and Transocean Ltd. (RIG  -  Free Report).ConclusionThe number of rigs exploring natural gas in the United States has decreased, however, the count for oil has increased. Overall total oil and gas rig count has jumped, primarily supported by the addition of four rigs in Utah. Louisiana witnessed two more rigs for upstream operations.  Weak oil prices led the explorers to lower the number of drilling rigs in the domestic crude resources. But after oil crossed the $50-per-barrel mark, the upstream business seemed lucrative and drillers started gathering in crude patches.Development in this front is likely to prove beneficial for oil and gas exploration and production companies.

52,BHGE,"The Vienna meeting between 14 OPEC members and crude exporters outside the cartel, headed by Russia, has been quite a breather for energy investors. The crude output cut deal extension beyond the January-to-March quarter of 2018 is expected to drive oil prices outside the bearish territory.The move was taken in order to fight the global crude glut that affected the energy market for more than three years, leaving oil explorers with weak balance sheets. In fact, many upstream players were facing difficulties in continuing operations after oil started hitting multi-year lows post mid-2014.  We believe that this measure taken by OPEC and Russia will benefit U.S. shale players. Drillers in the domestic shale resources will cash in on the favorable crude pricing environment to strengthen their financials. Most importantly, the rebound in exploration activities in the domestic shale segment will boost oil supply and partially nullify the impact of the OPEC agreement.OPEC Extends Deal as ExpectedOn Nov 30, OPEC members met non-OPEC players to decide on an extension of the crude production cut accord, first signed in late 2016, beyond the first quarter of 2018. More than 20 oil producers, including leading exporters like Russia and Saudi Arabia, participated in the meeting.As expected by most analysts, all crude exporters decided to extend the deal through 2018-end. Through the end of next year, Saudi Arabia, Russia and their allies pledged to put 1.8 million barrels a day of crude oil out of the market.The crude price chart of oilprice.com clearly showed that following the conclusion of the Vienna meeting, on Dec 1, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil traded at $58.72 per barrel on 9:51 am CST, close to $59.05 — the highest since mid-2015.Boon for US Shale DrillersThe extended agreement is driving oil toward bullish territory. This is a blessing for domestic shale companies as favorable crude pricing has made exploration operations lucrative.With more profit, shale drillers will be able to lessen their debt, which has been accumulating since the crude-weakness era after mid-2014. Also, domestic explorers might resume returning cash to stockholders through dividend hikes and share repurchases.Which Oil Stocks to Pick?Oil drillers are flocking to U.S. crude resources, per the latest report by Houston-based oilfield services player Baker Hughes, a GE company (BHGE  -  Free Report). Rigs engaged in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas in the United States totaled 929 in the week ended Dec 1 — higher than the prior week’s 923. This marked an increase for four consecutive weeks after the tally fell for five weeks in a row.Hence, investing in fundamentally sound shale drillers is likely to be prudent. We have employed our proprietary Stock Screener to shortlist four stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).Based in Minnetonka, MN, Northern Oil and Gas, Inc. (NOG  -  Free Report) has exploration and production operations in the Bakken shale, and contributed significant crude production in the last four decades.The company sports a Zacks Rank #1, and has managed to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise being 175%.

(CXO  -  Free Report) has vast exploration and production operations in the Permian shale play.The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #2. It has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the last four quarters, the average positive earnings surprise being 118.6%.WildHorse Resource Development Corporation (WRD  -  Free Report), headquartered in Houston, TX, has oil producing acres in the Eagle Ford shale region.  The company, with a Zacks Rank of 2, is expected to witness year-over-year earnings growth of 276.3% in 2017.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

53,BHGE,"In its weekly release, Houston-based oilfield services player Baker Hughes, a GE company, reported an increase in crude and natural gas rig counts in the United States.About the Rig CountBaker Hughes’ data, issued since 1944 at the end of every week, helps energy service providers gauge the overall business environment of the oil and gas industry.Change in Baker Hughes’ rotary rig count dents demand for energy services like drilling, completion, production, etc., provided by the likes of Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report), Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB  -  Free Report), Weatherford International plc (WFT  -  Free Report), Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO  -  Free Report) and Transocean Ltd. (RIG  -  Free Report).   DetailsWeekly Summary: Rigs engaged in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas in the United States totaled 929 in the week ended Dec 1 — higher than the prior week’s 923. This marked an increase for four consecutive weeks after the tally fell for five weeks in a row.Since it slipped to an all-time low of 404 last May, rig count has been rising rapidly in U.S. shale resources. Punctuated by a few pauses, the current nationwide rig count is considerably higher than the prior-year level of 597.For the week in discussion, the rise in rig count can be attributed to increased onshore operations. The count of rigs engaged in onshore works rose from 900 to 908. However, the tally for offshore activities fell to 20 from 22.One rig operated in the inland waters last week. The count remains the same this week.Oil Rig Count: Oil rig count of 749 was higher than 747 in the prior week. Also, the current tally, though far from the peak of 1,609 attained in October 2014, is significantly above the previous year’s count of 477.     Natural Gas Rig Count: The natural gas rig count — which plunged to its lowest levels last August — increased by four units to 180. Moreover, like oil, the count of rigs for gas exploration sits comfortably above the year-ago tally of 119.    As per the most recent report, the number of natural gas-directed rigs is almost 89% below the all-time high of 1,606 achieved in late summer 2008.      Rig Count by Type: The number of vertical drilling rigs of 66 units remained in line with the earlier week, while the horizontal/directional rig count (encompassing new drilling technology that has the ability to drill and extract gas from dense rock formations, also known as shale formations) increased by six units to 863.Gulf of Mexico (GoM): The GoM rig count stands at 20 units — 16 of which were oil-directed — lower than the prior count of 22.ConclusionThe number of rigs exploring oil in the United States has increased. The count of rigs searching for natural gas also surged. Naturally, the total oil and gas rig count has increased, primarily supported by the addition of four rigs in the Permian basin and three rigs in the Haynesville play.A rise in total rig count, both from the year-ago and prior week figures, were primarily supported by rising oil and natural prices. Recently, crude and gas traded at $58.36 per barrel and $3.06 per million Btu, respectively, higher than last year’s average marks of $43.29 and $2.52 – per The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). Investors should know, anticipation by majority of the analysts that the production cut deal between OPEC and non-OPEC crude producers will be extended for another nine months next year, supported the rally in crude price.Recovering commodity prices are likely to prove beneficial for oil and gas exploration and production companies.

54,BHGE,"The scheduled meeting of OPEC members with non-OPEC crude exporters for the third time in Vienna, Austria, is dominating the headlines. It should provide an answer to the million-dollar question — will oil continue to trade above $55 a barrel?  The landmark production-cut accord, first signed in late 2016, helped oil cross the $50-a-barrel mark. After the deal, with the advancement of crude, major energy players regained financial strength and have been rewarding shareholders with healthy dividends.OPEC MeetingOn Nov 30, OPEC members will meet non-OPEC players to decide on an extension of the crude production cut accord beyond the first-quarter 2018. More than 20 oil producers, including leading exporters like Russia and Saudi Arabia, will participate in the Vienna meeting. The agreement entails putting roughly 1.8 million barrels a day of crude oil out of the market.Possible OutcomesMost analysts are expecting the Vienna meeting to conclude with a deal extension for another nine months next year.But Russia concerns might compel OPEC to push for either a shorter extension, say six months, or to delay its verdict until the first quarter next year, said CNBC. Both the decisions contradict the market’s expectations and hence could lead to a fall in oil prices.    Tom Kloza of Oil Price Information Service added that it will be difficult for crude to cross $59.05 even if the cartel chooses the nine-month extension because recent crude prices are already reflecting the information.Six-Month ExtensionAlternative investment manager Again Capital believes that it will be hard to convince Russia for more than a six-month extension.Again Capital added that Russian oil producers are not willing to extend the agreement as it will open up scope to ramp up drilling activities in the U.S. This in turn will hurt crude prices.No Decision on Deal ExtensionIf OPEC refrains from taking any decision in the Nov 30 Vienna meet, oil prices will collapse.  British multinational bank Barclays (BCS  -  Free Report) said that OPEC’s decision to delay its verdict until the first quarter of next year will disappoint the market. Per Barclays, Brent crude will decline to the mid-$50 range from more than $60 a barrel.Nine-Month ExtensionCNBC reveals that with the speculation of oil to go up, hedge funds are opting for more long positions on crude futures. The decision is creating a ceiling in the oil price chart as traders will probably book profits once the commodity reaches a certain mark.On top of that, the gathering of crude drillers in oil resources, as revealed by the recent rig count report of oilfield services player Baker Hughes, a GE company (BHGE  -  Free Report), will also hinder the crude rally.Baker Hughes reported that rigs engaged in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas in the United States totaled 923 in the week ended Nov 22 — higher than the prior week’s 915. This marked an increase for three consecutive weeks after the tally fell for five weeks in a row.Which Energy Stocks to Buy?The fate of energy companies largely depends on crude price. The article has already established that none of the probable outcomes of OPEC’s Vienna meeting could boost oil prices beyond the $60 per barrel mark. This will likely limit the potential of many energy players to generate incremental cashflows.Now, the challenge is to zero in on stocks that are shielded against the OPEC meeting outcome. We have employed our proprietary Stock Screener to shortlist four stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).These stocks also have a VGM Score of A or B. Here, V stands for Value, G for Growth, and M for Momentum, and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores.

55,BHGE,"In its weekly release, Houston-based oilfield services player Baker Hughes, a GE company (BHGE  -  Free Report), reported an increase in crude rig count in the United States. The number of rigs exploring natural gas, however, declined from the prior week.About the Rig CountBaker Hughes’ data, issued since 1944 at the end of every week, helps energy service providers gauge the overall business environment of the oil and gas industry.Change in Baker Hughes’ rotary rig count heavily dents demand for energy services like drilling, completion, production, etc., provided by companies like Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report), Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB  -  Free Report), Weatherford International plc (WFT  -  Free Report), Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO  -  Free Report) and Transocean Ltd. (RIG  -  Free Report).DetailsWeekly Summary: Rigs engaged in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas in the United States totaled 923 in the week ended Nov 22 — higher than the prior week’s 915. This marked an increase for three consecutive weeks after the tally fell for five weeks in a row.Since it slipped to an all-time low of 404 last May, rig count has been rising rapidly in U.S. shale resources. Punctuated by a few pauses, the current nationwide rig count is considerably higher than the prior-year level of 593.For the week in discussion, the rise in rig count can be attributed to increased onshore and offshore operations. The count of rigs engaged in offshore works rose from 21 to 22, while the tally for onshore activities jumped to 900 from 893.One rig operated in the inland waters last week. The count remains the same this week.Oil Rig Count: Oil rig count of 747 was higher than 738 in the prior week. Also, the current tally, though far from the peak of 1,609 attained in October 2014, is significantly above the previous year’s count of 474.   Natural Gas Rig Count: The natural gas rig count — which plunged to its lowest last August — fell by one unit to 176. However, like oil, the count of rigs for gas exploration sits comfortably above the year-ago tally of 118.  As per the most recent report, the number of natural gas-directed rigs is 89% below the all-time high of 1,606 achieved in late summer 2008.Rig Count by Type: The number of vertical drilling rigs increased by three units to 66, while the horizontal/directional rig count (encompassing new drilling technology that has the ability to drill and extract gas from dense rock formations, also known as shale formations) increased by five units to 857.Gulf of Mexico (GoM): The GoM rig count stands at 22 units — 18 of which were oil-directed — higher than the prior count of 21.ConclusionThe number of rigs exploring oil in the United States has increased, while the same for natural gas decreased. Overall total oil and gas rig count has increased, primarily supported by the addition of two rigs in the Permian basin. DJ-Niobrara basin witnessed a rig addition for upstream operations.   A rise in total rig count, both from the year-ago and prior week figures, were primarily supported by rising oil and natural prices. Recently, crude and gas traded at $58.11 per barrel and $2.93 per million Btu respectively, higher than last year’s average marks of $43.29 and $2.52 – per The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). Investors should know that lower U.S. oil inventory, owing to ramp up in export and more demand from refinery plants, supported the crude price.Recovering commodity prices are likely to prove beneficial for oil and gas exploration and production companies. Two oil stocks that should make valuable additions to your portfolio are Denbury Resources Inc. (DNR  -  Free Report) and Northern Oil and Gas, Inc. (NOG  -  Free Report). Both the stocks sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

57,BHGE,"On Monday, shares of industrial and infrastructure giant General Electric (GE  -  Free Report) are falling, down over 4.5% in mid-morning trading after the company announced that it has slashed its dividend in half, as well as other strategic business decisions.The dividend cut marks only GE’s second since the Great Depression, and the company said shareholders’ payout will now be 12 cents a share, down from 24 cents a share; the cut will become effective in December. GE’s only other dividend cut was back during the Great Recession in 2009.""We understand the importance of this decision to our shareowners and we have not made it lightly,"" Chairman and CEO John Flannery said in a statement. ""We are focused on driving total shareholder return and believe this is the right decision to align our dividend payout to cash flow generation.""GE also unveiled annual profit projections that were well below Wall Street expectations. The company said that 2018 will be a “reset” year, and anticipates profit in the range of $1 and $1.07 per share; analysts were expected $1.15 per share. Additionally, GE is expecting weak free cash flow of roughly $7 billion, about half the company’s normal level.The company is also making some changes to its board of directors, shrinking it down to 12 members from the current total of 18 by next April. Flannery said there will be three new directors who have “relevant industry experience,” as well as a 15-year term limit and annual elections for board members.Aside from these announcements, GE is planning some major cost cutting initiatives. While the company has already surpassed its $1 billion in industrial cost cuts this year, GE is planning over $2 billion in cuts next year—which doubles its original target—that goes along with at least $20 billion in divestments over the next year or two years, according to Flannery.This could include the possible sale of oil and gas company Baker Hughes (BHGE  -  Free Report). GE just bought a majority stake in Baker Hughes earlier this year, and even though the combining of each company’s oil and gas business is going smoothly, GE is looking to reduce its exposure to the volatile energy market.This move would follow the sales of GE’s real estate portfolio, its water business, its unit that makes electrical equipment for utilities, its dishwasher and appliance business, and its media properties NBC and Universal Studios to Comcast (CMCSA  -  Free Report).Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers.

60,BHGE,"In its weekly release, Houston-based oilfield services player Baker Hughes, a GE company (BHGE  -  Free Report), reported a rise in natural gas rig count in the United States.DetailsWeekly Summary: Rigs engaged in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas in the United States totaled 944 in the week ended Sep 8 – higher than the prior week’s 943. This shows an increase in total rig count for two weeks in a row after four straight weeks of a decline.Since it slipped to an all-time low of 404 last May, rig count has been rising rapidly in the U.S. shale resources. Punctuated by a few pauses, the current nationwide rig count is considerably higher than the prior-year level of 508.For the week in discussion, the rise in rig count can be attributed to increased activity in inland waters.Rig count in both onshore and offshore operations is in line with the prior week. The respective rig counts for onshore and offshore drilling are 923 and 16.Oil Rig Count: Oil rig count slipped by three to 756. It is to be noted that the rigs exploring crude has decreased five times in the last eight weeks.The current tally, though far from the peak of 1,609 attained in October 2014, is significantly above the previous year’s count of 414.     Natural Gas Rig Count: The natural gas rig count – which plunged to its lowest last August – jumped four units to 187. Like oil, the count of rigs for gas exploration sits comfortably above the year-ago tally of 92. As per the most recent report, the number of natural gas-directed rigs is nearly 89%, below the all-time high of 1,606 achieved in late summer 2008.      Rig Count by Type: The number of vertical drilling rigs rose by seven units to 75, while the horizontal/directional rig count (encompassing new drilling technology that has the ability to drill and extract gas from dense rock formations, also known as shale formations) was down by six to 869. Gulf of Mexico (GoM): The GoM rig count stands at 16 units – 13 of which were oil-directed – in line with the prior count.Details of the Weekly Rig CountBaker Hughes’ data, issued since 1944 at the end of every week, acts as an important yardstick for energy service providers in gauging the overall business environment of the oil and gas industry.Change in Baker Hughes’ rotary rig count weighs heavily on the demand for energy services, drilling, completion, production, etc., provided by companies like Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report), Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB  -  Free Report), Weatherford International plc (WFT  -  Free Report), Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO  -  Free Report) and Transocean Ltd. (RIG  -  Free Report).ConclusionThe number of rigs searching for natural gas in the United States increased, while that for oil decreased. Overall, total oil and gas rigs increased as the drillers gathered in the U.S. shale resources. Two rigs were added in each of the respective shale plays of Marcellus, Permian and Haynesville.We are expecting more rigs to come online as refiners along the gulf coast, hit by Hurricane Harvey, are gradually restarting operations. In other words, more demand for raw crude from the GoM refiners – accounted for more than 45% of domestic oil refining capacity, per The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) – might drive commodity prices and call for more rigs in the oil and gas patches.Development in this front is likely to prove beneficial for oil and gas exploration and production companies. Two oil stocks that might make valuable additions to your portfolio are Range Resources Corporation (RRC) and Lonestar Resources US (LONE). Both the companies sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

61,BHGE,"In its weekly release, Houston-based oilfield services player Baker Hughes, a GE company (BHGE  -  Free Report), reported a decline in rigs searching for crude and natural gas in the country. DetailsWeekly Summary: Rigs engaged in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas in the United States totaled 943 in the week ended Sep 1 – higher than the previous week’s 940. This shows that the total rig count in the country has increased again after four straight weeks of a decline.Since it slipped to an all-time low of 404 last May, rig count has been rising rapidly in American shale resources. Punctuated by a few pauses, the current nationwide rig count is considerably higher than the prior-year level of 497.For the week in discussion, the improvement in rig count can be attributed to higher onshore activities.Rig count in the onshore business increased by three units, while units engaged in offshore operations fell slightly to 16 from 17 in the prior week.  Oil Rig Count: Oil rig count was in line with the count of 759 recorded in the previous week. It is to be noted that the rigs exploring crude has decreased four times in the last seven weeks.The current tally, though far from the peak of 1,609 attained in October 2014, is significantly above the previous year’s count of 407. Natural Gas Rig Count: The natural gas rig count – which plunged to its lowest last August – jumped three units to 183. Like oil, the count of rigs for gas exploration sits comfortably above the year-ago tally of 88. As per the most recent report, the number of natural gas-directed rigs is nearly 89%, below the all-time high of 1,606 achieved in late summer 2008.Rig Count by Type: The number of vertical drilling rigs rose by four units to 68, while the horizontal/directional rig count (encompassing new drilling technology that has the ability to drill and extract gas from dense rock formations, also known as shale formations) was down by one to 875.Gulf of Mexico (GoM): The GoM rig count went down to 16 units – 14 of which were oil-directed – from 17 counts.Details of the Weekly Rig CountBaker Hughes’ data, issued since 1944 at the end of every week, acts as an important yardstick for energy service providers in gauging the overall business environment of the oil and gas industry.Change in Baker Hughes’ rotary rig count weighs heavily on the demand for energy services, drilling, completion, production, etc., provided by companies like Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report), Schlumberger Limited (SLB  -  Free Report), Weatherford International plc (WFT  -  Free Report), Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO  -  Free Report) and Transocean Ltd. (RIG  -  Free Report)            .ConclusionThe number of rigs searching for natural gas in the United States increased, while that for oil remained flat. This shows that Hurricane Harvey, which was responsible for heavy downpour in the Texas and Louisiana states of the Gulf of Mexico (GoM) area, failed to lower exploration activities.Although rig count in Texas fell by one unit and the count in Louisiana was flat as compared to the prior week, it seems that the storm has not been felt as much as apprehended.However, the counts might not be exact as the storm kept Baker Hughes from confirming the increase or decrease in the number of rigs in almost 47 counties of South Texas.After Harvey, some refiners are restarting their operations which led to a rally in the price of black gold. This is likely to prove beneficial for oil exploration and production companies.

62,BHGE,"Will crude oil cross the $100 a barrel mark again? Even though this seems quite unattainable--after mid-2014, the commodity hasn’t even treaded close to this benchmark thanks to the supply glut--the crude pricing scenario is looking up.Oil has been steadily recovering from its historic lows, currently trading above $50 a barrel. The recovery has been largely backed by OPEC’s compliance with its landmark production cut deal.Is the agreement leading OPEC to lose crude export market share in the race with U.S. shale players?Record-High Volume of Oil Export in US HistoryThe United States has never exported more than 2 million barrels of crude oil per day. During the week through Oct 27, the nation exported 2.13 million barrels a day of light oil, way higher than 400,000 barrels shipped after the lifting of the four-decade long ban on oil exports at the end of 2015, per CNBC. The all-time high export volumes were primarily supported by record weekly U.S. production. As per the Energy Information Administration (EIA), American crude output for the week ended Oct 27 was 9.55 million barrels a day, close to 9.61 million barrels — the highest in the week through Jun 5, 2015.The U.S. shale boom has been the primary reason for the record-high levels of export and production. The combination of hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling has made many oil projects economically viable, encouraging shale players to relentlessly pump out oil.Strong European Crude DemandAccording to Kpler, the lion’s share of export volumes was shipped to Europe. For the week ended Oct 27, the United States shipped 914,000 barrels of crude a day to the continent, significantly higher than the preceding week, reported Kpler. This clearly reflects the substantial demand for light oil in Europe.Though Asia has significant demand for U.S. crude, shipments to the continent surprisingly declined 54% from mid-September through October, per Kpler. However, the proportion of U.S. crude export to China — the largest importer of oil in the world, per EIA — jumped to 20%, as of July 2017, from 3.7% in 2016, per a media report.Also, on Oct 2, the United States exported a massive 1.6 million barrels of oil to India — the third largest crude importer in the world — for the first time, per CNBC.Investors should know that the significant discount of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) relative to Brent has made U.S. light oil popular among overseas crude buyers. As long as Brent is more expensive than WTI, demand for U.S. oil will remain high.OPEC Loses Market ShareOn Nov 30, 2016, OPEC signed a landmark deal to curb oil output by 1.2 million barrels a day. Following in the footsteps of the cartel, non-OPEC players headed by Russia decided to lower oil output by 558,000 barrels per day las December. Collectively, they decided to cut crude production by 1.8 million barrels each day.On May 25, the cut in oil production was extended until the first quarter of 2018. Now, speculations are rife that OPEC could extend the agreement through the end of 2018.To comply with the accord, OPEC is lowering supplies to major crude buyers, which has helped the United Sates gain an edge over OPEC.    US Shale Players to GainAs per rig count data provided by Baker Hughes, a GE company (BHGE  -  Free Report), total U.S. drilling rigs increased dramatically from 664 – as of Jan 8, 2016 – to 909 as of Oct 2, 2017. This shows that more shale players have gathered in the U.S. lately, supporting record US production that has resulted in soaring export.Growing U.S. crude export will definitely prove favorable for the shale players. Major shale-focused companies are EOG Resources, Inc. (EOG  -  Free Report), Whiting Petroleum Corporation (WLL  -  Free Report), Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM  -  Free Report), Apache Corporation (APA  -  Free Report), and Pioneer Natural Resources Company (PXD  -  Free Report).EOG Resources and Whiting Petroleum carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), while Apache and Pioneer carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Exxon Mobil – the largest publicly trading oil company – sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.

63,BHGE,"Major oilfield services provider Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report) reported better-than-expected third quarter profit thanks to improved utilization and pricing gains in North America – the company’s largest market by sales.Halliburton’s income from continuing operation came in at 42 cents per share, above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 38 cents – the thirteenth consecutive quarterly outperformance. Moreover, revenues of $5,444 million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5,318.9 million.Oil services companies (like Halliburton) – providers of technical products and services to drillers of oil and gas wells – are generally the first of the U.S. energy firms to kick off an earnings season. While two of the world’s biggest oilfield services providers – Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB  -  Free Report) and Baker Hughes, a GE company (BHGE  -  Free Report) – came out with September numbers on Friday, Oct 20, Weatherford International plc (WFT  -  Free Report), another biggie, will report third quarter earnings next week.Halliburton Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Halliburton Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Halliburton Company Quote North American Market BoomingAlong the results, Halliburton also sounded optimistic in its view that the North American land market is improving rapidly, driven by increased utilization and pricing - particularly for pressure pimping. As it is, rig counts have generally been rising during the last one and half years since plunging to an all-time low of 404 in May 2016, with the addition of a flood of new units. As a proof of the recovery, Halliburton grew its domestic land revenue by 14% sequentially, well ahead of the U.S. land rig count growth of 6%.Additionally, Halliburton’s international market proved resilient in the face of challenging circumstances. The company’s impressive expense management for the last several quarters helped regional sales rising more than 4% from the second quarter.Segmental PerformanceOperating income from the Completion and Production segment was $525 million, significantly higher than the year-ago level of $24 million. The division also improved from previous quarter’s income of $397 million, helped by better utilization and pricing in the North American land market - especially in Halliburton’s pressure pumping, completion tools and cementing product service lines.Meanwhile, Drilling and Evaluationunit profit improved from $151 million in the third quarter of 2016 to $180 million this year. The number was also above the $125 million earned in the June quarter. The outperformance was on account of higher drilling activity in the Middle East, North America and Latin America. This was supported by an expanding Consulting and Project Management product line in the Eastern Hemisphere.  Balance SheetHalliburton’s capital expenditure in the third quarter was $342 million.As of Sep 30, 2017, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company had approximately $1,898 million in cash/cash equivalents and $10,423 million in long-term debt, representing a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 53%.

64,BHGE,"Ensco plc (ESV  -  Free Report), a leading supplier of offshore contract drilling services to the oil and gas industry, is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 26, before the opening bell.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 16.67%. Moreover, Ensco delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 63.91% over the last four quarters.Which Way Are Estimates Treading?Let’s take a look at the estimate revisions in order to get a clear picture of analyst opinion on the stock before the earnings release.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 16 cents for the third quarter has widened from a loss of 15 cents over the last 30 days, with two firms revising downward. The consensus estimate reflects a year-over-year decline of about 163.3%.Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $454 million for the third quarter, down 17.2% from the year-ago quarter.Factors to ConsiderThe count of rig exploring for oil and natural gas during the third quarter fell from 952 to 940, per a report of oilfield services player Baker Hughes, a GE company (BHGE  -  Free Report). Lower rig operations in the U.S. resources reflect reduced activities of drillers, Ensco being no exception.Also, eroding cash balance since 2017 is a matter of concern. Since 2015, there has been a substantial decline in net cash flow from the company’s operations. This is reflecting the company’s persistent weak operations amid volatile commodity pricing scenario. Price Performance in Q3During the quarter, the company has rallied 15.7%, outperforming the industry’s 8% gain. Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Ensco is likely to beat earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.  Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for the company is -22.65% as the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at a loss of 19 cents, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is at a loss of 16 cents.

65,BHGE,"Oilfield service giant Schlumberger Limited’s (SLB  -  Free Report) third-quarter 2017 earnings of 42 cents per share (excluding charges and credits) were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The bottom line improved from the year-earlier adjusted figure of 25 cents.The company’s total revenue of $7,905 million improved from the year-earlier level of $7,019 million but failed to surpass the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7,910 million.Third-quarter earnings were driven by solid demand for directional drilling in the land market of North America. This was partially offset by major project completions in Mexico and Iraq.Schlumberger and Baker Hughes, a GE company (BHGE  -  Free Report), have reported third-quarter numbers. The other two players – Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report) and Weatherford International plc (WFT  -  Free Report) – belonging to the “Big Four” oilfield service and equipment providers – will likely report results on Oct 23 and Nov 1, respectively.  Segmental PerformanceEach of the groups – Reservoir Characterization, Drilling Group and Production Group – registered a year-over-year increase in revenues.Drilling Group revenues increased primarily on contributions from the North American market. Demand for directional drilling in the continent’s land market remained strong during the quarter. However, the positives were partially negated by the closure of Mexico and Iraq’s major developments – related to integrated drilling services.Results at the Production Group were driven by higher hydraulic fracturing work in the North American land market. Higher operations in the unconventional plays in the Middle East also led to the improvement.The Reservoir Characterization segment was supported by strong contributions from the international market. Surge in activities related to Wireline and Testing & Process in Russia and Norway led to the improvement in results. However, reduction of sales related to multiclient seismic license hurt the business unit.Reservoir Characterization: This group posted revenues of $1,771 million as against $1,667 million in the prior-year quarter. However, pre-tax operating income was $311 million, down 5% year over year.  Drilling Group: Revenues of $2,120 million rose 5% year over year. Pre-tax operating income was $301 million, up 38% year over year.Production Group: Revenues recorded by this group increased 37% from the year-earlier quarter to $2,876 million. Pre-tax operating income skyrocketed 212% year over year to $283 million.Cameron Group: This segment generated revenues of $1,297 million, down 3% year over year. Pre-tax operating income plunged 10% from the prior-year comparable period to $194 million.FinancialsAs of Sep 30, 2017, the company had approximately $4,952 million in cash and short-term investments and $15,871 million in long-term debt. This represents a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 30%. In the July-to-September quarter, the company bought back 1.5 million shares.  Q3 Price Performance  During the third quarter of 2017, Schlumberger has rallied 6%, outperformed the industry’s 1.7% gain.GuidanceFor 2017, the company projects investments of $2.1 billion, lower than the prior projection of $2.2 billion.Key DevelopmentIn a separate announcement, the company declared the execution of an agreement with Cenovus Energy (CVE  -  Free Report).

66,BHGE,"In its weekly release, Houston-based oilfield services player Baker Hughes reported a decrease in oil and gas rig counts in the United States.    DetailsWeekly Summary: Rigs engaged in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas in the United States totaled 928 in the week ended Oct 13 – lower than the prior week’s 936. This marked a decline in rig count for seven times in the last 10 weeks.   Since it slipped to an all-time low of 404 last May, rig count has been rising rapidly in U.S. shale resources. Punctuated by a few pauses, the current nationwide rig count is considerably higher than the prior-year level of 539.For the week in discussion, the fall in rig count can be attributed to lower onshore and offshore operations. The count of rigs engaged in offshore works slipped from 22 to 20, while the tally for onshore activities fell to 907 from 913.However, the tally for inland waters remained the same at one.Oil Rig Count: Oil rig count fell by five to 743. It is to be noted that the rigs exploring crude decreased for five times in the last six weeks. But, the current tally, though far from the peak of 1,609 attained in October 2014, is significantly above the previous year’s count of 432.  Natural Gas Rig Count: The natural gas rig count – which plunged to its lowest last August – declined by two units to 185. However, like oil, the count of rigs for gas exploration sits comfortably above the year-ago tally of 105. As per the most recent report, the number of natural gas-directed rigs is nearly 88.5%, below the all-time high of 1,606 achieved in late summer 2008.  Rig Count by Type: The number of vertical drilling rigs decreased by two units to 63, while the horizontal rig count (encompassing new drilling technology that has the ability to drill and extract gas from dense rock formations, also known as shale formations) fell by six units to 786.Gulf of Mexico (GoM): The GoM rig count stands at 20 units – 17 of which were oil-directed – lower than the prior count of 22.Details of the Weekly Rig CountBaker Hughes’ data, issued since 1944 at the end of every week, acts as a yardstick for energy service providers in gauging the overall business environment of the oil and gas industry.Change in Baker Hughes’ rotary rig count weighs heavily on demand for energy services, drilling, completion, production, etc., provided by companies like Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report), Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB  -  Free Report), Weatherford International plc (WFT  -  Free Report), Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO  -  Free Report) and Transocean Ltd. (RIG  -  Free Report).ConclusionThe number of rigs exploring oil and natural gas in the United States has decreased, thanks to the removal of six rigs from the Eagle Ford shale play. Moreover, the Barnett shale saw the removal of four rigs.Declining rig count, helping reducing crude glut, helped oil price to settle above the $50-per-barrel mark again.  Development in this front is likely to prove beneficial for oil and gas exploration and production companies.

70,BHGE,"As per North Dakota’s oil regulator, the state’s daily crude output fell 0.8% in Jun after dropping 0.9% in the previous month. The North Dakota Department of Mineral Resources’ (‘DMR’) latest data said that oil production in Jun averaged 1,032,495 barrels a day, down 8,500 barrels a day from May.Along with Oil, Gas Production Falls TooWhile daily output remained above 1 million barrels for the fifth month in a row, the small decline reflected in the newest numbers confirm the slowdown in the amount of oil extracted from North Dakota, centered on the Bakken Shale formation. Interestingly, it must be noted that at the end of June, the state’s total number of producing wells tallied 13,915, a new all-time high.With crude, natural gas output came down too – from May’s record 1,853,528 thousand cubic feet per day to 1,849,807 thousand cubic feet per day. As operators scramble to the core areas of the Bakken, wells here tend to produce more gas along with crude (present gas flare rate of around 12%).Current Production a Shadow of Earlier HighsChurning out as high as 1,227,483 barrels/day in Dec 2014, the current production statistics highlight oil’s horror show that has seen prices come down from $110 per barrel in mid-2014 to around $47 now, in between falling to a 12-year low of $26.21 in Feb 2016. The commodity’s collapse has fueled spending cuts and layoffs while threatening the industry’s creditworthiness by hurting cash flows, drying up liquidity and narrowing profit margins.Rig Count Clawing Back Steadily but Unlikely to Rise FurtherSome 55 drilling rigs were active in the state in Jun, up from 50 in May and Apr. The all-time low of 27 was set in May 2016, while a year ago, North Dakota had just 28 rigs operating. A closely watched yardstick of oil industry's strength, the steady rise in the number of units searching for oil and gas in the region indicates increase in drilling activities and essentially steady production.Notwithstanding recent gains, the rig count is still down considerably from the peak of May 2012 when North Dakota had 218 units drilling. Moreover, with oil prices tumbling some 19% year-to-date, the number of rigs are unlikely to ramp up beyond 55 this year. It’s because the current crude levels just won’t support any more drilling rigs.Increase in Wells, Rig Count Offset by Lack of Fracking CrewsEven as the rig count in North Dakota continues to rise and the number of producing wells in the state reach record highs, production is being stymied by the lack of hydraulic fracturing crews. At present, there are just around 22 frack crews in the state, not even half of the number of rigs. In particular, major oilfield service providers like Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB  -  Free Report), Baker Hughes, a GE company (BHGE  -  Free Report) and Halliburton Co. (HAL  -  Free Report) are struggling to get experienced, qualified workers following mass layoffs triggered by the three-year crude slump. The ongoing labor shortage is primarily responsible for the recent drops in North Dakota’s oil production numbers.Shale Industry Caught in a “Catch-22” SituationWhile more rigs in operation and stable production could be construed as positive developments for the state of North Dakota, the current sub-$50 oil prices will render a lot of drilling as unprofitable. And at the crux of the matter is the rising flood of U.S. shale-driven production.Now at a financial equilibrium, the shale firms are putting more rigs and employees back to work. Throughout the downturn, producers worked tirelessly to cut costs down to a bare minimum and look for innovative ways to churn out more oil from rock. And they managed to do just that by improving drilling techniques.With these efforts, many upstream companies have repositioned themselves to adapt to the new $50 oil reality and even thrive at those prices. In other words, while OPEC's moves to trim output and rebalance the demand-supply situation has stabilized the market to a large extent, in the process it has incentivized shale drillers to churn out more.In other words, the U.S. shale (including the likes of North Dakota and particularly the Permian Basin in Texas) is perhaps the biggest reason why crude prices are floundering again.What Lies Ahead?The fall in Jun production assumes greater significance considering that the oil bust is now anticipated to last through this year and well into 2018. In fact, with Jun production levels barely above the psychologically important one million barrel a day mark, there are chances that output in the second-largest oil producing state after Texas could fall below that figure toward the end of 2017 if prices fall under $45 a barrel and stay there for an extended period. But as of now, output should remain steady for at least the next two months.Dakota Access Pipeline: Can It Revive Production?While the oil weakness is expected to persist at least till the first half of 2018, there is one factor that might speed up the revival of Bakken output – the 1,100-mile-long Dakota Access Pipeline.Making good on his campaign promises to rev up infrastructure spending, President Trump ignored bitter opposition from environmental activists and signed executive order to smooth the way for Energy Transfer Partners L.P.’s (ETP  -  Free Report) $3.7 billion Dakota Access Pipeline just a few days into his new Administration. As a result, disregarding the censure from environmental groups and the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, the sponsor brought the controversial conduit online in early Jun.With the project’s arrival, operators have scrambled to use the Dakota Access Pipeline to send a major portion of their product to market. In fact, around 78% of oil shipments out of North Dakota are now being carried by pipelines, with the costly railroad share dropping from over 24% earlier in 2017 to less than 10%.Market players believe that the pipeline has helped in bettering the region’s drilling economics by lowering transportation costs for operators. Set to carry about 500,000 barrels of oil daily, or more than 50% of North Dakota’s output, the commencement of the Dakota Access Pipeline has bridged the gap between Bakken players and producers in other U.S. oil producing areas like the Williston and Permian basins.This, industry observers hope, will set the ball rolling for Bakken’s production revival and help producers like Continental Resources Inc. (CLR  -  Free Report) and EOG Resources Inc. (EOG  -  Free Report).Still Interested in Oil Stocks?Given the bearish oil pricing scenario, it shouldn't come as a surprise that most of the companies from this space are set to underperform in the near term. Furthermore, the Oil-Energy sector has a Zacks Sector Rankin the bottom 6% (15 out of 16), so there is little hope for a turnaround soon.

71,BHGE,"Offshore driller Diamond Offshore Drilling Inc. (DO  -  Free Report) recently concluded the offering of $500 million worth of senior notes, with an interest rate of 7.875%, due 2025.The company generated net cash flow of $489 million from the offering after deducting estimated costs and fees for underwriters. Diamond Offshore will likely utilize the proceeds along with cash balances for the redemption of outstanding senior notes, carrying an interest rate of 5.875%, expected to get matured by 2019.Investors should know that the business scenario of Houston, TX-based Diamond Offshore has improved substantially from 2016 as oil recovered from the lows of mid-February 2016. Drillers have started to gather on offshore plays again as per the latest rig count data provided by Houston-based oilfield service provider Baker Hughes, a GE company (BHGE  -  Free Report). Per the report, oil rig count jumped by three to 768. This shows that the rigs exploring for crude rose again after last week’s fall. Also, the current tally, though far off from the peak of 1,609 attained in October 2014, is significantly above the prior year’s count of 396.  The improving operating scenario is reflected in the last few earnings reports of the company.  Diamond Offshore managed to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 128.43%.Despite these improvements, the firm’s price chart is unimpressive. Over the last one year, Diamond Offshore fell 48.4% as compared with the 36.6% decline of the industry.As a result, the offshore driller carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

72,BHGE,"Drilling contractor Nabors Industries Ltd. (NBR  -  Free Report) recently announced plans to acquire Houston-based drilling player Tesco Corporation  to consolidate the oilfield services industry further.Why the Move?The oilfield services and drilling industry being one of the worst sufferers of oil slump had lowered mergers and acquisitions post 2014. Through the downturn period, energy companies remained focused on stabilizing their balance sheets and undertook various cost-cut initiatives.However, with the crude pricing witnessing a partial recovery from the lows associated with downturn, energy companies started inking various strategic deals to enhance their capabilities. With the markets starting to stabilize with the changing dynamics within the oil and gas sector, merger and acquisition deals have also been picking up in the oilfield services industry.Limited organic growth along with low volumes and weak margin expectations left the companies in the drilling and oilfield services industry primed for consolidation. The companies thus are focusing on accelerating M&A activities which not only complement their existing portfolios but also help to enhance their capabilities and competencies. Various M&A deals have been entered upon or completed in the last few months. These include Baker Hughes (BHGE  -  Free Report) - General Electric merger, Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report) - Summit ESP LLC merger and Trican Well Service Ltd - Canyon Services Group, Inc. merger among others.The recent news of amalgamation of Nabors – owner of the world's largest land-based drilling rig fleet – and Tesco which is noted for its technology-based solutions is likely to further reinforce Nabors position as the equipment and drilling services provider.Deal HighlightsThe acquisition will be an all stock transaction worth $215 million, wherein Nabors will purchase all the issued and outstanding shares of Tesco in exchange for 0.68 common shares of the former. The deal values Tesco’s stock at $4.62 reflecting a premium of about 19% on the Tesco’s closing price of $3.90 on Aug 11. The transaction value also represents a 30% premium of the total enterprise value of Tesco based on its cash balance as of Jun 30.  After the closure of the deal, which is expected to take place in the fourth quarter of 2017, upon necessary approvals and satisfactory conditions, shareholders of Tesco will own 10% of the shares of Nabors. However, if the deal fails to close by Feb 14, 2018, Tesco will be liable to pay Nabors a cash termination fee of $8 million.Expected SynergiesThe deal is a win-win transaction for the both the companies which is likely to result into various financial, commercial, and operating synergies.Nabors, which has a stretched balance sheet with a debt-to-capital ratio of over 55%, will be able to deleverage itself to certain extent by the issuance of shares for the acquisition of Tesco, which is free of debt as of Jun 30.Nabors Drilling Solutions unit will be benefited by Tesco’s tubular running services which are expected to provide Nabors with comprehensive solutions and integrated offerings. This in turn is likely to drive the revenues of the company and position it for increased benefits amid the rising oil production of late. Further, Nabors intends to synthesize its rig equipment subsidiary Canrig Drilling Technology Ltd. with Tesco’s equipment unit which is well noted for its product offerings and aftermarket service. This bodes well for the directional and horizontal drilling process of the company.The deal is expected to result into operating synergies of around $20 million in the first year followed by full run-rate synergies of $30-$35 million along with further capital savings. The acquisition will also provide Tesco an enhanced platform and scale thereby boost its potential for market share gains in the light of stronger and wider offering of complementary products and services.   Zacks Rack Barbados-based Nabors conducts oil, gas, and geothermal land drilling operations along with offering a number of ancillary well site services, including oilfield management, engineering, transportation, construction, maintenance, well logging, and other support services in select domestic and international markets. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

73,BHGE,"In its weekly release, Houston-based oilfield services Baker Hughes, a GE company (BHGE  -  Free Report) reported a rise in rigs searching for crude in the country while rigs for natural gas declined.  DetailsWeekly Summary: Rigs engaged in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas in the U.S. totaled 949 in the week ended Aug 11 – lower than the previous week’s 954. This shows that the total rig count in the country has declined for two weeks in a row.Since it hit an all-time low of 404 last May, rig count has been rising rapidly in American shale resources. Punctuated by a few pauses, the current nationwide rig count is considerably higher than the prior-year level of 481.For the week in discussion, the decline in rig count can be attributed to lower onshore activity (now at 928 compared to last week’s 934). However, units engaged in offshore operations increased slightly to 18 counts from 17 in the prior week.Oil Rig Count: Oil rig count jumped by three to 768. This emphasizes that the rigs exploring for crude rose again after last week’s fall. Also, the current tally, though far off from the peak of 1,609 attained in Oct 2014, is significantly above the previous year’s count of 396.   Natural Gas Rig Count: The natural gas rig count – which plunged to its lowest last August – inched down for the seventh time in 14 weeks to 181 (a fall of eight rigs from the previous week). Like oil, the count of rigs for gas exploration sits comfortably above the year-ago tally of 83. As per the most recent report, the number of natural gas-directed rigs is nearly 89% below the all-time high of 1,606 achieved in late summer 2008.Rig Count by Type: The number of vertical drilling rigs fell by one unit to 72, while the horizontal/directional rig count (encompassing new drilling technology that has the ability to drill and extract gas from dense rock formations, also known as shale formations) was down by six to 801.Gulf of Mexico (GoM): The GoM rig count went up to 17 units – 15 of which were oil-directed – from 16 counts.Details of the Weekly Rig CountBaker Hughes’ data, issued since 1944 at the end of every week, acts as an important yardstick for energy service providers in gauging the overall business environment of the oil and gas industry.Change in Baker Hughes’ rotary rig count heavily weighs on the demand for energy services – drilling, completion, production, etc. – provided by companies like Halliburton Co. (HAL  -  Free Report), Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB  -  Free Report), Weatherford International plc (WFT  -  Free Report), Diamond Offshore Drilling Inc. (DO  -  Free Report) and Transocean Ltd. (RIG  -  Free Report).ConclusionAlthough the number of rigs searching for natural gas in the U.S. declined from the prior week, the rig exploring for crude rose despite persistently weak oil prices. In other words, debt-laden shale drillers have proved that their operations are still profitable despite crude trading below the $50-per-barrel threshold.Let’s analyze the broader macro scenarios supporting shale players. OPEC and 11 non-OPEC players, including Russia, decided in the Vienna meeting on May 25, to extend the production cut deal until Mar 2018. Also, according to Saudi Arabia, there is a possibility of deeper production cut, if required, in the 173rd OPEC meeting on Nov 30, 2017. Thus, it is an ideal time for shale players to increase production at the expense of OPEC, especially because oil is trading way above the historical low of mid-February last year. No wonder, U.S. shale producers have again started gathering to oil patches as they aim to sell the commodity at higher prices.We should consider President Trump’s exit from Paris Climate accord as a factor encouraging drillers to continue pumping more oil. Now, it will be prudent to wait and watch whether shale drillers will continue to add rigs in oil resources.Zacks' 10-Minute Stock-Picking SecretSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.

74,BHGE,"Energy player Chesapeake Energy Corporation (CHK  -  Free Report) is slated to report second-quarter 2017 results on Aug 3, before the opening bell.In the preceding three-month period, the company reported a positive earnings surprise of 21.05%. Coming to the earnings surprise history, Chesapeake beat estimates in three of the last four quarters.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to the announcement.Earnings WhispersOur proven model shows that Chesapeake is likely to beat earnings because it has the perfect combination of two key ingredients.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is +7.14%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate stands at 15 cents, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged lower at 14 cents earnings. This is a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Chesapeake carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which when combined with positive Earnings ESP, makes us confident about an earnings beat.Note that stocks with Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings. Meanwhile, Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 and 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.Q2 Price PerformanceDuring the quarter, Chesapeake has lost 16.3% as compared to the 16.8% decline of the industry.Factors Likely to Affect EarningsThe crude pricing scenario over the first two months of second-quarter 2017 was way rosier than the year-ago period. Hopes of OPEC’s production cut deal extension was the prime factor driving the year-over-year hike in prices during April and almost the entire of May. Market anticipations proved somewhat correct as OPEC and 11 non-OPEC players, including Russia, decided to extend the production cut deal until Mar 2018 in the Vienna meeting.The same goes for natural gas as the average trading price of the commodity for each of the three months of the quarter was considerably better than the prior-year quarter. Thus, we can conclude that there was a modest recovery in natural gas prices during Q2 after the commodity hit its lowest annual average price during 2016 in almost 20 years.  We can say that the healthy commodity prices were favorable for the upstream business of the company. In fact, the rig count data provided by oilfield service firm Baker Hughes, a GE company (BHGE  -  Free Report) showed that for each week in second-quarter 2017, shale drillers kept on adding rigs in the oil patches reflecting increased exploration operations.Higher production of the commodities is likely to create more need for pipeline and storage infrastructures for transporting and storing the surplus output of oil and gas. Hence, the second quarter could prove favorable for Chesapeake’s midstream business as well.On top of that, the balance sheet looks healthy as reflected by the decline in long-term debt over the last three years.Other Stocks to ConsiderOther energy companies you may want to consider on the basis of our model, which shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Global Partners LP (GLP  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +60.00% and a Zacks Rank #1. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. The Williams Companies Inc (WMB  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +50.00% and a Zacks Rank #3.More Stock News: 8 Companies Verge on Apple-Like RunDid you miss Apple's 9X stock explosion after they launched their iPhone in 2007?

75,BHGE,"The second-quarter earnings season is picking up pace with several companies reporting financial results this week. In fact, as many as 117 S&P 500 members are set to release their quarterly results this week.So far, 171 S&P 500 members – 34.2% of the index’s total market capitalization – have reported second-quarter results. Per the Earnings Trends report, dated Jul 26, total earnings for these companies increased 8.8% on 3.4% growth in revenues, both on a year-over-year basis. While 78.9% companies beat earnings estimates, 70.8% posted better-than-expected revenues.We are in the thick of this earnings season, with more than 44% S&P 500 members expected to release numbers by the end of this week.At this stage, we don’t have too many results from the Energy sector.Energy Sector’s PerformanceLast year, Energy was the strongest S&P sector performer with a solid return of 24%. In particular, November's historic OPEC-led production cut deal managed to alleviate a supply glut to buoy oil prices and stabilize them around the psychologically important $50 per barrel threshold. The commodity was on a stellar run on optimism surrounding the agreement and the encouraging outlook for oil stocks.The seemingly positive developments encouraged investors to bet on firming prices for 2017, while the oil industry is pinning hopes on a turnaround. True to the strong sentiments, U.S. oil prices reached around $55 per barrel in late February, the highest in 19 months.However, the situation is strikingly different now, with the commodity floundering in recent weeks. By Jun 21, crude had shed more than 20% from its February highs and officially plunged into bear territory. In fact, prices declined 14.3% for the first half of the year,  registering the worst performance since 1998.Let's take a look at how oil and gas prices behaved during the second quarter of this year.The picture looks rather encouraging for the upcoming Q2 earnings season. This is not surprising, considering that oil and gas are both averaging higher compared with the second quarter of 2016 when the energy companies reported unusually low bottom line. While earnings for the Oil/Energy sector are set to scale a massive 271.4% – the highest year-over-year growth among all sectors – the top line is likely to show growth of 15.1% from second-quarter 2016 levels.Stocks to Watch for Earnings on Jul 28Let’s see what’s in store for four energy companies expected to come up with June quarter numbers on Jul 28.Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM  -  Free Report) is the world’s largest publicly traded oil company.Last quarter, the company reported earnings of 95 cents per share that beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 85 cents. The quarterly earnings also increased from 43 cents recorded a year ago. The company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the prior four quarters with an average positive earnings surprise of 1.46%.  Our proven model does not conclusively show that ExxonMobil will beat estimates this quarter. This is because ExxonMobil has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Conversely, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.

For the quarter to be reported, the company has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%, while it carries a Zacks Rank #3.

76,BHGE,"Shares of Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report) rose nearly 3% in pre-market trade, after the oilfield services behemoth reported better-than-expected second quarter profit thanks to improved utilization and pricing gains in North America.Halliburton’s adjusted income per share from continuing operation (excluding special items) came in at 23 cents, above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 19 cents – the twelfth consecutive quarterly outperformance. Moreover, revenues of $4,957 million missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4,844 million.Oil services companies (like Halliburton) – providers of technical products and services to drillers of oil and gas wells – are generally the first of the U.S. energy firms to kick off an earnings season. While the world’s biggest oilfield services company Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB  -  Free Report) came out with Jun numbers on Friday, Jul 21, the remaining two of the so-called Big Four oilfield service and equipment providers – Baker Hughes, a GE company (BHGE  -  Free Report) and Weatherford International plc (WFT  -  Free Report) – report second quarter earnings over the next few days.Halliburton Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Halliburton Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Halliburton Company QuoteNorth American Market Continues to Gather StrengthAlong the results, Halliburton also sounded optimistic in its view that the North American land market is improving rapidly, driven by increased utilization and pricing - particularly for pressure pimping. As it is, rig counts have generally been rising during the last one year since plunging to an all-time low of 404 in May 2016, with the addition of a flood of new units. As a proof of the recovery, Halliburton grew its domestic land revenue by nearly 25% sequentially, ahead of the U.S. land rig count growth of 21%Additionally, the international market seems to have bottomed out, with regional sales rising 7% from the first quarter on heightened Latin American activity, together with increased well completion and drilling services in Europe and Africa. However, pricing pressure continued with the slowdown in Middle East stimulation services. Segmental PerformanceOperating income from the Completion and Production segment was $397 million, turning around from the year-ago loss of $32 million and the previous quarter’s income of $147 million, helped by strong pressure pumping activity and improved pricing in the U.S. land market.But Halliburton’s Drilling and Evaluation unit profit dropped – from $154 million in the second quarter of 2016 to $125 million this year and was only marginally ahead of the $122 million earned in the Mar quarter. The setback was on account of pricing pressure, partly offset by higher drilling activity in Mexico, Venezuela, and Colombia, a seasonal rebound in the North Sea and Russia, plus increased fluid services in Asia Pacific.Balance SheetHalliburton’s capital expenditure in the second quarter was $327 million.As of Jun 31, 2017, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company had approximately $2,139 million in cash/cash equivalents and $10,816 million in long-term debt, representing a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 54.7%.

77,BHGE,"Oilfield service giant Schlumberger Limited’s (SLB  -  Free Report) second-quarter 2017 earnings of 35 cents per share (excluding charges and credits) beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 30 cents and the year-ago figure of 23 cents.  The company reported total revenue of $7,462 million, which improved from the year-earlier level of $7,164 million and also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7,258 million.The strong results were driven by a rebound in drilling activities in Russia and the North Sea. Higher demand for directional drilling techniques, especially in the domestic onshore market, also supported the numbers.Schlumberger is the first among the “Big Four” oilfield service and equipment providers to release its quarterly results. The other players – Baker Hughes, a GE company (BHGE  -  Free Report), Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report) and Weatherford International plc (WFT  -  Free Report) – will report second-quarter results next week.Segmental PerformanceEach of the groups – Reservoir Characterization, Drilling Group and Production Group – registered a year-over-year increase in revenues.Drilling Group revenues increased primarily on contributions from the international market. Rebound in seasonal works in Russia and the North Sea contributed to growth. Higher demand for directional drilling techniques, especially in the domestic onshore market, also supported the top line. However, the positives were partially negated by reduced operations related to the offshore market in the Gulf of Mexico.Results at the Production Group were positively impacted by higher hydraulic fracturing work in the domestic land market. Pricing recovery in the North American land areas, improved unconventional land works in Argentina along with higher activities in China and Russia were also led to the improvement. Meanwhile, a decrease in production at the SPM Shushufindi development partially offset the positives.The Reservoir Characterization segment was supported by strong contributions from the international market. Surge in sales of WesternGeco multiclient seismic license along with higher contributions from drillstem test operations in the UAE led to better results. Higher wireline revenues from the North Sea and Russia also favored the business unit.  Reservoir Characterization: This group posted revenues of $1,759 million as against $1,586 million in the prior-year quarter. Pre-tax operating income was $299 million, up 12% year over year. Drilling Group: Revenues of $2,107 million rose 4% year over year. Pre-tax operating income was $302 million, up 77% year over year.Production Group: Revenues recorded by this group increased 18% from the year-earlier quarter to $2,496 million. Pre-tax operating income skyrocketed 170% year over year to $221 million.Cameron Group: This segment generated revenues of $1,265 million, down 17% year over year.

Meanwhile, the energy sector is likely to outperform the rest with year-over-year earnings growth of 276.2%. This will also mark a massive improvement from the last quarter‘s staggering earnings decline of 654.8%.Research shows that during Q2, the Oil/Energy sector will likely generate quarterly earnings of $10.7 billion, much higher than $4.4 billion recorded during the April-to-June quarter of 2016.
