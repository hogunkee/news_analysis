0,ADM,"In politically driven moods, the ancient Romans often wiped from history all mention of a prior hero or celebrity. They called such erasures damnatio memoriae. The Soviet Union likewise airbrushed away, or “Trotskyized,” all the images of any past kingpin who became politically incorrect.The Obama administration seems obsessed with doing the same to retired Gen. David Petraeus.Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter is now thinking of retroactively taking away one or two of Petraeus’ four stars. The potential demotion in rank, opposed by the Army, is intended as further punishment for the misdemeanor to which he pleaded guilty last year.Petraeus accepted two years of probation and paid a $100,000 fine for allowing his mistress, Paula Broadwell, to read classified information for research on the biography she was writing about Petraeus.Carter apparently wants to ensure that Petraeus is treated the same fashion as other miscreant generals and admirals who have lost rank. Yet there is no evidence that Broadwell (who enjoyed a military security clearance of her own) ever shared the classified information with anyone or disclosed it in the biography.That does not excuse the bad judgment of Petraeus. But it does invite an obvious comparison with former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. She not only sent classified information over her unsecured email to several individuals, but remains untruthful about that fact.To this day, we still do not know how many people received classified information via Clinton's emails, or whether hackers tapped into her non-approved private server. By any sense of commensurability, the Obama Justice Department should charge Clinton in the fashion it did Petraeus.If she goes free, the Obama administration confirms the suspicion that there are no longer any security laws for government officials -- particularly when they are powerful and their politics agree with the president's.Petraeus was not just any four-star general. He was the most effective and talented American general since Gen. Matthew Ridgway, who saved what appeared to be a lost Korean War. Petraeus and his team promoted the so-called “surge” of troops into Iraq, and enlisted tens of thousands of Iraqis to join the American effort to defeat radical terrorists and insurrectionists.Petraeus’ efforts saved Iraq -- and thousands of American and Iraqi lives. Barack Obama entered office in 2009 with a mostly quiet Iraq. Petraeus’ legacy explains why Vice President Joe Biden claimed Iraq as possibly one of the administration’s “greatest achievements.” Obama himself boasted in late 2011 that he was pulling out all U.S. forces from a “sovereign, stable and self-reliant” Iraq.That claim was true -- until Obama’s politically driven skedaddle from Iraq created a vacuum to be filled by Islamic State terrorists.Practically, it might not be wise for Obama to humiliate Petraeus, thereby revisiting the circumstances of the general's strange exit from the Obama administration.The media have rarely noted that the administration learned of Petraeus’ imbroglio sometime in summer of 2012, right in the middle of the Obama re-election campaign. Yet Petraeus’ sudden, unexpected resignation as CIA director came just three days after Obama's re-election.What exactly the CIA was doing in Libya, and what happened in Benghazi, are likewise murky.The current puritanical frenzy with regard to our military is sacrificing battlefield talent. We never would have won World War II had we shared the administration's present obsessions.The hard-drinking and womanizing Adm. Ernest King was the architect of the brilliant comeback of the U.S. Navy, which had been crippled at Pearl Harbor. Less than four years later under King, it utterly destroyed the Imperial Japanese Navy.Gen. George S. Patton in 1943 slapped two soldiers in Sicily whom he thought were slackers, but who were probably ill. Yet the reprimanded Patton’s career was ultimately salvaged. He went on to save tens of thousands of American lives in Europe with his audacious armored drives and often brilliant encirclements.Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower quite possibly had an affair with his chauffeur, Kay Summersby, in the midst of overseeing the Normandy operations. Should we now strip the long-dead Eisenhower of his fifth star, given that he may well have discussed confidential information with Summersby while overseeing an army of 2 million?Iconic Gen. Douglas MacArthur carried on an affair with an underaged Filipina actress, Isabel Rosario Cooper, while he was top U.S. commander in the Philippines in 1930. Should MacArthur have been relieved of duty before he led a Pacific offensive that liberated the Philippines from Japanese occupation?Petraeus has lost his reputation. He resigned his job as CIA director. He pled guilty to a misdemeanor. He was fined. He was put on probation. Enough is enough. It is time to move on for an administration that threw away a stable Iraq -- once saved by the man it still hounds.

1,ADM,"American Decline: U.S. naval intelligence warns in detail of a ""new technologically advanced Russian navy"" that's to return Moscow ""to clear great power status."" No Reaganesque U.S. response seems likely.A 68-page report from the Office of Naval Intelligence this month, ""The Russian Navy: A Historic Transition,"" should scare the American public the way that the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan of exactly 36 years ago did.Chances are, the people will never even hear about it.""The new, technologically advanced Russian navy, increasingly armed with the Kalibr family of weapons, will be able to more capably defend the maritime approaches to the Russian Federation and exert significant influence in adjacent seas,"" the report states.In October, Russian vessels launched 26 Kalibr-class supersonic cruise missiles, which flew more than 900 miles over Iran and Iraq to 11 anti-Assad and Islamic State targets within Syria. (Four reportedly crashed.) Moscow launched another 18 Kalibr cruise missiles last month at Syrian targets, and more this month.This ""very low-flying, fast missile"" — as retired Adm. Eric McVadon, formerly U.S. naval attache in Beijing, once described it — can perform sharp-angled escapes and other advanced maneuvers shortly before reaching its target, a naval intelligence manual states. It could sink U.S. aircraft carriers. Chinese submarines have their own version of the missile.""This multipurpose force,"" the report continues, will ""provide a flexible platform for Russia to demonstrate offensive capability, threaten neighbors, project power regionally and advance President Putin's stated goal of returning Russia to clear great power status.""The report notes numerous specific naval construction projects with short-term time frames for completion:• ""Dolgorukiy nuclear-powered ballistic submarine (SSBN) class . .. eight units by the end of 2020.""• Severodvinsk fourth-generation multipurpose nuclear attack submarine: ""Eight are planned to be built through 2020.""• ""Grigorovich-class FFGS Guided Missile Frigate ... six Grigorovich units were expected to be in the Black Sea by 2020.""And don't expect any 900-ruble toilet seats.""In the post-Soviet era, the Russian government has taken a more cost-effective approach to military procurement in an attempt to find and cut waste, fraud and embezzlement of procurement funds,"" the naval analysis notes. ""Significant steps have been taken to ensure that the defense procurement ruble results in a 'ruble's worth' of equipment.""Putin also seems determined to arm others with high-tech naval weapons. The report warns of ""arms traffic from Russia to many non-peer foreign actors,"" remarking, ""This proliferation of high-grade weapons is one of the most troubling aspects of Russian Federation adventurism worldwide.""To defend against our own cruise missiles, Russia also seeks a laser-like ""high-energy weapon with antisatellite and cruise missile defense capability."" And ""electro-dynamic gun systems are being developed that use electrical energy.""Meanwhile, China too is expanding its number of submarines and advanced guided-missile warships, as the U.S. Navy reported in April.Does anyone imagine that, even under a Republican president, with the massive welfare state that America must now sustain, the public will agree to the kind of Reaganesque military revitalization required to oppose the new Russian threat?In the third 2012 debate, GOP nominee Mitt Romney warned that President Obama would shrink the Navy. Obama quipped, ""We also have fewer horses and bayonets."" Many believe that Obama won the election right then and there.It's comforting to believe, as Obama taunted, that ""the 1980s are now calling to ask for their foreign policy back because, you know, the Cold War's been over for 20 years.""By all signs, it's coming back in less than five years.

25,ADM,"Al-Qaida: How much does President Obama still want the Guantanamo Bay terrorist prison shuttered? He just released the man trained to be the 20th hijacker for the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks.In May, 2008, Rear Adm. David M. Thomas, then-commander of the Joint Task Force at Guantanamo Bay, sent a memo marked secret to the commander of the U.S. Southern Command recommending continued detention for Abdul Rahman Shalabi, who has just been released to Saudi Arabia by the Obama administration.Here are just some of the things the declassified memo said: ""Detainee (Shalabi) is a member of al-Qaida and a long-term bodyguard for Usama Bin Laden (UBL), serving in that position beginning in 1999."" ""Detainee received specialized close combat training for his role as a suicide operative in an aborted component of the 11 September 2001 al-Qaida attacks."" ""Detainee participated in hostilities against U.S. and Coalition forces and was captured with a group referred to as the Dirty 30, which included UBL bodyguards and an assessed 20th 11 September 2001 hijacker."" ""Detainee received advanced training at multiple al-Qaida camps."" ""Detainee also has familial ties to UBL and has demonstrated his hatred for Americans at JTFGTMO (Gitmo) and will likely reestablish ties to al-Qaida and other extremist elements if released."" ""A HIGH risk, as he is likely to pose a threat to the U.S., its interests and allies."" ""A HIGH threat from a detention perspective."" ""Of HIGH intelligence value."" ""His overall behavior has been mostly noncompliant and hostile to the guard force and staff. He currently has 95 Reports of Disciplinary Infraction listed in DIMS with the most recent occurring on 27 February 2008, when he was reported spitting on the guard force."" ""Detainee has 11 Reports of Disciplinary Infraction for assault with the most recent occurring on 27 February 2008, when he was reported spitting on the guard force."" ""Other incidents for which he has been disciplined include inciting and participating in mass disturbances, failure to follow guard instructions and camp rules, inappropriate use of bodily fluids, unauthorized communications, damage to government property, attempted assaults, assaults, provoking words and gestures, and possession of food and nonweapon type contraband."" ""On 7 August 2005, detainee was reported to be in possession of broken glass (shank).""This is the terrorist prisoner President Obama is releasing, believing he will be rehabilitated in a program in his native Saudi Arabia where 12% of the subjects ultimately return to terrorist activities.Shalabi was bodyguard to Osama bin Laden himself, as well as trained to take part in the Sept. 11, 2001, suicide attacks.He was also on a partial hunger strike for nine years at Gitmo, and will undoubtedly be used in Islamist propaganda against U.S. detention policies once he returns to his home.No wonder Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., described the release of ""this dangerous detainee"" as ""another example of President Obama playing politics with national security and putting campaign promises ahead of U.S. national security interests.""A high-ranking al-Qaida member who hates America so much that again and again he assaulted our guards at Gitmo, including spitting and using bodily fluids, and who apparently planned to attack them with broken glass.Does that sound like someone who is going to be rehabilitated in Saudi Arabia? Or someone who will be returning to the terrorist battlefield to wage jihad against America?

26,ADM,"James Stavridis had no plans to stay in the U.S. Navy, let alone become an admiral. Originally, his goal was to become a Marine officer, like his father, learn leadership skills and switch to a corporate law career.In 1981, as his post-Naval Academy five-year commitment was ending, he applied to top law schools.Then Lt. Cmdr. Mike Mullen, the future chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and a mentor, called.He recommended that instead of getting stuck with a huge law school bill, Stavridis should accept a scholarship Mullen could arrange to the Fletcher School of Law & Diplomacy at Tufts University in Medford, Mass.This would require only a three-year service commitment.Stavridis agreed — and the military remained his life, all the way to becoming the first admiral in charge of NATO forces.Now he's dean of Fletcher.""Everyone should keep an open mind about career goals and seek advice from those who might know your potential better than you do,"" Stavridis, the author of ""The Accidental Admiral,"" told IBD. ""I never dreamed I would spend 37 years in uniform and become a four-star admiral.""Florida RiseStavridis, 60, was born in West Palm Beach, Fla., and graduated from the academy at Annapolis, Md., in 1976. By then, he had changed course and become a surface ship warfare officer.One of his first managerial jobs was heading an engineering department, where the sailors worked long hours in hot and dirty conditions far below the top deck.""The successful officer will be able to make his people feel privileged,"" he wrote in his chapter of ""Naval Leadership,"" edited by Thomas Cutler. ""He makes them believe in themselves, and the simplest way to do that is to believe in them himself.""In 1983, Stavridis earned a master's degree in law and diplomacy from Fletcher and the next year a Ph.D. in international relations.""This helped me learn that the world was a diverse place and there were no single silver bullet solutions for its problems, so you have to work with allies and partners, communicating strategically to create answers that would endure,"" he said.During his postgraduate days he married Laura Hall, who also came from a Navy family and had a degree in international relations. She would go on to do her own advanced studies at Boston University. They have two daughters, Julia and Christina, with the family usually based at Norfolk, Va., while he was often away for months.After rising in the ranks, he landed a big break in 1993, when he took command of the Barry, a new, billion-dollar destroyer.Halfway through his tour, it became the first destroyer to include women, who made up 15% of the 340 sailors. Stavridis recounted his experience in 2007's ""Destroyer Captain,"" amid his sideline of articles that reached 150 and command handbook contributions.Meanwhile, the Barry took Stavridis and his crew 130,000 miles to enforce an arms embargo on Haiti and Serbia, search for Iraqi mines in the Persian Gulf, practice anti-submarine warfare and conduct military exercises — while avoiding frequent hurricanes.Also with Stavridis at the helm, the Barry won the Battenberg Cup as the best-run ship among the 150 vessels in the Atlantic Fleet in 1995.Stavridis has always been a big reader and most mornings devours news, blogs and opinions in English, French and Spanish.A believer in continuous learning and getting different viewpoints, he includes in his ""Accidental Admiral"" a reading list that runs 20 pages and emphasizes ""the importance of the lessons of history.""Among his favorites: Edward Luttwak's ""The Grand Strategy of the Roman Empire."" ""The Struggle for Mastery in Europe: 1848-1918"" by A.J.P. Taylor. ""No Simple Victory: World War II in Europe"" by Norman Davies. ""Winning the Peace: The Marshall Plan and America's Coming of Age as a Superpower"" by Nicolaus Mills.Stavridis writes of the pivotal Battle of Salamis near Athens in 480 B.C. between the small Greek fleet under Themistocles and the vast array of vessels under Persian King Xerxes.""Themistocles told his captains the night before to remember to tell the men of the galleys that they rowed first for their parents, then for their children, their city and finally for their freedom,"" said Stavridis. ""Attitude and training were more important than numbers, and they were victorious, enabling the first democracies to thrive and inspire our Founding Fathers.""In 1998, Stavridis took command of Destroyer Squadron 21 in the Persian Gulf and received the John Paul Jones Award for inspirational leadership.After running the Navy's first think tank about the 9/11 attacks, he returned to the Persian Gulf in 2002-04 to direct combat operations of the aircraft carrier Enterprise's strike group during the Afghan and Iraq wars.He's reticent about the details, only saying, ""There's a thrill to launching a Tomahawk missile.""GlobalIn 2006 he became the first admiral of U.S. Southern Command out of Miami, vaulting him on trips to 45 countries with 500 million people. ""I worked with Admiral Stavridis as he transformed Southern Command into a model of smart power that uses interagency and private-public relationships in innovative ways that address the multifaceted challenges of the 21st century strategic environment,"" said retired Army Col. Jorge Silveira, who served as his Commander's Action Group chief. ""He put on a full-court press to create a joint command by inviting 15 U.S. government agencies to send representatives to integrate with our headquarters. Among the results was a hospital ship that sailed to countries in the region and saved lives as it supported theater security objectives. His proudest moment was when we helped the Colombia military rescue three American hostages who had been held for over five years by narcoterrorists.""Next up for Stavridis, in 2009, was head of U.S. European Command in Stuttgart, Germany, overseeing 100,000 military members.Simultaneously, he commanded 120,000 NATO forces from 51 countries, with headquarters in Mons, Belgium.He was the first admiral in the post after 15 Army and Air Force generals, starting with Dwight Eisenhower in 1950.Stavridis made Silveira his military assistant, and they soon faced crises from piracy off the Horn of Africa to the civil war in Syria.Facing The Enemy""We worked hard to raise the 10,000 allied troops to add to the 30,000 Americans for the Afghanistan surge in 2010, doing everything from trading off desires of certain nations for specific missions to giving speeches, and the effort succeeded,"" Stavridis said.The next year, he oversaw U.S. and NATO attacks against Libya's dictator, Moammar Gadhafi, ending 222 days later after 24,000 air and missile strikes and 3,000 intercepts at sea.His third big preoccupation was the former Yugoslavia, where NATO had bombed Serb aggressors in Bosnia-Herzegovina in 1995, then in Kosovo in 1999.At the campaign's peak, 60,000 peacekeeping troops were in Kosovo. By the time Stavridis stepped down, 5,000 remained.""My biggest disappointment in my four-year tour was our inability to build a better working relationship with the Russians,"" Stavridis said. ""By far my saddest responsibility was having to write 2,400 letters of condolence"" for the loved ones of those serving NATO in Afghanistan and elsewhere.In ""The Accidental Admiral,"" Stavridis recommends ways for leaders to be more effective: Prepare for key events. Be your own spokesman. Spend a quarter of your time on personnel matters, from mentoring to meeting new people. Enjoy relaxing weekends. Stay physically fit.His 2012 TED Talk, ""A Navy Admiral's Thoughts on Global Security,"" viewed nearly 700,000 times, digs into the use of smart power, integrating military action with diplomacy, humanitarian aid and other resources to achieve goals.In 2013, he retired from the Navy and became dean at Fletcher.His personal awards include the Defense Distinguished Service Medal, the Navy Distinguished Service Medal, the Defense Superior Service Medal and the Legion of Merit with four stars.

27,ADM,"Corn futures fell to a seven-week low and soybeans plunged the most in six years after the U.S. unexpectedly raised its crop forecasts, citing higher yields than anticipated.The corn harvest will be 13.686 billion bushels compared with 13.53 billion projected in July, the Agriculture Department said Wednesday.The soybean outlook also exceeded expectations.The government report surprised investors because the crop year began with record June rain in Illinois, Indiana and Ohio, washing away newly sown crops.Corn futures for December delivery fell 5% to close at $3.68 a bushel at 1:20 p.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade.The price touched $3.575, the lowest for a most-active contract since June 22.Soybean futures for November delivery slid 6% to $9.1325 a bushel, the biggest drop since July 7, 2009.Larger supplies of corn may reduce costs for ethanol refiners such as Archer-Daniels-Midland (ADM) and Valero Energy (VLO) and meat producers such as Tyson Foods (TSN), which buys grain for livestock feed.Shares of farm equipment makers fell on the news. Deere (DE), the largest tractor manufacturer, dropped 3%. AGCO (AGCO) slid 4%.""This supply shock is more bad news for farm incomes,"" said Steve Nicholson, a vice president of food and agriculture research at Rabo AgriFinance in St. Louis.

28,ADM,"Iran Deal: At least 214 former generals and admirals signed a letter warning that President Obama's Iran nuclear pact could bring war. It counters less than a quarter of that number publicly supporting the deal.President Obama claims that the opponents of his surrender to Iran are neocon warmongers, ""the same people who argued for the war in Iraq.""But the 214 and counting retired military brass who signed an open letter to the leaders of both parties in the two houses of Congress, urging rejection of the agreement, belie that claim. And their emergence upends a previous letter supporting the deal, signed by a fraction of this number of generals.One of the signatories of that earlier letter, retired Joint Chiefs member Marine Gen. James Cartwright, was close to Obama and is now the subject of a federal investigation into whether he leaked national security secrets to the media.Those signing the letter opposing the deal include Air Force Gen. Lance Smith, a decorated combat fighter pilot who was NATO's Supreme Allied Commander for Transformation; Air Force Gen. James Davis, who was chief of staff for the Supreme Headquarters of the Allied Powers, Europe; and the organizer of the letter, decorated Navy combat aviator and former vice chief of naval operations, Adm. Leon ""Bud"" Edney.Their missive blasts virtually everything that Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry assert about the consequences of the deal.""Removing sanctions on Iran and releasing billions of dollars to its regime over the next ten years is inimical to the security of Israel and the Middle East,"" the 214 generals and admirals argue.Contrary to the assertion by the president that the deal cuts off ""every pathway"" that Tehran could take to become a nuclear weapons power, the ex-brass point out that even if the terrorist regime doesn't cheat, Tehran gets to keep ""all the infrastructure the Iranians need for a nuclear bomb to be preserved and enhanced . .. Iran is allowed to: continue to enrich uranium; develop and test advanced centrifuges; and continue work on its Arak heavy-water plutonium reactor.""The deal's ""unverifiable"" inspection scheme is ""under such severe limitations as to prevent"" inspectors ""from reliably protecting Iranian cheating,"" with the United Nations' International Atomic Energy Agency denied access ""to Iranian military facilities, the most likely location of their nuclear weapons development efforts.""The letter's signers also raise a key matter that has been little raised in the debate on the pact: the compromise of U.S. secrets in the process of enforcing the agreement.They argue, ""There is substantial risk of U.S. intelligence being compromised, since the IAEA often relies on our sensitive data with respect to suspicious and/or prohibited activity.""One top of the at least $150 billion that Tehran will have to expand its terrorist activities in the region, the generals' letter notes that the deal ""will lift international embargoes on Iran's access to advanced conventional weapons and ballistic missile technology.""Rather than provide the opportunity for Iran to begin a process of becoming a more normal, civilized country, as the administration suggests, the letter says, ""The agreement will enable Iran to become far more dangerous, render the Mideast still more unstable and introduce new threats to American interests as well as our allies.""They write that rather than prevent war, the agreement ""makes it likely that the war the Iranian regime has waged against us since 1979 will continue, with far higher risks to our national security interests.""Plainly, as the military officials suggest, the so-called deal with Iran to curb its nuclear weapons program is a travesty, one that endangers America and its allies.The Obama surrender isn't a choice between war and peace. As these 214 generals and admirals state, it's between the current jihad and an unthinkable nuclear jihad.

29,ADM,"War On Terror: The U.S. Central Command apparently embellished intelligence reports to make it appear that we're winning our war against the Islamic State. Have top brass been intimidated into Obama lapdogs?America would obviously stop being America if the military were not subordinate to our elected leaders. But what about the flip side of the equation, as when an administration cows elements of our armed forces into such submission, they pretend a president's misguided military strategy is working when it's failing?The New York Times reports that the Pentagon's inspector general has launched an investigation into whether officials at CENTCOM, which oversees our efforts against the Islamic State, ""were improperly reworking the conclusions of intelligence assessments prepared for policy makers, including President Obama,"" according to several government officials who spoke to the Times anonymously.The CENTCOM officials' apparent motive was ""to provide a more optimistic account of progress,"" the paper reported.The seriousness of this should not be taken lightly. This is something an enemy of the U.S. would want to do: make our leaders think we were winning a war when we are actually losing it.Months or years could be spent pursuing the wrong course against IS — in this case, perhaps, concluding that a U.S.-led ground war is not necessary. Then, when discovery is finally made that we've been on the wrong course, IS may have consolidated its control over vast territories. Or it may have grown strong and stable enough to refocus on attacking U.S. targets outside and within our homeland.Part of what is behind this is clearly the terror this administration has struck into the heart of our military brass, with President Obama firing numerous generals — and not just in cases of public criticism of his administration, as when Gen. Stanley McChrystal was forced to resign as commander of our forces in Afghanistan, after which Obama prematurely withdrew the U.S. from our mission there.The Blaze's Sara Carter has reported on what retired generals and current senior commanders described to her as a ""purge"" of those who oppose Obama's reduction of the nation's status as a superpower.They include Army Gen. Carter Hamm, the U.S. African Command chief, who was outraged that reinforcements were not sent to Benghazi, and Rear Adm. Charles Gaouette, in charge of aircraft carriers in the Mediterranean during the Benghazi assault, who told Congress his aircraft could have been sent to help U.S. personnel.Even more prominent, of course, was the abrupt departure of four-star Gen. James ""Mad Dog"" Mattis, CENTCOM commander from 2010 to 2013, who has become a fierce critic of Obama's defense policies, and who may have been asked to leave for his criticism of Obama's approach to Iran.We know who in the military does well under Obama — generals like departing Joint Chiefs Chairman Martin Dempsey, who publicly backed the president's refusal to intervene in Syria by claiming it was too risky militarily, and cheerleading the misguided Obama strategy against IS.Military brass have a special obligation in their oath to ""support and defend the Constitution against all enemies."" They must be truthful and candid to those civilians whom the American people have placed in authority over them.If we are losing a war, it may not always be in the interests of the nation for failures to be revealed to the public, but the president and Congress certainly must be informed by our generals and admirals of the relevant shortcomings.Today, we apparently have too many of high rank who fear being purged by a politically-motivated commander in chief as much as they fear losing on the battlefield. A victorious and emboldened IS may be the consequence.

30,ADM,"In 1854, British navy Capt. Robert FitzRoy had a big idea: Collect information on the weather, and you could warn ships to avoid storms and save lives.But no one believed weather could be predicted. When a friend advocated FitzRoy's idea in Parliament, FitzRoy was made a joke — until he had the last laugh.He developed evidence for five years, when he was able to show that a steamer that sank with 500 passengers could have been warned to avoid the tempest.""FitzRoy's ethic could be distilled into the phrase 'take action!' "" Peter Moore, author of ""The Weather Experiment,"" told IBD. ""His success was all about seizing the initiative, seeing opportunities before others and acting positively. These instincts were forged in his youth by the stories of Admiral Horatio Nelson's daring tactics that made the Royal Navy the most powerful in the world.""Far ahead of his time, FitzRoy laid the foundation for what he termed ""weather forecasting.""English RiseFitzRoy (1805-65) was born in Ampton in southeast England to an aristocratic family with a tradition of public service. His father, Lord Charles FitzRoy, was the great-grandson of King Charles II.In 1819, at 13, Robert joined the navy. The next year, he embarked on a voyage to South America, during which he was promoted to midshipman. In 1824, he took the exam to become a lieutenant and passed with a perfect score.In 1828, FitzRoy was appointed to the staff of Rear Adm. Walter Otway on the Ganges, a frigate stationed around South America. Later that year, he was made captain of the sloop Beagle after its commander committed suicide.By the time of his return to England after two years, he had established a reputation as a solid leader and surveyor of coastlines.""The captain's job was to ensure that all orders he received were carried out to the best ability of the men under him, which required a great deal of initiative, with communications limited to seaborne dispatches received at long and irregular intervals,"" wrote John and Mary Gribbin in ""FitzRoy."" ""This also required the exercise of absolute authority to ensure that his own orders were obeyed without question. Even a popular captain like FitzRoy was in some ways a remote figure, with almost godlike powers within the ship.""In 1831 he got the Beagle ready to sail. Meanwhile, he asked a friend to find a companion with scientific interests to make the planned five-year voyage more enjoyable.Enter Charles Darwin.Upon his friend's recommendation, FitzRoy gave Darwin the first volume of Charles Lyell's ""Principles of Geology,"" which made the argument that Earth's features were the outcome of a marathon process.They became lifelong friends.""Darwin learned the meticulous methods of work, which were to characterize his later life, from FitzRoy,"" wrote the Gribbins.One of the natives that FitzRoy brought to England died from a smallpox vaccination. The Beagle placed the other three on a Tierra del Fuego island to set up a missionary post in January 1833. It was soon looted, and they returned to their native lifestyle.The Beagle sailed around the tip of South America into the Pacific and up the western coast, then went 600 miles west of Ecuador to the Galapagos Islands.There, Darwin found that birds and tortoises had developed differences once the same species were separated. This insight sparked his theory of evolution.FitzRoy and Darwin went on to Tahiti, New Zealand, Australia and South Africa, with FitzRoy mapping the route and Darwin collecting rocks, plants and animals.From South Africa they crossed the southern Atlantic to Brazil to recheck longitude measurements, then headed home, arriving in England in 1836.Soon after landing, FitzRoy married Mary O'Brien, the daughter of a major general, and they would have four children.The Royal Geographical Society awarded FitzRoy a gold medal for his coastal surveys. Then in 1839, his report on the voyage was published in four volumes, which included Darwin's notes.Darwin's points on evolution shook FitzRoy's belief in the biblical account of a 40-day flood and six-day creation. And under Mary's influence, FitzRoy became more committed to a literal interpretation, which asserted that if Earth's creation didn't take place in six days, the Bible would be wrong and there was no God.Subsequently, he felt guilty for helping develop the theory of evolution, announced with the 1859 publication of Darwin's ""On the Origin of Species,"" which contradicted the Bible.In 1841, FitzRoy was elected a Tory member of Parliament. Two years later he was appointed governor of New Zealand and devoted himself to protecting the native Maori from settlers' illegal land claims. His actions made political enemies; he was recalled in 1845.Back In BritainIn 1848, he became superintendent of the Royal Naval Dockyards in Woolwich, then had his last sea command and retired in 1850.The next year, with Darwin's support, he was elected to the Royal Society, a distinguished fellowship of scientists. In 1854, he became head of a new meteorological department of the Board of Trade to collect weather data at sea.Also that year, FitzRoy married his distant cousin Maria Smyth, his first wife having died two years earlier, and they would have one daughter.He arranged with hundreds of captains to provide information with reliable instruments that he supplied. He designed a barometer that could determine whether storms were coming and was able to telegraph warnings to fishing villages and vessels that could receive messages.In 1854, FitzRoy became head of the British Board of Trade's Meteorological Department, today called the Meteorological Office.""FitzRoy's efforts were part of one of the most notorious and daring scientific projects of the 19th century,"" said Moore. ""There had been no accurate way for the navy to measure winds, no one could explain clouds, nor was there an understanding of what a storm actually was. Some thought the weather was influenced by the planets or that gales were God's punishment of sinners.""In 1857, FitzRoy revived his naval career and rose to rear admiral. Two years later, the steamer Royal Charter arrived off the western port of Anglesey, Wales, where it sank in a storm. Only 41 of about 500 aboard survived the disaster, which FitzRoy argued could have been prevented through weather forecasting. As it was, his warnings to other ships had saved hundreds of lives.Catching OnFitzRoy had finally gained traction. In 1861, Times of London began publishing daily weather forecasts based on his information.In 1863 he published ""The Weather Book,"" despite guffaws from rivals. FitzRoy was promoted to vice admiral the same year, but became depressed by internal turmoil in the navy, attacks by critics, his declining health and rising debt, having spent his fortune to help the public with forecasting.He died two years later at 59.When newspapers reported that his wife and daughter were left destitute, the government gave them today's equivalent $400,000, and Queen Victoria let them live at Hampton Court Palace.""FitzRoy's work was so revolutionary and he propelled his department so far ahead of his time that he sparked a scientific crisis,"" said Moore. ""Rivals disputed his achievements after his death, changed the focus of the department and canceled the storm warnings, despite the protests of fishermen. But a study showed he had been accurate 75% of the time and the warnings were resumed in a simplified form in 1874, with full forecasts five years later.""In 1871, the U.S. Army's new Weather Bureau began sending out ""probabilities"" of weather changes based on telegraphed reports as appreciation grew for how conditions could hit operations.When the Taliban took over Afghanistan in 1996, they banned weather forecasting as a form of sorcery. That gave the U.S. Air Force an advantage before the invasion of 2001, when it sent in an advance team of special operations weather technicians called the Gray Berets. They also guided the Navy SEALS as they arrived in Pakistan to take down Osama bin Laden in 2011.Many call FitzRoy the father of weather science. His Meteorological Office continues, and everyone takes the daily forecast for granted in making plans.

31,ADM,"Superpower In Decline: North Korea's nuclear-armed dictator Kim Jong-un announced his forces are in a ""quasi-state of war"" as they fire artillery into South Korea. Behind it are doubts of U.S. resolve.Just months before Communist North Korean troops invaded South Korea in the summer of 1950, beginning the Korean War in which over 36,000 Americans gave their lives, Secretary of State Dean Acheson let it be known that the Koreas were outside America's ""defense perimeter.""No one in the Obama administration may have made a statement projecting such provocative weakness directly in Pyongyang's direction. But actions speak louder than words, and with our withdrawals from Iraq and Afghanistan, and our appeasement of Iran, President Obama is letting it be known that the world's lone superpower doesn't do ground wars anymore.""When I ran for president eight years ago as a candidate who had opposed the decision to go to war in Iraq, I said that America didn't just have to end that war,"" Obama said at his recent American University speech defending the Iran nuclear deal. ""We had to end the mindset that got us there in the first place.""According to Obama, ""it was a mindset characterized by a preference for military action over diplomacy."" And one of his favorite talking points is that the U.S. must avoid ""getting dragged into another ground war.""That is clearly music to the ears of his Democrat Party base. But to America's enemies around the world, it's the sound of U.S. weakness — and the opportunity for aggression.We may have about 29,000 U.S. troops stationed in South Korea right now, but about a decade ago we had more than 40,000; in Ronald Reagan's second term we had 45,000. But what difference do numbers make if we are unwilling to use them if and when the enemy launches a war?The exchanges between oppressive North Korea and free South Korea are the most ominous hostilities between the two powers in many years. It could dissipate, as past exchanges have.Then again, supreme leader Kim Jong Un and his military advisors may well have determined that the second half of the second term of a president ""elected to end wars"" is the perfect time to strike.After all, if Obama is so adamant that ""another prolonged ground war in the Middle East"" is ""not in our national security interest,"" what would ever convince him that a major ground war in the Korean Peninsula would be?Another sign of U.S. weakness that can't have gone unnoticed by Kim and his henchmen is found elsewhere in Asia. Politico reported last month of friction between the White House and the Pentagon regarding artificial islands in the South China Sea upon which China is deploying arms:""Military officials and congressional hawks want the U.S. to make a major demonstration by sending warships within 12 miles of the artificial islands and make clear to China that the U.S. rejects its territorial claims.""By not doing so, they charge, the administration ""is tacitly accepting China's destabilizing moves, which are seen by U.S. allies in the region such as Japan, the Philippines and Vietnam as highly threatening.""The giant platforms could be mobile, and U.S. Pacific Command chief Adm. Harry Harris last month warned they could be used as bases for Chinese bombers, fighters, ships and surveillance.Whether it's North Korea invading the south, or China invading free Taiwan, our downsized military, which can no longer fight two major wars simultaneously, is led by a commander-in-chief who repeatedly makes it clear that he won't commit troops to a mission to repel aggression.

32,ADM,"Scandal: The latest revelations that Hillary Clinton's server was wiped clean and that emails stored on it contained top secret information show this breach was no accident. It's time for the appointment of a special prosecutor.Clinton steadfastly refused for months to hand over the ""home brew"" email server she used as secretary of state. It took an order from a judge last week to get her to do so, even though it was used for government work.But what did she hand over? A server that's been professionally wiped clean, and a thumb drive that had been kept illegally in the office of her lawyer.The standard denials have been made. Clinton, her spokespeople say, committed no crimes.And Clinton herself categorically denied having any classified information on her server.Both denials look like evasions and possibly — if not probably — obstruction of justice.Clinton has argued that handling emails on a private server isn't a violation of the law. True enough, when Hillary became secretary of state in 2009, departmental rules did permit officials to use home computers.But emails had to be secured. Moreover, just nine months after taking office, new rules came into effect requiring that all emails be placed on department servers.""Her emails were not secured or captured on department servers,"" National Journal's Ron Fournier notes.Of greatest concern is that Clinton replaced an old server in 2013 with a new one, moving all the data from one to the other. Somewhere along the line, tens of thousands of emails were deleted.Yes, Clinton did eventually hand over hard copies of some 30,000 emails. But she sent or received some 60,000 as secretary of state. So what did she delete and when did she delete it? And why?In violation of the law, she almost certainly exposed U.S. secrets on her server. The inspector general for the federal government's 17 spy agencies this week noted two of 40 random emails of the 30,000 that Clinton has handed over contained what it called ""Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information.""The AP reports those emails included discussion of an article on a U.S. drone operation and a ""separate conversation"" whose source may be ""highly classified.""Do a little math. If the 2-in-40 ratio for top secret to nontop-secret emails holds up, investigators could find as many as 1,500 secrets made available to prying eyes on Hillary's private email server.That's a massive potential breach of national security.If Clinton had been a Republican, criminal charges would have already been drawn up — just ask Scooter Libby and Adm. John Poindexter, both of whom were convicted on lesser obstruction charges.What is Hillary hiding? Secrets of how she used public office for private gain to enrich the Clinton Foundation? Evidence of misconduct over Benghazi? Something we don't even know about?""It's definitely a criminal probe,"" a government source told the New York Post. Maybe so.After months of denial, lies, delay and obstruction, it's time for Clinton to be deposed and investigated.We need a special prosecutor with the tools to do it.

""Key industries that will drive the adoption of commercial drones include film, media, agriculture and oil and gas.""Meanwhile, the strong growth in the drone-enabled services market will be driven by applications such as filming and entertainment, mapping, aerial assessments, prospecting and disaster relief.""Still, the nascent industry faces significant challenges, Wheelock said. They include regulatory policy, public perception, safety and privacy.The Federal Aviation Administration is working on regulations for commercial drone operations in U.S. airspace. Companies hope to use drones for such tasks as inspecting crops and pipelines, news gathering and even package delivery if Amazon.com (AMZN) has its way.Companies that have received special exemptions from the FAA to fly their drones include food-processing and commodities giant Archer Daniels Midland (ADM), infrastructure service firm Aecom Technology (ACM), commercial drone maker AeroVironment (AVAV), mining company Freeport-McMoRan (FCX), engineering services firm Oceaneering International (OII) and GPS company Trimble Navigation (TRMB).

35,ADM,"Like our new chief of naval operations, Adm. John Richardson — who ascribes ""ambiguous motivations"" to Vladimir Putin's Russia rather than its obvious hostile intentions — U.S. Air Force Gen. Philip M. Breedlove, NATO's head of the U.S. European Command, also indicated that we don't have our heads straight about Moscow's behavior, despite its many years of post-Cold War aggressiveness.""We are not where we need to be now"" regarding Russia, but the intelligence community is ""beginning to look at reprioritizing assets"" and ""We're gently turning the nose of this ship to get back to what we need to be looking at,"" Breedlove said, as quoted in Defense News.Gentle turnarounds may be too little, too late. With a long-acknowledged need for more human intelligence, Breedlove bemoaned the ""lack of ability to see into Russia, especially at the operational and tactical level."" Contrary to our long-standing previous approach, he said, ""Now we see that, possibly, we didn't have the partner we thought we had, and we're having to readjust.""So much for Hillary Clinton's reset button.As Richard Fernandez described Breedlove's comments in PJ Media, ""the Pentagon only put Russia back on the list of potential enemies in the last few days."" Fernandez also quoted the Center For Strategic And Budgetary Assessments' Andrew Krepinevich, appearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee.""Russia's recent behavior suggests that its 2008 military campaign against Georgia was not an aberration but rather an initial effort to overturn the prevailing regional order,"" Krepinevich warned. ""By seizing the Crimea, waging unconventional warfare in eastern Ukraine and engaging in military deployments that threaten its East European neighbors, Moscow has made it clear that it does not accept the post-Cold War political order in Europe.""Why can someone in a think tank see what our spies and military brass are blind to? Not to mention the commander-in-chief, who taunted his Republican opponent in 2012 for considering Russia our main global enemy.""You know, the Cold War's been over for 20 years,"" President Obama told Mitt Romney. Even Obama himself, despite his ego, may have admitted to himself he was wrong on this by now.
"
36,ADM,"Global Power: ""Ambiguous motivations"" are what the new U.S. chief of naval operations says are behind the most Russian naval activity in 20 years, including along our coast. Not exactly Pattonesque.Of the Russians, Gen. George S. Patton once said, ""I have no particular desire to understand them, except to ascertain how much lead or iron it takes to kill them."" Patton's vice may have been an over-eagerness to wage war, but at least he was never bewildered by an enemy acting like an enemy.These days we find Adm. John Richardson, President Obama's new chief of naval operations, wondering in a Financial Times interview about the ""ambiguous motivations"" behind China's and Russia's increasingly aggressive military actions, fretting that they'll ""perturb"" the international system of free navigation and trade.Russian ruler Vladimir Putin is throwing substantially more weight around the world with his navy, including a recent boast of 50% more submarine patrols than two years ago. According to Richardson, a former sub commander himself, it's a long-term development to ""make sure that they're being part of this whole conversation that's emerging.""And ""the conversation we're having right now"" within the U.S. Navy is whether to have a greater presence in Europe to oppose Moscow.One of the suspicious activities that Putin's subs are up to is scrutinizing trans-Atlantic communications cables on the ocean's seabed, which Richardson calls a threat ""linked to prosperity, linked to security."" Richardson also defended the current absence, for fleet maintenance, of a U.S. aircraft carrier in the Persian Gulf, promising ""increased presence going forward.""Senate Republicans have blasted Obama's choices for military leadership, in particular the now-departed Joint Chiefs chairman, Gen. Martin Dempsey, charged with ""significant deficiencies in command"" last year. ""From Syria to Benghazi, there has been either a profound inability or clear unwillingness to identify and prevent problems before they arise,"" six GOP Senate intelligence committee members wrote.Forget the ""conversations"" and psychoanalysis of our adversaries; like Patton's, our military has to be ready to defeat them in a war — and assume no ambiguity whatsoever over the hostile nature of the enemy.How disturbing it is now to reflect on the president's wisecracks in the third 2012 presidential debate. ""When you were asked what's the biggest geopolitical threat facing America,"" he told Mitt Romney, ""you said Russia, not al-Qaida. ... In the 1980s, they're now calling to ask for their foreign policy back because, you know, the Cold War's been over for 20 years.""To Romney's concern that ""our navy is smaller now than at any time since 1917; the navy said they needed 313 ships to carry out their mission; we're now at under 285,"" Obama condescendingly taunted: ""We also have fewer horses and bayonets, because the nature of our military's changed. We have these things called aircraft carriers, where planes land on them. We have these ships that go underwater, nuclear submarines.""Romney also warned, ""We've changed for the first time since FDR . .. the strategy of saying we could fight in two conflicts at once. Now we're changing to one.""The Heritage Foundation's just-released 2016 Index of U.S. Military Strength found our navy to be in a state of weak capability and only marginal readiness, with ""its ability to surge to meet combat requirements"" ranging from ""weak"" to ""very weak.""But is that worse than leaders — from commander-in-chief to his brass — who are blind to who our enemies are, even when our enemies are making it clear to us?

Obama countered that ""we also have fewer horses and bayonets, because the nature of our military's changed.""The condescension continued: ""We have these things called aircraft carriers, where planes land on them ... so the question is not a game of 'Battleship,' where we're counting ships.""The president would be advised not to try such verbal stratagems on retired Adm. James Stavridis, who as Supreme Allied Commander from 2009 to 2013 not only knows that 21st century warfare is no game of ""Battleship""; he saw Obama doing what Romney accused him of, up close.Appearing Sunday on John Catsimatidis' radio show on AM 970 in New York City, Stavridis pointed out that the U.S. has cut defense by about 30% in the last decade, ""and we're still at war . . . actively involved on multiple continents in real combat operations. We should not be drastically reducing our troop levels.""And those ""things called aircraft carriers, where planes land on them""? Complaining about Obama withdrawing the sole aircraft carrier on Mideast patrol, Stavridis, the first naval officer to command NATO, pointed out that ""we have 11 active nuclear aircraft carriers today in the United States Navy,"" making it ""hard for me to understand why we cannot manage a fleet of that size to maintain an aircraft carrier at all times in regions as dangerous as the Arabian Gulf.""The current dean of Tufts University's Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy also warned that the alliance he once commanded isn't mobilized against the Islamic State. ""It's important that NATO take on ISIS,"" Stavridis stressed.Having also commanded USEUCOM, America's forces in Europe, Stavridis bemoaned too little opposition to Moscow's aggression in Crimea, warning that Russian forces, while dwarfed by NATO, ""can still be extremely disruptive; we have to stand firmly against them to deter them.""Will Obama scoff at the man who commanded NATO for most of his presidency, the way he did at Romney when his GOP rival warned of Russia's new aggressiveness under Vladimir Putin? Obama jeered during that third debate that the 1980s were ""calling to ask for their foreign policy back because, you know, the Cold War's been over for 20 years.""Of course, Stavridis is far from the only Obama critic whose expertise extends far beyond playing ""Battleship"" as a kid. Less than a month ago, Foreign Policy magazine reported that Air Force Gen. Paul Selva, Obama's choice as vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, called Russia an ""existential threat to this country should they choose to be,"" a far bigger threat to the homeland than Islamist terrorists.Marine Corps Gen. Joseph Dunford, Obama's pick for Joint Chiefs chairman, agreed, arguing during his Senate confirmation hearings that Moscow ""could pose an existential threat to the United States.""Moreover, Obama's first defense secretary, Robert Gates, wrote in his memoir of Obama's very own military strategy in Afghanistan that the commander-in-chief was ""skeptical if not outright convinced it would fail."" Leon Panetta, whom Obama appointed to replace Gates, has scorched Obama on Iraq, Syria and negotiating with Iran.Dovish presidential candidates of the future may be victim to a debate line that turns one of Obama's upside down: ""The Obama years are calling to ask for their foreign policy back"" — that is, if America hasn't succumbed to the existential threats that our military brass today are warning us about.

40,ADM,"Was Harry Truman a war criminal? Seventy years after ordering the atomic incineration of two densely populated Japanese cities — Hiroshima on Aug. 6, 1945, and Nagasaki three days later — America's 33rd president remains the only world leader to have unleashed the horror of nuclear hellfire on civilians.
"
41,ADM,"""I regarded the bomb as a military weapon and never had any doubt that it should be used,"" Give 'Em Hell Harry said in 1945.Though estimates vary, the number of people killed in both attacks totaled over 200,000. The count includes those who perished from radiation poisoning and several thousand Korean ""guest"" workers. Twelve U.S. Navy fliers languishing in a Hiroshima jail also died.Those who survived the atomic blasts became known as the hibakusha, hideously mutilated monstrosities. In ""Nagasaki: Life After Nuclear War,"" Susan Southard describes these wretched souls: ""Hundreds of field workers and others staggered by, moaning and crying. Some were missing body parts, and others were so badly burned that even though they were naked, Yoshida couldn't tell if they were men or women.""American occupying forces made certain to censor or confiscate any and all photographs, films and medical data of the Dantesque inferno, lest critics draw a parallel between the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings and Nazi Germany's death camps.This was not what Italian physicist Enrico Fermi envisioned when he produced the world's first controlled, self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction on a University of Chicago squash court on Dec. 2, 1942.Yet Truman was unrepentant, insisting that his swift act of retribution against Japanese ""military bases"" ended the war and saved countless American and Japanese lives: ""The Japanese began the war from the air at Pearl Harbor. They have been repaid many fold.""Indeed, the fanatical military of the Land of the Rising Sun had cut a wide swath of savagery across Manchuria, Nanking, Korea and much of Asia. And Missouri's favorite son came upon the world stage in media res.

But now the fate of the free world hinged on the decision-making acumen of a failed haberdasher.Besides agonizing over the prospect of Stalin's Soviet Union joining the fray against Japan — and upending the post-war international order — what weighed most heavily on Truman's mind was the prospect of the Okinawa-like carnage that might ensue if the U.S. went ahead with Operation Downfall and invaded Japan via Kyushu and Honshu.But once the Japanese leaders rejected the Allies (July 1945) Potsdam declaration calling for Japan's unconditional surrender, the president chose to let slip the dogs of nuclear warfare .Ironically, more than a few found Truman's decision to attack Hiroshima and Nagasaki morally indefensible and militarily unnecessary: Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower, Adm. William Leahy, Gen. Douglas MacArthur, Adm. Chester Nimitz, Gen. Henry ""Hap"" Arnold and Adm. William ""Bull"" Halsey.After Potsdam, believing that Japan was ""already defeated"" and seeking to surrender ""with a minimum loss of 'face,'"" Eisenhower actively urged Truman and Stimson to ""avoid shocking world opinion"" by using such a wicked weapon.Leahy found the entire scenario obscene: ""My own feeling was that in being the first to use it, we had adopted an ethical standard common to the barbarians of the Dark Ages.""Former President Hoover wrote in 1945 that ""the use of the atomic bomb, with its with its indiscriminate killing of women and children, revolts my soul.""War theory's concept of ius in bello holds that when nations wage war on non-combatants, use disproportionate or unreasonable force or violate norms of civilized conduct, they commit acts that are tantamount to murder.To date, no American president — Democrat or Republican — has ever broadly or formally apologized for Harry Truman's cold-blooded atomic annihilation of Japanese civilians at Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Iaconis, adjunct professor of political science at Briarcliffe College on Long Island, N.Y., is writing a novel about Truman.

50,ADM,"Edsel Ford was one of the masterminds of the Allied victory in World War II. Today, the son of the founder of Ford Motor (F)is mainly remembered for the Edsel, a failed 1958-60 car model.
"
51,ADM,"Yet, against the wishes of his father, it was Edsel who transformed the firm's factories into powerhouses that turned out:

"
57,ADM,"The Liberator pounded Nazi positions at Normandy to make way for the D-Day invasion of June 6, 1944, and played a crucial role in the victory over Japan.

58,ADM,"""Edsel could have walked away from the family business as a young man and led a life of luxury,"" A.J. Baime, author of ""The Arsenal of Democracy: FDR, Detroit and an Epic Quest to Arm an America at War,"" told IBD. ""Instead, despite the fact that he was dying and having to endure his father's domineering behavior, Edsel earned the respect of all who worked with him to overcome seemingly insurmountable obstacles to the Allied victory.""
"
59,ADM,"On The Way Up
"
60,ADM,"Edsel (1893-1943) was born poor, but after Henry founded the car company in 1903, the family became rich. The patriarch's greatest innovation was the assembly line for the plant on the River Rouge in the Detroit suburb of Dearborn.
"
61,ADM,"Edsel joined Dad full time after high school, then in 1916 married Eleanor Clay from a prominent family. They had a daughter and three sons, one of whom, Henry II, would become the company's president.
"
62,ADM,"In 1919, Henry officially made Edsel, 25, president of the company, claiming that he wanted to ""pursue other ventures.""
"
63,ADM,"Both shared a fascination with aviation and saw huge potential.
"
64,ADM,"In 1925, the firm bought Stout Metal Airplane Co., the first builder of all-metal commercial aircraft.
"
65,ADM,"Soon Ford Motor was the largest maker of commercial planes, with a private airport that was one of the busiest. Edsel became civil aviation's greatest booster, offering prizes for cross-country tours to prove its safety. He also sponsored Adm. Richard Byrd's flights over the North and South poles.
"
66,ADM,"By 1927, Henry and Edsel Ford together were worth $1.2 billion (the equivalent to $16.3 billion today), making them the world's richest men.
"
67,ADM,"Edsel had become a friend of future President Franklin Roosevelt, and on a 1928 visit to Warm Springs, Ga., where FDR went to soothe his polio-riddled body, he donated $25,000 to found the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis, later known as the March of Dimes.
"
68,ADM,"But the Great Depression caused the Ford plane business to nose-dive and the car division to crash.
"
69,ADM,"By 1936, Ford's auto market share had dropped from first to third, which made for the strained relationship between father and son.
"
70,ADM,"""Henry loved his only child, but he began to feel he'd had little success in molding a successor in his own crafty, hard-boiled image,"" wrote Richard Bak in ""Henry and Edsel: The Creation of the Ford Empire."" ""He had trouble accepting Edsel's urbane, sophisticated tastes, which ran counter to his in almost every way. Edsel liked reading the New Yorker and Kipling; Henry slapped his bony knee over 'Little Orphan Annie' cartoons and cornball jokes. Edsel smoked Camels and drank highballs; Henry was a teetotaler who did not allow tobacco of any kind on company property. Edsel was a philanthropist; Henry didn't believe in charity.""
"
71,ADM,"Their differences extended to the automobile. Edsel had a gift for design; Henry wanted to make only black and basic Model T's.
"
72,ADM,"Doing The Continental
"
73,ADM,"""Edsel accomplished a great deal, in addition to overseeing massive expansion of their factories and the administration of global operations,"" said George Cook, executive professor at the University of Rochester business school and a former Ford executive. ""He insisted that the Model A of 1928 have four-wheel mechanical brakes and a sliding-gear transmission, as well as an iconic design. He developed the famous Mercury 8 in 1939, which had a V-8 engine and hydraulic brakes, both of which his father opposed. The Lincoln Continental was based on Edsel's personal car.""

"
79,ADM,"Edsel and Ford manager Charlie Sorensen met with Knudsen in June 1941 and agreed to make 9,000 Rolls-Royce Merlin aircraft engines. But when they returned to Detroit, Henry canceled the order because he thought wars were unnecessary and didn't want America involved in Europe.
"
80,ADM,"Soon Edsel experienced intense stomach pain. Those around him assumed the cause was an ulcer caused by working with his father, but doctors couldn't diagnose it.
"
81,ADM,"After the Pearl Harbor attack on Dec. 7, 1941, Edsel convinced his father that the time had come to choose sides in the global clash between the forces of good and evil.
"
82,ADM,"Wide Turn
"
83,ADM,"Henry reluctantly gave in, and Ford car production soon ended to shift into a war footing.
"
84,ADM,"""From that moment on, Edsel hurled the family empire into aviation manufacturing, despite Sorensen's observation that they were moving 'fast and dangerously,'"" said Baime. ""Edsel had declared a goal of turning out one B-24 Liberator per hour at a time when the only manufacturer was making less than a dozen a month. It was over 66 feet long with a wingspan of 110 feet, and four engines with combined power equal to 56 Ford V8s. It could fly 300 mph for 3,000 miles with a payload equivalent to 8,000 pounds of TNT.""
"
85,ADM,"Ford Motor was building the world's largest factory at Willow Run near Detroit at a cost of $47 million (worth $755 million today). Special equipment had to be designed to adapt plane making to Ford's assembly line production.

"
87,ADM,"In January 1943, Edsel had stomach surgery, and inoperable tumors were discovered. Wife Eleanor begged him to stop working, but he was committed to spending his final days trying to reach his goal of one bomber per hour, which would be achieved later that year.

94,ADM,"Defense Obligations: Despite Russian submarine activity that's up a reported 50% and a rising cruise-missile threat, President Obama can't find the time to meet with NATO's new secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg.Following a pattern of talking only to our enemies and not to Congress or allies such as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Obama apparently has decided to ignore Stoltenberg during a three-day visit to the U.S. According to Bloomberg, Stoltenberg's office requested a meeting in advance of the visit, but heard nothing back from the White House.The president presumably is too busy explaining to the Iranian people why we must sign a nuclear Munich deal with an enemy whose leaders shout, ""Death to America!""Stoltenberg, twice the prime minister of Norway, met with Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper on Monday, to discuss the upcoming NATO summit, the rising threat of the Islamic State worldwide and Russia's aggression toward and annexation of Ukraine.The new NATO chief is well aware of increasing Russian bomber patrols that include mock attack runs on NATO members Britain and Sweden along with threats to aim nuclear missiles at Danish warships. The patrols have also buzzed U.S. warships, overflown Guam and approached within cruise missile range of Los Angeles.""It is hard for me to believe that the president of the United States has not found time to meet with the new secretary general of NATO given the magnitude of what this implies, and the responsibilities of his office,"" says Kurt Volker, who served as U.S. permanent representative to NATO under both Obama and President George W. Bush.Russian strategic bombers entered some 16 U.S. northwestern air defense zones in one 10-day period last August and have practiced attack drills off Alaska. These practice runs come as Russia develops new cruise missiles to arm these bombers and warships.Adm. William Gortney, commander of U.S. Northern Command, which includes our air and missile defense, NORAD, testified recently before a House armed services subcommittee on the Russian cruise missile threat.This includes the conventionally armed KH-101, which Russia has developed to attack critical infrastructure such as the U.S. electrical grid, and a sea-based variant of the KH-101 reportedly being deployed on Russian Severodvinsk-class nuclear attack subs.Meantime, we have eliminated our only sub-launched nuclear cruise missile and have curtailed production of the potent and feared Tomahawk.Admiral Viktor Chirkov, commander of Russia's Navy, took the occasion of Russia's Submariner Day to recently note that Russian submarine activity has increased 50% since January 2014. Besides trolling off our eastern seaboard, Russia says its nuclear subs will soon resume patrols in the Southern Hemisphere after a nearly two-decade absence.In addition to its annexation of Crimea, Russia has moved troops and weapons into eastern Ukraine as it places nuclear-capable missiles in striking distance of our NATO allies.As we refuse to send lethal defensive weaponry to aid Ukraine, Russia's advanced SU-30 fighter jets have been practicing attack runs on NATO warships in the Black Sea, including the U.S. missile cruiser Vicksburg.There's certainly enough going on that threatens both NATO and American interests for President Obama to have set aside a few moments with NATO Secretary General Stoltenberg. But then, maybe our apparent lack of concern and sense of urgency is part of that ""flexibility"" Obama promised the Russians regarding missile defense upon his reelection.Russian President Vladimir Putin clearly has his nation's national security and strategic interests at heart. We wish our commander-in-chief felt the same way about ours.

""I've taken a look at the folks that we have doing it, and we have the capacity and they have the time and they've got the parts.""A software patch for the Autonomic Logistics Information System, which helps manage diagnostics, maintenance and supply-chain issues, also will be ""satisfactory"" and will have the plane working at its ""highest capacity.""Last year, the Government Accountability Office found that the F-35 program continues to ""encounter slower than expected progress in developing the Autonomic Logistics Information System.""The stealth jet is behind schedule and over budget, but Dunford stressed the need for the plane because other jets in service are near the end of their life-cycles.Software glitches have been a persistent problem, and earlier reports said software issues will prevent the F-35 from being able to fire its 25mm cannon until 2019.Also during the hearing, Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Jonathan Greenert said submarine shipbuilding is a top priority as Congress asks the Navy to scale back its budget.General Dynamics (GD) and Huntington Ingalls Industries (HII), which was spun off from Northrop Grumman (NOC) in 2011, are the two major submarine defense builders.GD shares dipped 0.5%, and Huntington was up 1%.Follow Gillian Rich on Twitter: @IBD_GRich.

110,ADM,"Commodore George Dewey sailed into history at the Battle of Manila Bay in 1898. ""Dewey was a dependable and responsible naval officer who consistently performed his duties with great tenacity,"" David Way, curator for the Pacific Battleship Center in San Pedro, Calif., told IBD.
"
111,ADM,"""Having served with distinction during the Civil War, he was cool under fire and understood the importance of emphasizing preparation and training. That and his bold tactics ensured victory at the Battle of Manila Bay, which increased America's sphere of influence in the Pacific.""

"
117,ADM,"Of his 100 classmates, only 13 others were commissioned as midshipmen four years later.
"
118,ADM,"In recognition of Dewey's skills, the Navy assigned him to one of its best ships, the steam frigate Wabash, flagship of the Mediterranean Squadron.
"
119,ADM,"At the start of the Civil War in 1861, Dewey was executive lieutenant on the steam frigate Mississippi, blockading the coast of the Confederacy along the Gulf of Mexico.
"
120,ADM,"The next year, Dewey's ship was attached to Capt. David Farragut's fleet, sent to assault New Orleans. Two imposing forts commanded the entry to the Mississippi River there. Farragut was ordered to take them before attacking the city.
"
121,ADM,"The captain ignored orders and on the night of April 24 led his ships past the forts, whose cannons opened up too late to do much damage.
"
122,ADM,"""During the battle, Dewey noticed an irregular-shaped object bearing down on the Mississippi,"" wrote John Wukovits in a chapter of ""The Great Admirals,"" edited by Jack Sweetman. ""It was the Confederate ram Manassas. With no time to consult the captain, Dewey immediately ordered the helm hard astarboard. The ram struck her a glancing blow, but major damage was avoided by Dewey's adroit handling of the ship.""
"
123,ADM,"Dewey had found a new role model in the bold planning and execution of his captain and throughout his career would ask himself, ""What would Farragut do?""
"
124,ADM,"Further up the river, in a battle off Port Hudson, La., Dewey's ship ran aground, and he directed its abandonment under heavy fire.
"
125,ADM,"Three of the lifeboats had been destroyed. Each of the other three had to make multiple trips to shore. When rowers hesitated, Dewey jumped into one of the boats and ran the operation at gunpoint until everyone was rescued.
"
126,ADM,"In 1864, he became executive officer of the steam frigate Colorado, which had an undisciplined crew of 700, 100 of whom had to be put in chains. When many didn't bother to show up for duty the first morning, Dewey stormed through the lower decks and tipped over the hammocks of late risers.
"
127,ADM,"A few days later, a huge sailor named Webster threatened to use a bottle to kill the first man who came down the ladder. Dewey simply grabbed a revolver and warned that he would shoot the big brute if he raised the bottle.
"
128,ADM,"Webster backed down.
"
129,ADM,"In December of that last full year of the Civil War, an Army-Navy assault on the last open port in the Confederacy, Fort Fisher, N.C., failed.
"
130,ADM,"The Union tried again in January 1865, and Dewey played a key role in silencing the enemy artillery, so the fort was captured. He was promoted to lieutenant commander.
"
131,ADM,"In 1867, two years after war's end, he married Susan Goodwin, daughter of New Hampshire's governor. They had a son, George, in 1872, but Susan would die five days later.

"
138,ADM,"On April 26, 1898, the U.S. squadron was ordered to attack the Spanish fleet at Manila Bay.
"
139,ADM,"It was expected to be the first naval battle with modern ships and ordnance, but intelligence on the Spanish was limited.
"
140,ADM,"Dewey's fleet arrived at the mouth of the bay four days later, at night. An attack had to be successful, or his men would be in trouble 7,000 miles from the nearest American dockyard; damaged ships would be as good as sunk.
"
141,ADM,"Spanish forts on the islands of Corregidor, Caballo and El Fraile, with narrow passages between them, protected the bay.

158,ADM,"Adm. Hyman Rickover was not a fan of neat formulas.Leadership to him meant so much more than coloring by the numbers.He openly dissed hidebound Navy brass and infuriated defense contractors, resulting in repeated efforts to end his career.Those moves to ax him backfired, as allies in Congress and the public saw him as a hero, standing up to corruption and incompetence.Their backing helped him serve 63 years of active duty, a record.""He didn't think case studies in schools, books or seminars, designing a grand strategic theory, hiring consultants and relying on formal organizational charts had any meaning,"" Tim Foster, a former Rickover senior staff member, told IBD.The Rickover Direction""These, he believed, tended to limit individual creativity, initiative and personal responsibility, and the only thing that counted was the experience that would help form good judgment, which needed to be honed with constant training,"" said Foster, author of ""Technology and Leadership: Hyman G. Rickover"" in the volume ""The Art of Command,"" edited by Harry Laver and Jeffrey Matthews. ""Rickover was arguably the most significant technical leader in U.S. military history.""Rickover drove the creation of the nuclear Navy, whose submarines served as a gun to the head of any Soviet leader who might be tempted to incinerate America.Rickover (1900-86) was born Chaim Godalia Rickover to a Jewish family in Makow Mazowiecki, Poland, then ruled by Russia.The Rickovers fled persecution in 1906, arriving in New York City and soon moving to the Chicago suburb of Lawndale, where the patriarch worked as a tailor.As a Western Union messenger during high school, Hyman got to know his congressman, who recommended him to the Naval Academy in Annapolis, Md.But Rickover was not ready for the entrance exam, so he paid for a preparatory class. He quickly realized that it was over his head, dropped out and did his own intensive study, passing the algebra portion by one-tenth of a point.Graduating in 1922, he was commissioned as an ensign and assigned to a destroyer, learning every facet of its operation. Then he served on five other ships, his only command being on a minesweeper in 1937.He was allowed ashore to earn a master's degree in electrical engineering from Columbia University in 1929. Two years later, he married fellow student Ruth Masters, and they would have one child. After Ruth's death in 1972, he married Eleonore Bednowicz.A big break came in 1939, when he was promoted to lieutenant commander and made assistant chief of the electrical section of the Bureau of Ships in Washington, D.C. He immediately demonstrated his disregard for fiefdoms, rules and politics, implementing crucial responsibilities for the officer in charge of each system and component. Superiors who admired him helped him bypass the bureaucracy and get things done.Sparking DefenseRickover inspected the wreckage at Pearl Harbor in December 1941 and oversaw repairs to the electrical plant. This experience convinced him that the Navy needed tougher equipment. He was promoted to commander and captain the same year, as he became the scourge of the Pentagon's cozy relationship with contractors. In 1945, he was awarded the Legion of Merit for the dramatic improvement of his section.""In his first two decades with the Navy, he hadn't performed well in the two roles the Navy valued most, command at sea and performance under fire, which is why he wasn't given any direct military responsibility during the war,"" said Dave Oliver, a former nuclear submarine commander under Rickover and author of ""Against the Tide: Rickover's Leadership Principles and the Rise of the Nuclear Navy."" ""But as it turned out, he was a late bloomer as a great leader.""In 1946, a year after World War II ended, Rickover was assigned to the Manhattan Project to determine atomic applications for the Navy. He persuaded his superiors that a specially designed reactor could power ships.Wearing two hats as head of the Navy's new nuclear program and director of the Atomic Energy Commission's naval reactor division, he had the clout to cut through red tape and produce the USS Nautilus, the world's first nuclear submarine, in just eight years.High GearOver 200 subs and a couple of dozen carriers and destroyers, all powered by nuclear engines, would be constructed — some with strategic ballistic missiles and, later, cruise missiles for combat.""His attention to detail, commitment to excellence, almost round-the-clock availability, insistence on thorough vetting of issues, quick and decisive actions with documented rationale and the directness with which he leveled criticism, with no punishment for those who argued with him, help explain why so many found working with him so fulfilling, despite his reputation for being a tough boss,"" said Foster.Rickover believed that personal responsibility, absolute integrity and constant training were necessary to make sure that this dangerous fleet was kept 100% safe.He refused to delegate interviews with applicants to the program, conducting thousands of often tense discussions in which he tested their ability to handle pressure.As the Soviets ramped up their nuclear sub program, their scientists did a good job creating ships that were fast and quiet, building twice as many as all other nations combined. But America maintained the lead on stealth — turning subs invisible to sonar and thermal imaging — which forced the Soviets to spend heavily in an ultimately unsuccessful effort to locate them.The U.S. also never had a serious accident; the Soviets had 14 known major nuclear naval disasters.Rickover's domestic enemies made sure that he was passed over for promotion in 1951 and 1952. That should have ended his career, according to Navy rules. But his fans in the Senate held up confirmation of 39 admirals to keep him on. In 1958 he was raised to vice admiral and received the first of two Congressional Gold Medals.""He was protected by every president, since they knew this was our only answer to Russia and a matter of our survival, more than the public realized,"" said Oliver. ""His program of continuous technical improvement produced submarines that were so advanced, they could penetrate all underwater defenses and were essentially invulnerable, controlling what moved on the surface of oceans and deep beneath.""In the 1960s, Rickover testified to Congress about how defense contractors were bilking taxpayers. He asserted that those who were crooked about financial matters would also cut corners in safety and technology. Congress responded with the Cost Accounting Standards Board in 1970.In 1973, President Nixon finally awarded Rickover his fourth star.The Navy man continued to make waves, targeting the nation's three largest shipbuilders, which had filed $3 billion in cost overruns. He argued that the system rewarded contract winners that low-balled estimates and expected the government to bail them out.The EndThe admiral resigned in January 1982 and died four years later at age 86. His burial site at Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia overlooks President Kennedy's Eternal Flame. The admiral had given JFK a fisherman's prayer that landed on a plaque in the Oval Office and read: ""O God, thy sea is so great and my boat is so small.""""The pressure on the Soviet leaders, who knew their nuclear-assured second-strike capability was placed at risk by the American submarines, finally affected their psyche,"" said Oliver. ""In December 1989, off Malta, when President Bush met with President Gorbachev, Bush was handed the Soviet leader's morning intelligence report by Marshal Akhromeyev, who said, 'We have read every one of your submarine messages for 10 years and have been unable to find or kill even one of them. We quit.'""

160,ADM,"Defense: Members of Congress warn that the State Department is working on arms accords to demilitarize space and ban anti-satellite weapons, leaving Russia and China with a huge lead in military space capabilities.On Jan. 17, 2012, then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton issued a statement announcing the Obama administration's intention to work with the European Union on an International Code of Conduct for Outer Space Activities. It was supposed to be sort of a ""rules of the road"" for space-faring nations to deal with issues such as the accumulating space junk jeopardizing satellites and manned space activities such as the International Space Station.It soon became apparent that the vague, loosely worded and allegedly nonbinding accord that would be negotiated would become a pretext to restrict the so-called militarization of space. In 2007, a successful Chinese test of an anti-satellite weapon against an aging weather satellite spewed tens of thousands of pieces of debris into low-Earth orbit, posing a hazard. Space treaty advocates felt that space was getting crowded enough without militarizing it.However, a 2012 EU analysis of the draft code provided to the House Armed Services Committee at the time warned that if the U.S. ""were to make a good-faith effort at implementing the requirements of the draft code,"" it would have an impact on U.S. military operations.The 2007 Chinese test was an early probe by that country to see if it could take out U.S. surveillance, communications and GPS satellites. China is deploying its own GPS, and in a conflict with the U.S. it could knock out ours and retain its own GPS capability.This space accord looms as an extraterrestrial version of the Law of the Sea Treaty, a convention that turns control of the world's oceans over to a global administrative body that would replace the U.S. Navy as the guarantor of freedom of navigation. It would tell us what we could do and when on the high seas.U.S. land-based missile defense systems that intercept warheads outside the atmosphere — meaning space — would fall under the ""space military weapons"" category of the draft agreement. Also affected would be our sea-based Aegis missile defense system.In February 2008, Aegis-equipped missile cruiser Lake Erie succeeded in shooting down a non-functioning satellite that weighed 2.5 tons. It hit the satellite before the satellite struck the Earth and spilled the contents of its nearly full deadly hydrazine fuel. Such capabilities would be considered the militarization of space.Last Wednesday, Rep. Doug Lamborn, R-Colo., and Sen. David Vitter, R-La., wrote a letter to Frank A. Rose, deputy assistant secretary of state for space and defense policy, expressing concern that continued pursuit of such an accord would jeopardize national security.""We are deeply concerned by the rising threats of anti-satellite weapons in the hands of states like the People's Republic of China,"" the pair wrote.And well they should be, for it's a capability Beijing is seriously pursuing. China has two ground-based anti-satellite weapon systems, advanced ground-based anti-satellite laser systems, ""and is developing dual-use co-orbital satellites that can monitor or attack U.S. satellites,"" according to Rick Fisher, a China military affairs expert and analyst at the International Assessment and Strategy Center.On July 23, China carried out a test of its Dong Neng-1 satellite interceptor. Adm. Cecil Haney, commander of the U.S. Strategic Command, said the test was a further indication of Chinese efforts to ""militarize space."" This follows a May 2013 test of the Dong-Neng-2.When President Obama told the Russians that after the 2012 election he would have more flexibility to gut U.S. missile-defense capabilities, was he speaking of space defense as well?Like the New Start Treaty, we may be subjected to another arms-control agreement that only leaves the U.S. more exposed to its enemies.

161,ADM,"Military Superiority: China's new Shenyang J-31 stealth fighter could be the equal of our F-22s and F-35s, U.S. pilots say, and is just one of the weapons that may thwart America's ""pivot"" to the Pacific.The J-31, a fifth-generation stealth fighter, will make its official debut at the Zhuhai International Air Show Nov. 11-16 in southern China's Guangdong province. As one U.S. pilot with F-35 experience told USNI News of the J-31 and other new Chinese fighters: ""I think they'll eventually be on par with our fifth-gen jets — as they should be, because industrial espionage is alive and well.""According to the USNI report, it's believed the J-31 was developed using the Pentagon's nearly $400 billion Lockheed Martin F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program.In June 2011, Chinese hackers staged a cyberassault on Lockheed and other defense contractors, one of an ongoing series of attacks seeking to steal U.S. defense technology.The J-31 is about the same size as the F-35 but appears to have sacrificed some payload capability in favor of improved fuel efficiency and speed.Like the F-35, the J-31 is designed to fly off the decks of carriers, making these two planes the world's only carrier-based stealth fighters.The J-31 will join the J-20 stealth fighter in the Chinese air force inventory, another plane based on stolen U.S. technology. In 1999 an American stealth F-117 Nighthawk bomber was shot down in Serbia, and the wreckage reportedly was passed along to the Chinese. A decade later, the J-20 fighter, a spitting image of our F-22 Raptor, took to the air, threatening to alter the balance of power in the western Pacific.The J-20 took its first test flights in 2011 and is now in its fourth round of prototypes. A report issued by the Jamestown Foundation, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank, said that based on available information, the Chinese stealth fighter will be ""a high-performance stealth aircraft, arguably capable of competing . . . with the U.S. F-22A Raptor and superior in most, if not all, cardinal performance parameters against the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter.""As Bill Gertz reports in the Washington Free Beacon: ""The F-35 data theft was confirmed after recent photographs were published on Chinese websites showing a newer version of the J-20. The new version of the radar-evading aircraft had incorporated several design upgrades since the first demonstrator aircraft was unveiled in 2011.""Into the mix enters the new flagship of the Chinese navy, the newly named aircraft carrier Liaoning.Refitted from a ship bought from Ukraine, the ex-Soviet Varyag will have a limited role, mostly for training and testing ahead of the possible launch of China's first domestically built carriers, the floating air bases for the J-31, after 2015.China's burgeoning blue-water Navy includes six nuclear attack submarines to go along with 53 diesel powered subs. Last December, a Chinese attack sub sailed through the Strait of Malacca, then disappeared, resurfacing near Sri Lanka and in the Persian Gulf.Another of China's new weapons is the Dong Feng-21D missile, intended to give China ""the capability to attack large ships, particularly aircraft carriers, in the western Pacific,"" the Pentagon's 2012 China report said.The Chinese have also been testing a hypersonic glide vehicle, the WU-14, designed to evade U.S. missile and other defense systems, such as the Aegis sea-based missile shield guarding our Pacific fleet and carrier battle groups.All of which is why Adm. Samuel J. Locklear III, chief of U.S. Pacific Command, said at the annual Surface Navy Association conference in Virginia in January: ""Our historic dominance that most of us in this room have enjoyed is diminishing, no question.""We'd better put a rush on that ""pivot,"" Mr. President.

162,ADM,"Archer Daniels Midland's (ADM) grain exports and corn processing showed strength during the second quarter, sweetening earnings and boosting shares.The agribusiness giant's adjusted earnings per share surged 67% to 77 cents, surpassing estimates by 4 cents.Revenue slid 4.6% to $21.5 billion, below analyst expectations for $22.8 billion.Looking ahead, the company says it's preparing for what could be a large harvest since crops in Europe and North America are growing nicely.Archer Daniels Midland shares rose 3.7% to 48.67 in the stock market today. The company has an IBD Composite Rating of 82 out of a possible 99.""We capitalized on robust ethanol demand, a recovery of U.S. grain export volumes and continuing strong demand for oilseeds products,"" said CEO Patricia Woertz.Agricultural service operating profit soared 150% to $203 million. Strong U.S. export volumes, partial recovery of a loss reserve and continued improvement in international results led to a merchandising and handling increase of 720% to $115 million. Transportation saw an 800% rise to $27 million.Corn processing operating profit increased 33% to $277 million, excluding a $70 million hedge benefit. Last year's corn hedge produced a benefit of $15 million.Within corn processing, bioproduct results rose 45% to $141 million, thanks to strong demand and good margins in ethanol. Sweeteners and starches improved 23% to $136 million on steady volumes; lower average selling prices were offset by lower net corn costs.Oilseed operating profit edged up 2% to $327 million on lifts in cocoa and the refining, packaging and biodiesel segment.During the quarter, the company inked a deal to buy privately held Swiss flavoring company Wild Flavors, a maker of the sweetener stevia, for $3 billion. The deal is expected to close by the end of the year.The Food-Grain & Related group is ranked No. 13 out of the 197 industries IBD tracks, with Archer Daniels Midland just behind group leader Gruma (GMK). The producer of corn and wheat flour has a 93 Composite Rating. Gruma shares rose 0.7% to 44.59.Grain and oilseed producer Bunge (BG) shares fell 0.4% to 79.98.

164,ADM,"Accountability: The buck is supposed to stop on that desk where the president likes to rest his feet. But when asked by ""60 Minutes,"" Obama passed the blame for the Islamic State's rise onto others.There have been many instances pointed to as Barack Obama's emperor-has-no-clothes moment: ""If you like your plan you can keep your plan"" exposed as a lie; the first 2012 presidential debate; even last week's disgraceful ""latte salute"" to Marines.But the exchange shown to the world on Sunday between the president and his favorite, friendliest interviewer, Steve Kroft of CBS' ""60 Minutes,"" ends whatever doubt there may have been that this most underqualified of presidents is proving to be way out of his depth.Asked about how he could have missed the rise of a terrorist organization with tens of thousands of foot soldiers, Obama flailed like an unprepared law student zeroed in on by Professor Kingsfield, and pathetically tried blaming others.You could see it all in his bitter half-smile as he said, ""Our head of the intelligence community, Jim Clapper, has acknowledged that I think they underestimated what had been taking place in Syria.""As IBD pointed out years ago, Clapper became director of national intelligence to ""Obamacize"" America's spy operations, replacing Adm. Dennis Blair, who, as former House Intelligence Committee Chairman Pete Hoekstra, R-Mich., charges, was ""cut off at every turn by a White House"" treating terrorism as a law-enforcement problem. Clapper may, in fact, be little more than the underling of CIA Director John O. Brennan.You could also see it all in the venom that accompanied Obama's laying the blame on former Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki for not producing ""a government that had built a sense of national unity.""New Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, says Obama, ""so far at least has sent all the right signals."" And so ""it goes back to"" that ""we can't do this for them"" — the familiar Democrat rationale for pulling troops out prematurely from Iraq. These countries that have never known representative government must ""think about what political accommodation means, think about what tolerance means,"" according to Obama.To see the president squirm as he tried to explain the IS disaster to a sympathetic interviewer, reduced to hurling blame this way and that, reveals the essence of the Obama administration. Here is the leader of the free world fidgeting before the cameras because a country infested with terrorists didn't end up following a script his party wrote purely to win elections.Meanwhile — also 100% politics — he has scrapped enhanced interrogation and considering ground forces to fight these terrorists, instead assuring us that having drones kill sources of information about other terrorists is winning what he refuses to call the war on terror.The golf outings, fundraisers and skipped national security briefings are catching up to President Obama, who uses ""we,"" ""they"" and ""you"" when it comes to failure — instead of the ""I"" he so loves when taking credit.

175,ADM,"Lockheed Martin (LMT) has worked out some mechanical issues on the F-35 and racked up more orders, but there are still problems with the stealth jet that could weigh on quarterly earnings.The defense giant reports Tuesday, kicking off a busy week for aerospace companies and Pentagon contractors. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect a nearly 40% jump in Lockheed's fourth-quarter EPS to $2.85 per share. Sales are seen rising 3% to $11.9 billion.During the last quarter, the $400 billion F-35 program got a boost when the Pentagon ordered an eighth batch of fighter jets for $4 billion. The contract also includes additional cost savings. In October, the U.K. announced an agreement in principle to order four more F-35s, bringing the total order up to 14. Israel also has plans to buy more F-35s.United Technologies' (UTX) Pratt & Whitney division said it would supply a seventh batch of F125 engines for the F-35, also with some cost savings.And more orders could come as production costs fall. Operational costs should also fall 15%, Rear Adm. Randy Mahr, the Pentagon's F-35 deputy program manager, told Reuters last year.But developmental problems persist. After an engine fire that temporarily grounded the F-35 fleet last summer, other issues continue to plague the program.Due to delays in software development, the F-35B model won't be able to fire its 25mm cannon by the Marine Corps' July target to declare the jet ready for combat use.Software issues don't stop with the gun. Michael Gilmore, the Pentagon's director of combat testing, told Congress recently there were ""serious deficiencies with hardware and software used to develop data files"" in the plane's computers. The files help identify enemy radar and ""are essential.""But the plane remains in demand around the world. And while the Pentagon and militaries abroad have scaled back budgets, the rise of the Islamic State, unrest in Syria and an aggressive Russia could mean more spending on high-tech weaponry like the F-35.General Dynamics (GD) is slated to announce Q4 results Wednesday. The defense contractor is seen posting a 21% rise in EPS to $2.13 but revenue is seen declining 0.8% to $8.04 billion.Northrup Grumman (NOC) is scheduled to announce results Thursday. The maker of the B-2 Spirit strategic bomber and the Global Hawk drone is expected to report a 6.1% increase in EPS to $2.25 but a 2.7% drop in revenue to $5.99 billion.Last week Northrop CEO Wes Bush said that he was happy with the government's approval of some drone exports but is still concerned that U.S. companies are losing market share over the ban on exporting large drones.Raytheon (RTN) is also slated to announce results Thursday. Analysts expect it to report a 23.3% jump in earnings per share and sales are seen rising 3.4% to $6.07 billion.The Aerospace/Defense group is ranked No. 59 out of the 197 industry groups IBD tracks, up from 104 eight weeks ago.Follow Gillian Rich on Twitter: @IBD_GRich.

178,ADM,"For Donald Kirby Ross, preparedness was a way of life.A Navy warrant officer machinist on the battleship Nevada in 1941, Ross embraced his responsibilities for keeping the ship powered and the crew protected, regardless of the conditions.Those conditions exploded on Dec. 7, 1941, and Ross was ready.For his actions during the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, he received the Medal of Honor.Daughter Penny Ross told Tom Vogt of the Columbian newspaper in Vancouver, Wash., this year that her father practiced his tasks blindfolded.That training became a matter of life and death on the day of the attack as Ross (1910-92) had to keep the forward dynamo room's engines and generators operating. He did it while blinded from smoke that also jarred breathing in heat that reached 140 degrees.If the Nevada lost power in the forward dynamo, the ship would be a sitting duck, helpless against the Japanese aerial assault. Its anti-aircraft guns would be compromised, and communications would be lost too. Ross' efforts prevented the damaged ship from sinking.Every ship saved was vital, as the Japanese meant to obliterate the Pacific Fleet. As it was, 2,400 Americans died in the attack that drew the country into World War II.Honored To The HiltRoss' Medal of Honor citation tells the tale of his courageous selflessness: ""When his station in the forward dynamo room of the USS Nevada became almost untenable due to smoke, steam and heat, Machinist Ross forced his men to leave that station and performed all the duties himself until blinded and unconscious.""""He had trained for that almost on his own,"" Vogt told IBD. ""Ross was preparing for something he didn't know was going to be coming, but he wanted to make sure he had every ability to do the job, even under some pretty disastrous circumstances.""As Kent DeLong wrote in ""War Heroes,"" ""On Dec. 7, no other ship fought back harder than the Nevada.""Ross' daring provided the ship's power for the fight. In April 1942, Adm. Chester Nimitz presented Ross with the Medal of Honor. The citation further reads:""For distinguished conduct in the line of his profession, extraordinary courage and disregard of his own life during the attack on the Fleet in Pearl Harbor, Territory of Hawaii, by Japanese forces. ... Upon being rescued and resuscitated, he returned and secured the forward dynamo room and proceeded to the after dynamo room where he was later again rendered unconscious by exhaustion. Again recovering consciousness, he returned to his station where he remained until directed to abandon it.""""I love my men and I love my ship,"" Ross told a newspaper toward the end of his life. ""They came first. They're more important than I am.""Ross went on to have a top Navy career. With the Nevada, he helped support the Normandy D-Day landings of June 6, 1944. After the war, Ross served as the Nevada's chief engineer in support of two atom bomb tests at Bikini Atoll in the Pacific in 1946. He served on the carrier Kearsarge during the Korean War. After rising to the rank of captain, he retired in 1956.Ross wrote two books on military heroes with his wife, Helen. The couple married in 1942, had four children and ran a dairy farm in Washington state. He also spoke publicly on American history .Ross was born in Beverly, Kan., and enlisted in the Navy in 1929. Demonstrating deep commitment to duty from the start, he graduated with honors from boot camp, completed machinist mate school first in his class and joined the Henderson, a transport ship.For Ross, Dec. 7, 1941, sort of began on Dec. 5. That was the date the Nevada and fellow battleships Arizona and Oklahoma returned to Pearl Harbor after conducting night battle practice in open ocean.When Ross relieved his superior at midnight on Saturday, Dec. 6, he was ordered to ""put the engine room on alert. We need to be ready to answer bells with only a half-hour notice by morning.""Little did they know how good the timing of their drill would be. Normal time to get a battleship up and running from a cold start was 3-1/2 hours.By 5 a.m. on Dec. 7, Ross had two boilers in ready condition and two more about to come on line.The BattleIt was 7:55 a.m. when the Japanese attacked. ""Bombs began hitting American planes on the ramps, and gas tanks were blowing everywhere,"" DeLong wrote. ""Hell was in session.""Ross raced to the engine room and took charge of it. Chief Quartermaster Bob Sedberry, not knowing of the nighttime drill, could not believe it when Ross said they'd be underway in 30 minutes.Disaster came at 8:05 a.m., when a torpedo ripped a hole in the Nevada near the forward dynamo room. The ship took on water.Two minutes later came a tremendous explosion on the Arizona, which was moored to the Nevada's bow. Eleven hundred sailors died on that ill-fated ship.The Nevada was almost ready to get underway when smoke filled Ross' forward dynamo compartment. The rear dynamo room was in better condition, so he transferred power there.Ross kept his 27 men focused on running generators and air compressors to give the Nevada power to fire its guns and ship off.Rear Adm. William Rea Furlong, from his flagship, the minelayer Oglala, ordered that all capable ships speed to sea. Moving out would disperse the concentration amid the attack.The Nevada was the only battleship ready to move by 8:32 a.m., even while Japanese aircraft hit her hard. ""Everything came our way,"" recalled Joseph Taussig, an officer on the ship, ""but we kept firing back.""Fire raged on the Nevada, but the ship's gunners refused to leave their weapons. Every one of the ship's gun captains died, as did half of the initial gunners.BlastedFour more bombs hit the Nevada. Ross, standing under a ventilator, received a blast of fire into his face. His left eye was blinded, his right eye burning from smoke.He was knocked into a daze but recovered and realized that his men were in the cross hairs of death: ""Get out, men! Get the hell out of here!""He said decades later, ""I had to get my people out of there and run those pieces of equipment so the ship wouldn't die.""""The battleship's very survival depended on the efforts of the brave young officer,"" DeLong wrote.Alone in the forward dynamo room, Ross couldn't see anything due to the black smoke and his eye injuries. Fortunately, he told DeLong, ""I could find my way anywhere in that room by feel alone.""Ross was now a one-man crew. He tried to get the power transferred from the forward generators.Just as Ross switched the power, he was heard to say over radio transmission, ""God help me.""When he was rescued from the compartment, he was unconscious and not breathing. Artificial respiration helped him bounce back.Ross now realized that the exhaust in the forward condenser was not secured. It could cause an explosion. So back into the forward dynamo he went, back into the smoke and heat that nearly had killed him. He managed to find the cutoff valve and save the ship.At 9:40 a.m., while still in the harbor, the Nevada beached itself nose first. The landing prevented the ship from sinking.Ultimately, the ship was repaired and continued to fight in the war.The price that day, though, was 57 sailors dead.The morning of Dec. 8, Ross went to sick bay. Eventually his sight cleared up.Ross died at age 81. The sailor's ashes were scattered at sea from his beloved battleship Nevada.

180,ADM,"Cyberwar: The director of the National Security Agency, Adm. Michael Rogers, has warned a congressional panel that China has the capability to knock out the entire U.S. power grid. This is a first-magnitude threat.As severe as U.S. national security problems are with the militarily resurgent Russia and China, an unguarded southern border and an increasingly barbarous, terrorist Middle East, the stealthy speeding shark under the water's surface may well be the Chinese cyberthreat.Rogers warned the House Intelligence Committee this week that China and ""one or two other nations,"" after performing constant ""reconnaissance"" missions on U.S. utility companies, were now in a position to blow out our power grid. It would be an act of war that would leave the U.S. powerless to retaliate and, worse still, powerless to identify the perpetrators.Rogers is hardly the only intelligence official to worry about this threat. The FBI's former top cybercop, retired Assistant Director for Science and Technology Steve Martinez, who addressed a conference in Beverly Hills this week, said that state-sponsored cyberattackers are ""an advanced, persistent threat.""These hackers have been gathering information on entire systems in the U.S. in order to amass capacity to control them, sometimes also infiltrating corporate technology ""if they know it's a duplicate of government computers."" They are stealthy, the elite of the elite among computer hackers, and not interested in bank account numbers or personal information.""They want intelligence about how an entire system works,"" said Rogers.The former agent warned that there was no strategy for confronting cyberattacks, and national security agencies are hamstrung because of public fears about government surveillance. That's why a congressional cyber bill needed to be passed this year, at least to allow companies to share information.""If we wait another year, we are risking the economy of the United States,"" said Rep. Saxby Chambliss, a Georgia Republican.That, and more public awareness about our vulnerabilities, ought to be an agenda item even in the lame-duck session. Given the size of the threat, there is no partisan reason to oppose it.

191,ADM,"Benghazi Scandal: Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton promised ""unfettered access"" to the Benghazi Accountability Review Board. But it turns out that promise may be as much a lie as the inflammatory video story.We were not impressed by the methods or findings of the Accountability Review Board (ARB) after the terrorist attack on our Benghazi diplomatic mission on Sept. 11, 2012, starting with not interviewing the person where the buck was supposed to stop, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.Shamefully, the ARB report failed to single out any individuals for violating procedures and did not recommend any disciplinary action. Some lower-level State Department officials were blamed for ""performance inadequacies"" but not ""willful misconduct.""In other words, they were merely incompetent and didn't mean for Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans to get murdered by Ansar al-Sharia, a terrorist group with al-Qaida links.Clinton herself escaped any real accountability for Benghazi in the ARB report, despite Amb. Stevens and others warning her office repeatedly that the consulate in Benghazi, surrounded by terrorist training camps, was a terrorist attack waiting to happen.It was her office that repeatedly denied requests for additional security while Marines protected our embassy in Barbados from drunken tourists.The ARB report did attempt to scapegoat Stevens, saying — despite clear warnings including an Aug. 16 memo warning of the dangers and pleading for help — that the embassy Stevens oversaw ""did not demonstrate strong and sustained advocacy with Washington for increased security for Special Mission Benghazi.""Benghazi whistleblower Gregory Hicks, the No. 2 official in Libya at the time of the strike that killed Ambassador Stevens and three other Americans, told the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee that he believed the report had ""let people off the hook.""As we've noted, former Joint Chiefs Chairman Adm.

192,ADM,"Benghazi Scandal: Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton promised ""unfettered access"" to the Benghazi Accountability Review Board. But it turns out that promise may be as much a lie as the inflammatory video story.We were not impressed by the methods or findings of the Accountability Review Board (ARB) after the terrorist attack on our Benghazi diplomatic mission on Sept. 11, 2012, starting with not interviewing the person where the buck was supposed to stop, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.Shamefully, the ARB report failed to single out any individuals for violating procedures and did not recommend any disciplinary action. Some lower-level State Department officials were blamed for ""performance inadequacies"" but not ""willful misconduct.""In other words, they were merely incompetent and didn't mean for Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans to get murdered by Ansar al-Sharia, a terrorist group with al-Qaida links.Clinton herself escaped any real accountability for Benghazi in the ARB report, despite Amb. Stevens and others warning her office repeatedly that the consulate in Benghazi, surrounded by terrorist training camps, was a terrorist attack waiting to happen.It was her office that repeatedly denied requests for additional security while Marines protected our embassy in Barbados from drunken tourists.The ARB report did attempt to scapegoat Stevens, saying — despite clear warnings including an Aug. 16 memo warning of the dangers and pleading for help — that the embassy Stevens oversaw ""did not demonstrate strong and sustained advocacy with Washington for increased security for Special Mission Benghazi.""Benghazi whistleblower Gregory Hicks, the No. 2 official in Libya at the time of the strike that killed Ambassador Stevens and three other Americans, told the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee that he believed the report had ""let people off the hook.""As we've noted, former Joint Chiefs Chairman Adm. Mike Mullen and ARB co-chair Thomas Pickering, authors of this ""independent"" investigation, admitted in Congressional testimony that they regularly briefed Clinton and her advisers on their probe.Mullen at one point had called Hillary Clinton's chief of staff, Cheryl Mills, to give her a heads up after ARB interviewed a potential congressional witness.Mullen and Pickering claimed that they had ""unfettered access"" to Benghazi documents.

194,ADM,"Defense: As debate continues on whether a new Cold War has begun, Russia returns to a practice typical of that era — the probing of U.S. air defenses — a reminder that its strategic forces retain a reach that can't be ignored.Bill Gertz of the Washington Free Beacon has reported that during a recent 10-day period, a mix of Tu-95 Bear H heavy bombers and Tu-142 Bear F maritime reconnaissance aircraft, plus one IL-20 intelligence collection aircraft, probed U.S. air defenses at least 16 times.The Tu-95 is a long-range strike aircraft that can carry nuclear cruise missiles with a range of around 9,400 miles without refueling.Some regard such incursions as routine training and readiness missions. But they come amid a Russian strategic nuclear buildup, documented violations of the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF), the annexation of Crimea and a Ukraine crisis that has included the shoot-down of a passenger jet, presumably by Russian-aligned rebels.""Russia continues to modernize its strategic capabilities across all legs of its triad,"" Adm. Cecil Haney, commander of the U.S. Strategic Command, said at a defense industry breakfast in Washington on June 18.Open-source reporting, he said, ""has recently cited the sea trials of its latest (missile submarine), testing of its newest air-launched cruise missile and modernization of its intercontinental ballistic force to include its mobile capability in that area.""According to the Free Beacon, Haney also noted an increase in Russian strategic nuclear activities that has coincided with the Ukraine crisis and has included the test of six air-launched cruise missiles in a military exercise conducted as a show of force.A Russian Defense Ministry statement on the cruise missile test launches said a Tu-95 bomber ""is capable of destroying the critical stationary assets of an enemy with cruise missiles, in daytime and nighttime, in any weather and in any part of the globe.""So much for that reset button.In June, an American F-22 Raptor and F-15 Eagle intercepted four Tu-95 Bear H bombers as they entered the U.S. northern air defense zone. The Russians came within 50 miles of the Northern California coast before turning west and heading home.Meanwhile, as Russia ramps up its belligerence and preparedness, America continues to disarm.Ignoring Moscow's violations of the INF treaty, the administration recently announced plans to place 50 nuclear missiles in storage as part of its commitment to the New START Treaty signed with Russia.Russia is deploying an R500 cruise missile with a range that violates the INF's prohibition against developing, testing and possessing ballistic or cruise missiles with ranges of 500 to 5,500 miles.In addition to U.S. land-based strategic missile cuts, the Air Force is trimming its bomber fleet from the current deployed total of 93 to 60 — including 19 B-2 stealth bombers. And by 2018, the Navy will reduce the number of deployed and nondeployed submarine-launched ballistic nuclear missiles to 280 from the current 336.Russia is actively testing more than new weapon systems; it's testing U.S. resolve.President Reagan, who advocated the now-abandoned strategy of ""we win, they lose,"" once aired a famous commercial that said there was a bear in the woods. The bear is back, in the woods and off our coast.

210,ADM,"Leroy Grumman was an unlikely player in a game dominated by barnstormers and daredevils, the jaunty young men with pencil mustaches who built America's aviation industry right after World War I.Stoop-shouldered and soft-spoken, Grumman was as shy as he was inseparable from the briar pipe he seemed to hide behind.His experience as a military pilot had left no apparent mark. ""He was very, very reticent,"" his flight instructor said. ""Most of the guys became tougher than hell after they learned to fly. Grumman didn't.""No matter. Grumman had partners who mastered swagger. He focused on designing aircraft so reliable that many models flew largely unchanged through their life span, winning his Long Island plant the nickname Grumman Iron Works.As Vice Adm. John McCain Sr. put it during World War II: ""The name Grumman on a plane is like sterling on silver.""BoomOver four decades, Grumman would build his firm from 16 employees into one of the nation's largest defense contractors, with divisions that manufactured prop planes, jet aircraft, rockets, even canoes and delivery trucks.On July 21, 1969, the world watched tensely as his aeronautic magnum opus delivered Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin to the moon.Northrop Grumman (NOC) is still on the rise, with $24.4 billion in sales last year and a stock that has taken flight by 290% since 2009.Leroy Randle Grumman (1895-1982) was born in Huntington, N.Y., the son of a carriage-shop owner. Roy, as he preferred to be called, had a clear interest in the infant aviation industry by the time he finished high school, telling classmates, ""the final perfection of the airplane"" would be one of man's greatest triumphs.Grumman graduated with an engineering degree from Cornell University in 1916 and applied to the U.S. Navy flight program just as America entered World War I.He served as a flight instructor and test pilot, and, at war's end in 1918, took a job at aviation pioneer Grover Loening's New York City factory.Grumman became fast friends with another Loening employee, Jake Swirbul, an organizational whiz with whom he shared a work ethic and love of flight.When the Loening operation announced a move to Pennsylvania in 1929, the pals took off on their own. Grumman Aeronautical Engineering opened in a former car dealership in the Long Island hamlet of Baldwin on Jan. 2, 1930, with Grumman as chairman and president.Initially, the firm specialized in repairing Loening aircraft, but Grumman soon used his military contacts to land work building pontoons for Navy planes and then a contract for a bi-winged fighter, the first with retractable landing gear.Still, times were tough. The company ran out of cash one week and sent workers home without pay.Scraping ByEarly on, the firm could afford test-flight insurance only by the hour, and company lore suggests employees were encouraged to lug in scrap metal from the roadside.While other companies invested in sophisticated inventory systems, Grumman piled parts into spent oil drums, each marked with a red line a few inches from the bottom. ""When it gets to here,"" a sign advised workers, ""call Joe.""But it was just the kind of company Grumman wanted: small, paternalistic and, if all went well, profitable. In that order.Despite its founder's misgivings, the firm grew steadily, moving to larger quarters in 1931, then again the next year and once more in 1937. Grumman still insisted that the firm should be kept lean and nimble, with no more than 250 workers. An accountant was finally dispatched to tell the boss that the staff had reached 256.Even so, Grumman ruled in a folksy, feet-on-the-desk, door-always-open style, although Swirbul did most of what he called the ""mollycoddling"" of employees.As a result, workers referred to Swirbul as Jake, but Grumman was always Mr. Grumman.Production soared in 1939 as France and England placed orders for Grumman's F-4F Wildcat, a stubby, teardrop-shaped fighter that could reach 330 mph.By 1943, with America in the WWII fight, the Grumman workforce had ballooned from a prewar 700 to more than 25,000, and the company was the primary supplier of aircraft to the Allies.Giving 'Em HellThe firm's next fighter model, the faster F-6 Hellcat, would rule the skies in the Pacific theater, where it was credited with destroying two-thirds of all Japanese planes.The plane's speed and maneuverability were part of the success story, but sheer quantity played an important role as well. At peak production, the company was cranking out over 600 aircraft a month, and Grumman's unique folding wing design, which he'd worked out using an eraser and two paper clips, let U.S. aircraft carriers double the number of planes on board.With Grumman stationed at the drafting table, Swirbul took over the morale effort, organizing activities for workers such as ice-cream socials, band performances and pingpong tournaments. At one point, the firm had over 40 softball teams, with Grumman and other executives playing alongside the most junior riveters.""Grumman was like Michelangelo, and Swirbul was the guy who cut the marble for him,"" one executive said. ""Jake knew how to give the schmaltz to the people.""Sales jumped from $4 million in 1940 to $400 million in 1943, with a percentage going to workers as bonuses. As a result, the company's labor turnover was half that of other wartime manufacturers, and its profit more than double.As World War II ended in 1945, Grumman faced one of his greatest engineering challenges — reducing the staff by 20,000, of which only 126 had expressed any interest in leaving. His solution: Fire everyone, then rehire 5,000 of the most talented and longest tenured. The company pulled it off in 10 days.Grumman stepped down as president in 1946 after losing much of his eyesight from an allergic reaction to a penicillin shot. But he continued on as chairman for 20 more years, pushing the firm into civilian products that included aluminum canoes, delivery vans and Gulfstream prop planes and jets.Government work remained the firm's mainstay, with Grumman winning contracts to produce Navy jets and reconnaissance planes, Postal Service vans and, in 1962, NASA's lunar excursion module.""None of the industry founders got in it for the military business, but none ever turned away from weaponry,"" Wayne Biddle , a Johns Hopkins professor and author of ""Barons of the Sky,"" told IBD. ""They all cherished a necessarily primitive dream of civilian aviation — an airplane in every garage — that turned out to be technically and economically infeasible. So the government became their most reliable customer, with commercial aviation a perennial roller coaster.""Swirbul died from colon cancer in 1960, and Grumman went it alone for an additional six years before relinquishing the chairman's seat, although he remained a director until 1972. The Grumman workforce at that point had swelled to 35,000, surpassing World War II levels and making the company easily Long Island's largest employer.""Everyone talks about Grumman being a big family, and it was,"" said Mike Lisa, a 37-year company veteran. ""There were the top executives, of course, but from the vice presidents down, it was like everyone was an equal on the same playing field. That changed after Leroy retired and passed, but in those days it was a fantastic place to work. Just a great, great place.""Grumman split his retirement between Florida and New York with his wife, Rose, whom he'd married in 1921. They had four children. Grumman's eyesight continued to fail, however, and by 1980, he was blind.Two years later, after what was described as a long illness, he died at age 87.Grumman missed having to witness the decline of the firm he founded, which struggled amid Pentagon cutbacks after the Cold War and sold out to Northrop in 1994, a merger that many defense experts believed should have yielded a Grumman Northrop.It was the confirmation of Grumman's greatest fear, according to his widow. Roy's company, Rose Grumman said, had simply ""got too big.""Said Biddle: ""The lucrative products that epitomized the industry after Leroy Grumman left it would have disgusted him, I think. And by the end of his life, the best young engineers weren't going into aerospace, which was perceived as old-fashioned and corrupt. They were heading for Silicon Valley.""

240,ADM,"For Eugene Fluckey, his deep dive came by way of a president nicknamed ""Silent Cal.""Fluckey (1913-2007) was a retired rear admiral who revolutionized submarine warfare in World War II while in the Pacific. His list of honors made him the most decorated living American at the time of his passing.As a youngster, Fluckey recalled being captivated by the famous words of President Calvin Coolidge: ""Nothing in the world can take the place of persistence. Talent will not: Nothing is more common than unsuccessful men with talent. … Education alone will not: The world is full of educated derelicts. Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent.""Almost instantly Fluckey went from an average student to excelling academically. He later put the president's mantra ""into his own words of 'Put more into life than you expect to get out of it. Drive yourself and lead others,' "" as quoted by Carl LaVO, author of ""The Galloping Ghost: The Extraordinary Life of Submarine Legend Eugene Fluckey.""Fluckey's success is a testament to his maxim. His World War II military service as the young commander of the submarine Barb earned him high honors. Among them: four Navy Crosses and the Medal of Honor (the nation's highest honor).He led the sinking of 85 enemy vessels and more tonnage than any other U.S. submarine captain. ""The Barb had emerged under Fluckey's innovative leadership as one of the great submarines in an undersea offensive that had much to do with winning the Pacific war,"" LaVO wrote.""Fluckey was a no-pain, no-strain, easy-on-the-nerves individual whose good-humored, upbeat personality was infectious,"" said Lt. Tuck Weaver. ""He had a unique and wonderful ability to make all of those around him feel good about life. He made them better than they really were.""Under Fluckey, the Barb and its crew earned six Navy Crosses, 23 Silver Stars, 23 Bronze Stars, a Navy Unit Commendation and Presidential Unit Citations.""What made Admiral Fluckey an exceptional leader was his genuine compassion for his crew,"" said Scot Christenson, communications manager at the U.S. Naval Institute. ""Fluckey was most proud of the fact that none of his crew was lost or wounded on a patrol.""When the watch command passed on the Barb, he had officers say ""SLIPKEEP"" to each other, ""short for 'one slip and it's for keeps,' "" Weaver said. ""It was a constant reminder to stay alert.""Fluckey was born in Washington, D.C. His father was demanding of his four children. He set high expectations for them. He was a great believer in education.Young Eugene loved military history and wanted to serve. His ancestors fought in every American war beginning with the Revolution. A next-door neighbor who'd earned the Medal of Honor encouraged him to attend the U.S. Naval Academy.When the time came, Fluckey had to find a member of Congress to nominate him to the academy. He persisted but was told all slots had been filled. Finally Rep. William Holaday, impressed with his passion to serve in the Navy, pulled some strings.Fluckey enrolled at Columbian Preparatory School to prepare for the rigorous academy entrance exam. The exam was designed to weed out two-thirds of the applicants. Fluckey passed. He entered the Naval Academy in June 1931.He was doing well at the academy. But in fall 1933, he failed his eyesight exam. Midshipmen were required to have minimum 20/20 vision. The nearsighted Fluckey's was 11/20. He would be permitted to finish the school year, but then had to resign.With seven months to save his dream, he painstakingly researched his condition. He became convinced the answer lay in getting three sets of prescription eyeglasses: very mild, strong and ""powerhouse."" Used in combination, it could correct his nearsightedness.He found a doctor to fulfill the prescriptions. He practiced daily. Then Fluckey insisted on being retested. He passed easily. In June 1935, he graduated Annapolis as a U.S. Navy ensign and was assigned the battleship Nevada. In May 1936, he was transferred to the destroyer McCormick.Fluckey disliked the long stretches away from his new wife Marjorie and their infant daughter. Submarine duty would increase family time. It would also offer more pay and a faster promotion track.In June 1938, he reported for instruction at the Submarine School in Connecticut. Upon completion in December, he served on the submarine USS S-42. In June 1941, he was assigned to the USS Bonita at Coco Solo in Panama.After the U.S. entered World II, now Lt. Fluckey completed five war patrols in the Pacific zone on the Bonita. But he grew restless. There was no enemy in sight or combat.In June 1942, he requested graduate instruction in naval engineering at Annapolis to advance his career. In December 1943, he was admitted to the Prospective Commanding Officer's School at the Submarine Base New London. In January 1944, he reported to Commander Submarine Force, Pacific Fleet at Pearl Harbor, where the Barb was stationed.The Barb's skipper, Captain Waterman, knew Fluckey had top ratings from his former submarine skippers. Waterman suggested Fluckey accompany him on the Barb's next patrol, as the prospective future commanding officer. The division commander, Capt. Hensel, was leery of turning over the Barb to Fluckey, who had no combat experience.""Once I had convinced (Hensel) that I knew the job of every single member in the Barb, he gave me his blessing,"" Fluckey wrote in ""Thunder Below!""""He also made it a priority to get to know each member of his new crew and tutored them in all aspects of submarining,"" LaVO noted.He ""had a wonderful willingness to try new ideas,"" said executive officer Robert McNitt.As lieutenant commander, Fluckey put into practice combat philosophies he'd developed. He viewed submarines ""as a kind of torpedo boat that ought to operate on the surface, where it could use its fast speed to outmaneuver ships in hit-and-run attacks and could dive quickly when planes approached, only to pop back up minutes later,"" LaVO wrote.""You see more ships and sink more ships,"" Fluckey said, referring to a periscope extended on the surface.On Jan. 8, 1945, the Barb sank a large Japanese ammunition ship. On Jan. 25, Fluckey located a concentration of more than 30 Japanese ships in China's Mamkwan Harbor.He ordered the Barb's torpedoes launched at 3,000-yard range, obtaining eight direct hits on six targets and exploded an ammunition ship. On the Barb's way home it sank a large Japanese freighter.Fluckey earned the Medal of Honor for his efforts. His citation lauded him for ""conspicuous gallantry … at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty.""Overall ""what gave the Barb its edge was ingenuity, the quality of its personnel, careful planning, tenacity, and avoiding undue risks. Above all the boat did the unexpected,"" LaVO said.""The Barb was never in competition with anybody but herself,"" Fluckey wrote. ""We were determined on each patrol to do better than the last one.""Revolutionized submarine warfare in World War II. Received four Navy Crosses and the Medal of Honor.Overcame: Resistance to introducing unconventional submarine tactics.Lesson: Don't blindly accept the status quo.""We don't have problems; we have solutions.""

242,ADM,"A nine-day-old strike by Brazilian truck drivers is beginning to affect global commodity markets as soybean traders delay shipments and the country's vast sugar industry shuts down more of its processing plants.Chinese food giant Cofco International temporarily suspended soybean shipments from Santos, Brazil's largest port, because of a shortage of cargoes for export, according to people with direct knowledge of the matter, who asked not to be identified because the information hasn't been published. All of Sao Paulo state's sugar-cane mills will suspend operations until May 29 amid a shortage of diesel, needed to power plants, according to industry group Unica.While many blockades have been lifted and the government has signed decrees aimed at getting the truckers back to work, protests continued on Monday and many businesses and public schools remained shut. Road blockades are easing on Tuesday, but protests remain in almost all the country.The impact on sugar and soybeans will probably be ""short-lived,"" said Warren Patterson, a commodities strategist at ING Group. ""The Brazilian government has already cut diesel prices in a bid to end the strike.""Petrobras is also coming under pressure as it's still unclear if the state-run oil firm will partly foot the bill for fuel subsidies offered by the government to end the strike.Cofco doesn't have enough soybeans to fill a vessel expected to dock on Monday, one of the people said. A Cofco spokesman declined to comment on the disruption.Other soy exporters at Santos used inventories over the weekend to keep shipments moving but the amount now remaining is very low, the people said. Archer-Daniels-Midland (ADM), another major processor of soybeans, said May 25 it had halted or slowed some operations after running out of storage space.Brazil is the world's largest soybean exporter and its supplies have assumed an even greater importance in recent weeks after China, the biggest buyer, threatened to impose tariffs on supplies from the U.S., the second-largest shipper. Delays to Brazilian exports may encourage Chinese importers to take more U.S. beans.Brazil is home to the world's largest sugar industry, and most of its mills have halted sugar-cane harvesting amid a lack of fuel. Copersucar, Brazil's top sugar shipper, said Friday it may declare force majeure on some contracts because the strike has depleted inventories at its terminal at Santos.Biosev SA, the Louis Dreyfus Co. unit that's Brazil's second-biggest sugar producer, said it suspended operations at two cane mills, and others would run out of fuel in the next two days. Cane processing in the center-south region may be cut by 10.9 million tons in the second half of May because of the strike, INTL FCStone Inc. said Monday in a report.Sugar futures traded in New York climbed 6.9% last week, this year's biggest weekly gain, and were 0.6% higher on Tuesday morning.""Brazil's sugar production might ultimately be little affected for the 2018 season,"" said Tobin Gorey, a strategist at Commonwealth Bank of Australia. ""But near term, some of the chain of promises in the physical sugar market will not be fulfilled, and that generally creates a scramble to buy.""The number of vessels waiting to dock in Santos increased to 18 on May 25 from 10 on May 21, when the strike began, according to data from shipping agency Williams. The flow of trucks to the port was still halted Monday and the delivery of goods to export terminals has been reduced as a result, according to the port authority.In Paranagua Port, the second largest in Brazil for grain shipments, five vessels that were supposed to carry about 300,000 tons of soy meal haven't been able to sail in the past seven days because there's not enough of the commodity to load them, a press official from the port authority said Monday.Another three vessels slated to transport pulp and sugar also failed to depart from the port because of a shortage of supplies. Soybean shipments from Paranagua haven't been affected so far as exporters have used inventories stored at the port's terminals.Coffee shipments are halted at most Brazilian port terminals, Nelson Carvalhaes, president of exporters group CeCafe, told reporters. Plants that supply soybean oil, biodiesel and orange juice plants have also had their operations suspended, as their warehouses are full.JBS, the world's largest meat company, has halted all domestic slaughtering of cattle, hogs and chicken because it can't get product to customers nor receive deliveries of feed, according to a person familiar with the matter.""Beef production levels in Brazil are now close to zero,"" Hyberville Neto, an analyst at Scot consultancy, said in a phone interview. ""The cattle market has been completely frozen since Thursday.""Meat exporters group ABPA said supplies of animal feed to chicken producers will gradually return to normal in the next few days. Its members have requested police protection for a planned convoy to transport meat products to Paranagua for export.

243,ADM,"The F-35 is preparing for key operational tests that will allow Lockheed Martin (LMT) to begin full-rate production on the stealth fighter and massively boost its growth.XAcquisition rules require the completion of combat testing certification, or Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&E), before Lockheed can crank out F-35s at full tilt.The F-35 underwent cold-weather testing at Eielson Air Force Base, Alaska, in February, as part pre-IOT&E activity. Then last month, the F-35 went through more pre-IOT&E tests at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif., to evaluate close air support and combat search and rescue capabilities.Actual IOT&E, which includes rigorous combat testing, is scheduled to start in September (more than a year behind schedule) and finish by May 2019. That event will also test the F-35's 3F software package, which provides 100% of the coding needed for full warfighting capability.It will also pit the F-35 against the venerable A-10 in a close air support matchup that Congress mandated amid a fierce debate over the A-10's future.The F-35 is supposed to fill the close air support role left by the A-10, but critics say the stealthy fighter doesn't have the same amount of firepower or survivability in combat and instead called on the Air Force to put off the planned retirement of the so-called Warthog.Lockheed has a lot riding on the tests.The F-35 program is key to Lockheed's growth as it accounts for about 25% of total revenue. The company has been steadily boosting its production rate, but getting to full output would nearly double the pace.Lockheed delivered 66 F-35s last year, and sees production and delivery of 91 jets this year. By 2023, the company expects to reach 160 jets per year.Other defense stocks will also see a lift when F-35 output jumps. Northrop Grumman (NOC) builds the center fuselage and mission planning software, United Technologies (UTX) makes the engines, and Raytheon (RTN) is modifying its missiles and other weapons for the jet.Lockheed and Raytheon rose 0.5% in the stock market today while Northrop sank 0.55% and United Tech climbed 1.55%.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

We could. They choose not to, and that's a negotiating tactic,"" Vice Adm. Mat Winter, F-35 Program Executive Officer, said in February.Meanwhile, defense officials are pressuring Lockheed to find ways to lower the expected life-cycle expenses of the F-35 fleet, which will cost about $1.1 trillion to operate and maintain through 2077, Bloomberg reported in April.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN: Defense And Aerospace Stocks To Watch And Industry NewsWhy Air Force Is Rushing To Fly A Sixth-Generation Fighter JetHypersonic Weapons: The Biggest Warfighting Disrupter Since Stealth Is Coming

245,ADM,"America is perched atop a time bomb. The explosion of federal debt to more than $20 trillion will have real consequences. Deep down, we Americans agree with economist and presidential advisor Herb Stein: ""If something can't go on forever, it will stop."" Yet the U.S. Congress refuses to reduce spending. Why? Because the American public refuses to demand congressional action.There are two primary aspects to our spending crisis: the staggering explosion of federal debt and the accompanying increased dependency upon the government by much of our population. While most of the debate is couched in fiscal terms, the heart of the question is really moral. Both are deadly serious.Since the onset of the Great Society's War on Poverty in the mid-'60s, the U.S. has spent — progressives would contend ""invested"" — more than $15 trillion in means-tested entitlement programs. Between 1960 and 2010, federal entitlement spending increased from 19% to 43% of annual federal spending. In 1960, government entitlement spending was a mere $24 billion — or $134 per citizen. By 2019, federal entitlement spending had soared to $7,200 (or approximately $1,000 in 1960 dollars) for every American.These programs were designed not only to eliminate poverty but to eradicate the root causes of poverty. The results? The overall poverty rate in 1966 stood at 14.7%, while in 2013 it stood at 14.5% — basically unchanged. By any standard of measurement, these programs were a disastrous ""investment.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe government has massively redistributed income and, because this spending has been financed with deficits, shifted the burden of this redistribution to future generations — with no reduction in poverty.As former U.S. Budget Director and Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels has written, ""As a people, we have discovered the ability to vote ourselves largesse from the federal treasury in such vast quantities that we are destroying our own chances at prosperity.""When interest rates inevitably rise to more normal historical levels, the debt service burden will prove massive. Lest you think this is a partisan issue: Democrat Erskine Bowles, a former White House chief of staff, has called the pending debt crisis ""the most predictable crisis in American history.""Adm. Michael Mullen, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, warned, ""The most significant threat to our national security is our debt.""Many years ago, President Calvin Coolidge correctly discerned the moral dimension of government policy when he spoke these words : ""I am for economy in government not to save money, but to save people."" Profound. Yet we Americans have largely ignored his insight.As Coolidge foreshadowed, the economic consequences are not the most tragic part of this story. Former U.S. Sen. Tom Coburn wrote, ""Big government's false promise of easy living and smug security has wreaked havoc not only in the nation's finances, but also in the American ideals of self-reliance and human dignity.""We have, in American Enterprise Institute President Arthur Brooks' words, ""Become a nation of takers — not makers."" Over the years, millions of Americans have become ""takers."" In 1950, only one in 25 Americans received any government aid, but by 2012, it was one in three. Today a majority of American households includes at least one family member receiving entitlement benefits from the government.Brooks rightly concludes, ""The fact that we have hardly moved the needle on earned success after spending trillions of dollars is not merely a failure of public policy. It is the greatest moral scandal of our time.""J.D. Vance, in his best-selling book ""Hillbilly Elegy,"" poignantly portrays the devastating effects of well-intentioned entitlement programs. Millions of ""Rust Belt Americans"" have been stripped of their natural resilience and productivity and become trapped in a life of pessimism, hopelessness and despair.The legacy of big government is about far more than exploding debt. It is about the loss of individual freedom. The United States now stands at No. 16 in the world ranking of economic freedom, a shocking reversal of our No. 2 ranking only 20 years ago. We have too often been willing to trade our reliance on free markets and individual freedom for government entitlements.In ""The Road to Serfdom,"" Frederick Hayek warned of the insidious policies of Big Government that have always led to serfdom. No matter how benevolent the aims of government, the loss of individual freedom is the debilitating result of increased governmental control. Hayek argued that policies of individual freedom and free markets are ""the only truly progressive policies.""Now Congress has passed and President Trump has signed a $1.3 trillion omnibus budget bill. With this most recent installment in America's sad descent into this fiscal and moral crisis, our deficit is projected to reach $850 billion for 2018.Departing House Speaker Paul Ryan has voiced his determination to tackle entitlement spending in 2018. But will the Senate and the president join in? The American public must demand spending reductions from our elected leaders — in 2018 — before it's too late. Fiscal responsibility and moral rectitude demand it.Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market? Start with IBD University.

Sounds like good preparation for battling the killer VA bureaucracy.Jackson also shares Trump's vision of putting vets in the driver's seat about their own medical care. Here's what Jackson can learn from his predecessors' failures.Lesson 1: Make vets the priority, not protecting the VA bureaucracy. Shulkin refused to do that.Trump has pledged to fix the Veterans Choice Program so vets can see private doctors when they decide it's necessary. VCP was created in 2014 after revelations that sick vets were dying on wait lists at VA hospitals. VCP is supposed to allow vets to get private care if they live far from a VA facility or have waited too long. But VCP's red tape makes seeing an outside doctor almost impossible. That's deliberate. Sen. Bernie Sanders, who co-authored VCP legislation, relies on union campaign contributions and will do just about anything to protect union jobs at the VA. Keeping vets trapped at the VA with no alternatives is a job protection racket.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseShulkin was part of that racket, too. He misled Trump and Congress with double talk about reforming VCP ""in a way that will work for veterans and work for VA."" But protecting VA bureaucracy shouldn't be a consideration, when vets' lives are at stake.Shulkin showed his true colors when Congress passed last month's big spending package. Trump and congressional Republicans had pushed hard to include VA reforms helping vets see outside doctors.But the key person to sell this to Congress was Shulkin, and he equivocated, allowing Democrats to block its passage. It was a setback for Trump and vets. No wonder Shulkin was canned days later — not because of flimsy travel expense abuse allegations.Lesson 2: Cut wait times in half at the VA.Shulkin claimed success in reducing waits, but that's questionable. VA bureaucrats are still fudging the numbers, according to the inspector general.Here's a remedy. A whopping 47 percent of VA health care users are 65 or older. They need angioplasty and bypass surgery like other seniors. They use the VA to avoid Medicare's out-of-pocket expenses, because their median annual income is only $24,000. Picking up their copays would cost very little and encourage them to use Medicare instead of the VA Bingo, and it would cut VA wait times by nearly half, making room for younger vets to get combat-related care only the VA can provide.Lesson 3: Don't count on VA bureaucrats to fess up when things go wrong. Jackson should use unannounced audits to uncover dangerous conditions at medical facilities, instead of trusting officials to report them up the chain of command.An inspector general report last month exposed ""a breakdown of core services"" at medical centers under Shulkin's command. At the Washington, D.C., facility, under Shulkin's nose, patients were needlessly overexposed to anesthesia due to inventory mismanagement. After patients were put under, surgeons sometimes discovered they were out of equipment and had to race across the street to borrow it from another hospital or reschedule the procedure. Shulkin claims he could ""not recall"" ever being notified of such problems. He expected to be notified?Pundits are predicting a confirmation battle. The smart money should be on Jackson. He's combat tested. Disregard the partisan drivel about his lack of experience running a big organization. It's coming from the same people who had no problem making a community organizer the president.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:Another VA Scandal: Clinic Caught Falsifying Wait Times For VeteransGood News For Veterans: Trump Tells Hundreds Of VA Workers 'You're Fired!Other columns by Betsy McCaughey

251,ADM,"ARLINGTON, Va. — Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-35 is on schedule to perform intense combat testing and will face the Cold War-era A-10 in a close air support face-off sometime this year.Vice Adm. Mat Winter, director of the Joint Strike Fighter program office, told reporters at a roundtable Wednesday that the F-35 will face the A-10 either as part of a close air support test scheduled to start in April or as part of its major full combat testing certification, which is on schedule to start in September and be finished by May 2019.Congress mandated the tests amid a fierce debate over the A-10's future. While warfighters cherish its ability to rain down massive firepower to support troops on the ground, the Air Force wants to retire the aging fleet to save money and meet constricted budget requirements.The F-35 was supposed to fill the close air support role left by the A-10, but critics say the stealthy fighter doesn't have the same amount of firepower or survivability in combat and instead called on the Air Force to maintain the so-called Warthog.For now, the A-10 is here to stay, as the Air Force asked for money in its 2019 budget request to replace the attack plane's wings.Lockheed shares closed down 1% at 352.44 on the stock market today.Sign Up For Free IBD Newsletters: Market Prep | Tech ReportBack in 2015 the Pentagon's Office of Operational Test and Evaluation suggested a fly-off between the two planes, but Air Force officials called any potential test ""silly,"" saying the two planes perform different functions and the F-35's stealth capabilities allow it to enter high-threat environments.The F-35's close air support test is scheduled for April and will take place predominantly at Edwards Air Force Base in Southern California. It will follow a cold weather test completed earlier this month in Alaska.Both tests are precursors for the major Initial Operational Test and Evaluation, which the F-35 must pass before Lockheed can start full-rate production on the plane.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN: Why Air Force Is Rushing To Fly A Sixth-Generation Fighter JetPentagon's No. 2 Has This Confusing 'Mindset' On Lockheed's F-35Hypersonic Weapons: The Biggest Warfighting Disrupter Since Stealth Is Coming

253,ADM,"Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-35 could be the first missile defense system to target intercontinental ballistic missiles in the key boost phase, according to a report from Aviation Week, as North Korea develops missiles that could reach deeper into U.S. territory.X Last week, Pyongyang launched an ICBM that went higher any other missile it's fired, with the apogee indicating an ability to hit the U.S. East Coast and the West Coast.But Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., said last month that it's possible for the F-35 to shoot down nuclear missiles from North Korea or Iran with its Raytheon (RTN) AIM-120 Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missiles (AMRAAMs) just seconds after takeoff.""It's like an act of God,"" Hunter said. ""You have F-35s, you have AMRAAMs, and you can shoot these things down as they go up.""Boeing's (BA) F-15 could also be used if it had the right sensors but the stealthy fifth-generation F-35 already has key sensors installed, Aviation Week noted.In particular, Northrop Grumman (NOC) has developed the F-35's infrared AN/AAQ-37 sensors that serve as an aircraft and missile warning system and the jet's fire control radar. The company has been testing the sensors on ballistic missiles for several years, according to the report.Tom Lawhead, head of the Air Force Joint Strike Fighter Integration Office, agrees with Hunter and told Aviation Week that the technology is feasible with the F-35. Northrop would need three years from starting integration to achieve full missile defense potential.Northrop has tested a ground-based system coupled with a radar-enabled aircraft in 2014 as a proof of concept, and Missile Defense Agency Deputy Director Rear Adm. Jon Hill told Avation Week that the F-35 along with lasers and drones are under consideration for the  Trump administration's Ballistic Missile Defense Review.Lockheed shares dipped 0.5% on the stock market today. Raytheon, Boeing and Northrop fell 0.9%.IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now? A good starting point is to regularly review screens that highlight the top-rated equities.Boost-phase defense has been the goal of missile defense experts for decades, as existing systems are geared toward latter phases of a flight path.Raytheon's Patriot system is useful against conventional weapons and works by intercepting missiles in the low atmosphere in their final approach toward the target, or terminal phase.Lockheed's Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system is designed to shoot down short- and medium-range ballistic missiles in the terminal phase as well.But nuclear missiles will deliver multiple warheads and decoys making terminal defenses less effective.The Air Force has tested a laser that's mounted in a Boeing 747 — to shoot down missiles in their boost phase — but the program was canceled for being too expensive. Drones could do the same job, but analysts aren't sure the technology is mature enough.RELATED: Report Doubts Effectiveness Of Raytheon's Patriot In Recent AttackAs North Korea Threat Looms, Here's How U.S. Missile Defense WorksRaytheon Hits Buy Zone As Romania Buys Patriot; U.S. Arms Sales SurgeThese Defense Giants Poised To Gain From New Missile Defense MovesDefense And Aerospace Stocks To Watch And Industry News

254,ADM,"Edward Raymer nearly died on his first dive to examine the USS Arizona, sunk during the Dec. 7, 1941, Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.Raymer was the first to submerge to start the process of raising the battleship and retrieving what turned out to be 1,177 bodies, roughly half the total killed in the deadliest attack by foreigners in the United States before Sept. 11, 2001. The techniques and technology to do this were largely untested. Underwater, the fuel oil leaking from the ship made it impossible to see anything, and there was constant danger from falling and jagged objects and unexploded ordnance.""An external survey of the Arizona revealed a hole presumably made by an unexploded torpedo or bomb,"" wrote Raymer in ""Descent into Darkness."" Raymer had to ""find the missile and attach a lock on the propeller to prevent it from arming itself and exploding. No salvage work could begin until it was rendered safe.""Weighed down by a 196-pound diving suit, Raymer was feeling his way past corpses when his air supply tube got caught on a machine and cut off his oxygen. He had two minutes to retrace his steps to find the problem and be pulled up before the air in his helmet ran out. By the time he reached the surface, he had blacked out from carbon dioxide poisoning.Removing the bodies on the Arizona was a particularly gruesome task. It had suffered too much damage, so the topside structure was cut off and a memorial was built over the hull. A marble wall is inscribed with the names of the men who died on the ship.The work he directed would be nearly as fatal as front-line combat, made more hazardous as his men moved on to the battle sites of the Pacific War. The equipment and methods whose development Raymer headed are still used today.Raymer was born in 1920, the youngest of three siblings, in Riverside, Calif., east of Los Angeles. After graduating from high school in 1939, there were few jobs, so he joined the Navy hoping to become a pilot, while learning welding in the ship repair unit in California and Hawaii.After his dream of flying wasn't realized, he signed up to go to pilot school for the Royal Air Force after his discharge in July 1941. However, the program was canceled by the U.S. after pressure on Congress from Charles Lindbergh and his America First organization. Instead, Raymer was transferred in May to the destroyer base in San Diego, where he volunteered to take a one-month diving course.""Diving school on the USS Ortolan, a submarine-rescue vessel, proved to be exciting and challenging to me and the other eight men in the class,"" Raymer wrote. ""We learned how to ascend, descend and move through thick mud. We learned to use an underwater gas-cutting torch, a stud driver to fasten steel plates together, and how to dig trenches in the mud.""After a morning softball game, Raymer and his crew were relaxing when the news came over the radio that Pearl Harbor had been bombed. That night, the divers, ages 21 to 26, were flown to Hawaii.The scene was a shock as they landed: Huge billowing clouds of black smoke from the burning oil and 30 ships sunk or badly damaged, while 347 aircraft were destroyed or unable to fly. The first task of the newly formed salvage unit was to help rescue efforts, and they put their equipment on a sampan and headed for the USS Nevada, which had not been fully sunk, unlike the other battleships. Raymer, a metalsmith first class, was made the chief machinist under the command of Lt. H.E. Haynes.""The crusty old diving officer cautioned us that no one could identify all the dangers because few divers had experienced diving inside a battle-damaged ship strewn with wreckage,"" Raymer wrote. ""Because of the floating oil, sediment and debris, underwater lights would be useless. … This would require us to develop a keen sense of feel, great manual dexterity with tools, and a high degree of hand-to-brain coordination. We would be required to devise our own safety precautions.""Working with civilian divers, salvage engineers and Naval Shipyard personnel, they began the first of innumerable 13-hour days hammering the sides of the USS Nevada, listening for responses, and occasionally finding someone alive. On Dec. 20, they started clearing out the ship's insides with the goal of returning it to duty as soon as possible. They quickly discovered how difficult it was to move ammunition and use welding tools without triggering explosions, with each new obstacle forcing them to rework traditional salvage methods and tools. Two members of the team were killed instantly when they opened a compartment filled with poison gas.The Nevada was so badly damaged that the commander of the Pacific Fleet, Adm. Chester Nimitz, did not think its salvage possible. Yet the battleship was raised and repairs completed in October 1942. It would support the Normandy landings in June 1944 and play a role in the Pacific battles of Iwo Jima and Okinawa in 1945.The California was refloated in March 1942 and would win seven battle stars in the Pacific campaign, sinking a Japanese battleship at Surigao Strait, part of the Battle of Leyte Gulf in the Philippines, the largest naval action of the war.In August 1942, Raymer and six other salvors joined the 100-strong crew of the Navy fleet tug USS Seminole, bound for the Pacific war. They first dived at Tongatabu, Tonga, to retrieve equipment lost in a storm and were startled by what they could see in the crystal-clear water — including a new hazard, sharks. The damaged battleship South Dakota and carrier Saratoga soon arrived for repairs. In October, they were dispatched to Guadalcanal to pick up survivors of two sunken ships.Before the end of the month, the Seminole itself was attacked and sunk, though it lost only one crew member. On Guadalcanal, Raymer and his team fought off crocodiles, snakes, bloodsucking leeches and malaria-carrying mosquitoes while enduring nightly shelling.The salvors arrived back in Hawaii in April 1943 and Raymer was promoted to chief petty officer in January 1944. He spent his final two months in the field removing ammunition from the Utah (another team member was killed in the process) and helping to develop a way to replace ship propellers while they were in the water, so they did not have to be dry-docked.The USS West Virginia's repairs and modernization were completed in July and it would lead the battle line at Leyte and fight at Luzon, Iwo Jima, and Okinawa.""One of the most effective traits of good leaders is example, but it is often difficult to achieve when the task at hand requires special skills or inordinate amounts of courage,"" Thomas J. Cutler, author of ""The U.S. Naval Institute on Naval Leadership"" and ""The Parent's Guide to the U.S. Navy,"" told IBD. ""Never one to shy away from challenging circumstances, Edward Raymer was both an important participant and exemplary leader, never asking his men to do things he himself would not do, leading them to impressive heights as they descended into the dangerous depths.""Raymer received the Navy and Marine Corps Medal from Nimitz for leading the salvage unit and went on to help secure ships at the bottom of the ocean as part of the Bikini Atoll nuclear tests in 1946. Four years later, on a visit to Riverside, he met his future wife, Marilyn, on a blind date and they would have three sons, Christopher, Marshall and Terry.""He wanted to retire in 1966 to allow the boys to stay in high school, but because of the Vietnam War his request was turned down and we moved to the Philippines,"" Raymer's wife, Marilyn, told IBD. ""That turned out to be a great experience for our family and our overseas experiences made us very patriotic.""Raymer retired with the rank of commander in 1969 and ""Descent into Darkness"" was published in 1996. He was working on his postwar memoir when he died a year later, Marilyn said.""At times, leadership requires individuals to perform extraordinary acts under extraordinary circumstances,"" said Rear Adm. Terry McKnight (Ret.), author of ""Pirate Alley: Commanding Task Force 151 Off Somalia."" ""After the Pearl Harbor attack, the Navy had to act quickly to salvage these ships and restore the armada to fight the Imperial Empire. It turned to Raymer to lead the team in some of the most demanding operations anyone could possibly face and to develop the strategies and techniques to return these battle wagons to full combat readiness. Without his exceptional leadership, the Navy's success in the Pacific theater might have taken another path.""Headed a team that raised battleships and recovered bodies at Pearl Harbor.Overcame: Lack of equipment and experience to do complex recovery operations.Lesson: Where there are new challenges, pioneers will think in innovative ways to create whatever is needed to overcome them.""Divers marched to different drummers, but all of us were united by love of country and a desire to serve our nation.""MORE HEROES OF PEARL HARBOR:Peter Tomich's Sacrifice Saved Hundreds At Pearl HarborDonald Kirby Ross Was Prepared At Pearl HarborCassin Young's Courage Made A Difference At Pearl HarborMervyn Bennion Stood Tall To The End At Pearl HarborSamuel Fuqua's Fiery Courage At Pearl Harbor

255,ADM,"North Korean Nukes: Why did President Trump suddenly go wheels-up on a grueling, 12-day Asian tour? As new polling data suggests, it might be because North Korea has suddenly emerged as a major nuclear threat in the eyes of most Americans.In the November IBD/TIPP Poll, taken from Oct. 26 to Nov. 3,  73% said they were ""very concerned"" or ""somewhat concerned"" about the ""possibility of a nuclear attack by North Korea against the U.S. or its allies."" The national poll of 917 adult Americans has a margin of error of +/-3.7 percentage points.Recent news developments no doubt feed this growing fear.On Sunday, Rear Adm. Michael J. Dumont of the Joint Chiefs of Staff said that it would take a ground invasion of North Korea to destroy its nuclear weapons capability. Dumont noted that Seoul, the South Korean capital that lies just 35 miles from the Demilitarized Zone, would be vulnerable to attack by artillery, rockets and ballistic missiles in the event of a war. Seoul is home to 25 million people.Meanwhile, just days ago, an unnamed U.S. official told CNN that North Korea is ""working on an advanced version of its existing KN-20 intercontinental ballistic missile that could potentially reach the United States."" The totalitarian regime of Kim Jong Un launched its first ICBM just last July, so the progress is rapid. An ICBM could potentially reach the U.S. in a little over half an hour.Based on this escalation, blunt-talking U.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis last month made clear what the U.S. policy was: ""I cannot imagine a condition under which the United States would accept North Korea as a nuclear power,"" he said.So a very clear and bright line has been drawn for all to see.Americans seem to understand this. While on many issues these days there are often sharp, even divisive, splits in general opinion based on party affiliation, that's not the case with North Korea's nuclear threat, the IBD/TIPP Poll's results show.Among Democrats, for instance, 86% said they were concerned, vs. just 14% saying they weren't. But Republicans weren't too far behind, with 69% expressing concern about a North Korean nuke, compared with 31% not being concerned. For independents, it was 65% concerned vs. 35% not concerned.A surprising share of those queried also believe that a military conflict between the U.S. is ""inevitable."" Some 27% said the U.S. and North Korea will go to war — 37% of Republicans, 22% of Democrats and 25% of independents.That explains Trump's tough talk on Monday, as he began the first leg of his nearly two-week tour. Speaking with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe next to him, Trump referred to the ""North Korean menace"" and vowed that ""the era of strategic patience is over.""""The regime continues development of its unlawful weapons programs, including its illegal nuclear tests and outrageous launches of ballistic missiles directly overly Japanese territory,"" Trump said. ""We will not stand for that.""Americans have good reason to be worried about the totalitarian North Korean regime's nuclear schemes. Given the brutal nature of the murderous Kim regime and its potential instability, a nuclear North Korea is a nonstarter.President Trump is expected to meet with Chinese officials and possibly also Russian leader Vladimir Putin during his trip. No item on the agenda will be more important than North Korea's burgeoning nuclear program.American presidents of both parties have kicked this can down the road for decades, leaving it for someone else to resolve. Trump is the first to really take it seriously. As we've said before, China is North Korea's main patron. We hope, and expect, Trump will mince no words in expressing his disappointment over China failing to leash its mad dog in Pyongyang.Americans might be surprised to know that the U.S. is already technically at war with North Korea, since the hostilities of the Korean War ended with a cease-fire — not a formal end of the state of war. For one side of the conflict — North Korea — that state of war is very real. Seeing Kim's growing nuclear program, Americans are also starting to realize the threat is real.RELATED:No, North Korea's Nuclear Threat Isn't Fake News North Korea's Nuclear Threat To The U.S. Is Real — And China's Largely To Blame Trump's Trade War With China Is War On North Korea By Other Means IBD/TIPP Poll Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

256,ADM,"It is said that America's armed forces have been stressed by 16 years of constant warfare, the longest such in the nation's history. For the Air Force, however, the high tempo of combat operations began 26 years ago, with enforcement of the no-fly zone in Iraq after Desert Storm. With an acute pilot shortage, particularly in the fighter pilot community, and with a shortfall approaching 4,000 among maintenance and staffing personnel, the service is, as Air Force Secretary Heather Wilson says, ""too small for what the nation expects of it.""At the Air University here at Maxwell Air Force Base, officers are studying what expectations are reasonable. Technological sophistication — America's and that of near-peer adversaries (Russia and China) — is changing capabilities. This, and the political and military primitivism of some adversaries (e.g., the Islamic State), are reshaping the environment in which air power operates, and the purposes of this power. The traditional U.S. approach to warfare — dominance achieved by mass of force produced by the nation's industrial might — is of limited relevance.Gen. Steven L. Kwast, president of the Air University, recalls that Gen. George Marshall, who in 1939 became Army chief of staff, asked a two-star general in the horse cavalry how he planned to adapt to the challenges of tanks and planes. The two-star, who replied that the horses should be carried to the front in trailers so they would arrive rested, was retired in 1942.Kwast notes that in 1940 the Navy was preparing to devote most of its budget to building the sort of battleships that had been ""kings of the sea"" since President Theodore Roosevelt sent the Great White Fleet around the world. After Pearl Harbor the Navy turned toward aircraft carriers and away from big battleships. Twenty years earlier, Gen. Billy Mitchell had used an airplane to sink a battleship, but changing the trajectory of military thinking, and hence procurement, often requires changing a service's viscous culture.Kwast wonders: What are the horses and battleships of our age? Some say: Aircraft carriers, because they are too vulnerable to long-range weapons and too expensive for the budget constraints of America's entitlement state. Also, some say, remotely piloted aircraft, aka drones, flown from, say, Nevada are many times cheaper than most manned aircraft, and are capable of loitering over a contested area to conduct ""find, fix, finish"" missions for up to 48 hours without refueling.When military air power was born a century ago, just before World War I, the hope was that it would save casualties by preventing what that war quickly became, a slog of attrition. But in World War II, air power was used to attack civilians in order to destroy morale and damage the enemy's capacity to wage industrial-era war. Now, says Kwast, war is shaped by the digital networked age, where power does not flow in industrial-age channels. U.S. forces can spend millions to kill one high-value target in Syria, where the enemy, for a few hundred dollars, can recruit 10 men who flow up from entry-level positions.Only the United States has the capacity to be, as retired Adm. Gary Roughead and Kori Schake say in a Brookings Institution study, ""guarantors of the global commons — the seaways and airways, and now the cyber conduits."" Nuclear weapons are still essentially a 70-year-old technology delivered by a 60-year-old technology, ballistic missiles. Before long there will be space-based sensors and directed energy (DE) weapons — war at the speed of light, 186,000 miles a second. It is preferable to shoot down an enemy's cruise missiles, which cost a few hundred thousand dollars, with space-, ground- and sea-based DE weapons rather than with defensive missile interceptors costing up to $20 million apiece.The Air University's military intellectuals are impressive enough to be forgiven for using ""architect"" as a verb: Hitler was defeated using great violence, but it would be better to architect responses to threats by projecting power in ways that are less expensive and much more efficient than even today's precision-guided weapons — never mind World War II gravity bombs, 80% of which fell at least 1,000 feet from their targets.Viewed from the not-too-distant future, Kwast says, today's Air Force, although it is a century distant from the Flanders trenches, might seem to have dug into the equivalent of trench warfare by operating below the altitude of 70,000 feet. Such thoughts are considered here at a university where ""trigger warnings"" and ""safe spaces"" are serious matters.
"
257,ADM,"Russia Probe: The latest ""bombshell"" report — at least in the minds of journalists — is that special counsel Robert Mueller is allegedly investigating whether President Trump obstructed justice. The significance of this is open to debate.Based on unnamed sources (naturally), the Washington Post reported late Wednesday — in a story ominously headlined ""Special counsel is investigating Trump for possible obstruction of justice "" — that Mueller is ""interviewing senior intelligence officials as part of a widening probe,"" and that this ""marks a major turning point"" in the investigation.But even the Trump-hating New York Times was more careful than the hyperventilating Post in how it framed the story, saying the interviews were only ""hinting"" at such an inquiry.In any case, it's hardly surprising that Mueller would talk to these officials. Democrats and the press have been screaming about obstruction nonstop since former FBI Director James Comey's testimony, which, they said, ""laid out a road map for an obstruction charge.""And the Senate Intelligence Committee had been asking questions about it. Had Mueller not followed up, the same people now saying that this is a ""major turning point"" in the investigation would be attacking Mueller for not doing his job.But it's important to note that, despite the fervent wishes of the ""resistance,"" this news by itself doesn't mean anything. Mueller is just as likely to drop the matter after conducting these interviews as he is to pursue an obstruction charge.Keep in mind that two of the people Mueller is said to be interviewing — Dan Coats, the director of national intelligence, and Adm. Michael S. Rogers, the head of the National Security Agency — have already testified before the Senate Intelligence Committee that they didn't feel pressure from the White House to drop investigations into supposed Russian meddling.What's more, Comey himself said he didn't believe Trump was trying to stop the broader Russian investigation when he talked to Comey about Mike Flynn.Here's the exchange from last week's hearing that everyone pushing the obstruction story seems to have missed:Sen. Marco Rubio: Let's talk about the general Russia investigation, OK? Page 6 of your testimony you say, the first thing you say is, he asked what we could do to, quote, unquote, lift the cloud, the general Russia investigation, you responded, we are investigating the matter as quickly as we could and there would be great benefit if we didn't find anything for having done the work well. He agreed. He emphasized the problems it was causing him. He agreed it'd be great to have an investigation, all the facts came out and we found nothing. He agreed that would be ideal, but this cloud is still messing up my ability to do the rest of my agenda. Is that an accurate assessment?Comey: Yes, sir. He went farther than that. He said, and if some of my satellites did something wrong, it'd be good to find that out.Does that sound as if Trump were pressuring Comey to stop his investigation?Remember, too, that the entire Trump-campaign-was-colluding-with-Russia story could — and very likely will — turn out to be completely bogus. If so, then what ""justice"" could Trump have been obstructing?Nevertheless, there are reasons to be concerned about Mueller's investigation, which have more to do with Mueller than Trump. Yes, Trump can be, and has been, his own worst enemy in these matters, and he would be well advised to shut up, avoid Twitter and let the investigation run its course.However, since we first wrote about Mueller's appointment in May, we've learned that he might not be as straight a shooter as we thought.It turns out that Mueller and Comey have been close friends for almost 15 years, which means that Mueller could have a significant conflict of interest in this case.Will Otis, an adjunct professor at Georgetown University Law Center, writes in a USA Today Op-Ed that ""Mueller should … step away because he has a potential personal conflict of interest, having been a longtime friend of a crucial witness, Comey, and Comey's key ally at the most important moment of his career.""""There is,"" Otis goes on, ""no way Comey is anything but a central witness in this investigation — if not a subject. Even less is there a way Mueller can be expected to evaluate Comey's credibility with the fresh neutrality, arm's-length curiosity, and objective sharp eye his job demands.""Also, Mueller stacked his staff with lawyers who had donated more than $56,000 to Democrats. Two of them gave $2,700 each to Hillary Clinton last year. That is not disqualifying, but it does raise the question of whether they will be entirely fair in how they pursue this case.And there's the troubling fact of the leaks now coming out about the investigation itself. In a tweet, Gov. Mike Huckabee said ""Mueller needs to 1st find who's illegally leaking and prosecute them; if he doesn't, I fear worst-that coziness w/ Comey means witch hunt.""Beyond this, there is the inherent problem with special prosecutors — they can easily become a never-ending fishing expedition that will try to charge someone for something, anything, if only to justify the vast amount of time and money they've spent.The Post story, for example, says that ""investigators have also been looking for any evidence of possible financial crimes among Trump associates."" Why not look into whether anyone connected to Trump ever had unpaid parking tickets, too?The onus is on Mueller to keep the investigation tightly focused and thoroughly buttoned up, and to do his work quickly.If Trump or any of his advisors colluded with Russia, we need to know — as soon as possible. If there's nothing there, we need to know that, too — as soon as possible. The country doesn't need and can't afford to have this drag on interminably.RELATED:Democrats Trot Out Plan C In Their Never-Ending Trump Impeachment CrusadeDid Obama White House And Loretta Lynch Illegally Meddle In 2016 Election?Dems May Come To Regret Mueller Investigation Into Trump-Russia Ties

258,ADM,"Trump And Russia: If there's one thing Congress' Russia hearings have shown, it's that President Trump has driven the Democratic Party and far-left media to near insanity. How else can you explain their unhealthy fixation on all things Trump and nonstop efforts to end his presidency?No, we're not joking. Listening to the hearings on Wednesday and Thursday, when National Intelligence Director Dan Coats, National Security Director Adm. Michael Rogers, Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe, and former FBI Director James Comey testified, was a revelation.In their questioning, Democrats were plainly not interested in the truth. They merely hoped for something, anything, that would be damning or damaging to Trump. In particular, they hoped for evidence of ""obstruction of justice"" to impeach Trump.But they didn't get it. Under persistent questioning Wednesday, Coats, Rogers and McCabe all emphatically denied that Trump had brought improper pressure to bear on the Russia investigation. None.Again, on Thursday, Comey drove that point home, saying that he did not perceive anything that Trump said to him as an attempt to obstruct ""the broader investigation into Russia or possible links to his campaign.""So in the end, as the current saying goes, it was a big nothing-burger, with cheese. And instead of a grand inquisition, it turned into rather pathetic political theater.Is this how the Democrats hope to regain power?Meanwhile, the left-leaning, Trump-despising media had already established the journalistic narrative that Trump was likely guilty of ""obstruction of justice,"" or possibly of colluding with a foreign power during an election. Their impeachment hopes soared.As Comey's testimony neared, CNN launched near-nonstop coverage. Other media jumped in, wondering what nasty revelations the fired former FBI director might spill. The week started out promising: CNN reported on Tuesday that Comey would ""refute Trump's assertion that Trump was told he was not under investigation."" So did ABC.Unfortunately, Comey made it clear that he told Trump he was not under investigation, multiple times. CNN and ABC were forced to retract their phony reports.They weren't the only media with egg on their faces. Citing four ""current and former"" intelligence officials, the New York Times reported earlier this year that key Trump campaign officials ""had repeated contacts with senior Russian intelligence officials in the year before the election.""It was a blockbuster revelation, one that potentially could have ended Trump's presidency.Care to comment, Mr. Comey? ""In the main, it was not true,"" he said Thursday.The media focused for weeks on these lines of inquiry. Yet, as Sen. Marco Rubio noted Thursday, the only thing from the entire investigation that didn't get leaked by Comey and others to the media was the essential fact that Donald Trump himself was not under investigation at all by the FBI.Even so, don't expect this to end soon. The Democrats now stand on the prow of their party like a mad, enraged Captain Ahab, scanning the horizon for the sign of their hated White Whale – Donald Trump.Just like the fabled captain of literature, they have endangered their whole party in their quest to get Trump. As they do, very quietly, Trump is going about undoing eight years of bad governance by President Obama.Over the past couple of weeks, as the media and congressional Democrats have focused on Comey and the Washington impeachment circus, Trump has been on a roll.He named 12 new well-regarded federal judges to the bench, rolled back one of the EPA's ""most expensive regulations ever,"" put an end to Obama's corrupt policy of using public money to enrich far-left activist groups, pulled the U.S. out of the laughably bad but absurdly costly Paris Climate Change Agreement, and continued a far-reaching reversal of regulations that the American Action Forum called a ""profound"" shift in policy that will have a major impact on the U.S. economy.And on Thursday, while Comey spoke and Democrats fumed, the House passed a bill that would undo some of the most pernicious elements of the Dodd-Frank law — another promise Trump made and is now on the verge of keeping.Not bad for two weeks' work.As for the Trump-haters in the Democratic Party and the media, the June IBD/TIPP Poll, taken from May 30 to June 6, holds some bad news: Some 47% of Americans agree that ""the investigation into possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia is a political 'witch hunt' aimed at getting the president impeached.""The nonstop efforts to get Trump are failing. Piece by piece, Trump's putting his agenda in place — just in time to watch the Democratic Party's ship go down.RELATED:IBD/TIPP Poll: Americans See Anti-Trump Media, 'Political Witch Hunt,' Pushing Russia InvestigationDemocrats May Come To Regret Mueller Investigation Into Trump-Russia TiesAre Democrats' Claims About Trump Colluding With The Russians Collapsing?Democrats Desperate To Turn Trump Into Nixon

261,ADM,"Accountability is about expectations, whether you're in business or the military. If you expect something from one of your people for a project, but he or she doesn't deliver on time, it's a problem.""I'll be disappointed, and it spreads negativity,"" Lee Ellis, a retired Air Force pilot who runs a leadership consulting and training firm, told IBD. ""In the military, lives depend on keeping promises and commitments.""Here's how to build that principle into your group's culture:Think team first. Ellis, founder and president of Atlanta-based Leadership Freedom, is advising a company that has an employee who is talented but isn't accountable for delivering projects on time. That causes disruptions to the whole team.""When people are not delivering, it throws a monkey wrench into everything and messes up the team,"" said Ellis, who wrote in ""Engage With Honor"" about building accountability.Spell it out. Be clear about what your firm values, what it expects from people and which behaviors it won't tolerate, says Joe Tye, CEO and head coach at Solon, Iowa-based leadership coaching firm Values Coach. Tye works with Midland Memorial Hospital in Midland, Texas. It specifies 12 core values that it then can hold people accountable to achieve.""That helps people do their jobs better,"" Tye said. ""But it also shows them how to be better people, and that helps them become a better employee.""Make your bed. Naval Adm. William McRaven told University of Texas graduates in his 2014 commencement speech that he learned in SEAL basic training the importance of making your bed right, first thing in the morning. The idea, McRaven said, was to accomplish the first task of the day. That gives a sense of pride and motivates people to polish off other tasks through the day. And it shows that the little things matter.""If you want to change the world, start off by making your bed,"" McRaven said in that speech.Ellis learned plenty of military lessons himself about the importance of accountability and doing the small stuff. The person who packed his parachute had to do it right every time.""If he didn't do his job, I'd be killed,"" Ellis said. ""In the military, the first thing you learn is there are no excuses.""Rely on rituals. Midland Memorial Hospital has a 14-minute ""huddle"" each morning for department leaders and any others who want to join. They recite a pledge to turn each complaint into a blessing and to avoid wasting time on blaming others and complaining.""Every day it's repeated throughout the hospital,"" Tye said. ""It's not just the words, it's the way people embrace them. If you can get people to take pride in their attitude and not being toxic, you wouldn't be seeing some of the negative things you're seeing today.""Do it right. The Veterans Health Administration held people accountable for limiting patient appointment wait times to 14 days. A scandal ensued because employees were falsifying records to make it look like they were meeting those goals. The VHA later said that the 14-day target gave employees incentive to act improperly. Instead, build accountability into the culture so peers push others to act appropriately, Tye says.Check the mirror. Make sure you're doing what you said you'd do, too.""You can't let yourself off the hook and make excuses,"" Ellis said. ""It's being brutally committed.""Dish out consequences. If one of your employees continuously drops the ball on projects and deadlines, meet with the person to figure out the problem, explain the effect on other team members and make it clear that's not acceptable. It might mean helping to set priorities. If the person's performance doesn't change, move him to a different role or get him out.""But you can't let it go,"" Ellis said.

263,ADM,"NATIONAL HARBOR, Md. — Boeing (BA) touted an upgraded F/A-18 Super Hornet's increased stealth and additional weapons payload Tuesday as it looks to remain a key component in the Navy's fleet until the 2040s.The push comes at a delicate time as the Pentagon reviews Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-35 program due to its growing costs and after President Trump said in February that he was ""looking seriously at a big order"" of  Super Hornets.Both companies point out certain advantages each aircraft has but hesitate to make head-to-head comparisons, especially given that the F-35 is considered a 5th generation fighter with stealth and advanced avionics while the Super Hornet is a 4th generation fighter without the same stealth capabilities.A proposed Block 3 version of the F/A-18 Super Hornet would be ""complementary"" to the F-35 with its long range infrared search and track system and a deeper magazine to hold more munitions than the Navy's F-35C variant, said Dan Gillian, Boeing's F/A-18 and EA-18 program manager, at the Navy League's annual Sea Air Space conference Tuesday.Boeing is also looking at improving the Super Hornet's stealth by applying a special radar-evading coating and removing the fuel tanks under the wings to reduce its profile.Meanwhile, the view from Lockheed is that the F-35 can help coordinate between platforms and share information, like incoming threats, while the Super Hornets could provide increased firepower, said Jack Crisler, the company's VP of F-35 business development and strategy integration.""It's the ability to take all the sensors integrated into the aircraft — we don't have pods or external antennas, that's all internal — take all the information and fuse it together and make the pilot a strategist as opposed to a technician or sensor operator,"" he told reporters.Boeing shares closed up 1.2% at 178.70 on the stock market today. Lockheed edged up 0.3% to finish at 269.56.Despite any jockeying for additional orders, one plane will not displace the other as they are expected to fly together. In the future, each Navy carrier is slated to hold two F-35 squadrons and two Super Hornet squadrons.At a House Armed Forces subcommittee hearing last week, Adm. DeWolfe Miller, the Navy's director of the Air Warfare Division, said that ""the carrier air wing of the future needs both 4th and 5th generation capability.""RELATED: Lockheed Not Bothered By Trump's Call With Boeing CEO, F-35 ChiefLockheed F-35s Doing 'Exceedingly Well' In South Korea As North Threatens

270,ADM,"ARLINGTON, Va. — The Navy could add strike and surveillance capabilities back to drones being developed for aircraft carriers, according to Lockheed Martin's (LMT) ""Skunk Works"" chief.Rob Weiss, the defense giant's executive vice president for Advanced Development Programs, said at Lockheed's media day Tuesday that the Navy will soon issue final requirements for the MQ-25A Stingray that are expected to entail new designs from the companies tapped to draw up plans.But while the emphasis for the drone will be on aerial refueling, other capabilities like intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance could follow.""There will probably be a follow-up capability — some ISR it could do and potentially some strike — but it's very much focused on tanking,"" Weiss told reporters.Lockheed, Boeing (BA), Northrop Grumman (NOC) and privately held General Atomics have separate contracts to produce competing developmental designs. The Navy plans to issue a formal request for proposals sometime this summer and award a contract in 2018.Shares of Lockheed shares closed up 0.2% on the stock market today. Boeing and Northrop rose 0.6%.The Navy had initially envisioned a drone that would take off from and land on aircraft carriers for deep-strike missions. Surveillance requirements were later added to the strike function.But last year, the Pentagon ordered the Navy to convert the program and instead develop a drone that can carry out unmanned aerial refueling.Weiss said Tuesday the tanker drone will provide more reach for Boeing F/A-18 Super Hornets and Lockheed F-35s that current tankers can't enable.But even though the Pentagon scaled back the drone's mission, Weiss said Chief of Naval Operations Adm. John Richardson has been clear that the MQ-25A was just the start.""This is a way to get started down that path of operating unmanned systems off carriers,"" Weiss said.

271,ADM,"President Trump's call with the Pentagon's F-35 chief and Boeing (BA) CEO Dennis Muilenburg last month could give Lockheed Martin (LMT) and other defense contractors grounds for protest in future competitions, an analyst said.After a House Armed Services subcommittee Thursday, Lt. Gen. Christopher Bogdan, the Defense Department's F-35 program manager, said it wasn't inappropriate that Muilenburg was on a call that then-President-elect Trump made to him on Jan. 17 about Lockheed's F-35.Bogdan said that the discussion centered around Boeing's Air Force One replacement, even though he doesn't work on that program, as well as a comparison of the Navy's F-35C variant vs. a new version of the F/A-18 Super Hornet that Boeing is proposing.""The things I talked about in front of Mr. Muilenburg were clearly publicly releasable information,"" Bogdan said. ""I understand the rules about talking about Lockheed Martin stuff in front of Mr. Muilenburg.""A Lockheed spokeswoman said the company had no comment about the phone call.But Andrew Hunter, director of the Defense-Industrial Initiatives Group at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said that even though Bogdan was careful with his words, Boeing could have learned some information that other potential competitors wouldn't have access to, giving it an advantage in future competitions.He added that while Lockheed currently doesn't have any grounds for legal action, if a future competition pitted its F-35C against an advanced Boeing F/A- Super Hornet, then Lockheed would have every right to ask to know what Boeing's CEO heard during that call and could give Lockheed grounds for a bid protest.Boeing shares rose 1.1% to close at 172.71 on the stock market today. Lockheed shares ended flat at 265.35. F-35 subcontractor Northrop Grumman (NOC) was also essentially unchanged at 243.58.Steven Schooner, a professor of government procurement law at George Washington University and former associate administrator for procurement law and legislation at the Office of Management and Budget, said that on the face of things the conversation ""doesn't appear to violate the Procurement Integrity Act"" because there isn't enough information showing that the call involved an actual active procurement.However, if any propriety Lockheed information, such as technology or pricing, was shared, then that would have been ""wildly inappropriate and potentially illegal,"" he added.Still, he couldn't imagine a situation where Lockheed would take legal action: ""Not much reason for Lockheed to poke the bear.""But legal issues aside, Schooner said Trump's phone call could have broken trust between the Pentagon and its industry partners.""Gen. Bogdan is (Lockheed's) partner in a massive enterprise of tremendous importance to the nation, the company and its shareholders,"" he told IBD in an interview. ""That's not the kind of behavior that instills trust and confidence in a business relationship.""Bloomberg first reported that Muilenburg was listening in on the call with Trump, who has attacked Lockheed's fighter program over its costs and suggested it would compete against Boeing's Super Hornet.Bogdan said Thursday that no decisions were made on the call, but the questions asked were the foundation of reviews that Defense Secretary James Mattis has since ordered on the F-35 and Boeing's Air Force One replacement.The F-35 review will look at ""opportunities to significantly reduce the cost"" as well as compare the F-35C to an upgraded Super Hornet.Last month, the Chief of Naval Operations Adm. John Richardson said the F-35 has capabilities that are ""on a completely different level"" than the Super Hornet but noted that the F-35 would be ""supplemented by a healthy cadre of advanced Super Hornets"" going forward.RELATED: Northrop: F-35 Talks With Lockheed Are On Course Since Trump TurbulenceLockheed: Acquisition Officials, Policy Shift More Critical Than Trump On Sales

John Richardson said Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-35 has capabilities that are ""on a completely different level"" than Boeing's (BA) F/A-18 Super Hornet, which President-elect Donald Trump has suggested may compete against the more advanced stealth jet.In a ""Defense One"" sponsored event Tuesday, Richardson said the Super Hornet, which is considered a 4th-generation fighter, could be upgraded to a 4.5-generation fighter and noted that the Navy's carrier air wing will consist of 5th- and 4th-generation fighters ""in the foreseeable future.""""We need the F-35s,"" he said. ""That is our 5th-gen capability which we need, supplemented by healthy cadre of advanced Super Hornets.""Addressing Trump's complaints about the F-35's costs and his vow to lower them, Richardson added, ""We need that capability, and we need to get it at the very best price for the taxpayer.""Shares of Lockheed were down 0.2% to 254.12 at the close on the stock market today. Northrop Grumman (NOC), a major subcontractor on the F-35, was off 0.7% to 228.48, and United Technologies (UTX), whose Pratt & Whitney unit makes the engines, slipped 0.2% to 109.97. Boeing dipped 0.7% to 157.67.Amid expectations for a bigger shipbuilding budget, Richardson said the Navy would prioritize resources on ships that are being built now, such as destroyers, attack submarines and amphibious warfare ships.""The industrial base is ready to respond"" to the call for more ships, Richardson said.Shares of shipbuilder General Dynamics (GD) lost 1.1% to close at 175.97 while rival Huntington Ingalls (HII) fell 1% to 189.61.RELATED: Lockheed Notes F-35 Jobs From Production Hike As Trump Blasts CostsAir Force Lays Out Big, Early Decisions For Trump's Administration

"
274,ADM,"President-elect Donald Trump is being faulted for supposedly appointing too many retired generals to Cabinet-level jobs and ""militarizing"" the government.Former Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn is slated to be national security advisor. Retired Marine Gen. James Mattis has been nominated as defense secretary. Retired Marine Gen. John Kelly is Trump's nominee for secretary of homeland security. High-ranking officers such as Gen. David Petraeus and Adm. Michael Rogers have been rumored for other positions in the Trump administration.All are retired as well as seasoned veterans. They have been previously entrusted with the lives of thousands of soldiers, and they have traveled around the world and met many of the key leaders in Asia, Europe and the Middle East.Most of the criticism of the Flynn, Mattis and Kelly nominations is politically created hysteria, like past contrived bouts of partisan frenzy over subjects such as the ""war on women"" or the ""climate of hate.""Why, after reaching a high military rank before retirement, should a nominee earn more scrutiny than an ex-banker, ex-politician or ex-lawyer?Did anyone complain when Barack Obama appointed five retired generals and one retired admiral to either Cabinet posts or high-ranking positions in his administration? In fact, Flynn and Petraeus were first appointed to high office by Obama.Under Obama, Petraeus became CIA director. Flynn served as Obama's director of the Defense Intelligence Agency. Retired Gen. Eric Shinseki was head of the Department of Veterans Affairs. Retired Gen. James Jones was national security advisor. Retired Adm. Dennis Blair and retired Gen. James Clapper served as successive directors of national intelligence.Ronald Reagan also appointed a number of retired and acting generals to Cabinet positions or other high offices, including Al Haig as secretary of state, Colin Powell (while on active duty) as national security advisor, and Vernon Walters as ambassador to the United Nations.Retired generals and admirals as administration secretaries, officers, directors and advisors are nothing new. In the 20th century, most of the stars of the American effort in World War II later served in the executive branch.President Harry Truman appointed Gen. George Marshall (of Marshall Plan fame) secretary of state and, later, secretary of defense. Gen. Omar Bradley was head of the Veterans Affairs while still on active duty.Dwight Eisenhower, without prior elected office, proved a most effective Republican president.The chief complaint about Trump's appointments is that too many generals will mean too great a likelihood of war. Historical evidence points to the opposite conclusion. Generals were not the proverbial ""best and brightest"" who argued for military intervention in Vietnam, the invasion of Iraq in 2003, or the bombing of Libya in 2011.In a famous example of a civilian-military paradox, President Bill Clinton's ambassador to the United Nations, Madeline Albright, scolded Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Colin Powell in 1993 for not being more eager to send troops into the Balkans. ""What's the point of having this superb military that you're always talking about if we can't use it?"" Albright asked Powell.Traditionally, retired generals and flag officers have no desire to see their own troops killed in what they see as optional wars abroad. Their occasional harangues about building up military power are predicated on notions of peace-through-strength deterrence: The more powerful the military is perceived abroad, the less likely it will be need to be used.Far more worrisome is the tired presidential custom of relying on ex-senators and politicians with law degrees to fill important executive positions despite their lack of outside-the-Beltway administrative experience.In 2008, Obama's resume consisted mainly of having been a Harvard Law School grad and, briefly, a U.S. senator. No wonder he looked to people with similar backgrounds for some key appointments — former senator and lawyer Joe Biden as vice president, former senator and lawyer Hillary Clinton as secretary of state, and later, former senator and lawyer John Kerry as secretary of state.Yet the current state of affairs, from the collapse of several Middle Eastern nations to the failed reset with Russia to the outrageous Iran deal, is not exactly evidence of success at the State Department. An Obama appointee with a similar background, former senator and lawyer Ken Salazar, was not an especially successful secretary of the interior.Lawyers, Ivy League graduates and former politicians usually dominate presidential appointments. How have these stereotypical profiles worked out?We are currently nearing $20 trillion in national debt, stagnating under nonexistent economic growth and near-zero interest rates, and suffering from record labor nonparticipation rates. We are seeing a failed health care system, a discredited IRS and VA, and the worst racial relations in half a century.Generals did not compile that record. Lawyers and lifetime Washington politicians did.
"
275,ADM,"Generating income in the current market environment has been a bit like a carnival game. It can take a lot of effort and the prize may seem of little more value than a cheap stuffed pink elephant with uneven button eyes.Interest rates on Treasury bonds remained near historic lows this year, forcing many income investors to chase yield in junk bonds and dividend-paying stocks.At this point choices for dividend stocks range from those down a lot and offering juicy yields, like energy refiner and marketer CVR Energy (CVI), which is 51% off its 52-week high and has a dividend yield of 10.8%, and transportation services company Scorpio Tankers (STNG), 53% below its high, yielding 12%. At the other end of the spectrum are stocks that have been on the upswing but have less potent yields, such as food giant Archer Daniels Midland (ADM), which is up 22% this year but pays a dividend yield of just 2.7%.Still, dividends could get more appealing. What if tax cuts under President Trump coax corporations to repatriate overseas caches of cash back to the U.S.? Many companies might use the bounty to boost their dividends.Special Report: Dividend And Income InvestingMany companies have already used those overseas cash stashes. Tony Hallada, CliftonLarsonAllen Wealth Advisors (CLA) managing partner, said, ""Corporations issued a massive amount of corporate bonds at record low interest rates that was collateralized by the assets held overseas. Many used the bond-sales proceeds to increase their dividends. This way they could pay out some of this buildup of capital on the balance sheet, borrow at record low rates and avoid paying the taxes on the repatriated money.""The game is changing already. Bond yields are rising as the economy strengthens and the Federal Reserve on Wednesday nears what is expected to be its first rate hike in a year. The 10-year Treasury yield has pushed as high as 2.4% in recent days, a level not seen since July 2015. Boatloads of erstwhile bond investors parked in dividend-paying equities are waiting to jump back into their preferred ""safe"" investment class.But investing in bonds when interest rates are rising can cause principal to erode since bond prices fall when rates rise. And when money moves back into bonds to capture higher yields, it could rush out of dividend-paying stocks that have been bid up to high valuations by income seekers.What's the smart play for retirees and others searching for income?Given today's risks in any one type of bond or income-oriented stock, the secret to winning the income prize is to be flexible. You need a variety of income sources, tilting toward those whose valuations hold steady while they churn out income, and tilting away from those whose prices sag and undercut your total return.You can get higher yield than what's paid by safe blue chip stocks by taking on credit risk. Ditto for bonds; you can get higher yield if you accept higher risk. But odds are you're aiming for a relatively safe balance of yield and risk.Telecom's Verizon (VZ), for instance, is approaching the end of the choppy year with a 9% gain and yielding 4.6%. Chipmaker Qualcomm (QCOM) is up 35% and yielding 3.1%.Don't expect the Federal Reserve to help your pursuit. Even with rate hikes, rates will remain near historic lows. And rate hikes can crush securities' prices.""The current environment is murky,"" said Radu Gabudean, a manager of several American Century funds, including $52.6 million Multi-Asset Income (AMJAX) and $16.4 million Global Allocation (AGAVX).Among stocks, sectors that tend to pay higher yield have grown pricey because investors have crowded into them. Among bonds, you have to give up more and more credit quality to find higher yield. Both of those facts threaten your ability to score price gains. You could even end up eating a loss.""Focusing your investments on those equity sectors and in lower-quality bonds is a dangerous investor behavior,"" said Justin Christofel, co-manager of $13.7 billion BlackRock Multi-Asset Income Fund (BAICX).Christofel exhibits flexibility by including covered call options among his fund's income sources. About 13% of its shareholders' money is invested in such options, which aim to minimize the high yield-high risk trap. But 20% to 30% of the fund's yield is from covered calls, he says.The fund's 12-month yield is 4.47% as of Nov. 30, according to Morningstar Inc. That's more than double the 2.08% yield from the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY), a proxy for the popular big-cap stock benchmark.Covered call options are a way to wrest income from stocks that pay few if any dividends.  Individual investors can follow this strategy on their own if they invest the time to shop for worthwhile stocks, arrange an option trading agreement with a brokerage and sell calls on specific stocks.""But it's far easier to have a financial advisor do it for you, or to use a mutual fund that holds them,"" Christofel said.IBD'S TAKE: You can learn more about investing in covered call options in this IBD report.The strategy involves buying a stock and at the same time selling to another investor that stock's potential price gain above a certain specific price. You pocket any gain up to that agreed upon threshold, known as the strike price. The person who bought the option gets any gain beyond that.This strategy generates income through the price — called the premium — the second investor pays for the option. Mutual funds pass those premiums through to shareholders as income in the form of dividends.This income strategy relies on potential share-price appreciation, not dividends paid. That means covered call options help a fund diversify its risks and avoid stocks with cyclically inflated share prices.""We can generate income this way without relying on sectors and geographies that investors are most likely to turn to for dividend income, such as staples, REITs, utilities and telecom,"" Christofel said.In turn, that frees his fund to focus on stocks with better prospects for price gains, improving the fund's overall total return potential.How can you tell if any given mutual fund holds covered call options? It's easier with some funds than others. In its monthly commentary, Christofel's portfolio details the share of income from each of its strategies. As of Oct. 31, the largest slice of its income pie was from covered call options, whose 30% share topped the second-largest source, global high yield bonds at 18%.The covered call option portion of his portfolio customarily yields 10% to 15% annually, he adds. Compare that to the 2.08% average 12-month yield of dividend-oriented stock mutual funds tracked by Morningstar Inc. as of Nov. 30.The strategy only works if the stock you use gains in price. Christofel sees the best opportunities for this tactic at the moment in financial stocks. Also promising are technology, consumer discretionary and industrials.Many additional strategies involve the familiar tit-for-tat, seeking some relatively safe balance of yield and credit risk or market risk. Among them:Linda Duessel, executive vice president and equity markets strategist for Federated Investors, likes stocks that raise their dividends. Payout is not their only benefit. The stocks tend to outperform other stock categories after Federal Reserve interest-rate hikes.""It's common with the first rate hike, and I call the hike that (may come out of) the Fed's next meeting (Dec. 13-14) a 'first hike' because the prior one was a year ago,"" Duessel said.Those stocks tend to climb because rate hikes occur amid economic strength, which helps companies lift their dividends.You can play this strategy through mutual funds or individual stocks. If you go with individual stocks, weigh how much a stock's price has risen in, say, the past year. The higher it has climbed, the harder it will be to score additional appreciation.""This is the category we're having the most discussions with clients about,"" said Terry Simpson, U.S. multiasset strategist for the BlackRock Investment Institute. ""This area offers higher yield with only a small increase in risk. A more stable U.S. dollar can create an opportunity for foreign-currency bonds.""But if the dollar rises in value, that could lure investors away from emerging markets debt, hurting their prices, Simpson cautions. ""An aggressive Fed tightening cycle or a global risk-off situation could threaten the asset class,"" he added.U.S. dollar-denominated emerging markets debt yielded 5.13% on average as of Nov. 30, according to the Bloomberg Barclays Emerging Markets USD Aggregate Bond Index. Its local currency counterpart yielded 5.18%.Attractive yields are this category's driver. But beware of volatility. ""High-yield bonds have been the best-performing category this year, along with emerging markets debt,"" said Adam Kramer, a manager of $42.7 million Fidelity Advisor Multi-Asset Income Fund (FWATX). ""But the year before, high yield was the worst performing.""The category's total return is vulnerable to cycles in sectors where it is highly exposed, such as financials and energy.High-yield bonds averaged a yield of 6.57% as of Nov. 30.Joanna Bewick, manager of two Fidelity Investments income-oriented mutual funds, describes convertible bonds as bonds on steroids. They generate income like bonds, and they offer the price appreciation potential of stocks. Convertible bonds averaged a yield of 3.31% as of Nov. 30.These loans are typically made to large corporations. The loans' interest rates are adjustable, usually every 90 days. That protects the lender in a rising rate environment.Borrowers generally have sound fundamentals. Still, these loans are typically below investment grade. The loans are senior secured debt, which give lenders first claim on the borrower's assets if it defaults. You can play these instruments through loan participation or bank loan mutual funds.Current 12-month yield is more than double the S&P 500's. But total return historically lags the broad stock market over multiyear periods.Elsewhere in our special report on dividend and income investing, you can read reports that offer tips about a wide variety of income strategies:RELATED:Want Income?

279,ADM,"Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-35 wowed crowds at the Farnborough Airshow in the U.K. last month, streaking across the sky, hovering in midair and even flying backward. Weeks later, the Air Force declared its version of the F-35 combat ready. Despite ongoing concerns about its development, the stealth fighter continues to reach key milestones, and production will hit full speed in a few years.Meanwhile, Northrop Grumman (NOC), which is a major subcontractor on the F-35, has locked down the other key piece of the Pentagon's combat aircraft upgrade cycle, winning the B-21 contract last year to build replacements for Cold War-era Boeing (BA) B-52s.With the $400 billion F-35 and $80 billion B-21 contracts in hand, Lockheed and Northrop would appear to have established air superiority. But there are hundreds of billions of Pentagon aerospace dollars still up for grabs, and demand overseas for high-tech missiles is on the rise, meaning Lockheed, Northrop, Raytheon (RTN) and Boeing can make more money and boost their shares as the new weapons stay in service for decades.""The general view at the moment is that investors prefer the longer horizon of a defense portfolio,"" said Howard Rubel, Jefferies managing director in equity research. ""If you look at the viability of Northrop or Raytheon today, there is enough turmoil that defense will continue to grow at a faster rate than the overall economy.""And Lockheed's expected organic growth of 4% through 2018 tops the 2.8% pace for the overall defense sector, Goldman Sachs said Wednesday, citing the F-35 program's size. Growth at Northrop, Raytheon and Flir Systems (FLIR), however, could outpace Lockheed's, Goldman added.Lockheed shares fell 1.65% Friday and are up 12.6% so far this year. Northrop dipped 0.7% but has seen a 12% climb in 2016. Raytheon has run 13% higher, while Boeing has lost 8.5%.IBD'S TAKE: Lockheed shares have eased below buy range, Northrop is 5.5% below an entry point, while Raytheon is above buying territory. While Boeing has been a drag on the Aerospace/Defense group, the pure-play defense stocks have helped lift the industry group to No. 66 out of the 197 IBD tracks, and they also have been boosting their dividends.Boeing, however, is entering a transition period in its defense unit, which lost the B-21 bid with partner Lockheed. As production of its F-15 Eagle and F/A-18 Super Hornet eventually winds down, Boeing -- whose 100-year history includes icons like the B-17 Flying Fortress and the P-51 Mustang -- faces the prospect of no longer making fighters or bombers.In July, Boeing's top defense executive said that the aerospace giant would shift its focus from new fighter jets to maintenance services on existing aircraft, new helicopters, satellites, space programs, and selling more military versions of its passenger jets. But Boeing said that decision wasn't based on one contract loss.""No one competition is going to drive that. It's a matter of managing the investment portfolio that we have with the opportunity and campaigns that we want to go after and win,"" Steve Nordlund, Boeing's vice president for strategy for defense, space and security, said in an interview.Boeing, Lockheed, Northrop, Raytheon and other defense contractors are turning their sights to U.S. nuclear missile contracts that could be worth more than $90 billion.Late last month, the Air Force released requests for proposals for a Ground-Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD) intercontinental ballistic missile to replace Boeing's aging Minuteman system, and a Long-Range Standoff (LRSO) nuclear cruise missile to replace Boeing AGM-86B Air-Launched Cruise Missiles.The GBSD's estimated cost is $62 billion over 30 years (though an independent Pentagon cost assessment found that estimate is too low). The LRSO's cost has been estimated at $20 billion-$30 billion. Boeing, Raytheon, Northrop and Lockheed are expected to bid on the two contracts, and initial contracts are expected to be awarded next year.Boeing officials were bullish in a recent interview with IBD that they would win the award for the GBSD, based on past work in the field.""We are confident the Air Force can rely on us, given our proven commitment,"" said Rich Choppa, director of global sales and marketing at Boeing's defense unit. ""We are just as committed to developing a new system as we were back in 1958 when we developed the Minuteman system that stood the test of time.""Other potential prime contractors for the Minuteman upgrade include Lockheed and Northrop. Some 37 other contractors are bidding on subcontractor work.The issue of ""helicopter money"" isn't limited to central banks. But unlike the European Central Bank or the Bank of Japan, the Pentagon isn't contemplating a massive dump of cash from hovering helicopters. Instead, the Pentagon is preparing a massive dump of cash onto makers of helicopters.While less sexy than fighter jets and supersonic missiles, the U.S. military's fleet of helicopters is also due for an upgrade. The Army is looking to replace its Black Hawk helicopters as heavy use in Afghanistan and Iraq have worn them out faster than expected. Textron's (TXT) Bell division is competing against a Boeing-Sikorsky team.The Army is also looking at replacements for its Boeing AH-64 Apache and CH-47 Chinook as well as its Bell OH-58 Kiowa. Providing helicopters to take the places of all four aircraft will be worth an estimated $100 billion. The Pentagon is expected to seek official proposals in 2019, followed by a contract award in 2020.""We feel very strong about our military helicopter position in the market place and the capabilities we would provide customers,"" Boeing's Nordlund said.Lockheed has spent heavily in helicopters, acquiring Sikorsky from United Technologies (UTX) last year for $9 billion and is looking to recoup its investment.Lockheed, Boeing, Raytheon and Northrop are all competing for another major Pentagon contract: the Air Force's $8 billion-$10 billion T-X trainer jet, which will be used to train F-22 and F-35 pilots and has potential for massive overseas sales to international customers like the U.K., Italy and others who are buying the F-35.Raytheon is on an industry team that includes Finmeccanica and CAE. Lockheed has partnered with Korea Aerospace Industries. Boeing and Saab are bidding together, and Northrop is leading a coalition that includes BAE Systems and L-3 Communications (LLL). The competition is expected to be fierce, and a contract award is expected late next year.On Lockheed's Q2 conference call, CEO Marillyn Hewson called its upgraded T-50A, which completed its first test flight in South Korea in June, ""a very good offering. It's an excellent solution. It's low risk.""Boeing has kept its design under wraps, only releasing concept art of the nose of a jet, though more details are expected next month. Pictures of a Northrop prototype in Mojave, Calif., leaked out earlier this week and appeared to share some similarities with the Air Force's current trainer jet, the T-38, which is also made by Northrop.Boeing, Lockheed, Northrop and privately held General Atomics are the likely bidders for the Navy's aerial-refueling drone, the MQ-25A Stingray.The program has been scaled back from its original inception, which envisioned a drone that would perform strike and surveillance missions.The Navy is still working on the requirements for the tanker drone, but stealth won't be on that list, Vice Adm. Mike Shoemaker told reporters earlier this month. The service plans to issue a formal request for proposals in the second half of next year and award a contract in 2018.Derrick Maple, unmanned systems analyst at IHS Markit, estimates that development, production and support costs could reach $6 billion.As missiles become more advanced, foreign governments are increasingly looking to them to boost defenses amid deepening global tensions.Last year, Raytheon booked a $2 billion order from Saudi Arabia for its Patriot missile and air defense system. South Korea and Japan are also paying Raytheon to upgrade their Patriot systems as the missile threat from North Korea looms. And by year's end, the Polish government is expected to finalize a Patriot deal that is estimated at $5.5 billion amid rising friction with Russia.Raytheon is also working with Israel's Rafael Advanced Defense Systems on revamping the Iron Dome defense system for its bid for the U.S. Army's Indirect Fire Protection Capability Increment 2 as protection against missiles and drones, among other threats.Raytheon isn't alone in the missile-defense market. Lockheed's THAAD system will be stationed in South Korea by late 2017. Lockheed and partner MBDA, a European defense giant, are bidding on a $4.5 billion German missile-defense deal that could be wrapped up later this year.And while U.S. involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan has greatly diminished over the last decade, the war against ISIS is boosting demand for munitions. Berenberg analysts said earlier this year that they expect sales of Lockheed's Hellfire missiles and the Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missiles to climb 7%-8% this year on ""restocking activities in the U.S. and export demand.""Geopolitical strains should continue spurring more spending. In addition to the Islamic State in the Middle East, Beijing's territorial claims in the South China Sea, and Russia flexing its muscles in Eastern Europe, disputes with China in the East China Sea are leading Japan to develop a land-to-sea missile system of its own. Top U.S. defense contractors may get involved.""The thing with these top-tier contractors, they have a lot of capabilities they can apply to various product areas that they want to invest in,"" Jefferies analyst Rubel said.RELATED:Lockheed F-35 'On A Path Toward Failing To Deliver' Full CapabilityNavy To Modernize Boeing Super Hornets To Fly With Lockheed F-35Boeing May Extend F/A-18 Work On Kuwait, Navy OrdersAir Force Touts Combat-Ready F-35 As 'Deterrent To Adversaries'

280,ADM,"WASHINGTON, D.C. -- The Navy plans to ""continue to modernize"" Boeing's (BA) F/A-18 Super Hornets, said Vice Adm. Mike Shoemaker, the commander of Naval Air Forces, calling newer versions ""4.5-generation"" fighters.During a talk Thursday at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, Shoemaker said he isn't minimizing the need for Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-35, a fifth-generation fighter. Instead, he sees a role for both of them.""We absolutely need the F-35 as soon as we can get it,"" he said. "" We want to pair those two up together.""Shoemaker said the two jets could be flown in tandem to take advantage of the planes' ""very good complement of high-low mix.""Boeing shares rose 0.2% to 135 in the stock market today. Lockheed shares fell 0.1% to 255.42. Northrop Grumman (NOC), a major F-35 contractor, was down 0.2% to 218.14IBD'S TAKE:  Boeing's stock isn't as strong as other defense players as its commercial sales struggle. Compare Boeing to others in the Aerospace/Defense group on Stock Checkup.  It's unclear how many more Super Hornets the Pentagon will buy. Without additional orders, Boeing faces the end of its production run. Currently, the Navy has money in its budget for two Super Hornets in 2017 and 14 in 2018.But the service could purchase even more Super Hornets as part of its unfunded spending request, and Congress seems keen to keep the production line open. Boeing has said it needs 24 orders per year to keep the production line alive past 2020.A deal between Boeing and Kuwait for 28 Super Hornets, with an option for 12 more, is facing political roadblocks, so Kuwait recently ordered Eurofighter Typhoons instead.Meanwhile, Shoemaker said that, despite some setbacks with the F-35's development, the Navy has plans to declare the new fighter ready for combat in late 2018. The Navy still needs the new 3F software update on the plane, however.The Air Force declared initial operational capability for its version of the F-35 earlier this month, and the Marine Corps declared its version combat-ready last year.RELATED: Nuclear Missile Cost May Strain Air Force As F-35, B-21 Ramp UpBoeing May Extend F/A-18 Work On Kuwait, Navy OrdersAir Force Touts Combat-Ready F-35 As 'Deterrent To Adversaries'.

283,ADM,"Lockheed Martin's (LMT) second-quarter revenue is seen rising as F-35 production ramps up, while prospects for foreign sales may get a boost from the stealth fighter's successful demonstration at the Farnborough Airshow.Analysts expect the defense giant's EPS to dip 0.3% to $2.93, but see revenue climbing 8% to $12.56 billion, when it announces Q2 results Tuesday.Lockheed plans to deliver 43 F-35s this year but is expanding operations at its Fort Worth, Texas, plant so it can produce 200 jets per year by the end of 2019. The F-35 and other planes are vital to Lockheed as its aeronautics division, the largest single unit, accounts for roughly 34% of the company's total sales.Earlier this month, Lockheed said it was near an agreement with the Pentagon on a contract covering additional production batches for 160 more F-35s.IBD'S TAKE: Defense stocks have been in buy range recently and showing strength amid recent market volatility.The F-35's fortunes will also factor into other defense contractors' results. United Technologies (UTX) whose Pratt & Whitney division got a $1.5 billion contract in April for 99 more F-35 engines, reports July 26. Northrop Grumman (NOC), another major subcontractor on the F-35, reports July 27.Meanwhile, the F-35's cost is also coming down. Lockheed CEO Marillyn Hewson told CNBC last week that the price is now 57% lower vs. the first aircraft delivered to the Air Force in 2011 and will be fall to $85 million per plane in 2019 from $100 million now. The Pentagon has also said it will extend by two years an F-35 cost-cutting program that so far has trimmed the price tag by $1 million per plane.Reducing the cost could help ease sticker shock on Capitol Hill and increase its appeal overseas. The F-35 finally made its major international debut flying at Farnborough last week, with impressive displays of its short-takeoff, vertical-landing and hovering capabilities seen providing political cover to governments that want to buy the over-budget and behind-schedule fighter.Lockheed has been pushing to expand its foreign sales to account for 25%-30% of total sales in coming years. But the U.S. is on track to approve $40 billion in foreign military sales in fiscal 2016, down from $46.6 billion in fiscal 2015, Navy Vice Adm. Joe Rixey told Reuters at Farnborough.Still, demand from Asia is growing, and orders from the Middle East should help coming in despite an oil prices pressuring government coffers there.Earlier this month, the Pentagon announced that Lockheed's Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system will be stationed in South Korea by late 2017. And Japan is considering Lockheed and Boeing (BA) for a fighter jet order worth up to $40 billion.Saudi Arabia's Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman met with Lockheed and other defense executives last month during his trip to Washington, as the kingdom buys missile-defense systems and bombs amid conflicts in Yemen and Syria.

285,ADM,"According to a New York Post article (May 22, 2016), in just two years, Hillary Clinton -- former first lady, senator from New York and secretary of state -- collected over $21 million in speaking fees. These fees were paid by Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank, Fidelity Investments, UBS, Bank of America and several hedge fund companies.In 2015, lobbyists spent $3.22 billion lobbying Congress. In 2013 and 2014, just 10 chemical companies and allied organizations spent more than $154 million lobbying the federal government. The Center for Responsive Politics in 2013 reported that the Dow Chemical Co. ""posted record lobbying expenditures"" in 2012, ""spending nearly $12 million,"" and was ""on pace to eclipse"" that amount. Fourteen labor unions were among the top 25 political campaign contributors between 1989 and 2014.Many Americans lament the fact that so much money goes to Washington. Let's ask ourselves why corporations, labor unions and other groups spend billions upon billions of dollars on political campaigns, pay hundreds of thousands of dollars for a speech and wine and dine politicians and their staffs.Do you think that these are just civic-minded Americans who want to encourage elected officials to live up to their oath of office to uphold and defend the U.S. Constitution? Do you think that people who spend billions of dollars on politicians just love participating in the political process?If you believe that either one of those notions applies, you're probably a candidate for a straitjacket and padded cell.A much better explanation for the billions of dollars spent on Washington politicians lies in the awesome growth of government power over business, property, employment and most other areas of our lives.Having such life-and-death power, Washington politicians are in the position to grant favors. The greater their power to grant favors, the greater the value of being able to influence Congress. The generic favor sought is to get Congress, under one ruse or another, to grant a privilege or right to one group of Americans that will be denied to another group of Americans. In other words, billions of dollars are spent to get Congress to do things that would be reprehensible and criminal if done privately.Let's look at one tiny representative example among the tens of thousands.The Fanjuls are among the biggest sugar cane growers in the U.S. Both they and Archer Daniels Midland benefit immensely from reducing the amount of sugar imported to our shores from the Caribbean and elsewhere. As a result of the reduction, they can charge Americans higher prices for sugar, and because of these higher prices, ADM can sell more of its corn syrup sweetener.If they used guns and goons to stop foreign sugar from entering the U.S., they'd wind up in jail. However, if they find ways to persuade congressmen to impose tariffs and quotas on foreign sugar, they get the same result without risking imprisonment. In 2014, the combined lobbying expenditures of the Fanjuls and ADM totaled $2.8 million, and they spent $754,002 in political contributions.The two most powerful committees of Congress are the House Ways and Means and the Senate Finance committees. Congressmen fight to be on these committees, which are in charge of tax laws. As a result, committee members are besieged with campaign contributions. Why? A tweak here and a tweak there in the tax code can mean millions of dollars to individuals and corporations.You might ask: What can be done? Campaign finance and lobbying reforms will only change the method of influence-peddling. If Americans would demand that Congress do only what's specifically enumerated in our Constitution, influence-peddling would be much smaller. That's because our Constitution contains no authority for Congress to grant favors or special privileges or give one American the earnings of another American.Seeing as most Americans do not want a constitutionally bound Congress, I am all too afraid that an observation attributed to Benjamin Franklin is correct: ""When the people find that they can vote themselves money, that will herald the end of the republic.""

287,ADM,"World War III: China is moving toward deploying the longest-range multi-warhead missile in the world. That and President Obama's dedication to total U.S. nuclear disarmament is a recipe for the future blackmail of America.On Tuesday, U.S. military satellites observed that Communist China, for apparently the seventh time, flight-tested its Dongfeng-41, a mobile intercontinental ballistic missile of globally unprecedented destructive power and range, which can transport 10 nuclear warheads to target cities over 7,000 miles from its launch site. The commander of U.S. Strategic Command, Adm. Cecil Haney, warned in January that “China is re-engineering its long-range ballistic missiles to carry multiple nuclear warheads.""Multiple independently-targetable re-entry vehicles, or MIRVs, unquestionably enhance the ability to launch a nuclear first strike. Being able to incinerate multiple targets within your enemy's homeland can back up an ultimatum that you make against that enemy, as opposed to nuclear missiles used as a deterrent, or as a defensive reaction to a nuclear attack.The DF-41 can reach all of the United States. And a congressional investigation found that Beijing is developing maneuvering re-entry vehicles, or MARVs, which confound and penetrate missile defenses. A new submarine-launched Chinese nuclear missile may also soon be fitted with multiple warheads.Richard Fisher, longtime Asian analyst and senior fellow with the International Assessment and Strategy Center, told the Washington Free Beacon's Bill Gertz this week that the U.S. must swiftly add at least 1,000 nuclear warheads to our arsenal. “In addition, the U.S. must quickly reintroduce tactical nuclear forces back to the Navy and Army to enable more assured deterrence of North Korea and Iran,” Fisher said.But while China is so obviously building nuclear superiority, President Obama continues the nuclear disarmament of the U.S., or, as his National Security Strategy last year put it, seeking ""the peace and security of a world without nuclear weapons ... reducing the role and number of nuclear weapons through New START,"" the 2010 disarmament treaty with Russia, ""and our own strategy.""Obama's 2013 Nuclear Posture Review Implementation Study outlines reducing U.S. strategic nuclear weapons by as much as a third. Heritage Foundation national security senior fellow Baker Spring notes that it ""states that the U.S. may do this unilaterally"" and ""provides evidence that President Barack Obama first chose the reduced numbers in the U.S. strategic nuclear arsenal and then used the NPRIS to justify these numbers, instead of assessing U.S. requirements for deterrence first and then choosing the numbers of nuclear weapons that would meet the requirements."" In 2012 in Seoul, Obama insisted the U.S. has ""more nuclear weapons than we need.”Obama's nuclear ""global zero,"" as former Republican Arizona Sen. Jon Kyl once called it, is a dream that our Chinese competitors certainly do not share. Nor does Moscow. To the contrary, both states seem eager to take full advantage of President Obama's global zero-inspired nuclear disarmament.As the threat of Islamist nuclear terrorism from Iran or the Islamic States grows, we cannot forget that while the Cold War is over, our Cold War adversaries are still thinking about nuclear superiority -- as we disarm.

288,ADM,"As Republicans head toward what could be a stalemated convention, they might recall how the party healed itself in 1952 in what was known as the ""winter of discontent."" The GOP drafted a military leader, Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower, as their presidential candidate.The looming showdown between Donald Trump and Ted Cruz is a potential ""train wreck,"" to quote my colleague Charles Krauthammer. Neither front-runner seems likely to have the 1,237 delegates needed for a first-ballot victory. An eventual win by either Trump or Cruz could leave a residue of bitterness that could undermine the party's chances in November.How can the GOP escape this demolition derby? Some have proposed a unity bid by House Speaker Paul Ryan, or the redux of Mitt Romney. But Ryan issued a statement Tuesday disavowing any interest -- evidently concluding that if he appeared to be stealing the nomination from the two candidates who won most of the primaries and caucuses, the result might be even more divisive for the GOP.Enter the candidates on horseback: It may sound like a crazy idea, but this country is hungry for the leadership the U.S. military, at its best, embodies.Who should be on the roster of potential national-security draftees? Gen. James Mattis, a retired Marine who served as U.S. Central Command commander, has already been floated. The Daily Beast posted an item Saturday reporting that wealthy Republicans were urging him to consider a late candidacy.Mattis is a blunt, plainspoken man who could rival Trump for impolitic comments. Four-star officers sometimes describe him as the ""warrior monk"" because of his intense, ascetic manner. But he's a true leader, beloved by his troops, and an intellectual who keeps a volume of meditations by the Roman philosopher Marcus Aurelius, in Latin, by his bedside.The GOP should consider some other names if it's looking for a former military leader who could unite a divided party and nation. A roll call, in alphabetical order:I tried to contact Mattis, McChrystal, Mullen, Petraeus and Rogers on Monday. But all of them either couldn't be reached or declined comment. One virtue or liability of these names, depending on your perspective, is that except for Rogers, I'm not sure of their party affiliation.The GOP may continue on its fun house ride with Trump and Cruz, but it is increasingly likely that this journey won't have a happy ending. Maybe it is time for Republicans to consider a nominee who might actually be able to lead the country out of the wilderness.

290,ADM,"Pacific Theater: Communist China is completing infrastructure in the South China Sea with which it can project military aggression. The Obama U.S. power vacuum brings ""change"" to yet another region of the globe.You’ve got to wonder if President Obama's own national security personnel are crying out for help for America.His Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper, in a Feb. 23 letter to Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain, R-Ariz., made public last week, said, ""Based on the extent of land reclamation and construction activity"" in the Spratly Islands, ""we assess that China has established the necessary infrastructure to project military capabilities in the South China Sea beyond that which is required for point defense of its outposts. These capabilities could include the deployment of modern fighter aircraft, surface-to-air missiles (SAMs) and coastal defense cruise missiles, as well as increased presence of People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) surface combatants and China Coast Guard (CCG) large patrol ships.""This extensive military expansion is being made possible by China's recent construction of more than a half-dozen artificial islands in the area: thousands of acres of new land for military activity. Beijing deployed various military vessels at its island outposts and ""has installed military radars, most likely air-surveillance/early warning radars.""China also ""has constructed facilities to support the deployment of high-end military capabilities, including modern fighter aircraft"" on the islands.  Clapper believes ""China will continue to pursue construction and infrastructure development at its expanded outposts in the South China Sea,"" which will allow it to ""be able to deploy a range of offensive and defensive military capabilities"" so that ""by the end of 2016 or early 2017, China will have significant capacity to quickly project substantial offensive military power to the region.""As the New York Times reported last week, ""American officials are increasingly worried that the buildup, if unchecked, will give China de facto control of an expanse of sea the size of Mexico and military superiority over neighbors with competing claims to the waters.""Meanwhile, “analysts say the buildup will make it more difficult for the United States Navy to quickly defend allies with weaker militaries, like the Philippines,” said the Times. “The deployment of fighter jets, antiship missiles and more powerful radar in particular could embolden the Chinese Navy while giving American commanders pause, they said.”U.S. Pacific Command chief Adm. Harry Harris last month told McCain’s panel that China was “changing the operational landscape in the South China Sea.”We don’t have to guess at the intentions of the country that for more than four decades has boasted the world’s largest armed forces. A Beijing white paper on the purpose of China's long-term military strategy last May said, ""Building a strong national defense and powerful armed forces is a strategic task of China’s modernization drive and a security guarantee for China’s peaceful development. Subordinate to and serving the national strategic goal, China’s military strategy is an overarching guidance for blueprinting and directing the building and employment of the country's armed forces.""The ultimate aim: ""Realizing the Chinese dream of achieving the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.""What does ""the Chinese dream"" mean for the nationalist Chinese in Taiwan, which enjoys Western-style free representative government and economic freedom? The Beijing document says, ""reunification is an inevitable trend in the course of national rejuvenation."" ""Reunification"" most certainly does not refer to Beijing ditching its authoritarian model for Taiwan’s system, which gives power to the people.China is taking avail of an opportunity: the flabbiness of the world’s lone superpower under Obama. It can see that if we can’t finish wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, we certainly aren’t going to do much against aggression from Asia’s nuclear-armed giant.

291,ADM,"This week marked an important anniversary: The current bull market is now seven years old. That's many, many moons of watching stock indexes march higher and pocketing sizable returns on your hard-earned investments.Caution returned to the market in 2015, as the S&P 500 started to trade sideways. Stocks are taking a bit of a breather this year too. Perhaps you're in need of one too.So take a moment to catch up on ETF winners of the current bull market. As the table below shows, they span a host of asset classes, from financials and preferred stocks to retail and midcaps.The very top performer out of 1,646 nonleveraged ETFs is -- are you ready for this? -- Guggenheim S&P 500 Pure Value (RPV), an ETF that targets the cheapest third of the S&P 500 index.A bull market brings to mind higher beta positions, with a stronger growth skew. Yet in the past seven years, the market has rewarded value-oriented characteristics slightly more so than growth, said Guggenheim managing director William Belden. That's helped RPV outperform.Value ETFs are generally considered to perform well over longer periods of time. ""Their greatest appeal is when the markets have gone both ways,"" Belden said.A closer look at RPV may be timely, as the market seems to have arrived at an inflection point for value stocks.RPV produced an average annual 30% return from March 10, 2009, to March 9, 2016. By comparison, SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) gained an annualized 19% over the same period.SPY was also outpaced by Guggenheim S&P 500 Equal Weight (RSP), with an annual average return of 22.4%.For investors seeking to make a style-focused bet on the markets, six Guggenheim ETFs offer style purity. They invest in only those stocks in the S&P 500, S&P MidCap 400 and S&P SmallCap 600 with the strongest value and growth characteristics.Traditional cap-weighted growth or value indexes generally have some overlap between growth and value stocks.Guggenheim's ""Pure Style ETFs"" avoid the muddle in the middle, as Belden likes to say. They also weight stocks by the strength of their growth or value characteristics.With $693.9 million in assets, RPV holds a mere 111 stocks from the S&P 500. They're selected based on metrics such as price-to-book, price-to-sales and price-to-earnings ratios.Top holdings now include electricity supplier NRG Energy (NRG), tech business HP Inc. (HPQ) and seeds processor Archer Daniels Midland (ADM).Morningstar analyst Alex Bryan cautions that this is a risky ETF investing strategy.""The S&P 500 Pure Value Index was about 47% more volatile than the market-cap-weighted S&P 500 Value Index, which tracks the cheaper half of the S&P 500, during the past decade,"" he wrote in October 2015. ""It has also tended to underperform during market downturns.""Belden points out RPV has rewarded investors willing to take on a little higher volatility.""It has a good risk-adjusted profile,"" he said. The expense ratio is 0.35%.Most investors tend to combine RPV with an S&P 500 ETF such as SPY to overweight value stocks. But RPV can also be combined with its sibling Guggenheim S&P 500 Pure Growth (RPG) for broad and well-diversified exposure to large-cap stocks.Growth investing and value investing are generally seen as being in favor in alternating periods. But the ""Pure Growth"" and ""Pure Value"" strategies have the potential to outperform at the same time, according to Guggenheim.""The combination of both might be an attractive core position as opposed to one that's more tactically oriented,"" Belden said.It's worth noting that all six Guggenheim's ""Pure Style"" ETFs ranked in the 100 top-performing nonleveraged ETFs in this current bull market.Image at top provided by Shutterstock.

292,ADM,"Defense Secretary Ash Carter is trying to enlist Silicon Valley in its cyberwar, even as tech giants like Microsoft (MSFT), Facebook (FB) and Alphabet (GOOGL) rally to Apple's (AAPL) defense in its fight against the FBI.Carter will speak at the RSA Conference, an information security-related conference in San Francisco, Wednesday about innovation in cybersecurity and opportunities for the Defense Department and Silicon Valley to work together. NSA Director and Cyber Command chief Adm. Mike Rogers is also speaking at the conference.The conference comes as the FBI and Apple are turning to Congress to settle a dispute over ""back doors"" that would allow officials, and potentially hackers, to decrypt customer data.Apple opposes a court order that would force it to hack into an iPhone used by a shooter in the San Bernardino, Calif., terror attack, citing the 1st Amendment. Facebook, Microsoft and Alphabet have said they will file amicus briefs supporting Apple.Shares of Apple closed up 4% Tuesday as its general counsel testifies before the House Judiciary Committee, along with FBI Director James Comey. Microsoft rose 3.3%, Facebook added 2.7%, and Alphabet climbed 3.5%.Cyberwarfare has become a focus in the fight against the Islamic State. At a Pentagon briefing Monday, Carter said forces were employing cyber warfare against ISIS, alongside traditional forces but didn't go into specifics.""At the same time, we're bombing ISIL's banks as well as oil wells they've taken over or coerced others into operating on their behalf,"" Carter said. ""We're also using cyber tools to disrupt ISIL's ability to operate and communicate over the virtual battlefield.""Carter said the cyberattacks were aimed at interrupting the Islamic State's ""ability to command and control forces there, control the population and the economy.""Meanwhile, the Pentagon has requested $7 billion in 2017 and $35 billion over the next five years to build up cyber capabilities.Silicon Valley and government agencies, especially the DOD,  have been at odds for years. Tech companies are especially leery of the Pentagon after Edward Snowden’s leaks over digital surveillance.But Carter has been a strong advocate for cooperation between the Pentagon and Silicon Valley and last year he became the first sitting Pentagon chief in nearly two decades to visit the tech hub. The Pentagon also opened a Defense Innovation Unit- Experimental outreach office in Mountain View, Calif.  last summer.Also appearing at the RSA Conference are executives from Symantec (SYMC), AT&T (T), Palo Alto Networks (PANW), Microsoft, Cisco (CSCO), VMware (VMW) and Red Hat (RHT).Palo Alto shares rose 2.7%. Cisco shares gained 2.5%. VMware edged up 0.5% and Red Hat shares 4.65%.
"
293,ADM,"Bud Zumwalt earned a Bronze Star for valor in World War II, was an officer on a battleship during the Korean War and commanded America’s Navy in the Vietnam War.It all prepared him to challenge the Pentagon bureaucracy when he was made the youngest chief of naval operations in history at 49, promoted over 33 more senior officers.In 1970, the Navy was drifting toward the shoals with a demoralized crew, deteriorating quality of life and outdated policies.Zumwalt confronted those who benefited from the status quo, which included discrimination against minorities and women.“His sailors called him Zorro because he never stopped fighting for them and didn’t care that it might derail his career,” Larry Berman, author of “Zumwalt,” told IBD. “He was a trailblazer with the courage of a lion, who used his power to combat injustices and face down adversaries who were on the wrong side of history.”As he towed his beloved Navy toward the 21st century, Time magazine called him its “most popular leader since World War II.”Zumwalt (1920-2000) was born in San Francisco to physician parents who expected him to follow in their footsteps.The family moved to Tulare in central California, and he was a high achiever, but his parents were concerned about his growing obsession with girls after he tried to elope with a classmate.They decided that he needed discipline before he went to medical school and nudged their congressman to appoint him to attend the Naval Academy at Annapolis, Md.He entered in June 1939, three months before the German invasion of Poland. The rising demand for officers to prepare in case America went to war resulted in the program being reduced from four years to three, and he graduated with soaring honors in June 1942.At the same time, he married Jane Carey, but they didn’t know each other well and would divorce in less than two years.With America now in the thick of World War II, Zumwalt experienced his first combat in June 1943 on the destroyer Phelps as officer of the deck, the skipper’s right hand, during bombardment of Japanese positions on the Aleutian Islands of Alaska.Promoted to lieutenant junior grade and transferred to the destroyer Robinson, he was in charge of its combat information center. It held a radar screen that showed ship positions in half a dozen clashes with the Japanese navy from Saipan to Guam.Especially crucial was the Battle of Surigao Strait in October 1944, part of the Battle of Leyte Gulf in the Philippines, the largest naval action in history.The Robinson was one of the rare destroyers that survived close-up torpedo attacks. Zumwalt’s urgent warning kept it from crashing and sinking in the smoke of battle.His heroism earned him a Bronze Star. His radio man later wrote, “(Zumwalt’s) quiet strength and obvious calm, whether during a torpedo run, kamikaze attacks or retaliatory fire from hostile shore batteries, never failed to reassure me.”After the war ended in the summer of 1945, the Robinson accompanied minesweepers up the Yangtze River of China to accept the surrender of Japanese vessels.Along the way, Zumwalt asked a Russian, Mouza Coutelais-du-Roche, to help him improve his Russian skills in exchange for helping her English. They married in October and would have four children, with the family moving over 40 times during his career.After serving as an executive officer on two peacetime ships, he spent 1948-50 teaching naval science to the University of North Carolina. There he became friends with Gen. George Marshall, the former Army chief of staff and secretary of state who predicted that the West’s disarmament would result in another war soon.Zumwalt was promoted to lieutenant commander in 1950 and took over the destroyer Tillis operating out of Charleston, S.C.A year later, he became navigator for the battleship Wisconsin as it provided combat support for Marines during the Korean War.On returning stateside in 1952, he attended the Naval War College in Newport, R.I., took ship commands and ran the Navy Bureau of Personnel in Washington, D.C.Now he was making decisions on who had shore and ship assignments. The Navy was losing thousands of men every year due to long deployments. He created a better balance, which caught the attention of the Navy brass.One who caught on was the head of the nuclear force, Adm. Hyman Rickover. He assigned this talent to command the guided missile frigate Dewey, in 1959. It was the beginning of two decades of head butting between them.“Rickover and Zumwalt were similar in many ways — brilliant, tireless, blunt, arrogant, farsighted and vain,” said Berman. “Rickover was almost an autonomous power, but Bud wasn’t intimidated.”In 1961 he was promoted to captain and entered the National War College in Washington.The next year, he graduated, and Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Paul Nitze chose Zumwalt to be his aide.They worked closely with President Kennedy during the Cuban Missile Crisis of October 1962 and in negotiating the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty with the Soviet Union, which was signed in August 1963.Two months later, Nitze was appointed secretary of the Navy, and Zumwalt went with him. They soon prepared a report showing why a land war in Vietnam would likely be a disaster, but Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara rejected their conclusion.In 1965, Zumwalt left the Pentagon for San Diego. With the rank of rear admiral, he ran a cruiser-destroyer flotilla.A year later, he took over the Navy's new systems analysis division, which analyzed the Navy's long-term needs. His calls influenced the next generation of leaders.In 1968, after landing the first of three Distinguished Service Medals, he became commander of all naval forces operating in Vietnamese waters and rose to vice admiral.Army Gen. Creighton Abrams, who oversaw all U.S. forces in Vietnam, considered Zumwalt the only leader who grasped the importance of expedited training of South Vietnamese to take over their defense.
"
294,ADM,"Zumwalt’s first task was to talk with top field commanders.The admiral dived in, risking his life by going out on patrols and listening to sailors on the front line. It helped him develop tactics to interdict enemy supply lines and mount winning offensives.One Vietnam swift boat commander was his son, Elmo III. Assured by the company making a herbicide nicknamed Agent Orange that it was safe, the admiral ordered it sprayed on the jungle for a thousand yards on both sides of rivers to eliminate hiding places for snipers.His son’s death in 1988 was blamed on the chemical. In retirement, Zumwalt did much to help others who suffered from it.In May 1970, President Nixon nominated Zumwalt to be chief of naval operations, with promotion to full admiral in July.Zumwalt now aimed to make sailors’ life more attractive. He announced changes via policy directives nicknamed Z-grams, 69 of them by the end of 1970. Among them:No. 13: Granted half of a ship’s crew 30 days’ leave soon after returning from overseas.No. 14: Axed 18 duties assigned to overloaded junior officers.No. 18: Opened a finance center 24/7 to process urgent inquiries about pay and benefits.No. 33: Improved customer relations at base exchanges.No. 38: Eliminated unnecessary work on Sundays and holidays.No. 46: Reduced paperwork for maintenance inspections.No. 49: Required half of personnel on awards boards to be below the rank of commander.His most important changes were to open up the ranks to more minorities and women.Meanwhile, he encountered resistance in replacing the large number of aging vessels with a new mix, balancing the purchase of expensive nuclear-powered ships with lots of far less costly ones.Zumwalt’s Perry-class guided missile frigates became the most popular group of warships since World War II until the 1990s. (The first of the high-tech Zumwalt-class of destroyers was sea-tested this past December).The admiral retired from active duty in July 1974 at age 53.He died at 79, with the chief of naval operations, Adm. Jay Johnson, recalling at his funeral “his visionary leadership and unswerving commitment to improving the lives of our sailors” and for having “profoundly changed and enhanced the character and culture of our Navy.”Father of the modernized Navy.Overcame: Bureaucratic, political stand vs. change.Lesson: Courage means having a thick skin.“I don’t give a damn where an idea comes from.

296,ADM,"Since President Obama’s Iran nuclear deal, it seems that every encounter between the world’s foremost terrorist state and the U.S. brings the world’s lone superpower down a peg.After firing rockets within a mile of the USS Harry S. Truman aircraft carrier in the Strait of Hormuz last month, Iran two weeks later posted video of 10 detained U.S. sailors kneeling and being held at gunpoint after their transport vessel was seized for straying into Iranian waters earlier this month.Now -- within a single month -- comes a third embarrassment for the U.S.  Iran claimed on Friday that it flew a military drone over one of our aircraft carriers and provided video that the drone purportedly took.The video is chilling because it shows our carrier in a viewfinder’s crosshairs -- at the center of a bullseye.Our Navy confirmed that a drone was seen “directly over” the Harry S. Truman in the Persian Gulf on Jan. 12 -- the same day the sailors were detained -- but said a Navy chopper flew near it beforehand and determined it to be unarmed.The commander of Iran’s navy, Adm. Habibollah Sayyari, boasted on Iranian state TV that the drone got “so close to the warship” that it could “shoot such beautiful and accurate footage of the combat units of the foreign forces.”  Iran was conducting naval exercises at the time.According to Tehran’s state news agency, an Iranian submarine on an intelligence-gathering mission also took “clear pictures of the aircraft carrier without catching the attention of the staff on board.”The U.S. Navy said the Iranian drone “posed no danger to the ship,” but its actions were “abnormal and unprofessional.”The statement downplays the significance of yet another humiliation of this country at the hands of Iran. Surveillance isn’t always accurate, as Americans have learned the hard way many times, and the Iranian drone could still have been a danger to the carrier’s crew.Even though the Iranian aircraft was unarmed, our forces still would have had every right to shoot it down. Then the message going out to the world would be that the United States does not tolerate enemy military vehicles flying over our ships in international waters.Instead the message our friends and foes get comes from that video Iran procured for itself: a mighty U.S. aircraft carrier, crowded with our aircraft, adorned with a target centered on its flight deck.Back during the Reagan administration, when a U.S. frigate was nearly sunk by an Iranian mine in 1988, we responded decisively by bombing two of Iran’s oil rigs and six of its ships, not caring that the mine was probably meant for Saddam Hussein’s Iraqi ships and not one of ours.Today, the Obama administration’s preferred weapons against Iran are words.  Because to this administration, a “peace” deal that keeps Tehran perilously close to nuclear weapons capability is apparently more worth protecting than our sailors’ lives.

297,ADM,"Shares of Archer Daniels Midland Company (ADM  -  Free Report) have reached a 52-week high of $46.41 on Jun 20, though it closed a tad lower at $46.17. Year to date, the stock has gained 16.9%, outperforming the industry’s 8% rise. This upside can be primarily attributed to the company’s robust growth strategies, including progress on its portfolio management initiatives, cost-savings plan and Readiness program.Moreover, Archer Daniels began 2018 on a solid note with first-quarter earnings and sales surpassing estimates and improving year over year. Notably, this marked the company’s return to growth trajectory, reversing its more than three-year long trend of missing sales estimates while earnings topped for the second straight quarter.Results benefited from increased revenues as well as higher operating profit and lower tax rate. Moving ahead, management expects to deliver solid results in 2018, courtesy of improved market conditions, gains from U.S. tax reform, product innovations and Project Readiness.Analysts are growing bullish on the stock as well. This is apparent from the upward revisions in its earnings estimates. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.09 for 2018 and $3.17 for 2019 increased 3.7% and 2.3%, respectively, in a month.Strategies Supporting Archer Daniels’ GrowthArcher Daniels’ strategic initiatives for business portfolio management are expected to help in realizing value and investing the same in best possible resources to enhance returns. In this regard, the acquisitions of glucose and starch maker, Chamtor, and purchase of 90% stake in BIOPOLIS (leading microbial technology provider) are worth mentioning.Notably, the Chamtor buyout helped Archer Daniels to expand its sweetener and starch capabilities in Western Europe. Simultaneously, it has also undertaken few divestitures to streamline portfolio. These acquisitions and divestitures are expected to enhance the company’s portfolio besides improving its knowledge and boosting results.Additionally, Archer Daniels remains focused on strengthening its business through increased cost savings — a key component of its long-term strategy. Management targets $550 million in additional run rate cost savings over the next five years, including cost savings of $350 million from operational excellence and process enhancements, and about $200 million in incremental purchasing savings.In the first quarter of 2018, the company generated operational cost savings of $70 million on a run rate basis and is on track to exceed the targeted $200 million savings for 2018. Going ahead, it is expected to focus on lower capital spending and generate benefits from the aforementioned investments.Archer Daniels has also been enhancing its operational efficiency at production and supply chain networks, in order to curtail costs. In sync with this, the company is on track with its business transformation, under its 1ADM program, which forms an integral part of Project Readiness. It expects Readiness to help management have a more coordinated approach toward driving business improvement, standardizing functions and enriching consumers’ experience.Further, Archer Daniels plans to allocate resources efficiently and make prudent business investments. In 2018, the company remains on track with further 1ADM rollouts to cover the entire enterprise.Management also realigned its business into four segments — Carbohydrate Solutions, Nutrition, Oilseeds and Origination — to accelerate growth and resonate well with changing customers’ needs. These new business segments are expected to clearly differentiate the company’s product and service offerings besides justifying its operating structure.Additionally, these segments will help Archer Daniels provide value-added and exclusive product assortments, thus boosting growth across its business portfolio. Moving ahead, Archer Daniels plans to remain focused on five major platforms, animal nutrition, bioactives, carbohydrates, human nutrition and taste along with geographic regions to drive growth.Bottom LineDespite these tailwinds, significant global presence exposes Archer Daniels to adverse currency translations. Also, intense competition in all its segments and volatile commodity prices remain threats.Nevertheless, we believe Archer Daniels’ focus to drive growth on its solid strategic actions might help this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company overcome such challenges.Want Solid Stocks in the Consumer Staples Sector, Check TheseMedifast, Inc.

298,ADM,"Trade disputes between the two biggest economies escalated after the United States and China engaged in a tariff war. In his pledge to punish the alleged theft of U.S. intellectual property, Trump finally unveiled the list of $50 billion worth of Chinese goods targeted for 25% tariff to be applied in two phases.The first round of tariff will apply to 818 imported Chinese goods worth $34 billion, including auto, electric cars, aerospace, communications tech, new materials and robotics and will go into effect on Jul 6. The second wave of 284 goods worth another $16 billion is under review and will go into effect after a public comment. This includes semiconductors, and a broad range of electronics and plastics related to China's Made in China 2025 strategic plan, aiming to dominate the emerging high-technology industries that will drive future economic growth for China (read: Trump, Tariff & Geopolitics Lead May: 10 Top ETF Stories).In retaliation, the second-largest country announced that it will slap a 25% tariff on 659 American goods for a similar amount. The list of goods was more than six-fold from an earlier version released in April. Penalties on 545 American goods worth $34 billion will be effective Jul 6 and targets agricultural products, autos and seafood. The 545 products include lobsters, soybeans, electric cars, orange juice, whiskey, salmon and cigars, according to the Ministry of Finance. Notably, most items are food and other farm goods hitting American farmers the most.The new tariffs will hit hard the American seafood industry. The United States imported more than $2.7 billion in Chinese seafood, and exported more than $1.3 billion to China last year. In particular, the Maine lobster industry will be hurt the most as it was worth more than $430 million at the docks last year. Chinese imports of American lobster have grown exponentially in recent years, rising to $142.4 million last year from $108.3 million in 2016. Then, Salmon is the biggest seafood item being exported to China and accounted for $318.5 million of the total seafood last year.The implementation date for the remaining 114 products will be announced later and will include chemical products, medical equipment and energy products.As Trump threatened to pursue an additional tariff if China retaliates, he is seeking for another tariff on $100 billion in Chinese goods, according to Reuters. The intensifying tariff talks could trigger a full-fledged trade war between the world's two largest economies and hit hard various corners of the economy. Below we have highlighted ETFs & stocks from those areas:Farm BeltAccording to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the United States exports about $14 billion worth of soybeans to China. The duties on American exports will hurt these shipments, leading to a negative impact on the top line of soybean exporters like Archer Daniels Midland Company (ADM  -  Free Report). DowDuPont’s DWDP agriculture unit is expected to be hurt by price declines in soybeans. ADM gained 1.7% on Friday while DWDP lost 0.9%.U.S. soybean November futures fell as much as 1.9% to a one-year low, pushing Teucrium Soybean ETF (SOYB  -  Free Report) down by 2.1% on Friday (read: China Tariffs Target US Farm Belt: Stocks and ETFs in Focus).Farming equipment maker Deere & Co. (DE  -  Free Report) could be among the biggest losers as the proposed China tariff on agricultural products would reduce demand for the related machines. Bunge Ltd. (BG  -  Free Report), an integrated global agribusiness and food company spanning the farm-to-consumer food chain, could also lose from the lower demand for farm products. Deere and Bunge fell 0.9% and 0.7%, respectively on tariff talks.AerospaceBoeing (BA  -  Free Report) would be hit hard from the proposed Chinese tariff, as it is the top U.S. exporter to China and will likely buy about $1 trillion worth of its aircraft over the next 20 years. Shares of BA shed 1.2% on the day. iShares US Aerospace & Defense ETF (ITA  -  Free Report), which offers exposure to the aerospace and defense sector of the U.S. equity market, dropped 0.4%.AutoGeneral Motors (GM  -  Free Report) would be the biggest loser as China has been the largest retail market for six consecutive years as the automaker sold four million vehicles in 2017 for the first time ever. The stocks added 0.8% following tariff talks. Meanwhile, Tesla TSLA) also seems to be the biggest loser as China has threatened more import tariff on electric cars. Tesla also rose 0.1% on the day. First Trust NASDAQ Global Auto ETF (CAR  -  Free Report)Z), which offers nearly one-fourth exposure to the American auto sector, dropped 1.1% (read: Trade War Tensions Flare Up: Must-Watch ETFs & Stocks).SemiconductorsTrump’s import tariff for Chinese products will compel American semiconductor companies to pay duties on their own products. This is because chips are manufactured in the United States but are shipped to the Asian nation for assembly, testing and packaging due to its favorable labor costs, according to the Semiconductor Industry Association. Some of these chip stocks include Intel (INTC  -  Free Report), Micron (MU  -  Free Report) and Texas Instruments (TXN  -  Free Report). INTC and MU were down 0.8% and 1.6%, respectively, while TXN gained 1% at the close on Friday. iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF (SOXX  -  Free Report) was also down 0.09% on the day.Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.

299,ADM,"While designing their portfolio, an investor may end up making a wrong choice. This can be due to a lack of expertise in identifying outperformers from a plethora of stocks on the market at any point of time.Choice of improper stocks can adversely impact investors’ returns, thereby ruining the very objective of investing their hard-earned money in the highly unpredictable stock market. In a bid to avoid such a scenario, investors, more often than not rely on guidance from proper channels.Broker Advice – The SaviorIn the field of investing, brokers are deemed to be experts, equipped with thorough knowledge. Brokers, irrespective of their types (sell-side, buy-side or independent), have at their disposal a lot more information on a company and its prospects than individual investors. They go through minute details of the publicly available financial documents apart from attending company conference calls and other presentations.  Broker opinion should thus act as a valuable guide for investors while deciding on their course of action (buy, sell or hold) on a particular stock.Be Guided by Earnings Estimate Revisions Since brokers indulge in meticulous research, the question of their actions being arbitrary/out of the blue does not arise. The direction of estimate revisions serves as an important pointer regarding the price of a stock. In fact, a rating upgrade normally leads to stock price appreciation and vice versa.Given the expertise of brokers in investment matters, it is natural for investors to believe that there is a solid reason/logic behind brokers improving their recommendation on a particular stock. In fact, a rating upgrade generally leads to stock price appreciation and vice versa. Estimates can move north for a number of reasons – favorable earnings performance, a bullish guidance, product launch or any favorable macro scenario.To take care of the earnings performance, we have designed a screen based on improving analyst recommendation and upward estimate revisions over the last four weeks.Revenues Performance – A Key PointerAccording to many market watchers, a revenue beat is more creditable for a company than a mere earnings outperformance, especially in an environment of revenue weakness due to macroeconomic headwinds like a strong dollar or lackluster demand for travel (which will hurt travel-focused companies). Therefore, one must take the top-line performance into consideration as well while formulating a winning strategy. We have included in our screen the price/sales ratio, which serves as a strong complementary valuation metric.Screening Criteria# (Up- Down Rating)/ Total (4 weeks) =Top #75: This gives the list of top 75 companies that have witnessed net upgrades over the last 4 weeks.% change in Q (1) est. (4 weeks) = Top #10: This gives the top 10 stocks that have witnessed earnings estimate revisions over the past 4 weeks for the upcoming quarter.To ensure that the strategy is a winning one, covering all bases, we have added the following screening parameters:Price-to-Sales = Bot%10: The lower the ratio the better, companies meeting this criteria are in bottom 10% of our universe of over 7,700 stocks with respect to this ratio.Price greater than 5: A stock trading below $5 will not likely create significant interest for most investors.Average Daily Volume greater than 100,000 shares over the last 20 trading days: Volume has to be significant to ensure that these are easily traded.Market value ($ mil) = Top #3000: This gives us stocks that are the top 3000 if one judges by market capitalization.Com/ADR/Canadian= Com: This eliminates the ADR and Canadian stocks.Here are five of the 10 stocks that made it through the screen:Delek US Holdings Inc. (DK  -  Free Report) has a diversified energy business focused on petroleum refining, marketing and supply of refined products, and retail marketing of fuel and general merchandise.

300,ADM,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Archer Daniels Midland Company (ADM  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 2.8% in that time frame.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is ADM due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Archer Daniels Beats on Q1 Earnings & Sales, Up Y/YArcher Daniels Midland Company began 2018 on a solid note with first-quarter results outpacing the estimates and increasing year over year. With this, the company breaks its more than three-year long trend of sales misses, besides second straight earnings beat.Q1 HighlightsThe company’s first-quarter adjusted earnings of 68 cents per share increased 13.3% year over year and substantially outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 47 cents.On a reported basis, Archer Daniels’ earnings were 70 cents per share compared with 59 cents in the prior-year quarter.Moreover, the company’s revenues of $15,526 million grew 3.6% year over year and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $14,523 million. The upside was driven by solid sales across all segments except the Origination segment.Going by segments, quarterly revenues at Oilseeds, Carbohydrate Solutions and Nutrition were up 7.8%, 4.5% and 11.1%, respectively, to $5,633 million, $2,622 million and $950 million. Also, revenues grew 12.8% to $106 million at the Other segment in the first quarter. However, revenues declined 1.4% to $6,215 million at the Origination segment.Operational DiscussionArcher Daniels reported adjusted segment operating profit of $717 million in first-quarter 2018, up 5.7% from the year-ago quarter. On a GAAP basis, the company’s segment operating profit rose 4.1% year over year to $704 million.On a segmental adjusted basis, adjusted operating profit for the Oilseeds segment climbed 11.8% year over year to $350 million. The uptick can be attributed to robust global market dynamics that lead to increased soybean crush margins. Notably, this segment witnessed crush volume records in North and South America. Further, sturdy origination volumes and higher margins were witnessed in South America. Additionally, robust results at Refining, Packaging, Biodiesel and Other operations aided segment’s growth. However, results were soft year over year at Crushing and Origination along with lower contributions from Wilmar.Carbohydrate Solutions segment’s adjusted operating profit inched up 0.9% to $213 million. Results benefited from enhanced results from joint ventures in North America as well as robust Starches and Sweeteners results. Moreover, Wheat Milling results rose year over year on higher margins. However, Bioproducts results were hurt by soft ethanol margins.Nutrition segment’s adjusted operating profit rose 24.7% to $96 million. The upside stemmed from double-digit profit growth at Wild Flavors and results at Animal Nutrition grew substantially on solid trade sales and favorable product mix. However, the improvement was somewhat compensated with soft results at Specialty Ingredients.However, adjusted operating profit for the Origination segment’s declined 4.3% to $45 million. During the quarter, gains from solid Merchandising and Handling results as well as sturdy Global Trade owing to higher volumes and margins were more than offset by weak U.S. export volumes and nearly $40 million of mark-to-market impact on existing contracts. Additionally, transportation results declined year over year, leading to higher operating expenses.FinancialsArcher Daniels ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $797 million, long-term debt including current maturities of $6,670 million and shareholders’ equity of $18,737 million.In the first quarter of 2018, Archer Daniels generated negative cash of $3,574 million from operating activities. Further, the company’s trailing four-quarter average adjusted ROIC came in at 6.4%.Additionally, the company paid dividends of $190 million to shareholders in the quarter.Looking AheadManagement remains impressed with its quarterly results, which gained from the company’s strategic initiatives and cost-saving efforts. Moving ahead, Archer Daniels remains focused on five major platforms, animal nutrition, bioactives, carbohydrates, human nutrition and taste along with geographic regions to drive growth.Archer Daniels remains optimistic to deliver solid results in 2018 on the back of improving market conditions, gains from U.S. tax reform, product innovations and Project Readiness.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates. There has been one revision higher for the current quarter compared to three lower.Archer Daniels Midland Company Price and Consensus Archer Daniels Midland Company Price and Consensus | Archer Daniels Midland Company QuoteVGM ScoresAt this time, ADM has a poor Growth Score of F, however its Momentum is doing a lot better with an A. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of B on the value side, putting it in the top 40% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Our style scores indicate that the stock is more suitable for momentum investors than value investors.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. Notably, ADM has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.

301,ADM,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (ADM  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Archer-Daniels-Midland has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 17.7, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 compares in at about 19.9. If we focus on the stock’s long-term PE trend, the current level puts Archer-Daniels-Midland’s current PE ratio marginally above its midpoint (which is 17.4) over the past five years.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the sector’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 20.8. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that Archer-Daniels-Midland has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 14.7, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for Archer-Daniels-Midland’s stock in the near term too.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Archer-Daniels-Midland has a P/S ratio of about 0.4. This is substantially lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.3 right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is slightly below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.If anything, Archer-Daniels-Midland is towards the higher end of its range in the time period from a P/S metric, which suggests that the company’s stock price has already appreciated to some degree, relative to its sales.  Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Archer-Daniels-Midland currently has a Value Style Score of B, putting it into the top 40% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes ADM a solid choice for value investors.What About the Stock Overall?Though Archer-Daniels-Midland might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of F and a Momentum score of A. This gives ADM a VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of C. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging. The current quarter has seen three estimates go higher in the past sixty days and one lower, while the full year estimate has seen four upward and no downward revisions in the same time period.This has had a favorable impact on the consensus estimate, as the current quarter consensus estimate has increased nearly 10.3% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has risen about 4.1%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Archer Daniels Midland Company Price and Consensus  Archer Daniels Midland Company Price and Consensus | Archer Daniels Midland Company QuoteEven though Archer-Daniels-Midland has a better estimates trend, the stock has just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). That is why we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineArcher-Daniels-Midland is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Moreover, a strong industry rank (top 12% out of more than 250 industries) further supports the growth potential of the stock. However, with a Zacks Rank #3, it is hard to get too excited about this company overall. In fact, over the past one year, the sector has clearly underperformed the broader market, as you can see below:Despite positive estimate revision activity, investors should wait for industry trends to turn around first.  When it does, this stock could be a compelling value pick.5 Medical Stocks to Buy NowZacks names 5 companies poised to ride a medical breakthrough that is targeting cures for leukemia, AIDS, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, and other conditions.New products in this field are already generating substantial revenue and even more wondrous treatments are in the pipeline.

Earlier, the company used to report operational results under the Agricultural Services, Corn Processing, Oilseeds Processing and, Wild Flavors and Specialty Ingredients segments.According to the reclassification, the Carbohydrate Solutions segment will comprise the Corn and Milling operations; Nutrition unit will include Animal Nutrition and Bioactives businesses as well as the Wild Flavors & Specialty Ingredients segment (WFSI); the Oilseeds segment will remain unchanged; and Origination will include the Agricultural Services business, excluding Milling.Archer Daniels Midland Company Price and Consensus Archer Daniels Midland Company Price and Consensus | Archer Daniels Midland Company QuoteGoing by segments, quarterly revenues at Oilseeds, Carbohydrate Solutions and Nutrition were up 7.8%, 4.5% and 11.1%, respectively, to $5,633 million, $2,622 million and $950 million. Also, revenues grew 12.8% to $106 million at the Other segment in the first quarter. However, revenues declined 1.4% to $6,215 million at the Origination segment.Operational DiscussionArcher Daniels reported adjusted segment operating profit of $717 million in first-quarter 2018, up 5.7% from the year-ago quarter. On a GAAP basis, the company’s segment operating profit rose 4.1% year over year to $704 million.On a segmental adjusted basis, adjusted operating profit for the Oilseeds segment climbed 11.8% year over year to $350 million. The uptick can be attributed to robust global market dynamics that lead to increased soybean crush margins. Notably, this segment witnessed crush volume records in North and South America. Further, sturdy origination volumes and higher margins were witnessed in South America. Additionally, robust results at Refining, Packaging, Biodiesel and Other operations aided segment’s growth. However, results were soft year over year at Crushing and Origination along with lower contributions from Wilmar.Carbohydrate Solutions segment’s adjusted operating profit inched up 0.9% to $213 million. Results benefited from enhanced results from joint ventures in North America as well as robust Starches and Sweeteners results. Moreover, Wheat Milling results rose year over year on higher margins. However, Bioproducts results were hurt by soft ethanol margins.Nutrition segment’s adjusted operating profit rose 24.7% to $96 million. The upside stemmed from double-digit profit growth at Wild Flavors and results at Animal Nutrition grew substantially on solid trade sales and favorable product mix. However, the improvement was somewhat compensated with soft results at Specialty Ingredients.However, adjusted operating profit for the Origination segment’s declined 4.3% to $45 million. During the quarter, gains from solid Merchandising and Handling results as well as sturdy Global Trade owing to higher volumes and margins were more than offset by weak U.S. export volumes and nearly $40 million of mark-to-market impact on existing contracts. Additionally, transportation results declined year over year, leading to higher operating expenses.FinancialsArcher Daniels ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $797 million, long-term debt including current maturities of $6,670 million and shareholders’ equity of $18,737 million.In the first quarter of 2018, Archer Daniels generated negative cash of $3,574 million from operating activities. Further, the company’s trailing four-quarter average adjusted ROIC came in at 6.4%.Additionally, the company paid dividends of $190 million to shareholders in the quarter.Looking AheadManagement remains impressed with its quarterly results, which gained from the company’s strategic initiatives and cost-saving efforts. Moving ahead, Archer Daniels remains focused on five major platforms, animal nutrition, bioactives, carbohydrates, human nutrition and taste along with geographic regions to drive growth.Archer Daniels remains optimistic to deliver solid results in 2018 on the back of improving market conditions, gains from U.S. tax reform, product innovations and Project Readiness.Want More of Consumer Staples Stocks?

303,ADM,"The Q1 earnings season is in full swing with a deluge of companies reporting their financial numbers each day. The picture that is evolving is an extremely rosy one. According to our latest Earnings Preview report,  76.8% of the companies have reported better-than-expected earnings per share in the current reporting cycle.Generally, an earnings beat leads to an uptick in a company’s stock price. Given this highly bullish backdrop, it is natural that investors would like to add outperformers to their respective portfolios for healthy returns.However, with a plethora of earnings reports flooding the market during the reporting cycle, pinpointing outperformers or well-performing stocks is by no means an easy task for individual investors. In the absence of proper guidance, identifying a winning stock is akin to searching for ‘a needle in a haystack’, for an investor. Proper guidance, in this respect, comes from brokers, who are deemed to be experts, equipped with vast knowledge and know how as far the field of investing is concerned.Of the three types of brokers/analysts (sell-side, buy-side and independent) present in the investment world, sell-side analysts are most common. Various brokerage firms employ them to provide unbiased opinion to investors after thorough research. Buy-side analysts are employed by hedge funds, mutual funds etc. while the independent ones simply sell their reports to investors.Brokers, not only scrutinize the publicly available financial documents, but also attend company conference calls and other presentations. Naturally, it is in the best interest of investors to pay heed to such well-researched information as they aim to generate maximum returns from their portfolio.Earnings Estimate Revisions – An Useful GuideSince brokers indulge in thorough research, the question of their actions being arbitrary does not arise. Therefore, the direction of estimate revisions by brokers serves as an important pointer regarding the price of a stock. In fact, a rating upgrade normally leads to stock price appreciation and vice versa.One of the well-accepted investment strategies is to maintain a diversified portfolio to generate handsome returns irrespective of the market conditions. For instance, in the face of extremely low oil prices, analysts adopt a bullish stance on airline stocks and consequently raise estimates. Naturally, adding such stocks to one’s portfolio in such a scenario might prove to be a winning strategy. Similarly, analysts might turn bearish and trim estimates, thereby downgrading a stock, following adverse events like lackluster earnings or pipeline failure (for a biotech player). Naturally, investors would look to get rid of such stocks from their portfolio on the basis of broker advice.To take into account earnings performance, we have designed a screen based on improving analyst recommendation and upward estimate revisions over the last four weeks.Ignore the Top Line at Your PerilA strategy designed solely on the basis of the bottom line is unlikely to result in a winning strategy. Actually, according to many market watchers, a revenue beat is more creditable for a company, especially in an environment of revenue weakness due to macroeconomic headwinds like a strong dollar or lackluster demand for travel (which will hurt travel-focused companies). To address top-line concerns, we have included in our screen the price/sales ratio, which serves as a strong complementary valuation metric.Screening Criteria# (Up- Down Rating)/ Total (4 weeks) =Top #75: This gives the list of top 75 companies that have witnessed net upgrades over the last 4 weeks.% change in Q (1) est. (4 weeks) = Top #10: This gives the top 10 stocks that have witnessed earnings estimate revisions over the past 4 weeks for the upcoming quarter.To ensure that the strategy is a winning one, covering all bases, we have added the following screening parameters:Price-to-Sales = Bot%10: The lower the ratio the better, companies meeting this criteria are in bottom 10% of our universe of over 7,700 stocks with respect to this ratio.Price greater than 5: A stock trading below $5 will not likely create significant interest for most investors.Average Daily Volume greater than 100,000 shares over the last 20 trading days: Volume has to be significant to ensure that these are easily traded.Market value ($ mil) = Top #3000: This gives us stocks that are the top 3000 if one judges by market capitalization.Com/ADR/Canadian= Com: This takes out the ADR and Canadian stocks.Here are five of the 10 stocks that made it through the screen:Archer Daniels Midland Company (ADM  -  Free Report)  is one of the leading food processing companies in the world.

305,ADM,"The first-quarter earnings season is past the halfway mark, with more than 900 companies including 142 S&P 500 members due to report results this week.According to the latest Earnings Preview, results of 267 S&P 500 members are already out. As of Apr 27, 2018, total earnings for these S&P 500 members were up 25.1% year over year on more than 10% higher revenues. Of these, 76.8% surpassed earnings estimates, while 73.8% beat revenue expectations.Total earnings for the S&P 500 index are likely to increase 22.6% from the same period last year on 8.4% higher revenues. Total earnings for consumer staples companies are expected to grow 6.8% while revenues are likely to increase 3.1% in the first quarter of 2018.Some of the key players in the sector — Procter & Gamble (PG  -  Free Report), PepsiCo (PEP  -  Free Report) and Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report) — have already released their quarterly numbers. Procter & Gamble, popularly known as P&G, reported third-quarter fiscal 2018 financial results, wherein both earnings and revenues surpassed expectations, benefiting from higher demand for skincare products, along with fabric and home care products. The company has also lifted its core earnings per share guidance.PepsiCo reported first-quarter 2018 results, with earnings and revenues both beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Notably, this is the eighth consecutive quarter of positive earnings surprise for the company. The improvement was mainly attributable to strong performances in its international divisions, propelled by higher revenue growth in developing and emerging markets.Coca-Cola started 2018 on a strong note, beating the consensus mark on both counts in the first quarter. Apart from a significant rise in soda volumes, the cola giant gained from its growing beverage portfolio and restructuring efforts. Cost-cutting initiatives led by refranchising of its low-margin bottling operations, helped it to come up with better numbers.Let’s take a look at what’s in store for the following stocks within the consumer staples sector that are scheduled to release first-quarter 2018 results on May 1.Mondelez International, Inc. (MDLZ  -  Free Report) delivered a positive earnings surprise of 1.79% last quarter. The Oreo-maker surpassed estimates in all the trailing four quarters, with the average positive surprise being 4.43%.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Mondelez is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You may uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Mondelez has an Earnings ESP of +0.34% and Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Strong Sell) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The food industry within the consumer staples sector has been witnessing sluggish growth and slowdown in consumption for the past few quarters. The industry is experiencing changes in consumer preference (for example, a shift toward products with less artificial sweeteners, sodium and saturated fat) and consumer dynamics (such as increased need for portable and on-the-go products), demographic shifts and also a shift in demand for low-priced products.Mondelez, like other legacy brands including General Mills Inc. (GIS  -  Free Report), The Kraft Heinz Company (KHC  -  Free Report) and The Kellogg Company (K  -  Free Report), has been facing challenges to boost its volume since 2014.Nonetheless, in order to counter the tepid sales trend, Mondelez has been focusing on innovation and brand building. The company has also undertaken some major steps to improve margins, cash flow and return on invested capital. Mondelez’s to-be-reported quarter’s results are likely to gain from its Power Brands, favorable trends in emerging markets, higher pricing, productivity and cost saving initiatives, partly offset by higher input costs.For the first quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 61 cents, indicating a 15.1% year-over-year increase. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues is pegged at $6.66 billion, implying 3.8% growth.(Read More: Will Cost Saving Plans Aid Mondelez's Q1 Earnings?) Mondelez International, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Mondelez International, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Mondelez International, Inc. QuoteArcher-Daniels-Midland Company (ADM  -  Free Report) is a leading food processing company. In the last reported quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 17.14%. The company has a mixed record of earnings surprise in the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 1.7%.Our proven model does not show that Archer Daniels is likely to beat earnings estimates in the to-be-reported quarter. Archer Daniels sports a Zacks Rank #1, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company’s Earnings ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.Archer Daniels has a dismal surprise history. In fact, the company has been lagging sales estimates for more than three years now. Notably, analysts polled by Zacks expect first-quarter revenues to be $14.52 billion, down 3.1% from the year-ago quarter. Though the company delivered earnings beat in fourth-quarter 2017, it recorded negative surprise in eight of the preceding 10 quarters. This drab performance can be attributed to fluctuating commodity prices, oversupply in the industry and unfavorable margins.However, Archer Daniels’ focus on cost savings to strengthen its business has been offsetting the sales headwind to some extent. Overall, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of 50 cents for the quarter under review reflects a decline of 16.7% year over year.

306,ADM,"Colgate-Palmolive Co. (CL  -  Free Report) posted adjusted earnings of 74 cents a share in first-quarter 2018, up 10.4% from the prior-year quarter. The figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 73 cents. Including one-time items, earnings were 72 cents a share compared with 64 cents reported in the year-ago period.Total sales of $4,002 million improved 6.5% from the year-ago period but lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4,018 million. The top line gained from 2% increase in global unit volumes and 4.5% favorable currency impact while the pricing remained flat. During the reported quarter, unit-volume growth included a 0.5% contribution from recently-acquired professional skin care businesses. However, the sales lag can be attributed to soft category growth across many markets.Colgate-Palmolive Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Colgate-Palmolive Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Colgate-Palmolive Company QuoteOn an organic basis (excluding foreign exchange, acquisitions and divestitures), the company’s sales advanced 1.5%, which was below expectations. Lower organic sales resulted from flat unit-volume growth in emerging markets. However, unit volume improved 4.5% and organic volumes were up 3% in developed markets, driven by strength in North America and Europe.Following the earnings release, Colgate’s shares declined 3.9% in the pre-market trading hours. Though the Colgate stock fell 3.8% in the last six months, it outperformed the broader industry’s decline of 8.3%.Deeper InsightAdjusted gross profit margin of 60.3% contracted 40 basis points (bps) from the prior-year quarter, driven by higher raw- and packaging-material expenses. However, this was partially offset by gains from the cost-saving initiatives under the company’s funding-the-growth program.In the reported quarter, adjusted operating profit of $1,007 million increased 5% while the adjusted operating margin contracting 20 bps to 25.2%. Operating margin decline can be attributed to lower gross margin, partly negated by 30 bps decline in adjusted selling, general & administrative expenses as a percentage of sales.Year to date, Colgate’s market share of manual toothbrushes has reached 32.5%. Further, the company continued with its leadership in the global toothpaste market with 42.4% market share year to date.Segment DiscussionNorth America net sales (21% of total sales) improved 9%, reflecting a 9% increase in unit volumes and 0.5% favorable currency impacts, offset by 0.5% fall in pricing. On an organic basis, sales increased 5% while unit volume grew 5.5%.Latin America net sales (23% of total sales) inched up 0.5% year over year, driven by 0.5% increase in pricing. However, unit volume and currency remained flat year over year. During the quarter, volume growth in Brazil was negated by soft volumes in Mexico. On an organic basis, sales increased 0.5% as well.Europe net sales (16% of total sales) rose 16% year over year, due to 4% increase in unit volumes and a favorable currency impact of 14.5%, offset by 2.5% decline in pricing. Unit volumes gained from strength in France and Italy. Organic sales in Europe were up 1.5%.Asia Pacific net sales (19% of total sales) rose 5.5%, attributable to 0.5% increase in unit volume and positive currency impacts of 5.5%, partly compensated by 0.5% lower pricing. Volumes benefited from strength in India and the Philippines, which was partly neutralized by declines in the Greater China and Australia. On an organic basis, sales for the Asia Pacific were flat.Africa/Eurasia net sales (6% of total sales) rose 3.5% year over year, fueled by 2.5% higher pricing and 4.5% gains from positive currency, partly offset by 3.5% drop in unit volumes. Lower volumes are attributed to the decline in South Africa. Organic sales for Africa/Eurasia dropped 1%.Hill’s Pet Nutrition net sales (15% of total sales) were up 5.5% from the year-ago quarter. Results gained from 0.5% rise in unit volumes, 1% increase in pricing and 4% positive impact from currency. Volume gains in the United States, Brazil and Australia were offset by the fall in Japan. On an organic basis, sales rose 1.5%.Other Financial DetailsColgate ended the first quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $851 million and total debt of $6,709 million. Net cash provided by operating activities was $616 million as of Mar 31, 2018.OutlookLooking into 2018, Colgate anticipates the backdrop to remain challenging, due to uncertain global markets and slowing category growth worldwide. However, the company remains on track with the brand building and productivity maximization initiatives. Consequently, it expects net sales to increase in mid-single-digit in 2018 while organic sales are likely to grow in a low to mid-single-digit. Further, the company anticipates witnessing sequential improvement in organic sales through the rest of the year.Including the impact of the expanded Global Growth and Efficiency Program, the company continues to expect gross margin growth in 2018 along with double-digits increase in GAAP earnings per share.Excluding the restructuring charges, resulting from the program and other one-time expenses associated with U.S. tax reform in 2017, the company projects strong cash flow generation, gross margin expansion and higher advertising investments in 2018. Further, it anticipates low double-digit earnings-per-share growth for the year, on an adjusted basis.Zacks Rank & Key PicksColgate currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

307,ADM,"A 52-week high level works as an indicator for investors as stocks near that level are considered winners.However, investors often wonder if the high price has made the stock overpriced. While they are not totally incorrect, all stocks hitting a 52-week high are not necessarily overpriced.In fact, an investor might miss out on top gainers in a bid to avoid the steep prices of stocks that are near the 52-week high mark.However, a stock can maintain the momentum and keep scaling new highs with time. So, one should take a more informed approach to understand if any further upside is left.Here we discuss a strategy to find the right stocks:Borrowing from the basics of momentum investing, this technique bets on the catchphrase “buy high, sell higher.”52-Week High: A Good IndicatorMany a time, stocks hitting a 52-week high are prevented from scaling higher despite potential due to the psychological bias of investors, who fear that the stocks are overvalued and a price crash is impending.In fact, overvaluation is quite natural for most of these stocks as investors’ particular attention (or willingness to pay premium) has helped them reach the level. But that doesn’t always mean an impending decline. The factors — such as robust sales, surging profit levels, earnings growth prospects and strategic acquisitions — that encouraged investors to bet on these stocks could keep them motivated if there is no tangible negative. In other words, the momentum might continue.Also, when a string of positive developments dominate the market, investors find their under-reaction unwarranted, even if there are no company-specific driving forces.Setting the Right FiltersWe ran a screen to zero in on 52-week high stocks (trading near the high level) that hold tremendous upside potential. The screen includes parameters to shortlist stocks with strong earnings growth expectations, sturdy value metrics and price momentum.Moreover, the screen filters stocks that are relatively undervalued compared to peers, in terms of earnings as well as sales, ensuring continuation of their rally for some time.Current Price/52 Week High >= .80This is the ratio between the current price and the highest price at which the stock has traded in the past 52 weeks. A value greater than 0.8 implies that the stock is trading within 20% of its 52-week high range.% Change Price – 4 Weeks > 0It ensures that the stock price has moved north over the past four weeks.% Change Price – 12 Weeks > 0This metric guarantees a continued upward price momentum for the stock over the past three months as well.Price/Sales <= XIndMedThe lower, the better.P/E using F(1) Estimate <= XIndMedThis metric measures the amount an investor puts into a company to obtain one dollar of earnings. It narrows down the list of stocks to those that are undervalued compared to the industry.One-Year EPS Growth F(1)/F(0) >= XIndMedThis helps choose stocks that have higher growth rates than the industry. This is a meaningful indicator, as decent earnings growth adds to investor optimism.Zacks Rank <=2No screening is complete without our proven Zacks Rank, which has proved its worth since inception. It is a fundamental truth that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) have always managed to brave adversities and beat the market. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Current Price >= 5This parameter will help screen stocks that are trading at $5 or higher.Volume – 20 days (shares) >= 100000Inclusion of this metric ensures that there is a substantial volume of shares, so trading is easier.Here are five of the 29 stocks that made it through the screen:Archer Daniels Midland Company (ADM  -  Free Report) is one of the leading food processing companies in the world. It procures, transports, stores, processes, and merchandises agricultural commodities and products. The company has an average four-quarter positive earnings surprise of 1.7%.AMN Healthcare Services Inc (AMN  -  Free Report) provides physician and nursing recruitment and placement services for hospitals, clinics, medical centers, government facilities, and other healthcare organizations in travel or permanent assignments.

309,ADM,"The Consumer Staples sector includes companies that provide necessities and products used in daily lives, thus proving to be a defensive zone. With firms providing food, beverages, soap and cleaning materials and products related to beauty and personal care among others, consumer staples is always go-to place for investors who want to play it safe during economic downturns.In fact, tobacco and alcohol players usually do well when economic conditions are not congenial. Clearly, adding stocks from the consumer staples basket usually lends more stability to investors’ portfolios. Moreover, the sector remains a lucrative space for income-seeking investors, given its strong dividend yield and growth rate.Before analyzing the trends of the consumer staples space, let’s take a look at the U.S. economy – which appears to be quite well placed. We believe that favorable economic indicators like consumer spending and consumer confidence, among others, are likely to benefit consumer-driven staples companies.U.S. Economic Picture Looks RosyThe overall economy appears to be in decent shape thanks to favorable consumer spending, a strong labor market, rising government expenditures and increased consumer confidence. Notably, the Consumer Confidence Index rose to 128.7 for April, in comparison to 127.0 in March. Moreover, the unemployment level has remained at a 17-year low of 4.1% for six months in a row now.Clearly, these factors give positive signals for consumer staples companies, most of which are also likely to gain from President Trump’s tax cuts. In fact, during the last quarter, several companies raised their full-year earnings outlooks, on the back of expected gains from tax reforms.Is Everything Perfect for Consumer Staples?Courtesy of the favorable economic conditions, consumer-driven companies appear well placed. However, the possibility of a trade war with China continues to raise fears for companies whose business operations are likely to be hit by tariffs. Also, apprehensions remain related to three or more rate hikes by Fed this year, as these may weigh on consumer spending and make the dollar stronger against other currencies. This poses threats to companies with significant exposure to emerging markets.Speaking of emerging markets, consumer staples garner significant revenues from these regions. While some emerging markets are witnessing improved trends, exchange rate volatility and other global risks remain. Moreover, intense competition, price wars and a high promotional environment pose threats to margins. Additionally, greater marketing costs, along with volatile input prices and higher freight expenses, remain concerns for the sector that has lost 6.2% in the past six months, in comparison to the S&P 500’s gain of 4%.Nevertheless, the companies are undertaking aggressive efforts to curtail costs and keep pace with shifting consumer patterns. With regard to the latter, the sector players remain committed to adopting the e-commerce mantra, alongside adding organic products to their portfolios. Also, consumer staple players should continue gaining from solid focus on innovation, product launches and strategic buyouts. Given all the pros and cons, let’s see how the Zacks Consumer Staples sector is placed.Consumer Staples Sector – FavorableStocks in the Consumer Staples sector have been laggards lately, with the sector lagging the S&P 500 index in the year-to-date and trailing 12-month period. The sector has lost 4.3% of its value in the past year, under-performing the S&P 500 index’s +12.9% gain.The sector’s valuation picture has improved following recent weakness, with the sector currently trading at 21.6X trailing 12-month earnings. The sector was trading at 24.3X in January 2018 and 25.8X in May 2017.Over the last 5 years, the Consumer Staples sector has traded as high as 25.9X trailing 12-month earnings and as low as 19.5X, with a 5-year median of 21.7X.The sector has always traded at a valuation premium to the S&P 500 index, though the premium commanded at present is one of the lowest in recent years. The S&P 500 index is currently trading at 20.4X trailing 12-month earnings, with the index’s 5-year high, low and median at 21.9X, 15.3X and 18X, respectively. All in all, the sector appears attractive on valuation grounds.Zacks Industry Rank – PositiveWithin the Zacks Industry classification, Consumer Staples is one of the 16 Zacks sectors, which is further sub-divided into 16 industries at the expanded (or “X”) level – Publishing - Periodicals, Textile - Apparel, Food - Meat Products, Funeral Services, Publishing -Books, Food – Dairy Products, Publishing -Newspapers, Food -Confectionery, Beverages - Alcohol, Food - Miscellaneous, Soap and Cleaning Materials, Agriculture - Operations, Tobacco, Beverages - Soft Drinks, Consumer Products - Staples and Cosmetics.We rank all the 250 plus industries in the 16 Zacks sectors based on the earnings outlook and fundamental strength of the constituent companies.

310,ADM,"Newell Brands Inc. (NWL  -  Free Report) reported mixed first-quarter 2018 results wherein the company’s bottom line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate while the top line marginally lagged the same. While this marked the company’s second straight earnings beat, sales however, delivered a negative surprise after surpassing expectations in the fourth quarter of 2017. Further, management retained its 2018 view.This Hoboken, NJ-based company posted normalized earnings of 34 cents per share, which outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 26 cents but remained flat year over year. The bottom line gained from cost savings, favorable pricing, gains from acquisitions and a lower tax rate, compensated with the lost earnings from divested operations, fall in core sales and commodity cost inflation.On a reported basis, earnings per share came in at 11 cents compared with $1.31 earned in the year-ago quarter.Newell Brands Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Newell Brands Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Newell Brands Inc. Quote Net sales of $3,017.4 million fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3,039 million as well as declined 7.6% year over year on account of the adverse impact of last year’s divestitures, net of buyouts. Also, the top line was hurt by the disrupted business of the Baby division along with a considerable inventory destocking in the Writing division’s office superstore and distributive trade channels. Further, core sales fell 3.5%, mainly due to Writing and Baby.Normalized gross margin contracted 120 basis points (bps) to 33.3% while normalized operating margin declined 190 bps to 8.7% in the quarter under review.Following the quarterly results and divestment news, shares of Newell gained 3.1% in pre-market trading session. However, this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) stock has lost 13.4% in the past six months, wider than the industry’s decline of 9%. Segment PerformanceLive segment net sales inched up 0.4% to $1,071.6 million from the year-ago period. However, core sales decreased 3.1% on account of improvement in Appliances & Cookware, which was more than offset by a high-single digit fall in Baby business.Net sales at Learn segment came in at $495.4 million, down 13% from the prior-year period. Core sales dropped 14.3%, mainly due to decline in Writing business.Work segment net sales of $640.7 million grew 4.4% year over year. Also, core sales rose 5.5% on account of continued strength in Waddington and Safety & Security.Net sales at the Play segment came in at $616.8 million, down 1.8% from the prior-year period. Core sales dipped 2.6% due to fall in Outdoor & Recreation, compensated with sturdy growth registered in Team Sports.The Other segment net sales of $192.9 million plunged 50.2% from the prior-year quarter on account of the divestitures of the Tools, Winter Sports, Fire Starter and Fire Log plus Cordage businesses. Core sales declined 4.1% due to weakness in Process Solutions, partly offset by improvement in U.S. Playing Cards.Transformation Plan UpdateIn line with its Accelerated Transformation Plan, Newell inked a deal to divest its packaging maker, The Waddington Group, to Novolex for roughly $2.3 billion. The transaction, anticipated to close within 60 days, is likely to generate after-tax proceeds of about $2.2 billion, which will be further used in deleveraging and share repurchase. Moreover, Newell adds Jostens and Pure Fishing brands to the list of potential divestitures.The above positive moves are expected to speed up value creation and transform the portfolio to leverage the company’s abilities with respect to innovation, design and e-commerce. Also, it will help improve operational performance, deleverage the balance sheet as well as enhance the shareholder value.The key aspects of this Transformation Plan are restructuring the company into a global consumer products’ entity, valued at more than $9 billion along with major brands in seven consumer segments; offloading non-core businesses that account for nearly 35% of the company’s sales, utilizing $10 billion after-tax proceeds from divestitures and a free cash flow to lower debt plus make share repurchase as well as retaining investment grade rating and an annual dividend of 92 cents per share through 2019, targeting 30-35% payout ratio.The above will likely generate net sales of above $9 billion, boosting shareholder value and financial flexibility. Newell progresses well with its divestiture operations and anticipates the same to be completed by the end of 2019. Thereafter, management projects sales of roughly $9.5 billion with normalized operating margin expansion of more than 15% by 2020.Other Financial DetailsNewell ended the first quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $459 million, long-term debt of $9,623.5 million and shareholders’ equity of $14,130.9 million, excluding non-controlling interests of $36.4 million.The company reported negative operating cash flow of $401.7 million compared with negative $263.6 million in the prior-year period.

311,ADM,"Archer Daniels Midland Company (ADM  -  Free Report) is slated to report first-quarter 2018 results on May 1. The company has a mixed record of earnings surprise in the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 1.7%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of 56 cents for the quarter under review moved south by 3 cents in the last seven days and reflects a decline of 6.7% year over year.Archer Daniels Midland Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Archer Daniels Midland Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Archer Daniels Midland Company QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up prior to the first-quarter earnings announcement.Factors at PlayArcher Daniels has been struggling with a dismal surprise history for quite a long time. In fact, the company has lagged sales estimates for more than three years now. Notably, analysts polled by Zacks expect first-quarter revenues to be $14,965 million, down 0.2% from the year-ago quarter. Though the company delivered earnings beat in fourth-quarter 2017, it recorded negative surprises in eight of the preceding 10 quarters. This drab performance can be attributed to fluctuating commodity prices, oversupply in the industry and unfavorable margins.In the previous quarter, the company’s margins remained under pressure due to soft operating performance at the Oilseeds Processing segment. Despite robust crush volumes and persistent growth in demand, results were hurt by soft crush margins and lower South American origination margins. These factors also hampered Crushing and Origination results. Additionally, soft biodiesel results affected Refining, Packaging, Biodiesel and Other operations.However, Archer Daniels’ solid focus on cost savings to strengthen business is commendable. It remains focused on cost synergy activities by addressing redundancies and removing overlapping corporate SG&A. Furthermore, the company’s Project Readiness program that aims at enhancing operational efficiency at production and supply chain networks to curtail costs bodes well. Management has also been on track with business transformation, under its 1ADM program.In March, management realigned its business into four segments namely Carbohydrate Solutions, Nutrition, Oilseeds and Origination, to accelerate growth and resonate well with changing customers’ needs. These changes will be reflected in first-quarter 2018 results. The new business segments are expected to clearly differentiate the company’s product and service offerings, while justifying its operating structure. Additionally, the segments should help Archer Daniels provide value-added and exclusive product assortments, hence boost growth across its business portfolio. These efforts, in turn, are likely to add stimulus to the company’s performance and profitability.Given the major strengths and weaknesses, let’s wait and see what lies ahead for Archer Daniels when it reports quarterly results.What Does the Zacks Model Say?Our proven model does not show that Archer Daniels is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter.

313,ADM,"Shares of Dean Foods Company (DF  -  Free Report) touched a 52-week low of $8.15 on Apr 16, closing the session at $8.16. The company has long been grappling with lower product volumes, higher raw milk costs and loss of share in U.S. fluid milk volumes, which has been largely weighing on its performance.Per analysts, softening demand for milk has also been taking a toll on Dean Foods for quite some time now, sending its shares to six year low. Non-dairy substitutes such as almond and oat milk along with other beverages have been marring demand for milk.Meanwhile, the retail grocery industry experienced significant consolidation in recent years, due to which competition has intensified among dairy product suppliers.These factors have hurt investors’ sentiments. Consequently, shares of this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) have lost 58.1%, wider than the industry’s decline of 52.9% in the past year.In fourth-quarter 2017, the company reverted to negative earnings surprise trend after reporting in-line earnings in the previous quarter, alongside posting third straight sales miss. Both the top and the bottom line also declined year over year. Results were hurt by soft volumes and higher raw milk costs. Total volumes across all products dropped 6% from the prior-year quarter.As a result, management issued a soft outlook for 2018. Adjusted earnings per share are now envisioned in the range of 55-80 cents versus 80 cents in 2017. Also, first-quarter earnings are anticipated to be disproportionately lower than fourth-quarter 2017. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 13 cents for first quarter and 64 cents for 2018.  Moreover, Dean Foods’ business is heavily dependent on commodities such as raw milk, soybeans, diesel fuel and others, the prices of which often fluctuate. Therefore, any rise in prices of these commodities might hurt margins. In fourth-quarter 2017, adjusted gross profit declined 9.9% while the adjusted operating income was down by 39.2%.Is There Any Silver Lining?Dean Foods has been adhering to various measures to boost operational excellence via execution of the enterprise-wide cost productivity program to generate additional savings in 2018 and beyond. This productivity program mainly revolves around three major areas, including enhancement of its supply-chain network, optimizing spending across all key categories to ensure greater efficiency, and integration of operating model along with minimizing general and administrative expenses.Additionally, the ongoing cost productivity efforts are expected to generate savings in 2018. These savings, in turn, are likely to offset some negative impacts from volume declines and higher non-dairy input costs. While some savings are expected to reflect in 2018, the company anticipates comparatively better savings in 2019 and beyond.Under the OPEX 2020 cost productivity plan introduced in 2017, the company targets annual savings of $80-$100 million. Going ahead, this plan should be extended to the company’s manufacturing and logistics footprint alongside targeting reduction in SG&A expenses. This multi-year plan, which is expected to span across 2018 and 2019, is likely to deliver incremental annual run rate savings of $150 million by 2020.We believe these efforts will take time to bear fruit and aid a turnaround for Dean Foods. However, the recent dismal performance suggests trouble down the road.Three Top-Ranked Stocks in the Consumer Staples SpaceMedifast, Inc.

314,ADM,"The Q1 earnings season is at an early stage with reports available from only a handful of companies. A high proportion of companies are yet to unveil their numbers. This is a very busy time for investors looking to add stocks, which have the potential to surpass earnings expectations in the current reporting cycle. This is because an earnings beat generally leads to stock price appreciation.However, the task of selecting stocks for handsome returns is by no means easy with a plethora of stocks flooding the market at any given point in time. The uncertainties in the investment world make the task even more daunting. This is all the more true now, as uncertainty has gripped investors owing to the Syria-related tensions and the well-documented concerns about Facebook.In this backdrop, identifying a winning stock is akin to searching for ‘a needle in a haystack’, for an investor. Proper guidance, in this respect, comes from brokers, who are deemed to be experts, with vast knowledge of investing.Generally, there are three types of brokers/analysts (sell-side, buy-side and independent) present in the investment world. Out of the three, sell-side analysts are most common. Various brokerage firms employ them to provide unbiased opinion to investors after thorough research. Buy-side analysts are employed by hedge funds, mutual funds etc. while the independent ones simply sell their reports to investors.Broker Advice - An Invaluable GuideBrokers not only scrutinize the publicly available financial documents but also attend company conference calls and other presentations. Naturally, it is in the best interest of investors to pay heed to such well-researched information as they aim to generate maximum returns from their portfolio.Since brokers closely follow the stocks in their coverage, they revise earnings estimates only after carefully examining the pros and cons of an event for the concerned company. In fact, a rating upgrade or downgrade by brokers has the potential to influence the price of the stock.Naturally, when investors see brokers revising their estimates or recommendation on a stock, they often assume that there is something in the stock that has attracted analyst attention.In fact, a rating upgrade generally leads to stock price appreciation. Similarly, the price of a stock may plummet following a rating downgrade.Estimates can move north for a number of reasons – favorable earnings performance, a bullish guidance, product launch or any favorable macro scenario.Framing a Winning Strategy The above write-up clearly suggests that by following broker actions, one can arrive at a winning portfolio of stocks. Keeping this in mind, we have designed a screen to shortlist stocks based on improving analyst recommendation and upward revisions in earnings estimates over the last four weeks.Also, since the price/sales ratio is a strong complementary valuation metric in the presence of analyst information, it has been included. The price/sales ratio takes care of the company’s top line, making the strategy foolproof.Screening Criteria# (Up- Down Rating)/ Total (4 weeks) =Top #75 (This gives the list of top 75 companies that have witnessed net upgrades over the last 4 weeks).% change in Q (1) est.

316,ADM,"A stock at a 52-week high level is considered a winner. The level works as an indicator for many investors for buying or selling the stock.More often than not, investors wonder if the high price range has made the stock overpriced. While the apprehensions are not completely groundless, all stocks hitting a 52-week high are not necessarily high-priced.In fact, in an attempt to avoid stocks that are trading near their 52-week high levels, an investor might miss out on top gainers.A stock can continue the momentum and keep scaling new highs with time. So, one should take a more informed approach to understand if any further upside is left.Here we discuss a strategy to find the right stocks:Borrowing from the basics of momentum investing, this technique bets on the catchphrase “buy high, sell higher.”52-Week High: A Good IndicatorMany a time, stocks hitting a 52-week high are prevented from scaling higher despite robust potential due to the psychological bias of investors, who fear that the stocks are overvalued and a price crash is impending.In fact, overvaluation is quite natural for most of these stocks as investors’ particular attention (or willingness to pay premium) has helped them reach the level. But that doesn’t always mean an impending decline. The factors — such as robust sales, surging profit levels, earnings growth prospects and strategic acquisitions — that encouraged investors to bet on these stocks could keep them motivated if there is no tangible negative. In other words, the momentum might continue.Also, when a string of positive developments dominate the market, investors find their under-reaction unwarranted, even if there are no company-specific driving forces.Setting the Right FiltersWe ran a screen to zero in on 52-week high stocks (trading near the high level) that hold tremendous upside potential. The screen includes parameters to shortlist stocks with strong earnings growth expectations, sturdy value metrics and price momentum.Moreover, the screen filters stocks that are relatively undervalued compared to their peers, in terms of earnings as well as sales, ensuring continuation of their rally for some time.Current Price/52 Week High >= .80This is the ratio between the current price and the highest price at which the stock has traded in the past 52 weeks. A value greater than 0.8 implies that the stock is trading within 20% of its 52-week high range.% Change Price – 4 Weeks > 0It ensures that the stock price has moved north over the past four weeks.% Change Price – 12 Weeks > 0This metric guarantees a continued upward price momentum for the stock over the past three months as well.Price/Sales <= XIndMedThe lower, the better.P/E using F(1) Estimate <= XIndMedThis metric measures the amount an investor puts into a company to obtain one dollar of earnings. It narrows down the list of stocks to those that are undervalued compared to the industry.One-Year EPS Growth F(1)/F(0) >= XIndMedThis helps choose stocks that have higher growth rates than the industry. This is a meaningful indicator, as decent earnings growth adds to investor optimism.Zacks Rank <=2No screening is complete without our proven Zacks Rank, which has proved its worth since inception. It is a fundamental truth that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) have always managed to brave adversities and beat the market. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Current Price >= 5This parameter will help screen stocks that are trading at $5 or higher.Volume – 20 days (shares) >= 100000Inclusion of this metric ensures that there is a substantial volume of shares, so trading is easier.Here are five of the 16 stocks that made it through the screen:Archer Daniels Midland Company (ADM  -  Free Report) is one of the leading food processing companies in the world. It procures, transports, stores, processes, and merchandises agricultural commodities and products.

317,ADM,"After a brutal week, Wall Street resumed its rally by regaining momentum in the technology sector, solid earnings expectations and easing fears over trade tension. In fact, China’s President Xi Jinping at a major conference in Asia calmed an escalating trade dispute with the United States by promising to open the country’s economy further and lower import tariffs on products including cars.Earnings for the S&P 500 index are expected to grow 16% from the same period last year on 7.4% higher revenues. Earnings growth is much higher than the Q4 growth of 13.5% and represents the highest quarterly earnings growth in seven years. Additionally, improving global growth and tax reform are acting as a key catalyst for the stock market (read: Bet on These Sector ETFs & Stocks for Q1 Earnings).Notably, $1.5 trillion tax cuts will save billions in the corporate world, boosting earnings and reflation trade. It would further spark a wave of share buybacks, dividend hikes and mergers & acquisitions. All these suggest that a nine-year bull market still has legs and will strengthen the second-largest bull run in the history. Further, growth in the U.S. economy has been solid, courtesy of an impressive labor market, higher wages, increasing consumer spending and record consumer confidence.Amid bullish sentiments and defused trade war fears, which have led to wild swings, momentum investing would be a winning strategy for those seeking higher returns in a short spell.

319,ADM,"The Clorox Company (CLX  -  Free Report) remains keen on making strategic partnerships with retail customers and evolving capabilities both in the physical world and online. With focus on investing in brands being a key part of its strategy, this consumer products’ maker recently agreed to purchase Nutranext — the Florida-based dietary supplements leader — for $700 million.The deal is expected to expand the Clorox's dietary supplements business, thereby accelerating growth of its top brands in the fast-growing categories alongside focusing on health and wellness. It also acquired the RenewLife brand, digestive health leader in May 2016, which has been significantly contributing to the Clorox’s e-commerce and extended distribution in the retail businesses.Expected to close in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, the deal is likely to reduce GAAP earnings by 7-11 cents per share in the quarter and 8-12 cents in fiscal 2019. Thereafter, the deal will be accretive to earnings in fiscal 2020. Clorox plans to finance the deal with cash and debt, while retaining its Debt/EBITDA ratio range of 2.0x to 2.5x.Last year, Nutranext generated sales of nearly $200 million and the purchase price reflects about 3.5 times of sales. Around 90% of this multi-vitamins maker’s revenue is generated in the United States. Its products are sold in the retail and e-commerce channels and through the direct-to-consumer business. Nutranext markets multi-vitamins under the Rainbow Light brand, specialty minerals under the Natural Vitality brand and supplements for hair, skin and nails under the Neocell brand, among others.Though Clorox has a solid earnings surprise history, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company witnessed significant pressure on gross margin in the second quarter of fiscal 2018. The margin contraction can be attributed to elevated input costs for commodities and tightening of transportation market, which are likely to continue in fiscal 2018. However, we believe deals like this are likely to expand Clorox’s margins and the overall profitability.In the past month, Clorox has inched up 0.1% faring better than the industry’s decline of 2%.Three Hot Picks in the Consumer Staples SpacePost Holdings, Inc.

320,ADM,"Colgate-Palmolive Company (CL  -  Free Report) is amongst those companies who regularly enhance its shareholders’ value via dividend payouts and share buybacks. Additionally, the company has been consistently increasing dividend rate every year since 2001. Keeping up with the trend, Colgate increased quarterly dividend by 5% to 42 cents from the previous payout of 40 cents per share. Effective second-quarter 2018, this will bring the company’s annualized dividend to $1.68 per share. The new dividend will be paid on May 15, 2018, to shareholders on record as of Apr 20.On Jan 11, 2018, Colgate declared its first-quarter cash dividend of 40 cents per share, paid on Feb 15.In fact, the company has to its credit a robust history of rewarding shareholders with regular quarterly dividend payouts since 1895. Since then, Colgate has paid dividends every quarter, even amid economic crises like the Great Depression of the 1930s, stagflation in the 1970s and the recession of 2008.However, following the latest dividend hike not much movement was noticed in the company’s share price yesterday. In the past three months, the stock has lost 4.8%, narrower than the industry’s decline of 8.8%.Notably, dividend hikes not only enhance shareholders’ return but raise the market value of the stock as well. In fact, through these dividend increases companies persuade investors to either buy or hold the scrip instead of selling it. Now, it remains to be seen whether this recent hike will help Colgate in regaining the lost momentum.Prior to the current dividend hike, management had raised quarterly dividend by 3% to 40 cents per share versus 39 cents, in March 2017. Apart from highlighting commitment toward creating shareholder value, regular dividend payments and increments, reflect the company’s potential to enhance earnings and cash flow generation capabilities. Evidently, in 2017, the company returned about $2.9 billion to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks, which marked a year-over-year increase of nearly 3%. Also, this leading manufacturer of consumer products generated $3,054 million of cash from operations in and deployed $553 million toward capital expenditures the same time period.Apart from Colgate, companies like Archer Daniels Midland Company (ADM  -  Free Report), The Home Depot, Inc. (HD  -  Free Report) and DICK'S Sporting Goods, Inc. (DKS  -  Free Report) remain keen on rewarding shareholders through share repurchases and regular dividend payments. Recently, these companies have also declared dividend hikes.Archer Daniels raised its dividend by 4.7% to 33.5 cents per share, which is payable on Mar 13, 2018. Home Depot declared a 15.7% increase in its quarterly dividend to $1.03 per share, payable on Mar 22. DICK'S Sporting Goods approved a quarterly dividend hike of nearly 32% to 22.50 cents per share, payable on Mar 30.Colgate carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

321,ADM,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Archer Daniels Midland Company (ADM  -  Free Report). Shares have added about 2% in that time frame.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is ADM due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Archer Daniels Q4 Earnings Top Estimates, Revenues LagArcher Daniels reported mixed fourth-quarter 2017 results. The company’s fourth-quarter adjusted earnings of 82 cents per share increased 9.3% year over year and also outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 70 cents. On a reported basis, Archer Daniels’ earnings were $1.39 per share compared with 73 cents in the prior-year quarter.However, total revenues of $16,070 million declined 2.6% year over year on lower sales across most of its segments. The top line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $16,350 million as well, thus continuing with its miserable surprise trend.Going by segments, quarterly revenues at Archer Daniels’ Agricultural Services segment were down 6.8% year over year to $7,517 million, the Corn Processing segment’s revenues dipped 0.3% to $2,509 million and the Wild Flavors and Specialty Ingredients segment’s revenues fell 3.3% to $526 million. Conversely, the Oilseeds Processing segment's revenues grew 2.7% to $5,424 million, while revenues at the Other division remained flat at $94 million.Operational DiscussionArcher Daniels reported adjusted segment operating profit of $793 million in fourth-quarter 2017, down 4.1% from the year-ago quarter. On a GAAP basis, the company’s segment operating profit declined 9.1% year over year to $733 million.On a segmental adjusted basis, adjusted operating profit for the Agricultural Services segment climbed 22.9% to $301 million owing to robust merchandising and handling results. The improvement was also fueled by sturdy performance in Global Trade, solid destination marketing gains as well as insurance and other income, which somewhat compensated the lack of competitiveness of U.S. grain exports. While, Milling and Other operations were weak due to reduced volumes and soft margins, Transportation results were impacted by diminished barge loadings as well as freight values.Archer Daniels' Corn Processing segment’s adjusted operating profit improved 2.4% to $261 million. Results benefited from enhanced results at both North America, and EMEA Sweeteners and Starches. However, Bioproducts results were hurt by soft ethanol margins partly offset by favorable risk management.The Oilseeds Processing segment’s adjusted operating profit decreased 15.5% year over year to $202 million. In spite of robust crush volumes and persistent growth in demand, results were hurt by soft crush margins as well as lower South American origination margins. Together, these factors hampered Crushing and Origination results. Additionally, soft biodiesel results hurt Refining, Packaging, Biodiesel and Other operations. However, the decline was somewhat mitigated by sturdy refining and packaging results. Further, results in Asia continued to gain from Wilmar’s contributions.The Wild Flavors and Specialty Ingredients segment’s adjusted operating profit surged 47.4% to $56 million owing to double-digit rise in WILD Flavors’ operating profit driven by soli sales in all regions. Also, the results at the Specialty Ingredients division witnessed a year-over-year growth.FinancialsArcher Daniels ended the quarter with $804 million in cash and cash equivalents. As of Dec 31, 2017, long-term debt including current maturities was $6,636 million. Shareholders’ equity at quarter end was $18,322 million.In 2017, Archer Daniels generated $2,211 million of cash from operating activities. Further, the company’s trailing four-quarter average adjusted ROIC came in at 6.4%.Additionally, the company returned $1.5 billion to shareholders in 2017, in the form of share repurchases and dividend payments, remaining well on track with its balanced capital allocation plan.Concurrent to this earnings release, management has declared a dividend hike of 4.7% to 33.5 cents per share compared with prior payout of 32 cents. The new dividend is payable on Mar 13, 2018, to shareholders of record as on Feb 20.Looking AheadManagement remains pleased with its results, supported by cost and capital initiatives, earnings per share growth and increased returns. Going into 2018, Archer Daniels remains encouraged to deliver growth through its strategic initiatives like increasing capabilities, product innovations, maximizing shareholders’ value and solid international foothold.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in fresh estimates. There have been two revisions higher for the current quarter compared to one lower.Archer Daniels Midland Company Price and Consensus  Archer Daniels Midland Company Price and Consensus | Archer Daniels Midland Company QuoteVGM ScoresAt this time, ADM has a subpar Growth Score of D, however its Momentum is doing a lot better with a B.

322,ADM,"Archer Daniels Midland Company (ADM  -  Free Report) has been gaining from strategic initiatives like management of business portfolio, Project Readiness, focus on cost-savings program and a disciplined capital allocation strategy. Recently, it reported solid fourth-quarter 2017 earnings wherein the bottom line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate and improved year over year.However, these initiatives were not enough to reverse the company’s dismal sales trend that has been lagging estimates for more than three years now. Moreover, fourth quarter sales also declined year over year due to soft sales across most segments. The drab performance history can be attributed to the fluctuating commodity prices, oversupply in the industry and unfavorable margins. This, in turn, has weighed upon the company’s share price movement. The stock has lost 5.6% in a year, narrower than the industry’s decline of 8.8%. Post fourth-quarter earnings, the stock gained 1.7% fueled by robust earnings. Additionally, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.76 for 2018 and $2.88 for 2019 has moved up by 5 cents and 8 cents, respectively, in the last seven days.Going into 2018, Archer Daniels remains encouraged on delivering growth through its strategic initiatives like increasing capabilities, product innovations, maximizing shareholders’ value and solid international foothold. Let’s see whether these initiatives are enough to cushion this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock and reverse the dismal sales trend.Deeper Insight of Strategic InitiativesArcher Daniels has been undertaking several strategic initiatives to manage its business portfolio. These initiatives are expected to help the company realize value and invest the same in the best possible resources to enhance returns. Further, to streamline its portfolio, the company has undertaken few divestitures as evident from the recent agreement to sell its oilseeds operations in Bolivia to Inversiones Piuranas S.A.Additionally, the company is progressing well with cost savings, a key component of its long-term strategy. Archer Daniels targets $550 million in additional run rate cost savings over the next five years, including cost savings of $350 million from operational excellence and process enhancements, and about $200 million in incremental purchasing savings. Impressively, the company has generated run-rate cost savings of $285 million in 2017 and plans to achieve $200 million in run-rate savings by the end of 2018.Moreover, Archer Daniels has long been enhancing operational efficiency at its production and supply chain networks to curtail costs. Also, the company is on track with business transformation, under its 1ADM program. Together, these aforementioned initiatives come under the company’s single strategic plan called Project Readiness. Management expects this project to drive business improvement, standardize functions and enrich consumers’ experience. Notably, it rolled out its 1ADM business transformation project in various regions as well as businesses in 2017 and remains on track with further 1ADM rollouts in 2018.Archer Daniels has also maintained a disciplined capital allocation strategy, focused on making investments to develop its business while using the excess cash to enhance shareholder returns through dividend payouts and share buybacks.

The improvement was also fueled by sturdy performance in Global Trade, solid destination marketing gains as well as insurance and other income, which somewhat compensated the lack of competitiveness of U.S. grain exports.

326,ADM,"Archer Daniels Midland Company (ADM  -  Free Report) is slated to release fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 6. The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether this food processing behemoth will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported.The company posted a negative earnings surprise of 18.2% in the last reported quarter. Moreover, it has lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters. Consequently, the company has reported average negative surprise of 4.1% in the trailing four quarters.Additionally, the company has posted negative earnings surprise in eight of the last 10 quarters. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Archer-Daniels-Midland Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Archer-Daniels-Midland Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Archer-Daniels-Midland Company QuoteWhat to Expect?The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at 70 cents, reflecting year-over-year decline of about 6.7%. Further, we note that earnings estimate for the quarter has declined by 1 cent in the last 30 days. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $16.4 billion, down 0.9% from the year-ago quarter.Furthermore, the company has a negative sales surprise history having lagged estimates for over three years now. This led Archer Daniels to underperform the broader Consumer Staples sector in the past year. The company’s shares dipped 2.6%, while the sector ascended 12.8%. The company’s dismal top-line performance makes us slightly skeptical about its upcoming results.Factors at PlayArcher Daniels has a dismal sales surprise trend due to lower sales at all segments. This drab performance history can be attributed to the fluctuating commodity prices, oversupply in the industry and unfavorable margins. In the most recent third-quarter 2017, earnings were hurt by a tough operating environment at the company’s Agricultural services and Oilseeds Processing segments, while sales declined across all segments.Additionally, the company’s margins remain under pressure due to soft operating performance at the Agricultural Services and Oilseeds Processing segments. Margins at Agricultural Services segment were hurt by soft merchandising and handling results for North America Grain due to lack of competitiveness of U.S. corn and soybeans in global markets. Further, lower crushing margins as well as lower South American origination margins resulted in reduced margins at Oilseeds Processing segment. Based on the dismal third-quarter performance and negative surprise trend, we remain apprehensive about the company’s future performance.However, Archer Daniels remains committed to strengthening capacities and geographic spread, through buyouts and other organic expansions. These factors and the prospects from Project Readiness, position it to deliver solid bottom-line growth in 2017. Moreover, the company’s transition from a period of costs and investments in acquisitions, new innovation centers and facilities, to focusing on reducing capital spending and increasing benefits from investments, is likely to aid results.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Archer Daniels is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Archer Daniels currently has an Earnings ESP of +2.14%, as the Most Accurate estimate of 72 cents is pegged higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 70 cents. However, it carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). The combination of Archer Daniels’ Zacks Rank #4 and Earnings ESP of 2.14% makes surprise prediction difficult.Stocks with Favorable CombinationHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:United Natural Foods, Inc. (UNFI  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +5.67% and a Zacks Rank #2.

333,ADM,"Benchmarks ended in the red on Monday following reports from Bloomberg that the House was considering a ‘gradual phasing-in’ of corporate tax rates. This hurt investor sentiment and caused broad based losses for the markets. Market watchers also awaited the announcement of the next Fed Chief, whose name President Trump is expected to reveal on Thursday. Meanwhile, markets also suffered after Paul Manafort was convicted in the Russian meddling case.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) closed at 23,348.74, losing 0.4%. The S&P 500 Index (INX) decreased 0.3% to close at 2,572.83. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite Index (IXIC) closed at 6,701.26, decreasing 0.03%. Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1,469 to 1,308. On the Nasdaq, decliners outnumbered advancers by 1,625 to 1,049. The CBOE VIX increased 4.6% to close at 10.25.Benchmarks Post LossesThe Dow declined 85.5 points to end the session with losses. The blue-chip index was weighed down by a decline in the shares of Merck & Co. (MRK  -  Free Report) and Verizon Communications (VZ  -  Free Report), shares of which declined 6.1% and 2.1%, respectively. Merck suffered its biggest two-day decline following reports that it had withdrawn its application seeking approval for the usage of its cancer immunotherapy drug in Europe.Of the 11 major sectors of the S&P 500, seven ended in the red, with healthcare stocks leading the decliners. The Health Care Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLV) dipped 1.1% on Monday, posting its worst one-day dip since Aug 17. Moreover, a decline in the shares of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

This would effectively reduce the current rate of corporate tax — at 35% — to 20% by 2022. However, House Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady commented that the procedure is still under review and there has not been any formal decision on it.The guidelines of the proposal state that tax rates would be slashed by three percentage points each year, beginning in 2018. The economists have clearly stated that if such a framework is adopted it would not only become less effective but would also delay any economic effects that President Trump and his aides aim to achieve. However, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, in a press meeting, commented that Trump wants to immediately slash the tax rates.Such news led to losses for the Russell 2000 index which declined 1.2% to post its worst single-day decline since Aug 17.Investor sentiment was also hurt after Trump’s former campaign manager Paul Manafort was charged with conspiracy against the United States for an alleged Russian meddling in 2016 Presidential elections. Meanwhile, investors also eagerly wait to know as to whom Trump would choose as the next Fed Chief. Trump is expected to announce his decision on Thursday.Economic DataOn the economic data front, personal income for the month of September increased 0.4%, up from 0.2% in August. The consensus estimate for the period was also 0.4%. On the other hand, the consumer spending surged 1%, more than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 0.8%. This marks its highest level in almost 8 years. Such a rally can be attributed to the fact that the residents of hurricane ravaged Texas and Florida replaced their flood-damaged automobiles. Economists believe that this would have only a short term effect on consumer spending. Meanwhile, the Core PCE inflation for September increased 0.1%, in line with the consensus estimate.Stocks That Made HeadlinesUnder Armour Q3 Earnings Top, Stock Tanks on View CutUnder Armour, Inc. (UAA  -  Free Report) reported mixed quarterly numbers in third-quarter 2017, wherein earnings came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate but revenues lagged the same.

334,ADM,"Archer Daniels Midland Company (ADM  -  Free Report) reported a dismal third-quarter 2017, wherein both the top and bottom lines lagged estimates and declined year over year. Results were hurt by a tough operating environment at the company’s Agricultural services and Oilseeds Processing segments.With this, the company has posted a negative earnings surprise in three of the trailing four quarters. Additionally, its more than three-year long trend of missing sales estimates persisted.Following the dismal results the company’s shares dropped nearly 2.1% in the pre-market trading session. Moreover, Archer Daniels has underperformed the Consumer Staples sector on a year-to-date basis due to its negative surprise history. Evidently, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has declined 6.2% against the sector’s growth of 7.1%.Q3 HighlightsThe company’s third-quarter adjusted earnings of 45 cents per share declined 27.3% year over year, and also lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 55 cents.Archer-Daniels-Midland Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Archer-Daniels-Midland Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Archer-Daniels-Midland Company QuoteOn a reported basis, Archer Daniels’ earnings were 34 cents per share compared with 58 cents in the prior-year quarter.Total revenues of $14,827 million dropped 6.3% year over year, with lower year-over-year sales at all segments.

On a GAAP basis, the company’s segment operating profit declined 24.8% year over year to $485 million.On a segmental adjusted basis, adjusted operating profit for the Agricultural Services segment declined 55.4% to $87 million, due to soft merchandising and handling results for both North America Grain and Global Trade, stemming from lack of competitiveness of U.S. corn and soybeans in global markets. Milling and Other operations were weak as well due to lower volumes, while product margins remained strong. Transportation results were impacted by diminished U.S. grain exports and slow start to North American harvest.Archer Daniels' Corn Processing segment’s adjusted operating profit improved 18.2% to $253 million. Results benefited from enhanced margins at North America Sweeteners and Starches. Further, favorable ethanol margins drove Bioproducts results.The Oilseeds Processing segment’s adjusted operating profit decreased 17.9% year over year to $119 million. Results were hurt by reduced global crush margins as well as lower South American origination margins. Together, these factors hampered Crushing and origination results. Additionally, soft biodiesel results due to lower margins and negative mark-to-market impacts, hurt Refining, Packaging, Biodiesel and Other operations results. However, results in Asia continued to gain from Wilmar’s contributions.The Wild Flavors and Specialty Ingredients segment’s adjusted operating profit dropped 16.4% to $61 million owing to hurdles in the specialty ingredients business. This was partly offset by double-digit rise in WILD Flavors’ operating profit driven by strong sales in Asia and EMEA.FinancialsArcher Daniels ended the quarter with $518 million in cash and cash equivalents. As of Sep 30, 2017, long-term debt including current maturities was $6,608 million.

336,ADM,"We are almost halfway through the third-quarter earnings season, which portrays a pretty favorable picture. Of the notable factors influencing this season are rising momentum on the revenue front is noteworthy.Further, the above-average proportion of positive earnings surprises has been maintained in the quarter and the estimate revision trend for the December quarter is also favorable. Additionally, the overall third-quarter earnings for the S&P 500 index remains on track to reach a new all-time quarterly record by beating the previous earnings season’s record.Per the Earnings Preview dated Oct 27, nearly 272 S&P 500 members have already reported their results. Of these, approximately 75.7% delivered positive earnings surprises, while 66.2% beat top-line expectations. Notably, earnings for these companies have advanced 8.7% from the same period last year, with revenues up 6.7%.For the third quarter as a whole, total earnings for the S&P 500 index are projected to improve 5.4% year over year on 5.5% growth in revenues.A Look at Consumer Staples SectorAgriculture and food stocks form part of the Consumer Staples sector. Markedly, the sector is on growth trajectory since the start of the current year, supported by buoyant economy and improving consumer confidence despite a competitive landscape and geopolitical turmoil.In fact, we note that the performance of the index depends upon all 16 Zacks sectors, out of which nine sectors are expected to witness an earnings decline in the third quarter. However, the Consumer Staples sector is likely to witness 2.6% and 1.9% growth in earnings and revenues, respectively. Also, a Zacks Sector Rank of #6 (out of 16), places the sector at the top 38% of the Zacks classified sectors. Evidently, the sector has gained 7.9% year to date, lower than the S&P 500’s growth of 15.4%.  Our research shows that when a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) stock is combined with a positive Earnings ESP, the chance of beating earnings estimates is high. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter .That said, let’s see what awaits the couple of stocks that are slated to report third-quarter 2017 earnings on Oct 31.Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (ADM  -  Free Report) expects exports from Argentine to continue to affect margins at the Oilseeds segment in the third quarter, when the global environment is anticipated to remain highly competitive. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for operating profit in the Oilseeds Processing segment is pegged at $210 million.Also, the overall Agricultural Services results are anticipated to be down in the quarter in comparison to the last year. Further, the fluctuating commodity prices, oversupply in the industry and unfavorable margins have also been denting its overall results.Archer-Daniels-Midland Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Archer-Daniels-Midland Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Archer-Daniels-Midland Company QuoteOur proven model does not conclusively show that Archer Daniels is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter as the company has an Earnings ESP of -3.39%. Though the company’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of earnings, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident of a beat.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Further, revenues are expected to be $15.6 billion for the quarter, down 1.3% from the year-ago period. This means that the company’s more than three-year long dismal revenue surprise is likely to continue in the to-be reported quarter as well.Nevertheless, the company is ahead of track with its 2017 run-rate savings goal of $225 million. Therefore, management remains confident of achieving strong year-over-year earnings growth in 2017. (Read: Will Oilseeds Segment Hurt Archer Daniels Q3 Earnings?)Kellogg Company (K  -  Free Report) is the leading manufacturer and marketer of ready-to-eat cereals and convenience foods, and savory snacks. It has been witnessing decline in revenues for the last two years primarily due to lower demand. In particular, weak performance by its cereal products in developed markets as well as soft U.S. snacks business have been negatively impacting the company’s performances. Additionally, the company has been struggling due to the shift in consumer preference toward natural and organic ingredients over packaged and processed food.Nevertheless, given the tepid sales growth, Kellogg is making aggressive efforts toward improving its food offerings. In sync with this, the company is investing in brand building, in-store capabilities along with product and packaging innovation. In the second half of 2017, its sales are expected to somewhat benefit from innovation and Pringles’ improved performance in Europe.

337,ADM,"Archer Daniels Midland Company (ADM  -  Free Report) is slated to release third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 31. The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether this food processing behemoth will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported.The company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 9.6% in the last reported quarter and has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters. Consequently, the company has delivered a trailing four-quarter average beat of 6.8%. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Archer-Daniels-Midland Company Price and EPS Surprise Archer-Daniels-Midland Company Price and EPS Surprise | Archer-Daniels-Midland Company QuoteWhat to Expect?The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at 55 cents, reflecting year-over-year decline of about 7%. Further, we note that earnings estimate for the quarter has declined by 1 cent in the last seven days, following an 8 cents decline in the last 30 days. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $15.6 billion, down 1.3% from the year-ago quarter.Furthermore, the company has a negative sales surprise history having lagged estimates for over three years now. This led Archer Daniels to underperform the broader Consumer Staples sector year to date. The company’s shares dipped 5.6%, while the sector escalated 8%. The company’s dismal top-line performance makes us slightly skeptical about its upcoming results.Factors at PlayArcher Daniels’ murky sales surprise trend due to lower sales at all segments has been a woe. This drab performance history can be attributed to the fluctuating commodity prices, oversupply in the industry and unfavorable margins. Additionally, management expects exports from Argentine to continue to press margins at the Oilseeds segment in the third quarter, when the global environment is anticipated to remain highly competitive. Also, we remain worried about Harvey's impact on the Archer Daniels' performance. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for operating profit in the Oilseeds Processing segment stands at $210 million.Looking ahead, Archer Daniels remains committed to strengthen its capacities and geographic spread, through buyouts and other organic expansions. The company also remains focused on efficient cost and capital management. These factors drove the company’s first-half results, enabling it to return value to shareholders.Notably, the company is ahead of track with its 2017 run-rate savings goal of $225 million. All said, management remains confident of achieving strong year-over-year earnings growth in 2017. Further, it is believed that the company is poised to emerge stronger in 2018. However, the aforementioned obstacles make us anxious about Archer Daniels’ upcoming results.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Archer Daniels is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Archer Daniels currently carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company’s Earnings ESP of -3.39%, as the Most Accurate estimate of 53 cents is pegged below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 55 cents.

338,ADM,"Leading food processing company, Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (ADM  -  Free Report) remains focused on strengthening its business through increased cost savings, a key component of its long-term strategy. However, the company’s murky sales surprise history due to lower sales at all segments remains a woe.Growth DriversCost-Savings PlanWe note that Archer Daniels’ cost-savings initiatives remain well on track. In fact, the company is running ahead of schedule with its savings target of $225 million for 2017. Management targets $550 million in additional run rate cost savings over the next five years that includes cost savings of $350 million from operational excellence and process enhancements, and about $200 million in incremental purchasing savings.Driven by its strategic initiatives like making meaningful acquisitions, undertaking organic growth projects and efficiently managing portfolio, the company generated run-rate savings of nearly $130 million in the first half of 2017. Additionally, Archer Daniels remains focused on cost synergy activities by addressing redundancies and removing overlapping corporate SG&A.Project Readiness Bodes WellNotably, Archer Daniels has long been enhancing its operational efficiency at its production and supply chain networks in order to curtail costs. Further, the company has been on track with its business transformation, under its 1ADM program.Also, management announced plans to converge both the aforementioned activities into a single strategic plan called Project Readiness, in 2017. Going forward, the company anticipates this project to help management have a more coordinated approach toward driving business improvement, standardizing functions and enriching consumers’ experience. In fact, as a part of this plan, Archer Daniels intends to allocate resources efficiently on more mature businesses, thus making a prudent business investment.Other StrengthsArcher Daniels has been undertaking several strategic initiatives to manage its business portfolio.

In sync with this, it shifted from domestic projects – where returns are difficult to model – to international projects that can be tracked more easily and will be accretive at a faster pace.Markedly, Archer Daniels, which shares space with Limoneira Company (LMNR  -  Free Report), Calyxt, Inc. (CLXT  -  Free Report) and Calavo Growers, Inc. (CVGW  -  Free Report), has always maintained a disciplined capital allocation strategy. This reflects the company’s prudent investments to develop its business, while using the excess cash to enhance shareholder returns through dividend payouts and share buybacks.Concerns/HeadwindsThough Archer Daniels’ actions bode well, it has a dismal sales surprise history as the top line has lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate for over three years now. Furthermore, the company has delivered negative earnings surprise in seven of the last nine quarters. This drab performance history can be attributed to the fluctuating commodity prices, oversupply in the industry and unfavorable margins.Additionally, management expects exports from Argentine to continue pressing margins at the Oilseeds segment in the third quarter, when the global environment is expected to remain highly competitive. Also, we remain worried about Harvey's impact on the Archer Daniels' performance.4 Stocks to Watch after the Massive Equifax HackCybersecurity stocks spiked on recent news of a data breach affecting 143 million Americans.

339,ADM,"General Mills Inc. (GIS  -  Free Report) is set to report first-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Sep 20, before the market opens. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 2.82%.This branded consumer foods’ company delivered a positive earnings surprise in three of the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 0.86%.The chart below depicts the surprise history.General Mills, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  General Mills, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | General Mills, Inc. QuoteFactors to ConsiderAlthough General Mills is making efforts to drive revenue growth through consumer-focused innovations and marketing initiatives in its key businesses, the company is expected to witness muted sales growth in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. This is due to continued volume declines in North America.Sales and profits at the North America Retail segment, which accounted for about 65.3% of the company’s total sales in fiscal 2017, have been soft due to lower demand amid weak food industry trends and changing consumer preferences. Further, organically, year-over-year sales growth is anticipated to decline 1-2% in fiscal 2018.However, much like the other food companies, General Mills, too is focusing on cost-cutting initiatives to boost margin amid soft sales. During the last-reported quarter, despite soft sales, the company’s adjusted gross margin increased 70 basis points (bps) year over year to 35.1%, helped by cost-saving measures. Even its adjusted operating margin grew 220 bps to 16.8%, owing to higher adjusted gross margins, benefits from cost-savings initiatives, and a 17% decline in advertising and media expense.The company has plans of delivering approximately $390 million in supply chain productivity savings in fiscal 2018 through its ongoing Holistic Margin Management (HMM) efforts. General Mills also expects to deliver about $160 million in incremental savings from other restructuring and cost-reduction initiatives, which equates to approximately $700 million in aggregate cost savings by fiscal 2018.That said, an expected decline in volumes, primarily in North America, higher promotional expenses, as planned for the second half of fiscal 2018, and rising input costs are likely to remain a drag in the to-be-reported quarter.For the fiscal first quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 77 cents, reflecting a decline of 1.7% year over year. Meanwhile, our estimate for revenues is pegged at $3.79 billion, implying a 3% decline.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that General Mills is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. However, that is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: General Mills’ Earnings ESP is 0.00% as the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 77 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: General Mills’ Zacks Rank #2 increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise.Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few companies in the consumer staples sector that can be considered as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in their upcoming releases.Philip Morris International Inc. (PM  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.08% and a Zacks Rank #3.

340,ADM,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Archer Daniels Midland Company (ADM  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Archer Daniels has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 16.6, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 19.8. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, Archer Daniels’ current PE level puts it below its midpoint of 17.1 over the past five years. Moreover, the current level stands quite lower than the highs for the stock, suggesting that it could be a solid entry point.Further, the stock’s PE compares favorably with the Zacks Consumer Staples sector’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 25.1. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers. We should also point out that Archer Daniels’ forward PE is roughly same as its trailing twelve months value, so we might say that the forward earnings estimates are incorporated in the company’s share price as of now. We define forward PE as current price relative to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current fiscal year.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Archer Daniels has a P/S ratio of about 0.4. This is much lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.1 right now. Thus, the stock is undervalued from this aspect too.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Archer Daniels currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of A, putting it into the top 20% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes Archer Daniels a solid choice for value investors.What About the Stock Overall?Though Archer Daniels might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade and Momentum score of D, each. This gives ADM a Zacks VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of C. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been quite disappointing. The current quarter has seen three estimates go lower in the past sixty days compared to one upward revision, while the full year estimate has seen four downward and one upward revision in the same time period.This has had a negative impact on the consensus estimate, as the current quarter consensus estimate has dropped by 5.9% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has inched lower by 1.9%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:In light of these bearish trends, the stock has just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which is why we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineArcher Daniels is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Despite a Zacks Rank #3, the company has a solid Zacks Industry Rank (Top 32% out of over 250 Zacks industries) which hints at favorable broader factors.  So, value investors might want to wait for estimates to turn around in this name first, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick.Zacks' 10-Minute Stock-Picking SecretSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year. With compounding, rebalancing, and exclusive of fees, it can turn thousands into millions of dollars. But here's something even more remarkable: You can master this proven system without going to a single class or seminar.

344,ADM,"Archer Daniels Midland Company (ADM  -  Free Report) posted mixed results in second-quarter 2017, wherein the bottom line rose year over year and topped estimates after posting two quarters of negative earnings surprise. However, the company has been missing sales estimates for over three years now and disappointed this time too.Owing to these trends, Archer Daniels has underperformed the Consumer Staples sector on a year-to-date basis. Evidently, this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) stock has declined 7.6% against the sector’s growth of nearly 10%.Q2 HighlightsThe company’s second-quarter adjusted earnings of 57 cents per share soared about 39% year over year, and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 52 cents. Results were driven by the company’s focus on its strategic plan and efforts to exploit better conditions in some markets. On a reported basis, Archer Daniels’ earnings remained flat at 48 cents.Archer-Daniels-Midland Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Archer-Daniels-Midland Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Archer-Daniels-Midland Company QuoteTotal revenue of $14,943 million dropped 4.4% year over year, with lower year-over-year sales at all segments. Moreover, the top line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $15,842 million thus continuing with its miserable surprise trend.Going by segments, quarterly revenues at Archer Daniels’ Agricultural Services segment were down 8.4% to $5,848 million, the Corn Processing segment’s revenues fell 3.3% to $2,274 million and the Oilseeds Processing segment’s revenues dipped 0.4% to $6,072 million.  Further, the Wild Flavors and Specialty Ingredients segment suffered a 4.7% decline in revenues to $648 million and Other revenues fell 9% to $101 million, all on a year-over-year basis.Operational DiscussionArcher Daniels reported adjusted segment operating profit of $658 million in second-quarter 2017, up 14.8% from the year-ago quarter. On a GAAP basis, the company’s segment operating profit declined 5.6% year over year to $642 million.On a segmental adjusted basis, operating profit for the Agricultural Services segment surged a whopping 91.2% to $109 million, as strong merchandising and handling results were backed by solid North American performance, thanks to strength across wheat, corn and soybeans. Milling and Other operations remained robust too, backed by favorable margins and merchandising. This was partly offset by weakness in Transportation results.Archer Daniels' Corn Processing segment’s adjusted operating profit grew 37.4% to $224 million. Results benefited from strong volumes and enhanced margins at North America Sweeteners and Starches. Further, favorable ethanol margins drove Bioproducts results.The Oilseeds Processing segment’s adjusted operating profit decreased 12.3% year over year to $206 million. Results were hurt by reduced global soybean crush margins as well as lower South American origination margins. Together, these factors hampered Crushing and origination results. This, however, was somewhat compensated by improved Softseeds results and strong Refining, Packaging, Biodiesel and Other operations. Moreover, results in Asia continued to gain from Wilmar’s contributions.The Wild Flavors and Specialty Ingredients segment’s adjusted operating profit dipped 2.1% to $92 million owing to hurdles in the specialty ingredients business. This was partly offset by double-digit rise in WILD Flavors’ operating profit which was driven by superb worldwide sales.FinancialsArcher Daniels ended the quarter with $433 million in cash and cash equivalents. As of Jun 30, 2017, long-term debt including current maturities was $6,627 million. Shareholders’ equity at quarter end was $17,418 million.During first-half 2017, Archer Daniels generated $1,314 million of cash from operating activities.Further, the company’s trailing four-quarter average adjusted ROIC came in at 6.8%, up 80 basis points (bps) from the annual WACC of 6.0%.Additionally, the company returned $875 million to shareholders in first-half 2017, in the form of share repurchases and dividend payments, remaining well on track with its balanced capital allocation plan.Looking AheadArcher Daniels remains committed to strengthen its capacities and geographic spread, via buyouts and other organic expansions. The company also remains focused on efficient cost and capital management. Well, these factors drove the company’s first-half results, enabling it to return value to shareholders. Notably, management stated that the company is ahead of track with its 2017 run-rate savings goal of $225 million. All said, management remains confident of achieving strong year-over-year earnings growth in 2017. Further, it is believed that the company is poised to emerge stronger in 2018.Interested in Consumer Staples Space? Check these 3 Hot PicksPost Holdings, Inc.

346,ADM,"Archer Daniels Midland Company (ADM  -  Free Report) is slated to release second-quarter 2017 results on Aug 1. The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether this food processing behemoth will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. The company delivered a negative earnings surprise in the last reported quarter and has underperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three out of the past four trailing quarters. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement. Archer-Daniels-Midland Company Price and EPS Surprise   Archer-Daniels-Midland Company Price and EPS Surprise | Archer-Daniels-Midland Company QuoteWhat to Expect?The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at 54 cents, reflecting year-over-year increase of about 32%. However, we note that our earnings estimate has declined by 4 cents over the last seven days. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $15.8 billion, up a little over 1% from the year-ago quarter.Archer Daniels forms part of the Consumer Staples sector. Per the latest Earnings Trends, the sector’s earnings are expected to rise 3.1%, while revenues are expected to climb 1.2%.Factors at PlayArcher Daniels has tumbled 9.3% so far this year, as against the sector’s growth of 10%. Well, this could be largely accountable to the company’s dismal sales surprise history. Evidently, Archer Daniels has been missing sales estimates for over three years now. In fact, the company's bottom line has not been impressive too, as the last reported quarter marked its second straight earnings miss. The murky performance can be mainly attributed to fluctuating commodity prices, oversupply in the industry and unfavorable margins.Further, management expects the global landscape in the second half of 2017 to be competitive for the Agricultural Services segment. Also, results at the Oilseeds segment are anticipated to be in a range of flat to down year over year. The company expects soybean crush margins to remain pressurized on account of excess supply and competition. While export volumes in Brazil are expected to improve, margins are likely to be dented by sluggish commercialization. On the other hand, results at the Corn Processing and Wild Flavors and Specialty Ingredients segments are expected to show better results in the second quarter, as compared with the last year. However, the aforementioned obstacles make us anxious about Archer Daniels’ upcoming results.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Archer Daniels is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESPand a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Archer Daniels has an Earnings ESP of -1.85% as the Most Accurate estimate of 53 cents is below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 54 cents. Further, the company currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Note that we caution against Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions. The combination of Archer Daniels’ dismal Zacks Rank and negative Earnings ESP makes us apprehensive about the stock.Stocks with Favorable CombinationHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Dollar General Corporation (DG  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.94% and a Zacks Rank #2.

347,ADM,"It is amazing to see how fast the markets have started to look past the Debt Deal even as it has yet to become to the law of the land. We will likely get the President's signature on the bill after the Senate passes it later today; the House passed it Monday evening. 
"
348,ADM,"With default no longer a concern but a rating downgrade that may still be in the cards, stocks have moved on to fretting about the growth question. And there are plenty of reasons for investors to keep an eye on the U.S. economy's growth outlook. 
"
349,ADM,"The market was looking for a rebound in economic growth in the back half of the year after the first half fell victim to what appeared to be temporary factors such as high gasoline prices, theJapan disaster and unusual weather. Friday's GDP report showed us that growth in the first half of the year was even weaker than what we thought we had. 
"
350,ADM,"This meant that the U.S. economy has entered the second half of the year with a lot less momentum than all of us had expected. Add to this the weak July ISM Manufacturing report from Monday, and we have a less than reassuring start to the third quarter. 
"
351,ADM,"Will GDP growth expectations for the third quarter, which currently remain above 3%, come down in the coming days or we will start seeing evidence of above-trend growth in the days to come? It is hard to answer that question with any level of certainty at this stage. The July non-farm payroll numbers coming out this Friday may help a little in answering it. But my feeling is that we may have to wait a bit longer than that.
"
352,ADM,"In contrast to the erratic behavior of the economic recovery since the end of the Great Recession in the summer of 2009, the corporate earnings recovery has been a standout performer. We are still going through the second-quarter reporting season, but I have no hesitation in saying that earnings reports in the first half of the year have been signficantly better than what the underlying economy has done. Given this track record, it may not be unreasonable to extrapoloate this performance to the back half of the year. 
"
353,ADM,"We are more than two-thirds done with the second quarter earnings reports, but we had results from a handful of important companies this morning.

355,ADM,"Avon Products, Inc. (AVP  -  Free Report) is out of investors’ good books for a while now as the company is grappling with weak Representatives growth for the last few quarters. In fact, this has largely impacted the company’s top line, which lagged estimates in five of the trailing seven quarters. The company has also missed earnings estimates in eight of the last 11 quarters.Dismal surprise history largely weighed on this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company’s price performance. In the past three months, the stock has plunged 44.7%, wider than the industry’s 7.4% decline.Reasons Behind the Dismal PerformanceAvon has been witnessing sluggish Active and Ending Representatives for quite a while now. In first-quarter 2018, Active Representatives decreased year over year in all of the company's four segments, while Ending Representatives fell in all the segments except Europe, Middle East & Africa.Furthermore, the top line was impacted by decline in Active Representatives, mainly in Brazil and Mexico, coupled with challenges in key markets, particularly in Brazil. In fact, management still expects intense competitive environment in Brazil to adversely impact pricing despite the developing economy.We note that Active Representatives fell 2%, 3% and 3% in the fourth, third and second quarters of 2017. Although Ending Representatives remained flat in the fourth quarter, it declined 2% in both the third and second quarters of 2017.In addition, gross margin contracted 280 basis points (bps) in first-quarter 2018 due to higher supply-chain costs. Notably, gross margin included a 310 bps negative impact from the adoption of the new revenue standard.As Avon is a cosmetics retailer and operates in a consumer centric market, it has to resonate well with changes in consumer preferences and spending patterns for beauty products. Failure in predicting consumer preferences might result in loss of market share and profitability. Additionally, material shifts in market demand for a product for any reason may result in increased inventory levels, which might lead to selling goods at lower prices. This, in turn, is likely to ultimately hurt the company’s top and bottom line.Avon too faces competition from various products and product lines in both domestic and international markets.Is Transformation Plan a Boon?Avon’s continued progress on Transformation Plan is noteworthy. The plan mainly focuses on investing for growth, enhancing cost structure and improving financial flexibility. In this regard, the company has witnessed significant progress compared with its targets of enhancing cost structure and improving financial resilience. Notably, the company has completed the second year of its three-year Transformation Plan, which surpassed the cost-saving target of $230 million, realizing above $250 million in 2017.In 2018, Avon remains on track to achieve cost savings of $65 million, with roughly $15 million generated in the first quarter. Also, management intends to focus on the business foundations and improve overall performance to attain its savings target. The company anticipates achieving the long-term target of delivering the mid-single-digit constant-dollar revenue growth and low double-digit operating margin.Additionally, management is committed toward boosting Representatives growth by providing deeper insights and analytics into Representative’s behavior, and requirements to boost experience. Avon also remains encouraged to minimize service disruption along with pilot programs that cover service from end to end.However, it remains to be seen whether the company’s Transformation Plan and Representatives growth strategies can offset the aforementioned headwinds and reverse stock performance.Better-Ranked Consumer Staples StocksMedifast, Inc.

356,ADM,"The agriculture industry has been experiencing growth since mid-February 2018. There is adequate optimism for the industry through 2018 as the USDA projects agricultural exports of $142.5 billion for 2018, up $3 million from the February forecast, mainly due to a rise in corn and cotton exports. Further, the USDA expects soybean exports to increase on higher demand for soybean meal and oil and lower competition from Argentina.Moreover, the industry is riding high on the benefits of the organic movement, where agriculturists are adapting to organic production techniques to satisfy consumers’ increasing demand for healthier foods and ingredients. Further, innovations in food processing, improved grain handling techniques, larger storage spaces, diversification and strong emerging market demand are conducive to the industry.However, the rising rift in trade relations with China may pose a barrier to the growth of the U.S. agricultural segment. Adversities arising from China’s retaliatory tariffs on American agricultural products like soybeans, corn, pork and poultry, is turning to be a major concern for the U.S. farming segment. Among these, soybean is likely to be impacted the most as China is the largest importer.Recent data reveals a sharp decline in China’s purchases of American soybeans due for delivery later on in 2018, in anticipation of higher tariffs. Further, China may turn to Brazil and Argentina, the world’s second and third largest soybean producers, respectively, to cover the shortfall in soybeans supplies.Notwithstanding these headwinds, players in the U.S. agri-business are poised to gain from their efforts to adopt organic production methods, with reduced use of chemicals and pesticides to grow crops. On the whole, the shift in consumers’ preference to healthier food options, including lower consumption of meat, is likely to result in higher demand for agri-based products.Additionally, companies are undertaking measures to lower operating costs and improve efficiency with the use of modern technology and equipment.Industry Performance Edges Over S&P 500The U.S.-China trade conflict is likely to leave a meaningful impact on the performance of the American agriculture space. However, pronounced effects of tariffs on American agriculture products are expected show up near the end of 2018 due to the advance purchase agreements for soybeans and other products. Moreover, the stocks in the industry are getting much support from strategies to shift to healthier food options, an expanding animal feed business, innovation, cost curtailment and more.The Zacks Agriculture – Operations Industry within the broader Zacks Consumer Staples Sector has outperformed both the S&P 500 and its own sector year to date.While the stocks in this industry have collectively gained 8.9%, the Zacks S&P 500 Composite has rallied 4.3% and Zacks Consumer Staples Sector declined 9.6%.Year-to-Date Price Performance However, it’s worth noting that there was a significant lack of synchronization in the performance of individual stocks within the group. While some agricultural stocks are suffering from strained margins due to increased costs to catch up with the changing industry trends, others with solid financial backing and effective execution of strategic plans are outperforming.Agriculture Stocks Trading CheapOne might get a good sense of the industry’s relative valuation by looking at its price-to-earnings ratio (P/E), which is the most appropriate multiple for valuing Consumer Staples stocks because their earnings are effective in gauging performance. The industry's valuation picture looks attractive.    This ratio essentially measures a stock’s current market value relative to its earnings performance. Investors believe that the lower the P/E, the higher the value of the stock will be.Generally, the price of a stock rallies on a rise in earnings. As earnings forecasts move higher, demand for the stock should drive its price. If the P/E of a stock is rising steadily, it means that investors are pinning their hopes on the company’s inherent strength.The industry currently has a trailing 12-month P/E ratio of 16.8X, which is in sync with the median level over the past year and below the one-year median level of 19.4X. The space also attractive when compared with the market at large, as the trailing 12-month P/E ratio for the S&P 500 is 20.5X and the median over the past year is 20.3.Price-to-Earnings Ratio (TTM)Outperformance May Continue on Solid Earnings OutlookDespite the threat of adverse consequences from the trade war, the agriculture operations segment has been displaying strength due to the adoption of latest technology and techniques, a shift to organic and healthier options, research & development, better grain handling and storage, diversification, effective cost control and strong emerging market demand. These factors are likely to help the stocks in the industry to generate positive shareholder returns in the near future.But what really matters to investors is whether this group has the potential to perform better than the broader market in the quarters ahead. The above ratio analysis shows that there is a solid value-oriented path ahead. However, one should look for good entry points based on solid fundamentals and other near-term factors.One reliable measure that can help investors understand the industry’s prospects for a solid price performance is the earnings outlook for its member companies. Empirical research shows that a company’s earnings outlook significantly influences the performance of its stock.One could get a good sense of a company’s earnings outlook by comparing the consensus earnings expectation for the current financial year with the last year’s reported number, but an effective measure could be the magnitude and direction of the recent change in earnings estimates.The consensus earnings estimate for the Zacks Agriculture – Operations industry is reflecting an improvement since February 2018. Moreover, the trend in earnings estimate revisions depicts a positive graph.Price and Consensus: Zacks Agriculture – Operations Industry Looking at the aggregate estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are hopeful of this group’s earnings potential.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates continued outperformance in the near term.The Zacks Agriculture – Operations industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #108, which places it at the top 42% of more than 250 Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Our proprietary Heat Map shows that the industry’s rank has improved considerably over the past eight weeks. Agriculture – Operations: Earnings & Revenue TrendsThe past earnings trend of the Agriculture – Operations space reveals that although the group has witnessed a steep in decline in the period between 2014 and 2016, there is an uptrend thereafter.Agriculture – Operations EPS Though the Zacks Agriculture – Operations industry has witnessed steep decline in revenues historically, we note that top lines have stabilized since March 2017.Agriculture – Operations Revenues Bottom LineU.S. farmers and food processors are in the crossroads of a global trade conflict. Tariffs were already imposed by Canada on beef and by Mexico on pork and ham imports. Another round of tariff from China on soybeans and pork has also shored in response to Trump’s latest tariff implementation. The consequences of the trade-war are likely to be devastating, not only for these economies but for the entire world.However, the agricultural segment should remain resilient given the increased demand for food stemming from the drastic rise in global population and the changing dietary preferences of people around the globe, particularly in emerging markets. Estimates reveal that global demand for food is expected to rise by 70% by 2050. Further, a stable economic backdrop with a tightened job market and rising income present a favorable scenario for the growth of this consumer-driven industry.Though the industry’s valuations are cheap for the one-year horizon (as discussed above), the solid run by the stocks in the last few months might have made some stocks pricey. So, it is appropriate that investors closely evaluate the long-term expectations and look for some good entry points in the stocks that will help them to make the most of the momentum in the industry.While none of the stocks in our Agriculture – Operations industry currently sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), there are two stocks that carry Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

360,ADM,"After months of rhetorical tariff threats between Washington and Beijing, the world’s two largest economies have declared a trade war. This is especially true as Trump’s 25% tariff on $34 billion in Chinese goods, including auto, electric cars, aerospace, communications tech, new materials and robotics became reality at 12:01 A.M. on Jul 6 and another $16 billion is expected to go into effect in two weeks.China also hit back with the same scale and strength, slapping charges on American goods targeting heartland staples like soybeans, corn, pork and poultry. The United States has violated World Trade Organization rules and ignited the largest trade war in economic history,” China’s Commerce Ministry said in a statement. With retaliation from Beijing, Trump has issued warnings of additional tariffs on $500 billion in Chinese goods.The latest move marked the escalation of the trade war from threat to reality and would result in a global recession. It would hurt global supply chains, increase costs for businesses and consumers and slow down investments. Canada, Mexico and Europe are also engaged in tit-for-tat tariff exchange with the United States. As a result, the ongoing development suggests that the worst, which could send shockwaves across stock markets, is yet to come.Against such a backdrop, there are a few places where investors can stash their cash in the stock world and a few that should be avoided.Best ZonesGoldIn difficult market environments, gold is considered a great store of value and hedge against market turmoil. Acting as a leveraged play on the underlying metal prices, metal miners tend to experience more gains than their bullion cousins in a rising metal market. Hence, mining stocks could outperform in the current trade turmoil. As such, Yamana Gold Inc. (AUY) seems a lucrative pick as it carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and a Momentum Score of A. The stock has risen 8.1% over the past month.Consumer StaplesThe consumer staples sector is defensive as it includes a variety of items like food & beverages, non-durable household goods, hypermarkets and consumer supercenters that are every-day essentials. These products see steady demand even during an economic downturn due to their low level of correlation with economic cycles. As such, these generally act as a safe haven amid political and economic turmoil. Stocks in these sectors generally outperform during periods of low growth and high uncertainty. Among these, B&G Foods Inc. (BGS) has gained 12% over the past one month. It carries a Zacks Rank #2 and a Momentum Score of B.Small CapsSmall-cap stocks have been the winners amid trade and tariff threats, and are likely to continue their outperformance. This is because small-cap stocks have less international exposure and generate most of their revenues from the domestic market. These pint-sized stocks are less vulnerable to a trade war or any other political issue and could better insulate investors from Trump’s protectionist stance. Rent-A-Center Inc. (RCII) having a Zacks Rank #2 and a VGM Score of A is among the biggest gainers in a month’s time, rising 42.5%.  High DividendThe dividend-paying securities are the major sources of consistent income for investors when returns from the equity market are at risk. These stocks offer the safety in the form of payouts and stability in the form of mature companies that are less volatile to the large swings in stock prices. The companies that offer dividends generally act as a hedge against economic uncertainty and provide downside protection by offering outsized payouts or sizable yields on a regular basis. While there are several top-ranked options available in the space, Arbor Realty Trust (ABR  -  Free Report) looks impressive given its Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and one-month return of 13.5%. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Worst ZonesFarm BeltU.S. farmers and food producers are in the crosshairs of a global trade conflict. Tariffs were already imposed by Canada on beef and by Mexico on pork and ham imports. Another round of tariff from China on soybeans and pork also come into effect in response to Trump’s latest tariff implementation. Soybean exporters like Archer Daniels Midland Company (ADM  -  Free Report) and meat producers like Tyson Foods Inc. (TSN  -  Free Report) and Hormel Foods Corporation (HRL  -  Free Report) would be hit. ADM has a Zacks Rank #2 and added 3.6% in a month while the other two has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). TSN is down 2.3% and HRL is up 1.7%.AutoThe potential tariffs on cars and auto components are the greatest threats to the auto industry. Global Automakers President and CEO John Bozzella warned “tariff hikes would raise prices, make it more expensive to produce cars and trucks in the United States. He said the tariffs could cause a slowdown in sales and production, which would not be good for either American consumers or autoworkers.” BorgWarner Inc. (BWA  -  Free Report) shed 13.9% in a month and has a Zacks Rank #3.SemiconductorsTrump’s import tariff on Chinese products will compel American semiconductor companies to pay duties on their own products. This is because chips are manufactured in the United States but are shipped to the Asian nation for assembly, testing and packaging due to its favorable labor costs, according to the Semiconductor Industry Association. Some of the worst-hit chip stocks include Intel (INTC  -  Free Report), Micron (MU  -  Free Report) and Texas Instruments (TXN  -  Free Report). INTC, MU and TXN were down 12.9%, 12.9% and 5.9%, respectively. However, these stocks have a favorable Zacks rank.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge. With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research. It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

361,ADM,"Archer Daniels Midland Company (ADM  -  Free Report) has been lately focused on improving its portfolio of Animal Nutrition products. After signing a joint development agreement with Chinese biotech company Qingdao Vland Biotech Group Co., Ltd. earlier this year, the company is looking to further enhance its Animal Nutrition footprint as it agrees to acquire France-based Neovia, which provides value-added animal nutrition solutions for the feed industry. Valued at nearly €1,535 billion, the deal is subject to customary conditions and is expected to close by the fourth quarter of 2018.The acquisition of Neovia will mark a transformative step for Archer Daniel’s Animal Nutrition business as well as a key strategic investment in France. The acquisition, which is part of the company’s value creation strategy laid in 2014, will help it deepen relationships with French farmers and French agriculture world. It will also enable the company to ink partnerships with French Cooperatives. Moreover, the acquisition will enhance Archer Daniels’ presence in Western Europe, South and Central America, and Southeast Asia where Neovia has significant operations.Further, the acquisition is perfectly in sync with the company’s growing Animal Nutrition footprint and capabilities. This, along with Neovia’s global presence as well as product and innovation expertise, with 11 R&D centers in six countries, is likely to craft a leading global animal nutrition provider, offering complete solutions for customers worldwide.Neovia is nutrition solutions provider, operating in business lines — including premix and value-added services, pet care, additives and ingredients, aquaculture and complete feed. Owned by leading French agricultural cooperative group InVivo, the company employs nearly 8,200 people and has generated global sales of €1.7bn in 2017. With more than 75% of its sales generated outside Western Europe and only little exposure in the United States, Neovia’s portfolio and footprint perfectly complement Archer Daniels’ business.Clearly, the acquisition will be a key milestone in the execution of Archer Daniels’ strategic plan and portfolio transformation. Apart from adding a diversified portfolio, the combination will enhance its geographic footprint, with an expanded presence in three continents while providing innovative capabilities to boost its Animal Nutrition business.Archer Daniels is undertaking steps to manage its business portfolio, which are expected to help in realizing the value and invest the same in best possible resources to enhance returns. The company witnessed extensive portfolio transformation in the last four years by adding capabilities in specialty, and value-added products and services. In the Animal Nutrition business, the company added premix and aquaculture capabilities in Asia; built new and modern facilities in North America; and moved into pet treats in 2017. The company has also pooled its human and animal nutrition businesses into a single business unit earlier this year, offering complete nutrition solutions.Currently, Archer Daniels carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Archer Daniels’ shares have gained 9.1% in the past year, outperforming the industry’s growth of 2.5%.3 Top-Ranked Consumer Staples StocksSome better-ranked stocks in the Consumer Staples sector include Turning Point Brands, Inc. (TPB  -  Free Report) and Medifast, Inc. (MED  -  Free Report), both sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) as well as Ollie's Bargain Outlet Holdings, Inc.

362,ADM,"A combination of a U.S. supply glut and recently imposed Chinese tariffs on imports of American agricultural products has soybeans trading at their lowest level in 9 years. Prices for corn and wheat are also trading near multi-year lows, buy soybeans have been especially hard-hit because the biggest importer of American soybeans is China.The U.S. is the world’s largest producer of soybeans and threatened tariffs of up to 30% by China could impact U.S. exports by as much as 40%. Anecdotal data from grain merchants is that Chinese customers have already drastically reduced their purchases of American soybeans for delivery later in 2018 in anticipation of having to pay steep tariffs. Those purchases are largely shifting to Brazil and Argentina, the world’s second and third biggest soybean producers, respectively.A rising dollar also hurts U.S. soybean exports as it makes domestic products relatively more expensive on the world markets.Global grain merchant Bunge LTD (BG  -  Free Report) operates a global network of facilities, including grain elevators and port terminals, covering the world’s largest agricultural regions and areas of fastest-growing food consumption.Bunge is in a unique position to not only withstand the storm in commodity prices but to actually benefit. Operating on five continents, including substantial operations in South America, Bunge is able to satisfy Chinese demand for soybeans and other grain products while avoiding tariffs on U.S. agriculture exports.After a disappointing last few years due to a supply-glut that significantly reduced profitable trading opportunities, Bunge is now well positioned to capitalize on recent price volatility. While delivering a Q1 earnings beat, the company highlighted improved results across all divisions, including Argibusiness, Edible Oils, Milling Products, Sugar and Bioenergy and Fertilizer.Bunge significantly raised revenue guidance for full year 2018 and announced that a “Global Competitiveness Program” is expected to reduced expenses by nearly $100M per year.Rising forecasts have the Zacks Consensus Earnings Estimate at $5.30 for 2018, 175% higher than 2017 and up from $3.87 just 90 days ago. Bunge Ltd is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Finally, Bunge has been the subject of takeover rumors with English commodity and mining giant Glencore reportedly considering a bid. Bunge has had informal merger discussions with both Glencore and Archer Daniels Midland (ADM  -  Free Report) over the past year but nothing has come of them so far. In general, counting on a merger or buyout to drive stock price is a shaky investment strategy at best, but with Bunge trading at a forward P/E ratio of 13.3X – below the industry average of 14.3X – having suitors contemplating a deal is bullish, whether or not the acquisition happens.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?
