The latest uproar is related to the President’s newly-released executive order, designed to provide affordable quality healthcare to the nation.Let us now have a quick look at how the medical device space has fared so far in the reporting cycle.Q3 PerformanceVarious reports suggest that hurricanes at the end of the third quarter are likely to mar revenues and earnings of several MedTech companies, primarily in Florida, Texas and Puerto Rico. MedTech major Ecolab (ECL  -  Free Report) expects the impact of the hurricanes on full-year sales and costs to be approximately 8 cents per share. In fact, Medtronic (MDT  -  Free Report) acknowledged the impact of the Hurricane Maria on its quarterly metrics. The company expects almost $250 million impact on revenues and earnings.The overall lack of visibility befuddles the favorable trend of the past few quarters in the broader Medical sector (one of the 16 Zacks sectors). Per the latest Earnings Preview, the third-quarter expected earnings growth rate for the sector is 5.2% on 4.8% revenue growth. In comparison, the reported earnings growth rate of second-quarter 2017 was quite impressive at 7% on 4.4% revenue growth.To note, there are some powerful long-term tailwinds in the medical space, including mergers & acquisitions (M&A), emerging market expansion, positive demographic trends and new product innovation. These have been a major driving force behind the sector’s impressive performance over the past few quarters even amid severe socio-economic and political instabilities.How to Make the Right Pick?With the existence of a number of industry players, finding the right stocks that have the potential to beat earnings could be a daunting task.

29,ECL,"Ecolab Inc. (ECL  -  Free Report) has had a dismal run on the bourses of late. Over the last three months, the company has returned 0.9%, below the S&P 500’s 3.4%.Intensifying competition, foreign exchange volatility, higher raw material costs and integration risks are primary headwinds for the company as of now. Let us take a look at the other major factors that have been impeding Ecolab’s growth trajectory.Ecolab Grapples With IssuesHurricanes Deal a Blow: Various reports suggest that the Hurricanes dealt a heavy blow on all MedTech majors. Ecolab is no exception in this regard, with forced shut downs of three manufacturing plants in Houston area. Management at Ecolab estimates third-quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share at the low end or slightly below the previously forecasted band of $1.36 to $1.44. For the full year, Ecolab expects adjusted earnings at the low end of the previously issued $4.70 to $4.90 range.Divestiture: Despite yielding stellar returns last year, in August, management at Ecolab announced that last quarter has been a quiet one for its Equipment Care business, which registered just 2% growth on a year-over-year basis.Adding to the woes, the segment ran short of manpower in the recent past. As a result, Ecolab announced plans to divest Equipment Care to Audax Private Equity. Growing in upper single digits, the segment witnessed strong sales of $180 million in 2016 (almost 1.4% of net sales).Diversified offerings like Equipment Care have lent Ecolab a competitive edge in the global market so far. Although the divestiture plan would enhance the company’s focus on core businesses, it is also likely to mar net revenues (read more: Ecolab to Divest Equipment Care Segment, Shares Fall).Falling Estimates: The estimate revision trend for Ecolab has been unfavorable. For the full year, four analysts moved north compared to one movement in the opposite direction over the last two months. As a result, full-year estimates declined 1.5% to $4.73 per share.For the current quarter, two analysts moved north, compared to five movements in the opposite direction over the same time frame. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-quarter earnings dropped 4.2% to $1.36 per share. The stock has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Ecolab Inc. Price and Consensus  Ecolab Inc. Price and Consensus | Ecolab Inc. Quote Stock Looks Expensive: Ecolab’s stock looks a bit overvalued at the moment. A comparative analysis of the company’s forward P/E (F12M basis) ratio reflects a relatively gloomy picture that might be a cause for investor concern. The ratio currently stands at 25.6, significantly stretched when compared with the S&P 500's P/E ratio of 18.6.Furthermore, the stock is overvalued when compared to peers. This is because the current P/E ratio (F12M basis) for the broader industry is at 18.8.Key PicksA few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are SONOVA HOLDING (SONVY  -  Free Report), IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. (IDXX  -  Free Report) and Luminex Corporation (LMNX  -  Free Report). SONOVA and Luminex sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), while IDEXX Laboratories has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

32,ECL,"Q3 earnings season has taken center stage, with 272 S&P 500 members, which account for 64.2% of the index’s total market capitalization, having reported their numbers. Per the latest Earnings Preview, total earnings for these companies are up 8.7% from the same period last year on 6.7% higher revenues, with 75.7% beating earnings and 66.2% surpassing revenue estimates.With 134 S&P 500 members lined up to release their quarterly results this week, we are decidedly bullish on the equity market, which is gradually demonstrating an improvement sequentially. Needless to say, the ongoing week is a crucial one for this season as by the end of it we will have results from more than 80% of the S&P 500 bigwigs.Medical, one of the broader sectors among the 16 Zacks sectors, is expected to put up an impressive show this quarter. For the third quarter, the expected earnings growth rate for the sector is 5.2% on 4.8% revenue growth. In comparison, the reported earnings growth rate from the second-quarter 2017 was quite impressive at 7% on 4.4% revenue growth.Let us take a look at the major factors that are likely to influence the earnings results of MedTech companies within the broader Medical universe.Factors Influencing MedTech in Q3Hurricanes Wreak Havoc Various reports suggest that hurricanes at the end of the third quarter are likely to mar revenues and earnings of several MedTech companies, primarily in Florida, Texas and Puerto Rico. MedTech major Ecolab (ECL  -  Free Report) expects the impact of the hurricanes on full-year sales and costs to be approximately 8 cents per share. In fact, Medtronic (MDT  -  Free Report) acknowledged the impact of Hurricane Maria on its quarterly metrics. The company expects an almost $250 million impact on revenues and earnings.Apart from the natural factors, a rise in unemployment (though short lived) and decline in consumer income, coupled with increasing aggregate spending, are likely to deal a heavy blow to MedTech numbers.Political ConundrumWhile the overall investment world has been gaining prominence, investors in the MedTech industry are unfortunately seeing a reverse trend. Stocks tumbled and things got riskier when the Graham-Cassidy bill to retract Obamacare failed to gain support again. And, President Trump’s latest executive order has already become a serious threat to the healthcare community at large.In this regard, let’s not forget the tax-reform pledges that Trump has taken to abolish the infamous 2.3% medical device sales tax. Although investor confidence trends upwards with the hope of ‘enactment of new tax reforms,' we believe the market has not got a whiff of it due to the lack of favorable developments on the regulatory front.Favorable Consumer Behavior Despite the political issues in the healthcare space, the change in consumer demand and market dynamics led to a dramatic transformation in the entire U.S. healthcare system over the last couple of years. This is evident from the growing prevalence of minimally-invasive surgeries, rising demand for liquid biopsy tests, use of IT for ensuring quick and improved patient care along with the shift of the payment system to a value-based model.Let’s take a look at the major Medical Product stocks slated to release their quarterly reports on Nov 2:Becton, Dickinson and Company (BDX  -  Free Report)Becton, Dickinson is scheduled to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results before the opening bell.For fiscal 2017, revenues are anticipated to increase 4.5% to 5.0%. Looking at quarterly estimates, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the BD Medical segment is at $2.105 billion for the fourth quarter, signifying sequential growth of 2.8%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Medical Surgical Systems is pegged at $908 million, up 4.4% from last quarter's reported number.The company’s innovative product pipeline is a key catalyst in our view. A plethora of regulatory approvals in the United States and international markets are helping the company to rapidly expand its product portfolio.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment stands at $38.34 billion. This reflects an improvement of almost 6.5% from the year-ago quarter.On the flipside, although generic inflation has been nominal, the rate of deflation is rising gradually. Furthermore, an anticipated shift in product mix toward lower-margin and higher-priced specialty and branded drugs will affect the company’s bottom line (read more: AmerisourceBergen Q4 Earnings: Will it Disappoint?).Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for AmerisourceBergen’s earnings stands at $1.32 per share, up 1.8% year-over-year.

The company’s strong focus on High Flow Nasal Cannula Therapy (HFNCT) is likely to lend it a competitive edge in the niche space.Solid growth in the preloaded anti-microbial and anti-thrombogenic VPS PICCs platform is likely to strengthen the vascular platform.

37,ECL,"In a bid to enhance food safety and deliver world-class warewashing results in restaurants, Ecolab Inc. (ECL  -  Free Report) recently launched the SMARTPOWER Program. Notably, the platform’s focus is on warewashing — a process of collecting dirty kitchen ware and cutlery, washing and rinsing them.The dynamic SMARTPOWER platform reduces labor, water and energy costs. Per management, the program will be rolled out this year in the United States and later in Europe.We believe, the latest development is likely to help Ecolab fortify its position in the food-hygiene space. In fact, the company recently launched a dynamic Health Department Intelligence (HDI) platform as well, to focus on food safety. The HDI platform retrieves and manages health department inspection data for foodservice operators and provides insights to help address food safety risks. This will help the company improve health inspection performance and manage food safety risks efficiently (read more: Ecolab Rolls Out HDI for Improved Food Surveillance).Supported by developments like these, Ecolab’s shares have rallied 14.4% compared with the industry’s rise of 2.4% in a year’s time.Why SMARTPOWER?SMARTPOWER is a complete warewashing program that uses proprietary chemistry and advanced cloud computing to provide skilled service, resulting in cost-effective operations, especially for restaurateurs. Per management, the advanced new chemistry helps in decomposing the buildup on wares and prevents soils from reattaching.Moreover, real-time insights on warewashing performance and personalized service will help customers identify the trends in operations. This can reduce customers’ daily dish racks up to 10%, thereby lowering the total cost.The positive results followed extensive testing across 300 foodservice environments in 21 countries. Per management, users of SMARTPOWER have reported a significant increase in wares usable for guests after the first wash, which eliminates the need to rewash them.According to bizfluent, labor is the single largest expense category for majority of restaurants. The average labor cost for a financially sustainable restaurant is 30-35% of gross sales, with 20% going to pay wage-earning staff such as servers and an additional 10-15% going to pay salaried workers such as managers. The use of real-time data in its applications has helped the company bolster its footprint in the Healthcare IT space.Market ProspectsPer Orbis Research, industry analysts forecast that the Commercial Food services Equipment market in the United States will witness a CAGR of 5.51% during the period 2017-2021.On the other hand, ResearchAndMarkets opines that the global healthcare IT solutions market is expected to reach $223.16 billion by 2023 at a CAGR of 13.7% during the period of 2018 to 2023.Thus, it can be concluded that Ecolab’s move has been timely and strategic.Zacks Rank & Key PicksEcolab currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Abiomed, Inc. (ABMD  -  Free Report), Genomic Health Inc. (GHDX  -  Free Report) and Varian Medical Systems, Inc. (VAR  -  Free Report).Abiomed has a long-term earnings growth rate of 27%. The stock sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Genomic Health has an expected earnings growth rate of 187.5% and a Zacks Rank of 1.Varian Medical has a projected long-term earnings growth rate of 8%. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

The sector is expected to rise 12.9% on 7% revenue growth this earnings season.What Awaits Medical Product Stocks?The U.S. Medical Product industry has been gaining prominence of late, courtesy of increasing life-expectancy rates, aging population, changing market dynamics and use of technologically superior devices.In fact, the industry is not dependent on just medical advancements solely. Nowadays, it relies on technological advancements in the microelectronics, telecommunications, instrumentation, biotechnology and software development industries as well.In view of the above trends, investor sentiments have been solid toward Medical-Products companies. In fact, the industry has returned 12.2%, compared to the S&P 500’s rally of 10.7% in a year’s time.

47,ECL,"A number of chemical companies are gearing up to report their quarterly numbers on May 1. Per the Zacks Industry classification, the chemical industry is grouped under the broader Basic Materials sector, which is among the Zacks sectors that are expected to score the strongest gains in Q1. Earnings for the sector are projected to surge 42.1% in Q1 while revenues are expected to move up 21%, per the latest Earnings Preview.The chemical industry is riding high on an upswing in the global economy and continued demand strength across major end-use markets such as construction and automotive. Another positive for the industry is a recovery in demand in the energy space — a key chemical end-market that had been out of favor for a while. The recovery is being driven by a rebound in crude oil prices from their historic lows.Notwithstanding a few challenges including raw material cost inflation, chemical companies are expected to continue the earnings momentum in the March quarter as the fundamental driving factors remain firmly in place.Strategic measures including productivity improvement, pricing actions and portfolio restructuring are expected to continue to drive the performance of chemical makers in Q1. Cost-cutting measures by chemical companies should continue to yield industry-wide margin improvements. Synergies from acquisitions should also lend support to earnings. Moreover, President Donald Trump’s business-friendly tax reform is a positive for U.S. chemical stocks.We take a look at four chemical companies that are gearing up to report their results tomorrow.Ecolab Inc.

49,ECL,"The Guggenheim S&P 500 Equal Weight Materials ETF (RTM  -  Free Report) made its debut on 11/01/2006, and is a smart beta exchange traded fund that provides broad exposure to the Materials ETFs category of the U.S. equity market.What Are Smart Beta ETFs?The ETF industry has long been dominated by products based on market cap weighted indexes, a strategy created to reflect the market or a particular market segment.A good option for investors who believe in market efficiency, market cap weighted indexes offer a low-cost, convenient, and transparent way of replicating market returns.There are some investors, though, who think it's possible to beat the market with great stock selection; this group likely invests in another class of funds known as smart beta, which track non-cap weighted strategies.Based on specific fundamental characteristics, or a combination of such, these indexes attempt to pick stocks that have a better chance of risk-return performance.This area offers many different investment choices, such as simplest equal-weighting, fundamental weighting and volatility/momentum based weighting methodologies; however, not all of these strategies can deliver superior results.Fund Sponsor & IndexThe fund is managed by Invesco Powershares. RTM has been able to amass assets over $250.55 M, making it one of the average sized ETFs in the Materials ETFs. RTM seeks to match the performance of the S&P 500 Equal Weight Materials Index before fees and expenses.The S&P 500 Equal Weight Materials Index is an unmanaged equal weighted version of the S&P 500 Materials Index that consists of the common stocks of the following industries: chemicals, construction materials, containers and packaging, metals and mining, and paper and forest products that comprise the Materials sector of the S&P 500 Index.Cost & Other ExpensesExpense ratios are an important factor in the return of an ETF and in the long-term, cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive cousins, other things remaining the same.Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.40%, making it on par with most peer products in the space.It's 12-month trailing dividend yield comes in at 1.39%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsIt is important to delve into an ETF's holdings before investing despite the many upsides to these kinds of funds like diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk.

50,ECL,"Ecolab Inc. (ECL  -  Free Report) is a popular name in the MedTech space. The stock has returned 12.7%, comparing favorably with the industry’s decline of 2.1% in a year’s time. Also, the current return is higher than the S&P 500’s rally of 11.4%.With a market capitalization of approximately $40.51 billion, the stock has met earnings expectations in the second and third quarter of 2017. However, the company missed estimates in the first and fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. Currently, Ecolab is grappling with stiff competition and foreign exchange volatility in the niche space. The mixed sentiments justify the stock’s Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Here we take a detailed look at the company’s performance and operations to analyze why investors should hold on to this stock.What’s Acting in Favor of Ecolab?Ecolab’s segmental businesses continue to gain from product innovation and strategic buyouts. The company’s Global Industrial segment has gained from the Water, Food & Beverage and Life Sciences units in the fourth quarter. While Global Institutional segment sales witnessed solid growth in North America and Asia Pacific, Global Energy segment sales rose on strong growth in the well stimulation business and modest gains in the downstream business.Ecolab Inc. Price and Consensus  Ecolab Inc. Price and Consensus | Ecolab Inc. QuoteEcolab’s raised guidance for 2018 instills optimism. The company expects adjusted earnings in the range of $5.25-$5.45 per share, up 12-16% year over year.For the first quarter of 2018, Ecolab expects adjusted earnings in the range of 85-93 cents per share, up from the previous range of 84-92 cents. The current outlook reflects an increase of 6-16% year over year.Ecolab has also been banking on acquisitions to gain market traction and boost profits. Recently, Ecolab acquired Cascade Water Services Inc., a privately-held company, based in New York that provides water treatment programs and services to the U.S. institutional market. Notably, acquisitions broaden services and improve opportunities in strategic water treatment market, enhancing Ecolab's ability to help customers address growing water limitations in and outside the United States.DrawbacksEcolab operates in highly competitive markets. Competitors include large companies, selling directly or through distributors, and many smaller regional players who focus on limited geographical areas, product line, and/or end-user division.Probable cost fluctuations, especially in Europe, might prove detrimental for the company. The frequent changes in oil or raw material prices, the absence of adequate and reasonably priced raw materials or their substitutes coupled with other factors can mar the business model of the company. The company further expects inflation to stay in the first half of 2018 and also to continue till the end of 2018.Despite Ecolab’s strong global foothold, volatility in currency exchange rates have adversely impacted overall results. Such volatility is expected to persist till the end of 2018.Bottom LineUnhindered by the issues, analysts are optimistic about Ecolab. For the current quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is at 88 cents, reflecting a year-over-year rise of 10%.Consequently, investors might want to hold on to the stock, courtesy of its prospects of outperforming peers in the near future.The company has been successful in driving revenues, evident from its year-over-year rise in top line. We believe strategic acquisitions and a strong international presence will continue to drive overall growth.Key PicksA few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are BIOHAVEN PHARM (BHVN  -  Free Report), Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.

Despite yielding stellar returns last year, in August, management at Ecolab announced that its equipment care business has been witnessing a quiet period lately, registering just 2% growth on a year-over-year basis in the last quarter. Adding to the woes, the segment ran short of manpower in the recent past.Apart from being a leading player in the Chemical-Specialty space, comprehensive and diversified offerings like equipment care have lent Ecolab a competitive edge in the global market.We believe the divestiture will enhance Ecolab’s strategic focus on core segments like Global Industrial, Global Institutional and Global Energy. However, it is difficult to gauge the impact of the divestiture on Ecolab’s full-year results, at least for now. In this regard, Ecolab had provided full year guidance of adjusted diluted earnings per share in the band of $4.70 to $4.90 earlier.Key PicksA few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are SONOVA HOLDING (SONVY  -  Free Report), IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.
