5,HST,"MetLife (MET), Allstate (ALL) and Prudential (PRU) topped quarterly earnings views late Wednesday. Host Hotels (HST) met EPS views.XThe results arrive as Allstate and Host Hotels and Prudential closed near buy points, while MetLife remains extended past a proper entry.Estimates: Wall Street expects the life-insurance giant to report third-quarter earnings per share of 90 cents, a 30% drop, with revenue falling 18% to $15.248 billion, according to Zacks Investment Research.Results: EPS of $1.13, with total revenue at $16.1 billion. MetLife also OK'd a new $2 billion share buyback program.Stock: Shares were little changed late. MetLife closed up 0.5% to 53.87 in the stock market today. The stock is extended above a 50.64 buy point of a cup base.The company in August spun off Brighthouse Financial (BHF), which sold life insurance in the U.S., and said that it would likely take a charge of more than $1.1 billion related to the split.The move is part of MetLife's effort to shed riskier, higher-capital or underperforming businesses, but those attempts could hit short-term profits. Profits in the life-insurance industry have been hurt by low interest rates and weaker enrollment.Estimates: The company, also among the biggest life insurance providers in the U.S., is expected to report Q3 EPS up 2% to $2.71, on revenue of $12.240 billion, down 9%.Results: EPS is $3.01.Stock: Shares were little changed late. Prudential finished up 0.2% to 110.67, trading intraday above a 110.78 buy point of a handle in a cup base.Prudential this year said it plans to restructure its U.S. businesses, a move that it said was intended to seize longer-term opportunities for growth.Zacks analysts note that the insurer stands to benefit from a surge in demand for retirement-related products from baby boomers. Prudential, like MetLife, has also shown strength internationally.Estimates: The property-and-casualty insurer is seen reporting third-quarter EPS of $1.08, down 14%, as revenue slips 8% to $8.453 billion.Results: EPS unexpectedly rose to $1.60. Revenue was $9.66 billion.Stock: Shares were little changed late. Allstate finished the regular session up 0.4% to 94.25, near a 95.35 buy point of a flat base.The results come after speculation over the GOP's tax-cut plans and hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria, which initially sank property and casualty insurers like Allstate, although investor fears eased later on. Barclays estimated that Allstate was among the firms that had the most to gain from the GOP's plans.Estimates: The high-end hotel real-estate investment trust is seen reporting an 11% drop in third-quarter funds from operation to 33 cents a share, as revenue dips 2% to $1.273 billion.Results: FFO was 33 cents. Revenue fell to $1.254 billion.Stock: Host Hotels was little changed late. Shares closed up 0.8% to 19.72. The stock is near a 20.31 buy point of a flat base.

8,HST,"J. Willard Marriott knew he didn't want to stake his future on the unpredictable livestock market. He saw enough of that from his father, who struggled financially in Marriott-Slaterville, Utah.So after graduating from the University of Utah, Willard struck out for Washington, D.C., in 1927 to set up an A&W; Root Beer franchise.He was ready for the business world. At age 13, he had farmed his own plot of land, earning $2,000 (worth $49,000 now) that season by planting produce that he determined the food markets needed.Two years later, in 1915, he rode a trainload of lambs to San Francisco to supply restaurants stocking up for the Panama-Pacific International Exposition.Likewise, he knew the Washington area from his travels doing Mormon missionary work. So Willard and his new bride, Alice, drove in their Model T Ford confidently.With them was $1,500 that he'd earned from selling woolen goods to lumber camps on commission.A Start With Root BeerAfter landing in the nation's capital, Willard borrowed another $1,500 to open a root beer outlet on 14th Street. His new partner, Hugh Colton, also invested $3,000.The return was impressive. The first year, from 1927 to 1928, sales totaled $16,000 — worth $220,000 today — and Marriott soon bought out his partner.Marriott's A&W; root beer franchise was finding sweet profit in charging 5 cents for a frosty mug filled with root beer.From this humble beginning, Marriott built a global food service and hospitality enterprise by paying attention to details and providing quality at a reasonable price.The firm lives on as Marriott International (MAR), which had 2014 sales of $14 billion and has enjoyed a 550% stock ride since 2009.Marriott (1900-85) steadily expanded his operation. He shifted his A&W; stand into selling hot food and opened other D.C.-area outlets.Next came a name change. Alice came up with Hot Shoppe, devised menu items, decorated the restaurants and kept the company books.Marriott understood the risky nature of starting a new business, with 50% failing during the first five years of operation. He felt that pain with a Washington bank that closed paying only 20 cents on the dollar to its account holders.To avert such failure on the food front, he paid attention to every detail. He hired youngsters as traffic counters at key intersections around town in order to situate new restaurants properly.Marriott's big innovation was opening the first drive-in in Washington in the summer of 1928. To advertise the new restaurant, employees passed out tickets around town for free root beer. Customers came nonstop all day long.By the 1930s, the Marriott enterprise of eight restaurants stretched all the way to Baltimore.He was on a roll, even preparing meals for Eastern Air Transport. From this venture, his firm launched its in-flight catering service for all airlines serving the D.C. area in 1937.All the while, Marriott visited every operation of Hot Shoppes and made it a point to shake hands with employees while giving the kitchen and serving areas a white-glove inspection.He insisted on cleanliness, tasty food, reasonable prices and the complete standardization of the menu for each facility.He lived by the mantra ""if you take care of your employees, they will take care of your customers.""He instituted bonuses for managers and gifts for longevity of service. When employees had personal tragedies, he comforted them and aided them financially.""J.W. Marriott was a pioneer in employee advocacy,"" George Haley, director of the Center for International Industry Competitiveness and a University of New Haven marketing professor, told IBD. ""Only 41% percent of companies engage in it today.""With the birth of their two sons, J. Willard Jr. in 1932 and Richard in 1939, Alice stepped away from day-to-day operations but remained a force behind major corporate decisions.Meanwhile, the '30s were traumatic, as her husband was diagnosed with cancer of the lymph nodes and was expected to live only a year or less. But Marriott lived 50 more years, worked to the hilt and saw his elder son take over the reins of the business he had founded.Hard Work""J. Willard built a solid and extremely profitable business by taking to heart that no person can get very far in this world on a 40-hour week, "" said executive coach Karissa Thacker in Wilmington, Del. ""He kept seizing new opportunities to expand and continually experimented with his operations to perfect them. His life is a testament to learning agility.""During World War II, Marriott contracted to provide meals to the Naval Communications Annex and industrial war facilities surrounding Washington. All of this activity fed company coffers that continued to grow well after the war ended in 1945. By 1952, revenue approached $20 million (worth $178 million now), generated from 58 outlets.The next year, Hot Shoppes went public at $10.25 per share. According to Lawrence Friedman's 2012 book, ""Go to Market Strategy,"" $1,000 invested in 1953 in the firm that would turn into Marriott International would be worth well over $1 million today.Then came 1957, a watershed year for Marriott. He opened his first hotel, the 365-room Twin Bridges in Arlington, Va.By then, his company had doubled its revenue over five years to $38 million (the equivalent of $320 million now). Ten years later came a name change to Marriott Inc.The company's leadership transition from Willard to Jr. — who went by Bill — started with the launching of that first hotel.In 1972, Bill rose to chief executive and helped transform the family business into a global empire.""Bill was one of the first to introduce revenue management to the hotel industry, employing analytical tools to predict consumer behavior,"" said Haley. ""He also recognized the segmented hotel market and developed brands for each price point.""Death And BeyondMarriott died age 84 at his summer home in New Hampshire. He is buried in Rockville, Md.Eight years after his death, the company split into two, Marriott International and Host Marriott, the second of which would change its name to Host Hotels & Resorts (HST) and become the nation's largest lodging real estate investment trust, with 2014 revenue of $5.4 billion.Bill relinquished the role of CEO of Marriott International to Arne Sorenson in 2011 and took on the title of executive chairman, helping oversee one of the world's largest lodging companies, with over 3,900 facilities consisting of almost 715,000 rooms in 79 countries.""I'm sure it was daunting to step into the shoes of J.W., a larger-than-life business figure, but Bill kept his father's corporate culture in place and chose his own areas to expand, being one of the first hotel executives to recognize the potential overseas,"" said Thacker.James Berkeley of London-based Ellice Consulting lauds the company that John Willard Marriott left behind for applying ""common sense more consistently and constantly than anyone else in the global lodging business. After first owning their hotels, they switched to franchising to minimize the competitive threat and improve the return on their capital. Their managers and employees are among the best in the industry and stem from their core values of taking care of its people, employing sound business practices, embracing change and pursuing excellence.""

QuoteNote: The EPS numbers presented in the above chart represent funds from operations (“FFO”) per share.Currently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter FFO per share is pegged at 33 cents.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderHost Hotels boasts a portfolio of upscale hotels across lucrative markets in the United States. Also, the company is making concerted efforts to enhance its portfolio quality through strategic capital-recycling program. The company is making opportunistic acquisitions, as well as making strategic redevelopments to fortify its position in global vibrant markets. In addition, Host Hotels has a decent balance sheet and ample liquidity.However, the company anticipates third-quarter results to be weaker than the first half. This is because of the impact of holiday shift — the Jewish holidays moving back from October to September, and tough comps related to the Olympics in Brazil in the third quarter last year. As such, the company expects 21% of its total EBITDA for 2017 to be generated in the quarter under review. Further, supply growth in the company’s key markets remains a concern.Amid these, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter revenues is pegged at $1.27 billion, marking an estimated decline of 1.7% year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Room Revenues is $883 million, denoting a decrease from $940 million reported in the prior quarter, while the Food and Beverage revenues estimate is pegged at $332 million which is also below $416 million reported in the previous quarter. Also, in a month’s time, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of FFO per share for the third quarter moved down 2.9% to 33 cents, underlining analysts’ bearish sentiments.Nevertheless, Host Hotels’ shares have rallied 7.3% over the past six months, outperforming the industry’s gain of 0.6%.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Host Hotels will likely beat estimates this season. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

Further, its productivity-improvement efforts are anticipated to drive performance over the long term.Demand is likely to rise amid improving corporate profits, business investment, consumer sentiment and low unemployment level. Particularly, group business demand is likely to be decent in the rest of the year with solid group booking pace.The company has a strategic capital-recycling program to improve its portfolio quality and strengthen its position in major markets. During first-quarter 2018, Host Hotels completed the acquisition of the 301-room Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort, 668-room Grand Hyatt San Francisco and 454-room Hyatt Regency Coconut Point Resort and Spa for $1 billion.Meanwhile, the company has been monetizing a considerable part of real estate in Washington DC and lowering its exposure in New York.

34,HST,"The net lease real estate investment trust — W. P. Carey Inc. (WPC  -  Free Report) — has recently agreed to merge Corporate Property Associates 17, Global Incorporated (""CPA:17""), in a stock-for-stock deal valued at around $6 billion.The move would substantially enhance W. P. Carey’s size and scale with pro forma equity market capitalization of around $10.9 billion and pro forma enterprise value of about $17.3 billion. Also, it would improve earnings quality and significantly boost the company’s real estate adjusted funds from operations (AFFO) derived from long-term, recurring lease revenues.Per the terms of the agreement, shareholders of CPA:17 would receive a fixed exchange ratio of 0.16 shares of W. P. Carey common stock for each share of CPA:17 they hold. Based on W. P. Carey's closing share price of $67.03 as of Jun 15, 2018, this equals $10.72 per share. Expected to close at or around Dec 31, 2018, the deal will see CPA:17 being merged with and into a subsidiary of W. P. Carey. While the board of directors of both W. P. Carey and CPA:17 has given their nod for this transaction, its closure is now subject to approval from their stockholders.According to Jason Fox, W. P. Carey's chief executive officer, ""This transaction simplifies our business and effectively transforms W. P. Carey into a pure-play net lease REIT with earnings derived almost entirely from higher-multiple lease revenues"".Particularly, the higher-multiple real estate segment is estimated to generate around 96% of total pro forma AFFO, up from its current level of 83%. Moreover, the deal seems a strategic fit because it would increase tenant and industry diversification besides extending the weighted-average lease term to 10.4 years. Further, it would improve the overall credit profile, lower debt to gross assets, and is expected to place W. P. Carey with better capital access.Notably, New York-based W. P. Carey has an enterprise value of more than $10 billion and a portfolio of commercial real estate, aggregating 886 properties, spanning around 85 million square feet of space. On the other hand, CPA:17 is the largest fund advised by W. P. Carey and owns a high-quality, diversified, primarily net lease portfolio. Particularly, CPA:17’s portfolio includes 411 properties across 44 million square feet of space.The combined portfolio would have 26% of its total portfolio belonging to the office category, 24% industrial, and 19% each of warehouse and retail properties. Given the healthy fundamentals of these asset categories, W. P. Carey is expected to ride on the growth curve with this buyout.W. P. Carey currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

35,HST,"A smart beta exchange traded fund, the Guggenheim Multi-Asset Income ETF (CVY  -  Free Report) debuted on 09/21/2006, and offers broad exposure to the Total Market (U.S.) ETFs category of the U.S. equity market.What Are Smart Beta ETFs?Market cap weighted indexes were created to reflect the market, or a specific segment of the market, and the ETF industry has traditionally been dominated by products based on this strategy.Market cap weighted indexes offer a low-cost, convenient, and transparent way of replicating market returns, and are a good option for investors who believe in market efficiency.On the other hand, some investors who believe that it is possible to beat the market by superior stock selection opt to invest in another class of funds that track non-cap weighted strategies--popularly known as smart beta.By attempting to pick stocks that have a better chance of risk-return performance, non-cap weighted indexes are based on certain fundamental characteristics, or a combination of such.Methodologies like equal-weighting, one of the simplest options out there, fundamental weighting, and volatility/momentum based weighting are all choices offered to investors in this space, but not all of them can deliver superior returns.Fund Sponsor & IndexThe fund is managed by Invesco, and has been able to amass over $294.75 M, which makes it one of the larger ETFs in the Total Market (U.S.) ETFs. Before fees and expenses, this particular fund seeks to match the performance of the Zacks Multi-Asset Income Index.The Zacks Multi-Asset Income Index is comprised of approximately 125 to 150 stocks selected, based on a multi-factor proprietary model, from a universe of domestic and international companies, including U.S.-listed common stocks, ADRs paying dividends, REITs, MLPs, closed-end funds and traditional preferred stocks.Cost & Other ExpensesCost is an important factor in selecting the right ETF, and cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive cousins if all other fundamentals are the same.Operating expenses on an annual basis are 0.79% for CVY, making it on par with most peer products in the space.CVY's 12-month trailing dividend yield is 3.96%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsEven though ETFs offer diversified exposure that minimizes single stock risk, investors should also look at the actual holdings inside the fund. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.When you look at individual holdings, Valero Energy Corp (VLO  -  Free Report) accounts for about 1.35% of the fund's total assets, followed by Phillips 66 (PSX  -  Free Report) and Host Hotels & Resorts Inc (HST  -  Free Report).CVY's top 10 holdings account for about 11.7% of its total assets under management.Performance and RiskCVY has gained about 1.38% so far this year, and as of 06/14/2018, is up roughly 10.38% in the last one year. In the past 52-week period, the fund has traded between $20.64 and $23.39.CVY has a beta of 0.86 and standard deviation of 12.73% for the trailing three-year period. With about 149 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.Bottom LineTo learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.

36,HST,"When a rate hike is announced by the Federal Reserve, investors in the REIT space are usually skittish because of the sector’s dependence on debt and the investment world treating them as bond substitutes for their high and consistent dividend-paying nature. There was no exception this time too and the REIT industry went into red, when the much anticipated rate hike occurred this time.However, instead of fretting over the rate that was increased by a quarter percentage point in the recently concluded FOMC meeting and brooding too much on the indication of two more hikes later this year, we ought to shift attention to the better outlook offered by the Fed in terms of GDP growth for 2018. More good news is a positive revision in projected inflation and a slash in the Fed’s forecast for unemployment.Such an environment can be far more rewarding for the REITs business, which usually buoys up on a stepped-up economy and job scenario. And why not? With one eventually requiring “real space” for economic activities, prospects of the real estate sector get a boost as growth in the economy and job market translates into greater demand for real estate and higher occupancy levels.Particularly, with a recovering economy and job market gains as well as tax reforms, consumption levels are anticipated to remain elevated. And with a healthy manufacturing environment and high business inventories, demand for warehouse and logistics real estate is anticipated to be high, giving significant impetus to industrial REITs to flourish.In fact, in recent years, companies are being compelled to enhance and renovate their distribution and production platforms to support the e-commerce business, address a large customer base and urbanization. Services like same-day delivery are gaining traction, propelling demand for modern distribution facilities. Also, last-mile properties are witnessing a solid increase in asset values.These have helped the industrial REITs to scale new heights. Per a study by the commercial real estate services firm, CBRE Group Inc. (CBRE  -  Free Report), availability fell for 31 straight quarters to 7.3% for the U.S. industrial market in first-quarter 2018. Moreover, with demand surpassing new supply, net asking rents climbed 1.9% in Q1 to $7.01 per square foot, denoting the highest level since 1989.Lodging/Resorts REITs too are in the favorable bunch as an improving economy, growth in employment and rise in wages are likely to drive demand for hotels. Particularly, improved business travel demand with lower cancellations and higher group spends, plus strong demand from the leisure division signal brighter prospects for these REITs.4 Stocks to Scoop Big GainsHere we have handpicked four REIT stocks from the above-mentioned asset categories that sport a top Zacks Rank. These stocks have been witnessing positive estimate revisions. Also, their underlying asset categories display strength with the economy and the job market showing signs of recovery. Moreover, don’t ignore the hiccups in stock prices with rate hikes, because these can provide solid entry points.San Francisco-based Prologis Inc. (PLD  -  Free Report) is a leading industrial REIT engaged in the acquisition, development and operation of industrial properties in North America, Europe, and Asia. In April, Prologis announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement with DCT Industrial Trust to acquire the latter in an $8.4-billion stock-for-stock deal. The combined portfolio will enable the company to realize significant synergies and strengthen its position in key markets. Prologis has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Prologis has a long-term growth rate of 5% and the trend in current-year funds from operations (FFO) per share estimate revisions indicates a solid earnings outlook for the company. In fact, the stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 FFO per share being revised 2.4% upward in two months’ time.Terreno Realty Corp. (TRNO  -  Free Report), also based in San Francisco, is engaged in the acquisition, ownership and operation of industrial real estate in six major coastal U.S. markets — Los Angeles, Northern New Jersey/New York City, San Francisco Bay Area, Seattle, Miami, and Washington, D.C. The stock has a Zacks Rank of 2. Presently, its long-term expected growth rate is 10%. Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 FFO per share moved north by 6.7% over the past two months, signaling increased confidence of analysts in the company’s solid earnings outlook.West Palm Beach, FL-based Chatham Lodging Trust (CLDT  -  Free Report) is focused mainly on investing in premium-branded upscale extended-stay and select-service hotels. It has a Zacks Rank of 2. The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 and 2019 being revised respectively 1% and 2.6% upward in the past two months.Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc. (HST  -  Free Report), headquartered at Bethesda, MD, is one of the leading lodging REITs having a portfolio of luxury and upper-upscale hotels in the United States and abroad. The stock has a Zacks Rank of 2. Strategic capital-recycling program and a healthy balance sheet bode well for long-term growth.

37,HST,"Shares of Extra Space Storage Inc. (EXR  -  Free Report) have outperformed the industry it belongs to, in the past three months. The company’s shares have gained 10.8%, while the industry recorded 5% growth, during this time period.Notably, there are enough reasons to expect a solid upside for this self-storage REIT stock. Particularly, the earnings outlook and fundamentals of Extra Space Storage appear assertive enough to drive its stock higher in the near term.The company has been making concerted efforts to expand its business around large population centers and diversify geographically. Extra Space Storage has significantly expanded its business in recent years, growing its branded store count from 694 in 2008 to 1,523 in first-quarter 2018. Also, total stores managed for third-party owners increased from 185 in 2011 to 456 in the reported quarter.Moreover, over the past five years, Extra Space Storage acquired $4.5 billion in properties. The company gained an elevated scale in several core markets on the back of these acquisitions, as well as fortified its presence in a number of new markets.As a result, this Salt Lake City, UT-based self-storage REIT emerged as the second largest self-storage operator, as well as the largest self-storage management company in the United States. Majority of this REIT’s stores are situated around large population centers which enjoy above-average population and income demographics for stores.In addition, the self-storage asset category is basically need-based and recession-resilient in nature. This asset class has low capital expenditure requirements and generates high operating margins. Additionally, the self-storage industry is likely to continue experiencing solid demand, backed by favorable demographic changes, and events like marriages, shifting, death and even divorce.Extra Space Storage enjoyed a historical cash flow growth (3-5 years) of 27.9%, which comfortably exceeded the industry’s growth of 17.3%. Additionally, the company’s current cash flow growth of 16.3% is way ahead of the industry’s rate of 6.2%.Also, its Return on Equity (ROE) is 18.9% compared with the industry’s average of 4.9%. This reflects that the company reinvests more efficiently compared to the industry. Further, the company remains committed to boost shareholders’ wealth. It has achieved five-year total increase of a whopping 212% in dividend.Moreover, in May, ushering in good news for its shareholders, Extra Space Storage announced a 10.3% hike in its quarterly cash dividend. The company will now pay a dividend of 86 cents per share, up from 78 cents paid earlier. The raised dividend will be paid on Jun 29, to shareholders of record as of Jun 15, 2018.  Such shareholder-friendly efforts are encouraging.Furthermore, the industry is characterized by fragmented ownership, and only around 20% of the total self-storage square footage is under REIT’s ownership. This creates solid scope for consolidation at some level in the future and with a solid balance sheet, Extra Space Storage remains well poised to compete for acquisitions.Moreover, the trend in estimate revisions indicates a solid earnings outlook for this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock. In fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 FFO per share has witnessed 0.4% upward revision in a month’s time. Given its progress on the fundamentals, the stock is likely to perform well in the quarters ahead.Stocks to ConsiderInvestors can also consider other similarly-ranked stocks in the real estate space like Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc. (HST  -  Free Report), Lamar Advertising Company (LAMR  -  Free Report) and Prologis, Inc. (PLD  -  Free Report). All three stocks carry a Zacks Rank of 2.

38,HST,"A solid jobs report for the month of May has triggered chances of a rate hike this month by the Federal Reserve. However, investors in the REIT space can shrug off such issues. This is because even though REITs have traditionally depended on debt for their business and were considered as bond substitutes for the high and consistent dividend-paying nature making their short-term returns susceptible to rate moves, this time around, these companies seem to be better poised to brave the rising rate environment.In fact, over the years, REITs have shored up capital and made concerted efforts to reduce leverage. These have resorted to equity capital rather than brooding too much on debt capital to finance their portfolio and carry on their business. Moreover, the healthy economy serves as a positive catalyst for demand for many of the asset categories.Also, the returns for May indicate the abating of the rate hike concerns. In fact, REITs delivered an encouraging performance in the month, as well as outperformed the broader market in the month. Per the data from REIT.com, total returns of the FTSE Nareit All REITs Index logged in a gain of 3.5% in the month, while the S&P 500 rose 2.4%.Lodging REITs ruled the market in May, with returns from this sector shooting up to 11.9%. Obviously, the news of Blackstone Group LP’s plan to acquire LaSalle Hotel Properties (LHO  -  Free Report), in a $4.8-billion all-cash deal, served as a tailwind and pulled in the attention of investors to this sector. Also, healthcare REITs gained 7.5%, while freestanding retail REIT reported 6.7% increase in returns, as earnings were comparatively better than what was apprehended.Notably, after lackluster performance in the first two months of 2018, the U.S. REIT industry has been gaining solid ground. Returns rebounded in March and were in the positive territory in April as well. In fact, the mojo seems to be back in the market, following the steady performance of REITs in Q1.Per the latest NAREIT media release, the Q1 scorecard revealed that funds from operations (FFO) totaled $15.3 billion, denoting a 3.6% increase on a sequential basis and growth of 6%, year over year. Same-store net operating income (NOI) increased 2.5% year over year. Occupancy rates for all Equity REITs were high at 93.6% and managed growth of 18 basis points on a year-over-year basis, but witnessed a marginal sequential slip.Admittedly, high consumer confidence in an improving economy and job market gains have been fueling consumption levels. In fact, with one eventually requiring “real space” for economic activities, prospects of the real estate sector are getting a boost as growth in the economy translates into greater demand for real estate and higher occupancy levels.Further, valuation wise, several REIT stocks seem attractive, while encouraging performance by a number of REITs in Q1, as well as an increase in merger and acquisition activities in the industry, point at the prevailing favorable environment and re-instill confidence.Thus, the time is now apt to bet on some REIT stocks that have a favorable rank and solid scopes for growth in a recovering economy. As a bonus point, these companies have enjoyed positive estimate revisions from analysts, reflecting their bullish sentiments.Here are the four picks:  Bethesda, MD-based Pebblebrook Hotel Trust (PEB  -  Free Report) is a hotel REIT engaged in the acquisition and investment of hotel properties mainly in upper upscale, full-service hotels situated in urban markets in major gateway cities.

39,HST,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc. (HST  -  Free Report). Shares have added about 12.3% in that time frame.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is HST due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Host Hotels Beats on Q1 FFO and Revenues, Raises ViewHost Hotels & Resorts reported first-quarter 2018 adjusted FFO of 43 cents per share, which outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 41 cents. However, the adjusted FFO per share fell shy of the year-ago quarter tally of 44 cents.Results reflect margin improvement through better productivity. However, the year-over-year decline mainly reflects increase in interest expenses and additional tax expenses. The company has also raised its outlook for full-year 2018.The company generated total revenues of around $1.35 billion, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.33 billion, but marginally (0.1%) slipped from the year-ago tally. The year-over-year decline mainly reflects the impact of dispositions of five hotels in 2017 and in early 2018.Notably, during the quarter, Host Hotels completed the acquisition of 301-room Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort, 668-room Grand Hyatt San Francisco and 454-room Hyatt Regency Coconut Point Resort and Spa for $1 billion.Quarter in DetailsDuring the reported quarter, comparable hotel revenues increased 1.5% year over year to nearly $1.3 billion. Comparable hotel revenue per available room or RevPAR (on a constant dollar basis) was up 1.7% year over year, driven by a 170 basis points (bps) expansion in occupancy, partly offset by a 0.6% decrease in average room rate. For domestic properties, comparable hotel RevPAR was up 1.6% while the same for International properties climbed 9.3%.For the first quarter, comparable hotel EBITDA increased 3.7%. Comparable hotel EBITDA margin improved 60 bps, reflecting improvement in operating efficiencies, higher ancillary revenues and a tax rebate at one property. Finally, the company exited first-quarter 2018 with around $323 million of unrestricted cash and $511 million of available capacity remaining under the revolver part of its credit facility. In addition, as of Mar 31, 2018, total debt was $4.3 billion, having an average maturity of 4.8 years and an average interest rate of 3.9%. Notably, the company has no debt maturities until 2020.Host Hotels did not buy back any shares in 2018. It has $500 million of capacity available under its current repurchase program.During the first quarter, the company expended around $115 million on capital expenditures — $29 million was return on investment (ROI) capital projects, and $86 million for renewal and replacement projects.OutlookHost Hotels has raised its outlook for full-year 2018. The company now expects 2018 adjusted FFO per share in the range of $1.67-$1.73, denoting a 5 cents increase at the midpoint from the earlier guidance of $1.60-$1.70.The company’s full-year projection includes comparable hotel RevPAR (constant U.S. dollar basis) growth of 1.5-2.5%, reflecting expansion of 50 bps at the midpoint. Moreover, the company continues to expect capital expenditures of $475-$550 million for the year. This comprises $185-$220 million in ROI projects, and $290-$330 million in renewal and replacement projects.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in fresh estimates.

40,HST,"Industrial REITs have been firing on all cylinders and per a study by the commercial real estate services firm — CBRE Group Inc. (CBRE  -  Free Report) — availability fell for 31 straight quarters to 7.3% for the U.S. industrial market in Q1. Moreover, with demand surpassing new supply, net asking rents climbed 1.9% in the quarter to $7.01 per square foot, marking the highest level since 1989.In fact, companies are now compelled to enhance and renovate their distribution and production platforms, in order to support e-commerce business, address a large customer base and urbanization. Services like same-day delivery are gaining traction, propelling demand for modern distribution facilities. Also, last-mile properties are witnessing a solid increase in asset values.However, not all industrial REITs are equally poised to excel. Rather, only the ones with solid capacity and healthy fundamentals remain well poised to capitalize on this trend.One such stock is Prologis Inc. (PLD  -  Free Report). This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock has risen 15.4% in a year’s time, against its industry’s decline of 3.6%. There is further scope for solid price appreciation given the REIT’s sound fundamentals and improving prospects.In fact, in April 2018, Prologis announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement with DCT Industrial Trust Inc. (DCT  -  Free Report) to acquire the latter in an $8.4-billion stock-for-stock deal, including debt assumption. Notably, the deal, which is anticipated to create near-term synergies of nearly $80 million, was unanimously approved by both companies’ board of directors. DCT shareholders will be given 1.02 shares of Prologis in exchange of each DCT share. The transaction, subject to other customary closing conditions, is expected to close in third-quarter 2018.Moreover, backed by solid operating results, Prologis put up a stellar show in first-quarter 2018. Net effective rent change improved in the quarter, while period-end occupancy remained high. This industrial REIT also raised its guidance for 2018 core funds from operations (FFO) per share.What Makes Prologis a Solid Choice?Revenue Strength: Prologis’ top line has been displaying strength for the past several quarters. In fact, since first-quarter 2015 through first-quarter 2018, the company reported better-than-expected revenue figures in each quarter. Given the strength in its fundamentals, this upbeat trend is likely to continue ahead.Cash Flow Growth: Prologis enjoyed a historical cash flow growth (3-5 years) of 22.3%, which comfortably exceeded the industry’s growth of 17.3%. Also, the company’s current cash flow growth of 19.1% is way ahead of the industry’s rate of 6.2%. Finally, the company exited first-quarter 2018 with more than $3.6 billion of liquidity.FFO per Share Growth: Prologis witnessed 14.9% growth in FFO per share, over the last three-five years, against 6.3% of that of the industry. In addition, its FFO per share is estimated to grow at the rate of 7.1% for the current year, ahead of 3.1% of that of the industry.Strong Leverage: The debt-to-equity ratio for Prologis is 0.51 compared with the industry average of 0.84. This highlights greater financial stability of the company and lesser risk for shareholders.Superior ROE: Prologis’ Return on Equity (ROE) is 9.86% compared with the industry’s average of 4.9%. This indicates that the company reinvests more efficiently compared to the industry.Estimate Revisions: The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year FFO per share being revised 0.7% upward to $2.98 in a month’s time. Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the next year has been revised north, over the past three months. This reflects analysts’ bullish sentiments on the stock.Going forward, with a recovering economy and job market gains, as well as tax reforms, consumption levels are anticipated to remain elevated. And with a healthy manufacturing environment and high business inventories, demand for warehouse and logistics real estate will likely be high. Given Prologis’ solid capacity, it remains well poised to capitalize on this trend.Other Stocks to ConsiderOther similarly-ranked stocks in the REIT space include Chatham Lodging Trust (CLDT  -  Free Report) and Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc. (HST  -  Free Report), each carrying a Zacks Rank of 2.

42,HST,"Investors looking for stocks in the REIT and Equity Trust - Other sector might want to consider either CCA (CXW  -  Free Report) or Host Hotels (HST  -  Free Report). But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks? Let's take a closer look.There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks, but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns. The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions, while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits.CCA and Host Hotels are both sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) right now. This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that these stocks have improving earnings outlooks. But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors.Value investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors.CXW currently has a forward P/E ratio of 9.35, while HST has a forward P/E of 12.56. We also note that CXW has a PEG ratio of 1.56. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. HST currently has a PEG ratio of 2.51.Another notable valuation metric for CXW is its P/B ratio of 1.74. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, HST has a P/B of 2.24.These are just a few of the metrics contributing to CXW's Value grade of A and HST's Value grade of C.Both CXW and HST are impressive stocks with improving earnings outlooks. But considering the above metrics, value investors will likely feel that CXW is the better option right now.

43,HST,"Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc. (HST  -  Free Report) is likely to gain from its solid portfolio of upscale hotels across markets with potential. Furthermore, the company’s strategic capital-recycling program and a healthy balance sheet bode well for its long-term growth. Moreover, Host Hotels is anticipated to improve the revenues per available room backed by its value-enhancement initiatives.Nonetheless, elevated supply in the company’s key markets is expected to reduce its pricing power. Further, geographical concentration of assets in upscale markets exposes it to the economic doldrums prevailing in the region.Earlier this month, the company reported first-quarter 2018 adjusted funds from operations (FFO) of 43 cents per share, outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 41 cents. Results reflect margin improvement through better productivity.Also, Host Hotels has raised its outlook for full-year 2018. The company now expects 2018 adjusted FFO per share in the range of $1.67-$1.73, denoting 5 cents increase at the midpoint from the earlier guidance of $1.60-$1.70.Notably, Host Hotels undertakes a strategic capital-recycling program to improve its portfolio quality and strengthen its position over vibrant global markets. Furthermore, the company has been monetizing a considerable part of real estate in Washington D.C. and lowering its exposure in New York.During first-quarter 2018, Host Hotels completed the acquisition of 301-room Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort, 668-room Grand Hyatt San Francisco and 454-room Hyatt Regency Coconut Point Resort and Spa for $1 billion. Moreover, during the reported quarter, the company’s capital expenditures were around $115 million — $29 million was allocated to return on investment (ROI) capital projects and $86 million for the renewal and replacement projects.The company continues to expect capital expenditures of $475-$550 million for 2018. This comprises $185-$220 million in ROI projects and $290-$330 million in the renewal and replacement projects. Such investments are likely to help the company improve its portfolio quality and bolster revenues.Further, Host Hotels has a decent balance sheet and ample liquidity. The company exited first-quarter 2018 with around $323 million of unrestricted cash and $511 million of available capacity remaining under the revolver part of its credit facility. Notably, the company has no debt maturities until 2020. This provides it ample scope for deploying capital for long-term growth opportunities while carrying out redevelopment initiatives.Though supply growth has been tepid in the past, it has gathered momentum in recent times. In fact, supply growth is expected to remain elevated in 2018 as well as 2019, particularly in markets where the company has exposure.As the majority of Host Hotels’ properties are concentrated in the luxury and upper-upscale segments, during any economic downturn, these segments bear the brunt as unfavorable macroeconomic conditions compel customers to reduce discretionary spending and choose lower-priced brands over the company’s premium ones. Also, the hotel industry is cyclical in nature and heavily dependent on the overall health of economies in which it operates.Though an economic slowdown has an immediate impact on the company’s revenues, many of the expense categories associated with owning and operating hotels, such as debt-service payments, property taxes, insurance, utilities, and employee wages and benefits, remain relatively inflexible.In the past three months, shares of Host Hotels have outperformed the industry it belongs to. This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company’s shares have ascended 18.4% while the industry recorded growth of 7.8% during this time frame.Additionally, the stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 FFO per share being revised 3.6% upward in a month’s time. Given the progress on the fundamentals, the stock is likely to perform well in the upcoming period.Other Stocks Worth a LookSome other top-ranked stocks from the same space are Arbor Realty Trust (ABR  -  Free Report), Chatham Lodging Trust (CLDT  -  Free Report) and Prologis, Inc. (PLD  -  Free Report). All three stocks carry a Zacks Rank of 2.

44,HST,"Jones Lang LaSalle Incorporated (JLL  -  Free Report), popularly known as JLL, recently amended its bank credit facility and extended the maturity of the bank's existing $2.75-billion unsecured revolving credit facility. The borrowing capacity remained intact, but the maturity was extended to May 2023 from the current date in June 2021.The move is encouraging down the line for the company’s operational efficiency as it enhances the financial flexibility as well as provides support for JLL’s growth strategy.Notably, JLL’s robust balance sheet helps it manage debt level in an efficient way. Though at the end of first-quarter 2018, the company’s net debt increased $323.9 million from the end of the prior quarter to $910.1 million, it was successfully brought down by $477.8 million from the prior-year figure. The sequential increase was due to the annual first-quarter payment of variable compensation to employees as it delivered strong results in 2017.Nonetheless, the company is on track to reduce the debt levels. The year-over-year improvement reflects a significant progress in the company’s business performance and working-capital management. Backed by a solid balance sheet and healthy debt position, the company remains well poised to continue with its growth momentum.Christie B. Kelly, the chief financial officer of JLL, informed, ""Our balance sheet strength and investment-grade ratings reflect our commitment to profitable growth. Our stronger credit facility, supported by a top-tier banking group, provides liquidity and capacity at attractive pricing to maintain our capital allocation growth strategy including technology investments consistent with our digital agenda.""Shares of this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company have surged 49.6% over the past year, widely outperforming 9.8% growth of the industry. Other Stocks Worth a LookA few other top-ranked stocks from the REIT space include Arbor Realty Trust (ABR  -  Free Report), Prologis, Inc.

45,HST,"So what if the U.S. REIT industry did not have a smooth start this year with returns turning negative in the first two months? The sector not only rebounded in March, but was also in the positive territory in April despite the rate hike and high treasury yields. And now, it has emerged from the latest NAREIT media release that the operating performance of this special hybrid asset class was decent in Q1.  Specifically, the Q1 scorecard reveals that funds from operations (FFO) totaled $15.3 billion, denoting a 3.6% increase on a sequential basis and growth of 6% year over year. Same-store net operating income (NOI) increased 2.5% year over year. Occupancy rates for all Equity REITs were high at 93.6% and managed growth of 18 basis points on a year-over-year basis, while it saw a slight sequential slip.Among the top-performing Equity REIT property segments, Industrial, Manufactured Homes, Diversified and Office, witnessed robust same-store NOI growth of 5.6%, 4.8%, 4.1% and 3.5%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis.No doubt, industrial REITs are firing on all cylinders and per a study by the commercial real estate services firm — CBRE Group Inc. (CBRE  -  Free Report) — availability fell for 31 straight quarters to 7.3% for the U.S. industrial market in first-quarter 2018. Moreover, with demand surpassing new supply, net asking rents climbed 1.9% in Q1 to $7.01 per square feet, denoting the highest level since 1989.In fact, to support e-commerce business, address a large customer base and urbanization, companies are being compelled to enhance and renovate their distribution and production platforms. Services like same-day delivery are gaining traction, propelling demand for modern distribution facilities. Also, last-mile properties are witnessing a solid increase in asset values.However, retail REITs are not in the pink as mall traffic continues to suffer from the rapid shift in customers' shopping preference through the online channel. In fact, with ecommerce gaining market share from the traditional brick-and-mortar stores, retailers are compelled to reconsider their footprint and eventually opt for store closures in recent years, while others unable to cope with competition have been filing bankruptcies.Particularly, amid a surge in store closures, Regional Mall REITs bore the brunt in Q1 with temporary increase in vacancies and FFO reporting an 18% decline from the prior quarter. This has also affected the overall REIT industry’s performance as excluding Regional Mall REITs, total REIT FFO would have grown 7.1% from the prior quarter, reflecting solid demand for space from other sectors.Nevertheless, Regional Mall REITs are fighting back and improving the productivity of retail assets by grabbing attention from new and productive tenants and disposing the non-productive ones. So space refilling is taking place at higher rents as is indicated by the strong releasing spreads.In case of hotel REITs too, an improving economy, growth in employment and a rise in wages are likely to drive demand for hotels. Particularly, improved business travel demand with lower cancellations and higher group spends, plus strong demand from the leisure division signal better prospects for hotel REITs.Moreover, solid dividend payouts are arguably the biggest enticement for REIT shareholders. Dividend from Equity and Mortgage REITs aggregated $14.3 billion, denoting a 3.8% sequential increase. Total dividends paid were also up 7.4% from the prior-year quarter. Also, REIT valuations look attractive as with earnings growth along with mixed stock market performance have led to the lowest aggregate price-to-FFO ratio (15.8x) since 2011.So the time is now apt to bet on some REIT stocks that have a favorable rank and solid scope for growth in a recovering economy. As a bonus point, these companies have enjoyed positive estimate revisions from analysts, reflecting their bullish sentiments.Here are the four picks:  Bethesda, MD-based Pebblebrook Hotel Trust (PEB  -  Free Report) is a hotel REIT engaged in the acquisition and investment of hotel properties mainly in upper upscale, full-service hotels situated in urban markets in major gateway cities. The stock sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and has a long-term growth rate of 5%. It is a steady performer, having beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 10.04%. Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 has been revised 3.1% upward in a month’s time.San Francisco, CA-based Prologis, Inc. (PLD  -  Free Report) is a leading industrial REIT that acquires, develops, operates and manages industrial real estate space in the United States and globally. The stock has a Zacks Rank of 2 (Buy). Backed by high period-end occupancy and improving net effective rent change, the company posted a positive surprise of 8.1% in terms of funds from operations (FFO) per share.Also, in April, Prologis announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement with DCT Industrial Trust (DCT  -  Free Report) to acquire the latter in an $8.4-billion stock-for-stock deal.

46,HST,"Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.’s (ARE  -  Free Report) robust fundamentals of the life-science industry have enabled the company’s Class A properties in AAA locations to enjoy high occupancy. Also, the company’s effort to improve credit profile is encouraging. It has an adequate capital buffer, which will likely cushion its position during any adverse situation. However, the company’s global footprint makes its profitability vulnerable to currency fluctuations. Further, near-term dilution effects from the sale of assets remain a concern for the company.Recently, this urban office real estate investment trust (REIT) reported first-quarter 2018 adjusted funds from operations (FFO) of $1.62 per share, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.59. Results reflected solid internal and external growth. Further, the company experienced an increase in rental rate and net operating income (NOI).Notably, Alexandria focuses on Class A properties concentrated in urban campuses, primarily for life science and technology entities. These locations are characterized by high barriers to entry and exit, and a limited supply of available space. This highly dynamic setting adds to the productivity and efficiency of the tenants, which, in turn, ensures steady rental revenues for the company. In fact, as of first-quarter 2018, 57% of the annual rental revenues in effect were derived from investment-grade or large-cap tenants, whereas 79% of the annual rental revenues came in from Class A properties in AAA locations.Further, the company continues to execute and deliver strong internal growth. During first-quarter 2018, same-property cash NOI growth was solid at 14.6%. Leasing activity for the quarter was also decent at around 1.5 million rentable square feet (RSF). The company carried out lease renewals and re-leasing of space at rental-rate growth of 19.0%, on a cash basis.In addition, robust external growth, in forms of development and redevelopment of new Class A properties in AAA locations, is likely to boost the company’s operating performance. In fact, during first-quarter 2018, the company placed into service 91,155 RSF at its development project at 100 Binney Street in Cambridge submarket, which is fully leased to four high-quality biotechnology entities, and 27,315 RSF at its redevelopment project at 266 and 275 Second Avenue in Route 128 submarket leased to Visterra, Inc. Further, during the aforementioned period, Alexandria commenced development projects, aggregating 651,951 RSF.Moreover, Alexandria has an adequate financial flexibility to cushion and enhance its market position. The company had $2.3 billion of liquidity as of first-quarter 2018. Also, it has a well-laddered debt-maturity schedule. Importantly, Alexandria improved its credit profile over the past two years.Nonetheless, Alexandria has exposure to Canada and Asia through its subsidiaries, which exposes it to risks from currency fluctuations. Further, the company follows the strategy of recycling capital from real estate sales, including non-core operating assets to finance pre-leased value-creation development and redevelopment projects. However, the near-term dilution effect of such moves on earnings is unavoidable.Moreover, a rise in interest rates is a challenge for Alexandria as the company has exposure to long-term leased assets. Any rise in rates would increase the cost of financing acquisitions, as well as investment and development activity expenses. Furthermore, the dividend payout itself might become less attractive than the yields on fixed income and money market accounts.Amid these, in the past six months, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has outperformed the industry it belongs to. During that time frame, shares of Alexandria have depreciated 2.9%, narrower than the 6.4% decline incurred by its industry. Further, the stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 FFO per share being revised marginally upward in a month’s time. Given its progress on fundamentals, the stock is likely to see a favorable trend in price. Stocks Worth a LookA few better-ranked stocks from the same space include Arbor Realty Trust (ABR  -  Free Report), Prologis, Inc.

This 109-room property was sold for $24 million or $220,000 per key.As of Mar 31, 2018, the hotel’s EBITDA multiple of 11.8x and a 12-month trailing cap rate of 7.6% on its net operating income was represented in the sales price.Further, revenues per available room achieved by the hotel for the 12-month period (ended Mar 31, 2018) was $122, with occupancy of 76%. The average daily rate was $161.The Residence Inn Tampa’s standing-debt balance of $19.5 million was settled prior to closing. Additionally, the debt pay-down amount of $2.9 million, relating to the release of the hotel from the loan pool, was paid off too.Notably, the company has opted to be a net seller and has not acquired any hotels since 2015. In fact, the company has sold about $350 million of hotels over this period. During first-quarter 2018, Ashford Hospitality sold SpringHill Suites Glen Allen for $10.9 million and towards the end of the quarter, it also disposed SpringHill Suites Centreville for $7.5 million.The President and chief executive officer of Ashford Trust, Douglas A. Kessler informed, ""The Residence Inn Tampa transaction demonstrates our value-added approach given pricing was at an attractive cap rate compared with our current market valuation."" He also feels that the above-mentioned sale is in sync with the company’s efforts to improve returns for shareholders, using their strategies of investing opportunistically in upper-upscale, full-service hotels in the hospitality industry.Encouragingly, in the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has outperformed the industry.

48,HST,"Hospitality Properties Trust (HPT  -  Free Report) amended and restated its credit agreement that extends its existing $1-billion unsecured revolving credit facility. Further, Hospitality Properties amended its $400-million unsecured term loan. The move is encouraging down the line for the company’s operational efficiency as it enhances the financial flexibility of the REIT.Importantly, the previous credit facility, which was set to expire on Jul 15, 2018, is now slated to mature in four years on Jul 15, 2022, unless one of the two six-month extension options is exercised to further extend the loan. In addition, the interest rate on the borrowings would be at an annual rate of LIBOR plus 100 basis points (bps), conditioned upon the company’s credit ratings compared with a rate of LIBOR plus 110 bps under its earlier facility. However, the annual facility fee of 20 bps, which is subject to the company’s credit ratings, has remained unchanged.During the three months, ending Jun 30, 2018, Hospitality Properties will be recognizing a loss on early extinguishment of debt and will write off the unamortized-debt issuance costs, totaling $748,000.Additionally, the company extended its $400-million term loan, which was due on Apr 15, 2019. It carried an annual interest rate on drawings of LIBOR plus 120 bps. Now the loan is slated to mature on Jul 15, 2023, carrying an annual interest rate of LIBOR plus 110 bps, which is conditioned upon the company’s credit ratings.Lastly, under the revised agreement, the company can increase its borrowings and commitments to up to $2.3 billion on a combined basis.The refinancing is a strategic fit for Hospitality Properties as it has reduced interest expenses and extended maturities of loans, which is likely to help the company meet its financial obligations efficiently.The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

49,HST,"Apartment Investment and Management Company (AIV  -  Free Report) — better known as Aimco — has been making diligent efforts to reposition its portfolio by shedding non-strategic properties and investing the proceeds in opportunistic acquisitions. However, the dilutive impact on earnings from such asset dispositions cannot be bypassed in the near term. Also, new supply in various markets is anticipated to dampen the company’s rent growth and new-lease pricing ability.Recently, Aimco reported in-line results for first-quarter 2018 with respect to pro forma funds from operation (FFO) per share. The results displayed growth in property net operating income (NOI), supported by same-store properties, and lease-up of redevelopment and acquisition communities. However, these positives were partially offset by lower NOI from apartment sales in 2017 and 2018.Notably, Aimco is revamping its portfolio through property sales and reinvesting the proceeds in select apartment homes with higher rents, superior margins and greater-than-expected growth. Through these efforts, the company increased its revenues per apartment home by 7% to $2,052 in first-quarter 2018. Additionally, it enhanced the quality and expected growth rate of its portfolio. In the reported quarter, the percentage of A, B and C+ home was 49%, 35% and 16%, respectively.Moreover, in April 2018, in sync with its portfolio revamping strategy, Aimco opted for the acquisition of six apartment communities in Philadelphia for $445 million. Further, the company plans to sell its asset-management portfolio along with four affordable garden-style communities for $590 million. Also, during the first quarter, the company invested $47 million in redevelopment and development. Such efforts are expected to help the company enhance its overall portfolio quality and achieve a favorable mix for long-term growth.Additionally, due to changing lifestyle, people, on an average, are settling later in life and thereby buying homes later, leading to a rising tendency of living in a rented home. Further, as renting is the only viable option for customers, who cannot avail mortgage loans or are unwilling to buy a house at present, demand for Aimco’s premium properties are expected to continue to rise in the coming quarters.Also, the company has been on track to enhance its balance sheet and liquidity position, and bring down leverage. Aimco is focusing on boosting its financial flexibility by increasing the pool of unencumbered apartment assets.Nonetheless, apartment supply remained elevated in the first quarter. Particularly, new supply is competing with some of the company’s higher-rent properties. This high supply is a concern because it curtails landlords’ ability to command more rent and results in lesser absorption.However, although Aimco’s effort to sell non-core assets and buy properties in higher-growth infill areas is a strategic fit for the long term, the dilutive impact on earnings from such asset dispositions cannot be avoided in the near term.Further, hike in interest rate remain a concern for Aimco. This is because the company’s ability to refinance existing debt would be restricted, while the interest cost on new debt would increase. This could adversely affect the company’s results and consequently dent its dividend payout.Moreover, amid rising rates, not only the financing costs will increase, but the common stock buyers will also demand a higher dividend yield and this may negatively impact the market price of the common stock.In the past three months, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has underperformed the industry. While the company’s shares have gained 3.8%, the industry has recorded 7.5% rise. Stocks Worth a LookA few better-ranked stocks from the REIT space include Arbor Realty Trust (ABR  -  Free Report), Chatham Lodging Trust (CLDT  -  Free Report) and Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.

50,HST,"SL Green Realty (SLG  -  Free Report) is revamping its portfolio by disposing of non-core assets and acquiring interests in other properties.The company announced that it has entered into an agreement to sell the fee interest at 635 Madison Avenue for a gross consideration of $151 million. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and is likely to be completed by third-quarter 2018. SL Green bought fee interest in this property for $145 million in 2014.Also, SL Green announced that it had successfully bid on the leasehold interest at 2 Herald Square, which was in the process of foreclosing on. The asset, which spans across 369,000 square feet, is conveniently located at the juncture of the Sixth Avenue, Broadway and the 34th Street. Further, the foot traffic along the corridor of 34th Street surpasses 100 million people per annum.Moreover, following the completion of this office and retail asset acquisition, SL Green plans to form a joint venture with an institutional investor based in Israel. The property boasts tenants like WeWork that is largely occupied by Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report), Victoria’s Secret and Mercy College.Shrinking its ownership in non-core assets gives SL Green an opportunity to channelize the proceeds in high-growth properties. The company is New York City's largest commercial landlord, which primarily acquires, manages, develops and leases commercial office properties in the New York Metropolitan area, especially mid-town Manhattan.However, increased supply in the company’s markets remains a concern. Also, SL Green faces intense competition from developers, owners and operators of office properties and other commercial real estates. This restricts its ability to attract and retain tenants at relatively higher rents than its competitors.Encouragingly, in the past three months, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has outperformed the industry.

51,HST,"Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc. (HST  -  Free Report) reported first-quarter 2018 adjusted funds from operations (FFO) of 43 cents per share, which outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 41 cents. However, the adjusted FFO per share fell shy of the year-ago quarter tally of 44 cents.Results reflect margin improvement through better productivity. However, the year-over-year decline mainly reflects increase in interest expenses and additional tax expenses. The company has also raised its outlook for full-year 2018.The company generated total revenues of around $1.35 billion, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.33 billion, but marginally (0.1%) slipped from the year-ago tally. The year-over-year decline mainly reflects the impact of dispositions of five hotels in 2017 and in early 2018.Notably, during the quarter, Host Hotels completed the acquisition of 301-room Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort, 668-room Grand Hyatt San Francisco and 454-room Hyatt Regency Coconut Point Resort and Spa for $1 billion.Quarter in DetailsDuring the reported quarter, comparable hotel revenues increased 1.5% year over year to nearly $1.3 billion. Comparable hotel revenue per available room or RevPAR (on a constant dollar basis) was up 1.7% year over year, driven by a 170 basis points (bps) expansion in occupancy, partly offset by a 0.6% decrease in average room rate. For domestic properties, comparable hotel RevPAR was up 1.6% while the same for International properties climbed 9.3%.For the first quarter, comparable hotel EBITDA increased 3.7%. Comparable hotel EBITDA margin improved 60 bps, reflecting improvement in operating efficiencies, higher ancillary revenues and a tax rebate at one property.Finally, the company exited first-quarter 2018 with around $323 million of unrestricted cash and $511 million of available capacity remaining under the revolver part of its credit facility. In addition, as of Mar 31, 2018, total debt was $4.3 billion, having an average maturity of 4.8 years and an average interest rate of 3.9%. Notably, the company has no debt maturities until 2020.Host Hotels did not buy back any shares in 2018. It has $500 million of capacity available under its current repurchase program.Capital InvestmentsDuring the first quarter, the company expended around $115 million on capital expenditures — $29 million was return on investment (ROI) capital projects and $86 million for renewal and replacement projects.OutlookHost Hotels has raised its outlook for full-year 2018. The company now expects 2018 adjusted FFO per share in the range of $1.67-$1.73, denoting a 5 cents increase at the midpoint from the earlier guidance of $1.60-$1.70. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is currently pegged at $1.67.The company’s full-year projection includes comparable hotel RevPAR (constant U.S. dollar basis) growth of 1.5-2.5%, reflecting growth of 50 bps at the midpoint. Moreover, the company continues to expect capital expenditures of $475-$550 million for the year. This comprises $185-$220 million in ROI projects and $290-$330 million in renewal and replacement projects.In ConclusionHost Hotels is likely to gain from its solid portfolio of upscale hotels across lucrative markets. Strategic capital-recycling program and a healthy balance sheet bode well for long-term growth. Opportunistic acquisitions in top-growth markets in the United States, including Maui and San Francisco, augur well for long-term growth. Nevertheless, supply growth, specifically in the company’s key markets, remains a concern. In addition to this, dilutive impact of asset sales cannot be bypassed. Also, rate hikes add to its woes.Host Hotels currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.

52,HST,"We are in the heart of the Q1 reporting cycle and the real estate investment trust (REIT) space is bustling with activity as there is a deluge of Q1 earnings releases lined up for this week, including Essex Property Trust, Inc. (ESS  -  Free Report), Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. (MAA  -  Free Report), The Macerich Company (MAC  -  Free Report), Federal Realty Investment Trust (FRT  -  Free Report), Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc. (HST  -  Free Report) and Equinix, Inc. (EQIX  -  Free Report). These companies are slated to release their quarterly numbers on May 2.Per our latest Earnings Preview, total Finance Sector earnings, of which REITs are a part, for the Jan-Mar quarter are expected to increase 27% based on 4.7% increase in revenues, as compared with the prior-year quarter.Particularly, with underlying asset categories and the location of properties playing a vital role in determining REITs’ performance, not all the companies in this space are equally poised to excel or fall behind, this season.Let’s have a close look at the factors that will impact the above-mentioned REITs’ first-quarter results.Mid-America Apartment Communities — commonly known as MAA — maintains a well-balanced portfolio in the Southeast and the Southwest regions of the United States. Further, favorable demographics and strong job growth in target markets are anticipated to drive demand for MAA’s properties. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter total revenues is currently pegged at $385 million, denoting projected growth of 1.6% year over year.Notably, per the latest report from the real estate technology and analytics firm — RealPage, Inc. (RP  -  Free Report) — the national apartment market remained moderated in first-quarter 2018. Annual rent growth slipped to 2.3% in Q1 which marked moderation from the 2.6-2.9% growth rate experienced throughout 2017. Occupancy level of 94.5% in March edged down from the prior-year tally of 95%. Nevertheless, the overall occupancy level is still healthy and the first quarter usually marks a slow leasing period, thanks to the cold weather that inhibits shift of householdsFurther, there is an increasing apartment supply in a number of markets of MAA. This high supply is likely to put pressure on rental rates in the to-be-reported quarter. In addition, there is high-concession activity amid elevated supply, which remains a concern.The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at $1.46, which indicates no movement on a year-over-year basis. (Read more: Mid-America Apartment Q1 Earnings: What's in Store?)Our proven model does not conclusively show that MAA is likely to beat estimates this quarter.

53,HST,"Pebblebrook Hotel Trust (PEB  -  Free Report) has kept alive the buyout battle for LaSalle Hotel Properties (LHO  -  Free Report) by enhancing its bid for the latter.The latest offer represents an implied price of $37.80 per LaSalle common share and provides a premium of 13% over affiliates of Blackstone Group LP’s (BX  -  Free Report) offer of $33.50. Moreover, it takes into account the $112-million termination fee that LaSalle needs to pay to Blackstone in case the deal is called off.Particularly, for each share of LaSalle they own, shareholders have the option to elect to receive 0.92 of a Pebblebrook share or a fixed per share cash amount of $37.80, subject to a cap of 20% in aggregate of the consideration (pro ration if oversubscribed).LaSalle has assured reviewing the proposal of Pebblebrook and do whatever will be in the best interest of its shareholders.Notably, for quite some time Pebblebrook has been in pursuit of the buyout of LaSalle Hotel Properties that owns 41 upscale hotels in 11 markets across seven states and the District of Columbia. In April, the company made an offer to acquire LaSalle in a cash-and-stock deal with consideration of 0.9085 common shares of Pebblebrook per common share of LaSalle, representing an implied price of $32.49 per share.The offer was outbid by private equity behemoth Blackstone Group LP when it agreed to acquire all outstanding common shares of LaSalle for $33.50 per share, in an all-cash deal, valuing the acquisition at $4.8 billion. LaSalle Hotel Properties and affiliates of Blackstone Group LP reached a definitive agreement for the same and then the buyout battle for LaSalle Hotel Properties seemed to have finally ended.However, Pebblebrook claims to make a “value-maximizing opportunity” for both LaSalle and Pebblebrook shareholders with its latest offer and expects the combined company to well capitalize on the improving fundamentals of the lodging industry.Per Jon E. Bortz, chairman, president and chief executive officer of Pebblebrook Hotel Trust, “The stock consideration offers LaSalle’s shareholders a more attractive opportunity from a tax perspective, and for those shareholders who want cash, the market has demonstrated that there is substantial liquidity at prices significantly above the Blackstone offer.”Especially, an improving economy, growth in employment and rise in wages are likely to drive demand for hotels. Particularly, improved business travel demand with lower cancellations and higher group spends, as well as elevated demand from the leisure division signal better prospects for hotel REITs like Pebblebrook, LaSalle and Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc. (HST  -  Free Report).Amid this, the buyout of LaSalle by Pebblebrook, which currently owns 28 hotels in nine states and the District of Columbia, would enhance its scale significantly and help leverage on the improving fundamentals.Currently, Pebblebrook carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

54,HST,"PS Business Parks, Inc. (PSB  -  Free Report) has enhanced its industrial portfolio in Northern Virginia by purchasing Fullerton Industrial Park and Northern Virginia Industrial Park in Springfield, VA. The company shelled out $143.3 million for the acquisition of this 1.1-million-square-foot multi-tenant industrial portfolio which comprises 19 buildings on 65 acres of land.The move has particularly strengthened PS Business Parks’ presence in the Springfield/Newington industrial sub-market. In fact, with the latest acquisitions and the company’s existing three industrial parks, aggregating 606,000 square feet of space, PS Business Parks currently enjoys a solid 11% submarket concentration.With PS Business Parks’ proven expertise, the previously owned properties have been enjoying historical average occupancy of 95% since 2000. This raises hopes for achieving higher occupancy of the latest acquired portfolio which is currently 76% occupied and offers scope for the company to make capital upgrades.Moreover, with the acquired portfolio being advantageously located in a densely populated region next to Fort Belvoir and south of the Pentagon, and having solid transportation access, demand for space is likely to escalate.In fact, companies are being compelled to enhance and renovate their distribution and production platforms, in order to address a large customer base and urbanization, as well as support e-commerce business. Services like same-day delivery are gaining traction, propelling demand for modern industrial facilities.These have made industrial REITs fire on all cylinders and per a study by the commercial real estate services firm — CBRE Group Inc. (CBRE) — availability fell for 31 straight quarters to 7.3% for the U.S. industrial market in first-quarter 2018. Additionally, with demand surpassing new supply, net asking rents inched up1.9% in Q1 to $7.01 per square feet, denoting the highest level since 1989.Going forward too, with a recovering economy and job market gains, as well as tax reforms, consumption levels are anticipated to remain elevated. And with a healthy manufacturing environment and high business inventories, demand for warehouse and industrial real estate is anticipated to be high.For PS Business Parks, healthy fundamentals in the multi-tenant flex, office and industrial asset categories are anticipated to stoke growth in the near-to-medium term. In addition, the company’s financial flexibility keeps us optimistic. Nonetheless, supply is rising in certain submarkets and this could cast a pall on the company’s growth momentum. Also, rate hike adds to its woes.PS Business Parks currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

55,HST,"Public Storage (PSA  -  Free Report) is one of the largest owners and operators of storage facilities in the United States. The ‘Public Storage’ brand is the most recognized and established name in the self-storage industry, with presence in all major metropolitan markets of the nation. Further, the company has managed to create a significant presence in the European markets as well through the Shurgard Storage Centers’ acquisition.Moreover, the self-storage industry’s fundamentals are likely to be driven by favorable demographic changes, and events like marriages, shifting, death and even divorce. Also, this REIT has the power to adjust its rents quickly to any rate hike due to shorter leasing periods.In addition, the company has been capitalizing on growth opportunities. Recently, Public Storage announced the opening of a new self-storage facility in one of Seattle’s popular suburbs. Specifically, The Public Storage located at 16311 Meridian Ave E Puyallup, WA, will accommodate more than 1,200 storage spaces. Notably, Puyallup is witnessing an influx of new residents from Seattle who are looking for more affordable housing in Puyallup. Hence, a new storage facility amid high demand will likely enable the company to enjoy elevated occupancy.Since January 2016, 127 self-storage facilities have been acquired and developed by the company. Particularly, during 2017, the company acquired 22 self-storage facilities, comprising 1.4 million net rentable square feet, for $149.8 million. Additionally, in first-quarter 2018, Public Storage acquired two self-storage facilities, comprising 0.2 million net rentable square feet of area, for $18 million. Further, as of Mar 31, 2018, the company was under contract to acquire three self-storage facilities, spanning 0.2 million net rentable square feet of space, for $19 million. Such acquisitions and expansions bode well for long-term growth.Public Storage also delivered a decent performance in the first quarter. The company’s core funds from operations (FFO) per share of $2.48 marked 4.6% growth from the prior-year quarter figure of $2.37. The figure also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.46. Results highlight improvement in net operating income from same-store and non-same-store facilities. Higher realized annual rent per occupied square foot supported the company’s same-store performance. Additionally, Public Storage benefited from its expansion efforts.Furthermore, shares of Public Storage have outperformed the industry it belongs to in the past three months. The company’s shares increased 7.6%, while the industry reported growth of 5%. Moreover, the trend in estimate revisions indicates a favorable earnings outlook for the current year.However, supply has been high in a number of markets and this affects the company’s pricing power. In fact, the company operates in a highly fragmented market in the United States, with intense competition from numerous private, regional and local operators. This limits its power to raise rents and turn on more discounting.The company has a significant development and refurbishment pipeline. In fact, as of Mar 31, 2018, it had several facilities in development (2.7 million net rentable square feet), with an estimated cost of $381 million, as well as expansion projects (2.3 million net rentable square feet), worth roughly $281 million.Public Storage estimates to incur the remaining $382 million of development costs related to these projects mainly over the next 18 months. Though this is encouraging, the substantial pipeline increases operational risks and exposes the company to rising construction costs, entitlement delays and failure to fulfill government requirements. Further, self-storage spaces are not usually pre-leased and new assets generally take time to generate yields.Also, hike in interest rate is a concern for the company. Essentially, rising rates imply higher borrowing cost for the company. Moreover, the dividend payout might become less attractive than yields on fixed income and money market accounts.Public Storage currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Stocks to ConsiderA few better-ranked stocks from the real estate space include Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.

However, results in the year-ago period included one-time merger-related costs of 55 cents per share.The company’s quarterly results reflect growth in same-property net operating income (NOI).Adjusted revenues for the quarter came in at $269.5 million, outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $263.1 million. In addition, the figure came in higher than the year-ago tally of $189.4 million.Inside the HeadlinesDuring the reported quarter, Regency executed around 1.0 million square feet of new and renewal leases on a comparable basis, leading to 8.4% blended rent spreads.

Also, it reflects adjustments for the Equity One merger.Regency’s cash and cash equivalents were $93.6 million at the end of first-quarter 2018, up from $49.4 million recorded at the end of 2017. The company’s total outstanding debt was $3.8 billion, up from $3.6 billion witnessed at the end of the previous year.However, during the reported quarter, the company completed a public offering of $300 million 4.125% notes due 2028, as well as increased the size of its unsecured revolving credit facility to $1.25 billion, with maturity extension to 2023.Notable Portfolio ActivityDuring the quarter under review, the company closed on $64.9 million of acquisitions and $3.5 million of dispositions.At the first-quarter end, the company had 19 properties in development or redevelopment with combined, estimated net development costs of approximately $454 million.OutlookRegency expects FFO per share of $3.74-$3.79 compared with the previous guidance of $3.73-$3.82.

The company has been focusing on building a premium portfolio of grocery-anchored shopping centers, which are usually necessity driven and enjoy dependable traffic. However, recent efforts of online retailers to penetrate deeper into the grocery business have emerged as a concern.

In addition, key leases executed in the quarter included 593,765 RSF at 1655 and 1725 Third Street property in the Mission Bay/SoMa submarket leased to Uber Technologies, Inc. and 192,070 RSF at Summers Ridge Science Park in Sorrento Mesa submarket leased to Quidel Corporation.On a year-over-year basis, same-property NOI grew 4.0%.

58,HST,"Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc. (HST  -  Free Report) is slated to report first-quarter 2018 results after the market closes on May 2.In the last-reported quarter, this Bethesda, MD-based lodging real estate investment trust (REIT) delivered a positive surprise of around 7.7%, with respect to funds from operations (FFO) per share. Results highlighted margin improvement through better productivity.The company has a decent surprise history. In fact, over the preceding four quarters, the company posted surprises in three occasions, with an average beat of 6.8%. This is depicted in the graph below: Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc. QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors That Might Impact Q1 ResultsHost Hotels boasts a portfolio of upscale hotels across potential markets in the United States. Also, the company is making concerted efforts to enhance its portfolio quality through strategic capital-recycling program. The lodging REIT has been making well-planned redevelopments to fortify its position in vibrant markets.Moreover, the company is enhancing its portfolio with strategic assets like the three Hyatt-managed hotels, while monetizing a considerable part of real estate in Washington D.C. and lowering its exposure in New York.Host Hotels also has a decent balance sheet and ample liquidity. The company’s Q1 performance is expected to display improvement in productivity at many of its hotels.However, though supply growth has been sluggish in the past, it has gathered momentum, of late. In fact, growth is expected to remain elevated in 2018, particularly in markets where the company has exposure.Moreover, in the fourth-quarter 2017 conference call, management had stated that the company’s performance is likely to be the weakest in first-quarter 2018. This is due to tough comparisons resulting from inauguration and Women's March in D.C. last year as well as Easter weekend beginning on Mar 30 this year.Notably, the company usually reaps 23-24% of its total EBITDA in the Jan-Mar quarter. In addition to this, dilutive impact of asset sales cannot be bypassed. Also, rate hike is another key concern for this REIT.Amid these, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter revenues is pegged at $1.32 billion, indicating an expected decline of 1.9% year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Room Revenues is pegged at $824 million, down from $847 million reported in the prior quarter. The Food and Beverage revenues estimate is pegged at $413 million which is slightly above the $409 million generated in the prior quarter.In fact, there was lack of any solid catalyst for being positive on the stock. Therefore, in a month’s time, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of FFO per share for the first quarter remained unchanged at 40 cents. The figure denotes an estimated decrease of 9.1% year over year.However, Host Hotels’ shares have gained 8.0% over the past month, outperforming 2.3% growth recorded by its industry.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Host Hotels will likely beat estimates this season. This is because a stock needs to have both — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) — for this to happen.

59,HST,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc. (HST  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 2.5% in that time frame.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is HST due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Host Hotels' Q4 FFO Beats Estimates, Revenues Grow Y/YHost Hotels & Resorts reported fourth-quarter 2017 adjusted FFO of 42 cents per share, which outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 39 cents. The adjusted FFO per share also climbed 2.4% from the year-ago quarter tally of 41 cents.Results reflect margin improvement through better productivity. The company also announced that it has signed an agreement to acquire three Hyatt-managed hotels.The company posted total revenues of $1.34 billion which grew 0.5% year over year but narrowly missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.35 billion.For full-year 2017, the company delivered adjusted FFO per share of $1.69, unchanged from the previous year. However, revenues edged down 0.8% year over year to around $5.4 billion, as a result of revenue loss from the sale of 14 hotels in 2016 and 2017. Also, Hurricanes Harvey and Irma adversely affected total revenues in the year.Acquisitions and DispositionsHost Hotels is on track with its strategic capital-recycling efforts. Following the year end, Host Hotels completed the sale of the Key Bridge Marriott for $190 million. Further, the company is under contract to sell the W New York for $190 million.

60,HST,"Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc. (HST  -  Free Report) is likely to gain from its solid portfolio of upscale hotels across potential markets. Furthermore, the company is anticipated to improve the revenue per available room (RevPAR) backed by its value enhancement initiatives. Moreover, demand is likely to benefit amid improving corporate profits, business investment, consumer sentiment and low unemployment level.Last month, the company reported fourth-quarter 2017 adjusted funds from operations (FFO) of 42 cents per share, which outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 39 cents. Results reflect margin improvement through better productivity.Importantly, Host Hotels undertakes a strategic capital-recycling program to enhance its portfolio quality and strengthen its position over global vibrant markets. Furthermore, the company has been monetizing a considerable part of real estate in Washington D.C. and lowering its exposure in New York.In fact, following the end of the prior year, the company has completed the sale of the Key Bridge Marriott for $190 million. Further, it is under contract to sell the W New York for $190 million.

This provides the company ample scope for deploying capital for long-term growth opportunities and at the same time, carrying out redevelopment initiatives.Though supply growth has been lackluster in the past, it has gathered momentum in recent times. In fact, this growth is expected to remain elevated in 2018, particularly in markets where the company has exposure. Furthermore, the company’s performance might be weak in first-quarter 2018 due to tough comparisons resulting from inauguration and Women's March in D.C. last year, as well as Easter weekend beginning on Mar 30 this year.In addition to this, the dilutive impact of asset sales cannot be bypassed. Also, rate hike remains another concern.Shares of Host Hotels have outperformed the industry it belongs to, in the past six months.

62,HST,"Welltower Inc.  is slated to report fourth-quarter and 2017 results before the market opens on Feb 22. The company’s funds from operations (FFO) per share and its revenues are anticipated to witness a decline year over year.Last quarter, this healthcare real estate investment trust (REIT) reported better-than-expected FFO per share. Moreover, same-store net operating income from senior housing grew 4.1% year over year in the quarter.Over the trailing four quarters, Welltower posted in-line FFO in one occasion and beat estimates in the other three, recording an average positive surprise of 1.4%. The graph below depicts the surprise history:Welltower Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Welltower Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Welltower Inc.

While the company’s shares have lost 22.5%, the industry has declined 7%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to Influence Q4 ResultsWelltower’s strategy of expanding its seniors’ housing portfolio in top metro markets, specifically in the West Coast is anticipated to benefit the company in the quarter-to-be-reported. Moreover, the company is set to acquire a portfolio of four rental continuing care retirement communities and convert those to a RIDEA structure.Further, it has secured a major institutional investor for the development of an assisted living and memory care community in midtown Manhattan. These moves fortify its healthcare asset portfolio.Welltower’s efforts to enhance its healthcare real estate portfolio quality through prudent asset allocation and disposal, along with a diversified portfolio, are anticipated to drive its performance in the quarter under review. Additionally, rising senior-citizen population will likely prove conducive to growth.Welltower’s activities during the quarter could not gain adequate analyst confidence. Consequently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Q4 FFO has witnessed downward estimate revision of 0.95% to $1.04 in a month’s time. Further, it indicates a decline of 5.5% year over year.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $1.08 billion, indicating a year-over-year drop of 0.25%.For full-year 2017, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is $4.29 billion, reflecting a marginal rise year over year. The consensus estimate for FFO per share is $4.24, reflecting a year-over-year decline of 6.8%. Management expects core FFO per share in the range of $4.19-$4.25.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Welltower will likely beat estimates this season.

The company’s funds from operations (FFO) per share are likely to remain stable whereas its revenues are anticipated to witness a rise year over year.Last quarter, this monthly-dividend-paying real estate investment trust (REIT) reported better-than-expected performance, in terms of FFO per share. Results indicated higher-than-expected growth in revenues.However, Realty Income has a mixed surprise history. The company surpassed estimates in three occasions and met in one, over the trailing four quarters, resulting in an average positive surprise of 1.33%. This is depicted in the graph below: Realty Income Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Realty Income Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Realty Income Corporation QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderRealty Income’s portfolio is well diversified with respect to tenant, industry, geography and property type. It targets well-located, free-standing, single-tenant and net-lease commercial properties. The company generates the majority of its annualized retail rental revenue from tenants with a service, non-discretionary and/or low-price point component to their business. Thus, such businesses are less susceptible to economic recessions, as well as competition from Internet retailing.However, the retail real estate market remained turbulent amid retailer bankruptcies and store closures. Moreover, competition remained solid in the quarter. In addition, the company has substantial exposure to single-tenant assets which raises its risks associated with tenant default.Amid these, growth in same-store rent is likely to be modest. In fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for rental revenues for the to-be-reported quarter is currently pegged at $297 million, reflecting around 1.4% increase from the prior quarter.Realty Income’s activities during the quarter failed to gain analysts’ confidence. Consequently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter FFO per share remained unchanged at 77 cents over the last 30 days.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $307.3 million, indicating a year-over-year rise of 6.8%.For full-year 2017, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is $1.20 billion, reflecting a rise of 9.1% year over year. The consensus estimate for FFO per share is $2.99, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 3.82%. Management expects core FFO per share in the range of $3.03-$3.07.Realty Income has lost 13.7% of its value in the past six months underperforming the 8.8% growth recorded by the industry.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Realty Income will likely beat estimates this season.

Its funds from operations (FFO) per share as well as revenues are anticipated to be up year over year in the to-be-reported quarter.Last quarter, this self-storage real estate investment trust (REIT) delivered better-than-expected performance, witnessing a positive surprise of 0.38%. Results mirror an improvement in net operating income (NOI) from both same-store and non-same store facilities.  The company has a mixed surprise history. In fact, it exceeded estimates in two occasions and missed in the other two, over the trailing four quarters, resulting in an average negative surprise of 3.08%. This is depicted in the graph below:Public Storage Price and EPS Surprise  Public Storage Price and EPS Surprise | Public Storage QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderPublic Storage is one of the largest owners and operators of storage facilities in the United States. The ‘Public Storage’ brand is the most recognized and established name in the self-storage industry. Further, the company has managed to create a significant presence in the European markets through the Shurgard Storage Centers buyout.Its solid presence in key cities serves as a major growth driver. Also, acquisition and expansion initiatives are likely to stoke growth. In addition, the self-storage industry is anticipated to experience solid demand backed by favorable demographic changes, improving job market and rising incomes, as well as events like marriages, shifting, death and even divorce.As such, in the quarter under review, the company remains well poised to experience growth in revenues. In fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $680.5 million, depicting projected growth of 4.5%.Supply has been rising in a number of markets and this adversely affects the company’s pricing power. In fact, it operates in a highly fragmented market in the United States, with intense competition from numerous private, regional and local operators. This limits its power to raise rents and turn on more discounting.In addition, over the past 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share for the quarter remained unchanged at $2.72. It reflects a year-over-year improvement of 2.6%.Furthermore, in the past one month, shares of Public Storage have lost 2.6%, outperforming its industry’s descend of 4.1%.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Public Storage will likely beat estimates this season.

Further, the company on a pro rata basis for the total portfolio for the quarter generated new leasing and renewal leasing spreads of 23.9% and 2.2%, repestively, in the reported quarter.DDR reported a leased rate of 93.2% as of Dec 31, 2017 compared with 95.0% at 2016-end on a pro rata basis for the total portfolio.Annualized base rent per occupied square-foot for the total portfolio increased 6.5% on a pro rata basis to $16.46 as of Dec 31, 2017 from $15.46 a year ago.Notably, DDR sold 14 shopping centers and land parcels for a total sale price of $590.1 million during the quarter under review, thereby aggregating $246 million at DDR's share.Moreover, the company repaid $104 million of mortgage-debt, scheduled to mature in 2018.DDR exited the fourth quarter with $92.6 million in cash compared with $30.4 million as of Dec 31, 2016.OutlookDDR provided guidance for 2018 except for OFFO, which was provided for the third quarter of 2018 for New DDR. The New DDR provided marks for the results of the assets that are going to remain within the company after the completion of the $900-million disposition program and the spin-off of RVI.For third-quarter 2018, the OFFO is going to be at least 15 cents. Whereas the same store NOI growth is projected at a minimum 1.5% for the full year.Further, RVI fee income is anticipated to be around $10 million for the year.Bottom LineIn December 2017, DDR announced its board's decision to spin off a portfolio of 50 sellable assets into a separate public-traded REIT. This move might help the company streamline its portfolio and focus on the core markets. Further, this aggressive capital-recycling program is expected to drive the company's growth over the long term.However, the choppy retail real estate environment is anticipated to limit demand for space in the near term, thanks to the shift in customers’ shopping preferences toward online purchases. Also, an aggressive asset disposition is likely to leave a dilutive effect on earnings. Hike in interest rate further adds to the comany's woes.DDR Corp. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise DDR Corp.

The company offers a wide array of well-located storage units to its customers, including boat storage, recreational vehicle storage and business storage.In addition, the self-storage industry is anticipated to experience a solid demand, backed by favorable demographic changes and events like marriages, shifting, death and even divorce. As such, its high brand value and robust presence in key cities serve as growth drivers amid healthy demand in the self-storage industry.The company has also made concerted efforts to grow its business and achieve geographical diversity through accretive acquisitions, mutually beneficial joint-venture partnerships and third-party management services.Amid these, in the to-be-reported quarter, the company is anticipated to benefit from a steady demand in the self-storage industry and witness growth in same-store revenues and NOI.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $252 million for property rental revenue reflects a sequential rise from the prior-quarter figure of $249 million.Prior to fourth-quarter earnings release, there is a lack of any solid catalyst for raising optimism about the company’s business activities and prospects.

73,HST,"SL Green Realty Corp. (SLG  -  Free Report) is slated to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 18, after the market closes.Last quarter, this office real estate investment trust (REIT) reported better-than-expected funds from operations (FFO) per share.Over the trailing four quarters, the company exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two occasions, met in another and missed in the other, with an average beat of around 4.29%. The graph below depicts this surprise history. SL Green Realty Corporation Price and EPS Surprise SL Green Realty Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | SL Green Realty Corporation QuoteLet’s see how things have shaped up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderThe company has been boosting its capacity to offer office space through an opportunistic investment policy. This bodes well for SL Green amid an improving economy and job-market environment.In addition, per a recent study from CBRE Group Inc. , the U.S. office vacancy rate contracted 10 basis points (bps) in the to-be-reported quarter amid growth in office-using jobs. In most of the U.S. office markets, vacancy declined, taking the national office vacancy rate close to its post-recession low.However, new supply in the Manhattan area could negate the positive effect of decreasing vacancy rates. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter property net operating income (NOI) and net rental revenues are currently pegged at $183 million and $281 million, nearly in line with the previous quarter reported figures.  Also, over the past seven days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of FFO per share for the third quarter edged down 0.6% to $1.57, reflecting lack of any solid catalyst for being overtly positive on the stock. Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that SL Green will likely beat estimates this season.

Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc. QuoteNote: The EPS numbers presented in the above chart represent funds from operations (“FFO”) per share.Quarter in DetailsDuring the reported quarter, comparable hotel revenues remained nearly flat year over year at $1.3 billion. Although, the company witnessed improvements in RevPAR, it was marred by a decline in food and beverage revenues.Comparable RevPAR (on a constant dollar basis) was up 1.7% year over year, driven by a 0.8% increase in average room rate and 70 basis points (bps) expansion in occupancy to 83.2%. At its domestic properties, comparable hotel RevPAR inched up 1.8%. However, the same at its comparable international properties was down 3.1% on a constant-dollar basis.Nevertheless, improvements in RevPAR aided GAAP operating profit margin growth of 50 bps for the quarter.During the quarter under review, the company invested around $16 million for redevelopment, and return on investment (ROI) capital expenditures. It also deployed approximately $47 million on renewal and replacement capital expenditures.In the second quarter, the company accomplished the sale of the Sheraton Memphis Downtown for $67 million, recording a gain of around $28 million.Finally, the company exited second-quarter 2017 with around $644 million of unrestricted cash and $775 million of available capacity remaining under the revolver part of its credit facility. Moreover, as of Jun 30, 2017, total debt was $4.0 billion, having an average maturity of 5.5 years and an average interest rate of 3.9%. Notably, the company did not buy back any shares in 2017. It has $500 million of capacity available under its current repurchase program.OutlookHost Hotels raised its outlook for full-year 2017. The company now expects adjusted FFO per share in the range of $1.64–$1.68 compared to the prior guidance of $1.60–$1.68. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is currently pegged at $1.66.This is backed by comparable hotel RevPAR (constant U.S. dollar basis) growth expectations of 1.00–1.75%, against the prior outlook of 0.0–2.0%.In ConclusionWe are encouraged with the better-than-expected performance of Host Hotels in the second quarter. The company’s solid portfolio of upscale hotels across lucrative markets, strategic capital-recycling program and a healthy balance sheet bode well for long-term growth. However, supply growth, specifically in the company’s key markets, remains a concern. In addition, dilutive impact of asset sales cannot be bypassed. Also, rate hike add to its woes.Host Hotels currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).
